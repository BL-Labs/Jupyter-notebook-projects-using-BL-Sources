The Channel Pilot, Part 2, contains Sailing Directions for the northern coast of France, from Ushant to Dunkerque, together with the Channel Islands. The directions for the French coast were originally compiled from the Pilote Francais, edited by M. Givry from the valuable surveys made by M. Beautemps-Beaupre, between the years 1836-43 ; and also from the surveys of Captain Martin White, R.N., in the years 1812-29. The first edition of this work was compiled by Staff-Commander J. W. King, R.N., of the Hydrographic Department, Admiralty, from the above sources, and published in 1859. The directions for the Channel islands were prepared by Staff- Commander John Richards during the Admiralty survey of those islands in the years 1859-70, and published in March, 1870. The second edition of Channel Pilot, Part 2, was revised and corrected by Staff-Commander G. F. McDougall, R.N., of the Hydro graphic Department, in December, 1870, who embodied the Sailing Directions for the Channel Islands above alluded to. The third edition was revised by Staff-Commander G. H. Allen, R.N., in 1875. The fourth edition was revised by Staff-Commander Hitchfield, R.N., of the Hydrographic Department, in 1882. The present edition has been revised and corrected by Captain E. H. Hills, R.N., from information derived from the most recent charts and works published by the French Government, and from various other sources. In this edition, the construction of the work has been altered in conformity with the plan adopted in Channel Pilot, Part 1 ; the description of the French coast commencing in the West and proceeding regularly eastward. Seamen are invited to transmit to the Secretary of the Admiralty notices of any errors or omissions they may detect in this work, in order that the information may be applied for the benefit of navigation.

Ushant or Ile d'Ouessant 19\u00b0 10' W. 18\u00b0 40' W. lie de Bas GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\u2014 Having in Channel Pilot, Part I., given a full description of the outer soundings, currents, and various lines of approach to the English Channel, and described the southern coast of England from Land's End to the North Foreland, it is proposed in Part II., to repeat such portions as apply more particularly to the approaches to Ushant and to describe the northern coast of France from Ushant or Ile d'Ouessant to Dunkerque, including the Channel Islands. In this navigation, it is important the mariner should make himself acquainted with the general system of winds in the Channel, as well as with the subject of fogs and mirage ; and, therefore, a brief notice of these is given It is only necessary to add the caution that the wind has considerable effect on the strength and direction of the tidal streams, as well as on the range of the tides ; and, that winds from between N.W. and N.E., which are the smooth-water winds on the English coast, are those which produce the heaviest seas on the French shores. A * See Admiralty Charts : \u2014 North coast of France, sheet VIII., Ile d'Ouessant to les Sept-Iles, No. 2,644 ; scale, m = 0-5 inch, and Channel Islands and coast of Prance, No. 2,66'J b. ; scale, in = 0*5 inch.

It is desirable that the seaman should have a knowledge of the weather signals used at French ports in addition to the usual storm warnings ; also, of the signals established for indicating the depth of water at the entrance of French ports, and of the system adopted for colouring buoys and beacons ; the rules and regulations on these subjects are therefore given before proceeding to the description of Ushant. \"WINDS.\u2014 The prevailing winds in the Channel are westerly, and they greatly preponderate over easterly winds. From October to March inclusive, westerly gales are most frequent, often lasting three or four days ; during May, June, and July, they are comparatively rare. South-westerly gales are very dangerous in the eastern part of the Channel, are generally accompanied by rain, and the wind, blowing in violent gusts, sometimes veers suddenly to N.W., North, or even to N.E., without losing strength, and causing a heavy sea on the French coast southward of Cape Grisnez. Should the wind continue from the northward with a rising barometer, its force usually moderates and the weather becomes fine ; but, should it back to the S.W. with a falling barometer, bad weather is sure to return. It has been remarked that gales which occur during spring tides are generally more violent and lasting than those which take place during neaps, and that they acquire their greatest strength at the beginning of the flood. Winds from North to N.E. are sometimes strong at both entrances to the Channel, but seldom acquire the force of a gale in its central portion except on the French shore ; they do not usually last so long nor does the wind shift as with those from the westward. They cause a heavy sea on the flood stream, and, during their continuance, the land is generally covered with a white fog resembling smoke, an appearance common during all easterly winds which sometimes, when of moderate force, blow with great persistence. South-easterly winds, accompanied by rain and a falling barometer, almost always become gales ; these are off-shore and therefore smooth-water winds on the French coast, but their continuance from that quarter seldom lasts long ; for, gales in the Channel being mostly of a cyclonic character and travelling eastward, a change of wind is to be expected, and the direction of the change depends on whether the position of the vessel is northward or southward of the track of the storm's centre. If southward of it, the wind veers from S.E. to South, and West ; if northward, it backs to East and North. Seamen should bear in mind the well-known rule for ascer-"], [23, "Chap. L] 3 WINDS. \u2014 FOGS AND MIRAGE. taining the position of a storm's centre, or, in other words, of the area of low barometric pressure round which the wind circulates, when in the northern hemisphere, viz. \u2014 to face the wind, when this central depression will be from 8 to 12 points to the right of its direction. Careful attention to the barometer and to any changes in the direction of the wind give a sure clue to future probable changes. Moderate winds from N.W. to N.E. bring fine weather. In the Channel, during summer, regular land and sea breezes frequently become established in fine settled weather ; at night, it then falls calm and a heavy dew ensues. When there is little or no dew, it is a sign of an impending change of weather. Calms are of rare occurrence, even in summer, and do not last long. In winter, they are generally precursors of bad weather, of which there are no more certain indications than swell in the offing and surf on the coast during a calm. In some winters snow is abundant ; the wind is often fresh and baffling in snow squalls, and the falling snow effectually obscures all objects from view. After a snow shower, there is often great difficulty in recognizing the coast which may be in sight, the snow completely altering its aspect. A change from rain to hail often accompanies or precedes sudden changes in the wind from a southerly to a more northerly direction. The peculiar configuration of the land as well as the great rise and fall of tide in the Gulf of St. Malo appears to influence to a certain degree the winds and weather in that neighbourhood and amongst the Channel Islands ; remarks on these local winds will be found at page 193. Fog's and Mirage. \u2014 Fogs are frequent in all parts of the Channel. In summer, they generally hide the land in the morning only and disperse as the sun acquires strength. The moist haze accompanying westerly winds is more tenacious and only yields to a freshening breezy ; it then frequently turns to rain and marks the commence ment of bad weather. In the eastern part of the Channel, it is rare for the land to be entirely free from mist except previously to strong north-easterly winds, when it may be distinctly seen from a great distance. Westerly winds, as before remarked, frequently bring mist, rain, and low dense clouds, which conceal the land from view. With easterly winds, the haze which covers the land is dense in pro portion as the wind is strong and lasting. Mirage is most frequent on the French coast, especially in the bight between Cape Barfleur and Cape d'Antifer ; it is considered an A 2"], [24, "4 [Chap. I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. indication of fine weather if it tends only to enlarge the apparent size of objects ; but, when it distorts and renders them difficult of recognition, it is usually followed by rain or by strong easterly winds. When mirage is prevalent about sunset, it may be expected that as night draws on the Channel lights will become visible at much greater distances than under ordinary circumstances. SOUNDINGS.\u2014 South-westward of Ushant, the 100-fathoms line of soundings is from 65 to 75 miles distant from that island ; the whole extent of the edge of soundings may always be discovered in fine weather by the numerous ripplings in its vicinity, and, in boisterous weather, by the sudden alterations in the colour of the water from blue to a disturbed green. On the Parallel of Ushant, 48\u00b0 28' N., the 100-fathoms edge of soundings is much more distant ; here it is found in about long. 9\u00b0 35' W., but for 55 miles westward of this meridian are very irregular depths ; several spots having less than 100 fathoms, with depths between them in some cases of over 1,000 fathoms. At 20 miles eastward of 9\u00b0 35' W. the water shoals to 84 fathoms, but this parallel bordering so closely on the 100-fathoms edge of soundings, the depths are very irregular until as far eastward as 7\u00b0 30' W. The Little Sole Bank in long. 8\u00b0 58' W. is only 6 miles southward of the parallel of Ushant ; it has from 66 to 69 fathoms, is 9 miles in extent E.S.E. and W.N.W., and its southern edge is close to the 100-fathoms line, beyond which the depths increase rapidly. From the shoalest part of the Little Sole Bank, 66 fathoms, Ushant N.W. lighthouse bears E. by S. f S. 148 miles. Passing 6 miles northward of the bank, the depths are from 95 to 90 fathoms, fine light sand and pieces of ribbed shells ; 15 miles farther eastward and 135 miles from Ushant, 88 fathoms, with similar bottom, and, as far as long. 7\u00b0 30' W., the depth varies between 88 and 94 fathoms. As Ushant is approached, from this meridian, the progressive shoaling is very gradual, the 70-fathoms line being only reached in long. 6\u00b0 8' W. The north-eastern end of Parsons' Bank is, however, crossed in 6\u00b0 20' W., and here, within a distance of 6 or 8 miles, the depth decreases from 86 to 68 fathoms, and deepens again to 74 fathoms. The shoalest part of Parsons' Bank, however, lies southward of this parallel, and from lat. 48\u00b0 26' N., long. 6\u00b0 30' W., it has a depth of only 56 or 59 fathoms for about 6 miles to the south-westward. After passing eastward of this bank, the depths are 72 to 70 fathoms, coarse pale yellow ground resembling semi-indurated marl with a"], [25, "Chap. L] SOUNDINGS\u2014 CURRENTS.\u2014 VARIATION. 5 mealy surface, interspersed with broken pieces of shells and a sub stance like chaff. At 27 miles from Ushant, the depths are from 66 to 63 fathoms, fine sand or sand and shells, and 66 fathoms has been found within 5 miles of the rocks. In thick weather, as a general rule, do not come into less than 70 fathoms when approaching Ushant from the southward or south westward, until certain of being northward of its parallel, and keep the lead constantly going ; but, observe that 53 or 54 miles from Ushant, less water may be found on the Kaiser-i-hind bank, which, from lat. 48\u00b0 4' N. long. 6\u00b0 19' W., extends for at least 11 miles N.E., with depths of from 66 to 63 fathoms ; deeper water, however, lies between this bank and the 70-fathoms line of soundings. ROUNDING USHANT.\u2014 Steam-vessels leaving the Channel for the southward should, if possible, sight and pass Ushant about 10 miles distant. Sailing vessels, except those from the western French ports, should not as a rule sight it, but, even with a fair wind, make every effort to obtain good westing, bearing in mind that the prevailing winds and set of the ocean being from that direction, have a tendency to set them towards Ushant and into the Bay of Biscay when southward of it ; therefore, it is of the highest importance to keep well to the westward. Steam-vessels entering the Channel from the southward should exercise great caution in rounding Ushant. The island is surrounded by dangers ; rocks are numerous, the channels intricate, fogs and thick weather common, and the tides strong. Round Ushant, the flood sets north-eastward and the ebb south-westward, at the rate of 3 or 4 knots during springs, the flood stream turning more eastward, and thus setting more directly towards the rocks, as the tide slacks. Between Ushant and the Saints, the flood tide sets eastward and the ebb westward. Steamers should round Ushant about ten miles distant unless bound for western French ports, when in clear weather it may be rounded more closely, but not nearer than five miles. When thick weather prevails, it should be given a wide berth. The old rule of not coming within a depth of 70 fathoms until northward of the parallel of Ushant is a safe one. Currents. \u2014 In approaching Ushant, the effect of current requires careful consideration, for, the currents in this vicinity being merely the prolonged movements of the water resulting from recent and probably remote gales, their actual direction may differ from that indicated by the run of the swell. It is known that westerly gales forcing the water into the Bay of Biscay cause it there to accumulate until it forms a head of water which then flows northward along the"], [26, "6 [Chap. I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. French shore and north-westward across the mouth of the English Channel. This current does not seem to be frequently experienced to any great extent, but it may attain a rate of 1 or 1^ knots an hour, and the knowledge of its possible existence, coupled with the known strength of the tides in the neighbourhood of Ushant, should induce great caution in making that island. Variation Of the Compass.\u2014 The amount of variation for the year 1888 at the principal ports and headlands of the French coast and Channel Islands will be found at the head of each chapter. The general direction of the lines of equal variation is S.S.W. and N.N.E. (true). Strict attention should be paid to the correction of course required by the continuous change in variation when proceeding up or down Channel, especially if steaming or sailing at a high speed. The difference in variation between Ushant and Dunkerque is 3\u00b0, the variation decreasing as a vessel proceeds eastward. The annual decrease of variation at present is about 7-5'. BAROMETER. \u2014 The average range of the barometer in the higher latitudes, i.e. 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, is about 1-5 inches, but, on extra ordinary occasions, ranges of 2\" 75 and 3 inches have been recorded. In the northern hemisphere the effect of the veering of the wind on the barometer is according to the following law : \u2014 With East, S.E., and South winds, the barometer falls. S.W. winds, the barometer ceases to fall and begins to rise. \u201e West, N.W., and North winds, the barometer rises. \u201e N.E. winds, the barometer ceases to rise and begins to fall. By the knowledge of the barometric pressure at a number of places 100 or 200 miles apart, we may know with considerable certainty a few hours in advance, from which direction the wind may be expected to blow at any place, according to the law discovered by, and bearing the name of, Professor Buys Ballot. The rule is, \" Stand with your left hand towards the place where the barometric reading is lowest and your right hand towards where it is highest ; you will then have your back to the direction from which the wind may be expected to blow.\" This rule applies to the northern hemis phere but must be reversed in southern latitudes. Thermometer. \u2014 The thermometer in the northern hemisphere rises with East, S.E., and South winds. With a S.W. wind it ceases to rise and begins to fall. It falls with West, N.W., and North winds, with N.E. winds it ceases to fall and begins to rise. FRENCH STORM SIGNALS.\u2014 These signals resemble those formerly in use on the English coasts where, however, the cone only"], [27, "Chap. I. J BAROMETER \u2014 STORM AND WEATHER SIGNALS. 7 is now used ; they are made at the harbours and semaphore stations on the coast of France, and remain hoisted 48 hours from the time of receiving notice from the Ministry of Marine. The signals are made with a cone and drum painted black, which, when hoisted, appear as a triangle and square ; thus ; \u2014 t Southerly gale. \u2014 The cone point downwards means that strong winds are probable, at first from the southward (from S.E. round by South to N.W.). i Northerly g*ale. \u2014 The cone point upwards means that Za strong winds are probable, first from the northward (from N.W. round by North to N.E.). Very heavy gales.\u2014 The drum is hoisted with the JL I cone whenever a very heavy gale, southerly or northerly as W \"\"r the case may be, is probable, (with southerly gales above the Y |p cone; with northerly gales below the Cone). The drum is not used without the cone. Sudden shifts Of Wind. \u2014 No signal is employed to indicate a wind which is likely to shift suddenly, but it must be remembered that a southerly wind is much more likely to veer to a point north ward of West, than a northerly wind is to veer to a point southward of East. Consequently, when the South cone is hoisted and a vessel is at an anchorage open to the N.W. it is well to be prepared for the gale being finally from that quarter. Meaning Of Signals. \u2014 The hoisting of any of these signals is intended as a sign that there is an atmospherical disturbance in existence which will probably cause a gale from the quarter indicated by the signal used, in the neighbourhood, say within a distance of 50 miles, of the place where the signal is hoisted, and the knowledge of which is likely to be of use to the sailors and fishermen on that part of the coast. Its meaning is simply, \" look out ! It is probable that bad weather of such and such a character is approaching you.\" WEATHER SIGNALS.\u2014 The following weather signals, in addition to the established storm warnings, have been adopted at the semaphore stations and at the principal ports and shipping places on the coasts of France : \u2014 1. A flag, of any colour, indicates \u2014 Weather doubtful, barometer in- clined to fall. 2. A short pendant (Cornet) \u201e Appearance of bad weather, heavy sea, barometer falling."], [28, "[Chap. I. 8 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 3. A pendant indicates \u2014 Appearance of better weather, barometer rising. 4. A flag above Cornet \u201e The entrance of the port has be- come dangerous. 5. A flag below Cornet \u201e The life-boat is coming out. Note. \u2014 In fine settled weather no signal is made. FRENCH TIDAL SIGNALS\u2014 The following system of tidal signals was issued in August 1855 by the French Minister of Commerce and Public Works, and is now, with some variations, used at all the ports on the coast of France. The signals are made by balls and flags hoisted on a mast, on which a yard is crossed. The balls are black. A ball hoisted at the intersection of the mast and yard denotes a least depth of 10 feet (English) throughout the channel of the harbour. Each ball hoisted on the mast beneath the first denotes an additional depth of 3\u00a3 feet. Each ball hoisted above the first denotes an additional depth of 6^ feet. Each ball hoisted at the left yard-arm, looking from seaward, denotes an additional 10 inches. Each ball hoisted at the right yard-arm denotes an additional 1 foot 8 inches. To indicate the state of the tide, a white flag with a black cross is used ; also, a black pendant. These are hoisted at the mast-head immediately there are 6^ feet in the channel and lowered when the water has receded to the same level. During the flood, the pendant is above the flag ; at high water and during the top of the tide, the pendant is hauled down ; and, during the ebb, the pendant is hoisted below the flag. When the state of the sea is such as to prevent vessels entering the port, these signals are replaced by a red flag hoisted at the mast-head. It should be remarked that the signals are not necessarily complete at all ports, but, so far as they are used, their significations are always the same. Thus, at some places the depths are shown only at every 3\u00a3 feet, in which cases balls at the yard-arms are not required. At others, the depth of 6| feet, together with the state of the tides, is indicated by the flag and pendant, a ball being hoisted below them when there are 10 feet. In this latter case the mast has no yard."], [29, "Chap. L] SIGNALS \u2014 BUOYAGE. 9 Table of Tidal Signals. RISING TIDE- HIGH WATER. FALLING TIDE Danger Signals. \u2014 The following danger signals have been estab lished on the coasts in the event of the entrance of a harbour being obstructed by a stranded vessel or by any other accident, viz. : \u2014 By day, a red flag is hoisted on one of the jetties. By night, a red light is exhibited ; and, in those harbours where a single light is already established, a second light is exhibited and both show red lights. FRENCH SYSTEM of BUOYAGE.\u2014 A uniform system of colouring all buoys and beacons is observed on the French coast. In entering a port, buoys and beacons painted red with a broad white band a little below the top must be left to starboard, and those painted black to port. Those which may be passed on either side are painted with alternate red and black horizontal bands. This distinctive colouring of beacons applies only to the portion above the level of the highest tides ; below that level, all beacons, whatever their position, are painted white; as are also all warping buoys. The colours red and black are varied as circumstances require by chequers, vertical stripes, &c, in white. The small rocky heads in the frequented channels are painted in the same manner as the beacons, but only on such a portion of their surface as to render them sufficiently conspicuous."], [30, "10 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I. Every buoy or beacon marking the sides of a channel bears either in full length, or abbreviated characters, the name of the shoal or rock which it is meant to distinguish and also its number, showing its numerical order in the channel. These numbers commence from seaward ; the even numbers on the buoys and beacons painted red with a white band, and the odd numbers on the black buoys and beacons. Those painted with red and black bands have names only, but no numbers. The letters and numbers, from ten to twelve inches in length, are painted white on the most conspicuous parts of the buoys and beacons. The masts of these beacons which do not present sufficient surface are surmounted for this purpose by a small board. All the jetty heads and beacon turrets are painted above the half-tide level, and on the former a scale of metres is marked commencing from the same level. FRENCH FOG SIGNALS.\u2014 On the coast of France, the fog signals are made either by trumpets or bells. Light-vessels invariably use the latter.* USHANT to HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. USHANT, Or ILE D'OUESSANT, lies 10 miles westward of the western extreme of the coast of France. It is about 4\u00a3 miles long W. by N. and E. by S., about 2 miles wide, and its highest part, towards the North-east, is 195 feet above the level of the sea. In fine weather, the island is visible from a distance of from 15 to 20 miles, the outline appearing rugged and uneven, and the shore composed of precipitous rocky cliffs of granite formation. (See view on Admiralty chart, No. 2694.) It is surrounded by dangers but has three bays in which small vessels find temporary shelter. There are two light houses on the island ; one at the north-eastern extreme, the other at the north-western. | The inhabitants, about 2,500 in number, are chiefly employed in rearing cattle and as fishermen ; many of the latter are well acquainted with, and can act as pilots for, the passages in the vicinity, rendered * The French Government has given notice, dated 21st May, 1887, that, at the fog signal stations on the French coast, it is not always possible to determine the existence of fog banks in the offing ; and, that nearly an hour may always elapse from the time it is considered necessary to use the fog signal until the signal is first made. Mariners are therefore cautioned that, when approaching the land in a fog. they should not rely implicitly on these fog signals, but should always use the lead, which, in nearly all cases, gives sufficient warning to avert danger. j See Admiralty Chart : \u2014 Channels between lie d'Ouessant and the mainland.

The only village on the island is Lampaul or Portspaul, situated at the head of a bay on the south-western side. In other parts the houses are scattered, forming only small hamlets. A post-boat communicates with Conquet on the mainland, at which place the produce of the island, consisting of soda, grain, sheep, and poultry is disposed of. Supplies. \u2014 Wood is scarce, but water and other supplies can be obtained in moderate quantities ; for fuel, the natives find a substitute in dried seaweed. LIGHTS. \u2014 North-west Light. \u2014 On Creac'h point, at the north western extreme of the island, is a circular tower, with black and white horizontal bands, from which is exhibited an electric, group) flashing, ivhite light, at 223 feet above high water ; the groups show every 10 seconds, each group consisting of two flashes, separated by an interval of 2-| seconds ; the interval between the groups being 1\\ seconds. The light should be visible in clear weather 21 miles, but the intensity of the flashes will enable the glare to be seen consider ably beyond that distance. North-east Light. \u2014 A conspicuous white lighthouse, 85 feet high, stands on the northern side of the Baie du Stiff, near the north eastern extreme of Ushant, from the staircase tower of which, at 267 feet above high water, is exhibited provisionally, pending the alterations now in progress in the light, a fixed white light visible 14 miles, between the bearings of S. 31\u00b0 E., through west, and N. 57\u00b0 E. This lighthouse consists of two round towers united : the illumin ating apparatus formerly used at the Creac'h point light is being trans ferred and will be the permanent apparatus for the North-east light. Fog Trumpet. \u2014 At the western point of the island, two thirds of a mile south-westward of the North-west lighthouse, is the fog signal station. From it, during foggy weather, a powerful fog trumpet is sounded every forty seconds, giving two blasts, each of three seconds1 duration, separated by an interval of two seconds. The sound may generally be heard 3 miles in calm weather (See note, page 10.) A Life-Boat is stationed at Lampaul. Semaphores. \u2014 By using the Commercial Code of Signals, passing vessels can communicate with either the semaphore on Creac'h point, or that on the N.E. point, and by this means telegraphic messages may be sent to all the countries of Europe."], [34, "12 [Chap. I. USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. Baie du Lampaul is the port of Ushant ; it is on the south western side of the island, and is exposed to the whole force of south-westerly gales. It is only used by small vessels, although the water is deep over a sandy bottom which shoals gradually towards its head, thus rendering anchors less liable to drag with a westerly wind. A high rock named the Corce, the summit of which never covers, lies in the middle of the bay. The dangers to be avoided in entering this bay are the Jument rock, a ledge named the Basse Bridy, and the Leurvas rocks. The Jument rock, which uncovers 19 feet at the lowest tides, lies W.S.W. 1^ miles from the Runiou beacon, which is near Runiou point \u2014 the southern extreme of Ushant ; from the rock, Belanger mill open a quarter of a point eastward of the Corce rock, bears N.E. \\ E. ; Basse Bridy ledge bears West 1^ miles from the Runiou beacon ; and, Leurvas rock S.W. by W. | W. a long half mile from the northern horn of the bay. Ushant North-east lighthouse kept a little open northward of the Corce rock about E. by N. leads into Lampaul bay, between Basse Bridy ledge and Leurvas rock. There is anchorage in from 12 to 7 fathoms, sandy bottom, northward of the Corce, which may be rounded close-to on all sides, but the small coasters using this port pass south ward of it and anchor near the head of the bay, southward of the Men-ar-Blanc rocks, where a mooring buoy is placed for the con venience of those weighing and requiring to run a warp out. The bay is rarely without much swell. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots reside at Lampaul, but have nothing but small open boats ; consequently, with a south-westerly wind and a flood tide it is seldom possible for them to board vessels. Should a pilot be required, it is important to attract their attention by signal, as so many outward bound vessels not requiring them pass close to the island. Chaussee de Keller.\u2014 At 2 miles N.N.E. \u00a3 E. from the western extreme of Ushant, and 3 miles N.W. by W. \\ W. from the North east lighthouse, is Basse Callet, a small patch of 11 fathoms, with from 21 to 28 fathoms close round it, forming the western extreme of the Chaussee de Keller, which is the chain or causeway of rocks extend ing N.W. by W. \\ W. 1\\ miles from the western part of Keller isle.

Baie du Stiff, on the north-eastern side of Ushant, affords tem porary anchorage for small vessels but is open to the eastward and even with westerly winds there is always a heavy swell. The dangers to be avoided on entering are, the Men-Corn, Douellan rocks, and Ligounec bank, off its southern point ; and, the Gorle-bian rock in the middle of the bay. The Men-Corn and Gorle-bian rocks uncover at half tide and are both marked by stone beacon turrets showing 6 feet above high water, springs.

CHANNELS between USHANT and the COAST.*\u2014 Nearly the whole space between Ushant and the French coast is studded with islets, rocks, and shoals, particularly in the direction of St. Mathieu point, which bears S.E. by S. 16 miles from Ushant N.W. lighthouse. A vessel is south-westward of all these dangers so long as this lighthouse is open westward of Runiou beacon bearing N. by W. There are three deep channels through these dangers, the Passage du Fromveur, Chenal du Four, and Chenal de la Helle ; the first only should be taken by a stranger, as the others are very intricate, with sunken rocks lying nearly in the fairway. The tidal streams also are very strong, running 4^ knots at springs, the flood setting to the northward. f Passage du Fromveur runs parallel with the southern coast of Ushant, along which are many rocks and rocky patches, but none extend more than half a mile from the shore. The principal danger is on the southern side of the channel, off the broken rocky isle of Loedoc, from which a rocky ledge extends W.N.W. nearly half a mile, and at its extreme is Men Tensel, a detached rock which uncovers 15 feet at the lowest tides. Most of the rocks on this ledge, however, are visible at half ebb, and there is generally' broken water over them at other times, but care must be taken to avoid a sunken rock with only 12 feet, about 1^ cables north-westward of Men Tensel.

Directions. \u2014 Bound through the Fromveur channel from the southward ; when about 2 miles South from Runiou point, steer about E.N.E. towards the Youc'h rock, lying southward of the eastern end of Ushant, and keep it well open eastward of Men-Cren, Men-ar froud, on which is a beacon turret, and of all the rocks off the southern shore. The Men-Corn beacon will open eastward of Youc'h as Men-ar-froud is passed at 3 or 4 cables distance, and it should then be kept well open to clear all dangers on the island side, observing on the other hand that when Loedoc bears southward of S.E. the ship is clear of danger on that side. Youc'h and Men-Corn should each be given a berth of 3 or 4 cables in passing, and when the N.E. lighthouse is on with Men-Corn, or lie de Bannec is opened east ward of Loedoc, a course may be steered to the north-eastward as desired. If from the North or North-eastward ; round the eastern end of Ushant about a mile distant, and, steering about W.S.W., pass within 3 or 4 cables of Men-Corn, Youc'h, and Men-ar-froud, as just de scribed. When abreast of Men-ar-foud, or when Loedoc is eastward of E.S.E., the chief danger on the southern side has been passed ; and, when the southern end of Bannec bears E. \\ N. and the western end of Ushant N. by E. \\ E., a course may be steered to clear the Saints ; or, if bound to Brest, a S. by E. \\ E. course for 10 miles, due allowance being made for tide, and an occasional bearing of the Pierres Noires lighthouse is very useful for this purpose, leads westward of the Pierres Vertes, the highest of which uncovers 7 feet at low water, springs, and also of the westernmost patch of the Pierres Noires, on which there are 13 feet at that time. A course may then be steered towards the Goulet de Brest, with the lighthouse on Petit Minou point on with the lighthouse on Portzic point bearing East. Chenal du Four. \u2014 Notwithstanding its many dangers, this channel is much used by vessels passing between Brest and the Channel ports, not only on account of the distance saved, but also from the comparatively smooth water found within it during westerly winds. Its southern entrance is about one mile S.W. of cape St. Mathieu, and the leading mark through, after the Grande Vinotiere beacon turret has been passed, is, the lighthouse on Kermorvan point on with that on St. Mathieu point, bearing S. \\ E. ; but, the naviga-"], [37, "15 Chap. I. J FOUR AND HBLLB CHANNELS. \u2014 L'ABERILDUT. tion of the southern part of the channel, from the entrance to this point, is rendered difficult by the numerous dangers, of which the chief are, the Vieux Moines and Bossemens Orientales rocks, the Basse du Chenal marked by a red buoy, and Basse des Renards by a black buoy. A course of about N. by E. leads towards the Grande Vinotiere beacon turret, between which and a rock with only 12 feet water westward of the Petite Vinotiere, and only a quarter of a mile south-eastward of the Grande Vinotiere, a vessel should pass, then hauling more eastward to bring the leading mark on, which mark must be strictly maintained to avoid the numerous shoals at the northern entrance, until the Four lighthouse bears E. by N. The St. Paul, Tendoc, and Valbelle shoals are passed close to on the starboard hand, and each is marked by a black buoy ; whilst the Basse St. Pierre, Chaussee des Pourceaux, and Platresses red buoys are left on the port hand. Chenal de la Helle lies westward of the Four channel, from which it is separated by the Platresses, a rocky ledge three quarters of a mile long North and South. The direction of this channel is about N.N.W. \u00a3 W. and S.S.E. E., and it unites with the Four channel about 2 miles northward of Kermorvan point. The COAST between Ushant and lie de Bas, 43 miles to the eastward, is moderately high and in clear weather may be seen from 15 to 18 miles off ; it is, however, fronted with rocks, some of which are nearly 3 miles in the offing and from a distance have the appearance of houses. Unless absolutely necessary, it is prudent to give this part of the coast a berth of 5 or 6 miles, especially at night when it should not be approached within a depth of from 46 to 36 fathoms ; the bottom at this depth is grey sand mixed with small pebbles, of various colours, resembling nuts. When it blows hard on a weather tide, a berth of at least 2 miles should be given to the northern coast of the ile de Bas, to avoid crossing the race or overfall produced by the uneven bottom extend ing from its northern shore. Tidal Streams. \u2014 Between Ushant and lie de Bas, the flood stream sets East and the ebb West. In the offing the flood turns about 2f hours after the time of high water at Porsal, which, at full and change, is about 4 h. 0 m.

At low water, the port dries completely out 2 cables beyond the entrance, but, the bottom being soft sand, vessels lie aground with great safety. It is much frequented by Brest pilots and fishermen from the adjoining coast ; a considerable trade is also carried on, the principal exports being stone and sand ; a great deal of the stone used in the Thames Embankment came from here. Directions. \u2014 To enter l'Aberildut ; when about 2 miles off the entrance, bring the tower of Breles church, seen amongst the trees about 2 miles inland, on with the tower of Lanildut church E. f S. ; this mark leads up to the entrance, passing about one cable northward of the Pierre de Laber rock, which uncovers 12 feet at low water and is marked by a beacon turret, and between the Trois Pierres on the North and Men-Garo rock on the South, which latter covers at equinoctial tides only. On arriving at the entrance, which is about 150 yards wide, pass about 50 yards southward of a black rock connected with the northern point of entrance by a jetty ; run on, keeping about 50 or 60 yards from the northern shore, and on rounding the point which forms the western side of the port of Laber, if having come in for shelter only, anchor when abreast of the first houses in that village ; but, if going to take in or discharge cargo, proceed on up to the quay where the grounding places are excellent, the bottom being sand and mud. The tide runs very strongly to the S.W. across the entrance during the first hour of the ebb, requiring a fresh breeze to stem it. It is advisable for a stranger to take a pilot, or, as there are none specially belonging to the port, fishermen do equally well. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in l'Aberildut at 3 h. 58 m. ; the tide rises 16 feet at ordinary springs, and 9f feet at neaps, above the grounding places off Laber, where the bottom dries about 9 feet at the lowest tides. Le FOUR is a large and remarkable black rock, broad at the top and 17 feet high, lying N.W. \\ W. about a mile from Melgorne point, the north-western extreme of the coast of France ; and, E. \\ S. 10^ miles from Ushant North-east lighthouse. LIGHT. \u2014 From a lighthouse on the Four rock, 85 feet high from base to vane, is exhibited, at 92 feet above high water, a light showing fixed white during thirty seconds, followed during the next thirty secoiuls by a group of eight distinct flashes with an eclipse between each flash ; thus the light is alternately fixed and flashing ; in clear weather, it is visible from a distance of 15 miles."], [39, "Chap. I.] ARGENTON.\u2014 PORSAL ROCKS AND PORT. 17 Fog Trumpet. \u2014 During thick or foggy weather, a steam trumpet sounds a blast of five seconds' duration, followed by an interval of silence of twenty seconds. (See note, page 10.) Argenton. \u2014 E. by S. \\ S. about 1^ miles from the Four lighthouse, is the entrance to this little harbour, which dries at low water but has a bottom of sand and mud and is completely land-locked. The only practicable channel to the entrance is between the Four rocks and the Petit Melgorne, but its approaches are so barred by dangers as to render it hazardous for even the smallest vessels to attempt except in the hands of a skilful local pilot. A rather extensive fishery exists here, and the coasting trade is carried on by about 60 small vessels calling annually. Semaphore. \u2014 One and a quarter miles northward of the entrance to Argenton is a semaphore station on point Landunvez. ROCHES de PORSAL.\u2014 The body of this entensive ledge lies 4 miles north-eastward from the Four lighthouse and 5 miles west ward from the entrance of the Abervrac'h river ; the greater part of the rocks are covered at high water. The shoal patches on the outer part of the ledge extend 2\\ miles, and the rocks that uncover, 1| miles from the coast. There is anchorage amongst, and several passages through them, but the navigation is too intricate to be attempted without a pilot. Tidal Streams. \u2014 Off the Porsal rocks, the tides turn two hours before high and low water by the shore. At springs, they set about East and West at the rate of 3 or 4 knots, and 5 knots or more near the shore, where they also turn half an hour sooner. Portsal Or Porsal. \u2014 This port, which is fronted by the rocb.es de Porsal, comprises three distinct bays ; at the head of the first stands the village of Portsal, the second is the bay iof Kersaint, and the third that of Tremazan, or du Chateau. The harbour is dry through out its whole extent by three quarters ebb, and vessels of 13 feet draught can enter only at spring tides ; the bottom is generally of sand, but a mass of rocks which cover only at high tides occupy the middle of the harbour. In bad weather, the swell and surf within the port are so great as to render it dangerous. There are no wharfs approachable by vessels, and loading or discharging is done by boats when the tide suits. Notwithstanding all its disadvantages, the vicinity of the large town of Ploudalmezeau causes a considerable and growing trade, 60 or 80 vessels unloading annually ; it has also an extensive fishery. A 2771. Wt. 7242, B"], [40, "18 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I. Several channels lead to Portsal but all are intricate and none should be attempted without a pilot. The leading mark for the South or inner channel is, lurch rock just closed in by Men Gouziane E.N.E. ; both of these rocks are marked by beacons. From the North-west, the leading mark through the reefs to the inner channel is lurch rock on with Ploudalmezeau spire. Life-Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Portsal. CAUTION.\u2014 The coast in the vicinity of Porsal and Four rocks is of moderate height, but being bordered by numerous dangers it should not be approached at night or in thick weather within the depth of 45 fathoms ; the bottom at that depth is generally of grey sand mixed with flint and other stones. L'Aberbenoit. \u2014 Between Portsal and l'Abervrac'h is a deep bight encumbered by rocks and shoals, into which the river Aber benoit flows, forming a harbour of but little importance, but approached by a deep entrance channel on either side of the plateau de Rusven, a reef which dries in places at low water. The eastern passage is the broadest and deepest, but, with westerly winds, the western passage is preferred, as it gives more room to clear the broken water caused by the lie Guennoc. L'ABERVRAC'H. \u2014 The entrance to this river, nearly 6 miles eastward of Portsal and 4 miles westward of Correjou bay, is difficult of access, being much encumbered by numerous shoals, islets, and rocks. It, however, affords good shelter to wind-bound ships ; the outer roadstead is just within the entrance and about 1^ cables south eastward of the beacon on the Petit Pot-de-Beurre rock ; it has from 6 to 8 fathoms water over a sandy bottom. The inner road is 1^ miles in a S.S.E. \u00a3 E. direction from the outer road, and the least depth is 5 fathoms, except 1\u00a3 cables north-eastward of Cezon isle, where there are only 2\\ fathoms. The whole space between the outer and inner roads affords good anchorage to vessels of the largest size. The roads are separated from the port by a mole about 260 yards in length, where vessels discharge cargo and where water may be obtained. There are also two beaching places on the left bank of the river, one in Anges bay, the other a little farther eastward in St. Antoine bay ; the bottom in both bays is soft mud and dries 6^ feet above the lowest tides. Great expense has been incurred in the beacons, lights, and buoyage of this harbour, but since the increase of steam navigation its trade steadily declines, though a large number of boats are engaged in the fisheries."], [41, "Chap. I.] l' abervrac'h, 19 LIGHTS. \u2014 The entrance to Abervrac'h river is facilitated at night by the following lights : A fixed red light shown on the eastern side of the entrance from a white square tower, 36 feet high, erected on the southern part of Vrac'h ile. This light is 59 feet above high water, and in clear weather is visible from a distance of 6 miles. A. fixed white light from a white square tower on Lanvaon heights, which bears S.E. by E. \\ E. If miles from the tower on Vrac'h ile. This light is 171 feet above high water, is visible through an arc of 36\u00b0 from a distance of 14 miles, and when in line with the light on Vrac'h ile leads through the Grand chenal to the entrance of the Abervac'h. Two fixed lights are also exhibited on the left or western bank of the river, one white, at the head of St. Antoine creek ; the other green, on the eastern point of Palue beach ; when in line, they show the direction of the inner anchorage. These*lights, elevated respec tively 49 and 29 feet above high water, are visible 11 and 8 miles. Life-Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Vrac'h ile. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 The Abervrac'h river can be entered by three channels, all of which are accessible to the heaviest ships at high water, and one, the Grand chenal, is available at any time of tide ; it leads in from the westward passing southward of Libenter ledge. The Chenal de la Malouine leads in from the northward between Malouine and Pendante ledges. The third is the Pendante channel between Libenter ledge and the Pendante ; its navigation is difficult, and should not be attempted without a pilot. The Grand Chenal is practicable for vessels of the deepest draught with a fair wind, and wide enough for coasters to turn through. In approaching it from the westward, as soon as they are seen, bring the steeple of Plouguerneau church and the white light towers on Vrac'h ile and on Lanvaon heights in line,, or, at night, the white and red lights in line bearing S.E. by E. \\ E., which is the leading mark in ; but, when coming from the northward, the steeple of Ploudalmezeau church must be kept well open westward of the steeple of Lampaul church S.S.W. until the leading mark is on, in order to pass westward of the western patches of Libenter ledge ; there are never less than 25 feet on these patches, but a heavy sea runs over them in bad weather. In running through this channel, the leading mark must be kept exactly on, for although the vessel passes 1\\ cables southward of the south extreme of Libenter ledge, which is marked by a black buoy B 2"], [42, "20 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I. and about the same distance southward of the Grand Pot-de-Buerre ledge, yet it leads only a little northward of a 9^-feet patch, named the Basse du Chenal, and 80 yards southward of the beacon on the Petit Pot-de-Buerre, which at night may not be seen. Having passed this beacon, the vessel may either come-to in the outer anchorage, or proceed southward with the light tower in St. Antoine bay on with that on Palue beach ; or, at night, with the white and green lights in line S.E. by S. This being the line of direction for the inner anchorage a berth may be taken as convenient, mooring N.W. and S.E. ; or, if capable of taking the ground, the vessel can steer for one of the beaching places. The Malouine Channel is about 120 yards wide at the narrowest part and can only be used with a leading wind. The beacon turret on the Petit Pot-de-Beurre exactly on with that on the Petite lie de la Croix S. by W. \u00a3 W. leads through in not less than 20 feet ; the beacon on the Petit Pot-de-Beurre should be passed close to on the starboard hand, when the vessels may anchor in the outer roads or proceed to the inner anchorage as before directed. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the river Abervrac'h at 4h. 14m. ; equinoctial springs rise 29 feet, ordinary springs 22 feet, ordinary neaps 16 feet, and neaps range 10 feet. A He Vierge is a mass of rocks but little?above the level of the sea and without any vegetation ; between it and the shore is a passage used by coasters and small craft only, and also the little bay of Portz- Malo where they anchor close to the shore and ground as the tide falls. lie Vierge lies 2 miles eastward of the entrance to the river Abervrac'h, and N.W. by W. \\ W. 2\u00a3 miles from the western point of Correjou bay; it may be recognised from some distance by the square lighthouse erected 109 yards from its eastern extreme. ILE VIERGE LIGHT.\u2014 The lighthouse exhibits, at 108 feet above high water, a fixed white light varied every four minutes by a red flash, preceded and followed by a short eclipse. The light, which is of the third order, is an excellent guide for the entrance to Abervrac'h and also for Correjou bay ; it is visible in clear weather from a distance of 17 miles ; the eclipses do not appear total within the distance of 6 miles. From ile Vierge, the lighthouse on Bec-pol, Pontusval, bears E. \\ S. nearly 9 miles ; the shoals fronting this part of the coast, of which the principal are the Plateau du Lizen-Ven, Plateau du Guern, Plateau d'Aman-ar-Ross, and the Basses St. Tregarec, extend li"], [43, "Chap. I.] Ile vierge. \u2014 correjou bay. 21 miles seaward of this line and the coast recedes nearly 2 miles. In coming from the westward, a vessel will clear all these shoals by keeping the tower of Ploudalmezeau church well open westward of ile Vierge until the lighthouse on Bec-pol bears S.E. by E. CORREJOU BAY.\u2014 In the western part of the bight named, is Correjou Bay ; Penenes isle lies in its northern part, and close north-eastward of the isle is Penvers ledge, which covers at high water with the\" exception of three heads, one at its southern, the second at its eastern, and the third at its northern extreme. A short distance eastward of the eastern head is the north-western end of the Bazughen ledge, which from thence trends a quarter of a mile in a south-easterly direction, its highest head uncovering 10 feet at the lowest tides. The Garrec-Crom ledge, northward of the Bazughen, covers at high water with the exception of one head at its eastern extreme. The anchorage in this bay is south-eastward of Penvers ledge, and the depth is from 13 to 19 feet at low water, springs. The beaching place is southward of Penenes isle ; the bottom here is of sand, and it rises gradually towards the coast, at the foot of which it dries 16 feet above the lowest tides. Directions. \u2014 Correjou bay may be entered by two channels, the Western and Eastern channels ; the Western channel is between the coast and the southern part of the Lizen-Ven ledge ; the Eastern channel is between the Guern ledge and a ledge named the Chaussee de Carrec-Hir. To enter by the western channel, steer to the southward with the lighthouse on Vierge isle on a S. by W. bearing until the guard-house of Kerisoc is on with the northern head on Penvers ledge S.E. \\ E. Proceed with this mark on until half way between this rock and the Andolven rocks, when ile Vierge lighthouse seen over a remarkable gap or cleft in the Andolven rocks, just to the left of the most northern rock, becomes the mark, and, passing northward of Penvers ledge, leads between Garrec-Crom and the Bazughen, and about 22 yards northward of a 4-feet patch nearly in mid-channel. Vessels may ancher in about 16 feet, sand, with this mark on, when Penven and Mean-Yan are in line. Do not haul more to the south ward for an anchorage before the highest head on the Garrec-Crom is northward of N.N.E., for the south-eastern head of the Bazughen bears S.S.W. from this head ; and, in steering to the southward, the highest head of the Garrec-Crom must not be brought more easterly than N. by E. \\ E. so long as the southern head on Penvers ledge is"], [44, "[Chap. I. 22 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. shut in southward of the North point of the bay. The swell is much felt in this bay above half tide, and, as no marks can be given for leaving it at night, it should only be used in the finest weather. The leading mark through the eastern channel is the steeple of Plouguerneau church on with the Mean-Yan rock bearing S.S.W. \\ W. ; this rock is on the south-eastern edge of the Guern ledge and uncovers 23 feet. The mark leads in not less than 7 fathoms until the vessel is about 1^ cables from the Mean-Yan, when steer a little to port to pass eastward of it. After clearing the south-eastern edge of the ledge, bring Plouguerneau church steeple to bear as before, and it will lead close westward of the Garrec-Crom, when proceed as before directed. Semaphore. \u2014 About a mile eastward of the anchorage in Correjou bay is a semaphore station on pointe de Kerisoc. Between the Baie de Correjou and Pontusval are the small tidal harbours of Treisseny and Kerlouan, of little or no importance. LIGHT. \u2014 On Bec-pol, Pontusval point, stands a square lighthouse, from whence, at 59 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed white light, with a red sector between the bearings S.E. by E. f E. and E. by N. % N. showing over the Basses St. Tregarec and the shoals westward, but which does not cover all the shoal ground when approached within 2 miles. The light is visible from a distance of 12 miles. PONTUSVAL, the entrance to which port is about one mile eastward of the lighthouse on Bec-pol and 1\u00a3 miles north-westward of the Greve de Goulven, is the only place on this part of the coast where the crew of a vessel, driven on a lee shore, could hope to be saved. It berths a large number of coasters, but the bottom is hard, and, in strong gales from the northward, it is not an unfrequent occurrence to see them wrecked at their anchors. The port completely dries out at low water as far as abreast of the western entrance point, and, from thence, the bottom gradually rises to the head of the port. A vessel is moderately well sheltered on the eastern side of the port in a little bay named La Chambre, in which the bottom dries 13^ feet above the lowest tides. The least depth in the entrance channel, until abreast of the western entrance point, is 13 feet; but, as the channel is bordered on both sides by sunken rocks and crossed obliquely by the tidal streams, it is not safe to enter without a pilot, and then only with a fair wind. Telegraph Cable.\u2014 The telegraph cable from Salcombe is landed at this port."], [45, "Chap. I.] 23 PONTUSVAL. \u2014 ANSE DE KERNIC. A Life-Boat is stationed at this port. Directions. \u2014 To enter Pontusval ; when about half a mile from the entrance, steer to the southward with the beacon on the eastern shore of the port, eastward of the Custom-house office, exactly on with the steeple of Plouneour church S. by W. W. This mark leads between the two rocks Blanche de l'entree and Ar-Neuden, only one third of a cable apart ; the former is on the western side of the entrance and its summit is always above water ; the latter, which has on it a beacon turret painted black with a short staff and ball, and 8 feet above the level of the highest tides, is on the eastern side and uncovers 12^ feet. When abreast of the Blanche de l'entree, steer a little more to starboard, to pass nearly midway between the Blanche du centre and Vran rocks ; the former lies on the western side of the channel and never covers, the latter on the eastern side and uncovers 27 feet. Pass rather nearer the Blanche than the Vran, and when near the Blanche du dedans, a rock one cable south-westward of Blanche du centre, steer for the Custom-house office on a S. by W. \\ W. bearing and it will lead into La Chambre, on the eastern side of the port. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port Pontusval at 4h. 25m., and the tide rises in La Chambre about 16^ feet at equi noctial springs, and 5 feet at neaps ; here the bottom dries 13j feet above the level of the lowest tides. The COAST. \u2014 From the lighthouse on Bec-pol, Pontusval, ile de Bas lighthouse bears E. |- S. 13J miles ; between the two are the Greve de Goulven, Anse de Kernic, Port Nevez, and other small bays and creeks, places of little or no importance, and so incumbered by rocks and shoals as to be very dangerous to approach. The most outlying shoal in the neighbourhood is Queyn Cos, with 3rj fathoms, its outer extreme is 2\u00a7 miles from the nearest land, and E. N. 4\u00a3 miles from Pontusval light. Greve de Goulven. \u2014 This deep sandy bay affords shelter from westerly winds to vessels that can take the ground, but it is difficult of access, its entrance being full of rocks. ANSE de KERNIC, or, as it is sometimes called, the port de Plouescat, has a narrow entrance choked by rocks awash ; it has a sandy bottom which dries at half tide, but, at high water, springs, there are from 6 to 15 feet ; it is reported to be gradually silting up, and much land has been reclaimed from the sea on its borders. It is used only by vessels of from 60 to 80 tons, but having neither quay nor wharf, they discharge cargo into carts alongside when left by the tide."], [46, "[Chap. 1. 24 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. lie de Siec\u2014 This islet, lying between port Nevez and Ile de Bas, from the western extreme of which its western rock, Golc'hedec, bears S.W. \\ W. 2| miles, is half a mile long E.S.E. and W.N.W. and is connected with the land by a rocky ledge which uncovers at low water, thus affording shelter to an excellent anchorage completely out of the tide ; it is much frequented by coasting vessels, with the wind from N.E. round by East to S.S.E. Approaching the anchorage from the westward, bring the spire of St. Pol-de-Leon college on with the Querelevran rock, which lies one cable southward of the western point of the isle, and anchor in from 5 to 6 fathoms, sand, when Golc'hedec rock, 2 cables north westward of the isle, bears N.N.E. 3 or 4 cables distant. Coming from the northward, bring the tower of Cleder church on with the eastern point of the entrance to port Nevez S.W. by S. ; this line passes 3 cables westward of Golc'hedec rock, but within 2 cables of the Calhic rock, which lies half a mile N.N.E. from the Golc'hedec and dries 18 feet at low water ; when the leading marks given before come on, steer in for the anchorage. ILE de BAS, or ile de Batz as it is frequently called, is a low Island not visible from the deck of a vessel at a greater distance than 9 miles, though the lighthouse near its western end may be seen much farther ; it lies immediately off the promontory of Roscoff, and when bearing S.S.W. becomes blended with the coast, from which it is only separated by a channel less than 7 cables wide at its narrowest part. It is about 2 miles long E.S.E. and W.N.W., and one mile wide ; it is bordered on its western, northern, and eastern sides by rocks and shoals extending from half a mile to a mile from the shore, one of the most prominent of which is the Penven, always above water, 4 cables northward from the central northern point of the isle, but most of the rocks cover at high water. From ile de Bas lighthouse, Pontusval light bears W. \\ N. 13 J miles, and Triagoz light E. | N. 16\u00a3 miles.* LIGHT. \u2014 The circular lighthouse erected on a mound half a mile from the western end of the ile de Bas, exhibits a revolving ivhite light of the first order, which attains its greatest brilliancy every minute. The light is 223 feet above high water, and is visible in clear weather from- a distance of 22 miles ; in ordinary weather, the eclipses do not appear total within the distance of 12 miles. Semaphore.\u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the ile de Bas. * See Admiralty chart : Ile de Bas and adjacent islands, No. 2,745 ; scale, m = 5 \u2022 nches."], [47, "Chap. I.] iLE DE BAS \u2014 CHANNEL BETWEEN IT AND COAST. 25 The island has a population of about 1200, and on its southern side is the village and harbour of Porz Kernoch. The harbour is formed on its western side by a mole 570 yards in length connecting the shore with the Mai voch rock, marked on its south-eastern edge by a beacon; and, on its eastern side, by a short jetty connecting that shore with the ile aux Moutons. The harbour dries at low water, has 6 feet at half tide, and 19 feet at high water, springs ; it is but little used now, the coasting trade decreasing with the growth of steam navigation and improved means of land transport. A Life-Boat is stationed at the western end of the ile de Bas. CHANNEL between ILE de BAS and the COAST.\u2014 On account of its difficult navigation, this narrow channel is not much frequented except by vessels of light draught calling at Porz Kernoch or Roscoff. Vessels drawing about 19 feet may, however, if necessary, run through it with a fair wind at high water, slack. Anchorage. \u2014 The anchoring ground in this channel is comprised between the meridians of the chapel of Notre Dame de Bon Secours and the village of Porz Kernoch, and the depth is from 2 to 4^ fathoms. There is a long and narrow swashway with from 11 to 15 feet between the northern edge of the Traverse, a shallow shifting sand bank which bounds the anchorage eastward, and the sand-bank bordering the southern side of the isle ; and, although the stream here runs with great strength, coasters prefer it to the anchorage just described, as they are well sheltered, and, if necessary, can beach on the sands in Porz Kernoch, where the bottom dries only 6 or 7 feet at the lowest tides. Directions. \u2014 When bound through the channel between ile de Bas and the coast from the westward, Ste. Barbe western obelisk on with the white patch on the Loup rock S.E. f E. easterly, leads north ward of the Lavandieres rocks, which never cover, in not less than 5 fathoms towards the red beacon on the Oignon rock, which uncovers 22 feet and must be left to the southward. When about a cable west ward of this rock, or when the eastern mill on ile de Bas and the little pyramid beacon on Kernoch isle (seen over the mole) are in line, steer E.S.E. for the anchorage, leaving the red beacon on the Tehi bihan rock also on the starboard hand ; or, if not going to anchor, steer for point Pen-ar-Chleguer until the western mill (westward of Kernoch village) is on with Kernoch pyramid beacon ; this leads between Pen-ar-Chleguer point and Per Roc'h, marked by a black beacon turret, it also leads southward of the beacons of An-Oan and"], [48, "26 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I. of Duslen, the latter requiring a berth of at least 75 yards in passing to avoid a rock which dries at half tide distant 55 yards from it. When clear of this rock, the Duslen and Per Roc'h beacons in line lead out of the eastern entrance, passing from 20 to 30 yards only southward of the rock Ar-Chaden, which dries 15 feet at low water and forms the southern extreme of ile Pighet, on which is a beacon turret. Approaching the channel from the eastward, ile Pighet beacon turret on with the eastern mill leads to the entrance, and, as ile Pighet is neared, the leading mark already given will come on and the marks used from the westward will serve successively from the eastward ; but, it should be remembered, that to navigate this channel at any time the services of a pilot are indispensable. There is an anchorage of small extent within ile Pighet, over a bottom of gravel and broken shells, where a vessel can wait for a favourable moment either to run through the channel or to enter port Roscoff. ROSCOFF\u2014 This little tidal harbour is about a mile S.S.E. from the south-eastern extreme of ile de Bas ; it is formed by a mole or breakwater of solid construction extending with an outward curve from the western shore a distance of 575 yards. Works are also constructed at Penar-Vil, on the opposite side, to break the force of the sea during north-easterly gales ; in bad weather, however, the swell within the harbour is so great as to cause incon venience and even danger. The town has a population of about 2000, and a thriving trade is carried on by vessels up to 200 tons, both English and French ; fruit, vegetables, fish, &c, are the chief exports. The grounding places within the harbour dry from 12 to 19 feet at the lowest tides ; the breakwater affords the only quay accommodation. LIGHTS.\u2014 A fixed ivhite light, 22 feet above high water, visible 7 miles, is exhibited from an iron standard on the extreme end of the mole. A. fixed red light, 38 feet above high water, visible 8 miles, is shown on the south-western shore of the harbour. The two lights in line is the leading mark into the harbour by the northern channel. Directions. \u2014 Roscoff has several intricate approaches for fishing craft ; two channels only are available for vessels of from 150 to 200 tons, viz., that from ;he eastward, and that from the direction of the anchc:T,^e within ile Pighet ; for which latter, the leading mark by day is, the white spot on the magazine at the head of the harbour"], [49, "Chap.

This channel is difficult to navigate even at high water, and impracticable on the ebb. Life-Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Roscoff Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port Roscoff at 4 h. 49 m. The tide rises at the anchorage in the eastern part of the channel between this port and ile de Bas, 30 feet at equinoctial springs, 23 feet at ordinary springs, and 17 feet at ordinary neaps. Neaps range about 11 feet. The Coast. \u2014 From Pointe de Bloscon, the eastern entrance point of Roscoff harbour, to the northern point of Grande Ile, which lies S. by E. | E. 4^ miles from Triagoz lighthouse and is itself sur rounded by other numerous isles and rocks, the bearing and distance is E. \u00a3 S. 15|- miles, nearly the whole of the dangerous plateau de la Meloine lying seaward of this line. Between these points, the coast recedes and forms two deep bays, the shores of which are fringed by numerous rocks, many of them upwards of 1\\ miles from the land. The bays are separated from each other by Primel point, westward of which is Morlaix bay, with the entrances to the rivers Morlaix and Penze or St. Pol-de-Leon at its head ; and, eastward, the little harbour of Locquirec and the river Lannion. There is good anchorage in Morlaix road for vessels of the deepest draught, and also in the eastern bay off the mouth of the river Lannion.

The western extreme of the ledge is called the Trepieds, of which the highest rock uncovers 9 feet ; the marks for it are, the steeple of Plougaznou church on with Carrec-an-Ti rock S. \\ E. ; and, the two spires of St. Pol-de-Leon church on with the Bisayers rock W. by S. \\ S. At the eastern extreme of the plateau is the Carrec-an-Hir with 10 feet water only, and one mile westward of it is the Pongaro reef, awash at the lowest tides. In the centre of the plateau is a group of large rocks always uncovered. Buoy.\u2014 A black buoy is moored off the western extreme of the Trepieds. Clearing marks.\u2014 After passing lie de Bas, the plateau de la Meloine may be cleared on its north-western side by bearings of ile de Bas lighthouse. Coming from the eastward, by bearings of Triagoz lighthouse ; or, if in-shore, the Corbeau rock on with la Clarte church tower E. by S. \\ S., leads f of a mile northward of the Carrec-an-Hir and Pongaro ledges. There is a passage in-shore of the Meloine, between it and the Chaises de Primel, the rocky ledge extending 2\\ miles eastward from Primel point, for which the leading mark is, the clock tower of Creiskar, St. Pol-de-Leon, on with the northern side of Vezoul ile W. \\ S. This channel should never be taken except by day. St. Pol-de-Leon or Penze River, has its entrance on the western side of Morlaix bay ; 2^ miles southward of Roscoff is the town of St. Pol-de-Leon, easily distinguished by the two lofty spires of its cathedral ; adjoining is the little tidal harbour of Penpoull, between which and the ile de Callot, 1| miles distant, is the channel of the river St. Pol-de-Leon, crossed by a bridge at the village of Penze, up to which point it is navigable for coasters. Vessels bound either to Penpoull or Penze, after passing Tisaoson ile at 2 or 3 cables distance, should steer to the southward, not coming westward of S. by W. \\ W. until the turret on Benven ile and that on the northern end of ile de Callot are in line bearing S.S.E. \\ E., which mark leads between the Guerheon rock, on which is a turret, on the West, and the Cordonnier rock, awash at low water, on the East, in not less than 2 fathoms ; and, when St. Sebastian tower, the second tower southward of Ste.

MORLAIX RIVER. \u2014 The entrance to Morlaix river is on the eastern side of Morlaix bay, between the ile de Callot and"], [51, "Chap. I.] ST. POL-DE LEON.\u2014 MORLAIX. 29 Primel point. Two principal channels lead into it, the eastern or Chenal de Treguier, and the western or Grand Chenal ; the former, although not so deep as the latter, is generally preferred by coasters as its width admits of tacking. The channels unite between the isles Louet and Noire, which are half a mile apart, from whence the single channel takes a S. \\ E. direction for 3 miles to the spot where it is joined by the little river Dourdu. Above this are quays on either side where vessels may lie aground, and a small gridiron, and still higher is the lock entrance to the wet dock or basin, nearly a mile in length, with a width of from 82 to 193 feet, and a depth of from 8f feet at the upper to 16f feet at the lower end. The dimen sions of the lock are much more than equal to the requirements of the basin. At the head of the basin is the town of Morlaix, with a population of about 16,000, and a railway station on the line connecting Rennes with Brest. The railway here crosses the river on a granite viaduct on 14 arches ; it is 973 feet in length and 183 feet above the level of the quays. The trade of the port is not large and decreases ; it is carried on by vessels averaging 70 or 80 tons, about 400 entering the port annually. A few small steamers also use the port, and vessels of large size the roadstead.* LIGHTS. \u2014 To enable vessels to enter Morlaix river at night, three lights are exhibited ; one from Noire islet, lying just within the entrance of the river, 4 cables south-eastward of Chateau du Taureau isle and half way between it and point Barnenez ; another from Louet isle If cables from point Pen Lann ; and, the third from Lande tower on the left or western bank of the river. Noire isle light is a fixed white light, varied every two minutes by a bright flash, preceded and followed by a short eclipse ; it is 46 feet above high water, and visible from a distance of 12 miles. Louet isle light is 52 feet above high water, fixed white, and visible 9 miles. Lande light tower exhibits, at 285 feet above high water, a fixed white light, visible in clear weather 15 miles. Louet isle light on with Lande light tower S. by W. \u00a3 W. westerly leads up to the Grand Chenal, but passes eastward of ile Ricard. Noire isle light on with Lande tower light S.S.W. \\ W. leads through the Treguier channel. *See Admiralty chart, channels and road of Morlaix, No. 2,744 ; scale, m 5 inches."], [52, "30 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I- Besides these three lights, a small fixed red light is shown from the southern side of Chateau du Taureau isle, over the northern part of Morlaix road. Fog Signal. \u2014 In foggy weather, a bell is sounded from Noire isle every quarter of an hour for a space of two minutes. When this bell is heard at Chateau du Taureau isle, the bell at that isle is also sounded. (See note, page 10.) Approaching Morlaix, or whilst waiting for a pilot, it is useful to know that with the whole of ile de Bas open northward of Tisaoson, a double-headed rocky islet three quarters of a mile from the eastern end of the ile de Bas, a vessel is northward of all the shoals in the mouth of the bay. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Entering by the Grand Chenal into Morlaix river, steer towards the eastern end of ile de Bas until Tisaoson isle is seen. Having passed between the beacon turret on Astan rock and the black buoy off the Trepieds, 4^ miles apart ; with Tisaoson bearing W. by N. about 3 miles, and the beacon turret on the Duon rocks W.S.W. about 1^ miles, the vessel will be at the entrance of the channel and more than half a mile N.E. E. from the Basse N.E. du Pot-de-Fer, a 4-feet patch marked by a red buoy E. | N. 2^ cables from the Pot-de-Fer rock which uncovers 7 feet at the lowest tides. From this rock, Louet isle lighthouse is just open westward of Ricard isle S. 5 W. ; and, the beacon turret of the Duon rocks is on with the chapel midway between St. Pol-de- Leon and Roscoff. Lande light tower on with Louet isle lighthouse S. by W. \\ W. westerly leads through the Grand chenal eastward of the Pot-de-Fer and Duon rocks, and between the Vielle rock which dries 23 feet and is marked by a red beacon turret, and the Stolvezen, a 1-foot patch marked by a black buoy on its northern edge. Vessels of light draught with a fair wind, or steamers with a proper rise of tide according to their draught, may continue with this leading mark on until abreast of the Calhic rock turret, passing eastward of Ricard isle and close to the beacon off its north-eastern end, as well as to that on the Marlouine rock which dries 4 feet at low water, springs. This is the narrowest part of the channel, as, only one third of a cable from the Marlouine rock, a small plateau of rocks on the opposite side is awash at low water. Before entering the narrows at Ricard ile, the Roche d'Equinoxe, with 1\\ fathoms, lies exactly on the line of the leading mark ; it is easily avoided by opening the Lande light-tower westward of Louet isle lighthouse until past it."], [53, "Chap. I.] 31 MORLAIX. When abreast of the beacon on Calhic rock, steer about South to pass between the beacon on the Corbeau rock and that on the western part of the ledge extending from the northern end of Chateau du Taureau islet, and then S. E. past Louet isle and the red buoy marking the north-eastern edge of the Barre de slot ledge. When southward of Louet isle and clear of the Barre de slot, anchor as convenient in Morlaix road. Vessels of deep draught should pass westward of Ricard isle ; for which purpose, when abreast of Vezoul isle, they should quit the line of Louet and Lande light towers in line, and bring the Pierre de Carentec (white) on with the white gable of Kergrist farmhouse S.S.W. j W. westerly ; this leads between the Petit-Ricard and Noire rocks, both of which have beacons on them, and passes half a cable eastward of Fourche and Courgik beacons. When near the latter rock, which uncovers 14 feet, steer to bring the Paradis white beacon turret on with that of l'Enfer or Trepied Jaune S.S.E., which leads between the foul ground south-westward of Ricard isle and the Bezinnennou beacon up to the . Calhic rock, from whence the directions already given lead to Morlaix road. Caution. \u2014 Both the Calhic and Corbeau rocks extend a consider able distance from their beacon turrets into the channel, and great care is required in passing them. From the direction of the ile de Bas, the Grand chenal may be entered by passing southward of the Duon rocks ; for which the leading mark is, ile Pighet beacon turret on with the Moulin de l'Est, ile de Bas, N.W. This line passes close north-eastward of the Menk, Bisayers, Cochons noirs, and Vielle shoals, and leads up to the leading mark for the Grand chenal. Treguier Channel. \u2014 Vessels intending to enter by this channel must ascertain that the tide has risen sufficiently to enable them to pass over the shallow flat, nearly awash at the lowest tides, lying in the narrows of the channel, and a mile in extent north-eastward and south-westward of Blanche isle. If coming either from the west ward or eastward outside all the shoals, bring Lande light tower on with Noire isle lighthouse S.S.W. h W. as soon as they are seen ; this leads half a mile westward of the black buoy on the Trepieds ledge ; eastward of the Pierre Noire, Tourghi, Grand Areman, and Chambre rocks, all marked by beacons ; and, westward of the Jaune, Cadou, Vielle Chambre, and Plate rocks, and also of the beacons on Petit Aremen, Menheur, and Blanche isle. The Pierre Noire dries 5i feet, Tourghi 13 feet, Grand Aremen 13 feet, and Chambre 5^ feet ;"], [54, "32 [Chap. I. USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. Cadou 12\u00a3 feet, Vielle Chambre 1\u00a3 feet, Petit Aremen 8 feet, and Menheur 13 feet. When abreast of the beacon on Blanche isle, steer W.S.W. until the western part of Ricard isle touches the eastern part of Chateau du Taureau isle S. \u00a3 E. easterly, which is the line of direction for Morlaix road and also for the channel of the river. Entering by this channel at night, bring Lande fixed ivhite light on with Noire isle fixed and flashing ivhite light S.S.W. \\ W., to clear the reefs as before directed. Follow this line until the red light on the southern face of the Chateau du Taureau bears West, then steer towards it, keeping it on the starboard bow until it bears North, when the vessel will be in Morlaix road and may anchor as convenient. When near the Jaunes rock in the Treguier channel, or the Fourche beacon in the Grand chenal, vessels may, if necessary, change from one channel to the other, the leading mark for this purpose being, the beacon turret on ile de Callot open southward of the Colombier rock. Pilots. \u2014 Though the channels leading to Morlaix road and river are well marked by buoys, beacons, and lights, they are so narrow and intricate that a stranger should always take a pilot. Tides.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, .in Morlaix road at 4 h. 53 m. ; equinoctial springs rise about 31 feet ; ordinary springs 24 feet ; ordinary neaps 18 feet, and neaps range 12 feet. Tidal Signals, see page 8, should be made from Noire isle light house, but they are not attended to with regularity. It is better to trust to the indications afforded by the height of the water on the various rocks ; for instance, when the Cadou rock covers there are 17 feet in the Treguier channel. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the high land, about one mile southward of Primel point and on the eastern side of Primel harbour. Anse de Primel.\u2014 When leaving Morlaix river for Lannion road, 10 miles E. by S. from Primel point, a vessel will pass the little harbour of Primel lying just westward of the point ; it has a very narrow entrance, vessels passing close to the Zamegues rock 38 feet above low water, and still closer to the red beacon on the Raoul rock where is the narrowest part and within which is a small anchorage where vessels of considerable draught may lie afloat at all times but the holding ground is very bad, and the few small craft which use this harbour usually ground on sandy bottom higher up the bay"], [55, "Chap. I.] 33 MORLAIX. \u2014 PRIMEL. \u2014 COAST. \u2014 LANNION. Strong northerly winds cause much swell within the harbour, and, at such times, the entrance is frequently closed by breakers. Vessels bound for Lannion road may pass northward of the Chaises de Primel rocks by the marks given at page 28, and when these rocks bear S.S.W. they may steer about E.S.E. to pass a cable southward of the Taureau rock which lies in front of Lannion roads and uncovers 28 feet at the lowest tides. The steeple of Guiodel church, on the left bank of the river Lannion, a little open north ward of the guard-house on Serves point, the northern point of the river entrance, or, by night, keeping within the white sector of Begleguer light, leads to the anchorage in the roads, which is exposed to the westward, but well sheltered from North round by East and South to S.W. The Coast between Primel point and the Lannion river is foul and bordered with dangers. S.E. by E. \\ E. 7 miles from Primel point is Locquirec, a little tidal harbour formed by partially enclosing a small bay on the eastern side of the promontory of that name by throwing out a stone pier about 130 yards in a south-westerly direction ; it affords indifferent shelter to a few small craft. Toul an-Hery, also an inconsiderable port, lies at the bottom of the sandy bay adjoining Locquirec, where the little river Douron falls into the sea. Toul-an-Hery affords better shelter than Locquirec, but it is more difficult of access. South-eastward from Locquirec point is pointe de Plestin with another deep sandy bay beyond ; and, N.E. \\ N. 3i miles from Locquirec point is the Taureau rock off the bay of Lannion. The Farou and Felestrec, two dangerous rocks uncovering from 4 to 6 feet at low water, springs, lie between Locquirec and Lannion bay ; Lesangar mill on with point Landevelin leads westward of them and up to the entrance of Lannion river. Lannion roads and port. \u2014 The dangers in approaching Lannion are numerous but well marked. On the northern side the Crapeaud rock, 3\u00a3 miles north-westward from point Bihit, dries 13 feet at low water, springs, and has a beacon turret, as has also the Four rock which dries 12 feet ; and, a black conical buoy is moored westward of the f-fathom patch lying westward of the Crapeaud beacon turret ; the Taureau reef uncovers 28 feet. On the southern side is the red turret on the Kinierbel rock. The anchorage in the roads is in from 7 to 3^ fathoms. The entrance to the river, named the Guer or Leguer, is between the points Dourvin and Servet ; it is fronted by a bar which dries at low water from 3 to 5 feet. The town of Lannion, with a population of about 6,000, is 3^ miles from the A 2771. Wt. 7242. C"], [56, "34 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. L entrance in a direct line and nearly double that distance following the sinuosities of the river, which is 160 yards wide at Lannion, and has entensive quays on either side considering its very limited trade. Vessels of 8 feet draught can enter the river at half flood, but its stream as high as Lannion is occasionally subject to the phenomenon known as the bore; this takes place only when strong south-westerly winds are veering to N.W., and always on the ebb ; the bore then comes up the river sometimes twice or thrice in one tide, and with sufficient violence to capsize small boats. LIGHT.\u2014 On Begleguer point, half a mile northward of the entrance to the river, from the western face of the keeper's house, is exhibited at 161 feet above high water and through an arc of 125\u00b0, a fixed light with green, ivhite, and red sectors, visible respectively 7, 13, and 9 miles. The green sector covers 80\u00b0, from N.N.E. easterly to E. by S. i S. The white sector covers 31^\u00b0, from E. by S. \\ S. to S.E. by E. E. easterly. The red sector covers 31^\u00b0, from S.E. by E. | E. easterly to S.S.E. f E. easterly. The green sector shows over the Kinierbel rock and all the foul ground southward of the road stead ; the ivhite light, over the ground clear of all danger as far westward as the Chaises de Primel ; and, the red light, over the Taureau, Four, and Crapeaud rocks, which latter dangers are also covered when coming from the northward or eastward by the red sector of the Triagoz light. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station at point Bihit on the northern side of Lannion roads. Between Lannion and Perros bays is a promontory of which ile Grande, almost connected with the shore, and point Ploumenac'h or Mean Ruz, are the north-western and north-eastern extremes. Besides the Crapeaud and adjacent ledges already mentioned, the coast in this part is bordered by innumerable islets, rocks, and ledges, extending 2 miles from the north-western shore, and making any approach to it extremely dangerous.

LIGHT. \u2014 The lighthouse, 82 feet high, stands on Guen Bras rock, Plateau de Triagoz and, from it, ile de Bas light bears W. \\ S. 16^ miles, and the Sept-iles light E. by S. \\ S. 6^ miles. The lighthouse shows, at 98 feet above high water, a fixed white light varied by a flush alternately red and ivhite every half minute, visible in clear weather from a distance of 15 miles. Between the bearings N.N.E. \\ E. and N. \\ W., over the shoals westward of ile Grande, the light shows entirely red, the flashes being visible 15 miles and the fixed light 10 miles. Fog bell. \u2014 During foggy weather a bell is sounded every 4 seconds. (See note, page 10.) Caution. \u2014 At night, as soon as the light on ile de Bas is sighted, a vessel running eastward with the flood stream should steer to pass well northward of it, not bringing it westward of S.W. by W. \\ W. after passing it, in order to clear the Triagoz ledge by 3 miles ; for, this stream sets strongly to the South-east and does not turn in the offing until 3\u00a3 hours after high water by the shore. The SEPT-ILES, or Seven isles, are high and barren, and in clear weather may be seen 21 miles distant. The lighthouse on them bears W. by N. northerly 16\u00a3 miles from Heaux lighthouse, and E. by S. \u00a3 S. 6^ miles from Triagoz lighthouse. The isles, with their rocks, ledges, and adjacent shoals, occupy a space 2\\ miles wide and 4^ miles long in an E. by N. and W. by S. direction. LIGHT. \u2014 From a square lighthouse, 52 feet high, on the eastern end of the southernmost isle, the Ile-aux-Moines or Monk's isle, is exhibited, at 184 feet above high water, a fixed white light, varied every three minutes by a bright flash. The flashes are preceded and followed by short eclipses which do not appear total within the distance of 6 miles. The light is dioptric, of the third order, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 20 miles, except when bearing about W. by S., when it is obscured through an arc of 3\u00b0 by Rougic isle and the eastern end of Bono isle. Buoy. \u2014 To facilitate the navigation of the channel between the Sept-iles and the mainland, a bell buoy is moored southward of the Dervinis, the southernmost rocks of the group. c 2"], [58, "36 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I. A Life-Boat is stationed at the Ile-aux-Moines. The dangers between Sept-iles and the Plateau des Heaux mostly rise from depths of about 18 fathoms. Vessels passing outside Sept-iles and steering eastward should therefore keep well outside that depth. Sept-iles lighthouse kept bearing West until Heaux lighthouse is seen, and it, in turn, kept well southward of S.E. when within 5 or 6 miles of it, leads well outside all dangers. PLOUMANAC'H LIGHT.\u2014 On Mean Ruz, the north-eastern extreme of Ploumanac'h point, at 69 feet above high water, is exhibited from a square lighthouse a fixed red light, visible in clear weather from a distance of 5 miles.

ANSE de PERROS, li miles wide at the entrance, is 2\\ miles south-eastward f ron Mean Ruz ; it affords good shelter from westerly winds to vessels that can take the ground. Those of light draught may lie afloat in the outer part of the bay, between which and the port at the head of the bay, the beaching places, on a bottom of muddy sand about 9| feet above the lowest tides, are excellent. Tome, a narrow islet nearly a mile in length N. by E. and S. by W., is one mile north-eastward from the western point of the bay ; its highest part is about a third of its length from the northern end. The little town of Perros-Guirec has about 2,800 inhabitants ; its port is protected on the east by the Lenquin jetty 165 yards in length, a great portion of which is available as a quay, the total quay frontage of the port being no less than 515 yards. There is little or no trade, the harbour being used chiefly as a refuge for coasters, which frequently run from the outer roadstead for shelter at high water, but in so doing run the risk of being neaped. LIGHTS. \u2014 At Nantouar, in Perros bay, two fixed white lights are exhibited ; that near the shore is 33 feet high and visible 10 miles ; the inner light, at Kerjean, 750 yards from the former, is 253 feet high and visible 14 miles. Nantouar light is attached to a white house ; Kerjean lighthouse is a white tower near a farm-house. The two lighthouses in line by day, or the lights by night, lead into Perros bay through the north-western passage."], [59, "Chap. I.] 37 ANSE DE PERROS. Two fixed white lights are also exhibited at the port of Perros, viz., a light 110 yards behind the Pigeon-house, elevated 89 feet, and visible 14 miles ; and, an inner light at Kerprigent, 3,133 yards from the other, elevated 259 feet, and also visible 14 miles. The two light houses in line by day, or the lights by night, lead into the bay through the eastern channel. The Pigeon-house light is attached to a white house, the Kerprigent is a small white tower. None of these lights are visible more than 18\u00b0 on either side of the direction they are intended to indicate. A Life-Boat is stationed at Perros. Directions. \u2014 Coming from the westward in-shore, Rougic ile hidden by the ile de Bono, Sept-iles, leads between the Triagoz and all the shoals northward and eastward of ile Grande ; and, when the southern end of ile Tome is open of Mean Ruz, a course of about E. | S. leads between the Sept-iles and the northern end of ile Tome, bearing in mind that the tidal stream sometimes sets through this channel at the rate of 5 knots. If desirous of entering Perros bay from the north-westward, steer in for the southern end of Tome until Nantouar and Kerjean lighthouses are in line; with this mark on, pass westward of two pointed rocks named the Bilzic, marked by a black beacon turret, which lie nearly a mile off its western side and un cover 22 and 32 feet, and eastward of the Fronde rock, marked by a red spherical buoy, and of the red beacon turret on Bernard rock, nearly a quarter of a mile from the western point of the bay. Four patches, of which the highest is awash at low water, lie between his latter rock and the Pierre du Chenal, also marked by a red and black beacon turret ; therefore, at low water, do not proceed farther south ward than to have Perros church opening southward of the hill on the western point of the bay. But, if proceeding to the port of Perros-Guirec, with a proper rise of tide, be careful to haul to the westward in good time to bring the Kerprigent and Pigeon-house lighthouses in line, which mark leads up to the port, and great care is necessary, for a vessel overrunning this line will be upon the rocks.* Bound into Perros bay from the eastward, pass north-westward of the black conical buoy marking the Guazer rocks at the outer edge of the Four ledge, by not going southward of the line of the high steeple of Notre Dame de Clarte on with the highest part of Tome isle. As soon as the Pigeon-house and Kerprigent lighthouses are * Notice was given in August 1888, that a black wooden beacon, 9| feet above the highest tides, had been placed on the Durante rock in Perros road."], [60, "38 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I. seen, bring them in line and steer for them. This leading mark clears all the reefs extending from the mainland, including the Crebineyers, marked by a black buoy ; it also passes very close on the starboard hand the Pierre Jean Rousic, off the southern end of ile Tome, which uncovers one foot, and the Pierre du Chenal beacon turret, which bears about S.W. f S. half a mile from the southern end of Tome and which rock uncovers 14 feet. After passing close southward of this beacon, the vessel may anchor about 1^ cables south-westward of it, in from 11 to 14 feet water ; or, with a proper rise of tide, the same mark will lead her on past the beacon turrets on the Roc'h Hu and Barr Goalenou on the port hand, and the beacon of Craou on the starboard hand ; and, after passing the latter, she may haul up for the pier-head and enter the port. By Night. \u2014 Nantouar and Kerjean lights in line lead through the western passage into Perros bay ; Pigeon-house and Kerprigent lights in line, through the eastern passage. Vessels entering by the western channel should observe the caution already given and leave the line of the two former lights in one, the moment the Pigeon house and Kerprigent lights come in sight, to avoid overrunning their line of direction. PORT BLANC. \u2014 From Perros bay to point du Chateau, the western point of entrance to the river Treguier, the coast trends East 9 miles and is fronted by innumerable rocks both above and below water, extending from 1^ to 2 miles off-shore. About midway is a little inlet named port Blanc, with Chateau Neuf isle and the Four ledge on the western side of its entrance, and Leverettes and St. Gildas isles on the eastern side. The port is well sheltered and affords safe refuge for coasters during south-westerly gales but is open to winds from N.W. round by North toN.E., and vessels caught by such winds frequently run ashore under the lee of St. Gildas isle on a soft weedy bottom. With the wind eastward of N.E. the anchorage is considered preferable to that in Perros bay. The leading mark in is, Comtesse white mill on with the white beacon tower just eastward of the Voleur rock at the head of the port S. f E. A vessel will not have less than 22 feet by anchoring north-westward of the Louet, a large rock on the eastern side of the port, but better shelter in less water may be found farther in. If she can take the ground, good beaching places may be found East and E.S.E. of the Voleur, where the bottom is 10^ feet above the level of the lowest tides."], [61, "Chap. I.] PORT BLANC. \u2014 TREGUIER RIVER. 39 Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station at port Blanc. TREGUIER or JAUDY RIVER, the entrance to which is 9 miles in an E.S.E. direction from the north-eastern ledge of the Sept-iles plateau, and 3^ miles westward of the Heaux lighthouse, fully described at page 42, affords excellent, shelter but is difficult of access to sailing vessels, and, with gales from N.N.W. to E.N.E., a heavy sea runs at the entrance on the ebb. From the entrance nearly up to the little town of Treguier, a distance of 5 miles, the channel is generally over 300 yards wide and well marked by perches; near the town it narrows, and at one place is only 50 or 60 yards wide; the depths are from 6 to 2 fathoms. The town has about 3,000 inhabitants, has good quays with soft mud berths alongside, but being 16 miles from the nearest railway, has little or no trade. The river is spanned by a suspension bridge at Treguier. The three channels leading to the river entrance are, the Grande Passe, Passe du N.E., and Passe de la Gaine. Grande Passe leads to the entrance from the north-westward and is practicable for vessels of any draught. When entering by this channel, keep St. Antoine mill exactly on with the mill of Port de la Chaine, or, the white lighthouses of la Chaine and St. Antoine in one S.S.E. easterly, and the vessel will pass about 3 cables westward of the black conical buoy marking the Crublent shoal and the same distance eastward of the Renauds rocks, which never cover, and over a patch of 22 feet, which, with the leading mark on, is the least depth in this channel ; she will also pass about a cable eastward of Pierre a l'Anglais rock which uncovers 8 feet, and still closer to the red spherical buoy marking the Petit-pen-ar-Guezec shoal, the highest heads of which dry 3 feet ; and, 2 cables westward of the black beacon on the Corbeau rock, which uncovers 19 feet. By night, the red and white lights in line S.S.E. easterly lead through the Grande Passe. Passe du N.E. \u2014 The large spire of Treguier cathedral exactly on with the white tower on the Skeiviec rock, which tower is 30 feet above the level of high water, bearing S.W., leads to the entrance of the river ; but, this line crosses the Jument ledge, the western extreme of which lies N.W. by W. nearly 2 miles from Heaux light house and is marked by a red conical bell buoy moored off its northern edge ; the leading mark must therefore be left, both on entering and leaving the river, to pass westward of the ledge and buoy."], [62, "40 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. I. Vessels not drawing more than 17 feet, having rounded the western end of the Jument, may, with this leading mark on, cross the Basses de Roc'h Hir after half flood, or if the Petit Roc'h Hir is covered. This rock lies on the north-eastern part of the ledge and uncovers 13 feet. This channel should only be used with smooth water. Passe de la Gaine, the most easterly channel, is practicable with smooth water for vessels of 14 feet draught after 3^ hours' flood, and is useful when approaching from the eastward if there is sufficient wind to stem the tide. The entrance is between the Heaux and Sark rocks ; the leading mark is, the white beacon wall in the south-eastern part of the village of Plougrescan on with the white pyramid of Men-Noblance, on the southern part of ile d'Er, bearing W. by S. This leads a vessel nearly half a mile southward of Heaux lighthouse and over the Pont de la Gaine, a narrow cut in the ledge extending from thu southern end of the Duono rocks with only one foot water at low water, springs. LIGHTS. \u2014 Three lights are exhibited at the entrance of the Treguier river. Near the harbour mill of port de la Chaine is a fixed ivhite light, 36 feet above high water, exhibited from the keeper's house which is white ; it is visible 9 miles. Near St. Antoine Mill is a fixed red light 105 feet above high water, visible through an arc of 16\u00b0 on each side of the leading line for a distance of 9 miles ; the red light is distant three quarters of a mile S.S.E. easterly from the white light, and, when in line, they lead through the Grande Passe. From a lighthouse on the Corne rock, on the eastern side of the entrance, is exhibited a fixed light, 38 feet above high water, showing sectors of green, red, and white, as follows : \u2014 green on a W.S.WIy bearing, through an angle of 7^\u00b0, or between the Petit Pen-ar- Guezec and the shoal of port Beni ; red eastward of the green sector ; and ivhite on an E.N.E1j- bearing, through an angle of 7^\u00b0. The green light is visible only 4 miles, the red 5 miles, and the white 9 miles. Anchorages. \u2014 From abreast of the Skeiviec rock, 11 miles within the entrance, to the town of Treguier, the river is deep enough for coasters always to remain afloat. Tt has three anchorages, well sheltered from wind and tide, of which the best and most convenient is the Palamos anchorage, about 2 miles within the Skeiviec, where the depths are from 2\\ to 4 fathoms."], [63, "Chap. L] TREGUIER RIVER. 41 Directions. \u2014 In steering through either of the channels for the entrance of the river, keep the leading mark on until the large spire of Treguier cathedral is on with the white tower on Skeiviec rock S.W. This latter mark leads into the river, but, before running in, make sure that the tide is sufficiently high for the vessel to pass over an 8-feet patch, a cable outside the ledge bordering the eastern side of Er isle, and also over the Pie bank on which there are only 6 feet at low water, springs. After passing between the beacon on the Taureau and Corne rock, which rocks are about 1^ miles within the Pen-ar-Guezec buoy, and, between them, the deep water channel is not more than three quarters of a cable wide, and southward of the Taureau bank, steer up the river keeping mid way between the rocks bordering its banks. At night, vessels entering the Treguier river should steer with la Chaine white light on with St. Antoine red light bearing S.S.E. easterly until la Corne green light is seen, then steer for it, keeping within its green sector. Pass a short distance westward of the Corne rock and anchor within the white sector of light, which marks the inner anchorage. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the Treguier river at 5 h. 22 m. ; equinoctial springs rise about 35 feet, and neaps 21 feet. Off the town of Treguier, it is high water at 5 h. 32 m. ; springs rise 25 feet, neaps 18-j feet, neaps range 12 feet. The flood stream, which sets into this river, rounds the northern shore of Er isle until the bank connecting this isle to the main at low water is covered, which takes place at about half flood ; it then slackens at the entrance of the river and runs eastward. The rate of the flood within the river is never more than 3 knots ; that of the ebb rather less."], [64, "42 CHAPTER II. HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL.* VARIATION in 1888.-18\u00b0 10' W. PLATEAU des HEAUX, composed of rocks, of which many are always above water, is about one mile in extent E.S.E. and W.N.W. and three quarters of a mile broad. At its north-eastern edge is the rock Men-Lem, which never covers, and can be passed on its north eastern side at 250 yards distance ; on the south-eastern edge is the rock Roc'h-ar-Hanap, which also never covers, and can be passed within half a cable. The lighthouse stands on the eastern part of the plateau. LIGHT. \u2014 Heaux lighthouse is a round tower, 159 feet high from base to vane, erected on the eastern part of the plateau des Heaux ; from it, the Sept-iles light bears W. by N. northerly 16\u00a3 miles ; the light on the Roches-Douvres N.E. \\ N. northerly 15f miles ; and, the lighthouse on the Lejon rock S.E. \\ S. 19 miles. From it, also, the Paon light at the north extreme of ile de Brehat bears S.E.

The light is 148 feet above high water and shows fixed ivhite with two red sectors, one north-eastward, the other south-eastward. It is dioptric, of the first order, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 18 miles. The north-eastern sector is flashing red, through an arc of 19\u00b0 between the bearings W. \\ S. southerly and W.S.W. southerly, showing over the whole extent of the Barnouic ledge.

Vessels in the offing, with the white sector of light in sight, are clear of danger in the channel between Barnouic and Horaine ledges. Approaching from the eastward, having passed well northward of Horaine ledge, and having crossed the line of the leading lights of Bodic heights and Croix rock, Trieux channel, in line, a north westerly course may be steered, and the flashing red sector of light entered. THE COAST.\u2014 Baie de Saint Brieuc\u2014 Between the plateau des Heaux and ile de Brehat is the north-eastern entrance to the Trieux river, and on the opposite side of the ile is its eastern entrance. Between ile de Brehat and cape Frehel, distant 28 miles on a S.E. bearing, the coast line falls back forming the deep bight named the Baie de Saint Brieuc. The approach to the western entrance of the bay is indicated at night by the fixed white light on the plateau des Heaux, and in the day by the Creach-ar-Maout hill about 3 miles S.S.W. from the light. This hill forms the abrupt termination northward of the high land separating the river Trieux from the Treguier ; on its summit is a guard-house with a semaphore close to it. The bay is on all sides much encumbered by rocks and shoals both in-shore and in the offing. The land is generally high and may be seen in clear weather about 22 miles distant. In very clear weather, the summits of the central chain of Bretagne hills are visible, and amongst others the Mener-Bel-Air and the Mener-Bre ; the former rises southward, and the latter south-westward of the bay. When bound westward from cape Frehel, the parts first seen are cape d'Erqui and Bien-Assis wood on the eastern side, and then Plouha point and the small town of Plouzec on the western side of the bay. The Rade de Brehat, with the ports of Trieux, Paimpol, Portrieux, and Binic, are on the western side of the bay ; in the southern part is port Legue and the town of Saint Brieuc, with the large shallow Anse d'Yffiniac adjoining ; and, on the eastern side is the port of Dahouet, north-eastward of which is the high and steep point of Pleneuf, which juts out boldly from the land 3|- miles W.S.W. of cape d'Erqui ; the Verdelet, a conical shaped islet, lies 2 cables north westward of Pleneuf point, between which point and cape d'Erqui the coast is generally low and exposed to the North-west, but the rade d'Erqui affords good shelter with easterly winds. The hills, at this part, rise suddenly a short distance within high-water mark and unite with"], [66, "44 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL [Chap. II. the high lands in the interior ; Bien-Assis wood, on their summit, may be recognised at a great distance. Cape d'Erqui is a lofty promontory terminating in a steep slope on its western face ; between it and cape Frehel, 1\\ miles eastward, the shore is composed of high rocky cliffs, with the exception of a small sandy beach under the village of Pleherel. The little inlet, Bouche d'Erqui, lies 3 miles eastward of the cape of that name. CAUTION. \u2014 As all dangers between ile de Brehat and cape Frehel rise from soundings of less than 18 fathoms, the prudent seaman will at night or in thick weather keep without that depth. The off-lying dangers, Basse Maurice, plateau de Barnouic, and plateau des Roches-Douvres, are not included in this caution, they being surrounded by much deeper water. PLATEAU des ROCHES-DOUVRES.\u2014 This dangerous rocky ledge, the outermost of the off-lydng dangers fronting St. Brieuc bay, occupies a space 3^ miles long N.N.W. and S.S.E., and 2^ miles wide ; from it, rises a group of 12 rocky heads which never cover. The highest head of the plateau, is about 9 feet above the highest tides, and is in the middle of the group ; on it stands a white iron lighthouse. The north-western edge of the ledge bears N.E. by E., and the south-western edge E.N.E., about 15^ miles from Heaux lighthouse. For tidal streams in this vicinity, see page 196. LIGHT. \u2014 From the white iron lighthouse at 180 feet above high water, is exhibited a ivhite occulting light, showing a bright flash every four seconds, with a dark interval of three seconds. The light is visible in clear weather from a distance of 20 miles. From the lighthouse, Hanois lighthouse, Guernsey7, bears N.N.E. | E. 20 miles ; Gautier rock on Barnouic ledge bears S.S.W. 5 miles ; Heaux lighthouse S.W. \\ S. southerly 15f miles ; Lejon lighthouse S. \\ W. 22 miles ; and, the Minquiers light-vessel S.E. \\ S. 24 miles. Fog Signal.\u2014 During foggy weather, a bell is sounded fourteen times at intervals of one second, then an interval of six seconds, then a double stroke, then another interval of six seconds, then fourteen strokes, &c.

PLATEAU de BARNOUIC\u2014 About 12 miles E. by N. \u00a3 N. from Heaux lighthouse, and N.E. \\ N. 1\\ miles from the Horaine rock, are the Gautier rocks, near the middle of the Plateau de Barnouic,"], [67, "Chap. II.] ROCHES-DOUVRES AND ROC'H-AR-BEL SHOALS. 45 a dangerous: rocky ledge, of which the southern edge lies E. f N. from Heaux lighthouse. The Gautier rocks uncover 14 febt at the lowest tides, and are awash at low water, neaps. The Barnouic rock, of conical form, bears E. \u00a3 N. about three quarters of a mile from the Gautier rocks ; it uncovers 23^ feet, covers 2\\ hours before high water, springs, and is awash at high water, neaps. This plateau, of which the Barnouic and Gautier are the highest rocks, extends from the Barnouic rock about one mile eastward, about 1\\ miles S.S.W., 2\\ miles N.W. by W., and 2 miles N.N.W. The most westerly rocky patches, one of which has only 3 feet water, bear E.N.E. 11^ miles from Heaux lighthouse. There are depths of from 10 to 15 fathoms on parts of the plateau, but the sea at times breaks over its whole extent. The Roches-Douvres and Barnouic ledge are separated by a channel more than 2 miles wide, carrying a depth of from 20 to 30 fathoms. It should, however, be avoided by sailing vessels, as the streams set with great strength over both ledges. If forced to pass through it, endeavour to keep nearer the Douvres than the Barnouic. A vessel will keep westward of both ledges by not bringing Heaux lighthouse more westerly than S.W. \\ W. Basse Maurice is a small rocky patch in the channel between the Plateau de Barnouic and the shore ; from its shoalest spot of 7 fathoms, Heaux lighthouse bears W. f S. nearly 7 miles ; Paon light house, ile de Brehat, S.W. S. 6 miles ; the guard-house on Creach ar-Maout hill is on with the Louet rock W.S.W. westerly ; and, Plouha point is a little open westward of the Horaine rock, S. by W. Although the depth is never less than 7 fathoms on this shoal, it should be avoided in bad weather, as a heavy sea runs over it during a weather tide.

Carec-Mingui, a rocky patch of 11 feet, lies one third of a mile westward of the Roc'h-ar-Bel. Heaux lighthouse bearing W. \\ S. leads southward of the Basse Maurice, and northward of the Carec-Mingui and Roc'h-ar-Bel shoals, over which shoals the tide, at springs, sets with a velocity of 5 knots."], [68, "46 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II. Extensive rocky ledges, lying in a general easterly and westerly direction, extend 5 or 6 miles eastward and south-eastward of ile de Brehat, and on them several rocky heads dry at low water. The northernmost ledges are the Horaine and Echaudes ; the southern most, Men-Marc'h and Ringue-bras ; between them are navigable channels leading to Brehat road. Outside of the rocky limits, and 5^ miles from the nearest land, pointe de Plouzec, numerous banks of sand, under the general name of Banes de Sable, extend 4\u00a3 miles in a S. by E. direction from their northern end, near the eastern extreme of the plateau de Men-Marc'h ; on some of these banks the depth is as little as 2\\ fathoms. PLATEAU de LA HORAINE is a rocky ledge, 1\u00b1 miles in extent, N.E. and S.W., and one mile wide ; it has many rocky heads awash and nearly awash at low water, and one head, the Horaine rock, about a mile within the northern extreme of the ledge and bearing S.E. by E. \u00a7 E. 6| miles from Heaux lighthouse and E. by N. \u00a3 N. 3 miles from Paon lighthouse, uncovers 22 feet at the lowest tides, and is awash about 2\\ hours before high water. The Horaine rock is supposed to have a beacon on it, but it is washed away as soon as built and cannot be depended on ; from the rock, the white pyramid on Ar-Morbic rock is a little open westward of St. Michel chapel, ile de Brehat ; and, Ste. Barbe windmill is midway between two of the highest peaks of St. Riom isle. Basses du Nord are the most northern patches on the plateau de la Horaine. The shoalest spot, 10 feet, lies N.E. \\ E. three quarters of a mile from the Horaine rock ; Basse du Nord-Est, with 9 feet water, bears E. \\ S. three quarters of a mile from Horaine rock ; and Basse du Sud-Est with only 8 feet lies 1\\ miles S.E. by E. \\ E. from the Horaine rock. From this latter patch, the Horaine beacon, if in position, is on with Heaux lighthouse N.W. by W. \\ W. There is a channel of from 10 to 12 fathoms, half a mile wide, between this Basse and the Horaine ledges. Buoy. \u2014 A large red conical bell buoy is moored at the north eastern edge of the plateau de la Horaine. PLATEAU des ECHAUDES lies south-westward of the Horaine, and its highest rock, the Echaudes, uncovers 8^ feet at low water, springs. This rock is near the southern part of the ledge and, from it, the guard-house on Creach-ar-Maout hill is on with the northern extreme of ile de Brehat W.N.W. ; the white pyramid on Louet"], [69, "Chap.

It is at the north-western part of the ledge and, from it, the Chandelier, a large rock off the north-western point of the ile de Brehat is seen between the Grand and Petit Pen-Azen rocks. The Pen-Azen rocks are half a mile off the northern point of ile de Brehat ; the Grand Pen-Azen uncovers 27 feet, the Petit Pen- Azen 15 feet at the lowest springs. The Petit Pen-Azen has on it a stone beacon turret, coloured with black and red bands. Buoy. \u2014 A black conical buoy is moored on the north-western edge of the Pen-Azen shoal. PLATEAU de MEN-MARC'H is south-eastward of the Horaine and Echaudes reefs ; and, between them is a channel leading to Brehat road. This ledge is 3 miles long E. by N. \u00a3 N. and W. by S. 5 S., and 1\\ miles broad at its widest part ; the only rocky head visible at the lowest tides is the Men-Marc'h in the south-eastern part, which then uncovers 2 feet, and is at all times dangerous on account of the eddies in its vicinity. Numerous shoal patches of from 2 feet, near the western edge, to 2\\ and 3\u00a3 fathoms at the north-western part of the ledge, lie westward and northward of this rock. Buoy. \u2014 A red conical bell buoy is moored off the north-eastern end of the plateau de Men-Marc'h. PLATEAU du RINGUE-BRAS is the next ledge southward of the Men-Marc'h, and between them is a channel leading to Brehat roads ; it is 3 miles long East and West, and about a mile wide at its broadest part towards the eastern end. The Basse de l'Ascension, the highest head on this ledge, is near its eastern extreme, and has only from 3 to 6 feet over it at the lowest springs. Directions. \u2014 Vessels from the westward bound to any of the ports in St. Brieuc bay, or to St. Malo or Granville, generally pass between Barnouic and Horaine ledges. This channel is 7 miles wide, the tidal streams follow its direction, and, as before stated, the Basse Maurice, the only rocky patch in the channel, need be avoided in bad weather only. A vessel using this channel should steer to pass within 4 miles of Heaux lighthouse, and as it is approached keep it well southward of"], [70, "48 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II. S.E. to avoid the dangers westward of it. When eastward of its meridian, it should not be brought to bear more northerly than W. \u00a3 N. until the guard-house on Creach-ar-Maout hill is on with the Sark rocks W. by S. \\ S. The vessel is then eastward of the Roc'h-ar-Bel, and the lighthouse may be brought to bear W. f N., on which bearing it leads between the Basse Maurice and the red bell buoy of the Horaine. From the south-eastward, a vessel is in the fairway of this channel when Heaux lighthouse bears W. f N., and it is necessary to have it on this bearing before she is abreast of the plateau de la Horaine, which position will be ensured by not crossing the line of Ste. Barbe mill on with the highest part of the crest of St. Riom isle bearing about S.W. until the old mill on ile de Brehat, without sails, a red roof, and a broad white band below the roof, is quite open westward of the white pyramid on Ar-Morbic rock, or until the Heaux rocks appear quite open northward of the Sark rocks. To avoid the Roc'h-ar-Bel, Heaux lighthouse must be brought to bear W. \u00a3 N. Having passed westward of the meridian of Heaux light house, and until 5 or 6 miles from it, keep it well southward of S.E. to avoid all dangers westward of it. Tidal Streams. \u2014 Between the plateau de Barnouic and Basse Maurice the flood stream sets S.E. by S., and ceases about an hour after high water by the shore at ile de Brehat ; its greatest velocity, about 4^ knots, is at about half flood. The ebb runs in the opposite direction, and ceases about 5 hours before high water by the shore ; its strength is nearly equal to that of the flood. At a mile north ward of Heaux lighthouse, the flood sets S.E. by E., the ebb N.W. by W., with about the same strength. Close to the edge of the rocks it is somewhat stronger, running at the rate of 5 knots past the Heaux, over the Roc'h-ar-Bel, and both round and over the north eastern edge of the Horaine. The whirls and eddies occasionally met with in the channel between the Horaine and Barnouic ledges, are strong but not dangerous ; the most considerable is produced by the Basse Maurice. TRIEUX RIVER.\u2014 Four channels lead into this river; one only, the Grand Chenal or Trieux channel, is available for large ships at all times by day or night, and neither of the others should be attempted without the aid of a pilot, except in cases of urgent neces sity. The Trieux channel is the northern entrance between the Roc'h-ar-Bel and Horaine ledges. It may also be entered from the westward at any time of tide, by day, through the Moisie and Men-"], [71, "Chap, il] TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 TRIEUX RIVER. 49 du-Castrec channels by small vessels ; and, from the eastward through the Ferlas channel, between ile de Brehat and the mainland, which is a practicable channel for vessels of deep draught from half flood to half ebb, but can be used only by coasters at low water, springs. The river is tidal and navigable for small vessels as high as the little port of Pontrieux, a distance of 16 miles from the Paon lighthouse at its entrance. Above Pontrieux it is dammed, and the stream utilized by water-mills. Anchorages. \u2014 Several anchorages in the entrance of this river afford refuge to vessels of deep draught, . but they are difficult of access, especially on the ebb, when they should not be attempted without a pilot. As the holding ground is bad and the stream rapid, in the middle of the river, ships should anchor as near the edge of the mud-banks as possible on either side. Pomelin road is on the northern side of the river, about 21 miles within Paon light, and the marks for the best anchorage, in 30 feet and out of the tide, are, the old mill on Brehat just open northward of the ruins on ile Verte ; and, the new Mill of Loguivy seen between point du Gouern and Conan rock. A vessel should moor North and South in Pomelin roads. There is also anchorage north-eastward of this, near the outer edge of the mud-banks which uncover as far southward as the line of Croix rock lighthouse on with Loguivy mill ; vessels should moor here W.N.W. and E.S.E. Another good and well sheltered anchorage in which the streams have not much strength, and with sufficient room and depth for the largest ships, is near the edge of the mud-banks south-eastward of the ile de Bois, a high steep island close to the western point of entrance to the river. The anchoring ground here extends in a south-westerly direction from the line of the beacon on Vieille de Loguivy rock on with Arcouest mill ; anchor in 7^ fathoms with the two lighthouses at Coat-Mer in line ; and, Loguivy guard-house between the two mills, rather nearer the old mill than the new ; moor here also W.N.W. and E.S.E. The first anchorage within the river for a vessel of deep draught is near the right bank with Coat-Mer lighthouses in line, North, and N.W. of a large rock named Melus, which lies fronting the Douane or custom-house office on the Roc'h-ar-On ; a vessel of any size should not venture beyond this at night, but should anchor the moment Heaux light is shut in by the ile de Bois. There is room for two moderate sized vessels between Bodic light tower and Sabot du-Sud rock ; also, excellent holding ground on both sides of the A 2771. Wt. 7242.

Lezardrieux, a little port on the left or western bank of the river, nearly 2^ miles above the Custom-house office on the Roc'h-ar- On, is full of rocks and dries at low water of all tides. Vessels of light draught are neaped within it for 4 or 5 days ; but, at its entrance among the rocks, there is a bottom of soft mud, on which two or three coasters can ground without being neaped. Vessels can generally remain afloat in a narrow channel between this port and a rocky ledge in the middle of the river. Those bound up to Pontrieux, anchor here to wait for sufficient water when they arrive during neaps ; or, during springs, to await the aid of a local pilot, without whom no vessel should attempt the difficult passages in the river between here and Pontrieux. The first of these passages, named Ar-Toul-Tane, is at a sudden turn in the river, 4 cables above Lezardrieux suspension bridge, which bridge spans the river 108 feet above the lowest tides. The second passage is in the turn of the river under the high land and chateau of Roche-Jugut, one mile above which on its eastern side the Trieux receives the waters of the little river Leff. Pontrieux. \u2014 The little port of Pontrieux is on the right bank of the river, about half a mile below the town of that name, and 8 miles above Lezardrieux bridge. It has about 400 yards of quay frontage, all on the eastern side ; the berths at the foot of the quay dry about 22^ feet above the level of the lowest tides. The town is built on both sides of the river and has a population of about 2,500. Its trade is insignificant, and is carried on chiefly by coasters of from 30 to 100 tons, though vessels of 300 tons can ascend as high as Pontrieux. The nearest railway7 station is on the Paris and Brest line at Guincamp, about 10 miles distant. LIGHTS.\u2014 On Paon Point, at the north-eastern end of ile de Brehat, from a square lighthouse, is exhibited at 67 feet above high water, a fixed light, showing white through an arc of 8\u00b0, between the bearings N.N.W.

Paon point and Rosedo lights in line indicate the position of the Horaine rock. On La Croix rock, on the eastern side of the channel, from a round light tower at 45 feet above high water, is exhibited a white occulting light; the eclipses occur every four seconds and the light is visible 12 miles through an arc extending 18\u00b0 from the centre of the channel on either side. On Bodic heights from a square tower, at 176 feet above high water, is exhibited a white occulting light ; the eclipses occur every four seconds and the light is visible 17 miles through an arc extend ing 10\u00b0 from the centre of the channel on either side. Bodic light bears S.W. by W. \\ W. 4156 yards from La Croix light. The two lights in line is the leading mark through the Trieux, channel. Coat-Mer. \u2014 Within Bodic light, on the same side of the river, are two fixed red lights. The outer and lower light is shown from the keeper's white house on the extreme of the peninsula of Coat- Mer ; it is 39 feet above high water and is visible from a distance of 5 miles through an arc of 180\u00b0, viz., from N.E. | N. through East and South to S.W. \u00a3 S. The inner and upper light is shown from a square white tower 722 yards S.W. by W. from the lower light ; it is 150 feet above high water and is visible 9 miles through an arc of 16\u00b0 on each side of the leading line. Directions. \u2014 Trieux Channel. \u2014 The leading mark for the main entrance of Trieux river is, Bodic and La Croix lighthouses in line S.W. by W. \\ W. This mark leads south-eastward of Roc'h-ar- Bel, Men-du-Castrec, and Sirlots ledges, the latter having a red bell buoy at its eastern extreme ; and north-westward of Horaine, Echaudes and Pen-Azen ledges, the latter marked by a black conical buoy less than half a mile from the Sirlots buoy. On entering the river it also leads south-eastward of the red beacon turrets on Vieille de St. Mode, Rodello, Kerrannets, and Moguedhier rocks, and north westward of the beacon turret on Petit-Pen-Azen, coloured with black and red bands, as well as of all the dangers off ile de Brehat, including the large pointed rock Chandelier, bordering on the North the entrance to the Kerpont passage, and the black beacon turret of D 2"], [74, "52 [Chap. II. HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. Gosrod at the southern side of its entrance. The Gosrod beacon turret stands on a rock which uncovers about 13 feet, and is only three quarters of a cable eastward of the fairway. The red beacon turret on the Moguedhier is about 1\u00a3 cables N. by W. from the Croix lighthouse. Having arrived at a position 3 or 4 cables north-eastward of the Croix lighthouse, or before the vessel is abreast of the Moguedhier beacon turret, haul a little to starboard to pass a safe distance west ward of the Croix lighthouse ; after which, bring the keeper's house on Coat-Mer peninsula on with the square white tower of the inner light, which leads to the inner anchorage betweenile.de Bois and Coat-Mer. By Night, enter the river with Croix and Bodic lights in line, and when Bodic light is hidden by Croix light-tower, as it will be to an eye 8 feet above the sea, when it is 1,800 yards distant, open out Bodic light westward of Croix light and pass the latter on its western side. Afterwards, proceed with the two inner fixed red lights in line to the anchorage of Coat-Mer. Moisie Channel commences at the Moisie red beacon turret near the Sark rocks, and joins the Trieux channel near the red turret marking the Vieille de Saint-Mode. The flood stream, at springs, sets through at 4^ or 5 knots in the direction of the channel until near the rock Noguejou-bian, when it inclines south-westward towards ile St. Mode. The ebb is not quite so strong and takes more the direction of the channel as the tide falls. The leading mark is, the spire of the chapel of St. Michel, ile de Brehat, on with Rosedo white beacon tower S. E. The channel is very narrow, but is convenient for vessels of moderate length and draught entering the river Trieux with a scant wind. Men-du-Castrec Channel has its entrance between the shoals Ar-Mesclek on the West and Men-du-Castrec on the East, and joins the Trieux channel at the same point as the Moisie. The tidal streams run at the rate of 4i or 5 knots but follow the direction of the channel. The leading mark, the white pyramid on Arcouest point on with the red beacon turret of Vieille de Saint-Mode, leads through in mid-channel until near the latter, but over the eastern head of the shoal Ar-Gazec on which there are only 6 feet at low water, springs. As with the Moisie channel, this passage is used by vessels which cannot weather the Men-du-Castrec and Sirlots shoals not only in entering the Trieux river but also in making for Brehat road by the Kerpont or Brehat channels. (See page 57)."], [75, "Chap. II.] 53 CHANNELS INTO TRIEUX RIVER. Ferlas Channel.\u2014 This channel is available by day for vessels of 8 feet draught at low water, springs ; for vessels of 13 feet draught at low water, neaps ; and, for vessels of any draught at high water. To run from Brehat road into Trieux river through this channel, with the best water, weigh when the rock at the south western point of Logodec islet has just covered ; it uncovers 22 feet at the lowest tides. Steer westward to pass midway between the beacon on the Piliers and that on the Vis -Argent rocks, and half a cable northward of the summits of Rouray, Conan, and Levret rocks, which latter border the southern side of the channel and never cover ; after passing the Piliers beacon turret, bring it on with the black beacon turret of the rade de Brehat, which leads half a cable southward of Rout-ar-Linen beacon, through the narrowest part of the channel, and southward of the Rompa rock and beacon turret, which, however, may be passed on either side at half a cable ; after passing it, bring it and the Piliers beacon in line, and this mark leads into the Trieux channel, southward of the Tranquet rock, and up to the direction of the two lighthouses of Coat-Mer in line. There is a passage connecting the Ferlas and Trieux channels east ward of the Tranquet and of the beacon on the Trou-blanc, named the Trou-blanc channel. The leading mark through is, the new mill of Loguivy, kept on astern, between the Conan rock and the steep declivity of tfce northern point of Gouern cove S. f W. There are also other intricate channels connecting the Ferlas and Trieux channels. Loguivy. \u2014 Near the western entrance of the Ferlas channel is the little fishing port of Loguivy, useful to pilots and fishermen but of no importance. The harbour dries from 6 feet at the entrance to 22 feet within, at low water, springs. Pilots. \u2014 The Brehat and Trieux pilots keep at sea when the weather permits, and in fine weather may be found cruising or fishing as far seaward as the Roches-Douvres ; fishing boats are often found near Heaux lighthouse, and their masters are generally good pilots and very useful until proper pilots are met with. If a vessel is bound to Pontrieux, or anywhere above the ile de Bois roadstead, a river pilot is required. The head quarters of these pilots is at Lezardrieux. Tidal Streams.\u2014 The tidal streams off the entrance of the Trieux river have been already noticed at page 48. Within the entrance, between St. Mode isle and La Croix lighthouse, they follow the"], [76, "[Chap. II. 54 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. direction of the channel ; but, outside or north-eastward of Saint- Mode, they cross the channel with great strength, and it requires a fresh fair wind to keep the leading mark on. For time and rise of tides at the entrance of the Trieux river, see tides around ile de Brehat, page 59. ILE de BREHAT.\u2014 The south-western point of this isle is less than a mile from Arcouest point, and it extends from thence 2 miles in a N.E. by N. direction to Paon point, but is nearly divided into two about its centre. The most conspicuous objects on it are, the lighthouses on Paon point and on the little mound of Rosedo, St. Michel chapel, the northern mill, the southern mill (le Vieux Moulin) which has no sails, a red roof, and a white band 9 feet wide below the roof. The most remarkable irregularities of outline are at Paon point, at the small hill where the chapel stands, and at the hillocks crowning both points of entrance to port Clos. The isle appears distinct from the coast on a South, S.W., or North bearing, but, unless very near, it becomes blended with the land when bearing between W.S.W. and N.W. The white pyramids placed on the Ar-Morbic, Louet, and Quistillic rocks, which front the eastefn part of the isle, are also conspicuous objects and may be seen at some distance. lie de Brehat has a population of over 1,000, mostly hardy fisher men and sailors, and it has three small ports, viz., Port de la Corderie on its north-western side, port Clos on its south-western side, and port la \"Chambre on its south-eastern side ; the first is entered from the Trieux channel, the last two from the rade de Brehat. The dangers already described surrounding this isle seaward are comprised between the lines of Heaux lighthouse bearing West, and the mill on the high land a little northward of Pomelin bay on with the south-western point of ile de Brehat N.W. by W. The tidal streams, especially at springs, rush with great velocity through this chain of dangers, and produce a violent race, which, at low water, can only be passed through without risk by the narrow cut called the Brehat channel, which is 2 miles long in a S. f W. and N. f E. direction, passes about a mile eastward of Paon point, between the rocky ledges fronting the eastern side of the isle and the plateau des Echaudes, and is fully described at page 56. A Life-Boat is stationed at Paon point, ile de Brehat. Port de la Corderie, on the north-western side of ile de Brehat, is a grounding place where vessels of moderate draught find shelter,"], [77, "Chap. II.] ILE DE BREHAT. 55 and at this little port is the government store of buoys, moorings, &c. Its entrance, on the northern side of the Kerpont channel, is only half a cable wide and open to the westward, it is southward of the large rock Kervarec, south-eastward of which, at three quarters of a cable, is a rocky ledge marked by two black beacons. Only half a cable southward of these is a red beacon marking the extreme of the rocks on the southern side. Three mooring buoys lie in mid-channel to assist vessels in taking up their berths. Vessels lie aground on a bottom of mud and sand from the entrance to the head of the port. At the outer buoy it dries 5 feet, at the second buoy 8 feet, and at the inner buoy 9 feet, at low water, springs. The best berth for vessels of about 15 feet draught is 2 cables within the entrance ; the sea here is rough only when it blows hard at high water, springs. Small coasters lie eastward of this position, and sometimes in the middle of the little cove at the head of the port, where the tide rises from 5 to 6 feet less^ than in the channel. Port ClOS, on the southern side of ile de Brehat between the southern entrances of Kerpont channel and Brehat road, although difficult of access, affords refuge to coasting vessels capable of taking the ground. Three rocks, in a straight line N.E. and S.W., divide the entrance of this port into two parts. The most southern, named Men-Allen, is near low-water mark and uncovers about 19 feet ; the second is about half a cable further in, and also uncovers 19 feet ; the third is about a cable northward of the second and uncovers 26 feet, This latter rock is joined to the western shore of the port by a cause way, which serves as a landing place, and which, when uncovered, shelters the inner part of the port. The bottom at the foot of the causeway dries 1^ feet at the lowest tides ; the best berth is half a cable N.N.E. of the rock at the end of the causeway, where the bottom dries nearly 11 feet. Most vessels, however, lie outside the causeway, about half a cable S.S.E. of the rock ; the grounding places here are good, but anchors have but little hold, and at high water it is exposed to winds from between W.S.W. and S.S.E. Port la Chambre. \u2014 If surprised in Brehat road with strong easterly winds, a vessel that can take the ground will find good shelter in port la Chambre, between the south-eastern part of ile de Brehat and Logodec and Lavrec islets. It dries at low water, and its principal entrance, about half a cable wide, is between the rocks"], [78, "[Chap. II. 56 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. at the south-eastern point of the isle, and those adjacent to the western side of Logodec. A vessel cannot proceed farther into this port than the large islet lying abreast of the northern end of Logodec, which divides the channel into two branches. The best berth is about three quarters of a cable southward of that islet, where the bottom dries about 9 feet. A clump of trees surrounding Ste. Barbe chapel bearing S.S.W., and touching the eastern side of a large rock named Chateau-de-1'lle- Blanche, leads to the entrance. Rade de Brehat, on the southern side of ile de Brehat, is the only place between Heaux lighthouse and cape Frehel in which vessels of moderate draught can find shelter during strong winds from N.N.E. to N.N.W. The good holding ground trends East and West, in the direction of the white guard-house on ile de Bois on with the southern face of a high rock named Men-ar-Vran W. by N..| N. ; its eastern limit is the eastern face of Mets de Goelo islet on with the Men-Gam rock S. \u00a3 E.; and, its western limit, Ste. Barbe mill on with La Trinite point S. by W. \\ W. The best anchorage is with ile de Bois guard-house on with the southern face of Men-ar-Vran ; and, Ste. Barbe mill, or the trees of Ste. Barbe chapel, on with the summit of ile Blanche de l'Arcouest S.S.W. \\ W. This chapel is on the high land at the head of Paimpol bay, 300 yards westward of the mill. The least depth in the road at low water, springs, is 3 fathoms. A vessel should moor E.S.E. and W.N.W. DIRECTIONS for approaching RADE de BREHAT from the WESTWARD. \u2014 If wishing to seek shelter in this road from strong winds between N.N.W. and N.N.E., when pilots are not to be found in the offing, wait if possible N.N.E. of Heaux lighthouse till half flood, when the tide will have risen in the vicinity of ile de Brehat about 18^ feet. At this time, a vessel may run through Brehat channel into Brehat road without risk, for the channel, which is only 2 cables wide at low water, is then half a mile wide. Chenal de Brehat. \u2014 Having rounded the Roc'h-ar-Bel ledge, the leading mark through Brehat channel is, the white pyramid beacon on the Cormorandiere rock on with the white beacon tower at Port Moguer, near Plouha point, bearing S. \\ W. westerly; this line leads 6 cables westward of the Pain de Bray rock and leaves the whole plateau des Echaudes on the port hand, passing its nearest rock, the Cadic, which has 15 feet on it at low water, at 1\u00a3 cables. It also"], [79, "Chap. II.] RADE DE BREHAT. \u2014 CHANNELS INTO. 57 leaves on the starboard hand, the Roc'h-ar-Bel at 4 cables, the Men du-Castrec at 8 cables, and the Pen-Azen rocks at 4 cables. Until southward of Paon point, both flood and ebb streams set strongly across the channel, as they do again when Ferlas channel opens, but under cover of ile de Brehat the tides take the course of the channel. Follow the leading mark given until the red tower on Men-Garo rock comes on with the white pyramid on Quistillic rock, then haul more to the westward and bring the beacon on Piliers rock on with Lannevez mill W. \\ S. This latter mark leads into Brehat road, passing three quarters of a cable south-eastward of the Basse de Men-Garo, a small patch on which there are about 26 feet, and a long cable north-westward of the Cam-ar-Rat, another patch on which there are 23 feet, at half tide. Entering CHENAL de BREHAT from MEN-du- CASTREC or MOISIE CHANNELS.\u2014 Sailing vessels rounding Roc'h-ar-Bel from the westward, with the wind and tide from that direction, are liable to be set eastward of the entrance to the channel, and run a risk of being thrown on the Horaine or Echaudes ledges ; and, to those leaving the channel with easterly winds during the ebb, there is a similar risk of not being able to weather the Roc'h-ar-Bel, and other shoals on the western side. In the former case, and to avoid this risk, vessels pass in-shore of Roc'h-ar-Bel through the Moisie or Men-du-Castrec channels, see page 52 ; and, crossing the Trieux channel, proceed to Brehat road either by the Kerpont or Brehat channel. If taking the Men-du-Castrec channel with this object, the leading mark as already given is, the white pyramid on Arcouest point on with the red beacon turret on the Vieille-de-Saint-Mode ; this line should be held only until the Moisie beacon turret is on with Heaux lighthouse, and then this latter mark leads between the Sirlots and Men-du-Castrec ledges, northward of Pen-Azen ledge, into the Brehat channel. From half flood to half ebb, yessels of 14 feet draught may run through this passage without any risk. With the wind between N.N.W. and W.S.W., and, even at low water, pilots use it not only for vessels bound to Brehat road, but also for those bound to ports in St. Brieuc bay. If taking the Moisie channel, the leading mark through is, the spire of the chapel of St. Michel, ile de Brehat, on with Rosedo white beacon tower S. g- E. ; but, as this channel is very narrow, the services of a pilot are indispensable. As Vieille-de-Saint-Mode red beacon turret is neared, the mark should be opened a little as it leads"], [80, "HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II 58 very close to that beacon ; cross the Trieux channel in the direction of the entrance to the Kerpont channel, and proceed through it by the directions following. Kerpont Channel.\u2014 This channel separates ile de Brehat from ile Beniguet and leads into Brehat road, but is only practicable for vessels of moderate draught after 4 hours flood, when that stream begins to slacken. At low water, springs, a rocky ledge which dries 9 feet, named le Pont, connects the two islands ; between them, and over this ledge, the tide at its full strength runs at the rate of 6 knots. The leading mark through is, the guard-house on Arcouest point seen in the middle of the space between the high rocks bordering each side of the channel bearing S. by W. \\ W. ; which mark may also be used for the Men-du-Castrec channel. The Kerpont channel is practicable for vessels drawing 14| feet so long as the Vieille-de-Saint- Mode rock is covered, the least depth in the Kerpont at that time being 16^ feet. The Kerpont has two outlets to the southward ; one, midway between the south-western point of Brehat and the Noires ledge marked by a beacon turret with red and black bands on its northern rock, and by a beacon on its south-eastern rock, the Vis-Argent, which rock uncovers 17 feet ; the other, between this ledge and the large rocks off the eastern side of Raguenezbras isle marked on their eastern edge by a beacon on a rock which uncovers 19 feet at low water ; the leading mark for this passage is, the rock Beg-ar-Raz on with the westernmost house of Brehat. APPROACHING RADE de BREHAT from EAST and S.E. \u2014 The channels by which the road can be entered from the eastward are not much frequented, as the tidal streams cross them obliquely, but there is sufficient water for vessels of deep draught to run through them even at low water. The first channel eastward of Brehat channel is that between the Horaine and Echaudes ledges on the North, and Men-Marc'h ledge on the South. The leading mark through is, the summit of the high rocky islet Menou, half a mile eastward of La Trinite point, on with the two mills of Lande-Blanche S.W. f W. ; the mills are nearly in line from this direction. Follow this mark until Arcouest mill is on with a large forked rock lying close north-westward of Blanche de l'Arcouest isle W. S. or until La Rade black beacon turret is on with the white pyramid on Arcouest point ; either of these marks lead up to La Rade beacon turret, from whence a direct course may"], [81, "Chap. II.] CHANNELS INTO THE RADE DE BREHAT. 59 be steered for the road ; or, the leading marks for the Ferlas channel may be brought on if bound for the Trieux river, see page 53. The next channel to the southward is between Men Marc'h and Ringue-bras ledges ; the leading mark is, the highest point of St. Riom isle on with Lande-Blanche north-eastern mill S.W. by W. f W. until Arcouest mill is on with the large forked rock W. S., or until La Rade beacon turret is on with Arcouest white pyramid, either of which marks lead up to La Rade beacon turret. With a moderate breeze, the Ringue-bras can be crossed at neaps from half flood to half ebb, by keeping Lande-Blanche north-eastern mill on with the highest point of St. Riom isle. The Banes de Sable may also be crossed under the same circumstances of wind and tide, by keeping Arcouest mill on with the large forked rock as before described. To pass southward of the Banes de Sable, and it is not prudent to cross them at low water, springs, bring the white pyramid on Quistillic rock between the old Mill and St. Michel chapel, ile de Brehat ; this leads close southward of their southern extreme, a short distance southward of the Basse Pomoriou on which there are only 9 feet, and between Ca'in-ar-Monse rock, awash, and a small patch named the Carec Mingui on which there are only 8 feet at low water, springs. When Arcouest mill comes on with the large forked rock, or when La Rade black beacon turret is on with the white pyramid on Arcouest point, steer for it as before described. Approaching Brehat road from the south-eastward, the northern mill on Brehat on with Quistillic pyramid N. by W. \\ W. leads close westward of the highest heads of the Basse St. Brieuc, 1| miles off Minar point and marked by a red buoy on their eastern side ; these rocks are awash at the lowest tides ; also, over the north-eastern extreme of the Calemarguiers ledge, a short distance westward of the highest part of a sand-bank between this ledge and the Charpentiers ledge, close north-eastward of the Charpentiers ledge, marked by a red beacon turret, and of the white pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock. Follow this leading mark until Arcouest mill is on with the large forked rock, or until Arcouest pyramid is on with La Rade beacon turret, when proceed as before for Brehat road. Tides and Tidal Streams.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, around ile de Brehat, at5h. 51m. ; equinoctial springs rise about 39 feet, ordinary springs 31 feet, and ordinary neaps 23i feet. In Brehat road, the direction of the stream at the commencement of the flood, or 5 hours before high water, is S.W. by W. ; its greatest rate is 2 knots at 2\\ hours before high water when its direction is E.S.E."], [82, "[Chap. II 60 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. The ebb begins to run to the N.W. a few minutes after high water Its greatest rate, 1\u00a3 knots, lasts from 3 to 4 hours after high water, when its direction varies from W.N.W. to W. by N. Winds from E.S.E. to S.S.E. cause a heavy sea in the road during the flood ; the holding ground, however, is good. The streams are not strong in Ferlas channel, which is a continua tion westward of this road ; the flood follows its direction as long as the banks are uncovered ; it then sets towards Arcouest point. About 20 minutes before high water, an eddy comes from Paimpol bay and, after rounding Arcouest point, it sets with some strength towards the south-eastern point of ile de Brehat, and also crosses the eastern part of Ferlas channel towards the Kerpont. Its rate decreases about the time of high water, but it regains strength when the ebb stream makes, which latter stream takes the direction of this eddy until the banks are uncovered, when it runs westward in the direction of the channel. ANSE and PORT de PAIMPOL.\u2014 This deep bay, formed between the high points of Trinite and Plouzec, is dry throughout nearly its whole extent at the lowest tides. Guilben point divides the bay into two parts, and northward of this long neck of land are the port of Paimpol and the principal beaching places. The port is inaccessible except for boats at neaps, and has a depth of from 13 to 19 feet only at high water, springs ; the entrance is between the Kernoa pier which projects 200 yards from the southern shore, and the north extreme of the quays on the opposite shore. The little river Quinic flows through it and forms a very tortuous channel through the sands of the bay when they uncover. The harbour is about, 380 yards in length and 250 yards in breadth at its widest part, and the bottom is everywhere soft. The town of Paimpol has between 1,500 and 2,000 inhabitants and is a place of some importance from its extensive deep sea fishery, which employs about 40 or 50 schooners of from 120 to 200 tons. The quay frontage, including the pier, is not less than 450 yards in extent, the berths good, and any swell of importance very rarely felt. The bottom however being above the level of half-tide, vessels of any size arriving when the tides are taking off are liable to be neaped for several days. A wet dock 672 feet long and from 252 to 328 feet wide, with the sill at the entrance 16^ feet above the level of the lowest tides, has been lately constructed at this port on the eastern side of the tidal harbour. A life-boat is stationed at Paimpol."], [83, "Chap, il] PAIMPOL. 61 The bay of Paimpol is easily recognised from seaward ; on its northern side, by point Arcouest with a guard-house on its summit and its white pyramid beacon, northward of point de la Trinite, and by St. Riom isle, high, rocky, and with indented summit ; on its southern side, by the island Mets de Goelo, two thirds of a mile north-eastward from Plouzec point, high and with rounded grassy top sloping abruptly to the sea on all ides, with Torel, a little sugar loaf islet surmounted by a semaphore, between it and Plouzec point. Whilst, marking the off -lying reefs in the central part of the bay, are the Cormorandiere white pyramid and the two beacon turrets marking the Charpentiers and Gouayan rocks, 'the former red, the latter black. Anchorage. \u2014 There is anchorage both south-westward and south eastward of St. Riom isle, in the narrow channel separating the mud-banks of Paimpol bay from those which dry at the southern end of this isle. There is a red beacon on the Plateaux des Fillettes, southward of St. Riom. A vessel will have a good berth by mooring North and South, south-westward of the isle, in 4 fathoms, muddy bottom, with the guard-house on Arcouest point on with the northern extreme of Trinite point ; and, the white pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock between the white beacon turret on the Denou rock and the north-western rock of the Roho ledge. There is not much sea here, even during strong easterly winds, except at high water. The holding ground south-eastward of St. Riom isle is good but more exposed to easterly winds. It lies in the direction of the beacon on the Ar-Zel rock on with the summit of Blanche de Guilben isle W. f S. ; its north-eastern limit is Heaux lighthouse just opening out from behind Arcouest point ; and, its south-western limit, the guard house on Minar point a little open eastward of Plouzec point, Beaching Places. \u2014 The best grounding places in this bay are in front of port Paimpol, northward of Guilben point, and the most frequented are on the flat between the channel and the rocks which border the shore from the port to the point. The bottom is mud and sand, and dries about 16\u00a3 feet. The sea is rough here at high water, springs, when it blows hard from the eastward, but the bottom is soft, and the sea goes down before a vessel takes the ground. There is also a good beaching place between the extreme of Guilben point and ile Blanche de Guilben. The best berth is about li cables northward of the isle, where the bottom is soft mud a'nd is about 10 feet above the level of the lowest tides. Another good position, where vessels lie up during the winter, is in the northern"], [84, "HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II. 62 part of the bay, in front of the hollow in the shore under the high coast of Lande de Portz-don. At this place, a vessel drawing 10| feet will be neaped only one day. Port Lazo, also, in the south-eastern part of Paimpol bay under the high land of Plouzec point, is a good position to beach a vessel of moderate draught. The berths do not dry more than 9^ feet and are well sheltered. LIGHT. \u2014 From the gable end of the keeper's dwelling on Portz don point, on the northern shore, one mile from the entrance to Paimpol harbour, an occulting light is exhibited at 35 feet above high water showing red through an arc of 7^\u00b0 between the bearings N.W. by W. \\ W. and W. by N. f N. northerly ; and, white through an arc of 3^\u00b0 between the bearings W. by N. f N. northerly and W. by N \\ N. ; in all other directions the light. is obscured. The ivhite light is visible in clear weather from a distance of 11 miles ; the red light, from a distance of 7 miles. CHANNELS LEADING to ANSE de PAIMPOL.\u2014 There are five channels leading to the anchorages near St. Riom isle, viz., the Trinite, Lastel, St. Riom, Denou, and Jument channels; they are all difficult of access, lying in the midst of the dangers by which Paimpol bay is surrounded in all directions, and, of the five, two only, the Denou and the Jument, are, after half flood, practicable without a pilot. Trinite Channel, the entrance to which is southward of Brehat road between the Piliers rocks and those off the northern end of ile Blanche de l'Arcouest, is generally taken by vessels bound to Paimpol in charge of pilots, who have conducted them through the Moisie or Men-du-Castrec and Kerpont channels, see pages 52 and 58. It unites with the Lastel channel half a mile northward of Trinite point. Lastel Channel is a narrow passage southward of the Men- Gam rock and of the rocky ledge extending from the southern end of ile Blanche de l'Arcouest. Pilots generally take vessels to sea from Paimpol through this channel. St.- Riom channel is the narrowest of all, and is but seldom used. It is close to the north-western side of St. Riom isle, between it and the Vras rock."], [85, "Chap, ii.] CHANNELS INTO PAIMPOL BAY. 63 D6\"nou Channel is just eastward of St. Riom isle, between Garap and Rohan-heir ledges. It carries a depth of 19 feet and has the advantage of lying in the direction of the flood stream, but it is narrow and, including the space which separates it from ile de Brehat, can only be navigated by the aid of a good local pilot, and with a fair wind. After half flood, if the leading mark can be seen, a vessel may run through without risk. Jument channel. \u2014 The entrance to this channel is about 1\u00a3 miles northward of Plouzec point, between two large and remark able rocks one mile apart in a N. by E. \\ E. and S. by W. \\ W. direction ; the one, named the Ost-Pic,is at the eastern extreme of Mets de Goelo island, the other at the south-eastern edge of the Roho ledge. The channel has only'7^ feet at low water, springs, but at half flood there are 22 feet on the bank extending from the southern part of the Roho ledge to the Jument rock. The Jument, Gueule, and Gouayan rocks divide this channel into two parts, both of which are practicable for vessels of moderate draught. The Jument uncovers 1\\ feet, the Gueule 3 feet, and the Gouayan 16 feet at the lowest tides. The Jument and the Gouayan have beacon turrets, the Jument being painted with red and black bands, and the Gouayan, black ; the Gueule lies midway between the beacons, about half a mile E.S.E. of the Jument. Directions. \u2014 If bound to Paimpol bay from the northward, through the Brehat channel, and intending to run through the Denou channel to the anchorages under St. Riom isle, to the harbour of Paimpol, or to any of the beaching places in the bay ; having passed through Brehat channel by the directions already given at page 56, steer S.S.W. f W. with Rundavi mill on with the white beacon turret on Denou rock, which rock is only about a quarter of a mile E.S.E. from the eastern point of St. Riom isle. Pass within 25 yards westward of this rock as the Basse du Denou, nearly awash at low water, is but 60 yards westward of it, leaving a channel only 50 yards wide through which the tide runs with great strength. Having passed the Denou, the beacon on Ar-zel rock on with the summit of Blanche de Guilben isle W. f S. leads to the anchorage south-eastward of St. Riom isle, or the vessel may. be steered .for one of the beaching places in the bay. The leading mark given, Rundavi mill on with Denou rock, passes very closely westward of la Petite Moisie black beacon, the Moisie rock which does not cover, the Rohan-hier ledge, and the Guillaume rocks, of which the western but deepest end"], [86, "64 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II. touches the line of direction; and, eastward of Lei-Done, the north western rock of Bongreve ledge, the Garap ledge and red beacon, the Valve rock, and the rocks extending eastward from St. Riom. If the Jument channel be preferred ; having run through Brehat channel, bring the Ost-Pic on with the white pyramid on the Cormor andiere S.S.W. and the vessel will pass eastward of Cain-ar-Monse, a rock awash at the lowest tides ; when southward of this rock, or when the guard-house on Arcouest point bears W. N., steer south-eastward to bring Plouzec mill on with the eastern fall of Mets de Goelo islet S.W. by S. This line leads a cable eastward of the Cormorandiere bank. From thence, Plouzec mill on with the Ost-Pic S.W. leads eastward of the Charpentiers ledge, marked by a red beacon turret, and to the entrance of the channel. The leading mark into the anchorage is then, Bois-neuf mill on with Bervidic point, on which is a small pine wood. Pass northward of the beacon turrets on the Gouayan and Jument rocks and anchor, or steer for a beaching place as before directed. Approaching from the south-eastward, a vessel should pass between the coast and the off-lying shoals between Minar and Plouzec points, and between the Ost-Pic and the Calemarguiers rocks, by keeping the summit of the large rock at the south-eastern part of the Roho ledge on with the eastern point of Ar-Morbic isle N. \\ W. This isle is on the eastern side of Brehat, and on this bearing appears as part of it ; its eastern point is high, well defined, and is the eastern extreme of land seen to the northward. Give the Ost-Pic a berth of about 2 cables in rounding, and from thence steer for the anchorages or grounding places, passing southward of the beacon turrets on the Gouayan and Jument. At night. \u2014 Vessels approaching Paimpol anchorages at night can only enter by the Jument channel; they should keep carefully within the limits of Portz-don ivhite light, bearing in mind that the light is obscured northward of this sector, and that it shows red southward of it. Coming from the northward through Brehat channel, a vessel should enter the sector of white light shown from Paon point, and keep within its limits until Portz-don white light is seen, towards which she must then steer ; Paon point light will then change to red, and finally become obscured ; half a mile farther, Heaux light will be masked by St. Riom isle when the anchor should be instantly let go, and the vessel will be in about 5 fathoms. Tides and Tidal Streams. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Paimpol at 6h. Om. ; springs rise 31 feet, neaps 231 feet ; but, the"], [87, "Chap. II.] DIRECTIONS, PAIMPOL BAY. \u2014 GRAND LEJON. 65 bottom being above the level of half tide, there are only 13 feet in the harbour at high water, ordinary springs. The flood stream which enters Paimpol bay, after rounding the south-western part of ile de Brehat, sets S.S.W. and S.S.E. ; but, at about four hours flood, its direction is S.S.W. and S.W. and an \u00abddy begins to follow the windings of the shore from Mets de Goelo towards Arcouest point. The breadth of this eddy increases rapidly ; at one hour before high water it extends to the anchorage south-eastward of St. Riom isle, and at this time, and even after half flood, a vessel running from Brehat road to Paimpol with a light wind, had better pass eastward of St. Riom isle, and even of the Cormorandiere rock, rather than attempt the Trinite channel, which can only be taken when the wind is sufficiently strong to stem this eddy. The ebb stream follows the same direction as the eddy on the flood and forms an eddy behind each projecting point of the coast ; but, as the banks uncover, the body of the stream trends more and more towards Brehat, southward of which it divides, one part passing eastward of the isle ; the other, after crossing Brehat road, running through Kerpont channel, and between the islets and rocks westward of it. The velocity of both streams increases in the narrow channels, but around the Cormorandiere bank, as well as eastward of Mets de Goelo and of Minar point, it does not exceed 4 knots at springs and 2 knots at neaps. GRAND LEJON is the highest head of a rocky ledge 9 cables in extent in a N.E. by E. and S.W. by W. direction, nearly midway between ile de Brehat and Cape Frehel ; it is near the southern edge of the ledge, dries 23 feet at low water, and covers 2\\ hours before high water, springs. On this head stands the lighthouse, and from it, Heaux lighthouse bears N.W. \\ N. 19 miles, with Paon point lighthouse a little open westward and distant 14\u00a3 miles ; Harbour island lighthouse W.S.W. southerly 1\\ miles ; and, Cape Frehel lighthouse S.E. by E. 14 miles. From it also, the steeple of Plourhan church is on with St. Quay Point and with the lighthouse on Harbour isle ; and, Turquet mill is on with the most southern of the high lands of Erqui S.S.E. \\ E. The Bouillons, shoal patches of from 4 to 15 feet, lie nearly half a mile north-eastward of the lighthouse; and, the Basses du Sud-Est, with 2\\ fathoms least water, lie three quarters of a mile southward of it.

Fog Signal. \u2014 In foggy weather, a bell is sounded twice every eight seconds with an interval of one second between the two strokes. (See note, page 10.) PETIT LEJON.\u2014 The highest head of the Petit Lejon bears S. by E. 3i miles from the Grand Lejon lighthouse and it uncovers only 9 feet. From it, the northern mill of Plevenon is on with the northern face of the Rohinet rock S.E. by E. \\ E. ; and, Turquet mill, is on with the northern part of Lahoussaye point S.E. f S. Buoy. \u2014 A black bell buoy is moored off the western side of the Petit Lejon. Tides. \u2014 The tidal streams run with great strength in the vicinity of the Grand and Petit Lejon, and the sea is heavy in bad weather. The Coast.\u2014 From Pointe de Plouzec, Minar point bears S.S.E. E. 1\u00a3 miles. Rocks extend three cables from the foot of this point, which is high and surmounted by a white pyramid visible many miles seaward ; from it, St. Quay point bears S. by E. \u00a3 E. 7 miles, and the coast between is steep and inaccessible, except, during off shore winds, to boats on the beach of Brechech bay about If miles southward of Minar point, and on the beach fronting St. Quay village about three cables westward of St. Quay point. Plouha point, 4\u00a3 miles S. \\ E. from Minar point and 1\\ miles N.N.W. f W. from Bee de Vir, is the highest point in St. Brieuc bay ; it termi nates in a perpendicular rocky cliff, 330 feet high, and visible in clear weather 25 miles distant. Bee de Vir point is If miles north ward of St. Quay point, which is steep but much lower than the points northward of it. The Taureau rock, which uncovers 33 feet at the lowest tides, lies in the bight between Minar point and the Mauve rock, and is marked by a stone beacon tower painted with red and black bands. The"], [89, "Chap. II.] LEJON ROCKS.\u2014 COAST.\u2014 SAINT QUAY ROCKS. 67 white pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock open about half a point eastward of Minar point, leads eastward of it. The Mauve is a large rock off point Gouine-Segal, 4 cables from the shore, and 3 cables north-eastward of the Pommier rock ; it never covers, and forms with other rocks surrounding it a ledge 4 cables long East and West. The Place de Greve, the Traverse, and the Oiseaux, are shoal patches nearly on the parellel of Plouha point, and 1\u00a3 to 2\u00a3 miles from it. The Place de Greve, the shoalest and nearest the shore, carries a depth of 3 fathoms, and, from it, the southern mill of Plouzec is on with the centre of the Mauve rock ; the other two patches have from 5 to 7 fathoms over them. Abreast of the Bee de Vir and a good half mile from the shore is the northern end of St. Marc bank, which, from thence, extends about a mile southward with a least depth of 2| fathoms. Anchorage. \u2014 The shore between Minar and Plouha points is clear of dangers, with the exception of those just described, and with off-shore winds may be approached within half a mile. With the wind between E.N.E. and South, however, a vessel should avoid approaching too near, as the streams set into the bight. If obliged by a calm to anchor, endeavour to do so when the steeple of Treveneuc church is on with the Comtesse de Gueredon, a large rock at the foot of Plouha point, bearing South. ROCHES de SAINT QUAY\u2014 This rocky group, fronting the western coast of St. Brieuc bay abreast of St. Quay point, covers a space nearly 5 miles long N.W. by N. and S.E. by S., and 2\\ miles wide ; from its northern extreme, the steeple of Plouha church is nearly on with the rocks terminating Bee de Vir point, W. by N. \\ N. northerly ; and, from its south-eastern edge, 3f miles from the nearest land, Etables church bears W. by N. f N., and Roselier point S. by W. \\ W. 4^ miles. Harbour isle, the principal rock, is a large, round, steep, and isolated islet with a lighthouse on it, lying north-westward of the main group of rocks and islets, and one mile E.N.E. from St. Quay point; only 10 or 12 heads cover on this part of the group. The northernmost rock is the Tour de l'eau ; it uncovers 6 feet, and is about 6 cables northward of Harbour isle and nearly 2 cables in the same direction from the Madeux beacon turret, which is coloured red on its eastern side, black on its western side ; Plouha church steeple well open northward of Bee de Vir point, leads clear of the northern E 2"], [90, "68 [Chap.

On the south-eastern part, all the rocks cover with the exception of the Houesse, the summit of which is 35^ feet above the lowest tides and only covers at the highest springs ; the Ronde and Longue rocks, which dry 25 and 26 feet respectively and are not covered at high water, ordinary neaps ; and, the Caffa rock, which uncovers 2 feet only. The Ronde is marked by a black beacon turret, and the Longue by a beacon turret with its north-eastern face painted white. The Caffa, the south-eastern head of the group, bears E. f N. 4 miles from the eastern pier-head of Port Binic. The highest head of the Comtesses rocks, off Point Pleneuf, on with cape Frehel, or Etables and Plourhan church steeples in line, bearing N.W. by W., lead south ward of it. Plateau des Hors lies eastward of the principal rocks of the St. Quay group and is separated from them by a channel 3 cables wide which is bounded on the West by the Petit Aubert, a rock which uncovers 12 feet, and on the East by a patch named Grande Place nearly awash at the lowest tides. The north-eastern rock of the ledge uncovers 4 feet ; the marks for it are, the Rohein rock seen between Turquet mill and the high lands of Erqui S.E. by E. \\ E. ; and, the eastern peak of Mener-bel-Air mountain on with Pature point S. \u00a3 W. Buoys. \u2014 The following buoys mark these dangers on their eastern, south-eastern, and southern sides. A red bell buoy surmounted by a vane, is moored 3 cables east ward of the plateau des Hors. A red bnoy surmounted by a vane shaped like a double X is moored nearly 2 cables south-eastward of the Caffa rock. A black buoy is moored two thirds of a cable south-westward of the south-westernmost danger, the Roseliere, a rock which dries 9 feet, LIGHT. \u2014 The lighthouse on Harbour isle, the principal rock of the St. Quay group, is a square tower ; it exhibits a fixed white light at 49 feet above high water. The light is dioptric, of the fourth order, and in clear weather is visible from a distance of 10 miles. From the lighthouse, the eastern edge of the Banes de Sable bears N.N.E. 9 miles ; the Grand Lejon lighthouse E.N.E. northerlv 7i miles ; and, the Petit Lejon rock E. I S. 7\u00a7 miles.

II.] PLATEAU DES HORS. \u2014 PORTRIEUX. 69 an interval of six seconds, a double stroke, another interval of six seconds, followed by fourteen strokes, &c. (See note, page 10.) PORTRIEUX is in the northern part of Portrieux bay half a mile southward of St. Quay point ; the St. Quay rocks, lying exactly in front of it, form a natural breakwater both to the harbour and roadstead ; it is used by vessels capable of taking the ground, and dries 13 feet at the lowest tides, but at high water, springs, it has from 26 to 19 feet, and at high water of the lowest neaps, 10 feet ; and, consequently, has more water than any other port in St. Brieuc bay. The town contains about 1,000 inhabitants, and, being a watering place, its population is more than doubled during the summer months. The harbour is formed by a stone pier, extending 373 yards in a southerly direction from the northern point, which pier also serves as a quay ; the harbour is 550 yards in extent North and South, and about half that width The navigable entrance between the coast and the pier being not less than 200 yards in width, there is sufficient space for small vessels to tack if the wind should be scant on entering or leaving A Life-Boat is stationed at this port. LIGHT. \u2014 On the pier-head at Portrieux stands a white iron light house, from which at 33 feet above the sea is exhibited a fixed red light, visible in clear weather 5 miles. Portrieux road, between the St. Quay rocks and the coast, has good holding ground and sufficient depth for vessels of 14 feet draught, It should not be used, however, with strong easterly winds, except at the lowest neaps, and then only when the shelter on the eastern side of the bay in Erqui road or under Pleneuf point cannot be reached. Anchorage. \u2014 The anchorage in this road is comprised within the following limits : \u2014 The Hergue and Pommier rocks in one (the Hergue is a remarkable rock N.N.W. 6 cables from St. Quay point and has a white beacon turret, the Pommier is a similar rock close to Plouha point, and has a whitewashed mark) ; the Hergue on with the foot of the steep declivity of Plouha point ; Caruhel Mill on with the Four rock white beacon turret ; and, Portrieux church on with the centre of Portrieux pier. The depths are from 14 to 18 feet between the southern limit and the line of St. Michel mill on with the pier-head. On this latter line, from West to East, there are from 10 to 20 feet, and, between it and the northern limit, from 11 to 12"], [92, "70 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II, feet. The best berth with most water is, with Etables steeple on with the Four rock ; and, St. Michel mill and the pier-head in line. Directions. \u2014 Vessels approaching either the roadstead or port of Portrieux from any direction, may do so by passing between St. Quay rocks and the coast, or by rounding the southern end of these rocks, according as tide and wind best serve. To pass between St. Quay rocks and the coast ; bring the Moulieres red beacon on with Four rock white beacon turret S. f W. This mark leads between the northern part of St. Quay rocks and St. Marc bank, and should be kept on until the vessel has arrived within 3^ cables N.E. by E. of St. Quay point, when Herflux and Longue beacon turrets will be in line and should be steered for, to clear the Mouliere rocks which uncover 15 feet, until the Four beacon turret is on with the lofty spire of Pordic church S. by W. f W. ; follow this direction until the leading mark for the southern part of the channel comes on, viz., the Hergue white beacon turret and Pommier rock in line N.N.W. \\ W., passing between the conical black buoy of the Noirs on the port hand, and the red buoy marking the Pi-Alien shoal on the starboard hand. In steering with the Four beacon turret on with Pordic spire, if the vessel is above 14 feet draught, do not wait until the Hergue and Pommier rocks are in one, but leave that direction the moment the Hergue is on with Plouha point. The vessel, if not drawing more than 14 feet, may now either anchor in Portrieux road, as directed, or, if the tide suits, she may run on S.S.E. \\ E. with Hergue and Pommier rocks in one, remembering that this mark leads over the Basse Meridionale de la Rade, a shoal of 6 feet ; close to another of 8 feet, 3 cables N.W. of the 6-feet shoal ; and, over the Traverse, a sand-bank which trends upwards of 1\\ miles iii a S.S.W. direction from the southern part of St. Quay rocks and on which the least water is 4 feet, When Etables steeple is on with that of Plourhan N.W. by W. ; or, when cape Frehel lighthouse is on with the highest point of the Comtesse rocks, the vessel may either haul to the eastward with the latter mark on, or steer for port Binic, avoiding the Ours-Seul rock, which uncovers 9 feet and is 4 cables from the shore 1\u00a3 miles northward of that port, by not coming nearer the shore than to have the Four rock beacon turret on with Comtesse isle. Approaching the roadstead by the southern passage, it is necessary to ascertain that there is a sufficient rise of tide to cross the Traverse bank and other shoal patches just named. The height of the tide"], [93, "Chap. II.] PORTRIEUX. \u2014 PORT BINIC. 71 by the Ronde and Longue rocks, which uncover 25 and 26 feet, is a useful indication of the depth on these shoals. To enter the port of Portrieux, the leading mark is Portrieux spire on with the extreme end of the pier ; this leaves at a short distance on the port hand the Four, Vache, and Pannerais rocks. The Vache uncovers 7 feet, and the Pannerais 12 feet, at the lowest tides. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots for Portrieux also take vessels to ports Binic and Legue ; they generally cruise as far seaward as the Lejons. No stranger should attempt the channel between the roches de St. Quay and the coast, or enter either of these ports without a pilot. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Portrieux at 6 h. 0 m. ; ordinary springs rise 32 feet ; neaps 23^ feet. The tidal streams in, Portrieux road follow nearly the direction of the Hergue and Pommier rocks in line. At springs, the greatest strength of the flood between Harbour isle and St. Quay point, as well as among the rocks northward of the road, is 4^ knots ; the strength of the ebb is rather less. PORT BINIC is less than 3 miles southward of Portrieux, and about 5 miles N.W. f N. from Roselier point ; it is at the head of a little bay half a mile wide and open to the eastward. It consists of an outer and inner harbour. The outer harbour is formed by the Penthievre mole which extends 384 yards from the northern point of the bay in a south-easterly direction, its outer portion turning abruptly southward ; at its outer end is the lighthouse. The inner harbour is greatly sheltered by this mole though, as the bay is naturally quite open eastward, the swell and sea caused by easterly gales are much felt in both. The entrance to the inner harbour is between two stone jetties ; the inner harbour is 550 yards in length eastward and westward, and has an average breadth of 93 yards. The berths at the foot of the eastern jetty dry 17 feet, and those near the landing creek at the upper end of the port 25 feet above the lowest tides ; those alongside l'Estacade, the southern jetty, are the highest, and are only used by vessels of small draught. The outer port has from 3 to 6 feet more water than the inner port and can be entered by vessels of about 10 feet draught at high water, ordinary neaps, and those of 14 feet can enter it from 1^ hours before to H hours after high water, springs. It affords good shelter, with winds from South round by West to N.N.W., but with strong winds from North round by East the shelter is bad, and vessels strike heavily before the"], [94, "72 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II. tide leaves them ; the sea, at such times, is high at the entrance, and it is then necessary to enter at the top of high water. The town of Binic has over 1000 inhabitants and its chief industry consists in its extensive deep sea fishery, about 30 vessels averaging 170 tons, and carrying 1600 hands, leaving this port annually for the Newfoundland cod fishery. With this exception its trade is unimportant. LIGHT.\u2014 A fixed white light is exhibited from a circular granite tower on the mole-head at port Binic ; it is 36 feet above high water and is visible in clear weather 10 miles. Directions. \u2014 When bound to port Binic, if the wind is between N.N.E. and W.S.W. a vessel with a sufficient rise of tide, may pass between the coast and St. Quay rocks ; with the wind between N.N.E. and E.S.E. she can pass on either side of these rocks ; but, if between S.E. and S.W., she should keep eastward of them. With strong winds from N.E. to East, a vessel should always pass eastward of them, but, before venturing so far into the bay, a calculation should be made, allowing for the 'scend of the sea, that the tide has risen sufficiently high over the broad flats in front of the port to prevent all risk of striking the ground. Passing eastward of St. Quay rocks, which it is generally prudent to do at neaps ; if, after rounding their south-eastern extreme, it is found that the vessel cannot fetch port Binic, shelter may be sought under Roselier point, 5 miles south-eastward of Binic ; see also Directions at page 76. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at port Binic at 6 h. 3 m. ; springs rise 30 feet, neaps 22^ feet, When the Longue rock, at the southern part of the St. Quay group is awash, there are 14f feet at the foot of the outer pier-head of port Binic ; 11 feet at the entrance of port Legue ; 12i feet at the entrance of port Dahouet ; and, nearly 23 feet on the grounding places close southward of Roselier point. When the highest head of the Trahillions ledge or the Grand Lejon rock, cover, they both uncover 23 feet at springs, there are 1H feet at the outer pier-head of port Binic ; 7| feet at the entrance of Legue ; 9^ feet at the entrance of Dahouet. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels waiting tide to enter port Binic or port Legue can anchor, in fine weather, abreast of Binic on a bottom of clayey mud in about 3 fathoms, with the Pommier rock and Hergue white beacon turret in line, bearing N.N.W. \\ W."], [95, "Chap. II.] PORT BINIC. \u2014 THE COAST. 73 The COAST rises in height gradually from St. Quay point to Binic, between which place and Roselier point it is high and steep, except at Rosaires beach, south-eastward of Pordic Point, where boats can always land with off-shore winds. The bank bordering the coast dries out one mile abreast of Binic, and half a mile at Rosaires beach. On the bank northward of Binic are several rocks besides the Four and the Ours-Seul, 1^ miles southward of the Four, and both already described. Close westward of the Four is Fille rock, which dries 19 feet, and 2 cables southward of it is Noyes ledge, which dries 2 feet above the bank. The Equerrets, Petit-Gripet, and Grand-Gripet, are three small rocky ledges abreast of Rosaires beach, and dangerous to vessels borrowing too closely on the shore. The highest head of the Equerrets bears E. by S. \\ S. 8 cables from the foot of Pordic point and uncovers about a foot. The highest head of the Petit-Gripet uncovers about a foot, and is about half a mile from the shore, with the Martin, a high rock which never covers near the shore northward of Roselier point, on with the foot of Roselier point S. by E. \u00a3 E. there are more than 14 feet water on this danger when the eastern extreme of the Martin rock is covered. The Grand-Gripet, with 2 feet over it, bears N. by E. f E. nearly 1\\ miles from the Martin, the summit of which is then a little eastward of the principal house of a large farm on the high land. ROSELIER POINT, 5 miles S.E. f S. from port Binic, is high and steep on its northern and southern sides, but terminates in a gentle declivity on its eastern side. If a vessel can take the ground, there is excellent shelter close southward of this point, on the northern shore of a little bay called port Aurelle, protected from all winds from South round by West to N.E. The bottom, of muddy sand, dries only 3 feet above the lowest tides, so that, if of about 14 feet draught, she can run for shelter from two hours before to two hours after high water. The COAST between Roselier and Pleneuf points, which bear E. h N. and W. \\ S. distant 6% miles from each other, falls back to the southward and forms the head of St. Brieuc bay, in which are port Legue, the Anse d'Yffiniac, and port Dahouet. Several dangers front this part of the shore, of which the farthest in the offing are the Trahillions, Basse Herbaut, Trois Tetes, and the"], [96, "74 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II. Daouet. The Trahillions form a rocky ledge, about three quarters of a mile in extent E.S.E. and W.N.W. at the edge of the bank, which, abreast of Guettes point, dries more than a mile from the shore at low water, springs ; the ledge is terminated at its eastern end by a rock which uncovers 23 feet on which is a beacon turret ; and, at the western end, by another rock which uncovers 83 feet, Basse Herbaut and the Daouet rock are both awash at the lowest tides, the latter being marked by a red spindle buoy moored off its northern side. The Trois Tetes, lying between the Herbaut and Daouet rocks, have only two feet over them, and their inner head, called the Armelent rock, has on it a red beacon. A vessel will pass outside all these dangers by keeping the summit of cape d'Erqui open northward of Petit Verdelet islet about the width of that rock ; or, by keeping Rohinet rock, off cape d'Erqui, on with the highest head of the Jaunes rocks, off Pleneuf point, N.E. by E. I E. ; and, 200 yards westward of the Trahillions, by keeping the spire of the church of St. Pierre at St. Brieuc, or the mill near the church, on with the houses of Sous-la-Tour, a little hamlet in front of Cesson tower, at the foot of the high land which forms the southern side of the entrance to the river Legue. LEGUE or PORT de St. BRIEUC is about a mile within the mouth of the river Gouet, the entrance to which is 1\u00a3 miles southward of Roselier point and between Chatern and Cesson points, the latter being the north-western extreme of Yffiniac bay. Legue owes its importance to the proximity of the large town of St. Brieuc, only a mile distant and with a population of 16,500. St. Brieuc is in direct railway communication with Paris and Brest, and also with the Morbihan coast line. The port extends to the bridge. above the town of Legue and has over 1,500 yards of wharfage, besides a wet dock 325 yards long and averaging 71 yards wide, which has, however, only 14^ feet water at spring tides. Between 500 and 600 vessels enter the port annually, their average tonnage being 54 tons, and one third of them are either English or Norwegian. A considerable steam traffic exists at certain seasons between here and the Channel islands. The port can only be entered by vessels of any size at springs, and is at all times difficult of access although well buoyed. The bottom between Cesson point and Sous-la-Tour hamlet dries 15 feet, the berths at the foot of the quay 20 feet, and those near the bridge 22 feet, above the lowest tides. On the summit of Cesson point are the ruins of Cesson tower, which tower serves as a landmark and can be seen from a distance of 15 miles. From a little northward of"], [97, "Chap, ii.] LEGUE. \u2014 ANSE D'YFFINIAC. \u2014 DAHOUET. 75 Chatern point, the channel into port Legue is marked by beacons and buoys, red on the northern and black on the southern side. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed ivhite light is exhibited from a circular tower on Aigle point, at the entrance of port Legue ; it is 43 feet above high water, and is visible in clear weather 10 miles. Bane de Chatern and Gallettes rocks are the only dangers to be avoided when entering port Legue. The bank trends in a S. by W. direction from Roselier point and rests upon Chatern point. The Gallettes is a small ledge which uncovers 10 feet, 3 cables eastward of Cesson point. Directions. \u2014 When bound to Legue, if from the westward, follow the directions given at pages 47, 56, 70, and 76, until southward of the St. Quay rocks ; or, if from the eastward, those given at pages 82-84, until past the Rohein rock ; then steer to bring Roselier and Cesson points in line S.W. by S., which will be the leading mark until within 2 miles of the former point ; then steer towards Pature point until the northern tower of the church of St. Michel, at St. Brieuc, is seen between the southern tower of the same church, on which there is a telegraph, and the most southerly houses of Sous-la-Tour hamlet, which mark leads to the entrance of the port. Vessels before bearing up for the port should carefully estimate the depth of water over the sands in its front by observing the height of the tide at the Longue rock, or at the Martin rock. When the eastern head of the latter is awash, there are only 3 feet in the channel from off point Aigle to Sous-la-Tour hamlet ; when the next head to this, is awash, there are 1\\ feet at the same place ; and, when the Longue rock is awash, there are 11 feet. ANSE d'YFFINIAC\u2014 This deep bight, between Cesson and Pature points, is choked by- sands over which the tide flows at high water, but which are uncovered for miles at low water ; a good mark for their outer edge being, a line drawn from the Martin rock to the Trahillions beacon turret ; and, to keep well outside this edge, the mark is, Bien-Assis wood open northward of the old semaphore of Dahouet. DAHOUET.\u2014 The entrance to this little inlet bears E. \\ S. 5\u00a7 miles from Roselier point, and is 1\\ miles south-westward of Pleneuf point ; it is between the shore on the port hand and the pier-head on the starboard hand ; there is also a red beacon turret"], [98, "76 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. II. on the Petite Muette rock in the entrance, to be left on the star board hand. The port is open to the North-west, but affords fair shelter to small vessels which can take the ground. The trade is chiefly with the Channel Islands but is very inconsiderable. There are about 300 yards of quay frontage, and the town or village consists of 30 or 40 houses, with about 200 inhabitants. The bottom of the harbour dries 13 feet above the level of the lowest tides abreast of the pier-head ; 18 feet in front of the western part of the quay ; about 22 feet at the angle of the quay ; and, 24 feet near the mill sluice at the head of the port, The principal dangers in approaching the port from the northward are, the Bignons des Jaunes, the Godiche, and the Daouet rock. The Bignons des Jaunes are, at the south-western edge of the Jaunes ridge and uncover 24 feet ; when they are awash there is plenty of water over the Godiche, 10^ feet at the entrance of the port, and 4 or 5 feet at the grounding berths within. The Godiche is a small patch of 7 feet half a mile westward of the Bignons, with the Petit Bignon a little open southward of the summit of the Jaunes. The Daouet Rock is three quarters of a mile north-west ward of the entrance of the port, and is awash at low water, springs ; it is marked by a red spindle buoy on its northern side. Should the buoy be gone, the small steeple of Pleneuf seen over the downs, and open about half a point northward of the steep coast northward of the point, leads northward of the rock. > Tides. \u2014 It is high water, fjn.ll and change, at port Dahouet at 6h. 5m. Springs rise 32 feet, neaps 23^ feet. Springs rise at the foot of the western part of the quay from 16 to 20 feet, neaps from 5 to 6 feet. When the Longue rock is awash, there are 12^ feet water at the entrance ; when the Bignons des Jaunes are awash there are IO5 feet, and when the highest head of the Trahillions covers there are 9^ feet.

The Rohein rock, at the south-western extreme of the Rohein ledge, is high above the level of the highest spring tides, and, from its isolated position, is easily recognized from some distance. This ledge is about one mile in diameter, many heads are uncovered at low water, and others awash, or nearly so. On its southern edge, eastward of the Rohein rock, the Basse Ronde uncovers 26 feet, and the Basses du-Sud-Est, 24 feet. At its northern extreme, the Basse des Daouelins is a dangerous patch ; from the least water on it, 3 feet, the extreme of cape Frehel is touching the southern side of the Rohinet rock E. by S. ; and, Pature point is a little open westward of the Rohein S.W. by S. The Comtesses are half a mile in extent E.S.E. and W.N.W., and uncover at low water throughout. The two westernmost heads are always uncovered. Between the Comtesses and the Rohein ledges, the Lue rock uncovers 24 feet at the lowest tides. Basse des Comtesses is a small ledge about a cable long, and its highest head, which uncovers 3 feet, bears N.

The highest head is the Evette, near the eastern end, on which is a beacon turret ; one cable eastward of this is the Izard rock, at the edge of the ledge, which uncovers about 6 feet. Pierres-du-Banc are two rocky patches 3\u00a3 miles E. by S. \\ S. from the Petit Lejon. There are never less than 2f fathoms water on them, but they are dangerous in bad weather when there is a heavy sea over them on a weather tide.

The Grande Liviere, with 14 feet water, lies N.W. \\ W, westerly 3 miles from the cape, with the lighthouse nearly touching the southern extreme of the Amas-du-Cap. A vessel will pass northward of this patch by keeping the summit of Amas du-Cap on with the lighthouse. At night, the light should not bear more easterly than S.E. by S.

Vessels ground on a bottom which dries about 16 feet above the lowest tides, and are sheltered from N.N.W. round by East to South. The southern side of the bay is formed by the lofty point of Lahoussaye, which is prolonged seaward by an islet and some rocks. A jetty is constructed in the northern angle of the bay, 1^ cables westward of the little hamlet of La Chaussee ; it affords safe shelter against westerly winds to vessels capable of taking the ground. The bottom at the foot of the jetty-head, which should be left to port on entering, dries 13 feet. About 150 coasting vessels enter this little port annually. Rade D'Erqui, close to the southward of cape d'Erqui, in front of Erqui bay, is the only anchorage on the eastern shore of St. Brieuc bay affording tolerable shelter from easterly winds. The holding ground is good, but it is prudent to leave it, especially in the winter season, if the weather is threatening and the wind likely to veer to the westward.

About half a mile north ward of Champ du Port point, the western point of the inlet, is the islet of St. Michel which is joined to the coast at low water and on which stands a chapel. This is the only place on this part of the coast where, in bad weather and when compelled to do so, a vessel can run ashore with the hope of saving her crew. The vessel even might be saved if she were beached southward of Champ du Port point about an hour after high water.

Through the Landas Channel. \u2014 If far enough to windward, this channel, between the Petit Lejon and Pierres du Bane, is prac ticable for vessels of the deepest 'draught after half flood.

A vessel will keep east ward of the Petit Lejon by having the Verdelet rock open eastward of the summit of the Comtesses ; she will also pass north-eastward of the Basse des Comtesses, and of the Comtesses, by keeping Turquet mill in sight eastward of Lahoussaye point, which mark will also ensure her not being too close to the eastern part of the Portes d'Erqui, marked by a beacon turret. The dangers on the eastern side of the channel may be avoided by not standing eastward of the line of Turquet mill just touching the high land of cape d'Erqui. The Channel between the Rohein and Petit Lejon may be taken when seeking shelter in Erqui road, either on the flood or the ebb. The summit of the Comtesses on with the southern ex treme of Bien-Assis wood S. by E. \\ E. easterly leads half a mile westward of the Grand Lejon and 2 cables westward of the Petit Lejon, close to the black bell buoy marking the latter. Steer with this mark on until past the Petit Lejon, when Turquet mill will be on with Lahoussaye point ; haul up for it, opening the mill a little eastward of the point to avoid the Comtesses, &c, and this will lead into the road as before."], [105, "Chap.jl.] CHANNELS INTO THE RADE D'ERQUI. 83 In following this route before half flood, great care must be taken to avoid the Daouelins and Comtesses patches, and the Izard rock, Portes d'Erqui, on the southern side of the channel, as well as the Petit Lejon on the northern side ; also, at low water and in bad weather, a 21-feet patch S. by E. \\ E. three quarters of a mile from the Petit Lejon. The Channel between the Rohein and the Jaunes may be taken by a vessel too much to leeward for either of the others, and it is sufficiently deep for vessels of moderate draught even at low water. Having passed the Rohein rock, and in working up for the rade d'Erqui, when standing northward, cape Frehel lighthouse open southward of the summit of the Comtesses clears the southern part of the Rohein ledge ; and, the lighthouse on with the large pointed rock at the foot of cape d'Erqui clears the southern part of the Portes d'Erqui. In making the southern board, cape Frehel lighthouse open northward of cape d'Erqui leads northward of the Jaunes ; and, Turquet mill well on with the steep coast which separates the beach of Erqui bay from the beach of the large bay to the southward, keeps her northward of the Ecarets rocks which uncover 2 feet at the lowest springs. Pleneuf point bearing S.W. by W. leads northward of the Guyomere and of the Ecarets, and between the Portes d'Erqui and the cape. Through Erqui Channel. \u2014 If surprised by strong easterly winds between cape Frehel and St. Malo, a vessel may bear up for shelter in Erqui road by passing through the Erqui channel between half flood and half ebb. For this purpose, having rounded cape Frehel, steer to the westward with the southern end of Amas-du-Cap islet touching the extreme of the cape E. f S. ; this mark leads northward of the Jars, Truie, Malicorne, and Mouillee rocks between the cape and St. Michel islet, and of all the rocks fronting the coast until abreast of the red buoy of the Justieres, when the steep point of Pleneuf will open out ; bring it on with the rock forming the extreme of cape d'Erqui, bearing S.W. by W. \\ W. westerly ; then, with this mark as a guide, steer to pass about 2 cables from this rock and round it into the road. The most dangerous part of this channel is when cape d'Erqui bears between S.S.W. and S. \\ W. ; the vessel is then abreast of the rocky patches of the southern part of the Rohinet plateau which dry 5 feet at the lowest springs, and are marked by a red buoy at their edge. The Erqui channel may also be run for by passing through the shoal patches between the Petite Liviere and the Bignons rocks when F 2"], [106, "84 [Chap. II.

When running through the Erqui channel for any of the ports on the western coast of St. Brieuc bay, proceed as if bound for Erqui road until the highest summit of the Comtesses rocks is on with the Rohein W. by N. \\ N. Steer westward in this direction passing 2 or 3 cables southward of the Comtesses and Rohein ; after passing the Comtesses, their highest point on with the Rohinet leads south ward of the Rohein and also of the St. Quay rocks. Or, keep St. Michel islet in sight and quite detached from Marre-aux-Rets point, the eastern point of the little bay immediately eastward of cape d'Erqui, which mark leads northward of the Portes d'Erqui ; the extreme of cape Frehel on with the large pointed rock at the foot of cape d'Erqui leads southward of this ledge and northward of the Jaunes. Tidal Streams. \u2014 The flood tide sets about East, and the ebb tide West through the Erqui channel ; at springs, both tides run at the rate of 4 knots. Round cape Frehel it runs with great strength, at least 5 knots, and there are strong eddies occasioning a heavy breaking sea in bad weather. To avoid these, although the cape is steep-to, vessels should give it a berth of one or two miles at such a time. CAPE FREHEL. \u2014 This promontory is the northern extreme of a high narrow neck of land a mile in length, 7\u00a3 miles eastward of cape d'Erqui and nearly 12 miles westward of St. Malo. It is bordered on all sides by steep perpendicular cliffs about 150 feet high, and in clear weather may be seen from a distance of 15 or 18 miles. On the summit of some level land near its extreme are two towers 113 feet apart, of which the southernmost, an octagonal tower 72 feet high, is the lighthouse ; it stands 550 yards S.S.W. from the cape.

It again rises in. the vicinity of pointe de Champeaux, a bluff and nearly perpendicular headland, and from thence to Granville is of moderate height, the flat sands extending off it in this neighbourhood being interspersed by low, flat, rocky ledges. ANSE des SEVIGNES, between cape Frehel and Latte point, has many dangers within it, and should not be run for as a place of shelter in heavy weather from the S.W., on account of the great overfalls in it caused by the steepness of the coast, and the violent squalls off the land to which it is subject. Bane de l'Etendr^e lies off the northern part of Sevignes bay ; from the Etendree rock at its western end, which uncovers 14J feet, it extends about three quarters of a mile in a S.E. by E. direction, and is a quarter of a mile broad ; some parts of it are nearly awash at the lowest tides. Basse de la Latte and Basse Raimonde.\u2014 These rocks, lying southward of the bane de l'Etendree, render the approach to Sevignes bay or to within a mile of this rugged and precipitous coast very dangerous, though the fishermen congregate here occasionally in great numbers. The Latte bears N.N.E. E. 3^ cables from the fort on Latte point, and uncovers a foot at the lowest tides ; the Raimonde bears N.N.W. \u00a3 W. 4 cables from the fort, and uncovers 9 feet. A vessel passes north-eastward of the Latte by keeping St. Jacut mill well open of St. Cast point. BAIE de la FRENAY, between Latte and St. Cast points, affords good shelter with off-shore winds but is quite exposed to those from the N.E. The entrance is 2 miles wide, and from thence the bay trends 3i miles in a S.W. by W. direction to its head, but more than 2 miles of that expanse dries at low water. The surrounding land is high, and its northern shore free from danger. The holding ground is good, and the best anchorage is in from 4| to 5 fathoms, about half a mile off Cierge point, just southward of Latte point, with cape Frehel lighthouse seen between"], [110, "88 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. Cierge point and Latte fort. The only precaution to be used in taking up a berth is to make due allowance for fall of tide. At high water, vessels under 9^ feet draught can cross the high bank which dries out from the head of the bay, and reach the beach ing places of Portmieux and Port-a-la Due. Both are on the western shore, the first behind, and the latter about a mile south-westward of Muret point. The BourdinotS are two small r'oeky ridges, one 6 cables, the other 1tl miles E. \\ N. from St. Cast point. The easternmost ridge, on which there are 34 feet water, is dangerous only when blowing hard ; but the westernmost ridge, on which the highest rock dries 7 feet, must be carefully avoided The marks for this rock are, Chesne windmill, in ruins, twice its width open westward of the Bec-Rond rock W. by S. \\ S. ; and, St. Jacut highest windmill open eastward of the summit of Colombiere islet, which islet is half a mile westward of the Ehbiens, S.| E.

St. CAST POINT, 4 miles S.S.E. \\ E. from cape Frehel, is high and nearly perpendicular on all sides. The approach to it is rendered dangerous at low water by the Bourdinots, by low- water rocks which extend 3 cables from the foot of the point, and by the Chelin, a small sand-bank with only 10 feet water N. by E. nearly half a mile from the point ; Teignouse point, the first point south ward of cape Frehel, on with Latte point, leads outside the Chelin bank and between St. Cast point and the Bourdinots ridges. Anse de St. Cast.\u2014 Southward of St. Cast point, in front of the village of Lille St. Cast, the coast forms a small bay which affords to vessels capable of taking the ground good shelter from westerly winds. The head of the bay, at three quarters of a cable from the shore, is of muddy sand, on which spring tides rise from 24 to 30 feet, and neaps about 15 feet. In steering for the beaching place, keep the village bearing about West, and do not approach the Bec- Rond rock within one cable."], [111, "Chap. III.] ST. CAST BAY. \u2014 iLE DES EHBIENS. 89 Arguenon bay. \u2014 From St. Cast point, at low water, dry sands connect the shore with the ile des Ehbiens and with the opposite coast in the vicinity of St. Briac harbour, the tw-o deep bays of Arguenon and Lancieux, separated by a narrow promontory ending in point Roche, being then dry throughout. The Arguenon river flows into the head of the bay of Arguenon. Vessels capable of taking the ground will find shelter from easterly winds on the eastern shore of this bay. They should be placed abreast of an old convent, with St. Jacut windmill bearing S.E. ; and, Ehbiens islet shut in by Chevet point. Here the tides rise from 19 to 26 feet at springs, and 9^ feet at neaps. The river Arguenon is navigable up to Plancoet, at springs, for vessels of about 9 feet draught. A ILE des EHBIENS, about a mile in circumference, is at the head of the bight between cape Frehel and St. Malo. It is surrounded by high rocks, and near its centre there is a large and conspicuous tower which may be recognised from a great distance. It is joined to the shore at low water by the bank of sand before described, which borders the coast from St. Cast point to the entrance to St. Briac. Close southward of Ehbiens there is a well-sheltered grounding place, much frequented by coasting vessels formerly but not much used since the channels into St. Malo have been well lighted and marked. It is formed by a natural causeway of shingle, always uncovered and uniting the south-western extreme of the island to some high rocks 2 cables to the South-west. The bottom is muddy sand and seaweed, and dries 7 or 8 feet above the lowest tides, which rise from 28 to 35 feet above it at springs, and 18 or 19 feet at neaps. The best place for grounding, sheltered from all winds, is about half a cable from the southern end of the island, with Agot island entirely shut in by the south-eastern extreme of Ehbiens. There is also anchorage in from 2 to 5 fathoms in the bay betweeen ile des Ehbiens and Agot, but it is open to northerly winds, and in the centre of the bay is the Platus rock, marked by a beacon turret painted with red and black bands ; on the eastern and southern sides of the bay are several rocks, of which the Mouliere, marked by a beacon, dries 31 feet, the Rochefort dries 39 feet, and the Gautrat dries 17 feet. Directions. \u2014 When running for the grounding place at the southern end of Ehbiens, as soon as the island is made out, steer to"], [112, "90 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. pass about 1\u00a3 cables eastward of the Haehes, a ridge of rocks, of which some are always uncovered, extending half a mile in a north-easterly direction from its northern point. When Ehbiens tower bears N.W., haul close round the south-eastern point of the island and anchor, or, if necessary, run the vessel on the beach. If obliged to beat in, be careful to avoid the Platus and other rocks just described, as well as a half -tide rock one cable eastward of the high rocks at the southern end of the causeway. St. BRIAC\u2014 This little tidal harbour has little or no trade, is difficult of access, and should never be attempted without a pilot. It is at the entrance of a narrow valley 1J miles eastward of Ehbiens and about three quarters of a mile southward of the high projecting point of Haye. The entrance, 2 cables wide, is between the Perronais beacon marking the westernmost rock of the ledge extending south-westward from the southern end of Perron isle, about one cable distant from it and which dries 12 feet, and a beacon on the extreme of a rocky ridge projecting northward from the peninsula of Lancieux ; this latter rock dries 15 feet at the lowest tides, and, in entering the harbour, a vessel should steer to pass between these two beacons. The channel narrows considerably half a mile within the beacons at the entrance, and a vessel has then to pass between rocky heads, marked by beacons, the highest of which uncovers 19 feet, leaving on the starboard hand the Banchot and Cheruette beacons ; on the port hand, the beacons on the Cheval and the Ane, and passing the Bouche beacon, in the middle of the channel, on either side ; after which she may anchor or ground as desired ; three warping buoys are placed to assist vessels to their berths. The tides run with great strength in the channel, and the harbour is exposed to a heavy sea with strong north-westerly winds. Pilots berth vessels N.N.W. of the town of St. Briac, with their heads towards the ebb stream, on a bottom of sand and mud, over which the tide rises from 20 to 26 feet at springs, and from 12 to 13 feet at neaps. There are 6 feet more water at the entrance of the harbour than here. In a little bight in the northern part of the harbour, vessels may lie, out of the stream and sheltered from all winds, on a bottom of soft mud ; but, if of more than 13 or 14 feet draught, they will be neaped for three or four days.

CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. CAUTION. \u2014 In fine weather, the two rocks last described can be dangerous only at low water and to very deep ships ; but, in bad weather, they should be carefully avoided by all vessels in conse quence of the heavy breaking sea they cause, especially on a weather tide. VIEUX BANC is a rocky ledge nearly 4 miles north westward of Cezembre isle, which generally betrays itself by a rippling. It is about 4 cables long E.S.E. and W.N.W., 2 cables wide, and has several heads with but little water on them. From the highest head, which uncovers 5 feet at low water, equinoctial springs, at the western extreme of the ridge, cape Frehel lighthouse bears W. by N. 6 miles ; and, Grand Jardin light S.E. 3| miles.

Directions. \u2014 When steering eastward along the coast between cape Frehel and Grouin point, at or after half ebb, bear in mind that so long as the Herpin rock is twice its breadth open northward of the Rochefort black and red beacon turret, the vessel will pass northward of the Vieux bane, and of all dangers between it and the Rochefort ; also, that in coming from the eastward, with cape Frehel lighthouse open northward of the Rochefort, there is nothing to fear from the Tintiaux or from any of the shoals in the immediate vicinity of Grouin point ; this latter is, however, a very distant mark. ST. MALO.\u2014 The town of St. Malo stands at the mouth of the river Ranee, on the eastern side, on the small rocky island of Aaron. It was in former times connected with the mainland by the Sillon, a narrow causeway three quarters of a mile long ; in the construction of the modern Bassin-a-Flot, or inner harbour, this causeway has been greatly widened and strengthened and now forms the northern side of the basin, with extensive quays and railway accommodation. The whole area of the island is occupied by houses, and the walls are flanked by towers washed by the sea.* The manufactures are hosiery, cordage, soap, fishing nets, &c, but they are not extensive ; there is also a large tobacco factory. Ship building is carried on, and besides building slips there are two gridirons for repairs, but as yet no facilities for extensive repairs to iron hulls or machinery. Vessels are fitted out for the foreign and coasting trades, the former being chiefly with England and the northern countries of Europe, and for the whale and mackerel fisheries ; 1,197 vessels, of an aggregate of 192,935 tons, entered the port in the year 1886. The imports consist chiefly of coal, iron, pitch, &c. ; the exports of barley, butter, potatoes, fruit, wine, pro- * See Admiralty plan, port St. Malo and environs, No. 2,700 ; scale, m = h inches."], [116, "94 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. visions, &c. Regular steam communication is maintained with the Channel Islands, and from thence with England, by the steamers of the London and South-Western Railway; and there is regular communication with Cardiff, Hull, St. Brieuc, Granville, and Havre by lines of steamers. Steam ferries also ply between Dinard, on the opposite shore of the Ranee, St. Malo, and St. Servan. The population of St. Malo by the last census in 1886 was 10,500, and that of the adjoining town of St. Servan 12,163 ; St. Servan stands on higher ground and may be considered a suburb of St. Malo. ST. MALO PORT, situated south-eastward of the town, is large, well frequented, and, with St. Servan, has 2,560 yards of quay frontage ; it is difficult of approach, the flood rushing in with great strength, and equinoctial tides rising to the height of 4f feet above the level of low water of those tides. It is also inconvenient of access to vessels of deep draught during the winter months, owing to the fact of high water, full and change, occurring at 6 h. 5 m., i.e., before daylight in the morning and after dark in the evening. The port or inner harbour of St. Malo and St. Servan has been converted into a Bassin-a-Flot or wet dock, with an interior reservoir, used for laying up dismantled shipping, by means of a strong granite wall thrown across the entrance, having two openings, formed into locks with flood gates. The width of entrance of the largest lock is 58 feet, length 234 feet, and the tide rises above the sill from 14 feet at high water of the lowest neaps to 33J feet at high water, highest equinoctial springs ; see tides, pages 99.* The portion of the Bassin-a-Flot belonging to St. Malo has an area of 38 acres and a width of 153 yards ; that belonging to St. Servan an area of 29 acres and a width of 207 yards. Coals are always obtainable at from 18s. to 20s. per ton, from 3,000 to 4,000 tons being usually in stock; vessels coal alongside the quays, where there is always sufficient water for steamers of from 1,000 to 1,200 tons. The Mole des Noires, a neat and substantial stone pier, built on the Noires rocks at the south-western angle of the town, in addition to its great convenience for landing passengers, protects the port from the heavy roll of the sea, to which it would be other wise exposed with north-westerly winds. The pier is 1,290 feet long, about 16 feet wide, and at its head is a lighthouse. A Life-Boat is stationed at St. Malo.

ROADSTEADS. \u2014 There are two good roadsteads at the mouth of the river Ranee, where vessels of deep draught generally anchor to unload, or to await tide to enter the port ; they are, the Rade de St. Malo and the anchorage of Dinard. The Rade de Solidor, off the bay of that name and abreast of St. Servan, is too shallow and confined to receive vessels of large size."], [118, "96 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. RADE de ST. MALO is on the eastern side of the entrance to the Ranee, 4 cables westward of the town of St. Malo ; it occupies a space about 2 cables long, North and South, is a cable wide, and has from 27 to 32 feet water throughout, It is bounded on the North by the Basse Broutard, on the East by the sand-bank which fronts the town and dries at low water, and on the South by the Plateau de la Ranee, the northern head of which bears S. \u00a3 E. 2f cables from the Broutard. The Petite Rade is southward of the plateau de la Ranee. Basse Broutard is a small rocky patch about 130 yards long E.S.E. and W.N.W., and 60 yards wide, with only 8 feet water ; from it, the sentry box on Varde point is seen between Grand and Petit Bey islets ; and, St. Hydeuc church steeple is a little open northward of the northern bastion of the ramparts of St. Malo, East a little southerly. Plateau de la Ranee. \u2014 This rocky ledge, 2\u00a3 cables in extent North and South and one cable wide, has on it six dangerous heads, two of which uncover, one 2 feet the other 3 feet, at the lowest tides, when there are from 1 to 2 feet only on three of the other heads, and 16 feet on the sixth, which is at the northern part of the ledge.

The best position is in the middle of the road, with the eastern head of the Bizeux on with the high rock at the foot of Bechard point ; and, the mound on Garde Guerin point a little open southward of the summit of the Grand Vide. Vessels of light draught _anchor a little eastward of this. The road is well-sheltered from all winds between West and N.E. round by South and East, but northerly and north-westerly winds, when they blow with any strength, send in a heavy sea during the time the ledges outside the river are covered, i.e. from 2 h. before to 2 h. after high water, at springs. The flood stream in the road never exceeds 3 knots ; and the ebb, which Bechard point turns towards the opposite shore, never runs with sufficient strength to prevent com munication with the port. When it blows hard from the westward, sailing vessels wishing to leave the road for the port, or for a more sheltered anchorage in the river, should not weigh until the ebb stream has fairly made, to enable them to work to windward. There is also fair holding ground in from 18 to 22 feet in the Petite Rade de St. Malo, a short distance southward and south-eastward of the Plateau de la Ranee. When at anchor in the centre of this road, the extreme of Bechard point is on with the middle of the Bizeux, and the outer angle of St. Louis bastion is open about half a point southward of the mole-head. ANSE de DINARD.\u2014 This bay is abreast of St. Malo on the western side of the Ranee, between points Dinard and Vicomte ; grounding places extend along its western shore, from the old ship yard below the village to the new one beneath the mill on Dinard point. The bottom here dries from 12 to 15 feet, with a very gradual slope towards the edge of the bank, springs rise above it from 18 to 24 feet, neaps 9 or 10 feet ; it is composed of stiff mud covered with seaweed, and when it blows hard from the N.E. vessels strike heavily in grounding, and, as the anchors of small vessels bite with difficulty, care should be taken to bury them in the mud at low water ; avoid also grounding eastward of the line on which Grande Conchee fort begins to open eastward of Dinard point, as the bottom there is deeply furrowed. Dinard Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels of deep draught, unable to enter port St. Malo during neaps, often await spring tides at this anchorage, where they are well sheltered from all but northerly winds. It is just outside the outer edge of the mud in Dinard bay, and is half a mile in extent from the Petit Palais A 2771.

The best anchorage, where the depths are from 26 to 30 feet, is limited northward by the line of the Solidor tower seen between the extreme of Bechard point and the little fort ; and, southward, by the same tower open its own breadth northward of the high steeple of St. Servan church. This roadstead is the general rendezvous for vessels of war, and two mooring buoys are laid down in the northern part of it; the anchorage is preferable to that of St. Malo road, being better sheltered against the prevailing winds, though the holding ground, except close to the edge of the mud, is not so good, and the tides are stronger. Ships at this anchorage should always be ready to weigh or slip, as bad weather may at any lime make it necessary to take shelter farther up the Ranee. ANSE de SOLIDOR, on the western side of the town of St. Ser van, is a cable wide at the entrance, and its shores are almost entirely occupied by the military establishments of the town. Merchant vessels remaining some time in the bay are usually placed at the entrance, between the quai des Corbieres and the rocks at the foot of Solidor tower, where the bottom dries 12 or 13 feet, and springs rise from 25 to 32 feet above that level, neaps about 15 feet. A stone slip with a wooden platform at the end, for the accommodation of passengers from Dinard, extends from near the Solidor tower to the edge of the sands which dry ; this is very dangerous to vessels entering Solidor bay. When the Petit Bizeux rock is awash there are 15 feet water over the platform at the end of the slip. A small grounding place called St. Pere port, in the northern part of the bay at the foot of the peninsula of La Cite, northward of the Solidor tower, is about 84 yards wide, 270 yards deep, and will contain 14 or 15 vessels of the tonnage and draught of those employed in the Newfoundland trade. The grounding places towards the middle of this bay dry 10 feet. Vessels' of about 13 feet draught can enter at high water, neaps.

Bane de Solidor bounds Solidor road to the westward and un covers 8 feet. Its northern extreme is 85 yards southward of Bechard point ; from thence it extends 3 cables S.S.E. and terminates less than 100 yards northward of the Bizeux rock. It is about a cable broad, and composed of fine white sand mixed with broken shells. RIVIERE de LA RANCE.\u2014 The Ranee is tidal as far as Dinan, 14 miles above St. Malo, and navigable at high water the whole distance ; but, the last anchorage at which vessels of any size can lie afloat at low water is at Jouvente, only 3 miles above St. Malo. Tides and Tidal streams.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at port St. Malo at 6h. 5m., equinoctial springs range 44f feet, ordinary springs rise 36|r feet, ordinary neaps 25\u00a3 feet, The water rises above the sill of the Great Lock 33|- feet at equinoctial spring tides, 28f feet at ordinary springs, and 18^ feet at ordinary neaps. The streams run with great strength during springs at the entrance of the Grande and Petite Conchee channels, the flood north-eastward, the ebb south- westward. Their rate is about 4 knots at half tide, across the Grand chenal de la Ranee until as far in as the Buron beacon turret. Southward of the Buron beacon turret the flood curves and sets into the river with the same velocity. The ebb from the river divides, one part running out by the Grand chenal, the other by the Decolle passage. Both streams take the direction of the latter passage and run at about the same rate. CHANNELS leading into the RANCE.\u2014 All the channels leading into St. Malo are between Garde Guerin and Varde points, through the midst of the numberless dangers by which the coast is so thickly studded. These channels lead between rocks, some always above water and many others which uncover between a quarter ebb and low water, and amongst sand-banks and shoals, of which some are dry or nearly awash at low water, springs ; several small islets, however \u2014 such as Cezembre, Grande Conchee, Harbour isle, the Beys, and the higher' rocks \u2014 serve as good marks by which these dangers may be avoided. The main course of the Ranee extends 3^ miles north-westward beyond Dinard point and St. Malo, through the Grand chenal de la G 2"], [122, "100 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. Ranee, with its double opening through the Grande and Petite Porte channels. Entering by the Grande or Petite Porte channels, there are not less than from 4 to 5 fathoms at low water ; this entrance is, therefore, navigable at all times by vessels of deep draught. Besides this channel there are five others through which pilots take vessels with a proper rise of tide ; they are, the Decolle, close to the land south-westward of the Grande Porte ; the Petite and Grande Conchee ; the Petits Pointus ; and, the Bigne. The four last are all eastward of the island of Cezembre. With easterly winds, pilots prefer entering the Ranee by the Conchee, in preference to the Grande or Petite Porte channels, the eddies with these winds not being so violent in the Conchee as in the other channels. DECOLLE PASSAGE lies close along shore westward of the entrance to the Ranee, from Dinard point to Decolle point, on, which latter is a semaphore ; it can be navigated by vessels of moderate draught from half flood to half ebb ; in case of need, those of deep draught may use it with a leading wind at springs, from one hour before until one hour after high water. Pilots prefer this channel with an off-shore wind, as the sea is then smooth ; its limits are defined by beacons placed on rocks, nearly all of which cover at high water, springs, and its western entrance is between Decolle point and the Mouilliere rock where its breadth does not exceed half a cable. Directions. \u2014 Vessels entering the Decolle passage from the westward generally pass between Agot, a high and narrow islet about one mile westward of Garde Guerin point, and Nerput, a high isolated rock which uncovers 40 feet 8 cables northward of that point, and on which is a red beacon tower 13 feet above high water. This entrance has the advantage of being directly with the tide, but in stormy weather it cannot always be taken, as breakers sometimes extend completely across the pass between Decolle point and La Mouilliere. The lighthouse on the Mole des Noires, St. Malo, just open north ward of the high rocks at the extreme of Decolle point E.S.E., leads between the Nerput rock and the Grande Brousse bank, on which there are only 11 feet water (but at the time of tide when this passage is navigable there are at least 30 feet over it), and 1\\ cables northward of the Platier des Lardieres. Keep this mark on until"], [123, "Chap. III.] ST. MALO. \u2014 DECOLLE PASSAGE. 101 the steeple of St. Hydeuc church is on with the summit of the Grand Buzard E. by S., which leads in the deepest part through the western entrance of the passage, about three quarters of a cable southward of the beacon on the Mouilliere rock ; if the Grand Buzard is covered, keep Parame church and St. Hydeuc windmill in sight between Fort Royal and Harbour isle, with the church the same distance north ward of the fort as the mill appears southward of the isle. Having passed these narrows, proceeding with La Latte fort on with the Nerput N.W. by \u00a5.|W, or with the southern mill of Talard, white , twice its width open northward of the Mole des Noires lighthouse and on with the end of the white mark on the Mole, the vessel may run eastward between the Petit Buzard and Petit Genillet rocks and between the Mouille and Rochardien rocks, all of which have beacons, and, when near the latter, the dome of St. Servan church will be seen between the two chimneys of the house in Fort la Cite, which from thence is the leading mark until the maregraphe at point Bechard is on with a little clump of trees between points Corbiere and Aiguille, or until the highest of the Cheminees rocks is on with the cleft in the Mouille rock, either of which marks leads into the fairway of the river between the Pierres d'Amourette and the Roches Bonnes, and between the Pourceaux rocks and Mi-Maree rock off Dinard point, all of which rocks are also marked by beacons. If the tide is low, the dome of St. Servan church will not be visible, but only the standard of the lightning conductor on its summit. The Mouille rock is at the western end of the Pourceaux bank, and it uncovers 39 feet at the lowest tides ; when it is more than 3 feet above water, a vessel must pass between Dinard point and the Pourceaux rocks by the directions just given, but when the Mouille is covered, or is less than 3 feet out of water, vessels of considerable draught may run across the bank between that rock and the Pierres d'Amourette rocks, there being then at least 4 fathoms over it. To cross the bank, steer E. by S. with the mound on Garde Guerin point, seen over the land of Decolle point, well open northward of the Grand Vide rock, which never covers ; this mark leads up to St. Malo road, where vessels generally anchor until there is sufficient water to enter the port. This passage is much used by vessels leaving St. Malo on the\" ebb by the Decolle passage, the narrow and dangerous pass between the Pourceaux beacon turret and Dinard point being thus avoided. Vessels often pass northward of the Nerput rock and enter the Decolle passage either by running between the beacons on the"], [124, "102 [Chap. ILL CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. Mouilliere and Petit Pot-de-Beurre rocks, or by passing close eastward of the beacon on the latter. Either of these channels has the disadvantage of a beam tide, but the former has a good depth of water and is nearly a cable wide. To steer through it, keep well northward of the Nerput, and bring the white marks of Roche Pelee and Pival in line bearing S.S.E. \u00a3 E. easterly ; this leads through the centre of the channel up to the leading marks already given for the Decolle passage, leaving on the starboard hand at 4 cables a 19-feet patch named Rat du Nord-Est, at nearly one cable the Basses des Marechaux, and at less than half a cable the outlying rocks of the Mouilliere. On the port hand, it passes two thirds of a cable from the Sauts-aux-Chiens, half a cable from the Grande Basse, and close past some rocks awash at low water extending more than a cable south-westward from the beacon on the Petit Pot-de-Beurre. To pass over the reefs and eastward of the Petit Pot-de-Beurre, bring St. Enogat mill on with the northern extreme of the little patch of white sand just westward of Pelee point S.E. by S. ; this mark leads over the Sauts-aux-Chiens, a rocky patch on which there are 10 feet at low water and from 30 to 36 feet at half flood, and half a cable eastward of the Petit Pot-de-Beurre beacon. When this beacon is passed, haul a little southward to enter the Decolle passage and to avoid a small rock which uncovers 4 feet a cable southward of the Grand Pot-de-Beurre. As soon as the leading marks for the Decolle passage come on, proceed as before directed. From St. Malo Road to Solidor Road. \u2014 When southward of the plateau de la Ranee, the two principal dangers to be avoided between St Malo and Solidor roads are the Rat de la Merciere and the Merciere ridges ; the former is a small isolated rock with only 4 feet water in mid-channel N.W. N. 3^ cables from Bechard point ; when the Pourceaux rocks are covered there are 17 feet on this danger, and 22 feet when the tide reaches the foot of the Pierres d'Amourette beacon. The Merciere ridge is half a cable westward of La Cite peninsula. The highest head on this ridge uncovers 20 feet at the lowest tides, covers a quarter of an hour before half flood at springs, and is marked by a beacon. At neap tides, vessels bound to Solidor road may pass on either side of the Rat de la Merciere ; but, at springs, they should keep as much as possible over towards the eastern bank of the river, to avoid the strength of the tide, and pass eastward of the Rat. For this purpose, .when abreast of St. Malo, keep the eastern head of the Bizeux rock and the Merciere beacon in one S. by E. \\ E. until the"], [125, "Chap. III.] ST. MALO. \u2014 GRANDE AND PETITE PORTE CHANNELS. 103 Mole des Noires lighthouse is on with St. Malo church ; then steer to pass three quarters of a cable westward and southward of the Merciere beacon. In case of necessity only, a vessel may run between the Merciere beacon and La Cite peninsula by keeping the Mole des Noires light house on with the north-western side of the Calfats rock ; but the tides run strongly in this passage, which is only two thirds of a cable wide and has a depth of 13 feet at low water. On account of the eddy during the flood occasioned by Bechard point, the most favourable time for entering Solidor road is at high water by the shore. Vessels entering before that time, when round ing Bechard point and for the space of about a cable East and West, experience the flood stream setting with great velocity south-westward, and the eddyr, not less strong, setting north-westward. The eddy begins to be felt near the shore about 2 hours before high water, and its breadth and strength increase as the tide rises. To enter the road, the tower of Grand Larron on with that of Solidor leads between Bechard point and the Solidor bank ; when within the latter, anchor as convenient ; but, to take up a safe berth, the services of a pilot are necessary. GRANDE and PETITE PORTE CHANNELS. \u2014 The Grande and Petite Porte channels are the only passages into the Ranee navigable at low water. They are westward of Cezembre island, are divided from each other by the Pierres des Portes and other rocks, and unite between the Grand Jardin and the Pierres de la Savatte, at the entrance of the Grand Chenal de la Ranee ; they may be used by vessels of the deepest draught at all times ; no large square-rigged vessel, however, should attempt either channel except with the wind free and of sufficient strength to enable her to keep the leading marks on and to stem the tide, bearing in mind that the course when within the narrows is about S.S.E. \u00a3 E. The tidal streams in the vicinity of the chain of scattered rocks which divide these two channels are very strong during springs, attaining a velocity of 4 or 5 knots, and making them always dangerous at low water, as well as at other times, when the wind iB fresh on a weather tide, by reason of the overfalls they occasion. A description of these rocks now follows : \u2014 The Buharats rocks, of wdiich the highest head has only 7 feet water, is the westernmost of this rocky chain, its shoalest spot bears W.N.W. H miles from Grand Jardin lighthouse, with the"], [126, "104 [Chap. Ill CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. Nerput rock beacon turret on with the summit of the mound on La Haye point S.W. westerly ; St. Malo church steeple on with Petit Bey fort S.E. \\ E. easterly ; and, Grande Conchee fort midway between the northern poirit of Cezembre and Meinga point E. \\ S. Buoy.\u2014 A black bell buoy is moored off the southern side of the Buharats. The Pierres des Portes are three high rocks, of which the central one uncovers 37 feet, N.W. by W. 6^ cables from Grand Jardin lighthouse ; a beacon tower surmounted by a ball stands on the westernmost rock, which dries 25 feet at low water, springs, -and scarcely covers at high water, neaps. Several shoal rocky patches extend about 2 cables in a westerly direction from the beacon tower ; they are named the Couillons de la Porte, and, E. by N. \\ N. at 2 cables distance are the Basses Nord-Est des Portes, with 11 feet water, extending a cable further in the same direction ; with the Basses a Louise and the Fontaines des Portes, with one shoal spot of only 3 feet, at their western end. Buoy. \u2014 A black conical buoy, with the word rock in white letters, is moored on the southern side of the Pierres des Portes rocks, nearly one cable S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. from the beacon tower. The Bunel, Hupions, &C. \u2014 The Bunel, the north-eastern rock of the chain, is the only one lying eastward of the Petite Porte channel ; it uncovers 12 feet, and bears N. \\ E. 6 cables from Grand Jardin lighthouse. The Hupions, on which there are 27 feet water, and the Grande Hupee, with only 3 feet, lie, the first 6^, the other 5 cables N.N.E. from the beacon tower on the Pierres des Portes. The Grande Hupee is very dangerous ; the marks for it are, the highest head of the Pierres des Portes on with the summit of Bellefard point S. by W. \u00a3 W. ; and, the southern end of the fort on Varde point touching the northern side of the Petite Conchee E . by S. \u00a3 S. S.W. 2 cables from the Grande Hupee is the Rat des Courtis, of 27 feet ; and, westward one cable from it, La Nouvelle Decouverte, a patch with as little as 11 feet. Buoy. \u2014 A black and red conical buoy is moored off the northern side of the Bunel rock. THE GRANDE PORTE CHANNEL extends H miles in an E.S.E. direction from its commencement southward of the Buharats rocks to its junction with the Grande Ranee channel near"], [127, "Chap. III.] ST. MALO. \u2014 GRAND CHENAL DE LA RANCE. 105 the Grand Jardin lighthouse, passing between the Pierres des Portes and Banquetiers rocks, northward of which latter and two thirds of a cable distant is the Boujaron rock, which uncovers 13 feet and is marked by a red beacon turret, and the Basse du Boujaron, awash at low water and nearly a cable N.E. \u00a3 E. from the turret. The eastern part, at the entrance of the Grande Ranee channel, is about 2 cables wide ; its limits are marked by an iron beacon surmounted by a ball on the outer rocks of the Grand Jardin, and by a similar beacon on the rocks off \"the Pierres de la Savatte. Grand Jardin, Savatte, and Traversaine rocks.\u2014 The Grand Jardin beacon marks the northern side of the channel ; it stands on a rock which uncovers 19 feet S. \u00a3 W. 70 yards from Grand Jardin lighthouse. The Savatte or Pierre a la Vache beacon, on the southern side of the channel, is on the Pierre a la Vache, the easternmost rock of the Pierres de la Savatte ; it uncovers 22 feet and is awash at about half flood ; this beacon bears S.S.W. 3 cables from the lighthouse. The Traversaine, a rocky bank one cable in extent N.W. \\ N. and S.E. \\ S. and half a cable wide, lies in mid-channel between the two beacons ; it is steep-to and is dangerous at low water, having only 4 or 5 feet over it at that time. Buoys. \u2014 Besides the buoys already described, marking the northern side of the channel off the Buharats and Pierres des Portes, are the following three buoys : \u2014 1. A red buoy moored about half a cable north-eastward of the Basse du Boujaron, from which the Pierres des Portes buoy bears N. \u00a3 W. Ii cables. 2. A red buoy northward of the Sou rock at the northern extreme of the Pierres de la Savatte, 2\\ cables N.N.W. \u00a3 W. from the Savatte beacon, and 4\u00a3 cables S.E. by E. \\ E. from the first buoy. 3. A red buoy near the south-western edge of the Traversaine, between and nearly on a line connecting the Savatte and Grand Jardin beacons, about 1\\ cables from the former. GRAND CHENAL de la RANCE is 2\\ miles long from the Grand Jardin to St. Malo road. It is bounded on the western side by the Pierres de la Savatte; by the Pierre Salee flats, which have from 3 to 12 feet on them ; by the Buron, an isolated conical rock which uncovers 24 feet and has on it a red beacon turret surmounted by a ball ; and, by scattered rocky heads as far up as the Pourceaux rocks. On the eastern side, it is bounded by the off-lying rocks of the Grand Jardin ; by the Pierres Gamier, of which the highest head"], [128, "[Chap. Ill 106 CAPE FREKEL TO GRANVILLE. uncovers 5 feet ; and, by the rocky heads on the western slope of the Ouvras ridge, of which the greater part uncover at low water. The narrowest part of this channel is between the Basse du Buron, a small rocky head with only 3 feet, and the Buron rock ; they bear E. by N. h N. and W. by S. J S. from each other, and are 1^ cables apart. At 2 cables north-eastward from the Basse du Buron is the Ouvras beacon, on the highest head of that reef, which uncovers 17 feet. Buoys. \u2014 The eastern side of the channel is marked by the following four black buoys : \u2014 The first or outer buoy is moored near the south-western edge of the Pierres Gamier S.E. 3i cables from the Grand Jardin beacon. The second buoy is moored on the western edge of the Clefs d'Aval, the northernmost rocks of the Ouvras ledge ; it bears S.E. \u00a3 S. from the outer buoy. The third buoy is just westward of the Basse du Buron, and, with the Buron beacon turret opposite, marks the narrowest part of the channel ; it bears S. by E. \\ E. easterly 4 cables from the second buoy. The fourth buoy is near the southern edge of the Ouvras ; it bears S.E. by S. 2^ cables from the third buoy. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Grande Porte Channel.\u2014 The leading mark through this channel is, Grand Jardin and Rochebonne lighthouses in line E. by S. S. This direction leads two thirds of a cable southward of the Buharats bell buoy ; close southward of a rocky head of 20 feet ; a cable southward of the Pierres des Portes black buoy ; one third of a cable northward of the Basse du Boujaron red buoy ; and, only 50 or 60 yards northward of an 18-f eet patch north eastward of the Basse du Boujaron buoy. When nearing Grand Jardin lighthouse, alter course just before the lighthouse in Anse des Sablons comes on with Ballue light-tower, and then proceed with these objects in line S.E. by S. This course leads close past the edge of the 3-fathoms spur off the south-western end of Grand Jardin ; nearly half a cable eastward of the Traversaine bank ; close to the edge of Pierre Salee Flats ; and, from thence, in mid-channel between the red beacon turret on the Buron rock and the black buoys on the edge of the Ouvras, to the Rade de St. Malo. By night, the same directions will apply by using the lights. Or, when within 2 cables of Grand Jardin lighthouse, bring the Seminaire or college of St. Servan open about half the apparent breadth of its front eastward of the eastern angle of La Cite citadel"], [129, "Chap, in.] ST. MALO. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 107 S.E. by S. ; this leads half a cable north-eastward of the Traversaine and of the Pierre Salee flats, and three quarters of a cable eastward of the Buron rock beacon turret. At low water, care is necessary to avoid the 18-feet spur extending nearly half a cable south-westward of the Grand Jardin beacon, which may be done by keeping the leading mark slightly open until the beacon opens northward of the mound, then keep the fairway mark again. A vessel is eastward of the Traversaine bank when St. Lunaire mill _ is its own length westward of the Haumet rock. When rounding the Grand Jardin, another good mark leading to St. Malo road is, a large chimney in St. Servan open eastward of St. Servan church, so as to see daylight between them. The Grande Porte channel may be entered between the Buharats and the Pierres des Portes, and, with a leading wind, this route is the best at low water ; the leading mark is, the steeple of St. Enogat church on with the eastern side of Haumet rock S. by E. \u00a3 E. until the north-western windmill of Petite Parame is seen between the south-eastern mill and the south-eastern angle of Fort Royal S.E. f E. ; this leads southward of the Pierres des Portes black buoy, and mid-channel between the Pierres de la Savatte and the Traversaine bank up to the leading mark for the Grand chenel de la Ranee. The face of the mill as well as the south-eastern angle of Fort Royal are whitewashed, in order to be easily recognised at a distance. A good mark for passing between the Traversaine and the Pierres de la Savatte is, the Buron red beacon turret on with Sablons lighthouse S.E. by S., but this line must be quitted when the Traversaine bank is past as it leads over the Salee flats. Petite Porte Channel. \u2014 If entering the Grande Ranee by the Petite Porte channel, Harbour Island Fort open westward of Grand Jardin lighthouse S. by E., or the lighthouse on with the mill on Dinard point, leads through the clearest passage up to Grand Jardin ; but, to reduce as much as possible the turn round the southern extreme of the Grand Jardin, it is usual to pass through the chain of reefs farther westward. For this purpose, when approaching the entrance, bring the western end of Cezembre island on with the centre of the town of St. Malo S.E. by S., and, when within 2 miles of the island, steer to the southward to bring Grand Jardin and Ballue lighthouses in line S.E. by S. southerly ; this leads between the Grande Hupee and the Rat des Courtis, and northward of the Basse Nord-Est des Portes ; when within 2 cables of the lighthouse, steer to round the Grand Jardin and proceed as before directed."], [130, "108 [Chap. III. CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. After half flood, vessels of considerable draught may use this passage with perfect safety by bringing the leading marks for the Grande Ranee channel on from the offing, Sablons and Ballue lights in line S.E. by S. ; in this case, they will pass over the middle of the Basses Nord-Est des Portes. Grand Jardin lighthouse on with Jeannet windmill S. by W. \u00a3 W. leads between the Bunel rock and the shoals 2 cables westward of the western end of Cezembre ; but, in using this channel, a vessel must edge away to the South-west to round the Grand Jardin as soon as either Parame or St. Hydeuc church steeples open of the south western point of Cezembre. The PETITE CONCHEE CHANNEL is only practicable for vessels of deep draught between half flood and half ebb. Its entrance is 2 cables eastward of the Petite Conchee rock, between the Rousse and Ronfleresse' rocks, where the channel is less than a cable wide. The Petite Conchee is the only rock between Cezembre island and Grande Conchee that does not cover at springs ; the Rousse uncovers 33 feet, and the Ronfleresse 28| feet. Directions. \u2014 The western side of Petit Bey fort seen between La Cite citadel and the little fort on Bechard point, South, leads through the Petite Conchee channel nearly up to the Crapauds du Bey rocks, leaving the Rousse, the Rats, and the Queue des Rats westward ; and, the Ronfleresse, the Pierres aux Normands, and the Roches aux Anglais eastward. A beacon, on a rock which dries 12 feet, marks the centre of the Pierres aux Normands ; and, near the northern end of the Roches aux Anglais is a beacon on a rock which uncovers 11 feet ; the south-eastern part of this latter reef is also marked by a red buoy moored within its edge. The leading mark given passes within 50 yards westward of a sunken rock off the western point of the Ronfleresse, with only 3 feet at low water, springs ; it must be kept on until St. Lunaire mill, or the mound on Bellefard point, opens out southward of Harbour isle ; the vessel will then be 1^ cables westward of the beacon on^the Anglais, and should haul more to the westward to bring the western head of Bizeux islet on with the high rock at the foot of Bechard point bearing S. \\ E. easterly, which mark leads between the Basse Sud-Est des Ouvras and the black buoy of the Crapauds du Bey up to St. Malo road. Crapauds du Bey. \u2014 These rocks, marked by the black buoy on their northern side just mentioned, bear N. by W. 2^- cableB from the Petit Bey fort, they uncover 5^ feet."], [131, "Chap. III.] ST. MALO.\u2014 CONCHEE CHANNELS. 109 GRANDE CONCHEE CHANNEL derives its name from the Grande Conchee rock, and, like that of the Petite Conchee, can only be entered by large vessels between half flood and half ebb, and is chiefly used by those from the north-eastward. The shallowest part, as with- all the channels eastward of Cezembre, is that over the flats in front of Grand and Petit Bey forts. The entrance is bounded on its western side by the Haies de la Conchee, the Rimponiere, and the Grande Conchee ; and, on its eastern side, by the Rousses and the Plate ; its position may be recognised by Grande Conchee fort, which may be seen from a great distance. Haies de la Conchae, Rousses, and Plate Rocks.\u2014 The Haies de la Conchee, 3 cables northward of Grande Conchee fort, is a ridge of high rocks whose summits do not cover. The Rimponiere between the Haies de la Conchee and Grande Conchee, dries 36 feet. The Rousses are rocks, of which one isolated head has only 6 feet water ; the marks for it are, the Grand Chevreuil a little open southward of the guard-house on the inner part of Meinga point ; and, Roche mill on with the eastern gable of the barracks of Petit Bey fort S.S.W. The Plate, half a mile S.E. from Grande Conchee, uncovers 18 feet, and has on it a stone beacon turret 10 feet above the highest tides painted in red and black horizontal bands. Although the sea is nearly always breaking on the Plate, its northern and western sides may be safely approached ; but, off its southern side are two small rocks, of which the Bouton, the most distant, uncovers 12 feet three quarters of a cable S. by W. from the beacon tower. Buoy. \u2014 The Bouton rock is marked by a red buoy moored south ward of it. Several other patches are scattered about the entrance to this channel ; the most dangerous are, the Becfer, the St. Servantine, and the Rat de St. Servan. The Basse de Becfer, with 15 feet water, lies North 2\u00a3 cables from the two north-westernmost heads of the Haies de la Conchee. The Basse de la Conchee, with 22 feet, bears N.E. \u00a3 N. 8 cables from Grande Conchee fort. The Rat de St. Servan with 12 feet, least water, lies E. \u00a3 N. 6^ cables, and the Teto, with 17 feet, the same distance E. \u00a3 S. from Grande Conchee fort. The Rat du Rocher, with 15 feet, is one mile distant E. N. from Grande Conchee fort. St. Servantine is a dangerous isolated rock, which uncovers 2 feet at the lowest tides ; the marks for it are, the summit of the Ronfleresse rock on with the foot of Garde Guerin point W. by"], [132, "110 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. S. \u00a3 S. ; and, St. Hydeuc steeple on with a mill 4 cables S. by E. \u00a3 E. from the steeple. Buoy. \u2014 A red bell buoy'is moored on the south-eastern side of the St. Servantine rock. As a guide to the depth of water over these shoals, it is useful to know that when the Ronfleresse is covered there are at least 25 feet over the St. Servantine ; and, that when the rock on which the Plate beacon turret stands is covered, there are 30 feet over the Rat de St. Servan, 33 feet over the Rat du Rocher, and 34 feet over the Teto rock. Directions. \u2014 When running for the Grande Conchee channel from the eastward, be careful to keep the mound on Garde Guerin point open northward of the Petite Conchee W.S.W. to pass northward of the Basse des Pointus which has 18 feet water, the St. Servantine, and the Rousses. The leading mark to enter the channel is, the Mole des Noires lighthouse touching the eastern side of Grand Bey island S. \u00a3 W. ; this mark leads 1\u00a3 cables eastward of Grande Conchee fort and 2f cables westward of the Plate beacon turret. Keep this mark on until abreast of the Roches aux Anglais, marked by a beacon and buoy as already described ; then haul to the westward round that buoy until the Crapauds buoy is on the port bow, and steer about S.W. by W.^W. between them, with Jeannet mill well open northward of St. Enogat steeple and on with the fall of the high land bordering the eastern side of the Anse des Etetes ; this mark leads northward of the Crapauds du Bey rocks, but it may be necessary to haul a little more westward to clear the buoy. When the westernmost head of the Bizeux is on with the high rock at the foot of Bechard point, steer with these two rocks in line for St. Malo road as before directed. A vessel may, if necessary, pass southward of the Crapauds du Bey rocks by keeping Jeannet mill exactly on with St. Enogat church. A good leading mark for the Grande Conchee channel from the offing, and one easily recognised, is, the south-western corner of La Cite on with the middle of Grand Bey islet S. by W. \u00a3 W. This mark, if followed after entering the channel, has the disadvantage of leading closely past the sunken dangers on its eastern side ; when abreast of the Anglais rocks, a vessel should haul to the westward as before.

MALO.\u2014 CONCHEE AND PETITS POINTUS CHANNELS. Ill in with the southern side of Cezembre island leads northward of the St. Servantine up to the entrance ; then, with the Mole des Noires light opening and shutting in with the eastern side of Grand Bey, steer up the channel. When the high point of Dinard is still a little open westward of the Petit Bey, haul sharply to the westward to pass between the Roches aux Anglais and the Crapauds, observing that when the Mole des Noires light, after having been masked by the Grand Bey, reopens, and is about to be again masked by the Petit Bey, the vessel is nearly on the line of the Crapauds ; and, that when the light re-opens westward of the Petit Bey, she is westward of them and may bear up S.S.W. to enter the eastern limit of the Anse de Sablons green light, and then steer for the anchorage in St. Malo roads. The PETITS POINTUS CHANNEL is the next channel east ward of the Grande Conchee ; its entrance is between the St. Servantine red bell buoy and the Grands Pointus rocks, of which the highest head is 8 feet above high water level and is therefore an excellent mark for the entrance. The leading mark in is, Petit Bey fort a little southward of the guard-house on Dinard point S. W. \u00a3 S. This line leaves on the starboard hand the Plate rock and all the rocky patches named in describing the Grande Conchee channel, the nearest of which, the Bouton, is passed at 2\u00a3 cables ; and, on the port hand, the Basse Tangui of 14 feet, 4 cables N.E. from the Petits Pointus beacon ; the Petits Pointus, of which the highest head, marked by the beacon referred to, uncovers 33 feet ; the Letruns, a shoal 4 cables in extent North and South, which dries from 5 to 7 feet in patches and is marked near its southern edge by a red bell buoy ; the Letrun d'Aval patch, which dries 51 feet ; the Grand Dodehal, which dries 13 feet -and is marked by a beacon nearly 6 cables E. by S. \u00a3 S. from the Roches aux Anglais beacon ; the Petit Dodehal, which dries 3 feet 3 cables westward of the Grand Dodehal ; and, within half a cable of the leading line and between the Grand and Petit Dodehal, a small rock awash at the lowest tides. This channel, as well as all those eastward of Cezembre island, is only practicable for vessels of deep draught between half flood and half ebb. Directions. \u2014 Vessels from the eastward entering by the Petits Pointus channel, when westward of the Basse Grune, should steer with the mound on Garde Guerin point on with Grande Conchee fort W. by S. \u00a3 S. ; this leads between the Grands Pointus and Basse des Pointus, about 3 cables south-eastward of the latter."], [134, "112 [Chap. III. CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. Having arrived within half a mile of the St. Servantine red bell buoy, haul to the southward to bring on the leading mark for the channel just given, viz., Petit Bey fort a little open southward of the guard-house on Dinard point S.W. \\ S., until the mark used when en tering by the Grande Conchee channel comes on \u2014 viz., Jeannet mill well open northward of St. Enogat church steeple and on with the fall of the high land on the eastern side of the Anse des Etetes, when proceed as before directed. By following the leading mark given, a vessel passes a cable west ward of the Basse Tangui, three quarters of a cable westward of the beacon on the Petits Pointus, and 2 cables westward of the Letrun d'Aval. The BIGNE CHANNEL is named after the Bigne rock, three quarters of a mile north-eastward of Varde point, and the highest rock in the vicinity of that point, its summit being 32 feet above the highest tides. This channel is not much frequented, but may be used by vessels of moderate draught with a leading wind, at springs, between half flood and half ebb. At neaps, it may be used by vessels drawing not more than 10 feet at all times of tide. Directions. \u2014 In steering for the entrance of the Bigne channel between the Tintiaux group, north-eastward of Meinga point, and the Rochefort rock black and red beacon turret, bring the Crolante rock, which lies at the foot of Varde point and uncovers 38 feet, on with the western side of Grand Bey fort S.W. by W. \\ W. Run in with this mark on until the Bigne rock bears N.E. by N., or until St. Lunaire mill is on with Bellefard point W. by S. \\ S. southerly, when keep it so until St. Jeannet mill opens northward of St. Enogat steeple ; then proceed as before. The first mark leads a cable south-eastward of the Basse aux Chiens, which lies half a mile south-eastward of the Rochefort and uncovers 3 feet ; about the same distance from the Basse du Durand, lying 6 cables southward of the Rochefort with only one foot water ; and, about half a cable south-eastward of the Petite Bigne, marked by a beacon at its eastern end. On the other hand, it leads within half a cable of the reef extending from the Durand, ef which some rocks dry 12 feet ; and, at a greater distance outside the Aiguillon and Graine-de-Lin rocks, the former uncovering 21 feet, the latter 12 feet. The second mark leads a cable northward of the Crolante and of the Cancalaise, a little rocky ridge which uncovers 9 feet ; and, about half a cable southward of the red bell buoy off the southern end of the Letruns."], [135, "Chap. III.] ST. MALO.\u2014 BIGNE CHANNEL.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. 113 The third mark leads northward of the Crapauds du Bey as on enter ing by the Grande Conchee or Petits Pointus channels, but leads very close to the rock awash north-eastward of the Petit Dodehal. It is useful to know that when the Petite Bigne covers, there are more than 19 feet over the tail of the shoal extending northward from Grand Bey fort, which is the shoalest part of this channel. Vessels sometimes enter the Bigne channel with St. Malo church on with the Bigne rock S.W. \\ W., and run in on the eastern side of the Rochefort until within a quarter of a mile of the Bigne, then edge away southward, to round the Petite Bigne at a safe distance, and then bring on the leading marks already given, and proceed as before. The tides in this channel between St. Malo and Varde point never have much strength ; they run strongly however north-eastward of that point. To St. Malo from the Westward.\u2014 When bound to St. Malo from the westward, with southerly winds, Ushant and the French coast may be kept aboard ; but, with northerly winds and at night, a prudent distance should be maintained off-shore until the fixed and flashing light on the Sept-iles, and the fixed light on the Heaux rocks, are made out. With the assistance of these lights, a position may be obtained about 4 miles northward of the Heaux, from whence a S.E. E. course for about 33 miles, following the directions at page 47, leads northward of the Roc'h-ar-Bel and Horaine ledge, and crosses the meridian of cape Frehel about 6 miles northward of the cape. The vessel is then in a good position to run for the entrance of the Ranee through the Decolle passage or Grande Porte channel, according to the state of the wind and tide. This route may be followed either with the flood or against the ebb with the wind from N.N.E. round by West to South, but if between S.W. and South it is better to give cape Frehel a closer berth. With a fresh leading wind, a sailing vessel passing the meridian of Heaux lighthouse at the commencement of the flood, or 5 hours before high water at St. Malo, should enter the Ranee by high water, the distance being about 43 miles ; but, with a foul wind, it takes two flood tides to make the passage.\" With a beating wind, make short tacks in sight of Heaux light house until the commencement of the flood, then stretch into the channel between the Barnouic and Roc'h-ar-Bel. The boards in this channel should not exceed 2 miles in length, but when eastward of the Horaine they may be extended to 7 or 8 miles. By following A 2771. Wt. 7242. H"], [136, "[Chap. HI. 114 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. these directions, cape Frehel should be made towards the latter part of the flood, and the vessel may anchor or make short tacks under shelter of the cape during the ebb ; or, if not so far to windward, she may anchor in the rade d'Erqui, see page 82. Weigh again when the flood makes, and work up so as to reach, if possible by about half flood, one of the entrance channels to the Ranee. To St. Malo through Grand Ruet Passage.\u2014 The channel between the Roches-Douvres on the West, and Guernsey, Jersey, and the Minquiers ledge on the East, called by the French pilots the Grand Ruet, would seem from its great breath to offer a safe and easy route to St. Malo or Granville ; the streams, however, run through and across it with such velocity at springs, that, during westerly winds, with stream and wind in the same direction, a sailing vessel runs great risk of being drifted between the islands and dangers in their vicinity ; and, if surprised by fog or night, the danger is imminent, the constant changes in the set of the stream making the dead reckoning unreliable. At springs, with a westerly wind and flood tide, ships should keep well to the westward, make the coast of France about the Sept-iles, and proceed southward of the Barnouic ledge, as already described ; but, at neaps, with a steady northerly wind irrespective of tide, or, at springs, with an ebb tide and a westerly wind, a vessel may use this channel with due care as follows : \u2014 With a steady westerly wind, and being about 8 miles W.S.W. of the Hanois light off the western endof Guernsey, at the commence ment of the ebb or 2\\ hours after high water at St. Malo, steer S. \\ E. for about 38 miles, or until within 6 or 8 miles N.W. by N. of cape Frehel,\" when St. Malo may be steered for as before directed. This course leads about 4^ miles eastward of the Roches-Douvres lighthouse, which should be sighted to correct the reckoning ; 5\u00a3 miles eastward of the Barnouic ledge ; and, 9^ miles westward of the Minquiers. During nearly the whole of this run, the wind being on the starboard side counteracts the effect of the stream, which, for the first four hours will be on the port beam, the fifth hour a little on the bow, and at last on the starboard beam, the flood beginning earlier as the coast is neared. To St. Malo through the D^route Passage.\u2014 The shortest and best route from cape de la Hague to St. Malo, with fresh leading winds, is through the Race of Alderney,see pages 346-348, and between Jersey and Serk through the Deroute passage, see page 265, the"], [137, "Chap. III.] ST. MALO BY GRAND RUET AND COTENTIN PASSAGES. 115 distance being about 75 miles ; it should not be used, however, by strangers at night during light winds or in thick weather. To take this route under the most advantageous circumstances, endeavour to enter the Race on the slack or last of the north-eastern stream, which is about 4 hours after high water at St. Malo. Having cleared the Race, steer about S.W. to enter the Deroute passage in mid-channel, and to ensure passing south-eastward of the Blanchard rock. This distance being run in about 2^ or 3 hours, or about the time of low water at St. Malo, continue the course so as to be in a good position westward of the meridian of the Minquiers at the first of the flood. This stream is felt more as the vessel advances southward ; it is therefore most necessary to determine by correct bearings the course to be steered, and to pay strict attention to the directions given at page 136, in passing those dangers. When clear of the Minquiers, steer for cape Frehel where pilots are always on the look out. To St. Malo through the Contentin Passage.\u2014 Full directions are given at pages 186-192 for this passage when bound to Granville ; the same directions should be followed for St. Malo until the vessel has arrived within 4 or 5 miles of the beacon turret on the Etat or Petite Canue, a remarkable rock on the northern edge of the Chausey group, which group is fully described in the following chapter, when she should keep to the westward so as to round the north-western part of the group about 1^ miles distant. When abreast of the Rondes de l'Ouest, a rocky ridge forming the western end of the group, steer S.W. or more southerly, keeping within 3 miles of the rocks until the ruins of the old castle on Grande lie open southward of the Corbiere, the high and remarkable rock at the south-western extreme of the Chausey group, E. by S. \u00a3 S.; then steer about S.W. S. for one of the channels into the Ranee. Great care must be taken to make proper allowance for the set of the tidal stream, which, in clear weather, can easily be done by frequent bearings of objects on the Chausey isles. At Night, when Chausey light is sighted, steer for it on a S.W. \u00a3 S. bearing until within 2 miles of the Chausey group, when Granville light will bear S.S.E. % E.; then keep to the westward so as to round the rocks at that distance. When abreast of the western end of the group, haul to the southward, taking care not to approach the rocks within 2 miles ; and, if the night is clear, by the time the light bears E. by N. both the Herpin and Grand Jardin lights will H 2"], [138, "116 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. be in sight. By the aid of these two, and of the St. Malo leading lights, the port may be entered at once by the directions already given ; or, if preferred, a position may be maintained off the port to await daylight. From St. Malo through Contentin Passage.\u2014 Vessels leaving St. Malo and intending to take this route, should so time their departure as to enable them to enter the Contentin passage with the first of the north-eastern stream, which makes 3J hours before high water at St. Malo. From one mile northward of the Grande Conchee, steer about N.E. I E. ; this line passes about 2 miles north-westward of the Rochefort beacon turret, and 4 miles south-eastward of the Sauvages, due allowance being made for tide. When within 3 or 4 miles of the Corbiere rock, steer to pass about 1^ miles westward of the Rondes de l'Ouest, clear of Corbiere bank. Round the north-western end of the group at the same distance, passing about 2 miles south-eastward of the Ardentes ; and, when the semaphore on the summit of Gros-Mont is on with the Enseigne beacon tower S. by W. steer to the eastward to bring the Etat and Huguenans beacon towers in line S. by W. \\ W. westerly ; this mark on astern leads northward between the Shamrock knoll and the Marie ledge, when follow the directions given at page 190, and endeavour to run through the Race of Alderney with the last of the south-western stream. If after the first quarter flood, and unable to weather the western end of the Chausey group, bear up and pass round the eastern end, where, by that time, there will be a good rise of tide over the numerous shallow patches by which that part of the channel is encumbered, see pages 152-154. Granville church on with the northernmost chimney of the south-western barrack keeps a vessel half a mile northward of the Videcoq rock, marked by a red and black bell buoy ; and, Coutances cathedral on with Mont Martin church N.E. by E. \u00a3 E. leads between the Haguet and Admiralty banks, but over and amongst patches with as little as 3 feet at low water, springs, when southward of the latter. From St. Malo through the D^route Passage.\u2014 Vessels of deep draught bound eastward, leave St. Malo road when the flood begins to slack ; and, with a fair wind, when clear of the Ranee, they may adopt the Grand Ruet passage, see page 114 ; but, with the wind between South and West, the distance may be much shortened by running through the Deroute passage and the Race of"], [139, "Chap. III.] DIRECTIONS FROM ST. MALO. \u2014 ROTENEUF. 117 Alderney. A vessel averaging 7 knots should reach the middle of this passage in 6 hours after leaving St. Malo, and from thence, steering for the Race with a fresh fair wind, may stem the remainder of the south-western stream. The Race would then be entered a little after the commencement of the north-eastern stream. French coasters generally adopt this route, and to ensure entering the Race on the slack or last of the south-western stream, they sometimes wait for a leading wind at anchor under the ile des Ehbiens. The Rochefort rock lies 1% miles north-westward of Meinga point, abreast of the little harbour of Roteneuf, and, with the Platier ledge which dries 3 feet, forms a rocky group 2\u00a3 cables long E.N.E. and W.S.W. and one cable wide. The highest head of the Rochefort shows at about 2 hours' ebb, uncovers 34 feet at the lowest tides, and does not cover at neaps. It is marked by a tower of masonry 13 feet above high water, painted with black and red bands, and surmounted by a ball. The marks for it are, the guard-house on the summit of Varde point its own breadth open westward of the Bigne S.W. \u00a3 S. ; and, St. Vincent mill on with the western bluff of Benard point, South. The mound on Garde Guerin point open northward of Grande Conchee isle leads northward of the Rochefort ; and, Parame church on with the Bigne leads westward. ROTENEUF.\u2014 This little harbour, about 4 miles eastward of St. Malo and midway between Varde and Meinga points, is about three-quarters of a mile wide and half a mile deep, but it is choked with sand, over which the tide only begins to rise at half flood ; the approach also is rendered dangerous by several rocks which cover. Vessels of 15 or 16 feet draught may beach within it at high water, springs, but they must keep within a quarter of a cable of Benard point, the eastern point of entrance, when passing it. Vessels ground and lay up for the winter in the creek eastward of this point, where the bottom is everywhere of sand and the shelter excellent. A remarkable tree open eastward of a large house leads up to the entrance of the harbour, passing eastward of the Rochefort and westward of the Hautieux and Guimereux rocks ; the Hautieux uncover 25 feet, the Guimereux, lying between the Hautieux and Benard point, 23 feet. Three off-lying rocks, always covered and very dangerous to deep vessels, lie eastward of the Rochefort ; they are the Basse Rault, Basse Grune, and Basse du Nid."], [140, "[Chap. III. 118 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. Basse Rault.\u2014 This rocky head lies 1% miles E. by N. \\ N. from Rochefort beacon turret ; N. by E. \u00a3 E. 1\\ miles from Meinga point ; and, W. by N. \\ N. northerly 4\u00a3 miles from Pierre de Herpin light house. It has only 16 feet water, with from 9 to 10 fathoms round it, and should be carefully avoided at low water by vessels of deep draught, as also by small craft when it blows hard as it then causes a great swell. The marks for the Rault are, the mound on Garde Guerin point a little open southward of the Rochefort beacon turret W. by S. \\ S. southerly ; and, the eastern slope of Meinga point almost shutting in Terquete mill. The mound on Garde Guerin point on with Grande Conchee fort W. by S. \u00a3 S. leads northward ; and, Mont St. Michel on with the Herpin rock S.E. \\ E. leads well north-eastward. Basse Grune is a dangerous isolated rock, with only 7 feet on it and from 10 to 12 fathoms close around, lying N.E. \\ E. 3^ miles from Meinga point ; and, N.W. \\ W. 3^ miles from Pierre de Herpin lighthouse. It occasions great overfalls even in moderate weather, and is much in the way of vessels from the westward bound to Granville or Cancale road. The marks for it are, Rochefort beacon turret a little southward of the mound on Garde Guerin point W. by S. g S. southerly ; Granville church perceptibly open south ward of Granville lighthouse ; and, Cancale church its own length open westward of the eastern Haut-Bout mill S. \\ E. Granville church in sight northward of Granville lighthouse E. \\ N. leads well northward of the Basse Grune ; Garde Guerin mound on with Grande Conchee fort leads half a mile north-westward ; Mont St. Michel on with the Herpin rock S.E.

In moderate weather, vessels of any draught may pass between the Grune and the Nid at all times by keeping Mont St. Michel on with the Herpin rock bearing S.E. \\ E. The lights of cape Frehel, Pierre de Herpin, Granville, and Chausey are all visible from the Basse Grune ; from it, cape Frehel light bears W. \\ N. 17 miles, Granville light E. \\ N. 12 miles, and Chausey light N.E. \\ N. 7f miles.

Mont St. Michel on with the Herpin rock S.E. \\ E. leads well northward of it. When the Pierre de Herpin rock, on which the lighthouse stands, is covered, there are at least 37 feet water over the Grune, and 46 feet over both the Rault and Nid. The TINTIAUX are a group of rocks about 1\u00a3 miles long E.S.E. and W.N.W., and half a mile broad, their western end lying 4 cables north-eastward of Meinga point ; most of the rocks appear at 4 hours ebb, and the highest, near the centre of the group, dry about 30 feet at low water, springs, and do not cover at neaps. Rochefort beacon turret on with cape Frehel lighthouse, or on with Grande Conchee fort, leads northward ; and, Duguesclin fort bearing S.S.W., or Haut-Bout eastern mill on with the guard-house on Verger point, the eastern point of the first sandy beach westward of Grouin point, leads eastward. Tintiaux Passage, between the Tintiaux and the land, is used by coasting vessels with southerly winds ; the tide runs very strongly through it, but follows the direction of the channel. The leading mark when coming from the eastward is, the Bigne rock midway between Grand Jardin lighthouse and the south-western point of Cezembre isle, West ; this leads 100 yards southward of all the Tintiaux, and between them and the northern rock of the Cadins, which dries 3 feet. Give Meinga point a berth of a quarter of a mile in passing, and then run out between the Tintiaux and the Basse aux Chiens, with St. Vincent mill, on the heights at the head of Roteneuf harbour, touching the eastern part of the high land of Benard ; or, if entering St. Malo, bring the leading marks on for the Bigne channel, see page 112, if the tide is sufficiently high to take that channel. The Coast. \u2014 Meinga point, 3\u00a3 miles westward of Grouin point, is very remarkable ; it is nearly as high as cape Frehel, is narrow and steep on all sides, and extends in a slope more than half a mile northward. Between it and Grouin point, the coast presents nothing worthy of notice with the exception of the small bay between Nez and Nid points, where, in its south-eastern part, is a sandy beach defended by Fort Duguesclin. This fort stands 3 cables westward of Nid point on a rocky islet joined with the shore at low water by a ridge of rocks. There is also a semaphore station at point Besnard close by."], [142, "[Chap. III. 120 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. Vessels of deep draught should keep well off-shore between points Meinga and Grouin ; indeed, as previously stated, the navigation of this coast is so fraught with danger, both from its numerous rocks and strong tides, that the safety of his vessel calls for the utmost vigilance on the part of the mariner. POINTE de GROUIN, the western point of Mont St. Michel bay, is high, rocky, and precipitous on its north-western and south eastern sides, but forms a narrow slope towards the N.E. The sudden change in the direction of the coast at this point is very remarkable, and makes it easy of recognition at a great distance in the offing. Near its extreme is a semaphore, and farther southward the two windmills of Haut-Bout. North-westward of Grouin point and peninsula are many rocky patches from half a mile to one mile from the shore ; and, on its eastern side, Landes island, with the Herpin, Pierre de Herpin, Fille rock, and a few shoal patches extending 2 miles eastward of Grouin point, form a broken rocky barrier through which vessels pass when seeking shelter in Cancale road or in the anchorage off La Houle. He des Landes. \u2014 This high, narrow, rocky islet, steep on all sides and inaccessible when there is any swell on, lies 2 cables eastward of Grouin point, and, at high water, is about 4 cables long N.E. and S.W. and about a cable wide ; but, at low tide, it is lengthened 3 cables to the N.N.E. by some rocks then high above water and by others which are covered. Its direction is nearly parallel with the shore, from which it is separated by a channel called the Vieille Riviere, only 164 yards wide at its narrowest part, through which, at springs, the stream runs 6 knots. The eastern side is steep-to from end to end, there being from 18 to 20 feet water alongside the rocks. On the north-eastern part of the island .are the ruins of a fort and guard-house. The Pignonet rock, with only 10-jj feet, lies in mid-channel between the north-eastern extreme of Landes island and the Herpin rock. The Herpin rock is a high pyramid rock about 66 feet above the level of high water, springs, and its base a cable in diameter at low water. It bears E.N.E. three quarters of a mile from Grouin point, and is nearly 2 cables from the north-eastern extreme of Landes island ; its shape, great height, and isolated ' position, render it a remarkable object from a great distance."], [143, "Chap. III.] POINTE DE GROUIN. \u2014 PIERRE DE HERPIN. 121 Coasters find shelter under this rock with the wind from West round by South to East. There is also good anchorage in from 7 to 9 fathoms with the rock bearing N.W. \u00a3 W. from 1 to 1^ miles ; the ground, however, so far out, is rather coarse. PIERRE de HERPIN.\u2014 The highest head of this small rocky ridge, on which stands the lighthouse, uncovers 32 feet, and bears N.E. by E. \\ E. three quarters of a mile from the Herpin rock. At springs, it begins to show at about one third ebb ; at neaps, it does not cover. Another rocky ridge, with from 22 to 24 feet water, lies S. by E. a quarter of a mile from the Pierre de Herpin. LIGHT. \u2014 From a circular lighthouse, 81 feet in height, on the Pierre de Herpin, at 61 feet above the level of high water, is exhibited a light alternately fixed white and flashing green for successive periods of SO seconds. \u2022 The fixed white light is visible at 17 miles; the flashing green light at 15 miles. From this lighthouse, cape Frehel light bears W. by N. 19^ miles ; the Minquiers light-vessel N.W. 21 miles ; and, Granville light, pointe du Roc, E. by N. \u00a3 N. 10 miles. The passage between the Pierre de Herpin and the Herpin rock, called the Grand Ruet, is the principal entrance to Cancale road from the North-west ; but, the Basse du Milieu, a shoal with only 4 feet W. | S. 2\u00a7 cables from the lighthouse, narrows the passage to 4 cables between it and the Herpin rock ; this passage is otherwise deep enough for vessels of any draught at all times. They should, however, pass within a cable of the Herpin on the flood, as this stream sets strongly over the Basse du Milieu and Pierre de Herpin ; the flood begins to make through the passage about 5\u00a3 hours before high water at St. Malo or Granville, and as it runs S.E. and E.S.E. there is no danger of being drifted over the Banchets. The Fille rock, E.N.E. 3 cables from Pierre de Herpin light house, is the easternmost of these dangers ; it uncovers 11 feet at the lowest tides. From it, Grouin point bears W.S.W. 2 miles ; the summit of the Herpin rock is on with the northern head of the Pierre de Herpin ; and, Bigne rock appears between the Grand Chevreuil, half hidden by point Meinga, and Cezembre island. Buoy. \u2014 A bell buoy, with red and black bands, marks this danger on its northern side. When the Pierre de Herpin covers, there are 19^ feet on the Fille, and a vessel is northward of both when Grouin point is open"], [144, "122 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. northward of the Herpin rock, and southward when the point is open southward of the Herpin. Cape Frehel on with the Herpin also leads southward. There are 8\u00a3 fathoms in the passage between the Pierre de Herpin and the Fille, and it may be safely used by keeping from 1^ to 2^ cables from the lighthouse ; but, this passage places a vessel too much to leeward if seeking shelter from strong westerly winds in Cancale road. Bane des Renardieres, of from 6 to 7^ fathoms, sand and shells, bears N.N.W. W. 1\u00a3 miles from the Herpin rock ; it is only a cable broad and half a mile in length N. by W. and S. by E., and lying nearly across the streams it causes a heavy sea on a weather tide. From its shoalest part at the southern end, the fort near Varde point appears midway between Grand and Petit Cheyreuil W. by S. f S. ; and, the Herpin rock is on with the north-eastern extreme of Pointe de Gogre, Mont *St. Michel bay. South-eastward of Grouin point, between it and point de la Chaine, is the Grande rade de Cancale, already referred to and presently described. Besides the dangers extending eastward from Grouin point, of which the Fille rock is the most eastern, there are, on the western side of the road, the Bane de Chatry ; on the northern side, the Banchets shoal ; and, on the eastern and southern sides, the Brehaut, Corbieres, ile de Rimains, and other rocks in-shore, of which the principal are the Petit Rimains and the Chatellier, above water ; a large rock near Chaine point which uncovers 22 feet and is marked by a beacon ; and, the Thomen rock within low water mark off La Houle, marked by two beacons on its northern heads. The southern head having been levelled has no beacon. Bane de Chatry runs parallel with the shore and bounds Cancale road on the West ; it has from 6 to 9 feet for a distance of half a mile on its shoalest parts, and is joined to the coast at Chaine point by a bed of sand, over which there are 11 or 12 feet ; its northern end is abreast of a small creek named port Mer, leaving between it and the shallows extending from the shore the Fosse de Chatry or Chatry deep, a swashway 3 cables wide, in which the depths are from 26 to 32 feet. From the northern part of the bank, Haut-Bout windmill is on with the northern declivity of Chatry point ; and, from its eastern edge, the Cormorandiere and the Hubert, two remarkable rocks adjoining Rimains island, are in line ; the Cormorandiere, at the"], [145, "Chap. III.] DANGERS OFF THE RADE DE CANCALE. 123 northern extreme of the island, is high and pointed ; the Hubert, about three quarters of a cable eastward of the fort, is wedge shaped- The BANCHETS.\u2014 This bank of sand and broken shells of from 10 to 24 feet water is in the fairway of the entrance to Cancale road, 3 cables northward of the Corbieres bank, and E.S.E. three quarters of a mile from the old fort on Landes island ; together with the small knoll of 23Jj feet at 2 cables on its north-western side, it is dangerous to vessels of deep draught at low water, springs. The bank is 5^ cables long N. by W. and S. by E. ; the shoalest parts form two small ridges parallel to each other, and athwart the direction of the streams. On the north-western ridge are 17 feet, and only 10 feet on the highest part of the other, near the eastern part of the bank. The marks for the 10-feet ridge are, the steep point of Chateau Richeux open 1\u00b0 eastward of Chaine point ; and, the slope of Grouin point open the same distance northward of the guard-house on Landes island. The sand forming this bank is said not to shift, but there is reason to think that the depths often change during strong gales. The mark for the small knoll of 23^ feet water is, Haut-Bout mill on with the northern point of port Mer bay. The mill just open southward of the point leads between this knoll and the Banchets ; and, on with the summit of the same point leads northward of the knoll. There are two other knolls, with 24 and 25 feet water, a cable northward of the Banchets. The Brehaut is an extensive flat of sand and rock south-eastward of the Banchets and half a mile eastward of the northern part of Corbieres bank ; the soundings are from 7 to 10 fathoms, but as the ground is very foul it should be avoided. Bane des Corbieres, bounding Cancale road eastward, is about H miles long from the line of Haut-Bout windmill on with the northern declivity of Chatry point, to the same windmill on with the Cormorandiere rock ; it is about half a mile wide and is joined to the sandy shore of Mont St.\" Michel bay by flats on which the depth decreases gradually from 20 to 8 feet, and from thence to the sands which dry. The general depths on this bank are from 2 to 4 fathoms, but a small patch about 3 cables long North and South with only 10 feet water rises on its southern part, about half a mile eastward of the fort on Rimains island. From the northern end of this patch, the guard-house on Chaine point is on with Cancale church steeple ; and,"], [146, "124 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. from the southern end, the steeple is between the Chatellier rock and Petit Rimains islet, which joins the northern end of that rock at low water. GRANDE RADE de CANCALE.\u2014 This excellent anchorage is northward of Rimains island, three quarters of a mile from the shore between Chatry and Corbieres banks ; it affords good shelter for ships of deep draught during westerly winds. A vessel should moor North and South with open hawse to the westward, and the best holding ground is with the Cormorandiere rock seen between Rimains island and the Hubert rock ; its eastern limit is, the Cormorandiere touching the eastern side of the fort on Rimains ; and, its northern limit, Haut-Bout mill on with the middle of Portz Picain, a small white sandy beach close southward of Chatry point. North easterly winds sometimes cause a swell, but vessels are seldom obliged by shifts of wind to weigh suddenly at this anchorage. There is also good holding ground in the southern part of the road in from 26 to 30 feet, clay and mud, about 2 cables eastward of Rimains island, with Cancale church steeple on with the middle of Rimains fort ; and, Grouin point a little open westward of Landes island. A vessel under 10 feet draught may anchor southward of Rimains island, with that island bearing North half a mile distant ; in running for this anchorage at low water, keep within a quarter of a mile of the island, to avoid the 10-feet patch on the Corbieres bank. At this anchorage, if unable to ride out heavy weather from the north-eastward, take the top of high water and run aground on the mud southward of Cancale church with good sail on ; here both vessel and crew will be saved. Buoy. \u2014 A large mooring buoy is placed about 5 cables S.S.W. h W. from the southern end of Rimains island ; there are only 4 feet water at this spot at low water, springs. Anchorage East of Corbieres Bank.\u2014 Vessels of deep draught sometimes anchor eastward of Corbieres bank, but they are less sheltered than in Cancale road and more exposed to north-easterly winds, which, when strong, throw in a heavy sea, causing vessels to roll heavily on a weather tide. The anchoring ground extends south ward from the line of Haut-Bout mill on with Portz Picain to that of Cancale church steeple on with the southern side of Chatellier rock. The best berth is in from 6 to 7 fathoms, blue tenacious clay, with Dol church steeple on with the foot of the eastern slope of Mont Dol : and, Cancale church steeple between the Chatellier and the fort on"], [147, "Chap. III.] GRANDE RADE DE CANCALE. \u2014 FOSSE DE CHATRY. 125 Rimains. This position is 1\u00a3 miles outside Rimains island, but the Corbieres prevents a nearer approach, consequently that island affords but little shelter from the westward. Vessels remaining any length of time at this anchorage should sight their anchors occasionally, or they bury themselves deeply and are difficult to weigh. Merchant vessels generally prefer anchoring southward of the Corbieres bank, where the holding ground is good and the depth from 19 to 22 feet. The best birth is close southward of the line of Haut-Bout mill on with the Cormorandiere rock N.W. westerly, or with the mill between the fort and the northern point of Rimains island, but the safest position is in the southern part of Cancale road. Anchorage in Fosse de Chatry. \u2014 Vessels of moderate draught may anchor here in from 26 to 32 feet, with Haut-Bout mill on with Portz Picain ; and, Mont Dol on with the eastern point of Petit Rimains, the little island just northward of the Chatellier rock. This is a good anchorage during neaps, but, at springs, the streams run from 4 to 5 knots. Small craft may anchor a little more in-shore, but not west ward of the line of Mont Dol touching the western side of the Chatellier. Vessels that can take the ground are well sheltered with the wind from N.E. round by North and West to S.S.W. on the deposit of soft mud which borders the northern part of the little bay of port Mer. LIGHT. \u2014 On Fenetre rock, port of Houle, Cancale, a fixed red light, visible 6 miles, is shown from a circular tower at 33 feet above high water. The Fenetre rock is connected with the shore by a short pier above the level of high water, which, for the protection of coasters using the port, has lately been considerably lengthened with an elbow to the westward. La Houle, the port of Cancale, has a large fishing industry and valuable oyster beds ; its trade otherwise is insignificant, Its beaching places westward of the Fenetre are good and safe for small craft, The town of Cancale stands on the cliffs and La Houle at their feet ; their united population is about 6,000. St. Malo is about 8 miles distant by road. Directions. \u2014 When running from the westward for Cancale road from a position about 2 miles N.N.E. from Cezembre island, steer E. by N., keeping the mound on Garde Guerin point open northward of Grande Conchee fort, until Mont St. Michel opens of Grouin point ;"], [148, "[Chap. III. 126 CAPE FREHEL TO GRAVILLE. then haul up for it, and keep the Mont on with the Herpin rock bearing S.E. \\ E. ; this leads between the Grune and Nid shoals. When within about half a mile of the Herpin rock, steer through the Grand Ruet, passing only a cable eastward of the rock if the flood is run ning, as that stream sets strongly over the Basse du Milieu and Pierre de Herpin ; and, from thence, haul to the southward for the road. The passages between Grouin point and Landes island, called the Petit Ruet, and that between the north-eastern extreme of Landes island and the Herpin are too dangerous to attempt without a pilot. BAIE DU MONT ST. MICHEL, between Grouin and Champeaux points which bear E. \u00a3 S.-and W. \u00a3 N. from each other distant 10| miles, is much exposed to north-westerly and northerly winds ; the anchorages, however, off Cancale and La Houle in the north-western part of the bay, as just described, afford excellent shelter against westerly winds. The head of the bay falls back a great distance south-eastward, and nearly three fourths of it is occupied by an immense bank of sand which dries at low water. The Coast. \u2014 On the western side of the bay the land is high for the space of 4 miles from Grouin to Chateau Richeux point, and the coast generally steep. The low lands, called the marsh of Dol, begin at Chateau Richeux point and extend 15 miles eastward to the mouth of the river Couesnon, the course of which separates the department of Ile-et-Vilaine from that of La Manche. A strong dyke protects this marsh from the invasion of the sea, its surface being in several places below the level of high spring tides. The only remarkable rise on this part of the coast is the small isolated hill named Mont Dol, and a chain of hills, which, seen from the northward, seem to form a long promontory, of which the western extreme is known locally as point de Gogre. Mont Dol rises from the midst of the marsh land 6 miles south-eastward of Chateau Richeux point, and, on its flat top stands a windmill, a semaphore and a few cottages. Point de Gogre is the nearest point to the sea of the chain of hills about three quarters of a mile inland between Mont Dol and the river Couesnon. The little- harbour of Vivier is at the mouth of the river Guyoul S | E. about 7 miles from Grouin point ; it can only be entered by the smallest coasters having good pilots. Mont Dol semaphore bearing S. \\ W. leads up to it, There is a small quay, alongside of which vessels lie to load or unload."], [149, "Chap. III.] MONT ST. MICHEL BAY. \u2014 CHAMPEAUX POINT. 127 . Small vessels can ascend the river Couesnon, at springs, as far as the town of Pontorson, but the navigation is difficult and seldom attempted. The entrance channel through the sands commences at the western foot of Mont St. Michel. Mont St. Michel and Tombelaine islet, rising from the sands in the eastern part of the bay, form by far the most remarkable objects on this part of the coast. Mont St. Michel is a pyramidal block of granite 4 cables in diameter, which at the highest tides is completely surrounded, but from which at low water the sea recedes to a great distance, leaving dry sands for about 6 miles. Its summit is surmounted by large buildings and an ancient abbey church, of which the steeples are 420 feet above the level of the beach. It bears South nearly 7 miles from Champeaux point, and in appearance strongly resembles Mount St. Michael in Cornwall. Harbour Lights. \u2014 On the western side of Mont St. Michel, from the Gabriel watch tower, at 41 feet above high water and 54 feet above the ground, is exhibited a fixed red light visible 6 miles through an arc of 180\u00b0. The light is shown only from the time the tide arrives at the foot of the Mont, 2 hours before high water, until H hours ebb. A fixed green light is shown from the eastern point of entrance to the Couesnon river, about 1,100 yards from the Mont. This light is not exhibited unless a vessel is expected. The two lights indicate the direction of the chenal de Couesnon. The Tombelaine is a barren islet almost as large as Mont St. Michel but much lower. It bears N. by E. \\ E. 1\u00a3 miles from the Mont, and, when seen from the northward or southward, has the appearance of a crushed pyramid inclining to the eastward. A deep sandy bight lies eastward of Mont St. Michel and Tombelaine, from the northern shore of which Tombelaine is distant 1\u00a3 miles. The shore from thence continues very low for about 3 miles farther north ward, until near Champeaux point, when it begins to rise. CHAMPEAUX POINT is the eastern point of Mont St. Michel bay ; from it, pointe du Roc, Granville, bears North a little easterly 5\u00a3 miles. It is a bluff and almost perpendicular headland, un approachable from seaward on account of the broad flats which dry out a long way from the shore, but very useful as a landmark, especially for vessels navigating between Chausey and Granville, or bound northward by the Cotentin channel."], [150, "128 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. III. Between Champeaux point and Granville the coast curves slightly to the eastward and is generally of moderate height ; but, in some places it is low, sandy and dangerous to approach with westerly winds, being bordered by a sand-bank interspersed with flat rocks, which extend a mile from the shore. As Granville is approached, these dangers become more marked, but, as they especially concern the pilotage of that port, a full description of them is given in the next chapter."], [151, "129 CHAPTER IV. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE, INCLUDING PLATEAU DES MINQUIERS AND ILES CHAUSEY.* VARIATION in 1888. lies Chausey 17\u00b0 30' W. 18\u00b0 0' W. Cape de la Hague Before proceeding to a description of Granville and the adjacent shore, it will be well to give a detailed account of the vast beds of rocks and islets in the offing, which, in conjunction with the Channel islands to the northward, render the navigation and all approach to the ports on this coast so exceptionally dangerous. PLATEAU des MINQUIERS, situated 9 miles southward of Jersey, and 13 miles from the nearest French land both southward and eastward of it, is a tangled mass of reefs 16 miles long East and West, by 8 miles broad. The most dangerous part occupies a space near the middle, about 7 miles long East and West, by 4 miles broad. The masses of rock at this part lie closer together in ridges and are more elevated, a large number being generally awash at high water ; only a few scattered rocks rise from 10 to 20 feet above that level. These rocky groups are generally connected by extensive banks of shingle, gravel, and sand. There are, however, some narrow tortuous channels through this part of the reef, but from the strength of the tides and absence of good marks, the pilotage is too difficult for any but the fishermen by whom they are frequented. The whole of the sunken part of this reef, eastward, is studded w*ith dangerous rocks, of which some dry 7 feet at low water, but a far greater number are either just awash or have not more than from 3 to 6 feet over them at that time. The sunken part of the western end of the reef has comparatively few dangers, and at that part of the plateau there is some good clear ground for anchorage in 10 or 12 fathoms, so that a vessel set within the edge may anchor and remain until the turn of the stream favours her drifting away from it again. The. north-western rocky mass of the high part is called the Pipette group ; it is remarkable from having several flat-topped pillar-like * See Admiralty Chart : \u2014 Channel islands and coast of France. No. 2,669 a b ; scale m = 0-5 inch. A 2771. Wt. 7242. I"], [152, "130 [Chap. IV. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. rocks, and is a spot most fatal to shipping, more wrecks having taken place here than ajt any other part of the reef. The strength of the flood sets directly on it, and the stream is partially divided by it. Of the rocks which never cover, the most remarkable in order of magnitude are, Maitresse ile, Maisons, Haute Grune, Faucheurs, Figuier, Red Frouquie, Blanc roque, Calfateurs, Rocher du Sud, Grand Vascelin, and Pipette rocks. MINQUIERS LIGHT-VESSEL lies S.S.W. \u00a3 W. 1\u00a3 miles from the Brisants du Sud, at the south-western extreme of the Minquiers reef, in 21 fathoms water. The vessel is painted black, has two masts with a ball at each mast-head by day, and exhibits two fixed white lights, one 26 and the other 39 feet above the level of the sea ; in fine weather, the lights are visible 9 and 11 miles respectively, but in bad weather they cannot be shown at a greater elevation than to command a range of 8 miles. Fog Sig'nal. \u2014 During foggy weather a bell is sounded for one minute at intervals of three minutes. If an approaching vessel sounds her bell continuously, the fog bell of the light-vessel is also sounded continuously. (See note, page 10.) Maitresse ile, near the south-eastern side of the high middle part of the reef before referred to, is the largest islet of the group, although barely a cable long and half a cable wide ; it is also the highest, although only 25 feet above high water. There is a little soil on this islet and some faint traces of vegetation, but it is quite destitute of fuel or subsistance of any kind, nor is there any fresh water except that deposited in the interstices of the rocks by rain. Stone was formerly quarried from the western part of the ile and used in the construction of Fort Regent, St. Helier. In 1869 there were 17 small stone houses or huts on the islet belonging to the natives of La Roque point, Jersey, who, during the summer season, which is 8 months of the year, fish over all parts of the Minquiers reef. In August 1888, the condition of the ile was very similar, the number of houses being then 19, but one was without a roof ; the other 18 houses were all occupied by the Jersey fisher men, except one which had for some months been let to two French men engaged in making Hydrographic observations for their government. From 16 to 18 boats were engaged in the lobster fishery, each boat containing 2 men ; the boats lie on the south eastern side of the islet, where they receive partial shelter from the surrounding rocks. Vast numbers of lobsters are caught and"], [153, "Chap. IV.] PLATEAU DES MINQUIERS. 131 sent to the London market ; also congers and a variety of other fish, all of which find a ready market at Jersey. The Maisons are three remarkable steep rocks with yellowish heads N.W. by W. \u00a3 W. 4\u00a3 miles from Maitresse ile ; they are the highest and most conspicuous rocks at the western side of the high central portion of the reef, although not so high as Maitresse ile, being only 15 feet above high water. Haute Grune, South nearly one mile from the Maisons, rises from the centre of a large mass of rock connected with the Faucheur by a reef, of which many of the highest heads are awash at low water, springs. The Haute Grune never covers, being 5 feet above the highest tides ; it therefore serves as a good mark for other dangers in the neighbourhood. The Grunes de Norman, a reef of which the highest head uncovers 14 feet, lies W. by S. h S. 5 cables from the Haute Grune. The Faucheurs is the name given to a large extent of rocks, of which three heads never cover ; they lie W. \\ N. 3 miles from Maitresse ile, and S.E. by S. 1\u00a3 miles from the Maisons; they are remarkable from their superior size as compared with other rocks in the neighbourhood, and therefore of great service as a mark. The Figuier is a rock always above water N.W. by N. 1\u00a3 miles from Maitresse ile. Red Frouquie is a rock of nearly the same size, height, and character as the Figuier, about midway between it and Maitresse ile. Calfateurs are four small rocks, always uncovered, a cable east ward of Maitresse ile, with which they are connected at low water. Rocher du Sud is a large rock, always uncovered, S. by W. \u00a3 W. 4 cables from Maitresse ile. Grand Vascelin, N.W. by N. 3 miles from Maitresse ile, uncovers 43 feet. This is a large flat rock with two heads always, above water, very conspicuous from its size, and, from its position, a very useful mark. The Petit Vascelin bears N.E. by N. three quarters of a mile from the Grand Vascelin and lies close to the edge of the reef near deep water, but, being 13 feet lower than the Grand Vascelin, it is covered for a considerable period during spring tides. The Pipette Rocks are a considerable group at the north western extreme of the elevated part of the Minquiers reef. The highest point, like the Grand Vascelin, uncovers 43 feet and is there- I 2"], [154, "132 [Chap. IV. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. fore always above water. The outer rock of the group is the Grand Haguet ; it covers at high water and bears N.W. nearly half a mile from the high head of Pipette ; N.W. \u00a3 W. 5 miles from Maitresse ile ; W. \u00a3 N. 2^ miles from the outer part of Petit Vascelin ; and, E. \u00a3 S. %\\ miles from the Grune du Nord-Ouest. St. Peter's spire, Jersey, over the quarry at Le Fret point leads over the rock. The rocks just described are all within the limits of the middle or higher portion of the reef -, westward of this part, the most remark able are Deree Anglaise, Grune du Nord-Ouest, Brisants du Nord- Ouest, Brisants du Sud, and Deree Franchise. Southward, the danger line is marked by the Four, Souarde, and Sauvages ; see caution page 134. Eastward, numerous sunken rocks extend nearly 6 miles from Maitresse ile. Deree Anglaise is a small cluster of rocks, of which the largest and highest dries 27 feet and lies N.W. by W. \u00a3 W. 2 miles from the Maisons, Maitresse ile being on the same line of bearing. There is a 3-fathoms passage between this rock and the Maisons, but it lies very close past Deree, and is only half a mile wide ; a long string of rocks extends from the Maisons westward for \\\\ miles. Grune du Nord-Ouest, on the extreme northern edge of the plateau des Minquiers, bears W. \u00a3 N. 2^ miles from the Grand Haguet, the outer rock of the Pipette group ; and, N.N.W. \\ W. 1^ miles from Deree Anglaise. This rock dries 5 feet at low water ; it is steep-to on its northern and eastern sides but has numerous sunken rocks southward and south-westward of it. Brisants du Nord-Ouest form the north-western extreme of the Minquiers reef and are connected with the Grunes du Nord-Ouest by a rocky sunken ledge. The highest head of the Brisants dries 3 feet only and lies with the Faucheur and Haute Grune in line S.E. \u00a3 E. At an elevation of 30 feet, Maitresse ile may be seen open northward of the Maisons, the apparent breadth of the latter, S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. ; Grune du Nord-Ouest bears E. \\ S. \\\\ miles, the outer parts of the Pipette group and of Petit Vascelin being on the same line of bearing; and, St. Ouen spire, Jersey, on with the white house on the high land of La Moye bears N.N.E. \u00a3 E.

D6r6e Francaise consists of two rocks which uncover 6 feet nearly East and West one third of a mile distant from each other. From the eastern rock, Prince's tower, Jersey, is seen touching the eastern side of Deree Anglaise N.E. ; and, Maitresse ile appears open southward of the Faucheurs E. \u00a3 S. Brisants du Sud are near the south-western edge of the plateau, 1\u00a3 miles south-westward from Deree Francaise ; they consist of a small patch of rocks with from one to 2 fathoms over them. Another small patch of sunken reef lies a quarter of a mile W.N.W. of this, and is the outer danger on this side ; from it, the Minquiers light-ship bears S.W. by S. 1\\ miles. The Pointus rocks form an extensive reef about 2 miles S.W. lj W. from the Faucheurs, of which many rocky heads uncover. They are \\\\ miles in length N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. and about 1\\ cables in width. The Four, the highest head of a small group on the southern edge of the Minquiers, uncovers at half ebb and dries 18 feet at low water ; from it, La Moye white house on with the middle Maison rock bears N. \u00a3 E. easterly ; and, Chausey lighthouse on with the Corbiere rock S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. i The Souarde is a group of low rocks nearly a mile in length with a break in the middle, at the southern edge of the Minquiers ; the highest head, near the eastern end, bears E. by S. \u00a3 S. 2\u00a3 miles from the Four and dries 7 feet at low water ; from it, the Corbiere rock, Chausey, on with La Tour point, bears S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. ; and, the Maisons rocks are a little open westward of the Faucheurs N. by W. \u00a3 W.

Until further examination of this part of the plateau it should be approached only with great caution. The Sauvages are a cluster of dangerous rocks detached from the southern edge of the Minquiers reef, their western end lying 2 miles E.S.E. from the eastern end of the Souarde ; they are three quarters of a mile long E.S.E. and W.S.W. and one quarter of a mile broad, with from 2 to 15 feet water over them. From the 2-feet rock near the middle, Chausey lighthouse is a little open northward of the Corbiere S.E. by E. \\ E. 1\\ miles ; the white house at La Moye, Jersey, is a little open westward of Maitresse ile N. \\ W. westerly ; and, the town of Granville is wholly open southward of Chausey.

From the eastern rock, St. Peter's spire appears open eastward of Bergerie house N. \\ E. A small reef nearly awash at low water, springs, lies E.S.E. nearly three quarters of a mile from the Demies. The best passage into Maitresse ile is between this rock and Grune Gauvin. The Caux des Minquiers extend from Le Rat rock in an easterly direction for 4^ miles, their eastern end, named the East Danger, forming the eastern extreme of the Plateau des Minquiers. The whole of this line is so thickly studded with rocks as to render the navigation amongst them perilous, even for boats, at low water ; but, as none of the rocks dry more than 7 feet, there is never less than 11 feet over them at half tide ; from half flood to half ebb, therefore, it is not at all uncommon for vessels of light draught to sail over them. Turnabout Rock dries 4 feet at low water, and is then the easternmost danger visible. From this rock, Seymour tower appears westward of Mont Orgueil, midway between it and Seymour house, N. \\ E. easterly ; and, the-* Maisons and Figuier rocks in line W. \\ N. northerly ; the reef extends from Turnabout rock eastward as far as. the East Danger.

The south-western extreme may also be cleared by more than 2 miles by bringing the Grand Larron semaphore, St. Malo, on with the eastern end of Cezembre island S. by E. \u00a3 E. easterly. To clear the eastern end, St. Martin's spire and Seymour tower in line N.|W. leads from half to three quarters of a mile eastward of the bell buoy marking the eastern extreme of the reef.

In foggy weather or at night, in rounding the western end of the Minquiers reef from the northward during the flood, a berth of at least 3 or 4 miles should be given it, and should anything less than 16 or 17 fathoms be obtained, haul out to the westward at once. The first part of the flood sets strongly over the reef, and no vessel should risk a near approach to its northern edge until 4 hours flood ; after which, the stream setting along and off the reef is no longer dangerous.

To pass westward of the Ardentes, between them and the Western Ardentes, bring the Enseigne rock beacon turret, Chausey, a little open eastward of the beacon on Grande ile. The Maisons rocks and Maitresse ile in line also lead midway between the Ardentes. The northern and western sides of the Chausey group are steep, and may be safely approached within half a mile. The Corbiere bank however, of ?>\\ fathoms, lies one mile from the western shore, having a 5-fathoms channel inside it. When the Corbiere rock, Chausey, bears South, a vessel is on the line of the Western Ardentes, after passing which she may round the western end of Chausey at about lly miles. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the Minquiers at 6 h. 6 m. ; springs rise 35 feet, neaps 26 feet. At and above half tide there are not less than 11 feet water over any part of the Caux des Minquiers. In moderate weather, light draught vessels may then safely pass over them, provided they do not venture westward of Icho and Prince's towers in line N. i E. easterly. When navigating in the neighbourhood of the plateau des Minquiers, the state of the tide and the effect of the tidal stream on the vessel's course must be most carefully considered and allowed for. THE ARDENTES, 7h miles E.S.E. from Maitresse ile and 3^ miles northward of the Chausey group, consist of two small banks of sand, shells, and stones, each having also a few rocky heads which dry 6 feet at low water ; their western edge bears E.S.E. 7 miles from Maitresse ile. The banks are half a mile apart, in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, and are steep-to all round. The marks for the southernmost rocky head of the western bank are, Granville light house on with the southern side of the Etat or Petite Canue rock S.E. by S., or, Granville church three times 'its own length open southward of the Canue ; and, the high land of La Tour point, Chausey, wholly open eastward of the Enseigne beacon turret S. \\ E.

The Western Ardentes are about three quarters of a mile south-westward of the Ardentes, and the bank is of much the same character as the latter, but no part of it ever uncovers ; it has a general depth of from 15 to 18 feet, except over one rock near its western end on which there are but 5 feet at low water. This spot bears N. \u00a3 W. nearly 3^ miles from the Rondes de l'Ouest, the north western rocks of the Chausey group ; and, from it, Mont St. Michel is in sight eastward of La Tour point S. by E. \u00a3 E. easterly ; the remarkable trees on Mont Huchon are nearly on with Agon church E. \u00a3 N. northerly ; and, Prince's tower appears a little open westward of Grouville mill N. \u00a3 W. Nearly midway between the Ardentes and the plateau des Minquiers is another rocky ledge of 3^ fathoms. Between the Ardentes and the Chausey isles there is a good clear channel with from 7 to 9 fathoms, but great care is required in its navigation, owing to the strength of the tidal streams. Anchorage is good near the middle of the channel ; but, to prevent danger in case of driving during the strength of the stream, care must be taken to anchor clear of the line of tide of any of the dangers. THE CHAUSEY ISLES, lying between the Plateau des Min quiers and Granville, form an extensive group of little islets and rocks 6\u00a3 miles long in an E.S.E. direction from the Rondes de l'Ouest to the Founet, the easternmost rock, about 3 miles wide, and occupying a space of nearly 16 square miles. Grande lie, Chausey, on the southern side of the group, is the principal and largest islet ; from the lighthouse on La Tour point, the south-eastern point of the ile, Grouin point bears S.S.W. 9^ miles ; Granville lighthouse S.E. by E. 8^ miles ; La Roque point, Jersey, N.

It is about a mile long N.N.W. and S.S.E., one third of a mile wide, deeply indented by small bays, of which the projecting points are topped by hills, and near its centre, which is rather high, is some cultivated land.* On the southern part of the islet are the lighthouse, a chapel, and a fort ; in the central part, the ruins of an old fort, a farm-house, several cottages in which about 200 stone-cutters reside, and two or three small blacksmiths' shops ; and, on the eastern summit of Gros- Mont, at the northern end, is a Semaphore. The lighthouse and Semaphore stand high, and are prominent objects from seaward in * See Admiralty plan of Chausey isles, No. 63 ; scale, m == 5 inches."], [161, "Chap, iv.] WESTERN ARDENTES. \u2014 CHAUSEY ISLES. 139 all directions, showing well above all the other islets of the plateau. Grande lie has several granite quarries, of which a large quantity is sent to France. Longue lie, 6 cables eastward of the lighthouse, is very useful as a mark in rounding the south-western part of the group. On ile de la Meule, N.W. H miles from the lighthouse, are the ruins of a convent and a well of good water. The western part of the group contains 15 or 16 islets and numerous rocks. The Chausey group, although dangerous and intricate to navigate, is steep-to on the northern and western sides, but the southern side should be approached with caution especially at low water, when the eastern side is quite inaccessible to vessels of deep draught, on account of the sand-banks which almost close the channel between it and Granville. The anchorage generally resorted to by vessels of war is Port Marie road, off the southern side of Grande lie. There are several harbours among the rocks completely sheltered from all winds, of which Chausey Sound, between Grande lie and the Puceau rock to the eastward, is most used ; it is, however, very narrow, difficult of access, and only frequented by fishermen, stone boats, and other small craft capable of taking the ground. LIGHT. \u2014 A square lighthouse, 56 feet high, stands on the summit of the hill which crowns La Tour point, the south-eastern extreme of Grande lie ; it exhibits -a fixed white light, varied every four minutes by a red flash, which is preceded and followed by a short eclipse ; the eclipses are not total in ordinary weather within a distance of 6 miles. The light is of the third order, 121 feet above high water, and visible in clear weather 16 miles ; the lighthouse on with the Corbiere rock S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. has hitherto been considered to show the precise limits of the south-eastern part of the Minquiers ledge, but this line leads northward of the rock discovered south ward of the Souarde in July 1886. See page 134. The Corbiere is a high and remarkable rock at the south-western edge of the Chausey group N.W. by W. \u00a3 W. 1-^ miles from the lighthouse and about half a mile south-westward of Meule islet.

Bane de la Corbiere, off the western end of the Chausey isles and composed of sand and shells, extendsJL^ miles in a S. by E. and N. by W. direction with an outward curve, and is about 2 cables wide at its broadest part. Its general depths are from 3^ to 4^ fathoms, the shoalest water being near the middle of the bank. From the southern end in 4 fathoms, the Corbiere rock bears E. \\ N. 8 cables ; and, from the shoalest part of 3^ fathoms, the lighthouse is on with the Corbiere S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. Between this bank and the isles, the depths are from 5 to 9 fathoms, the deepest water being near the isles. The Cancalaise is the highest head of a small rocky ridge a quarter of a mile from the southernmost rocks of the Chausey group and in the space between are several rocky patches with from 1 to 7 feet only. The ridge is a cable long East and West, and the highest head, at the eastern end, uncovers 12 feet at the lowest tides, at which time a rock is awash at the western end. The northern end of the eastern ile des Huguenans touching La Tour point E. \u00a3 S., is the mark for the highest head. To clear the Cancalaise when rounding the south-western end of Chausey, keep the Rondes de l'Ouest in sight westward of the Corbiere until the southern house on Longue ile comes well open southward of La Tour point. Basse du Cancalaise, a rocky patch about a cable in diameter, is \\\\ cables E. by S. of the Cancalaise ; the highest head, on its western side, uncovers 6 feet, and another head, on the northern side, uncovers 5 feet. Between the Basse du Cancalaise and the Chausey isles there are rocky heads which uncover from 4 to 8 feet. Basse du Chateau, of which the shoalest spot bears S.W. 4^ cables from Chausey lighthouse, is about \\\\ cables long N. by E. and S. by W. and one cable wide ; it has 14 feet water at its northern end, 20 feet near the middle, and 27 feet at its southern end ; from which, the highest and northernmost head of the Epiettes touching La Tour point bears N.E. northerly. The Huguenan beacon turret on with the highest head of the Pilliers E. \\ N. leads 2 cables southward. Roches de Bratagne, about a cable southward of Bretagne point, form a ridge 1^ cables long N.N.W. and S.S.E. and one cable wide.

The mark for -the southernmost head of 11^ feet is, the beacon on the Epiettes nearly a sail's breadth open southward of La Tour point. The Tour Patches are three small rocky heads about 2 cables southward of La Tour point. The two westernmost patches have only 6 feet water, bear N. by E. \\ E. and S. by W. \\ W. from each other, and are about 50 yards apart. The eastern head has 11 feet water, and bears E. by S. \\ S. half a cable from the south western patch. Basse des Epiettes.\u2014 This small patch, half a cable long N.N.W. and S.S.E., has two small rocky heads with only 3 feet water. The Enseigne beacon turret on with the eastern slope of Grande lie N. \\ W. leads between the Basse des Epiettes and the Tour patches, but directly towards the Tonneau rock, which dries 12 feet about a cable south-eastward of La Tour point. Basse de l'lle Longue is a rocky head with only 3 feet water S. \u00a3 W. nearly 4 cables from Longue ile ; and, S.E. 8 cables from the lighthouse on La Tour point. From it, the Conchee rock touching the southern end of the eastern ile des Huguenans bears East ; and, the northern and southern heads of the Epiettes in line bear N.W. by N. Fis-Cous and Basses du FiS-C0US.\u2014 Midway between Longue ile and the Huguenans are the Fis-Cous and Basses du Fis-Cous, two rocky patches which may be dangerous to a vessel working along the southern side of the Chausey group. The Fis-Cous is about 50 yards in extent, uncovers 9 feet, and is marked by a beacon. It bears S.E. by E. 6^ cables from the southern end of Longue ile ; W. \\ N. 7 cables from the Chapelle rock ; and, S.W. \u00a3 W. 3 cables from the Grand Cheval rock. A small rock. awash at low water, lies a cable eastward of the Fis-Cous. The Basses du Fis-Cous, about a cable in extent, lie one cable westward from the Fis-Cous. One head of this danger is awash at the lowest tides, and others have only from one to 4 feet over them.

On the summit of the largest and most eastern islet, is a stone beacon turret, which, when in line with a similar turret on the Etat rock N. by E. \\ E. easterly, shows the western limit of the fishing grounds. The summit of the largest islet is covered with grass, and sheep from Granville often graze there. The Conchae. \u2014 This rock is half a mile eastward of the iles des Huguenans, on the eastern side of the Conchee passage ; its summit is about 20 feet above the highest tides. The Basse de la Conchee uncovers 7 feet about 3 cables E. \u00a3 S. from the Conchee. Haute Foraine, E. \\ N. a long mile from the Conchee, is the easternmost high rock connected with the Chausey group and is marked by a beacon. Its advanced easterly position renders it very conspicuous, and Granville pilots use it in estimating the height of the tide. It uncovers 28^ feet at the lowest tides, and when it covers there are from 15 to 16 feet water at the entrance cf Granville harbour. A sand-bank of some extent, with 9 feet water, lies 3 cables north-eastward of the Haute Foraine. The Tomin is a small and dangerous rock which uncovers 18 feet a quarter of a mile south-westward of the Haute Foraine and a little northward of the line of the lighthouse on with the northern point of the largest of the Huguenans. The j Pignon, an isolated dangerous rock N.E. \\ N. rather more than half a mile from the summit of the Haute Foraine, uncovers 10 feet at the lowest tides and does not show at ordinary neaps. A floating beacon is moored on this rock. A cable south-eastward of it there is a flat with only 2 feet water. The Founet, the easternmost rock of the Chausey group, uncovers 7 feet ; the marks for it are, the Canue and Etat rocks nearly in line N.W. \\ N. ; Coutances cathedral its own breadth open eastward of Mont Martin mill E.N.E. \u25a0 and, the top of Conchee rock perceptibly open southward of the little hillcock which crowns the southern point of the largest of the Huguenans bearing W. \\ S.

Basse du Founet, an isolated rocky patch with 3| feet only, bears N.N.E. \\ E. 1\u00a3 cables from the Founet ; between it and the Pignon are patches of from 10 to 14 feet. Clearing Marks. \u2014 The summit of the Conchee rock on with the lighthouse on La Tour point W. by N. \\ N., or on with the stone beacon turret on the largest of the Huguenans, leads southward of the Founet, Haute Foraine, and Tomin rocks ; and, the Etat rock twice its apparent breadth open northward of the summit of the Canue leads northward of the Basse du Founet. Even at low water, springs, Chausey pilots take vessels between the Founet and Pignon rocks, but strangers should use this passage only at low water, neaps, or at 2 hours' flood at springs, and then only when the Haute Foraine is uncovered or its beacon plainly visible. The Canue, or Grande Canue rock, never wholly covers ; it lies E. by N. \\ N. northerly 3^ miles from Chausey lighthouse, and its summit is 6 feet above the level of the highest tides. South eastward of the Canue, a reef named the Canuettes, many of whose heads dry from 7 to 21 feet, extends 7 cables in the direction of the Founet. The Etat, or Petite Canue, is aremarkable rock on the northern edge of the Chausey group ; on its summit is a stone beacon turret, similar to that on the largest Huguenan, which bears from it S. by W. \\ W. westerly ; it is painted with black and white horizontal bands. These turrets in line show the western limit of the fishing .grounds, and are also of great use as marks to lead between the Marie ledge and Catheue banks northward of Chausey isles. From the Etat rock, the Dechiree ledge, at the north-western extreme of the Chausey group, bears W. by N. \\ N. 3^ miles. The northern edge of the plateau, which is here steep-to, is indicated by several rocks which seldom or never cover, of which the Selliere, 1^ miles westward of the Etat, is a useful mark ; and, by many more which uncover as the tide falls, of which the principal are, the Petite Entree, which uncovers 36 feet and is marked by a beacon; the Grande Entree, which uncovers 38 feet ; the Pointue, which uncovers 41 feet ; and the Dechiree ledge of which the highest part uncovers 33 feet. L'Enseigne, a small islet about 8 feet above the level of the highest tides, is one mile nearly within the northern edge of the"], [166, "144 [Chap. iv. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. plateau, and 2 miles northward of La Tour point ; it is remarkable from the uniform convexity of its surface, and has a small white stone beacon turret on its summit. Rondes de la Dechirde, a rocky ridge at the north-western side of the Chausey group, is 3 cables long in a N.E and S.W. direc tion ; the northernmost head uncovers 39 feet, and the highest head, near the middle of the ridge, uncovers 45 feet, and therefore only covers at the highest equinoctial spring tides. There are several other low heads on the ridge ; that at its southern extreme, uncovers only 4 feet, with the north-western point of the Pointue rock touching the south-eastern extreme of the Dechiree E. by N. \u00a3 N. ; and, the light house on with the Chapeau rock S.S.E. \\ E. easterly. Basse du Chenal. \u2014 This small rocky patch, between the Rondes de la Dechiree and the Rondes de l'Ouest, is exactly in the fairway of the entrance to the Rondes anchorage, is about three quarters of a cable from the northern extreme of the Rondes de l'Ouest, and has only 5 feet water. The marks for it are, the Pointue rock just open southward of the Dechiree E. by N . \\ N. ; and, the lighthouse a little open south-westward of Gros-Mont semaphore S.E. by S. Rondes de l'Ouest is a rocky ridge, 6 cables long N.N.E. and S.S.W. and 2 cables wide, forming the western extreme of the Chausey group. Several of its heads never cover and serve as good marks for the south-western limits of the group. SOUND de CHAUSEY, so called from the secure anchorage it affords to vessels of light draught, trends N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. along the eastern side of the Grande lie, and occupies a space 6 cables long between La Tour point and Gros-Mont semaphore. At low water, springs, it is surrounded by rocks and banks of sand and mud, which form a natural harbour where vessels capable of taking the ground find capital shelter ; if remaining longer than one tide, or at springs, they should, however, moor head and stern to prevent tailing on the banks. The Sound is sheltered on all sides except from S.S.E. to E.S.E., and strong winds from that quarter throw in a heavy sea at high water. Fresh winds from N.N.E. to N.W. are also much felt, causing a heavy swell throughout the whole extent of the Sound from one hour before until two hours after high water. Although the deepest parts of the Sound do not dry, there remains but little water in them, and the soundings are very irregular. There are, however, two narrow gullies with space for three or four"], [167, "Chap. IV.] CHAUSEY SOUND. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 145 short vessels of from 10 to 11 feet draught to remain afloat. The largest, at the entrance of the Sound, is 325 yards long and from 55 to 65 yards broad, with depths of from 10 to 17 feet, but it is occupied by three mooring buoys for the use of the guard-vessel protecting the fisheries. The second is only 173 yards long, with from 8 to 15 feet, and is a little northward of the former, in front of the farm-house and chapel, and abreast of the Crabiere rock which uncovers 24 feet ; this anchorage also is usually occupied by one of the fishery cruisers secured with a mooring chain on each quarter and each bow. The best place for grounding is on the lowest part of the beach between the Crabiere and Tourette rocks, where the bottom is soft mud, but there are many scattered heads of rock beneath the mud, rendering the surface uneven and liable to damage vessels of any size ; those up to 60 or 65 feet in length may, however, beach here in safety. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Two entrances lead to Chausey Sound, one from the southward between La Tour point and Longue ile, the other from the northward between the Enseigne and Etardiere. The first is the simplest and best ; it is divided into two channels by the Epiettes, and neither are practicable at low wTater. The South Channel, between La Tour point and the Epiettes, is accessible to vessels drawing 10 feet as soon as the Tonneau rock is covered, and there are 12 feet in mid-channel at 2 hours flood. In taking this channel, bring the Enseigne white beacon turret just in sight eastward of the eastern slope of Grande lie N. \u00a3 W., which leads between the Epiettes and La Tour patches. The beacon on the south-western rock of the Epiettes may then be steered for and approached to within half a cable ; then steer north ward in mid-channel parallel with the shore of the isle, and, if intending to run northward of the Crabiere, pass between it and the beacon half a cable eastward of it, giving the Crabiere a berth of at least 30 or 40 yards to clear the tail which runs out from it in that direction. The South-East Channel is eastward of the Basse des Epiettes ; the leading mark is, Gros-Mont semaphore on with the Tourette rock, a short steep point on the beach a cable north-eastward of the farm-house, N.W. \\ W. When passing Longue ile, to clear the ledge off its southern end, open the semaphore a little westward of the Tourette, taking care to bring them quickly on again, after passing it ; A 2771.

GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. the mark then leads directly towards the Crabiere, passing the Loup beacon, which stands at the northern end of the rock, on the port hand, and the Ebauche beacon, on the western part of that ridge, on the starboard hand, and over a bank of mud which dries at low water, springs, northward of the Epiettes, when a vessel may either anchor or proceed as if coming through the South channel. The mud bank referred to completely bars the channel, and can only be crossed by vessels above 10 feet draught after 2^ hours flood. When the highest head of the Loup covers there are 16 feet water on this bank. The North Entrance into Sound de Chausey is northward of the Enseigne, between the rocks extending 2 cables eastward of Pointue rock and the Grande Entree ; this latter is a small group of rocks, of which the highest head uncovers 38 feet, 3j cables eastward of the low rocks extending from the Pointue. The highest head of the Pointue uncovers 41 feet. The inner portion of this channel, southward of the Etardiere, is completely barred at low water by vast sand-banks uncovering generally only a few feet, but between the Sauniere and Vieux they dry as much as 15 feet in places. The greater part of the rocks being marked by beacons, strict atten tion to the following directions render it safe of access between half flood and half ebb to vessels up to 10 feet draught ; no stranger, however, should attempt so intricate and contracted a channel without a pilot. The channel from the entrance continues in a southerly direction between the western edge of a rocky group named the Longues, on the western edge of which is a beacon, and the Basse de l'Etardiere, a flat rock at 2 cables distance which uncovers 8 feet a cable eastward of the Etardiere, to which rock it is joined at low water, springs, by a sand-bank. From thence, the channel takes a W.S.W. direction between the Etardiere rock, which never covers, and the Enseigne ; and then, a southerly direction, leaving on the port hand the low rocks extending from the Petite Enseigne, the Sauniere a small islet 57 feet above the lowest tides, and the Petite Fourche ; and, on the starboard hand, the Massue and a rocky group eastward of the Vieux, and from thence to the Sound. The Massue has a beacon off its north-eastern extreme and a whitewashed rock at its south-eastern ; a rock with a beacon lies off the northern end of the Petite Fourche nearly in the fairway, and a vessel may pass it on either side. In entering by the North channel, the leading mark is, the light-"], [169, "Chap.

In passing the Basse de l'Etardiere, when the two white patches on the Massue and the Chapeau rocks are in line, or when the southern end of Meule islet is just touching the northern end of the Massue S.W. \\ W., run in that direction until the lighthouse is on with the south-western point of Sauniere islet S. by E. E. ; this leads up to the Sauniere ; give it a berth of haif a cable in passing, and also leave the beacon off its southern end close on the port hand, and, after passing it, steer in mid-channel between the beacons marking the rocks on either side of the channel abreast of the Gros-Mont. Enseigne Anchorage is a small space where vessels of 10 feet draught, under the guidance of good pilots, may find shelter from S.W., South, or S.E. winds. With northerly winds, no vessel should anchor there except to await water through the North channel into Chausey Sound, as from its limited extent there is neither room to veer nor drive without tailing on the sand-bank, which, at low water, dries 1^ cables northward of the Enseigne. Run for this anchorage through the North entrance with the same mark as if bound for Chausey Sound until the vessel is well south ward of the Pointue ; then bring the lighthouse on with the south western slope of the Enseigne, and when the southern end of Meule islet touches the northern end of the Massue rock, anchor, and the vessel will be in the best anchorage and deepest water, 22 to 36 feet, sandy bottom, midway between the Basse de l'Etardiere and the Longues. Great care must be taken to estimate the height of the tide between half ebb and half flood, as the soundings, when south ward of the Pointue rocks, vary from 7 feet only to 22 feet at low water, and also to avoid a small rock with only 4 feet, nearly in the fairway of the entrance. PORT MARIE is the little bay between La Tour and Bretagne points, in front of which, 2 cables off-shore, is a small space capable of affording shelter from winds between N.W. and N.E. to two or three vessels of 10 feet draught, ANCHORAGES. \u2014 The inner anchorage off Port Marie, between the Bretagne rocks and Tour patches, is not more than 3 cables in extent.

From the South-east, the westernmost point of Grand lie, forming port Homard, touching Bretagne point N.N.W. \\ W., leads outside the Tour patches and north-eastward of the Chateau patch and Bretagne rocks ; when the northernmost head of the Epiettes is shut in with La Tour point, anchor. Port Marie Outer Road is a good anchorage for large vessels of war, and is, in fact, the principal roadstead of Granville, the greater part of the shipping bound for that port remaining here until the water on the banks is sufficiently high to proceed. The best position for a vessel of deep draught in this road is, with the lighthouse bearing N. by W. | W. distant from half a mile to a mile, in from 7 to 11 fathoms. When at anchor, Coutances cathedral should be open northward of the largest of the lies des Huguenans E. by N. \u00a3 N., and the Enseigne white beacon turret should be open eastward of La Tour point. Here she will be sheltered from the wind, if northward of N.W. by N. Should it be inclined to draw more westerly, with an appearance of bad weather, the first oppor tunity should be taken to weigh and get to windward with the ebb, or to run for shelter either to Cancale road, see page 124, or to the eastward or northwrard of the Chausey group, according to the direction of the wind. Conchee Anchorage. \u2014 With the wind from N.W. by W. to N.N.E. the Conchee anchorage in 4i or 5 fathoms is to be preferred ; the marks for it are, the old castle in ruins on Grande lie on with the Huguenans beacon turret W. by N. \\ N., and the Selliere and Culas siere rocks in line N.W. by N. The Etat Anchorage.\u2014 With the wind southward of West, the anchorage under the Etat rock should be resorted to. Anchor in from 5 to 7 fathoms, half or three quarters of a mile from the rocks, with Chausey lighthouse on with the Canue, or on with the Etat beacon turret, according to the direction of the wind. Indeed, all the northern shore of the Chausey group affords shelter against southerly or south-westerly winds, and, being bold, may be approached without fear."], [171, "Chap, iv.] CHAUSEY ISLES. \u2014 ANCHORAGES. 149 Rondes de l'Ouest Anchorage, on the western side of the Chausey group under the Rondes de l'Ouest ridge, is the only shelter the group affords to large vessels during easterly winds. It can be reached at any time of tide either from Port Marie road or from the Conchee or Etat anchorages. When proceeding towards it from Port Marie road, keep Huguenans beacon turret on with the highest rock of the Piliers E. \u00a3 N. northerly, to pass southward of the Chateau patch ; and, when Gros-Mont semaphore bears N.E. \\ N. haul gradually in, but not farther than to have the middle of Longue lie on with La Tour point, East, to avoid the Cancalaise. When the Ronde de l'Ouest, a large and remarkable round rock, is in sight westward of the Corbiere N. by W., haul in to within a quarter of a mile of the rocks, passing between Corbiere bank and the Chausey group, and anchor in from 7 to 9 fathoms, sandy bottom, half a mile westward of the Rondes de l'Ouest and the same distance north-eastward of the Corbiere bank, with the lighthouse midway between Gros-Mont and the western extreme of Grand lie, or touching the southern end of Meule islet, S.E. E. ; and, the Etat beacon turret about midway between the Enseigne beacon turret and the Grande Entree rock E. \\ S. Anchorage between the Rondes de L'Ouest and the Dechiree. \u2014 This anchorage is similar to that of the Enseigne, and affords partial shelter with the wind from South round by East to N.E. It is about 3 cables long and 2 cables wide, and has from 3^ to 65 fathoms, sandy bottom. The entrance is 1\\ cables wide E.N.E. and W.S.W. between the Basse du Chenal, a small rock with only 5 feet at the lowest tides, and a rock forming the south-western extreme of the Rondes de la Dechiree, which uncovers 4 feet. The leading mark in, is, the lighthouse on with Gros-Mont semaphore S.S.E. \u00a3 E. easterly, and when the Pointue rock appears midway between the Dechiree and Grande Entree rocks the vessel is in the middle of the anchorage. There is another anchorage called the Dechiree, eastward of that just described ; it is entirely surrounded by high rocks, which do not cover until the last quarter flood, forming between half ebb and half flood a natural harbour accessible at all tides, but no vessel should use it in changeable, boisterous weather, or without a good local pilot ; it is not more than 5 cables long and 2^ cables wide, the broadest part being between the Dechiree and a rock to the southward which uncovers 24 feet. To enter this anchorage, proceed as before with the lighthouse on"], [172, "[Chap. IV. 150 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. with the semaphore S.S.E. \u00a3 E. ; and, when the Pointue is half its apparent breadth open southward of the Dechiree E. by N. \\ N. the vessel is southward of the Rondes de la Dechiree and should haul to the eastward, taking care to avoid two rocky patches awash at low water, springs, on the southern side of the anchorage. When the lighthouse is on with Massue rock S.S.E., anchor in from 4 to 5 J fathoms water, with rather coarse ground. With the aid of a good pilot, the Enseigne anchorage and the northern channel into Chausey Sound are often entered by this route within 2 hours before or after high water. Beauchamp Anchorage is a quarter of a mile north-westward of the Huguenans, and, with a good pilot, in case of need might afford shelter, at springs, to one or two vessels of deep draught. It consists of a kind of basin or deep about 4 cables long N.N.E. and S.S.W. and 1^ cables wide ; it has from 5 to 6 fathoms at low water, springs, with excellent holding ground, between the lines of the lighthouse on with the southern extreme of the Ango rock, and of Gros-Mont semaphore on with the northern hillock of Grande Ancre or Saddle island. It is sheltered at low water, springs, by the rocks and surrounding sand and mud-banks, it is also tolerably well protected throughout the tide at neaps, but at high water, springs, fresh winds from N.W. to N.E. cause a heavy tumbling sea, which, however, soon subsides as the tide falls. Vessels usually moor N.N.E. and S.S.W., but, if intending to remain, they should be secured with anchors on each bow and quarter. Two sets of moorings with mooring buoys for the use of the small French steam-vessels employed in protecting the oyster fishery occupy the central part of the anchorage. Southern Entrances. \u2014 A vessel of considerable draught with a fair wind and an experienced pilot, may enter the Beauchamp anchorage from the southward at all times by passing betw*een the Grand Piliers and Tournioure rocks ; the latter has on it a beacon, which, however, is sometimes washed away and should not be depended on ; or, between the Tournioure and Chapelle rocks ; but these narrow passages cannot be used at all times without steam or a sufficiently commanding breeze to stem the tidal streams. The leading mark to pass between the Tournioure and Piliers is, the summit of Roche Noire on with the Culassiere rock N.N.E. Great care is required in passing the Tournioure at half flood, the stream immediately outside it setting strongly to the eastward,"], [173, "Chap. IV.] CHAUSEY ISLES.\u2014 ANCHORAGES.\u2014 CHANNELS. 151 whilst between it and the Piliers it takes the direction of the channel. Having passed the Tournioure beacon, steer north-eastward towards the Petit Huguenan to get into the fairway, and then more northerly to pass midway between that islet and Roche Noire, after which the summit of the rock Caniard du Sud open westward of the Culassiere N. by E. E. leads to the anchorage. The entrance eastward of the Tournioure is the deepest but is Only 50 or 60 yards wide between the Tournioure and Chapelle rocks and should never be attempted during the strength of the tide ; the best time is within an hour of high water, and the nearer high water the better. A vessel having passed midway between the Tournioure and Chapelle rocks and also between Roche Noire and Petit Huguenan may proceed to Beauchamp anchorage as before directed. Passe de la Conchae, with a sufficient rise of tide, is the safest entrance to Beauchamp anchorage from the south ward for vessels of light draught ; it lies between the iles des Huguenans and Conchee rocks, and from thence north-westward between two mud-banks, which dry from 3 to 7 feet. The entrance is between the Gaillard d'Avant rock which uncovers 29 feet and has just northward of it the Artimon rock which uncovers 19 feet, and some small heads close south-westward of the Conchee which uncover from 9 to 17 feet. The leading mark is, the Selliere and Petite Mauvaise rocks in line N.N.W. until the lighthouse comes on with the middle of the Ango rock ; then haul to the westward for the anchorage and cross the mud-bank extending northward from the Huguenans. When the small heads close south-westward of the Conchee are covered and the Artimon rock is awash, there are not less than 13 feet on any part of the mud-bank which must be crossed in running for the anchorage. Passe Orientale de l'Etat.\u2014 The Beauchamp anchorage may also be reached from the north-eastward through this passage, which is a clear space through the rocks in the north-eastern part of the Chausey group ; the tide, however, must be sufficiently high for a vessel to cross the sand-bank, which extends over the greater part of the passage and dries from 2 to 5 feet above the level of the lowest tides. The entrance to this passage, 1| cables wide, is between the Pouillou rock which uncovers 32 feet, and some small rocky heads connected with the Petit Etat which uncover from 5 to 10 feet."], [174, "152 [Chap. IV. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. From thence the passage is bounded on the western side by the Caniard du Sud which uncovers 38 feet, and by the Mauvaise which is always above water ; and, on the eastern side, by the Plate du Hibou, a small rocky group of which the highest head uncovers 26^ feet, and by the Culassiere rock which is never covered. The leading mark is, Petite Ancre islet on with the Mauvaise S.W. \u00a3 W. until within about 1^ cables of the latter, then steer southward to pass between it and the Culassiere, and from thence to the anchorage. There are several other entrances to the Beauchamp anchorage on the northern and western sides of the group, of which two admit vessels up to 10 feet draught at low water, but all are so intricate as to be of use only to fishermen and coasters thoroughly acquainted with the localities. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the Chausey group, at 6 h. 9 m. ; equinoctial springs rise 46 feet, ordinary springs 35 feet, and neaps 26 feet ; neap range 17 feet. The stream turns at the eastern end of the group, between Founet and Pignon rocks, from 25 to 30 minutes earlier than in the middle of the passage between the Founet and the Roc de Granville ; that is to say, the flood begins to be felt about 4^ hours before the time of high water at Granville, and the ebb one hour after. Admiralty Bank. \u2014 This narrow ridge of sand lying between the Chausey isles and the mainland is not more than 2 cables wide, and extends 1^ miles N.E. by N. and S.W. by S. with only 7 feet water on the shoalest part close to its northern end ; from it, Granville lighthouse bears S.S.E. 4^ miles ; Coutances cathedral midway between the church and mill of Mont Martin N.E. by E. h E. ; the Conchee rock on with the easternmost of the ile des Huguenans W. \\ N. ; and, the Etat beacon turret just northward of the Canue rock N.W. Coutances cathedral on with Mont Martin church N.E. by E. \\ E. leads eastward of this bank ; the Etat twice its own breadth open northward of the Canue N.W. \\ W., or Mont St. Michel twice its own breadth open westward of Champeaux point S. \\ E. leads north eastward. DANGERS off GRANVILLE\u2014 The navigation between Granville and the Chausey isles at low water, springs, is rendered both difficult and dangerous for vessels drawing more than 7 or 8 feet by the numerous banks and knolls of sand, which form a"], [175, "Chap. IV.] 153 DANGERS OFF GRANVILLE. bar having only from 14 to 17 feet water on the deepest parts, and with several patches of from 2 to 6 feet ; small coasters, however, by following the directions given for this passage, may pass between these banks and the Admiralty bank in not less than 10 feet at low water. Tombelaine bank.\u2014 The flats extending from 1\u00a3 miles W. by N. of pointe du Roc to Champeaux point, on which there are from one to 6 feet water, extend 3^ miles from the shore westward of St. Pair ; they then gradually narrow until nearly abreast of Champeaux point, where the bank again projects seaward in a long narrow spit having 9 feet at its outer end, which bears N.W. 4\u00a3 miles from Champeaux point. The highest of these flats are, the Tombe laine bank, awash at low water, springs, and another little ridge of sand which uncovers one foot. The northern part of this latter lies S.W. about 2^ miles, and the highest part of the Tombelaine S.W. \u00a3 W. 1\u00a3 miles from Granville pier-head light. Basse Dorriere is a small isolated rock, rising from a sandy bottom, with only 4 feet water ; it is a cable N.N.E. from the northern end of the Tombelaine bank, with Granville lighthouse bearing E.N.E. northerly one mile ; and, the pier-head light E. N. 1-ro miles. The Haguet bank is composed of a number of shoal heads with from 2 to 6 feet on them and from 9 to 15 feet between. It extends 2\u00a3 miles in a N. by W. and S. by E. direction, and the northern head with 6 feet bears N.W. N. 3\u00a3 miles from Granville lighthouse. Between this head and the southern end of the Admiralty bank there is a passage about a quarter of a mile wide with 11 feet water. Chausey lighthouse touching Chapelle rock W. by N. h N. is the leading mark through. The southern end is nearly joined to the Tombelaine bank by a narrow ridge of sand which almost dries at low water, springs, thus forming at that time the shallow bar between Granville and the Chausey isles before mentioned. Bane de Rondehaie, a small patch of sand, gravel, and rock, with 10 feet water, bears W. by S. S. 4^ miles from Granville lighthouse. The spire of Granville church open northward of the lighthouse leads nearly a mile northward of the bank ; the Culassiere rock, Chausey, on with the Huguenans beacon turret N. \\ E. leads west ward ; and, Culassiere rock midway between the Huguenans and the Conchee N. \\ W. westerly leads eastward."], [176, "154 [Chap. IV. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. There is a small knoll with 23 feet water N.N.W. about 3 cables from the Rondehaie. The Videcoq, a small rock which uncovers 2^ feet, has from 18 to 20 feet, sandy bottom, on all sides. It is westward of the Haguet bank, with Granville lighthouse bearing E. by S. southerly 3\u00a3 miles ; Chausey lighthouse N.W. N. 5^- miles ; Granville church is on with the second southernmost chimney of the south-western barrack ; and, the Culassiere rock is nearly on with the Conchee N. by W. \\ W. westerly. Granville church on with the northernmost chimney of the south western barrack leads half a mile northward of the Videcoq rock ; the same church on with the southern chimney leads a quarter of a mile southward ; the Mauvaise rock on with the Conchee leads half a mile eastward ; and, the Mauvaise on with the Huguenans leads westward. Buoy. \u2014 The Videcoq is marked on its eastern side by a bell buoy painted with red and black bands. A small sand-bank about 8 cables long N.W. and S.E. and a quarter of a mile wide, with only 6 feet water, lies half a mile northward of the Videcoq. The Mauvaise rock midway between the Huguenans and Conchee N. by W. \u00a3 W., leads westward of it ; and, the three mills of Breville a little open northward of the foot of Menars point leads northward. Basse Parisienne is a small rocky ridge, steep-to, with 13 feet water over it and 6 or 7 fathoms on all sides ; from it, Granville light house bears E. \\ N. 5h miles ; Chausey lighthouse N. by W. \\ W. 5 \\ miles ; and, Pierre de Herpin lighthouse S.W. \u00a3 W. nearly 5 miles. The marks for it are, Haut-Bout mill, on the highland of Grouin point, well open westward of the Herpin rock S.W. \u00a3 W. westerly ; and, Granville lighthouse between the steeple of Granville church and the barracks E. \\ N. These barracks are high, and, standing on the top of the precipice of Roc de Granville north-westward of the steeple, are very conspicuous. The Petits Banes are six or seven small sandy ridges, with from 6 to 9 fathoms on them, S.S.W. 3i miles from Chausey light house ; they occupy a space \\\\ miles long N.W. and S.E. and half a mile wide. They are not dangerous, but when it blows hard they should be avoided by small vessels as they cause a heavy sea."], [177, "Chap. IV.] GRANVILLE AND OFF-LYING SHOALS. 155 GRANVILLE. \u2014 The port of Granville is between pointe du Roc and Gautier point, which latter bears S.E. by E. | E. 9 cables from the south-western extreme of Roc point. Gautier point is high, and on its summit is a fort which commands the entrance to Granville harbour. The town of Granville is built in the form of an amphitheatre at the foot of the eastern part of the high, narrow, steep peninsula of Le Roc, which is nearly a mile long W. \\ S. and E. \\ N., 300 yards wide, and united with the mainland by a narrow isthmus half a mile northward of Gautier point. The upper town is sur rounded by walls and occupies the eastern part of the peninsula ; the lower town stands on the isthmus at the entrance of a narrow valley enclosed between high hills, and watered by the little river Bosc which separates the suburbs from the lower town, its waters when swollen by rains running over the sands westward. The outer harbour is on the western side of the lower town at the foot of Le Roc, which, with the adjacent land, shelters it from winds from N.W. round by North and East to S.S.E., and the pier protects it from the heavy sea caused by south-westerly winds, but it is open from South to S.S.E. The water is smooth in the harbour when it blows hard from North to N.W., but vessels should then be well moored to resist the violent squalls which rush down from Le Roc. The pier is built on the rocks which uncover at the foot of the south western part of Le Roc. It begins at 65 yards westward of the last houses in the lower town, and from thence extends in a southerly direction about 390 yards ; it then turns eastward for about 210 yards, and is terminated by a broad pier-head. The eastern pier approaches the western pier from the north-eastward, leaving a passage about 142 yards wide between the pier-heads. A wet dock or basin, some times called the inner harbour, has its entrance from the eastern side of the harbour by means of a lock 246 feet in length and 54 feet wide, its outer sill is 8\u00a3 feet, and its inner sill 13| feet above the level of low water, springs, which latter is also the level of the bottom of the basin. Another small basin lies on the eastern side of the main basin and communicates with it by means of an opening, without gates, 39 feet wide ; vessels of 10 feet draught are neaped in this inner basin during the lowrest tides. The outer harbour dries at low water, but is accessible both at springs and neaps to vessels of considerable draught. The inner harbour or basin can only be entered from one to \\\\ hours before or after high water, according to the height of the tide. The outer harbour can be entered at ordinary neaps from 1^ hours before to 1^ hours after high water ; the bottom is mud, the berths, except by"], [178, "[Chap. IV. 156 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. the eastern jetties, are good, and a sharp vessel will ground upright and lie in safety. There is a gridiron in the north-western part of the outer harbour. Granville is in direct railway communication with Paris, the distance occupying about 8 hours ; the steamers of the London and South-Western Railway Company also ply regularly between it and Jersey, thus connecting it with England. It has a considerable trade, but one of its principal industries, the oyster fishery, has entirely failed of late years. The rocky bed forming the base of the western part of Le Roc uncovers 3| cables in a southerly direction from pointe du Roc, and 2 cables North and N.W. from the north-western part of the peninsula, which latter part is marked by a beacon surmounted by a globe, the upper part of the beacon white, the lower part black. The Loup rock, the nearest danger to the harbour, is marked by a beacon turret painted with red and white bands ; it lies S.by W. \u00a3 W. 2\u00a3 cables from the extreme of the western pier, and uncovers 21 feet ; it forms a natural breakwater during south-westerly gales. The pier head lighthouse on with the gap which separates Le Roc from the hills north-eastward of it, leads a cable westward of the Loup ; and, the same lighthouse on with Granville church steeple leads half a cable eastward. The rock covers at half flood, at which time there are 10 feet between the pier-heads, 6 feet within them, and 16j feet over the Tombelaine bank. LIGHTS. \u2014 Granville lighthouse, a circular tower 43 feet high, stands on pointe du Roc or cape Lihou, and exhibits, at 154 feet above high water, a fixed white light of the third order, visible in clear weather 15 miles. From it, Chausey lighthouse bears N.W. by W. 8^ miles ; Pierre de Herpin light W. by S. \u00a3 S. 10 miles ; and, Senequet rock light N. by E. 15f miles. A fixed red light, dioptric and of the fifth order, is shown from a lighthouse on the western pier-head, on the western side of the entrance to the harbour. It is 40 feet above high water and visible 5 miles. A. fixed green light, visible 2 miles, is shown from a lamp-post on the eastern pier-head. Semaphore \u2014 There is a semaphore station close to the light house on pointe du Roc. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Granville at 6 h. 13 m. Ordinary springs rise 37 feet ; neaps 27\u00a3 feet ; neaps range 11\\ feet. Equinoctial springs rise 7 feet higher than ordinary springs."], [179, "Chap, iv.] 157 GRANVILLE.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. Pilots. \u2014 Granville pilots cruise in the vicinity of the iles Chausey in decked two-masted boats. Vessels approaching Granville from the westward, however, during strong westerly winds, do well to haul up under the lee of Grouin point to secure a pilot, as at such times boats may not be able to keep the sea off Granville. Pilots take charge of vessels leaving Granville as far westward as cape Frehel, or as far northward in the Cotentin channel as the Banes Feles. A Life-Boat is stationed at Granville. DIRECTIONS.*\u2014 Entering Granville.\u2014 Bring the pier-head lighthouse open of the fall of the land under the eastern end of Garrison bluff, to pass between the tail of the Loup and the rocks on which the pier is built ; or, if wishing to pass eastward of the Loup rock, open Granville church its own breadth eastward of the light house. Give the pier-head, when rounding it, a berth of a ship's length only, shoot as far to the westward as possible when within it, and drop the anchor when convenient, A vessel drawing 10 feet must not attempt to round the pier-head until 4 hours flood, especially if there be any sea. All possible sail should be carried when entering the harbour, and, in the event of a sudden shift of wind, a vessel should be prepared either to anchor or to run out a hawser to the warping buoy between the Loup rock and the plateau Jean-la-Blanche. When it blows hard between N.W. and S.W., the great inequalities of the rocky ridge extending southward from Granville lighthouse occasion a heavy sea outside the mouth of the harbour, and the outer part of this ridge, which uncovers 9 feet at the lowest tides, is then very dangerous ; there is also a heavy breaking sea in the passage between the pier and the Loup with strong winds betw*een N.W. and West. This dangerous part is avoided by keeping St. Nicholas church steeple on with the southern slope of Gautier point. Should the wind be light, endeavour to maintain a position off the harbour, so as to be carried towards the entrance from 1\\ hours before to half an hour after high water, while the stream is running East and E.N.E. *, but do not attempt to enter before high water, or the vessel may be carried westward of the pier, and even on pointe du Roc, by the eddy on the flood, which leaves the harbour after traversing the quays from East to West, and runs along the shore * Directions for navigating the Contentin passage between cape de la Hague and Granville will be found at pages 186-192."], [180, "[Chap. IV. 158 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. towards pointe du Roc. The strength of this eddy is from one to 1^ knots at springs, it runs from half flood to high water, and it is in order to stem it that plenty of sail should be carried when entering the harbour. When arriving off the harbour before there is sufficient water to enter ; if the wind is strong enough to stem the tide, keep southward of the line of St. Nicholas church steeple on with the southern slope of Gautier point. With the wind from N.E. round by North to W.N.W. keep northward of this line and make short tacks southward of the Chausey islets, between Chausey lighthouse and the Conchee ; and, with the wind from W.N.W. round by West to South, short boards should be made between Grouin point and the Parisiennne ridge, not standing southward of an imaginary line drawn from Pierre de Herpin lighthouse to Champeaux point. As soon as there is water sufficient to enter the harbour, steer for it, keeping the pier head lighthouse on with the gap which separates Le Roc peninsula from the hills north-eastward of the town ; this leads a cable westward of the Loup and to the entrance of the harbour. In working towards the harbour from the S.W., make a long board to the northward of the line of St. Nicholas church steeple on with the southern slope of Gautier point, but avoid being carried too far northward by the flood stream. The last board should be made south-eastward of the Loup, taking care to avoid the Norocher, a ridge of rocks of which parts uncover from 10 to 12 feet. From thence, stand for the harbour eastward of the Loup, on which side that rock may be approached to within half a cable without danger. Should the Loup beacon turret be washed away, Granville church steeple on with the pier-head lighthouse leads clear to the eastward. At low water, neaps, small coasters arriving off the harbour with the wind off-shore may anchor to await tide between the Loup rock and Tombelaine bank, where they will then find 10 or 12 feet water over a bottom of sand and broken shells ; at low water, springs, there are only 2 or 3 feet water here. There are also a few rocks in the eastern part of the anchorage, but with Mont St. Michel open of Champeux point, a vessel is 2 cables westward of them. Leaving Granville, a sailing vessel of deep draught should wait for a leading wind, and, if bound westward, advantage should be taken of off-shore winds, particularly those between East and South. If the wind is between E.S.E. and S.S.E. and strong enough to stem the tide, leave as soon as the vessel floats and steer to pass 2 or 3 miles northward of Cezembre island and.of cape Frehel."], [181, "Chap. IV.] GRANVILLE, DIRECTIONS. \u2014 THE COAST. 159 If between South and W.S.W., haul out to the warping buoys as soon as she is afloat and make sail from the outermost buoy. Short boards must be made as far as Thar point, 2\\ miles southward of the harbour, and from thence they may be lengthened, coasting at a safe distance from the in-shore dangers as far as cape Frehel, to avoid being carried by the tides towards the Minquiers and. other off-lying dangers. In fine weather, the Minquiers light-vessel, together with the lights of Chausey, Granville, Pierre de Herpin, St. Malo, and cape Frehel, render this navigation as easy by night as by day. THE COAST. \u2014 From pointe du Roc, Granville, cape de Carteret, which is the western extreme of the first high land on the coast northward of Granville, bears N. \u00a3 E. easterly 33 miles, the whole of the coast line between the two points being low and receding slightly eastward. Six small harbours, capable of affording shelter to coasters of 40 or 50 tons, are within this space : viz., Regneville, Geffosse, St. Germain-sur-Ay, Surville, Port Bail, and Havre de Carteret, just eastward of the cape of that name. For the first 16 miles northward of Granville, the sandy beach bordering the coast dries in places at low water as much as 2^ miles from the shore ; northward of Geffosse it uncovers on an average about one mile, and, throughout the whole extent of this tidal seaboard, numerous reefs of rocks are scattered in all directions, rendering the approach to it exceedingly dangerous. The off-lying reefs and shoals between the coast and the Channel islands are also very numerous, causing the navigation between Granville and Cape de la Hague by this route, known as the Cotentin channel, to be both intricate and dangerous, the latter especially if surprised by foggy weather, though it is well lighted and buoyed. Coutances cathedral, about 6 miles inland and 14 miles N.E. from pointe du Roc, is lofty and a useful land-mark ,* it may be known by its two spires or turrets, which occasionally appear like the Reculvers in Kent. The church steeple of Agon, one mile inland, is a large square tower covered with tiles, and the little church steeple of Pirou 8 miles farther northward very much resembles it, From Coutances towards Granville, the interior of the country presents a moderates high but regular outline which terminates at Champeaux point, the bluff and nearly perpendicular headland 5\u00a3 miles southward of Granville. From Coutances northward, the character of the country alters, the interior being lofty though somewhat irregular, and between St. Germain and Barneville, 2 miles eastward of cape de Carteret, the inequalities become very marked and conspicuous."], [182, "160 [Chap. IV. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. The entrance to Regneville is 10 miles N.N.E. \\ E. from Granville lighthouse. The coast between it and St. Germain trends N. by E. for 13 miles, and the shore is low, sandy, and bordered with downs. Among the most remarkable objects is Mont Huchon, about 2 miles northward of Coutances cathedral and 6 miles inland eastward of the entrance to Regneville harbour, and of the western part of the line of hills immediately northward of the harbour, on which stand the village and church of Agon. This part of the hills ends abruptly with steep slopes towards the sea, and, when seen from the north westward at a distance, presents the appearance of a high cape facing westward. The most conspicuous objects on the land between St. Germain and cape de Carteret are, Monts Gardon and Doville, and the hills of Benneville ; on the first stands the village of Mont Gardon and two mills, 3Jr miles from the sea, and 3 miles north-eastward from the town of St. Germain ; Mont Doville, 2\\ miles northward of Mont Gardon and 6^ miles eastward of the entrance to Port Bail, has a windmill on its summit ; and, Benneville hills rise E.N.E. 4 miles from Port Bail and have three windmills on them. CATHEUE BANKS, including Catheue reef and Shamrock knoll, extend North and South 6 miles and lie nearly parallel with the line of coast ; they are chiefly composed of sand. Two patches near their middle dry at very lowT springs, at which time there are 6 feet at their southern end and 2 fathoms at their northern end. These banks are almost connected with the shore on their eastern side and, southward, with the shoal extending from pointe du Roc, from which point, their northern extreme is distant 11 miles ; they are only separated from the Ronquet reef off Regneville by a bed of sand which has from 2 to 12 feet over it at low water, at which time there is no navigable passage between the banks and the shore. The Catheue reef is a dangerous ledge about a mile long in a W.S.W. and E.N.E. direction and a quarter of a mile broad, lying between the northern end of the Catheue banks proper and the Shamrock knoll. It has several rocky heads, of which two uncover at the lowest springs, when the rest have from 3 to 6 feet over them. The highest head uncovers 24 feet near the middle of the reef W.S.W. 2\u00a3 miles from the westernmost head of the Ronquet reef; N. \\ W. Sh miles from Granville lighthouse ; and, N.E. by E. \u00a3 E. 7\u00a3 miles from Chausey lighthouse.

Buoy. \u2014 A red bell buoy is moored half a cable south-eastward of the shoalest part of the Catheue reef. Champeaux point just open of pointe du Roc, South, leads eastward of Catheue banks and reef; and, Agon church steeple on with the southern slope of Mont Huchon, East, leads a safe distance northward of that reef and of the Shamrock knoll. Shamrock Knoll is a sandy ridge at the northern end of the Catheue Banks, one mile long N. by E. and S. by W. and 2 cables wide, with 3 feet on the shoalest part at its southern end, and 2 fathoms at its northern end. The southern end is only about 7 cables north-westward of Catheue reef, and between them is a patch of 6 feet. More than half a mile northward of the knoll are several patches of 2 fathoms. Roches d'Agon are a small group 3\u00a3 miles from the shore, half way between it and the northern extreme of the Shamrock knoll, and 1^ miles north-westward from the Ronquet beacon turret, with from 8 to 10 feet water close to them. They form, in conjunc tion with a bed of rocks on the beach, a continuous ridge extending westward from the direction of Agon steeple, and parallel with the Ronquet and Moulieres d'Agon rocks. The highest head of the Agon rocks uncovers 8 feet ; W.S.W. 4^ cables from it, another head uncovers 6 feet ; and, at a quarter of a mile westward of the latter, another uncovers 2 feet ; this head lies N.W. \\ W.

The latter mark also shows the direction of the western point of the group, which is three quarters of a mile westward of the Ronquet, and is terminated by a rock uncovering 5 feet. Until the establishment of the beacon turret on the Ronquet rock, the whole of this group was very dangerous when covered, as no marks can be given to indicate the position of its western edge which is 3 miles off-shore and bears S.E. \\ E. 6 miles from the Marie ledge ; and, E.N.E. %\\ miles from the highest head of the Catheue reef. Champeaux point just open westward of pointe du Roc leads well westward of it. r r REGNEVILLE is at the mouth of the little river Sienne, into which the river Soulles flows 4 miles in the interior ; the harbour is so choked with sand as to admit coasters only of about 8 or 9 feet draught at high water, springs. The bottom of the harbour, being chiefly sand and shells, is bad holding ground ; the anchors should therefore be buried to avoid driving with strong winds between W N.W. and S.W., to which the entrance is exposed. The entrance is between the Bee d'Agon, or Agon point, and the point on which the guard-house stands, which, on with Mont Martin windmill, is the mark for the south-western extreme of the Ronquet group ; several sand-banks lie in the fairway, and the action of the tides causes Agon point to grow constantly southward, the lighthouse originally built near the extreme being now more than 3 cables from it. Two channels lead to the entrance ; the deepest borders the southern side of the Ronquet group and the Moulieres d'Agon ; the leading mark for it is, the fort 3 cables north-westward of the extreme of Agon point seen between the steeples of Coutances and Grimouville E. \u00a3N. The other channel, named the Coliere, is not quite so deep but has the advantage of leading directly into the harbour and avoiding the turn south-eastward in rounding Agon point, The Caillou rock, which uncovers 17 feet, lies on the eastern side of this channel ; the leading mark is, Grimouville church steeple a little open eastward of"], [185, "Chap, iv.] REGNEVILLE. \u2014 NATTES ROCKS. 163 the Custom-house, the last large house on the shore at the northern part of Regneville village, N.E. by E. \\ E.

The Nattes rocks are a small rocky group about 2 cables long N.W. and S.E. at the south-western extreme of the ridge extending from the Senequet, and N. -J- E. easterly 3 miles from the western edge of the Roches d'Agon ; they are the most western in-shore rocks which uncover between the harbours of Regneville and St. Germain. They lie W.

Champeaux point just showing westward of Pointe du Roc, or Pirou steeple well open westward of Senequet lighthouse, leads outside the Nattes. Their western extreme, in 6 feet, bears N.

Several small ridges of rock uncover from 3 to 5 feet at low water, springs, and form a chain a mile in length which extends from the Nattes north-eastward and joins the outer sunken rocks of the Senequet ridge. A heavy sea runs on all these rocks when it blows hard from the westward. Buoys.\u2014 A red bell buoy, with staff and reflector, is moored in 6 feet water off the western side of the Nattes rocks.

THE SENEQUET ROCK.\u2014 This rock, on which stands a light- house, almost forms a connecting link with the line of dangers extend ing from La Roque point, Jersey. It is 2 miles from the shore, 2^ miles N.W. from the entrance to Blainville, and uncovers 27^ feet. It is the highest head of the rocky ridge which extends eastward from it to the shore, south-eastward to the Klebet rocks, south-westward as far as the Nattes rocks, and north-westward 8 cables. This outer part is very dangerous, as it greatly contracts the passage between the Senequet rock and the B\u0153uf. The outer most head is awash at the lowest tides, with Senequet lighthouse just open southward of Blainville church steeple S.E. The space for more than 2 miles between this head and the Nattes is equally dangerous, being one continued chain of rocks, of which the highest uncover from 6 to 8 feet ; when it blows hard from any direction between North and South round by West, there is a heavy sea on them. Mont Gardon church steeple between the summit of Mont Doville and St. Germain church steeple leads a safe distance outside both the Nattes and the outer rocks of the Senequet. LIGHT. \u2014 The Senequet rock lighthouse is a circular tower 75 feet high, from which, at 56 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed red light, visible in clear weather 12 miles.

CHAUSSEE-des-B\u0152UFS are ledges of dangerous rocks 2\\ miles long, East and West, and one mile wide. Their outer edge is 4^ miles south-eastward of the Grande Anquette beacon turret ; 6 miles from high-water mark on the French shore ; and, they appear above water at 4 hours ebb, some heads showing only at low water, and many more being always covered. In the vicinity of these rocks the ground is very foul and dangers are scattered in all directions, principally, however, northward, westward, and eastward of them; amongst them are depths of from 4 to 7 fathoms. The B\u0153uf rock, the highest rock of the group, is about one third from the eastern end of the Chaussee, and is marked by a beacon turret painted with red and white bands, 10 feet above high water, and surmounted by a mast and globe. The marks for this rock, which uncovers 18 feet at the lowest tides, are, Seymour tower, Jersey, touching the southern side of the Grande Anquette rock N.W. \u00a3 W. ; Icho tower on with Noirmont tower N.W. by W. \\ W. ; and, Hatain ville sand-hills seen between capes de Carteret and Flamanville.

Prince's tower a quarter of a point open southward of Mont Orgueil castle clears the northern end of the B\u0153uf patch ; Icho towrer its breadth open northward of Grande Anquette clears the southern end ; and, the B\u0153uf beacon turret S. by W. W. clears the western side. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels navigating in the northern vicinity of the Chaussee-des-B\u0153ufs between half ebb and half flood, the most dangerous time, must be careful to keep Bergerie house open north ward of Seymour tower, and Bouley signal-station a quarter of a point open northward of Rozel mill,* when it will be also just open of Rozel manor-house. Southward of the Anquettes and the B\u0153ufs, for a long distance, the sea is much encumbered by sunken rocks and banks of sand and gravel having from 4 to 6 fathoms over them ; indeed, from the southern Anquettes in the direction of Basse le Marie and the iles Chausey, scarcely a spot is quite free from one or the other, and in boisterous weather the whole of that space is one continuous sheet of broken water. The proper channels, lying eastward and westward of this accumulation of shoal ground, are pretty clear. The Chaussee-des-B\u0153ufs and Anquettes being so beset on all sides by danger, the utmost caution is necessary, especially in large vessels, to navigate with any degree of safety between or near them ; the best time is between half flood and high water, but there exists only one continuous leading mark for the passage between them, viz., the church of St. Pierre-les-Moutiers, which has a very low * In July, 1886, the arms of Rozel mill had been removed, rendering it difficult of recognition by a stranger. \u2014 Staff Capt.

The mark is useful, however, when coming from the northward, but too distant to be of much service when entering this passage from the southward, unless the weather is unusually clear. From the northward, the leading mark given must be carefully preserved until the white house at La Moye, Jersey, opens south ward of Le Fret point N.W. \\ W. ; or, until Coutances cathedral appears midway between Blainville and Agon churches E.S.E. ; and, it must always be remembered that both tides set obliquely across the vessel's course. St. GERMAIN BAY.\u2014 Anchorage.\u2014 This bay is formed by the land receding eastward between the Senequet rock and cape de Carteret ; it affords shelter in its northern part from winds between N.N.E. and S.E. in 5 fathoms, good holding ground of sandy clay ; but, southward of the Feles banks, vessels should nowhere approach the land nearer than 3^ miles, to avoid several patches of from 4 to 8 feet water only. The best anchorage is, with cape de Carteret light house about N. \\ E., and Pirou telegraph tower from S.E. to S.E. by E., but nothing southward of this latter bearing for fear of fouling the sub-marine telegraph cable. Telegraph cable. \u2014 The electric cable from Fliquet bay, Jersey, see page 249, runs direct to Pirou on the French coast, where the position of its shore end is marked by a tower and its direction at sea indicated by the tower being on with Pirou church steeple S.E. by E. E. The telegraph tower is easily recognized, as it stands quite alone near the beacon southward of St. Germain harbour ; it is white, 17 feet in diameter, 28 feet high, and surmounted by a green disc, on which is painted in large letters the word Telegraphe. Vessels should avoid anchoring or dredging anywhere near the line of the cable. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Germain at 6 h. 20 m. ; springs rise 34 feet, neaps 25 feet.

A sand-bank, one mile long North and South and half a mile wide, with from 4 to 8 feet water, lies two thirds of a mile westward of these rocks and 2 miles from the coast ; it is dangerous to vessels working up in-shore, and may be avoided by keeping Mont Gardon church steeple open northward of the guard-house of the battery on the western point of entrance to St. Germain N.E. \\ E. There are also two small sand-banks with 7 and 8 feet water over them between the Sac-de-Pirou and the Senequet rock ; in fact, at 2\\ miles from the shore, between the Senequet and St. Germain, the depth does not average more than 15 feet. Senequet lighthouse on with Ronquet beacon turret S. \\ W. westerly leads well outside this depth. GEFFOSSE, E.N.E. 3\u00a3 miles from Senequet lighthouse and 4^ miles southward of St. Germain, is a very small harbour, only capable of affording shelter to fishing boats of about 10 tons burthen ; it is quite open to W.N.W. and when it blows hard from that quarter there is a nasty tumbling sea at the entrance. St. GERMAIN-SUR- AY.\u2014 This little harbour lying N.E. by N. 7^ miles from Senequet rock lighthouse and S. by E. \\ E. 12 miles from cape de Carteret, admits vessels drawing 7 or 8 feet at high water, springs, but a vessel of that draught will be neaped within it for 5 or 6 days. The sand-banks, both inside the harbour and at the entrance, are so liable to shift that it is not prudent to enter without a pilot. It is well sheltered on all sides except from S.W. to South, and strong winds from that direction send in a heavy sea. The strand uncovers 1^ miles outside the entrance, and the Cabot with several other rocks rise from it exactly in the fairway.

The passage between the Banes Feles and the French coast is 2j miles wride, with patches of from 6 to 12 feet in it ; it is the channel generally used and the leading mark is good. That between the Taillepied and the Ecrehos rocks is 1^ miles wide, with a patch of 11 feet in its southern entrance, but no leading mark for it can be given ; from the great rapidity of the streams, there is generally a turbulent sea in this passage even in the finest weather, and in rough weather it is exceedingly dangerous for small vessels to attempt it. PORT BAIL.\u2014 The entrance to this harbour is 8 miles northward of St. Germain and S.S.E. \u00a3 E. 4^ miles from cape de Carteret lighthouse ; it is the best harbour between cape de la Hague and Granville, but its trade is quite insignificant and it is only accessible at spring tides for one hour before or after high water, and, at high water, neaps, boats of 6 feet draught cannot always enter. The bottom of the harbour is sand, which dries from half ebb to half flood."], [194, "[Chap. IV. 172 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. The entrance is not more than a cable wide and is open to the S.W. ; it is between the southern point of the harbour and La Caillourie, a sandy islet on which stands a Custom-house station and the outer leading light, on point Dune, its south-eastern end. The islet is from 25 to 30 feet above the level of the bottom of the harbour, and bears S.W. by W. \\ W. 5| cables from the village of Port Bail. South-eastward of it is a bed of pebbles and small stones about a cable in extent, which should be avoided ; and, southward of it, a rock which does not cover. The little river Grise discharges itself into the harbour. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed harbour lights are established at Port Bail, the inner red light being shown from the church tower, and the outer white light from a staff erected by a little white hut at point Dune, distant from the inner light S.W. by W. \\ W. 953 yards. The red light is visible in clear weather 9 miles, the white light 7 miles, and when in line they lead into port. The lights are visible 16\u00b0 on either side of the leading line ; they are brightest when in line, and their brilliancy decreases as the limit is approached. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the sand-hills at the outer northern point of entrance. Directions. \u2014 The leading mark into this harbour is, the two lights in line, or the steeple of Port Bail between the two mills of Cartelet N.E. by E. \\ E. The berth where the tide rises highest is on the bed of the fresh water stream E.N.E. and East of the southern point of entrance, but it is an uneasy position when it blows hard from N.N.W. ; here the tide rises from 16\u00a3 to 19\u00a3 feet at springs, but, in running in, the lead must be kept going to avoid the bank of the stream. The best berth, but with 2>\\ feet less water, is about 2 cables south-westward of the guard-house near the shore 3 cables S.S.E. of the church steeple ; here a vessel is sheltered on all sides except from W.N.W. Coasters, trading between here and Jersey, take up a position in the bed of the stream in front of the village. A black buoy marks the entrance of the channel, and, between it and the entrance points are some mooring buoys where vessels may moor head and stern in the direction of the channel ; the position, however, is completely exposed, and no vessel should make use of these buoys except in fine settled weather. The Jument and Grand Rocher are two rocks south-westward of the entrance to Port Bail. The first is at low- water mark, 1\\"], [195, "Chap, iv.] 173 PORT BAIL. \u2014 CAPE DE CARTERET. miles from the southern point of entrance, and uncovers 11^ feet ; the other is 1^ miles from the same point, about 7 cables southward of the Jument, and uncovers 14\u00a3 feet. Basses de Port Bail are three small rocky ledges and a small sand-bank fronting the entrance of Port Bail. The first has two rocky heads, each with 6 feet water, and lies about a mile from the shore, with Gouey steeple between Port Bail steeple and Caillourie islet E. \\ N. ; and, cape de Carteret lighthouse N. by W. \\ W. The second is very small, with 8 feet water, W.S.W. 4 cables from the first, and S. \\ E. easterly 4 miles from cape de Carteret lighthouse.

The small sand-bank has 8 feet water, and is about 1\u00a3 miles from the shore, with Gouey steeple on with the summit of Caillourie islet E. by N. \\ N. northerly. Several other rocky patches lie northward of the Basses de Port Bail, from half to three quarters of a mile outside low water mark, and in the direction of the entrance to Havre de Carteret. CAPE de CARTERET is the western extreme of the steep hill which bounds the entrance of de Carteret harbour on its western side. This hill is the first high land on the coast northward of Granville, and is separated from the high land of the interior by a valley nearly 600 yards wide, almost entirely filled by drift sand from the neigh bouring sand-hills. The cape is rather higher than Rosel point, 6 miles northward of it, and may be seen in clear weather 17 or 18 miles distant ; it terminates in an abrupt declivity, beneath which is a cliff of sloping rocks. The lighthouse, a square tower, stands about 100 yards eastward of the extreme of the cape, and a semaphore is near it. From the lighthouse, Granville lighthouse bears S. \\ W. westerly 33 miles ; cape de la Hague lighthouse N. \\ E. easterly 21\u00a3 miles, cape Flamanville and Nez de Jobourg projecting seaward of this line ; and, St. Catherine's breakwater lighthouse, Jersey, S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. 12 miles. LIGHT. \u2014 Cape de Carteret lighthouse exhibits a revolving ivhite light, the eclipses succeding each other every half minute, and not being total in ordinary weather within 8 miles. The light is of the second order, 262 feet above high water, visible in clear weather from a distance of 23 miles, and seldom hidden by fog."], [196, "174 [Chap. iv. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. HAVRE de CARTERET, a mile eastward of cape de Carteret and N.N.W. | W. 4 miles from Port Bail, admits vessels of 10 to 1H feet draught, at springs, for half an hour before and after high water. The entrance, about half a cable wide, is between two stone jetties, which cover at high water, springs, are above water at neaps, and are marked by beacons at their outer ends. The western jetty, commencing at the foot of the steep eastern part of the cape, is about 640 yards long ; the eastern jetty does not project quite so far seaward. The harbour is open to the southward, and during the time it is accessible the stream runs strongly across the entrance north-westward, but between the jetties it takes their direction until they cover, when it again runs across the direction of the channel at the surface. The ebb stream runs with great velocity out of the harbour. This little port is quite useless for purposes of shelter and the trade is insignificant ; supplies of any description can only be obtained with difficulty and in small quantities. It is 24 miles distant from Cherbourg by road, and is occasionally visited by small passenger steamers from St. Helier. Directions. \u2014 The leading mark for the channel into de Carteret harbour is, de Carteret steeple on with the door of the life-boat house. A small red buoy marks a bank nearly in mid-channel at the entrance ; there is, however, more water over the bank than over the berths in the harbour, but it is best to pass westward of the buoy where there are 3 feet more water than on the bank. When the inner part of the western jetty is awash there are 10 feet in the channel, but above this, where the grounding berths are, there are then only from 6 to 8 feet. A Life-Boat is stationed at Havre de Carteret, THE COAST.\u2014 Northward of cape de Carteret the coast is re markable from the white sand-hills of Hatainville, so useful to the mariner as a land-mark. Four miles northward of them is Rosel point, bluff and rocky, with dangerous reefs extending more than a mile from it; 3^ miles northward of it is cape Flamanville, also high and bluff ; the Anse de Sciotot, with a low and sandy shore in its southern part but high and rocky as cape Flamanville is approached, lying between them. Northward of cape Flamanville is port Dielette, and the extensive Anse de Vauville affording good shelter in easterly winds; the southern shore of this bay is low and sandy, rising to high land in the interior ; the northern part is high and rugged, terminating in"], [197, "Chap.

From this point, the land falls towards cape de la Hague, which is distant 3 miles and is low, sandy, and surrounded by off-lying dangerous rocks, on the highest of which, the Gros du Raz, stands the lighthouse. There are no hidden dangers in the offing between cape de Carteret and cape Flamanville except the Plateau des Trois-Grunes ; but, from the broad sandy beach between those capes, shallows, which must be avoided at low tide, extend off-shore from 1\u00a3 to 2\\ miles. The most prominent parts of these shallows are, the Roches du Rit, the Basse Bihard, the Caillou, and the Bane de Surtainville ; the first dries, the others break at the lowest tides. Northward of cape Flamanville, the offing is still clear of danger until the Nez de Jobourg is approached, south- west ward from which point, distant from 1 to 2^ miles and with a clear passage in-shore of them, are the Basses St. Gilles, Huquet de Jobourg, Huquets de Vauville, and other dangerous reefs, on which some heads uncover as much as 15 feet, and all of which may be avoided by keeping Rosel point well open of cape Flamanville. PLATEAU des TROIS-GRUNES.\u2014 The northern edge of this dangerous reef bears W. by N. \u00a3 N. 3\u00a3 miles from cape de Carteret lighthouse ; it is about a mile long N.W. and S.E., from 2j to 8 cables wide, and has from 6 to 9 fathoms round it. It consists of a dozen rocky heads, of which two uncover from 3 to 5 feet at the south-eastern extreme of the ledge and are half a cable apart. From the highest head, which dries 5 feet, cape de Carteret light house bears E. \u00a3 S. 3i miles ; the southern extreme of the roches du Rit E.

By Night, cape de la Hague light on with the Nez de Jobourg leads over the centre of the shoal ; the light well open westward of the Nez clears its western side. This is a useful mark from the northward in clear weather, but the light can seldom be seen so far southward as the Trois-Grunes. A bank of sand and broken shells lies 3^ miles north-westward of the Trois-Grunes, and 4^ miles N.E. by N. from the Drouilles shoals ; it has 9 fathoms on it and from 11 to 14 fathoms around, is about 4 cables long N.E. and S.W. and a cable wide, and is not of itself dangerous, but causes a strong overfall which small vessels should avoid when it is blowing fresh. Roches-du-Rit. \u2014 Between cape de Carteret and Rosel point, the sands uncover from one quarter to three quarters of a mile from the shore, and several rocky ledges rise from them, of which the most dangerous are the Roches-du-Rit, Their southern end is about 8 cables N.W. by N. from cape de Carteret lighthouse ; from thence, the outer part of the ledge extends N. by W. \\ W. one mile, termina ting in this direction 1\u00a3 miles N.N.W. from the lighthouse.

Care must be taken not to approach the cape too closely at low water, as rocky heads with only 4 or 5 feet water extend half a mile westward from the light house. BANC DE SURTAINVILLE consists of four long narrow ridges of sand and broken shells occupying a space lty miles long N.W and S.E., extending 2 miles from the shore, and in some measure united with the beach. There are from 18 to 22 feet on the two western ridges, 11 to 21 feet on the middle, and 19 feet on the south-eastern ridge. These little ridges lie athwart the streams and occasion a heavy sea when it is blowing fresh. Basse Bihard, the outermost of these dangers, is a small rocky flat north-westward of the Bane de Surtainville, with a narrow channel of 8 fathoms between them, 21r miles from the shore ; it is 1^ cables long N.W. and S.E., and three quarters of a cable wide, with only 6 feet water over its highest head ; from which, cape de Carteret lighthouse bears S. by E. \u00a3 E. h\\ miles ; Rosel point N.E. by E. \u00a3 E. 2^ miles ; and, Pieux church open northward of Rosel point and on with a remarkable red-tiled house near the beach N.E. \u00a3 E.

The point is skirted by rocks running off nearly 3 cables in a S.W. and 6^ cables in a N.N.W. direction from the foot of the cliffs, and, westward of it, there are less than 3 fathoms a mile from the point ; to avoid this foul ground, it should not be approached nearer than 1^ miles, nor within the depth of 10 fathoms. Anse de Sciotot, between Rosel point and cape Flamanville, affords shelter from winds between E.N.E. and S.E. in from 7 to 10 fathoms, sandy bottom. The shore is low and sandy from the head of the bay to Rosel point, but high and rocky towards cape Flamanville. Cape Flamanville is a high bluff point with a guard-house and semaphore on its summit ; from it, the Nez de Jobourg bears N. \u00a3 E. easterly about 9 miles. It should not be approached nearer than three quarters of a mile, nor within a depth of 10 fathoms, as it is skirted by dangers extending half a mile from the shore ; they, however, may be avoided by day or night by keeping cape de la Hague lighthouse in sight westward of the Nez.* High granite cliffs form the shore from cape Flamanville as far as Dielette, beyond which the low sandy shore of the Anse de Vauville commences. DIELETTE, in the southern part of Vauville bay 2 miles north-eastward of cape Flamanville, has two harbours sheltered from N.E. round by East and South to S.W. by the high land, and from S.W. round by West to North by the new granite pier constructed about 360 yards westward of the old pier, and form ing the outer harbour, which is exposed to so much swell and surf that it is very little used ; but the new pier breaks the sea and greatly increases the security of the old harbour, which, however, affords anything but good grounding places. The outer harbour has in its entrance a depth of 3 feet at low water, springs ; the outer pier extends from the shore in a northerly direction 252 yards to the Rognouse rocks, which there form its foundation, and then curves eastward 155 yards to the eastern part of those rocks. The channel between the end of this pier, on which stands a lighthouse, and the shore rocks northward of it, marked by a beacon near their edge, is about 164 yards wide. The bottom of the outer harbour consists of soft sand with a few ledges of rocks one to 6 feet above the sand, which rocks were being removed in May 1881. t * See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Cape Flamanville to St. Marcouf islands, No. 1106. f Commander C. V. Anson, H.M.S. Dasher."], [201, "Chap, iv.] DIELETTE. 179 The beacon on the northern side of the channel stands on a rock which uncovers 17 feet E. by N. \\ N. 197 yards from the end of the new pier, and N. \u00a3 W. 344 yards from the old pier-head. This rock is on the southern edge of the rocky bed joining the shore north eastward of the harbour, and which, in rough weather, greatly breaks the force of the sea. The channel lies in a north-westerly direction, and is narrowed by low rocky ledges, which uncover at low water a cable outside the beacon and new pier-head. In rough weather, these ledges cause a heavy sea, to be avoided by keeping in the direction of the channel, which, near the entrance of the old harbour, is suddenly narrowed by the Pierre de la Riviere, a rock dangerous to vessels working in ; it lies E. by N. \\ N. 95 yards from the old pier-head. The old or inner harbour admits vessels of about 10 or 12 feet draught, at springs ; but, the entrance is so surrounded by rocks that access to it is hazardous except at high water and with a leading wind. The pier forming the old harbour is about 186 yards in length. The entrance is 72 yards wide and open to the N.N.E. ; it is between the old pier-head and the extreme of a little pile of loose stones on the steep eastern shore of the harbour. The sand at the entrance dries 16 feet above the level of the lowest tides, and from thence the bottom, of hard sand and gravel, takes a gentle ascent to the level of high water, neaps. The best position for grounding is about two thirds the length of the pier from the pier head, but, as the bottom is hard, precautions must be taken to prevent the vessel falling over. Although such extensive works have been accomplished in the construction of this harbour, a few fishing boats only belong to the port and its trade is very insignificant, being represented by about 60 small coasters, averaging 40 tons, calling annually. A. Life-Boat is stationed at port Dielette. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed harbour lights are exhibited at port Dielette, and when in line S.S.E. \u00a3 E. easterly they lead through the channel to the harbour. The outer light, at the new pier-head, is a, fixed light, and shows white seaward on its opening of cape Flamanville all round to the bearing of S.S.E., and red towards the land, over the Huquets de Jobourg, and all the shoals south-westward of the Nez. When within the white light, therefore, a vessel is westward of and outside all danger. The light is 34 feet above high water, and in clear weather is visible from a distance of 9 miles. M 2"], [202, "180 [Chap. IV. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. The inner light is red and 75 feet above high water ; it stands on the shore and is shown from a mast on a wooden hut ; it is 510 yards S.S.E. \u00a3 E. easterly from the outer light, and is visible 13 miles. A small green light indicates the position of the old pier-head. Directions.\u2014 The direction of the channel leading to port Dielette is pointed out by the tops of two remarkable little conical hills, forming the northern boundary of the valley of Dielette. When within a mile of the port, open the summit of the hill on which are the ruins of an old semaphore a little northward of the summit of the other hill, and keep a good look out for the beacon, and for the lighthouse on the new pier. Steer to pass about half a cable northward of the lighthouse, and then, if bound into the old harbour, steer direct for the old pier-head, which round as closely as possible in order to avoid the Pierre de la Riviere. With moderate winds from West round by North to N.E., these directions can be followed from half an hour before to half an hour after high water by vessels drawing not more than 10 feet ; but, when the wind is fresh from that quarter, they can only enter at high water, springs. With the wind between West and South, a position should be gained south-westward of the harbour before bearing up for the lighthouse. With a head wind, the channel should not be attempted without a pilot. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port Dielette at 6 h. 40 m. ; springs rise 27 feet, neaps 20\u00a3 feet. The tide rises above the bottom at the entrance of the inner harbour, which dries 16 feet above the level of the lowest tides, 17 feet at extraordinary springs, 14 or 15 feet at ordinary springs, and about 4 or 5 feet at neaps. ANSE de VAUVILLE, between cape Flamanville and the Nez de Jobourg, affords good shelter against all winds from South round by East to N.E. in from 4 to 12 fathoms, fine hard sand. This bay is much resorted to by merchant vessels and coasters over taken by a calm, unable to save their tide through the Race of Alderney, or waiting for sufficient water to cross the flats southward of cape de Carteret ; they should, however, be prepared to weigh and gain an offing if the wrind veers to the westward. When the wind is off-shore, and particularly from the S.E., there is a heavy surf on the beach which renders landing impossible ; but, one mile from the shore the sea is smooth and there is but little swell. At the head"], [203, "Chap. IV.] ANSE DE VAUVILLE. \u2014 NEZ DE JOBOURG. 181 of the bay between Siouville and Vauville, distant from each other 4i miles, the shore at the foot of the high land is low and covered with sand-hills. NEZ DE JOBOURG.\u2014 From near Vauville, the coast rises and for about 4 miles consists of rugged cliffs 300 feet high, intersected by deep and narrow valleys, terminating westward in this high bluff promontory, 420 feet above the sea level, which may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 24 miles. There is a semaphore station on its summit, a small hummock, of which the slopes extend to the edge of the nearly perpendicular cliffs on its western side. About 1\u00a3 miles inland, eastward of the Nez, stands Jobourg church, a con spicuous and useful sea-mark. Northward of the Nez, 3 miles distant, is cape de la Hague, low and sandy ; and, south-eastward of it, the high rugged coast for 2\\ miles is bordered by rocks as far as 3 cables from the shore ; of these the most dangerous are, the Huitriere, the Sidman, the Foraine, the Brequets, and the Ronde. The three first uncover from 10 to 11 feet at the lowest tides, and the Ronde 15 feet ; ' the Brequets never cover. The Dossier e Rock. \u2014 The Nez de Jobourg is surrounded by a rocky barrier extending one mile north- westward and terminating in the Basses de la Dossiere, two rocky flats having only 9 feet water on them. The Dossiere rock, 4 cables northward of the Nez, uncovers 16 feet and is the highest rock of the barrier. It gives a useful indication to the local pilots of the state of tide in the offing, as it covers at about half tide by the shore, at which time the flood or northern stream begins to be felt round the Nez and in the Race of Alderney. The Greniquet rock on with the low point of cape de la Hague leads close westward of the foul ground surrounding the Nez. South-westward and southward of the Nez de Jobourg and occupying a space of nearly 2^ miles W.N.W. and E.S.E. are several dangerous shoals, with a passage between them and the coast, of which the principal are the Huquets de Jobourg, the Basses St. Gilles, the Huquets de Vauville, and the Calenfriers. HUQUETS de JOBOURG is the general name of the whole of this rocky range, which lies parallel with and about 1\u00a3 miles from the shore, between the bearings S.W. by W. and S. by E. from the Nez de Jobourg. The highest heads at its western and eastern extremes are, the Basses St. Gilles and Huquets de Vauville."], [204, "[Chap. IV. 182 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. Basses St. Gilles are three rocky heads at the western end ; on the highest, at the north-eastern point of the Basses, there are only 7 feet water. The western head, with 19 feet, lies at the western extreme ; and the third, a small isolated rock with 5 fathoms, lies a quarter of a mile southward of the 7-feet rock. Huquets de Jobourg. \u2014 The highest rock on the central part or Huquets de Jobourg proper, between which and the St. Gilles is a passage half a mile wide with from 9 to 11 fathoms, uncovers 13 feet, The Calenfriers, two small rocks at the north-western part of the reef, uncover 2 feet. Huquets de Vauville are one third of a mile eastward of the Huquets de Jobourg and form the eastern extreme of the range ; they are of small extent, and the highest head which uncovers 15 feet, is considered a half tide rock by the pilots, who, when awaiting in Vauville bay the most favourable moment to cross Alderney race, weigh when its summit is about 2 feet above water, and gain an offing in order to pass westward of the St. Gilles. Clearing Marks. \u2014 Rosel point well open of cape Flamanville S. \u00a3 E. leads 6 cables westward of the Basses St. Gilles ; and cape de la Hague lighthouse on with the summit of the Greniquet rock N. by E. \u00a3 E. easterly leads a quarter of a mile eastward of the 7-feet head, midway between it and the Huquets de Jobourg. By night, keeping within the white sector of Dielette pier-head light leads south-westward of all the dangers. When running through the Race of Alderney from the southward, it is prudent not to shut in Rosel point, and at night not to bring cape de la Hague light more northerly than N.E. \\ N. unless within an hour of high water, until well clear of these rocks. CAUTION. \u2014 The flood or north-eastern stream begins to gain strength when the Huquets de Vauville and the Dossiere rock cover, and runs with great rapidity towards the dangers just described, and over the rocky barrier surrounding the Nez de Jobourg ; a sailing vessel, therefore, entering the channel, one mile wide, which separates the Huquets de Jobourg from the coast, is liable to be set on this barrier, unless the wind is favourable and sufficiently strong to ensure her stemming the stream.

With the wind between East and South, the best shelter is under the high land of cape Flamanville on the southern side of the bay ; in rounding that cape, however, from the southward, care must be taken to avoid the foul ground off it, which, at night, may be done by keeping cape de la Hague light in sight westward of the Nez, or by not standing into less than 10 fathoms until well north ward of the cape, when a berth may be taken up by a bearing of port Dielette white pier-head light, observing that the light turns to red if brought southward of S.S.E. CAPE DE LA HAGUE,* the north-western extreme of Normandy, 3 miles northward of the Nez de Jobourg, is low and sandy. From it, the eastern extreme of Alderney bears W. by N. \u00a3 N. 8J miles, and the western end of Cherbourg break water is 11^ miles distant on a S.E. by E. bearing. The most con spicuous objects in the vicinity of the cape are, the lighthouse on the Gros du Raz rock W. \\ S. half a mile from the cape, the tower of Jobourg church, the village of Auderville with its small church tower, not easily distinguished, and the church of St. Germain de Vaux with its square tower surmounted by a spire. LIGHT. \u2014 From the lighthouse on the Gros du Raz, the largest rock in the vicinity of cape de la Hague, is exhibited, at 154 feet above high water, a fixed ivhite light, visible in clear weather from a distance of 18 miles. The light is dioptric, of the first order, and is seldom obscured by fog or mist. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at cape de la Hague at 7h 6m. Springs rise 21^ feet ; neaps 18 feet, Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore at Cape de la Hague ; the station, known by the yellow house of the keeper and the white mast, is on a low sand-hill at the extreme of the cape. * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 British islands to Mediterranean Sea, No. 1 ; scale m = 002 of an inch.

IV. 184 DANGERS surrounding Cape de la Hague\u2014 From l\\ miles southward of the lighthouse to the roches du Houses, one mile eastward of the cape, the coast is skirted by many dangers, rendered all the more formidable by the violence of the tidal streams in their vicinity. Local pilots, under favourable circumstances, sometimes take vessels of less than 15 feet draught alongshore between the detached rocks and the beach, for, during fine weather, the tides there are less rapid and the sea less disturbed than in the wide channel of the Alderney Race. No vessel, however, should attempt this passage without an experienced pilot. The principal dangers in the vicinity are the Greniquet, Diotret, Foraine, and Noires ledges, lying westward and southward of the cape ; and, the Grunes, Becchue, Ronde, and Houffet rocks, lying northward and eastward of it. The Greniquet, of which the summit is 8 feet above high water, springs, is 3 cables from the shore abreast of Calenfrier, and S. by W. \u00a3 W. westerly one mile from the lighthouse. The Diotret bears N.N.E. 3J cables from the Greniquet, and its summit, which is 26^ feet above low water, is covered at high equinoctial tides. The Foraine, the westernmost rock, is nearly a mile from the shore immediately fronting the little harbour of Goury, and W. \u00a3 S. three quarters of a mile from the lighthouse, with Cape de la Hague semaphore appearing thrice the width of the lighthouse south ward of it. The rock is of a conical form, uncovers 14 feet, and, being a half -tide rock, is a valuable guide for the state of the tidal streams ; for, as with the Dossiere near the Nez de Jobourg, when it covers, the north-eastern stream begins to be felt in the Race of Alderney, and the south-western stream when it uncovers ; this rock is, however, extremely dangerous to vessels passing in its vicinity, on account of the streams setting directly over it. The steeple of Pieux church, on the high land eastward of cape Flamanville, on with the large rock forming the extreme of the Nez de Jobourg leads 3 cables westward of the Foraine, but this church being 13 miles distant from the rock, is visible in very clear weather only. The valley of the Dielette open westward of the Nez de Jobourg, or Flamanville church steeple midway between cape Flamanville and the Nez, also leads westward of the Foraine rock."], [207, "Chap, iv.] DANGERS ROUND CAPE DE LA HAGUE. 185 Buoy. \u2014 An automatic whistle buoy, painted red, is moored with the Foraine rock bearing South a little easterly about 3 cables, and cape de la Hague lighthouse E. \u00a3 S. about 8 cables. The Noires. \u2014 The space north-eastward of the Foraine, between it and the Gros du Raz, is filled with shoals and rocks called the Noires, of which the highest, midway between the lighthouse and the Foraine, uncovers 21 feet. The Galet, a sunken rock with only one foot water, lies N.N.E. half a mile from the lighthouse. The Grunes. \u2014 The Grande Grune, a dangerous reef with only 2 feet water on the shoalest part, lies N.E. by N. about three quarters of a mile from the lighthouse and half a mile from the shore. The Petite Grune is about 3-^ cables eastward of the Grande Grune ; it is about a quarter of a mile in length N.E. and S.W., and has on its middle two rocky heads which uncover about a foot. It is about half a mile from the shore, and the sea breaks with great fury during a weather tide both on it and on the Grande Grune. The Becchue, a large rock about 4 cables from the shore and E. by N. 1-f miles from the lighthouse, is the northernmost of all the rocks which do not cover between the lighthouse and St. Martin bay ; its summit rises 4 feet above the level of high water, springs. At low water, a number of rocky heads appear in a curcuit of a quarter of a mile around the Becchue ; the Porchet, the westernmost of these heads, uncovers 4 feet and is about midway between the Becchue and Petite Grune. The Ronde, N.E. by N. 2 cables from the Becchue, uncovers 5 feet and is the outermost rock in this direction. At 4 cables S.E. by E. from the Becchue is the outer extreme of the Houffet rocks, on which are several heads 3 or 4 feet above the level of high water, springs. Clearing Marks. \u2014 Cape de la Hague lighthouse on with the pitch of the cliff of the Nez de Jobourg leads a quarter of a mile westward of the Grande Grune. The north-eastern extreme of the Houffet rocks on with the Esquina rock near the eastern shore of St. Martin bay, the largest and highest of all the rocks near the coast between cape de la Hague and Omonville, bearing S.E. E., leads a cable northward of the northern head of the Petite Grune. The"], [208, "186 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. [Chap. IV. Esquina rock on with Nacqueville church steeple S.E. S. leads north ward of the Houffets, 3^ cables northward of the Ronde, and three quarters of a mile northward of the Grunes. GOURY. \u2014 This little harbour, or grounding place on a beach of pebbles and gravel at the head of a small elbow in the shore, is about half a mile southward of cape de la Hague lighthouse ; it is sheltered by the land from winds from N.N.W. round by North and East to S.S.W., and protected from the heavy swell which sometimes rolls in from the westward by a stone jetty about 123 yards in length, and by the rocks upon which it is built. The harbour affords a useful shelter for small coasters, and the supplies for the lighthouse are embarked from it, but it has no trade of the least importance. The entrance, bearing E. | N. 3 cables from the Diotret rock, is between two large rocks joining the shore ; that on the southern side, named Jet d'Amont, is awash at high water, neaps ; and, that on the northern side, Jet d'Aval, is about 2 feet above that level. The harbour dries 11 or 12 feet above the lowest tides, has from 10 to 15 feet water at high water, springs, and from 6 to 7 feet at neaps, but it is inaccessible during strong N.W. or S.W. winds on account of the heavy sea ; in any case, since it can only be entered at high water, that is to say, when the stream is at its greatest speed in the Race of Alderney, the approach to it must always be difficult and often dangerous, and no vessel should attempt it without a pilot. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Goury harbour, at 7 h. 6 m. ; springs rise 22 feet, neaps 17\u00a3 feet. A Life-Boat is stationed at Goury. DIRECTIONS\u2014 COTENTIN PASS AGE\u2014 Between Cape de la Hague and Granville. \u2014 This passage is along the western coast of the peninsula of Cotentin and over the sandy flat which extends from the shore nearly the whole of the distance between cape de Carteret and Granville. Coasters use it at all times of tide, but sailing vessels of deep draught bound to Granville seldom attempt it, as it can only be done with a leading wind sufficiently strong to stem the flood stream with which they have to contend at the time that harbour is accessible, and they must also wait for water over the flats between the Banes Feles and the coast ; large vessels generally take the Deroute channel, passing westward of Jersey and of the Minquiers. The streams in the Cotentin passage run nearly parallel with the"], [209, "Chap. IV.] GOURY. \u2014 COTENTIN PASSAGE. 187 shore, their strength, at springs, being from 4 to 5 knots, and from 2\\ to 3 knots at neaps. Winds between South and East are the most favourable for entering the passage from the southward, and between North and East from the northward. In fine weather, a vessel bound northward may run through it with the wind from South to S.W., and, if bound southward, with the wind from North to N.W. ; but, it is imprudent to enter it from either direction with the wind blowing strongly between S.W. and N.W., or in thick weather. In running through this passage from the northward, it must be borne in mind that the south-western stream begins to be felt in the Race of Alderney at half ebb by the shore at cape de la Hague, or about 4 hours after high water at Granville or St. Malo ; and, that even if the Race is passed through during the last of the north eastern stream, it is quite impossible to reach Granville before low water in the passage, at which time there is not sufficient depth for a vessel of deep draught over the flat between the Banes Feles and the shore, and she must of necessity anchor to wait for sufficient water, which there will not be until at least one quarter flood, at springs, when there are about 24 feet in the fairway with the leading mark on, and 7 feet over the shoalest part of the Banes Feles. Anchorage. \u2014 Several anchorages with fair shelter against easterly winds exist along this coast, but the leading marks should be care fully attended to ; and, in case of thick weather wdien these cannot be discerned, vessels should anchor in such a depth as to allow for the fall of the tide, which, along this coast, is as much as from 30 to 42 feet at equinoctial springs, and from 14 to 20 feet at ordinary neaps, the greatest rise and fall being experienced as a vessel pro gresses southward. If waiting for water to cross the Feles flats, anchorage may be found, as already described, in Vauville or Sciotot bays, or under cape de Carteret. The best position at the latter place is in 4 or 5 fathoms, with the lighthouse just open westward of the fort on the western pitch of the cape, and distant about 2 miles. There is anchorage also farther South in Port Bail, St. Germain, and Regneville roads, but these can be used by small vessels only, as there are not more than from 2\\ to 3 fathoms in either at low water. From the Northward, having passed through the Race, and having given the Nez de Jobourg a berth of at least 3 miles to avoid the Huquets de Jobourg, steer for cape Flamanville, and from thence, as the vessel advances southward, keep the perpendicular point of the Nez well open westward of cape Flamanville, so as to"], [210, "[Chap. IV. 188 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. have cape de la Hague lighthouse also open of the Nez, which leads westward of the Basse Bihard, the outer patch of the Bane de Surtain ville, and westward of the Roches-du-Rit. When abreast of the latter, Port Bail and Gouey churches come in sight southward of cape de Carteret, then haul in gradually towards the land to avoid the Trois-Grunes and to shut in the north-western peak of the lofty light-coloured sand-hills of Hatainville, with the dark, bluff, and nearly perpendicular point of cape de Carteret N. \u00a3 E., which is the fairway mark between the Banes Feles and the coast, see also page 171, leading over the tail of these banks in from 12 to 15 feet at the lowest tides. If there is water enough to proceed, keep this leading mark on, passing 3 or 4 cables eastward of the red and black bell buoy marking the Jourdan ridge, and westward of the foul ground off the Senequet rock lighthouse ; but, in passing this foul ground, the vessel must haul to the westward a little and Hatainville sand-hills must be again opened out. Cape Flamanville on with cape de Carteret leads just clear south eastward of the tail of the Banes Feles in deeper water than the leading mark given ; but, if this latter mark is used, directly the banks have been passed the Hatainville sand-hills should be brought on with cape de Carteret as before. Rosel point in sight westward of cape de Carteret leads nearly midway between the Jourdan ridge and the foul ground off the Senequet, but at this distance Rosel point, having high land behind it, is not always well defined. When passing the Senequet rock, having hauled to the westward as described, steer to bring Champeaux point just open of pointe du Roc, Granville, bearing South, which, if the state of the tide and the vessel's draught admit, leads up to pointe du Roc, in-shore of the Catheue banks ; but, as the vessel advances southward, if there is not sufficient water over the banks, look out for the remarkable trees on Mont Huchon, about 2 miles northward of Coutances, and do not bring them on with Agon church until the Etat beacon turret, Chausey, is on with the iles des Huguenans S. by W. \\ W. This mark leads westward of Catheue banks, and when Coutances cathedral comes on with Bee d'Agon or Agon point, steer towards Granville, and, after passing the Canue rock, keep the Etat well open northward of it until Mont St. Michel is within twice its breadth of Champeaux point bearing S. \\ E., or until Coutances cathedral is on with Mont Martin church N.E. by E. \\ E., either of which marks lead eastward of the Admiralty bank. When Chausey lighthouse opens southward of the iles des"], [211, "Chap, iv.] COTENTIN PASSAGE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 189 Huguenans W. by N. 4. N., haul up for it to avoid the Haguet bank, or anchor if there is not sufficient w^ater to enter Granville. As early as 2 hours' flood there will be 11 feet over the Catheue, the Founet, and the Haguet banks. French pilots generally proceed through the Cotentin passage as follows : \u2014 By day, run through Alderney Race if possible during the last of the north-eastern stream : then, if the vessel's draught be not too great to pass without risk between the Banes Feles and the land at low water, steer to the southward for cape Flamanville, and, passing it, bring Jobourg church steeple on with the extreme of the cape N. by E. \\ E. ; this mark kept very carefully on leads eastward of the Basse Bihard, and of the Caillou rock, and over the Bane de Surtainville in not less than 3 fathoms. When the steeples of Port Bail and Gouey open of cape de Carteret steer S.S.E., so as to be about 2\\ miles from that cape when it is on with cape Flamanville bearing North. From thence, capes de Carteret and Flamanville in line lead between the Banes Feles and the main, and as far southward as the Senequet ; but, when abreast of St. Germain, a vessel may sheer in a little towards the coast and anchor north-westward of the Sac-de- Pirou rocks, to avoid the strength of the northern stream ; or, if the wind is strong enough, she can proceed, steering about S. by W. \\ W. to pass midway between the Jourdan and the western extreme of the foul ground off the Senequet, In case the bell buoy marking the Jourdan should be out of position, she will be certain of passing eastward of that shoal by keeping the Hatainville sand-hills shut in by cape de Carteret. As soon as Coutances cathedral is on with Blainville church, steer S.W. between the Marie ledge and the northern extreme of the Catheue banks, and continue on this course until Agon church tower is on with Mont Huchon E. i N., or until the beacon turrets on the Huguenans and the Etat are made out ; when, kept in line, they lead up in the fairway. If bound to Granville, run on with these beacon turrets in line until the Tombelaine rock opens a sail's breadth west ward of Champeaux point S. \u00a3 E. ; keep it so, and after passing the Founet, marked by a red bell buoy, steer for the harbour according to wind and tide. This latter mark is generally used by the pilots, as they consider it leads in the deepest water over the sandy bed north-westward of Granville and over the bar which unites Le Roc with the Chausey islets, and also clears the dangers eastward of these islets as well as those surrounding pointe du Roc"], [212, "[Chap. IV. 190 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. At Night, when through Alderney Race, and having given the Nez de Jobourg a berth of at least 3 miles, steer towards cape Flamanville ; as that cape is approached, keep cape de la Hague light opening and shutting in with the Nez N. by E. easterly, which mark leads a safe distance westward of the Basse Bihard, but directly towards the Trois-Grunes. To avoid these latter, when cape de Carteret light bears S.E. by S. steer towards it on that bearing for H miles, when the vessel will be about 34; miles from the light and H miles from the north-western edge of the Roches-du-Rit, From thence, steer S. by W. until the light bears E. | N., then S.S.E. \\ E. until it bears North, when keep it on that bearing and steer South past the south-eastern end of the Banes Feles, of which banks the vessel will be clear as soon as Port Bail leading lights are in line bearing N.E. by E. \\ E.

See page 157. Cotentin Passage from the Southward.\u2014 Vessels from Granville bound to harbours eastward of cape de la Hague or on the northern side of the English channel, if their draught admits and with a leading wind, generally run through the Cotentin passage. For this purpose, Granville harbour should be left directly the vessel floats, and, as there is then plenty of water inside the Catheue banks, when clear of the foul ground surrounding pointe du Roc, they may haul to the eastward until Champeaux point just open of pointe du Roc bears South, which mark should be followed until Coutances cathedral appears half way between Agon and Blainville churches. Or, they may take the outer passage by keeping Tombelaine islet a sail's breadth open westward of Champeaux point S. \u00a3 E., which mark leads westward of the Catheue banks, and eastward of the"], [213, "Chap, iv.] 191 COTENTIN PASSAGE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS.

When Coutances cathedral is on with Agon church tower, haul in towards the land, steering about N.E. to pass between the Jourdan ridge and the foul ground off the Senequet. A good look-out should now be kept for the red and black bell buoy on the Jourdan, and, when seen, steer to pass a little eastward of it. If the weather is clear, Hatainville sand-hills shut in with cape de Carteret N. \u00a3 E., when cape Flamanville will be half a point open westward of cape de Carteret, leads clear of the Jourdan and B\u0153uf patch and up to the tail of the Banes Feles. If the weather should be hazy and cape Flamanville not distinctly seen at this distance, from about 2 miles westward of the Senequet lighthouse steer N. by E. \\ E., taking care not to open Hatainville sand-hills westward of cape de Carteret. When abreast of St. Germain, steer North or a little more westerly, to bring capes de Carteret and Flamanville in line before reaching the parallel of the entrance to Surville. These capes in line, bearing North, lead up to cape de Carteret, but as soon as the steeple of St. Pierre les Moutiers is on with the slope of the eastern part of the hill of cape de Carteret N.E. \u00a3 N., or when within about 2 miles of the cape, steer N.W. until the Nez de Jobourg is a quarter of a point open westward of cape Flamanville N. \\ E. easterly, or until Jobourg church steeple is on with the extreme of cape Flamanville N. by E. + E. ; either of which marks, followed exactly, lead over the Bane de Surtainville in from 2 to 3 fathoms and up to an anchorage in Sciotot bay ; should Vauville bay be preferred, give cape Flamanville a berth of three quarters of a mile in rounding, to avoid the rocks and overfalls off it, and take up a berth according to the direction of the wind. See pages 181-183, and 187. The southern stream begins to be felt off cape Flamanville about 2\\ hours later than in the south-eastern entrance to the Cotentin passage, whence it follows that a vessel in running through this passage 2 hours before high water at Granville and sailing at the rate of 6^ or 7 knots, will, at springs, reach cape Flamanville or the anchorage in Sciotot bay before the southern tide makes. But at neaps this passage can rarely be accomplished in one tide by a sailing vessel, unless with a strong leading wind.

VARIATION IN 1888, 17\u00b0 50' W. GENERAL REMARKS.\u2014 A section of Jersey, if taken from North to South, would decline nearly in the form of a wedge, of which the highest part would be the northern shore, whereas a section of Guernsey would decline in a contrary direction, or from South to North ; yet these distinguishing features do not immediately appear on sighting these islands from the westward. Seen from that direction, at a distance, both islands appear level ; the low land of Braye du Valle in Guernsey, and that of St. Clement in Jersey, being yet below the horizon. The outline of Guernsey, however, is some what more irregular than that of Jersey, and its western shore has more verdure, and appears of a deeper shade than Jersey, whose western shores have suffered considerably from the encroachments of the sea sand ; so much so, that the colour of the land between Corbiere and Etac points is affected by it.* Both islands may be seen in clear weather from a distance of 25 miles. As the land is approached from the westward, however, the northerly slope of the land in Guernsey, as contrasted with its southerly slope in Jersey, should prevent the possibility of either island being mistaken for the other. Winds and Weather. \u2014 The prevailing winds of the English channel, see page 2, are those which affect the weather of the Channel islands ; local causes, however, produce certain modifications, and it may be useful to give the result of local observation and experience. Winds from S.S.E. round by South to W.N.W. are prevalent during the winter months, and the latter predominate ; fortunately, against the severity of this wind both Jersey and Guernsey offer good shelter for shipping. During the summer months and equinoxes, the winds are variable and uncertain. * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Channel islands, Nos. 2,669 a, b ; scale m = 0'5 inch and, Jersey island, No. 62 a, b, and e with Views ; scale m = it) inches. Note. \u2014 The soundings in this Chapter are reduced to a zero corresponding with the range of a 37 feet tide ; the lowest tide registered in Jersey between 1861 and 1869 fell 22 inches below that level. A 2771. Wt. 7242. N"], [216, "[Chap. v. 194 THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. When easterly winds set in during the winter season, they are thought to last longer and to blow with more uniformity in this neighbourhood than elsewhere. Southerly and south-westerly winds, during that period, are almost always accompanied or followed by stormy weather, which seldom or never clears up until the wind veers to North-west, as it usually does. The weather in the vicinity of Alderney does not always correspond with that at Jersey and Guernsey ; it being frequently local or peculiar to itself, owing perhaps to its proximity to the north-western angle of the French coast at Cape de la Hague, or to the island being in the very vortex of the tides, which are there in a constant state of rotation, especially at new and full moon. At those times, a difference of four points in the direction of the wind has been experienced ; viz., an E. by N. wind at Guernsey and Serk, and a N.E. by N. wind at Alderney, both blowing at the same time during a south-western tide, lightly or moderately in the neighbourhood of the former, while vessels near Alderney were under double-reefed sails. During the north-eastern stream, the wind has often been observed to be S.W. by W. at Alderney, while at Herm it was West, with similar variety in strength ; and this without any perceptible cause, the attraction of the tides or deflection caused by the French coast line excepted, or any difference in the barometer at the two places. Southerly, south-easterly, northerly, and north-easterly winds also invariably blow from Alderney in strong irregular gusts ; more parti cularly the first and last. Gales from S.W. and N.W. send in the heaviest sea amongst the islands, to which the strength of the tides greatly contributes ; the worst period is from half flood to half ebb, after which the western stream keeps much of the sea out in the offing. Refraction. \u2014 To show the variable effects of refraction caused by atmospheric conditions, it may be noticed that from a station near Verclut guard-house in Jersey, the top of the south-eastern battlement of Seymour tower should exactly coincide with the line of the visible horizon at low water, equinoctial spring tides ; sometimes, however, when viewed from this position, it has appeared considerably below that line, and in several instances above it. In this case the line of sight passes over the rocky surface of the Violet bank, over the sandy strand in its vicinity, and over the sea beyond, being at a mean height of 64 feet above it. Similiar variations in refraction have been observed on the French coast opposite, between the steeples of Coutances cathedral and the summits of the trees in that neighbour hood, and also in the vicinity of Cancale."], [217, "Chap. V.] WINDS AND WEATHER. \u2014 APPROACHES. \u2014 SOUNDINGS. 195 The Approaches to the Channel islands present'jpeculiar diffi culties to the stranger. The outlying rocks fronting their coasts, the strength and ever varying direction of the tidal stream, and the rough sea occasioned by it in bad weather, are all elements of danger ; the mariner may, however, overcome these difficulties by careful study of the charts and attention to the sailing directions. Soundings. \u2014 Near and between the Channel islands there is nothing remarkable in the soundings, either in depth or quality of ground, to assist the mariner uncertain of his position. But, for vessels approaching from the westward in thick weather, it may be useful to note the following facts : viz., that a depth of 35 fathoms keeps a vessel in the offing, outside or westward of the Roches- Douvres and Guernsey ; that there are as much as 33 fathoms between Guernsey and the Casquets, close to the Casquet S.W. bank on which there are as little as 4 fathoms ; and that, although on some small gravel knolls near Hurd's Deep, apparently heaped up temporarily by the combined action of gales and tides, there may have been found at times as little as 20 fathoms, such knolls, if they exist, may be easily distinguished from the large banks near and amongst the islands by their inferior size and by the greater surrounding depths. An increase of depth from 40 to 50, or to 65 fathoms, indicates a position N.W. of Guernsey, somewhere in the western part of Hurd's Deep ; and, depths of from 70 to nearly 100 fathoms are obtained only northward of the Casquets and Alderney, in the eastern part of the Deep. The bottom of Hurd's Deep is remarkable for large patches of black mud, although there is also much rocky ground and other substances. Between the Deep and the islands, and amongst them, the ground has no distinctive character, but consists of rock, gravel, granitic sand, and other coarse ground ; near the banks, however, and round their bases, it is generally of fine sand. Eastward of the Channel islands, from Alderney down to Jersey, the soundings are a safe guide in approaching the French coast to within a reasonable distance. A line drawn from the eastern end of one to the other of these islands is nearly parallel with the French coast and distant from it about 9 miles ; at the northern part of this line, near Alderney, there are 23 fathoms over clean ground, decreasing to 15 or 16 fathoms as Jersey is approached, with some deeper w-ater, coarse rotten ground, and occasionally oyster beds. Eastward of this line, the water shoals very gradually towards the French coast, and southward of Jersey the numerous reefs render all approach to that coast very hazardous. N 2"], [218, "196 [Chap. V. THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. Heavy gales cause considerable temporary alterations in the outlying sand-banks and exposed beaches of the islands ; south westerly gales heaping up large quantities of sand and shingle, and north-easterly gales washing them away again. It is well known that the Chateau and Ecreviere banks, eastward of Jersey, vary in height as much as 6 feet from this cause ; and, it is probable, therefore, that the Bane de la Schole, the Casquet bank, and others, vary from similar causes. All these variable banks, however, consist of fine sand and gravel, with sharp narrow ridges ; they are not, therefore, very dangerous to shipping, except from the confused sea and tide ripples over them in bad weather. TIDAL STREAMS.*\u2014 Near Guernsey, and northward of that island', the true Channel stream prevails ; the great body of the flood running about E. by N. whilst the tide is rising at Dover, and the ebb W.S.W. when it is falling at that place ; but, near to and south eastward of the Roches-Douvres, the flood stream sets S.E. into the gulf of St. Malo, and the ebb N.W. out of it ; the change there taking place an hour after high and low water by the shore, and near the time of half Hood and half ebb at Dover. Thus what is called tide and half tide prevails at Guernsey and amongst the islands to the N.E., whilst at Jersey, and along the southern shore of the gulf, as well as westward near the Roches- Douvres, the stream is more regular ; the former resulting from the direct action of the channel stream, the latter from an interruption of the southern portion of that stream by the coast of France, and its diversion into the gulf of St. Malo. The centre of the Deroute channel, between the Roches-Douvres and Guernsey, may be considered to mark the separating boundary of these two streams, for, along this line and to the eastward they run side by side, blending and separating in varying direction and force according to the state of the tide. It should be noted that the tidal stream around and between the Channel islands changes in direction by a rotary motion from right to left, the changes being apparently caused by the differences in the action of the two streams just described, and by the peculiar form of the shores of the gulf ; that is to say, the direction of the stream makes a complete circuit of the compass in a little over 12 hours, or in the duration of an ebb and a flood tide. It is also worthy of remark that the action of the streams near the northern and southern parts of the gulf, are nearly the * S\u0153 also Tidal streams, pages 265-267 and 271-274."], [219, "Chap, v.] TIDAL STREAMS. 197 reverse of each other ; there being slack water from Roches-Douvres eastward along the southern shores of the gulf when the stream is running at its maximum rate northward of cape de La Hague and Alderney, and vice versa. About the time of half ebb at Dover and first quarter flood by the shore at Guernsey, the stream sets sharply into the gulf on both sides and continues to run in south-eastward until half flood by the shore, and slack and change of stream in the offing, both of which occur almost simultaneously with low water at Dover. A division of the Deroute stream now takes place ; the northern part sweeping E.N.E. through the Deroute, Russell, Swinge, and Race channels, and then uniting with the east-going Channel stream northward of Alderney ; the southern part, near the Roches-Douvres, setting into the gulf south-eastward past Jersey and the Minquiers until near high water by the shore ; after which, although the main body of the stream to the southward slacks, its northern border turns off north eastward past Jersey and then northward, rejoining the Deroute stream. Close along the southern shore of the gulf, the ebb stream begins to run out westward soon after high water ; farther out in the Channel, but within the Roches-Douvres, an hour later ; at a position 8 miles N.W. of the Roches-Douvres, the stream changes at 2 hours ebb ; and, farther northward, near Guernsey, as already noticed, the slack and change of stream take place soon after half ebb by the shore, at which time also the south-western stream makes down through the Race, Swinge, and Russell channels, and through the Deroute channel between the Pierres de Lecq or Paternosters and Serk. In the offing westward of Guernsey, the stream seldom exceeds 3 knots until that island is approached, near which it sometimes attains the rate of 4| knots. In the Russell channels, it exceeds 5 knots, and it runs at about the same rate between Jersey and the Minquiers, and nearly 4 knots in the centre of the Deroute channel between Jersey and Serk. The Race and Swinge streams sometimes attain the rate of 7 knots or more. The average duration of the north-eastern stream is 5\u00a3 hours, and of the south-western stream 6\u00a3 hours. The rapidity with which the tides rise and fall, and their velocity, are greatly influenced by the wind ; strong north-eastern gales retarding and south-western gales accelerating their progress in a very remarkable degree. South-westerly gales also cause the Race stream to run three quarters of an hour longer north-eastward than it otherwise would do, though north-easterly gales have not a similar effect upon the south-western stream."], [220, "198 [Chap. V. THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. The tides put in and take off in all this neighbourhood very sud denly, and the general run of springs takes place about half an hour earlier than neaps ; the strength and direction of the wind making a difference of 2 or 3 feet in the rise or fall of the tide. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Helier, Jersey, at 6 h. 29 m., mean spring range 31^ feet ; at Guernsey at 6 h. 37 m., mean spring range 26 feet ; and, at Alderney, at 6 h. 46 m., mean spring range 17+. feet. Caution. \u2014 In approaching the Channel islands, constant and careful allowance should be made for the set of the tidal stream. If from the westward, and being southward of the parallel of Alderney, a south-easterly set may with certainty be expected, which will increase in intensity as Guernsey is neared ; and, between that island and the Roches-Douvres, a considerable indraught is always found, especially with north-westerly gales. If a vessel should happen to be near the islands during a long winter's night, but westward withal, the following observations might be worth consideration. With northerly, north-westerly, or westerly winds, it is not prudent to lay her head north-eastward betw*een low water and half flood unless the depth of water exceeds 34 fathoms, because at that time the wind and tide unite in driving the ship south-eastward. With southerly, south-westerly, or westerly winds, it is equally imprudent to lay a vessel's head south-eastward between half flood and high water, and for a similar reason, both wind and tide then driving her north-eastward. With easterly winds the islands become a weather shore, and may consequently be made free with as occasion may require ; and, by attention to the set of the streams, a position taken before dark may be preserved within 3 or 4 miles, if a vessel can carry close-reefed topsails and foresail ; what is lost on one tide being nearly regained on the other, if the wind enables her to lie across either. This calculation may be made with a degree of certainty off St. Malo, Granville, or cape Flamanville. When making the Casquets or any of the rocks or islands in thick foggy weather, never run close home with the stream, but wait until the turn of the tide would set you off-shore in the event of getting suddenly into danger. In westerly gales, avoid passing close to windward of any of the banks on a weather tide ; and, it is well to remember that at such times, with the western stream running in the offing, there is a very heavy se westward of the islands, but comparatively smooth water"], [221, "Chap, v.] 199 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 JERSEY. within them and along the coast of France ; so that a vessel leaving Alderney at 2 hours ebb, and pushing through the Race before the W.S.W. stream makes down, may run a considerable distance towards Jersey in smooth water. On entering or leaving any of the narrow channels between the islands, be careful to make early allowance for the different sets of tide sure to be met with at such places. JERSEY, ITS APPROACHES AND ADJACENT DANGERS. JERSEY. \u2014 The form of this island is that of a parallelogram, its greatest length E.S.E. and W.N.W. being 94. miles, and its breadth 5\u00a3 miles. The middle of the island, in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, presents a uniform level surface about 280 feet above the mean height of the sea, its northern shore being from 100 to 150 feet higher. Jersey thus, as already described, slopes to the southward, and to this circumstance may probably be attributed the pre-eminence it enjoys in the richness of its productions, its luxuriance, and the peculiar mildness of its climate. Granite and syenitic rocks are the principal formations. The interior is well wooded, fertile, and intersected by deep and beautiful valleys running from South to North, through which numerous streams find their way to the 1owt land on the southern coast ; several occasionally uniting before discharging themselves into the sea. Jersey possesses several good bays or roadsteads besides its artificial harbours. The best anchorages are in Gorey roads on the eastern side of the island, and in St. Aubin bay on its south-eastern coast ; in either of these, a good and well found ship may ride out the heaviest gales from any quarter in safety. The principal artificial harbour, fully described at page 210, is at St. Helier, the chief town of the island, at the eastern side of St. Aubin bay. There are also smaller harbours at St. Aubin on the western side of the bay, at Gorey, at Rozel, and at other places, but they all dry at low water, springs. Jersey has its own legislature, the States, consisting of the Lieut.- Governor and the Bailiff of the Royal Court, appointed by the Crown ; twelve Jurats (Judges) of the Royal Court, elected for life by the rate-payers ; the Rectors of the twelve Parishes into which the island is divided, and the Constables of the same ; also a Deputy for each parish, St. Helier having three Deputies, elected in the same manner but for three years only. Appeals lie to the Queen in Council."], [222, "[Chap. V. 200 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. This island, like Guernsey and Alderney, is, for ecclesiastical pur poses, in the diocese of Winchester. Each parish has its own church, the spires of which serve as the principal landmarks. The old Norman French is the language chiefly spoken, but English is rapidly coming into use. The population of the island, according to the census of 1881, amounted to 52,445 ; of which number, about 28,000 form the population of St. Helier. A great part of the island is laid out in orchards, cider and apples being among its chief exports; Jersey cattle, as also granite, red gravel, china clay, vegetables, and fruit are exported, and early potatoes are raised in large quantities for the London market. The chief imports are grain, flour, and cattle from France ; and, timber from Sweden, Norway, and North America. Ship-building was formerly carried on with great success, and Jersey produced some very fine and fast vessels of from 500 to 1,200 tons burthen, but since 1870 this trade has been in a state of decay. In that year, 446 vessels and one steam-tug belonged to the island, measuring 48,812 tons in the aggregate and employing 4,014 seamen ; sixty of these vessels, manned by about 600 seamen, were employed in, or connected with, the Newfoundland cod fishery. Telegraph cables. \u2014 The telegraph cable connecting Jersey with Guernsey, and thus with England, is landed a little eastward of Grosnez point. That connecting Jersey with France is laid from Fliquet bay to Pirou ; see pages 168, 249. PILOTS. \u2014 The following is extracted from the Law on Pilotage issued by the States of the island of Jersey in January 1857, and still in force : \u2014 \" The master of every vessel bound to this island, and arrived one mile West of the Corbiere rock, shall lay his vessel to, as soon as a pilot is in sight, and take a pilot on board as soon as one presents himself, on pain of paying such pilot the highest rate of pilotage. \" Fishing boats and vessels admeasuring forty tons and less shall not be liable to take a pilot, but all other vessels employed in the coasting trade shall be liable to do so, paying half the pilotage dues when it has been ascertained that they are employed in the coasting trade only, unless it be otherwise provided by the tariff. \" When the weather is so stormy as to prevent a pilot from boarding a vessel at sea, the master of such vessel and the pilot shall so steer that the pilot boat may take the lead and serve as a guide, and such vessel shall be liable to the same pilotage dues as if the pilot had boarded her."], [223, "Chap, v.] GOVERNMENT. \u2014 PILOTS. \u2014 ASPECT. 201 \"Any pilot passing a vessel coming to the island shall be liable to a penalty of five pounds sterling, unless such vessel have already a pilot on board, or the weather is so stormy as to prevent the pilot boarding her. \" Every pilot shall have a flag striped horizontally red and white, 6 feet long and 4 wide, which, on boarding a vessel and taking charge, he shall direct the master thereof to hoist at the peak as a signal that a pilot is on board, under the penalty of five pounds sterling against the master refusing to do so. \" Any pilot undertaking to pilot a vessel shall, when required so to do, exhibit to the master or mate of such vessel his warrant, together with this law and tariff annexed thereto, under the penalty of thirty shillings.\" ASPECT OF JERSEY.*\u2014 The first objects distinguishable on approaching Jersey from the westward are, the churches of St. Peter and St. Ouen, St. Ouen windmill with St. Peter's barracks, an extensive range of buildings on the sandy heights, and now and then the turret of St. Mary's church, together with Prince's tower or Hougue Bie, appear among the trees in the interior of the island. St. Peter and St. Ouen churches stand high : the spire of the former is lofty, the latter has only a tower. On a nearer view, the lighthouse on the Corbiere rock and then Rocco fort and towTer and the four martello towers on the sandy beach in St. Ouen bay present themselves, as also the tower on l'Etac point and the remark able rock, known as the Pinnacle, between that point and Grosnez point ; and finally, the declining land to the south-eastward, with its well-wooded surface and its shore of sand and rock. Jersey is encompassed by dangers rendered doubly formidable by the great rise and fall, as well as by the rapidity, of the tides. On the north-western and western sides are the Bane Desormes, Rigdon bank, and the shoals surrounding the Corbiere rock ; but the most remarkable are, the Pierres de Lecq or Pater-Nosters, the Drouilles, and the Ecrehos, on the northern and north-eastern sides ; the Violet bank surrounding the south-eastern angle ; and, the Minquiers ledge, from 7 to 10 miles distant, with many other rocks, fronting the whole of its southern shores. PLATEAU DES MINQUIERS.\u2014 For the description of this tangled mass of reefs, see Chap. IV., page 129. * See Views on Admiralty chart, Jersey, No. 62 c."], [224, "202 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. [Chap. V. The descriptions of the other reefs and shores of the island com mencing on the N.W., with the Bane Desormes, follow successively the western, southern, eastern, and northern coasts. Bane Desormes, 3^ miles N. \\ W. from Grosnez point, and the same distance from the highest of the Pierres de Lecq rocks, is a bank of rocky ground one mile long N.N.W. and S.S.E. and a third of a mile wide ; the depths are generally from 12 to 15 fathoms, except near its extremes, where are two conical masses of rock, that on the northern end having 23 feet water, and that on the southern end 1\\ fathoms. The latter bears from the former S.S.E. distant three quarters of a mile. On the 23-feet rock, which is small and pointed, with from 9 to 12 fathoms close around, the white house on La Moye is only just shut in behind the outer part of Pinnacle point S. \\ W. ; and, the south western high rock of the Pierres de Lecq shut in with Belle Hougue point, nearly to the outer part of its high bluff, bears S.E. La Moye white house on with Rocco tower, South a little easterly, leads westward ; Tour de Rozel just shut in with Belle Hougue point S.E. \\ E. leads southward ; and, the Corbiere rock just in sight outside the Pinnacle S. by W. \\ W. leads eastward of the Bane Desormes. Grosnez point is the high precipitous bluff at the north western extreme of the island ; from it, St. Martin's point, Guernsey, the nearest point of that island, bears N.N.W. \\ W. westerly 14\u00a3 miles. On the summit of the point are the ruins of an old fort. From Grosnez point, the land trends eastward towards Plemont point and the northern side of Jersey, and southward towards St. Ouen bay ; in this direction, the coast continues high and rugged nearly as far as l'Etac point, southward of which the high land recedes from the shore. ST. OUEN BAY forms the western coast of Jersey between l'Etac point and the Corbiere. As already described, its shores are low and sandy, but quickly rising to the level of the plateau of the interior. Southward of St. Peter's barracks, standing conspicuously on the high land, is the Quenvais, an extensive district covered with sand and forming a remarkable feature on this coast, Anchorage.\u2014 St. Ouen bay affords good shelter in easterly winds, but no vessel should anchor in it with the wind from the westward. The greater part of the bay being rocky and foul, the anchorage is limited to a space about half a mile square near the southern part, between the Great bank and Rocco tower ; here a vessel is well"], [225, "Chap, v.] 203 ST. OUEN BAY. sheltered from the tide, and may lie in about 7 fathoms, sandy bottom, with St. Ouen mill a little open northward of the square fort on the beach, between Nos. 2 and 3 towers, bearing E. by N. \u00a3 N. northerly. The anchorage is easy of access and may be safely entered by large vessels without pilots. An extensive reef, dry at low water, stretches off 7 cables westward of the Rocco tower, and from thence extends alongshore southward in the direction of the Corbiere rock, which it unites with Corbiere point; the whole of this reef is covered before high water except a small rocky mass near the middle. Between the Rocco tower and l'Etac, there is a fine beach of white sand, but, at low water, it is fringed with rocks throughout, and off l'Etac point it dries out for three quarters of a mile ; the greater part covers before half flood and no part is visible at high water. Rigdon Bank, of which the outer edge is nearly 2 miles west ward of l'Etac point, consists of ridges of rocks, the interstices being filled up with sand and gravel ; it is about a mile long, E.N.E. and W.S.W., and 2 cables wide. The general depth is from 3 to 5 fathoms but two rocks have only 11 feet over them ; of these, one is near the middle, the other at the north-eastern extreme. The bank is very steep-to on the outside, and between it and the Etac reef is the Swash way channel, about a third of a mile wide, with a general depth of 6 fathoms ; this channel is frequently used by vessels of from 200 to 300 tons. Plemont and Grosnez points in line E. \u00a3 S. lead northward of Rigdon bank. La Moye white house midway between Flat and Sharp rocks S.S.E. southerly, or St. Peter's spire open southward of No. 2 martello tower S.E. \u00a3 E., leads south-westward ; and, St. Peter's spire open eastward of No. 1 martello tower S.E. \u00a3 S. leads north eastward of it, The best leading mark through the Swrashway between Rigdon bank and the Etac reef is, the highest heads of the Pierres de Lecq or Paternoster rocks about half a point open of Grosnez bluff N.E. by E. \u00a3E. West rock, called by some of the fishermen Grey bank, is li miles westward of Rigdon bank ; it is a mass of rock, very steep on the outside, 1^ cables long N.E. and S.W., and more than a cable wide, on which are from 7 to 10 fathoms except near the middle where there are only 6 fathoms. From this spot, St. Peter's spire a little open northward of the small square fort on the beach bears S.E. by E. -}\u2022 E. easterly ; and, the highest of the Pierres de Lecq is open 8\u00b0 of"], [226, "204 [Chap. V. CHANNEL ISLANDS \u2014 JERSEY. Grosnez bluff, which bluff and the Corbiere rock subtend an angle of 72\u00b0. The shoal part is well marked near low water by a strong ripple. The channel between West rock and Rigdon bank is more than a mile wide, quite clear, and has from 12 to 17 fathoms water. Great bank extends N.N.W. \\ W. 1^ miles from the Corbiere rock, and is 3 cables wide. It consists entirely of sand and has from 7 to 9 fathoms except at two spots where are narrow ridges of fine sand with as little as 5 or h\\ fathoms. The outer ridge is at the northern extreme of the bank, close to deep water, and is about 2 cables long E.S.E. and W.N.W. ; its centre bears N.N.W. \\ W. westerly \\\\ miles from Corbiere lighthouse. The inner ridge is similar to the outer, but only about half the length ; its centre bears N.W. \u00a3 N. 9 cables from Corbiere lighthouse. Between the ridges, there is a good channel in to the anchorage, rather more than half a mile wide, with regular soundings of from 8 to 9 fathoms, sand. St. Ouen mill a third of the distance between No. 2 tower and the small square fort southward of it, on the beach, bearing E. by N., touches the northern extreme of the Great bank. The Jument, a whitewashed rock Z\\ cables eastward of the Corbiere, touching the inner side of the Corbiere S.E. 4. S. leads westward ; and, the Jument on with the high-water rock midway between Corbiere rock and point, S.S.E., leads eastward. St. Ouen mill a little open northward of the square fort E. by N. \u00a3 N. northerly leads over the bank, midway between the two shoal ridges, in 9 fathoms water. Corbiere point, at the south-western end of Jersey, is a small low bluff with a flagstaff on the summit and two small houses at its side. Just within the point the land rises at a steep slope and unites with the high table land of La Moye. CORBIERE ROCK, a quarter of a mile westward of the point and connected with it by a reef which dries after the last quarter ebb, is 70 feet above high water and very remarkable. It stands prominently out from the coast line, is the principal landmark for vessels approaching from the westward, is a signal station, and is in telegraphic communication with St. Helier's ; it may be seen in clear weather 10 or 12 miles distant. On it stands a circular stone light house, 62 feet in height from base to vane ; from it, the Minquiers light-vessel bears S.S.W. \\ W. 174. miles, this line crossing the Brisants-du-Nord-Ouest of that shoal ; and, the Hanois lighthouse N.N.W. \\ W. westerly 23\u00a3 miles."], [227, "Chap, v.] CORBIERE ROCK AND LIGHT. 205 LIGHT. \u2014 Corbiere rock lighthouse exhibits at 119 feet above high water a /Lced white light round seaward between the bearings S. by E. easterly and N. by W. westerly. In-shore of the limits of the ivhite light, two sectors of red light are shown, one north-eastward over the Rigdon bank and from thence to the land ; the other, south eastward over the Vracheres and the adjacent dangers between them and the shore. The light is dioptric, of the second order, and in clear weather the ivhite light is visible 17 miles. Fog Signal, \u2014 During fogs a bell is sounded three times in quick succession at intervals of thirty seconds. Caution. \u2014 Mariners must be very careful when navigating within the limits of either sector of red light. The principal dangers off and near the Corbiere are the Green rock, the Boiteaux, Boue, Frouquie, and Noirmontaise rocks. Green rock, the outermost danger, has 11 feet water ; it bears N.W. hy W. \u00a3 w. 6\u00a3 cables from the Corbiere lighthouse and 2 cables from the Boiteaux rocks on the same line of bearing. The marks for it are, St. Ouen mill just eastward of No. 3 martello tower N.E. by E. \\ E. ; and, the Jument rock on with La Moye Point S.E. \u00a3 E. Another rock, with only 8 feet water, lies E.N.E. one cable from the Green rock. The Boiteaux are two rocks only 60 yards apart between the Green rock and the Corbiere ; they uncover 9 feet distant 4\u00a3 cables from the Corbiere. From the southern Boiteaux, St. Ouen church is open southward of No. 4 martello tower N.E. by E. \\ E. ; and, the white house on La Moye is on with the northern side of the peak of the Corbiere rock S.E. by E. \\ E. easterly. The Boue rock bears N.W. northerly 3\u00a7 cables from Corbiere lighthouse and uncovers 20 feet, or rather before half ebb ; it is at the inner part of the sunken reef in-shore of the Boiteaux. The Frouquie is at the outer edge of the reef extending from Rocco tower and fort to the Corbiere, from which latter it bears N. \\ W. 5 cables ; and, from the Boue rock N.E. easterly 3 cables. The Frouquie covers 6 feet at high water, springs. Noirmontaise reef lies a quarter of a mile westward of the Corbiere, and dries 4 feet at low water. Another reef, one cable westward of the Corbiere, has 4 feet only over its shoalest part ; and, a large rock S. by E. one cable from the Corbiere, uncovers after the first quarter ebb. Clearing marks. \u2014 St. Ouen windmill open northward of No. 3"], [228, "206 [Chap. V. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. martello tower leads outside and northward of the Green rock and of other rocks north-westward of the Corbiere ; and, La Moye white house on with the Jument rock leads 3 cables southward of the Green rock and half a cable southward of the Noirmontaise reef. The Frouquie Pass is between the Frouquie and Boue rocks. The clearing marks for the outer and inner parts of the Great bank, see page 204, are the best leading marks by which to enter this pass from the northward ; for, should both the Boue and Frouquie rocks be covered, a vessel cannot go too near the former so long as the Jument is in sight inside the Corbiere, nor can the Frouquie be touched without opening the Jument eastward of the high rock between Corbiere point and rock. There is a small rock 1^ cables westward of the Frouquie with only one foot water ; from it, the Jument rock and a beacon pole on the western side of the high rock between Corbiere point and rock are in line. With this exception, there is a clear 2j-fathoms passage more than a cable wide ; no vessel should, however, attempt to run through until half tide, that is to say, until the Boue rock is nearly awash ; it is then quite safe for vessels under 15 feet draught. At about this time, therefore, enter the pass midway between the Frouquie and Boue rocks, with the Jument midway between the Corbiere rock and the large rock off Corbiere point ; and, when St. Ouen church tower is on with the high rocky mass south-westward of Rocco tower N.E. \u00a3 E., steer for the Corbiere rock until within one cable of it, when it must be rounded at the distance of three quarters of a cable only ; and, run out to the southward when the Pinnacle rock is nearly on with the outer part of the Corbiere. There is a narrow deep water channel between the Green rock and the Boiteaux ; also, a narrow channel between the Noirmontaise and Boue rocks, close to the Corbiere and leading to the Frouquie pass, but the space between the Boiteaux and Boue rocks, and from the latter to within one cable of the Corbiere, is so thickly studded with sunken rocks as to be very dangerous even for boats, at low* water, and should be avoided. Jument rock, very useful as a sea-mark, has a large white patch painted on it ; from it, Corbiere lighthouse bears N.W. 3^ cables ; and, it is one cable from the high bluff next eastward of Corbiere point, with which bluff it is connected by a reef dry at low water. Half a cable outside the Jument is a dangerous rock which dries only at the last quarter ebb ; it should not be approached therefore nearer than a quarter of a mile."], [229, "Chap, v.] FROUQUIE PASS. \u2014 ST. BRELADE BAY. 207 LA MOYE POINT is a high cliffy bluff one mile eastward of the Corbiere ; on the high land behind the point is a conspicuous white house, very useful as a sea-mark ; it was used as a look-out house in connection with the signal post formerly existing on these heights but now superseded by the signal station established at the Corbiere lighthouse. The quarries at La Moye, showing at a distance as a white mark in the bluff are also useful in clearing the Minquiers reefs. La Moye point is safe of approach from the westward, but 1\u00a3 cables off it there is a rock with only 6 feet water ; close eastward of this rock and probably connected with it are the Kaines, a dangerous rocky group of which the highest covers only at the last quarter flood. The outer sunken rock of the Kaines lies 2% cables from the shore. Corbiere lighthouse kept open southward of the Jument until Tabor chapel, in St. Brelade bay, opens out eastward of Grosse Tete, leads clear of all these dangers. r ST. BRELADE BAY, near the south-western end of Jersey, between La Moye and Le Fret points, is much contracted by the ex tensive reef fringing its eastern shore, and the anchorage is further cut up by the Fournier and Fourche rocks. There is always less sea on the western than on the eastern side of the bay, but it is very inferior to St. Aubin bay as an anchorage and more exposed to southerly gales ; nevertheless, small vessels, and even large open boats, anchored within it off port Bouilly, have been known to ride out safely fresh gales from this the most exposed quarter. Approaching St. Brelade bay from the westward, the most remark able objects seen are, Grosse Tete, the high square rock under the rugged land of La Moye on the western side of the bay ; and, Noirmont tower standing prominently out at the end of the low point of that name to the eastward. On opening out the eastern side of the bay clear of Grosse Tete, the white sandy beach appears, and two martello towers, one on each side of Grouin point at the head of the bay ; beyond are villa residences and scattered groups of houses ; whilst, above all, on the high land near the middle of the bay, stands Tabor chapel, a plain white building with slate roof forming the principal landmark in it. Near the middle of the bay are the Fournier and Fourche rocks, about 2^ cables W.N.W. and E.S.E. from each other. The best anchorage is about a cable north-eastward of the Fournier ; the ground is quite clean up to the base of this rock, which is of very small extent. The Fournier dries 9 feet and the Fourche 10 feet at low water, springs."], [230, "[Chap. V 208 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. The other but less important rocks of the bay are, the Fournier du Havre, which dries 17 feet 2f cables north-eastward of the Fournier ; the Platte Houmet, which dries 12 feet in the bight nearer the shore ; and, the Rousse rock, 60 feet high, with the Rousse- Frouquie just northward of it, on the eastern side and outer part of the bay. St. Brelade bank is an uneven bed of rocks, commencing half a mile South of La Moye point and extending eastward nearly three quarters of a mile ; the least water, 29 feet, is near the middle of the bank. Le Fret bank, 3 cables off Le Fret point, is 3^ cables in extent N.W. and S.E. and of an oval form. Several rocks on its eastern side have from 22 to 24 feet on them, and one on the western side has only 14 feet ; the marks for it are, Nicolle and Noirmont towers in line E. by S. ; and, the western martello tower in St. Brelade bay on with the Rousse-Frouquie N.N.E. | E. At 2 cables eastward of Le Fret bank and in the direction of Noirmont tower, there is another rocky bank on which the least water is 20 feet.

Directions. \u2014 A vessel from the north-westward bound to St. Brelade or St. Aubin bay, on nearing the shore of Jersey, should keep Plemont point open of Grosnez point until Corbiere lighthouse bears eastward of S. by E. in order to clear the Rigdon shoal. When St. Peter's spire opens southward of No. 2 martello tower she will be southward of the shoal, and from thence should steer to round the Corbiere about a mile distant, avoiding the Green rock and other off-lying reefs by keeping St. Ouen windmill open northward of No. 3 martello tower in St. Ouen bay until the white house on La Moye is on with the Corbiere lighthouse. When La Moye white house opens southward of the Jument rock E. by S. S., or when the outer part of the high table land within Noirmont point is open of Le Fret point, a vessel is clear of the Noirmontaise reef and of all dangers south-westward of the Corbiere, and may run for La Moye point until Motte islet, off point le Croc, is just shut in behind Noirmont point, and Noirmont tower bears S.E. by E. h E., which mark leads between the Kaines off La Moye point and St. Brelade bank, until Tabor chapel is on with, or a little open of,"], [231, "Chap. V.] ST. BRELADE, PORTELET, AND ST. AUBIN BAYS. 209 Battery point N.E. \u00a3 E., which then becomes the leading mark through the western pass to the inner anchorage off St. Brelade. Tabor chapel kept bearing N.E. \\ N. leads up to the inner anchorage eastward of the Fournier rock. Anchor within the Fournier rock in from 4 to 5 fathoms, fine sand, on or between either of these lines, when La Moye bluff comes on with the outer part of Grosse Tete W. by N. \u00a3 N. Large vessels may anchor outside the Fournier in 8^ fathoms, gravel, with the western pass leading mark on, and the Jument rock just shut in with La Moye point. The holding ground in this bay is remarkably good. PORTELET BAY, between Le Fret and Noirmont point, is a bad anchorage ; it is small, and still further contracted by rocks extending westward from Noirmont point, as well as from the centre of the bay westward of Janvrin tower, which, together with the rapidity of the tidal stream across the entrance, render it dangerous of approach even for vessels of the smallest size. The danger is increased by Portelet ledge, an isolated mass of rock S.W. by S. 2\\ cables from Janvrin tower ; from the shoalest spot of 2 feet on this ledge, the white house on La Moye over a remarkable sharp-peaked rock semi-detached from Le Fret point bears N.W. \\ W. ; and, Noirmont tower appears northward of the high part of Pierre au Poisson, which lies midway between that tower and the ledge. Noirmont tower southward of the Pierre au Poisson leads just southward of Portelet ledge. If compelled to anchor in Portelet bay, the best berth is in 4^ fathoms, sand, with La Moye point just shut in with Le Fret point, and Janvrin tower N.E. In case of necessity, a vessel may anchor outside and eastward of Portelet ledge in 6 fathoms, with Corbiere lighthouse nearly on with La Moye point N.W. \\ W. ; Janvrin tower N. by E ,\\ E. ; and, Elizabeth castle just open southward of Noirmont tower E. \\ N. ST. AUBIN BAY.\u2014 The whole of the anchorage in this fine bay, though surrounded by rocks, is free from foul ground and sheltered from all winds but those from S.S.E. round by South to W.N.W., and partially so even from them. South-westerly gales send in a heavy rolling sea between half flood and high water, but as the water falls the sea subsides, the rocks in the offing greatly contributing to break its force. The town and harbour of St. Helier occupy the north-eastern side of the bay, and the little town of St. Aubin, with its castle on a A. 2771. Wt. 17197. 0"], [232, "[Chap.

Both towns have stone pier harbours, where vessels lie aground at low water on a soft muddy sand ; the tide, at low water, springs, receding half a mile from St Aubin harbour, and half a cable outside the entrance, of St. Helier new harbour. A strong mole or breakwater projects from the northern side of St. Aubin castle, sheltering a pier within, where vessels frequently refit and unload, grounding, how ever, at low water. Elizabeth castle is built on a craggy rock on the eastern side of the bay fronting the harbours of St. Helier, and about three quarters of a mile south-westward of the town ; the top of its high central tower or keep being 144 feet above the low water level. On the site of this castle formerly stood an Augustine monastery built in honour of St. Helier, a recluse, whose hermitage, on the summit of a high rock, \\\\ cables southward of the castle, still exists. Elizabeth and St. Aubin castles are insulated every tide, and afford shelter respectively to the two harbours, by breaking the swell wrhich rolls into St. Aubin bay during south-westerly gales. ST. AUBIN HARBOUR.\u2014 Several rocks lie scattered south ward and westward of St. Aubin castle, most of which uncover at low water. The two largest and most conspicuous are the Grosse and the Platte, very close together and 1\u00a3 cables from the castle ; the Grosse is the highest and shows about the first quarter ebb ; both rocks are marked by beacon poles. Another group of rocks lies 2 cables southward of the Grosse, the north -easternmost head drying 7 feet at low water. Haule house open eastward of St. Aubin castle breakwater leads eastward of these rocks ; and, eastward of this line, the bottom is all fine sand. At half flood, there are 8 feet water inside St. Aubin castle pier, at which time the water begins to flow into the entrance of St. Aubin harbour. The passage westward of St. Aubin castle is not passable for boats until half flood. The population of the little town of St. Aubin is about 1000. There is direct communication between it and St. Helier by railway. The chief import is coal and the only export red gravel. No stock of coal is kept on hand for shipping, the port of St. Helier being so near at hand. About 46 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 3700 tons enter the port annually. Water of first rate quality may be procured from pumps on the quay at St. Aubin harbour. ST. HELIER, the chief town of Jersey is built on low land open southward but overlooked and sheltered northward by a"], [233, "Chap, v.] 211 ST. AUBIN AND ST. HELIER HARBOURS. semicircular elevated plateau completely commanding it. The town is well built, and, as previously stated, contains about 28,000 in habitants, more than half the population of the island. It has a college and several churches, whose spires, together with Fort Regent on the eastern side of the town, are the most prominent objects from the sea. There is no Sailor's Home, but a large general hospital is available in case of accident or illness. The English quarantine laws are in force, and vessels from the Mediterranean or from infected ports are not permitted to enter the port until pratique has been granted by the Custom's authorities. In 1886, the total arrivals at St. Helier were 2139, and their net tonnage 316,616 tons. Steamers run between Jersey and South ampton, London, Plymouth, Bristol, and other English ports ; and, to Granville, St. Malo, St. Brieuc, and de Carteret, in France. St. Helier has a well-supplied market, where fresh meat and poultry may be purchased at about the same prices as in London. Fish is scarce, vegetables and fruit abundant and cheap. St. Helier Harbours5 are on the north-eastern side of St. Aubin bay. The old harbour is completely enclosed by the new harbour constructed between the years 1840-50 at a cost of 170,000^., from designs by Mr J. Walker, C.E. Both are alike in form, the new harbour being in fact a repetition of the old on an extended scale ; except that the form of the entrance to the new harbour is inferior to that of the old, permitting the south-westerly swell to range freely into it in heavy gales, to the great injury of vessels compelled to remain there at such times. The harbours are nearly rectangular, narrow in proportion to their length, with the entrances near their south-western corners. The old harbour is about 1,900 feet long by 300 feet wide ; it dries 11 feet at the entrance and 25 feet at its northern end, and has 8 feet water at its entrance at half tide. The outer harbour, enclosed by the Victoria and Albert piers, is 2,600 feet long by 500 feet wide ; it dries 3 feet between the pier-heads and 17 feet at its northern end ; it has 16 feet in its entrance at half tide, the ground rising gradually within the pier-heads for a distance of about 300 feet where there are 13 feet at that time ; the bottom is fine sand and mud through out. A new landing stage is in course of erection within the Victoria pier-head and dredging to the depth of 7 feet is intended * The works commenced in 1872 to enclose the two present harbours and suspended since 1878, were resumed in 1887 so far as the Elizabeth castle breakwater is concerned, for the protection of the Little road and of existing works. 02"], [234, "212 [Chap.

Should this prove successful, it is proposed to continue dredging until this landing stage is accessible at all times of tide. Coal can always be obtained, though the stock on hand is usually not large, from 300 to 400 tons, and the price from 18s. to 22s. per ton ; it is placed on board vessels alongside the quays where the available depth at high water, neaps, is about 18 feet ; but, it must be borne in mind that all the berths are dry at low water. There is a graving slip 155 feet long and a floating dry dock 140 feet long capable of accommodating vessels of 500 tons ; large wet and dry docks are projected in present plans for harbour improvements, 1887. There are ample facilities for all ordinary repairs to machinery and to shipping generally, and a steam-tug is always available. Good water may be obtained from pumps on the inner quay of the old harbour. A Life-Boat is stationed at St. Helier. LIGHTS. \u2014 The following fixed lights are exhibited for the guid ance of vessels bound for St. Helier. A white light, from the lighthouse on the Victoria or South pier head of the new harbour, 31 feet above high water, and visible 6 miles. A red gas light on the Albert or North pier, just within the pier head, 15 feet above high water, and visible 3 miles. A small white light, an ordinary ship's riding light, from the end of the Elizabeth breakwater as the works progress. A green gas light on the western angle of the Albert pier, and a red light at its inner end on the esplanade parapet wall N.E. \\ N. 630 yards from the green light, and both visible 3 miles. The two latter lights in line lead through the middle of the Little road, between the Oyster and Dog's Nest rocks, and between the Cloches rocks, clear of all danger. The same mark leads between the Hinguette rock and Grune St. Michel, when the lights can be seen at that distance, care being taken to open them a little one way or the other to clear a rock in the fairway having only 7 feet water, and lying 2\\ cables south-westward of the high head of the Hinguette.

For a full description of the tidal streams off St. Helier harbour and in St. Aubin bay, see pages 265-267.* The Dog's Nest Rock, an important mark either for entering St. Aubin bay or St. Helier from the westward, is near the outer extreme of the rocky ridge extending from point de Pas, which forms the eastern boundary of St. Helier Little road. It is nearly awash at high water, and its apex is marked by three white spots and is surmounted by a beacon consisting of an iron pole and ball. The principal rocks fronting the harbour and around the Little road of St. Helier, besides the Hermitage and Dog's Nest rocks, always above water, are, the Cloches rocks, the Oyster rocks, Grune Moulet, the Platte, and the Sharp rock. The Cloches are two sunken rocks immediately off the entrance to the Little road. The western Cloche has 8 feet water and is on the western side of the fairway, with Nicolle tower a little open south ward of the Dog's Nest beacon pole E. S. ; and, the Oyster rock beacon pole on with the north-eastern extreme of Elizabeth castle N.N.E. E. ; another rock with 8 feet water lies N.N.W. 1\\ cables, and a third with 7 feet, N.E. by N. 1\\ cables from the western Cloche ; from this last rock, Elizabeth castle flagstaff is on with the Oyster rock beacon, distant from the latter exactly one cable. A chain of sunken rocks connects this last rock with the Oyster rock group, but there are 3 fathoms with clean ground close outside or southward of it. The eastern Cloche rock is on the eastern side of the fairway and has only 2 feet water ; from it, the western Cloche bears W.N.W. 1^ cables. There are 4 fathoms between it and the rocks which extend from the direction of the Dog's Nest to within two thirds of a cable of this rock. Oyster Rocks and Grune Moulet occupy positions on either side of the entrance to the Little road. They bear S.E. \u00a3 E. and N.W. \u00a3 W. 2h cables from each other, and are each marked by a swinging beacon consisting of a pole surmounted by a ball.

The Oyster rock beacon pole is marked in 23 divisions of a foot each. When the rocks are awash, there are 10 feet water between the Victoria and Albert piers ; and, after the rocks are covered, the depth of water in feet between the piers may always be known by deduct ing the number of divisions seen above water from 33. The Grune Moulet dries 11 feet ; its beacon pole is marked in 10 divisions of 2 feet each. Platte Rock is within the entrance to the Little road E. \u00a3 N. northerly exactly one cable from the Oyster rock beacon. It dries one foot, and, from it, the S.E. rock off the Hermitage is just open of the eastern side of Elizabeth castle. There is no safe channel between the Oyster and Platte rocks. Sharp Rock dries 3 feet S.E. by E. \\ E. 1\u00a3 cables from the Platte. The channel into the Little road lies between the Platte and Sharp rocks, and has 22 feet water at the lowest equinoctial spring tides. In passing between these rocks, which is the narrowest part of the channel, the Platte may be cleared on its eastern side by keeping the spire of St. Mark's church open eastward of the northern white patch on the Albert pier ; and, Sharp rock may be cleared on its western side by keeping the eastern end of Almorah teri*ace open westward of the Albert pier. Anchorage. \u2014 Little Road lies eastward of the Hermitage rocks, and is frequented chiefly by vessels waiting tide to enter the harbour, or during neaps in fine weather with off-shore winds. The entrance to it is between the Oyster and Platte rocks on the port hand, and the Grune Moulet and Sharp rocks on the starboard hand ; the depth is from 17 to 6 feet, at low water, springs, but the anchorage is so contracted by rocks that vessels over 8 feet draught, if remaining beyond a tide, should moor. At low water, the Little road is com pletely sheltered eastward by a rocky barrier entirely dry, extending from point de Pas to the Dog's Nest rock, and westward by a chain of sunken rocks extending from the Hermitage to the Oyster rocks and one cable beyond the Oyster rock beacon, as well as by the works of the Elizabeth breakwater now in progress which are rapidly closing all access to the Little road on this side.

The available anchorage space is only 1^ cables wide N.W. and S.E. and nearly a quarter of a mile long N.E. and S.W. and is surrounded by dangerous rocks ; see also directions, page 225. DANGERS Off ST. AUBIN BAY.\u2014 The principal dangers to be avoided in approaching St. Aubin bay, in addition to the St. Brelade and Le Fret banks, described at page 208, are, the Vrachere, the Hubaut with its surrounding rocks, the Grunes, the Grunes Vaudin, the Sillette rocks, the Fours, the Grunes aux Dardes, and Danger rock, on the western side ; the Rouaudiere near the middle ; and, the Grunes St. Michel, the Hinguette, Tetards, and Demie de Pas, on the eastern side ; the Diamond rock near the centre of the bay, in line between the Noirmont tower and the outer Hermitage rocks ; the Pignonet, Grunes du Port, and Junees along the western shore ; the Baleine and other sunken rocks near the eastern shore off Elizabeth castle ; and, the Cloches, already described, off the entrance to St. Helier Little road. Some of the passages between these rocks are extremely narrow, and all are dangerous both from the rapidity of the tides and from the generally discoloured state of the sea preventing the rocks being seen, even when close to them. A stranger should not attempt to navigate these channels without a competent pilot. The Vracheres, a rocky bank of small extent, is the outer or south-western danger off St. Aubin bay. The Frouquie, its highest head with only 5 feet water, is at the eastern extreme of the bank, with Prince's tower touching the western corner of Fort Regent E. by N. 4. N. ; and, the western martello tower in St. Brelade bay on with the western head of Rousse-Frouquie N.N.E. 4 E. The Vraicquieres, Hubaut, Grande and Petite Grune, and Passage Rocks, all lie between the Vracheres and point Le Fret ; the narrow channels separating these rocky banks should never be attempted. The Vraicquieres, North A\\ cables from the shoalest head of the Vracheres, has 17 feet, least water.

The Petite Grune has 10 feet on its shoalest part, from which St. Mark's spire just shut in with Noirmont point bears E. \u00a3 N. northerly ; and, the western martello tower in St. Brelade bay mid way between Rousse rock and Le Fret point N. by E. 4_ E. The passage between the Petite Grune and Le Fret bank is 2\\ cables wide. The Passage rock of 14 feet bears W.N.W. 5 cables from the shoalest spot on the Petite Grune, and, from it, the Dog's Nest rock beacon is on with the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette ; this is also a leading mark for the western channel, but leads, as described, over the Passage rock and very close inside all these dangers. Their eastern boundary is marked by Tabor chapel on with the high-water extreme of Le Fret point. Grunes Vaudin are an extensive cluster of rocks more than a mile S.S.W. of Noirmont point and a mile eastward of the Vracheres. The two highest rocks, the Grand Vaudin and the S.W. rock, dry 5 feet near the middle of the bank, about N.E. \\ E. and S.W. \\ W. 2 cables from each other ; from the S.W. rock, the gateway of St. Brelade church is just in sight eastward of the Rousse rock N. \\ W.; and, St. Mark's spire is a little open eastward of the south-eastern part of Elizabeth castle N.E. by E. \\ E. easterly. From the S.W. rock a chain of dangerous sunken rocks extends 2\\ cables W.N.W., and also 5 cables in a north-easterly direction ; the eastern part, called the Poches-a-suie, is nearly detached from the Vaudin bank, and has on it as little as 4 feet.

From the southern rock, which has 2 feet water, Lower Blanc Pignon house just shut in with the detached eastern bastion of St. Aubin castle bears N. | E. ; and, Fort Regent signal post over and shut in with the north-eastern extreme of Elizabeth castle, East a little southerly. Baleine Rock with 2 feet water, the most important danger within the bay on its eastern side, is between Gros du Chateau and the Diamond rock.

ANCHORAGE.\u2014 There is sufficient room for several vessels to lie at single anchor in St. Aubin bay ; but, if moored, the hawse should be open to the South-west from September to March when the prevailing winds are from that quarter. The best berth is within the Diamond rock, with St. Saviour's church tower just open northward of St. Mark's spire and on with the high rock between Gros du Chateau and the Vrachere E. by N. N. ; or, Fort Regent signal-post, seen over Elizabeth castle, on with Gros du Chateau E. \\ N. ; and, Haule house on with the northern extreme of St. Aubin castle breakwater N. by W. \u00a3 W., in 20 feet at the lowest spring tides. This spot is N.N.E. nearly 2 cables from the Diamond rock. Vessels wishing to lie as near as possible to St. Helier, may anchor outside the Diamond rock in 5 fathoms, with Haule house on the same bearing, and with St. Mark's spire touching the south-eastern Hermitage rock N.E. by E. This last position should only be used in fine or moderate weather, but at the anchorage within the Diamond rock, vessels of 18 feet draught may ride out a heavy southerly gale in safety, being out of the strength of .the tidal stream and the swell and sea being broken by the outlying rocks, especially when the water is below the level of half tide. During neap tides, vessels of 22 feet draught may safely anchor inside the Diamond rock, but, for deeper vessels, there is no safe anchorage on any part of the southern coast of Jersey in very bad weather. PASSAGES into ST. AUBIN BAY.\u2014 Nine passages lead into St. Aubin bay, viz. ; the North-west, Western, South-west, Sillette, Danger rock, Middle, Hinguette, South, and Eastern. In westerly gales, the best time to pass through any of these channels is between first quarter flood and high water. The first of the ebb throws up a very dangerous overfall off Noirmont point, and when the westerly tide has fairly made, overfalls which continue with more or less intensity according to the height of the ocean swell and strength of the wind, extend across all the channels until the ebb'tide slacks. NORTH-WEST PASSAGE is only 1\u00a3 cables wide at the narrowest part between point Le Fret and the rocky bank of that"], [243, "Chap, v.] 221 ST. AUBIN BAY. \u2014 PASSAGES INTO. name, which, however, at its shallowest spot has 14 feet water ; the channel is safe and has nothing less than 7 fathoms in any part. It being the steam-packet route between Southampton, Guernsey, and St. Helier, is indeed more used than any of the other channels. Directions. \u2014 Having rounded the Corbiere, see page 208, and having passed between La Moye point and St. Brelade bank by shutting in Motte islet with Noirmont point and having Noirmont tower bearing S.E. by E. | E., run direct for the tower until Corbiere lighthouse is on with La Moye point N.W. \\ W. which mark leads midway through the narrowest part of the channel off Le Fret point in 8 fathoms. Continue on the same line until the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette is on with the Dog's Nest rock beacon E. by S. ; this mark leads nearly midway between Noirmont point and the Four reefs off it, more than one cable inside the Rouaudiere rock, exactly midway between the Cloches and the 7-feet rock a cable outside the Oyster rock beacon, and up to the leading mark for entering the Little road ; see pages 214 and 225. WESTERN PASSAGE, between the Hubaut reefs and St. Brelade bank, is rather more than a quarter of a mile wide at its narrowest part, between the Petite Grune and le Fret bank where there are from 7 to 9 fathoms water, but the Passage rock with only 14 feet lies in the fairway of the entrance. It is, however, the most direct route to St. Aubin bay and St. Helier harbour from the westward, one leading mark only being required, but as the marks are not easily made out in hazy weather, the North-west passage is probably the best and safest. Directions. \u2014 The leading mark is, the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette and the Dog's Nest beacon in line E. by S. ; this almost touches the northern side of the Passage rock, and passes only half a cable northward of the Petite Grune, therefore in entering the channel from the westward, to clear those reefs, keep the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette well open northward of the Dog's Nest beacon until Tabor chapel is on with Le Fret point, after which they may be brought in line, and, as already described, lead up to the entrance of the Little road. Should the white patch at Greve d'Azette be obscured, De Pas tower on with Noirmont tower W. \\ N. northerly will do equally well, but, to clear the 20-feet rock eastward of Le Fret bank, the Her mitage rock should be opened clear of Noirmont point before shutting in Tabor chapel with Le Fret point ; and, if all objects eastward and"], [244, "[Chap. V. 222 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. near the town are invisible whilst the land about Noirmont and La Moye are tolerably clear, which is often the case in very fine weather, Noirmont point may be approached to the distance of a cable ; but, in passing eastward of it, do not shut in the white house at La Moye with Le Fret point until St. Aubin castle opens out ; this clears the dangerous rock between, and outside the line of, Noirmont tower and Pignonet beacon. After passing Pignonet beacon, bring Noirmont tower a little open northward of it, and, when about a quarter of a mile eastward of the beacon, anchor until the weather clears. SOUTH-WEST PASSAGE is between the Vracheres and the Grunes Vaudin, eastward of the Grande Grune, and westward of the Grand Four. The narrowest part of the channel is between the 6-feet sunken rock at the northern part of the Grand Four, and another rock with 20 feet over it ; these rocks bear from each other W. by N. \\ N. and E. by S. \\ S. and are 2 cables apart. Directions. \u2014 Admiral Saumarez's house, a yellow building named The Firs about half way up the slope of the hill north-eastward of St. Matthew's church, on with Noirmont tower N.E. \\ E. leads mid way between the Frouquie of the Vrachere and the Grunes Vaudin ; enter the channel therefore on this line and run on it until the white patch in the sea wall at Greve d'Azette is on with the Dog's Nest beacon E. by S. when proceed as before directed. As the leading mark given leads very close past the western side of the Grand Four, it is recommended that on the flood vessels should run in on it only until Tabor chapel is on with the upper part of the slope of Le Fret bluff, and then use that as the leading mark until the eastern leading mark comes on as before. Tabor chapel is here given as the most conspicuous mark, but this leading line approaches the Grande Grune rather nearer than is desirable ; for the middle of the channel, Tabor chapel should be shut in altogether, and the Pic-nic hotel, a house with a white gable on the low land westward of the chapel, should be brought in line with the extreme of point Le Fret. As there are overfalls and strong eddies from the rocks in this channel on both ebb and flood, it should be avoided except in fine weather. SILLETTE PASSAGE is between the Sillette rocks and the Grunes aux Dardes, the channel between them being less than 2"], [245, "Chap. V.] 223 ST. AUBIN BAY \u2014 PASSAGES INTO. cables wide, with an average depth of 6 fathoms ; but, a rocky patch of 26 feet lies in the fairway, so that no more than this depth can be depended on. Directions. \u2014 The Sillette passage should only be attempted by a sailing vessel with a fresh leading wind, as both tidal streams set right across it. The leading mark is, the western martello tower, white, in St. Aubin bay on with the eastern side of Grosse rock, on which there is a beacon, N by E. \u00a3 E. This leads 1\\ cables eastward of the Poches-a- Suie rocks on which there are only 4 feet water, midway between the Sillette and Grunes aux Dardes, one cable eastward of the Petit Four, llj cables eastward of the Pignonet beacon, half a cable westward of the Grunes du Port, and very close inside the western head of the Junees. MIDDLE PASSAGE is between Danger rock and the Grunes aux Dardes on the western side, and the Tetards, Hinguette reef, and Grunes St. Michel on the eastern side. The narrowest part of the passage would be more than half a mile wide but for two sunken rocks, with only 14 and 15 feet over them, southward of the Grunes St. Michel and distant from it nearly half a mile, thus dividing the channel into two. The westernmost of these two rocks has 15 feet water, and is near the middle of the channel at its entrance ; it bears from Danger rock E.S.E. 44, cables. The best channel is between Danger rock and this 15-f eet rock ; here the ground is clean and the soundings regular in about 7 fathoms ; the eastern side of the Middle passage is rocky and the depths irregular. Directions. \u2014 Mont Plaisir house touching the western side of St. Aubin castle tower North a little westerly, leads through the Middle passage, passing 1^ cables westward of the 15-feet rock, 24 cables east ward of Danger rock, and rather less from the Frouquie of the Grune aux Dardes on which there are 5 feet water, 1\u00a3 cables westward of the Rouaudiere buoy, 1^ cables eastward of the Grunes du Port, and outside but very close to the Junees sunken rocks. To anchor in St. Aubin bay, haul to the eastward when the eastern end of Almorah terrace comes on with the Vrachere, marked by a beacon, and the innermost high rock northward of Elizabeth castle, to clear the Diamond rock ; and, anchor as convenient wmen Haule house is open eastward of St. Aubin castle tower. DANGER ROCK PASSAGE is between the Grunes aux Dardes and Danger rock and is at this part 3 cables wide with bk"], [246, "224 [Chap. V, CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. fathoms water near the middle, but two rocky patches of 16 and 17 feet lie close south-eastward of the leading line. This passage, like the Sillette, is dangerous at times for sailing vessels, and should not be taken without a pilot. Steam-vessels, however, whose captains are acquainted with the pilotage, use it as the most direct passage to the Little road from the south-westward. Directions. \u2014 Bring St. Mark's spire on with the south-eastern rock off the Hermitage N.E. by E. ; this mark leads nearly 1^- cables southward of the southernmost rock of the Grunes aux Dardes, awash at low water, and rather farther from the Danger rock ; it also passes more than 14_ cables clear of the outer 7-feet rock of the Rouaudiere, and close eastward of an 8-feet rock off the Oyster rocks ; between this 8-feet rock and the Bieuse rock, marked by a beacon pole, and as far eastward as the Oyster rocks, the ground is quite clear of rocks. HINGUETTE PASSAGE, between the Hinguette reef and the Tetards, is 34. cables wide, has 7 or 8 fathoms water, and is a good and safe passage at slack watei, but at other times requires careful allowance for the tide, which sets right across it, Directions. \u2014 Enter this passage with St. Mark's spire on with the Dog's Nest beacon N.E. 4, N. and run through between the Hinguette reef and the Tetards. After passing inside the Hinguette, St. Matthew's church comes on with the Gros du Chateau rock, North, which mark leads between the Cloches rocks up to the entrance of the Little road. SOUTH PASSAGE is between the Tetards, with only 2 feet water, and some rocky patches to the eastward on which the shoalest spot has 14 feet. The channel is 2 cables wide, has 8 fathoms water, but is not so safe as the Hinguette or as the Eastern passage. Directions.\u2014 St. Matthew's church tower, a dull greyish-white building, seen between the heads of the Gros du Chateau rock, North, leads through about mid-channel, and between the Cloches up to the entrance of St. Helier Little road ; but, if proceeding to the anchorage in St. Aubin bay, when St. Peter's spire is on with Lower Blanc Pignon N. by W. 4. w. steer with it as the leading mark up to the anchorage. Near low water, St. Peter's spire may be lost sight of before arriving at the anchorage, in which case care must be taken to note some other object in the line of direction."], [247, "Chap, v.] ST. HELIER LITTLE ROAD.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. 225 EASTERN PASSAGE.\u2014 The narrowest part of this passage is between Demie de Pas, which dries 20 feet and on which is a beacon pole, and a rock with 11 feet water. The latter rock bears W.N.W. 3 cables from Demie de Pas beacon, and, from it, the 9-feet rock, see page 218, bears N. by W. \u00a3 W. one cable. The ground outside Demie de Pas is clean up to the foot of the rock, which is not more than 40 yards from the beacon. Directions. \u2014 The new mill on the beach at Millbrook, just in sight or opening of the high rocks on the western side of the Hermitage N. \u00a3 W. leads 1\u00a3 cables westward of Demie de Pas, and three quarters of a cable eastward of the 11 and 9-feet rocks just described. A vessel may therefore run in on this line until the white patch in Greve d'Azette bay is on with Tas de Pois white rock, after which she should edge to the N.W. to bring the leading mark for the South pas sage in line, St. Matthew's church on with Gros du Chateau rock ; this leads up to the entrance of the Little road ; or, St. Peter's spire on with Lower Blanc Pignon leads up to the anchorage in St. Aubin bay. ST. HELIER LITTLE ROAD.\u2014 DIRECTIONS.\u2014 When bound from St. Aubin bay into the Little road it is best to weigh at about half flood, at which time there are 16 feet water between the flier-heads of the new harbour, and 8 feet between the pier-heads of the old harbour ; at high water, highest springs, there are 36 feet at the entrance of the new harbour, and 27 feet between the pier-heads of the old harbour. Proceeding from the anchorage in St. Aubin bay, or from the west ward, into the Little road, it must be borne in mind that the channel inside or northward of the Oyster rock is now, 1888, practically closed by the works of the Elizabeth breakwater in progress. Vessels must therefore always keep southward of the Oyster rock, as follows : \u2014 From St. Aubin bay, or from the Westward, the channel is between the western Cloche rock with 8 feet water and the outer Oyster rock with 7 feet ; it is 14^ cables wide and has from 4-^ to 5 fathoms water. Steer between the Oyster and Cloches rocks, with the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette ami the Dog's Nest beacon in line, until St. Mark's spire is on with the white patch at the Albert pier-head N.E. \u00a3 E., which mark leads into the Little road ; but, after passing the.Platte rock, edge to the northward until St. Mark's spire is on with the northern white patch A, 2771.

From the Southward.\u2014 Pass between the Cloches rocks with St. Mark's spire on with Victoria pier lighthouse N.E. % E. ; and,when inside the Oyster rocks, proceed by the marks just given for the Little road or for the harbour entrance, as may be required. From St. Aubin Eay over the Bridge* to the Little road or St. Helier harbour. This passage is only fit for small craft at high water ; in taking it, steer to pass half a cable northward of the Vrachere rock, on which is a small beacon pole, or run in with St. Mark's spire on with the northern side of the hospital until De Pas tower opens northward of the northern white patch on the Albert pier, with which mark run over the Bridge (this part has only one foot water at half tide), and either enter the harbour or haul out into the Little road. By night. \u2014 Bring the Victoria pier white light to bear N.E., and steer for it until the green light and inner fed light on Albert pier are in line bearing N.E. \\ N. ; which mark, if visible so far, leads between the Hinguette rock and Grunes St. Michel up to the anchorage in the Little road, or to the entrance of the harbour, care being taken to observe the precautions named at page 214. CAUTION. \u2014 In entering the harbour, allowance must be made for the tide, which, at or near springs, runs in and out with consider able strength. The most dangerous time for a vessel to enter is at about half flood ; at that time, vessels are frequently forced over against the sand-bank fronting the South pier of the old harbour before they have time to turn their heads up the harbour. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 In beating along the southern coast of Jersey, it should always be borne in mind that the available space between the outer shoals off Noirmont point and the Minquiers ledge is but 8 miles, and between the Violet bank and the Minquiers only 6| miles. Small vessels working up towards the narrows of the western channels, when eastward of the Kaines, may stand into St. Brelade bay until the Jument rock is on with La Moye point ; and southward, until the southern extreme of Elizabeth castle is on with Noirmont point, East, When in the narrows of the western channel, before half flood or after half ebb, backing and filling is recom- * This passage may become closed as the works, recommenced at the Elizabeth breakwater, proceed ; see note, page 211."], [249, "Chap. V.] ST. AUBIN BAY. \u2014 GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 227 mended with a beating wind ; if with the flood, the vessel's head should be off-shore, and, if with the ebb, in-shore. Between half flood and high water, a vessel may act according to her draught, for, at half tide, there are at least 13 feet over all the rocks in the offing of St. Aubin bay, with the exception of the Pignonet, Hinguette, and Sillette, on which there are then only 9, 8, and 7 feet respec tively. If bound to the Little road or to St. Helier harbour, it may be useful to know that St. Mark's spire touching the southern side of Close rock leads 60 yards northward of the Rouaudiere ; and, the same spire on with the False Hermitage leads well southward of it. A vessel from the north-westward running for shelter in St. Aubin bay during a gale from that quarter, should keep \\\\ miles outside the Corbiere to avoid the breaking sea near it, especially between half ebb and lowr -water ; and, when the land of Noirmont is well open, steer for its point until Grosnez point comes on with the Corbiere, when haul up for La Moye and bring the marks for the North-west passage on, see page 221, where much less sea will be found than in either of the others. In heavy westerly gales, the whole space between the outlying rocks off Noirmont point is a confused mass of breakers ; clouds of driving spray create an impenetrable mist, obscuring all marks near the level of the sea, and the beacons marking rocks are all out of sight ; but, even under such circumstances, the North-west passage may be safely taken by those acquainted with it, as both Le Fret and Noirmont points are safe of approach for large vessels to the distance of one cable. On arriving abreast of Noirmont point, attend to the directions given at page 222 ; or, do not shut in La Moye white house with Le Fret point until the white martello tower in St. Aubin bay opens eastward of St. Aubin castle to clear the Pignonet rocks, as the first of the flood sets right over these rocks into St. Aubin bay. It may be useful to repeat that when Haule house comes on with the western end of the wall extending westward from St. Aubin castle the vessel is midway between the Grunes du Port and the Diamond rock : and, that St. Saviour's church tower just open northward of St. Mark's spire and on with the high rock between Gros du Chateau and the Vrachere rock beacon E. by N. J N. leads up to the anchorage in St. Aubin bay, well clear of the Diamond rock. Approaching from the w estward, the Frouquie rock, off Le Croc point, on with Seymour tower E. by S. leads outside all the shoals P 2"], [250, "[Chap. V. 228 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. off Noirmont point and St. Aubin bay until near the Tetards, when the tower should be brought nearly on with the Rousse rock, just northward of the Icho tower. From the eastward, the white house on La Moye on with Le Fret bluff N.W. 4. W. westerly leads outside all the rocks off St. Clement's bay, and of the Frouquie and Demie de Pas, up to the leading mark for the Eastern passage. The COAST eastward of St. Helier is low and sandy to La Roque point, the south-eastern extreme of Jersey, distant 54/ miles E. by S. \u00a3 S. from Noirmont point, and also northward of La Roque point as far as Mont Orgueil bluff, which bears from La Roque point N.N.E. \u00a3 E. 2 miles, the bight between them being named Grouville bay, off which, at one mile S.E. 4, E. from Mont Orgueil castle, is good anchorage for vessels of the largest size. The southern part of this coast is inaccessible to shipping, it being fringed by extensive reefs which dry in some parts around La Roque point 2 miles from the shore at low water, springs. The outer edge of these reefs on the southern side is generally steep to and, fortunately, well marked by a number of large rocks, which, although sometimes nearly awash at high water, are never entirely covered. Two stone towers, each about 45 feet above the high-water level, also mark these reefs \u2014 viz., the Icho tower, about 3 miles south eastward of the Little road of St. Helier ; and, Seymour tower, off La Roque point, 1\u00a3 miles farther eastward and near the middle of the Violet bank. VIOLET BANK is the general name applied to the south-eastern part of the great reefs eastward of St. Helier. It extends rather more than 2 miles from La Roque point, and consists of gravel, shingle, and sand, interspersed with numerous ledges of sharp-pointed rocks, the whole bank drying at low w*ater, springs. The greater part of the bank covers at half flood, at which time there is a foot of water over the inner part of the ridge of sand and shingle extending from La Roque point to Seymour tower ; this, the lowest part of the ridge, is near La Roque point and is the most favourable spot for the passage of boats. At high water, the bank is entirely covered and is then only marked by the Conchiere rock at its southern extreme, by Seymour tower near the middle, by Karame rock, at this time awash, on the South-east, and by Little Seymour rock, also awash but marked by a pole and basket beacon, near its eastern side. From half flood to half ebb, the stream runs with a velocity of 6 knots, at springs, over the Violet bank and through the Violet"], [251, "Chap. V.] VIOLET BANK. \u2014 ICHO AND SEYMOUR TOWERS. 229 channel in a1 north-easterly direction, turning northward through Gorey roads where its strength is about 44, knots. As before remarked, the reef eastward of St. Helier, as well as the southern edge of the Violet bank, is well marked by conspicuous rocks, which, together with the principal sunken dangers along this line, will now be described. Tas de Pois, or White rock, bears S. by E. \u00a3 E. 7 cables from the Dog's Nest beacon, see page 213. Although only 5 feet above high water, springs, it is very remarkable from its upper part being well whitewashed all round, and from there being another rock, rather larger and black, 1^ cables eastward of it. Dangerous rocks, which never show, extend If cables westward of it ; and, a quarter of a mile north-westward is a rocky group, of which the Trois Grunes, the highest heads, uncover 20 feet, A chain of rather high rocks extends from the White rock to the shore. The Frouquie, S.E. \u00a3 S. 74, cables from White rock, is 3 feet lower than the White rock, and therefore nearly awash at high water, springs. A chain of high rocks extends from the Frouquie to point Le Croc, of which the inner and highest is Motte islet, which is about 22 feet above the level of the highest tides. This line of rocks marks the limit of the Greve d'Azette, the first bay eastward of St. Helier. The coast between Motte islet and La Roque point recedes slightly and forms St. Clement's bay. A dangerous reef extends W.S.W. 2\\ cables from the Frouquie. Demie de Pas, the westernmost rock of a cluster bearing W.N.W. half a mile from the Frouquie and S. \\ W. 4 cables from the White rock, dries 20 feet, is steep-to outside, and is marked by a pole beacon. La Moye white house on with Le Fret point N.W. \\ W. westerly leads \\\\ cables outside all the rocks off Demie de Pas and the Frouquie. Between the Frouquie and Icho tower, no rocks are visible at high water to mark the outer edge of the reef, but, at half tide and less, it is well marked by the Rouget rock, which is close to the edge of deep water and bears S.E. \\ S. 6^ cables from the Frouquie ; also, by the Jinquet which dries 25 feet half a mile E.S.E. from Rouget rock; and, 3 cables eastward of the Jinquet rock is the Grande Frouquie, which bears W. by S. \u00a3 S. 3 cables from the Icho tower and is 7 or 8 feet above the level of the highest tides. ICHO and SEYMOUR TOWERS bear from each other East and West and are 1| miles apart. Icho tower is surrounded by high"], [252, "[Chap. V. 230 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. rocks, and in this respect differs from Seymour tower,_which at high water rises abruptly from the sea and is completely isolated. Echiquelez Rock is one of the principal sea-marks near Icho tower, from which it bears S. by E. 4| cables. Its summit is 5 feet above the highest tides ; it is steep-to on the outside westward, but S.S.E. i E. li cables from it is a half -tide rock ; and, north-westward, in line between it and the Jinquet, are several dangerous rocks, of which the farthest dries 5 feet at low water and lies 1^ cables S.S.W. from the Grande Frouquie. Between Echiquelez rock and the Conchiere, the edge of the reef curves outwards nearly a quarter of a mile beyond a straight line connecting those rocks. Icho Bank is a dangerous, rocky, irregular ridge about 4^ cables long in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, and 1^ cables wide ; the least water, 2^ fathoms, is at the northern extreme, and bears S.W. \\ W. 2\\ miles from the Icho tower ; from this shoal spot, La Platte Roque martello tower just open northward of Icho tower bears N.E. \\ E. ; and, St. Peter's spire open eastward of Lower Blanc Pignon house N. by W. \\ W. westerly. On other parts of the bank there are from 3 to 5 fathoms water. The channel between this bank and the rocks fronting Icho tower is nearly 2 miles wide and clear of danger. The Conchiere Rock, 2 miles from La Roque point at the southern extreme of the Violet bank, dries 41 feet, and is therefore never covered, although sometimes awash. From it, Mont Orgueil castle and Seymour tower are exactly in line N. \u00a3 E., the latter distant \\\\ miles. A reef extends \\\\ cables southward from the Conchiere ; therefore that rock should not be approached nearer than a quarter of a mile. A good clearing mark for the line of reef just described between the Frouquie and Conchiere rocks is, Corbiere rock lighthouse touching La Moye point until the Grande Anquette beacon is well open southward of the Conchiere rock. VIOLET CHANNEL.\u2014 A sunken reef, commencing at the Conchiere rock, extends eastward 1^ miles on the bearing of the Echiquelez and Conchiere rocks in line. Northward of this line for rather more than a mile, the entire space is shoal water with rocks innumerable ; so that, at low water, it is difficult for a stranger to find his way through them even in a boat. From the Conchiere"], [253, "Chap, v.] VIOLET CHANNEL. \u2014 DANGERS. 231 eastward, the southern edge of this reef is well marked at the last quarter ebb by a long string of rocks called the Route en Ville ; its eastern extreme is bounded by the Petit Four, a rock with 2 feet water ; and, the reef may be said to extend northward as far as the Cochon, Noire, and Grande Haisse rocks. The navigable part of the Violet channel is between this sunken part of the Violet bank and the Plateau de la Frouquie, the rocky bank to the southward on which are the Goubiniere and Rousse Platte rocks, and the Anquette rocks to the eastward. The narrowest part is between the Petit Four and the sunken rocks westward and north-westward of the Petite Anquette, where it is about half a mile wide ; the general depth is from 5 to 6 fathoms. Anquette Channel leads out eastward between the Grande and Petite Anquette rocks from the middle of the Violet channel. The general depth of water is from 6 to 7 fathoms, rather deeper than in the Violet channel, but, from the absence of good leading marks, the passage is more difficult, Near the point of separation of the Anquette and Violet channels, with Prince's tower and Little Seymour beacon in line, and with the Grand Anquette beacon turret bearing E. S., is a rock with 23 feet water and another near it with 25 feet, Though nothing less than these depths has been found, caution is necessary with large ships passing this part of the channel at low water. Vessels of about 15 feet draught should wait until the flood tide has fairly made, and, w-ith any swell on, should not pass through until the first quarter flood. DANGERS in VIOLET CHANNEL.\u2014 The Conchiere rock, see preceding page, is the principal mark at the western entrance of the Violet channel. Taxe Rock, 6\u00a3 cables eastward of the Conchiere, dries 10 feet at low water ; from it, the Conchiere and Echiquelez rocks are exactly in line bearing N.W. by W. \\ W. Route en Ville Rocks. \u2014 A quarter of a mile south-eastward of Taxe rock, with Echiquelez rock open southward of the Conchiere, is the highest rock of the Route en Ville, which dries 11 feet ; West rock dries 6 feet half a cable W. f S. from it ; and, another rock, a cable eastward of the highest head, dries 10 feet. From these rocks eastward, and close to deep water, the Route en Ville chain extends for about half a mile with an outward curve ; most of the rocks are nearly awash at low water. St. Martin's spire on with Gorey tower"], [254, "[Chap. V. 232 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY, leads over a 2-feet rock half a cable within or westward of their eastern end. To clear these rocks on their southern side keep Icho tower open southward of the Conchiere rock until Prince's tower is on with Seymour tower ; after which, keep Echiquelez rock open southward of the Conchiere until Prince's tower is on with No. 5 martello tower in Grouville bay. Petit Four, with 2 feet water, is at the eastern extreme of the Violet bank ; from it, Karame rock just shut in with the outer part of the high table land above Noirmont point bears N.W. by W. 4 W.; the sentry-box of Coupe guard-house, a stone turret on the summit of Coupe bluff, seen over the end of the bluff just within the break water house at Verclut point N. \\ W. westerly ; and, Grande Anquette beacon turret on with the northern side of Petite Anquette rock S.E. by E. I E. On the southern side of the Violet channel the following are the principal rocks : \u2014 PLATEAU DE LA FROUQUIE.\u2014 The Goubiniere dries 20 feet at low water ; it is at the western end of the Plateau de la Frouquie, very little eastward of Orgueil castle, Seymour tower, and Conchiere rock in line, and distant from the latter nearly 1^ miles. From the rock, La Moye white house over the outer part of Le Fret point bears N.W. \\ W. There are several rocks northward of the Goubiniere ; the Canger rock is the most northern, it dries 16 feet, and is one cable distant from the Goubiniere. Orgueil castle open westward of Seymour tower and of the Con chiere rock clears the Goubiniere and all dangers on the western side of the Plateau de la Frouquie. Frouquier Aubert Rock, formerly marked by a beacon turret, which, however, has been washed away (1883), is at the south-western edge of the Plateau de la Frouquie, 1\u00a3 miles south-eastward of the Goubiniere ; it uncovers 26 feet at low water and does not cover at neaps. From it, St. Peter's spire is on with the white patch on South hill ; and, St. Martin's spire is a good sail's breadth open eastward of Seymour tower N. \\ W. westerly. Rousse Platte Rock is at the eastern side of the Plateau de la Frouquie, and E. \u00a3 S. rather more than a mile from the Goubiniere ; it is a large flat rock about half a cable in diameter and dries 14 feet."], [255, "Chap. V.] PLATEAU DE LA FROUQUIE.\u2014 ANQUETTE ROCKS. 233 Between this rock and the Goubiniere are several rocks, of which one dries 15 feet, another dries only 4 feet but is the most dangerous, as it stands prominently out towards the channel. Pierre des EnfantS, 2\\ cables S. by E. 4 E. from the Rousse Platte, is 7 feet higher than that rock, and is therefore a very useful mark when the Rousse Platte is covered by the tide. ANQUETTE ROCKS.\u2014 Petite Anquette lies 2h miles E. by S. \u00a3 S. from the Conchiere rock, and, with the Seal rocks and Maraine reef, forms the eastern boundary of the Violet channel. The Petite Anquette uncovers 20 feet ; from it, Bergerie house on the heights above Noirmont point, on with the northern side of Motte islet bears N.W. by W. \\ W. ; and, Archirondel red tower in St. Catherine's bay its apparent breadth open eastward of Rozel manor-house, N. by W. \u00a3 W. Seal Rocks form part of the extensive reef northward of the Petite Anquette, on which one of the most dangerous ridges is known as the Seals. The western Seal dries 4 feet N.N.W. \\ W. 3\u00a3 cables from the Petite Anquette. A rock with only 12 feet water lies If cables westward of the western Seal ; and, the Maraine reef, with as little as 3 feet water, lies N.N.E. more than 6 cables from the Petite Anquette. All these rocks are probably connected with the Petite Anquette. Grune Le Feuvre has only 6 feet water at its shoalest spot, which bears N.E. \u00a3 N. 1^ miles from the Petite Anquette. Grande Anquette Rock lies E. by S. \\ S. 3^ miles from the Conchiere rock and S. E. \u00a3 E. 3^ miles from Seymour tower ; the rock covers about 8 feet above half tide, but it is marked by a stone beacon turret painted in horizontal bands of red and white, 20 feet above high water, and surmounted by a staff and ball. From the beacon, Petite Anquette rock bears N.W. by W. \u00a3 W. three quarters of a mile ; Rousse Platte rock W. \u00a3 S. southerly 2\\ miles ; Grande Arconie, which dries 9 feet, S.S.E. \\ E. easterly one mile ; and, Porpoise rock, which dries 4 feet, S.W. by W. westerly 8i cables. Anquette Patches form a small rocky bank, with from 16 to 20 feet on its eastern end, N.E. \\ N. one mile from the Grande Anquette ; from the eastern shoalest spot of 16 feet, Seymour tower on with the"], [256, "234 [Chap.

Another bank of rock and gravel lies E. by S. \u00a3 S. 2 miles from the Grande Anquette, and N.W. 4, N. Z\\ miles from the B\u0153uf beacon turret; from its shoalest part of 15 feet, Rozel mill a little open eastward of St. Catherine's martello tower bears N.W. by N. ; and, Grande Anquette beacon turret and the Conchiere rock in line W. by N. \\ N. PLATEAU DE L'ARCONIE \u2014 Some dangerous sunken rocks with as little as 3 feet lie a quarter of a mile E.S.E. from the Anquette beacon turret ; and, the space southward of it for the distance of \\\\ miles is occupied by a vast shoal called by the French the Plateau de l'Arconie ; some of the rocks on this shoal begin to uncover soon after the last quarter ebb, at springs ; others are only awash at low water, springs, and by far the greater part never uncover at all. Grande Arconie Rock, which dries 9 feet, is at the eastern side of the plateau ; the Porpoise rock, drying 4 feet, marks its western boundary ; the Grand Four rock, drying 7 feet, and with several small rocks drying 2 feet in its vicinity, lies just within its south western extreme ; and, Grune la Hauche dries 6 feet one mile S.E. by E. \\ E. from the Grand Four, and 1\\ cables S. by W. \u00a3 W. from the Grande Arconie. The channel between Plateau de la Frouquie and Plateau de l'Arconie is \\\\ miles wide and has 5| fathoms water, but its free navigation is impeded by a string of rocks extending across at unequal distances from each other between the Pierre des Enfants and the Grand Four ; some are awash, others have 5 or 6 feet over them at low water, springs. The great strength of the stream at this part of the channel and the absence of good marks render its navigation extremely perilous near low water ; no vessel should attempt to pass through, therefore, until after the first quarter flood. Coupe guard-house a little open eastward of the breakwater house at Verclut point N. \u00a3 W., the same mark as for the northern entrance * Staff Captain J. S. Watts, R.N., reported in July 1886 that the arms of Rozel mill had been removed, thus rendering it difficult of recognition as a mark.

Anquette Gravel Banks or Southern Anquettes commence near the the south-western extreme of the Plateau de l'Arconie, and extend 5 miles south-eastward in an almost continuous line. They consist of a number of narrow ridges of fine gravel. having generally a depth of from 3 to 4 fathoms, except on one detached bank near the south-eastern end, where there are only 2 fathoms. The marks for this spot are, the white house at La Moye just northward of Frouquier Aubert N.W. \u00a3 W. westerly ; Grande Anquette beacon turret a little within Verclut point N. by W. \u00a3 W. ; B\u0153uf beacon turret E.N.E. northerly 3 miles ; and, Basse le Marie bell buoy S.S.E. 34, miles. There are good 7-fathoms channels on either side of this bank. La Moye white house on with Le Fret point N.W. \u00a3 W. westerly leads south-westward of the southern Anquettes, of the Plateau de la Frouquie, and of all the rocks bordering the southern shore of Jersey, up to the leading mark for the Eastern passage into St. Aubin bay ; and, this line passes 1J miles northward of the Icho bank. Directions. \u2014 Violet Channel. \u2014 If bonnd eastward from St. Helier through the Violet channel, having cleared the dangers outside the Little road, keep the Corbiere lighthouse just in sight open of La Moye point N.W. \\ W. until Orgueil castle, seen over the low* land of La Roque point, comes on with Icho tower ; at which position, about half a mile from the outer edge of the reef, the Grande Anquette beacon turret will be a little open southward of the Conchiere rock E. by S. \\ S. From hence, steer S.E. by E. \u00a3 E., parallel with the outer edge of the reef, the depth being from 5 to 7 fathoms. The Conchiere rock should be passed atabout 4 cables, and, when eastward of it, bringtheEchiquelez rock on with Noirmont tower N.W. \u00a3 W. for a leading mark until Prince's tower is on with Seymour tower ; if the distance from the Conchiere and Route en Ville rocks has been correctly preserved in passing them, the Rousse Platte should now bear about S.W. 34 cables, and the Grande Anquette beacon turret E. \\ N. Now steer N.E. \\ N. to pass through the deepest part of the channel or, to pass through the middle of it, steer E. \\ N. for the Grande Anquette beacon until La Roque tower is on with Seymour tower, or until Coupe mound just open eastward of Verclut point bears N. \u00a3 W.,"], [258, "[Chap. V. 236 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. with which mark run towards the Petit Four; and, when northward of a line drawn from the Conchiere to the Grande Anquette, edge to the eastward to bring Coupe guard-house open of Verclut point N. \u00a3 W., which mark leads 2\u00a3 cables eastward of the Petit Four, one cable eastward of Giffard rock, and through Gorey outer road. For mid-channel through the latter, however, the vessel should again edge away to the westward when Gorey lighthouses are in line N.W. northerly, until Coupe mound is just open of Verclut point as before. The narrowest part of the Channel being between the Petit Four and Petite Anquette, it may be useful to know that the stone turret on the summit of Coupe point and the breakwater house at Verclut point exactly in line N. \u00a3 W. leads a cable outside the Petit Four ; at this position, Rozel mill touching the northern side of Mont Orgueil castle bears N. by W. 4, W. ; and, St. Catherine's white martello tower is on with Archirondel red tower. When abreast of the Petit Four, Earame rock just shut in with the high land above Noirmont point bears N.W. by W. 4/ W. ; and, the Grande Anquette beacon turret open northward of Petite Anquette S.E. by E. easterly. Small vessels may haul out eastward of the Chateau bank when Echiquelez rock is open northward of Karame rock, but vessels of very deep draught should not do so until Icho and Seymour towers are in line, in order to avoid the Stony banks 6 cables north-westward of Grune le Feuvre, on which there are only 25 feet at low water. GROUVILLE BAY, which derives its name from a hamlet near St. Clement's church, is on the eastern side of Jersey between La Roque point and Mont Orgueil. Its outer Southern boundary commences on the north-eastern side of the Violet bank and is very rocky ; numerous masses of rock lie scattered along the low- water line to the northward, which line is nearly a mile from the shore in the southern part of the bay; there are also many rocks within as well as outside this line. Grouville bay, at low water, is very picturesque with its vast expanse of fine white sand rising with a gentle slope towards the shore, bounded on the South by Seymour tower and the rugged rocks of the Violet bank, and on the North by Mont Orgueil and its venerable castle. The Horn Rock, N. W. by N. 74, cables from the Giffard rock and one mile southward of the Equerriere beacon, is the outer rock of the Frouquies de la Greve, dries 16 feet, and is marked by a staff and horizontal cross beacon."], [259, "Chap, v.] GROUVILLE BAY. \u2014 GOREY. 237 Amongst other rocks on the southern side of the bay is Little Seymour rock awash at high water and marked by a pole and basket beacon, from which a long string of rocks extends eastward forming the low-water boundary of the bay. Among the most important of these rocks are, the Cochon at the outer edge, which dries 7 feet ; the Grande Haisse, which dries 22 feet ; and, the Noire, which dries 14 feet, the latter nearly a mile outside Little Seymour beacon. Four cables outside the Noire, is the Giffard, a most dangerous rock in approaching Grouville bay from the southward ; 74, cables northward of it and in the centre of the bay is the Horn rock, just described ; and again, northward of the Horn rock is the Road rock of 9 feet water. The Giffard has only one foot over it at low water ; from it, Little Seymour beacon bears W. by S. h S. southerly nearly 1^ miles; the Horn rock beacon N.W. by N. 7.4,i cables ; and, a depth of 12 feet water on the South Ridge sand of the Bane du Chateau N.E, by E A E. 4 cables. From Giffard rock, Rozel mill a little open westward of Crete guard-house bears N.N.W. ; and, Little Seymour beacon open northward of Gros Etac rock W. by S S. Road Rock, 4 cables N. by W. from Horn rock beacon, and H cables outside the Grune du Port, has 9 feet water ; from it, St. Catherine's white martello tower just shut in with La Crete point bears N. by W.; and, No. 5 martello tower on with the extreme end of the high table land southward of Grouville mill W. \\ S. A 14-feet patch lies S.S.E. one cable from the Road rock. A small rock, with 26 feet water, lies 2i cables from Road rock in the direction of Verclut point ; half way between this and the Dasher rock, and about 1\u00a3 cables distant from each, is the Inner Road rock with 16 feet water. From this rock, St. Catherine's tower is just shut in with La Crete point N. by W.; and, Gorey pier lighthouse is open northward of the Ecureuil beacon, the latter being 2 cables distant. GOREY TOWN AND HAREOUR, at the northern end of Grouville bay, are immediately under Mont Orgueil castle. The little town contains about 1,000 inhabitants ; it is considered to be particularly salubrious and has railway communication with St. Helier, and by steamer with the coast of Normandy. It has a fair trade in vegetables, fruit, coal, cattle, timber, &c. Supplies of all kinds can be obtained, including coal in limited quantities, but vessels requiring coal, unless it can be shipped during tide time, 4 or 5 hours, have to lie aground in their berths. Hospital accommodation is available in case' of sickness or accident,"], [260, "238 [Chap, V. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. The harbour is formed by a stone pier built out from the south western part of Orgueil head. The accommodation for vessels is very limited ; the outer berth alongside the pier having a depth of only 9 feet at half tide, and, at low water, springs, the sand dries one cable outside the pier-head ; nevertheless, vessels of 300 tons may occasionally be seen here, and about 300 vessels of all sizes enter the port annually; as it is the' headquarters of the oyster fishery, a number of sloops of from 30 to 50 tons belong to the place. Two small warping buoys are moored at the entrance to assist vessels arriving or leaving, the outer buoy about a cable south -west ward of the pier-head, the other about 80 yards westward of the pier. About 135 yards westward from the pier-head is a space formerly paved with flat stones for depositing oysters and marked by a beacon ; this artificial oyster bed is, however, now (1887) much broken up and the beacon removed. With this exception, the bottom of Gorey harbour consisting of mud and sand, is good for grounding. Sharp vessels not provided with legs should always get a pier berth and list inwards, assisted by mast-head tackles to the shore, to prevent falling over at low water. During severe gales, a vessel strains less in taking the ground, is better sheltered, and experiences less 'scend in this harbour than in any other in the Channel islands. Mooring Buoy. \u2014 A mooring buoy is placed in 11 feet, with Gorey slip just open of the pier-head, and Horn rock and Ecureuil beacons in line, distant only one cable from the latter. The ground chain of these moorings lies North and South, there are 38 fathoms on each arm, and the anchors are of 24 and 30 cwt. A cable within the bouy there are 7 feet, and 3\u00a3 fathoms at the same distance outside, but close to their north-eastern side is a rock with only 7 feet at low water, equinoctial springs. LIGHTS. \u2014 From Gorey pier-head n fixed white light is exhibited at 35 feet above high water. On the slope of the hill in the face of the wall below Gorey church tower, at 535 yards N.W. \\ N. from the pier-head lighthouse, and 119 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed red light, visible 8 miles. The two lights in line lead northward of the Frouquies de Greve, and of the Road, Fisherman, and Azicot rocks, and southward of the Ecureuil rock; in passing which latter, the red light should on no account be opened northward of the white light,"], [261, "Chap, v.] GOREY. \u2014 DANGERS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 239 DANGERS. \u2014 The principal dangers in the immediate neighbour hood of the Port of Gorey are the following : \u2014 The Equerriere is the largest and most conspicuous rock off Gorey harbour ; it bears E. by S \\ S. southerly 4^ cables from the pier-head, dries 35 feet, and is marked by a pole and fish-tail beacon. Another rock, drying 14 feet, lies two thirds of a cable S.E. \u00a3 S. from it. Dasher Rock, with 2 feet water and from 18 to 20 feet close to, lies S. by W. \\ W. about one cable from the Equerriere rock. The Ecureuil, 14 cables S.W. of the Equerriere, dries 14 ifeet and is marked by a pole and basket beacon. Fisherman Rock, with 8 feet water, lies S. by W. 2 cables from the Dasher rock. Other rocks which abound here, though smaller, are very dangerous, such as the Azicot rock, 2 cables outside Gorey pier-head, which dries 5 feet and is marked by a spar buoy ; the Guillimots, a group of rocks S. by W. i_ W. 2\\ cables from the Azicot, of which group the outer rock dries 6 feet and is marked by a spar buoy ; the Burons, a rocky group 2 cables south-eastward from the Guillimots, of which the highest rock lies to the N.E. and is also marked by a spar buoy ; and, the Grune du Port, with 5 feet water 3| cables outside the Burons, on a line connecting Gorey pier-head and Horn rock beacon, but 3\u00a3 cables inside the latter. Directions. \u2014 To enter the Inner road or Gorey harbour, three channels are available according to the state of the tide. For the southern channel, the leading mark by day is the red lantern in the face of the wall below the church tower on with the pier-head N.W. \\ N., and, by night, the two lights in line. For the middle channel, the northern end of the white house at the top of Hardway on with the pier-head N.W. by W. \\, W. westerly leads between the Equerriere and Ecureuil rocks up to the mooring buoy in the Inner road. For the northern channel, the leading mark is, the chimneys of Fort William on with the pier-head bearing West southerly ; as this leads close past the Arches rocks, which dry 15 feet, it will be well to open the chimneys a little southward of the pier-head before the Equerriere and Ecureuil beacons are in line. If entering the harbour, having approached it by either of these channels, run up to the entrance, passing on either side of the Azicot"], [262, "240 [Chap. V. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. spar buoy, but leaving both the warping buoys near the pier-head on the port hand in rounding it, and be careful not to approach the pier too closely, as the tide sets round it to the eastward with great strength after half flood, at springs. When the Horn rock is awash, there are 10 feet water just off the end of Gorey pier and 5 feet at the outer berth alongside it. The Tres Grunes lie 2 cables outside and eastward of the Equerriere rock, and are awash at low water. Little Seymour beacon on with Seymour tower S.S.W. leads three quarters of a cable eastward, but passes over a 25-feet rock just outside them, which rock is the extreme end of the ledge, the water being deep close up to it, To clear this outer rock when passing the Tres Grunes in a large vessel, Little Seymour beacon should be kept perceptibly open west ward of Seymour tower. Northward about 1^ cables from the Tres Grunes is the Pacquet rock with 2 feet water ; within and north-westward of which, at about the same distance, are the Arches rocks, a small group which dry 15 feet, their south-eastern rock being marked by a spar buoy. Northward of these again, and within 3 or 4 cables of Mont Orgueil, are the Grand Houmet, Le Mont, Seven Grunes to be pre sently described, and many other rocks, the ground here being very foul. BANC du CHATEAU. \u2014 This extensive bank of sand, gravel, and shells, lies off Grouville bay nearly parallel with the low water line of the shore and distant from it rather more than a mile, except at its northern end which approaches Mont Orgueil within 1\\ cables ; it forms a great natural protection to the anchorage in Gorey roads. Within the 5-f a thorns line, the bank is rather more than 2 miles long by 4 cables w ide ; the main body has a general depth of 3 fathoms, gravel bottom ; from this base rise numerous narrow sandy ridges extending across the bank in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction. Near the middle, for about a mile, these ridges are so close together as to form almost one continuous bank, and have accordingly been named the Middle bank. At very low tides, this part occasionally dries. The North Ridge is nearly 4 cables within the northern end of the Chateau bank, and has from 10 to 12 feet water ; just south ward of it is a smaller ridge with only 5 feet, The South Ridge, with from 12 to 16 feet water, forms the south western and southern edge of the bank close to deep water,"], [263, "Chap, v.] BANC DU CHATEAU.\u2014 ANCHORAGE. 241 The Chateau bank is much affected by the weather and by the action of the tidal streams ; the upper part, within a particular and limited space, is continually shifting, and during westerly winds the ridges of the sand-banks are so sharp that, when awash, a boat may easily knock them down in passing over. At such times the banks are about 4 feet higher than with easterly winds. Clearing Marks. \u2014 Grouville mill on with the southern side of Mont Orgueil bluff W. by S. \u00a3 S. southerly clears the 5-fathoms line at the northern end of the bank. Icho tower and Little Seymour beacon in line W. by S. lead close past its southern end. Coupe guard-house turret on with the breakwater house under Verclut bluff N. \u00a3 W. clears the north-western corner and leads down its western side nearly in mid-channel ; and, Coupe guard-house turret on with St. Catherine's breakwater lighthouse N.N.W. \\ W. leads eastward of the bank as well as of a rocky 5-fathoms patch outside. Tongue Sands are two small shoal banks nearly 1 and 2 miles respectively eastward of the South ridge of the Chateau bank, but separated from it and from each other by good sound channels of deep water. They are of the same character as the Chateau bank, having sharp ridges of fine sand. The least water on the eastern bank is 36 feet, and on the western bank 23 feet. From the 23-f eet ridge, Coupe turret oj>en eastward of St. Catherine's lighthouse bears N.N.W. \\ W. ; and, Icho tower open northward of Little Seymour beacon W. by S. southerly. Anchorage. \u2014 Between the western side of the Chateau bank and the 5-fathoms line fronting Grouville bay is the Outer road, a safe anchorage and large enough to accommodate several vessels of deep draught, it being a mile long North and South by nearly half a mile wide. The eastern limit is marked by Coupe guard-house turret being on with the breakwater house .at Verclut bluff, and its western limit by St. Catherine and Archirondel towers in line. At its northern extreme, Gorey pier-head open southward of the Equer riere beacon bears W. by N A N. ; and, at its southern end, No. 4 martello tower and the Horn rock beacon are in line W. \u00a3 N. The space included within these lines has a depth of from 6 to 8 fathoms with an even bottom of gravel and shells, and the best line on which to anchor is Grouville spire on with Fort Henry. The Inner road is within the 5-fathoms line of Grouville bay, between the Road and Inner road rocks, and between the Equerriere beacon and the Burons rocks. In-shore of this space are the A. 2771.

Government moorings marked by a large buoy in 11 feet, but with a 7-feet rock close to on its north-eastern side, as already described. The best line on which to anchor in the Inner road is, with Prince's tower open northward of Fort William the apparent breadth of the latter. The anchorage in Gorey roads is the only place in the Channel islands, or on the French coast from St. Malo to Cherbourg, where a squadron of heavy ships might find good shelter in a westerly or north-westerly gale ; and, with proper charts and sailing directions, the approach is sufficiently easy for any seaman to take his ship in without the aid of a pilot, in clear weather. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Grouville Bay.\u2014 The approach to Grouville bay from the direction of the Violet channel has been already given, see page 235 ; when running for this bay from the northward, and having cleared the Pierres de Lecq, the Drouilles, and other dangers near the northern end of Jersey by the directions hereafter given, see pages 256-265, avoid the foul ground off Nez du Guet and Coupe point by giving each a berth of at least a quarter of a mile in rounding them ; Belle Hougue bluff open northward of Tour de Rozel point N.W. \\ W. leads outside the dangers off Coupe point and 6 cables northward of the Pillon rock off Verclut breakwater ; La Roque No. 1 martello tower on with the Equerriere beacon S.W. S., or Seymour tower and Little Seymour beacon in line, leads east ward of them but over the Fara ledge of 21 feet. The North Channel into Gorey road is between Fara ledge and the northern end of the Chateau bank, and is there only a quarter of a mile wide with a depth of 6 fathoms in mid-channel, but it has a depth of 4 fathoms for a width of 4 cables and is therefore perfectly safe for large ships. Entering this channel from the northward, keep Belle Hougue bluff open of Tour de Rozel point until Little Seymour beacon is just open westward of Seymour tower S.S.W., which mark leads inside the Chateau bank up to the anchorage. At any time after the first quarter flood, the heaviest ships may enter the North channel either with the mark just given or with No. 1 martello tower at La Roque point on with the Equerriere beacon S.W. \u00a3 S., passing over the Fara ledge ; the former has the great advantage for long heavy ships of making the turn to the lead ing mark through the Outer road, Coupe mound open of Verclut bluff, much less abrupt. To anchor as near the shore as possible, Coupe guard-house turret"], [265, "Chap, v.] 243 GROUVILLE BAY. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. may be shut in a little over Verclut point ; but, Little Seymour beacon should be kept perceptibly open westward of Seymour tower until Fort William is open southward of the Equerriere beacon to clear the Tres Grunes, or until the best anchoring lines, already given, are approached, when anchor as convenient. The South Channel is between the southern end of the Chateau bank and the reefs northward of the Anquettes, and, as the narrows are reached, between the Giffard rock and the South ridge of the Chateau bank, where it is only 3^ cables wide. The water is deep throughout, there being not less than 8 fathoms in mid channel at the lowest tides. Approaching this channel from the northward, to clear a rocky bank of 32 feet outside the Chateau bank, keep Coupe guard house turret outside St. Catherine's lighthouse N.N.W. \\ W. westerly, until Prince's tower comes on with Gorey pier-head, after which the guard-house may be brought inside the lighthouse as far as the outer arches of the breakwater ; and, when Icho tower opens southward of Little Seymour beacon, haul in round the southern end of the bank.

A large vessel working into the Outer road through the South channel should not open Icho tower southward of Seymour tower until Coupe guard-house is westward of the middle of St. Catherine's breakwater, in order to clear the Stony banks, of 25 feet least water, northward of the Petite Anquette.

As the line of Icho and Noirmont towers in one is approached, Coupe turret may be brought a little westward of the lighthouse ; and, when southward of this line and clear of the Grande Arconie, Coupe turret should be brought westward of the lighthouse at least one third the distance to Verclut point, to clear the western side of the Basse Occidentale des B\u0153ufs ; from whence, if bound for Granville, the same mark on astern and a S.S.E. course lead past the Basse le Marie bell buoy and up to the leading marks for the Cotentin .channel, see pages 186-190 ; or, if bound westward, a S.S.W. course leads to the channels between the Anquette gravel banks, see page 235, which banks may be always known and avoided by the tide ripples over them, and when La Moye white house opens of Le Fret point N.W. \\ W., the gravel banks are passed and a vessel may haul to the westward. In passing through this channel, it should be remembered that Coupe turret touching the outer part of St. Catherine's lighthouse leads over the Anquette north-eastern patch, and also over the Basse Occidentale des B\u0153ufs, the cross mark for the latter being Bergerie house on with the Rousse Platte rock N.W. \u00a3 W., or Coutances cathedral open northward of Blainville steeple S.E. by E. \\ E.

The vessel is then abreast of the Giffard rock, and Coupe guard-house turret a little open of Verclut point N. f W. becomes the leading mark with which to enter the Violet channel ; and, when approaching the narrows, be particular that Coupe guard-house turret is only just open eastward of the breakwater house at Verclut point. As a check, it is useful to know that if any part of St. Catherine's white martello tower shows eastward of Archirondel red tower you are quite far enough to the eastward. Another good mark for the middle of the channel when abreast of the Petit Four is, Rozel mill (without arms) touching the northern side of Mont Orgueil castle N. by W. 4, W. When abreast of the Petit Four, Karame rock just shut in with the high land above Noirmont point bears N.W. by W. } W. ; and, Grande Anquette beacon turret open northward of the Petite Anquette S.E. by E. easterly. From this position, steer to bring Coupe mound open of Verclut point and use it for the leading mark ; or, if the Rousse Platte rock is uncovered, steer direct for it on a S.W. bearing until Grande Anquette beacon turret bears E. 4, N. In either case, steer west ward with the Anquette beacon turret on that bearing until Icho tower is on with the Conchiere rock, when the vessel is clear of the Route en Ville reefs and may steer to pass 3 or 4 cables southward of the Conchiere rock. ANNE PORT BAY, between Grouville and St. Catherine bays, is small, and outlying rocks render the approach to it dangerous ; there is, however, good anchorage off it, occasionally used by fishing boats and other small craft in fine weather. The principal dangers are the Seven Grunes and the Cloches rocks. The Seven Grunes, form a long straggling reef extending 3\u00a3 cables eastward from the Grosse Moie ; the highest rock, near the middle of the reef, uncovers 7 feet, and the outer Grune, called Le Mont, has 5 feet water over it. The Cloches Rocks extend in an E. by S. \u00b1 S. direction 54, cables from Crete point to a rock with only one foot water ; they are the southern rocks of the Fara or St. Catherine's bank and several heads in-shore of the one-foot rock dry from one to 5 feet. Between the Cloches rocks and the Seven Grunes is the anchorage ; it is 24, cables in extent North and South, has an even depth of 44, or 5 fathoms, and is sheltered from the tide."], [268, "246 [Chap. V. CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. ST. CATHERINE'S BAY, on the eastern Shore of Jersey northward of Mont Orgueil castle, though much encumbered by rocks, affords excellent anchorage for small craft in 2 or 3 fathoms water, with a bottom of muddy sand covered with very long grass and seaweed ; it is difficult, however, for a sailing vessel to enter or leave except with a leading wind. The bay is completely sheltered from northerly, westerly, and south-westerly winds ; but, south-easterly and easterly winds blow right in and near high water cause a short, turbulent, chopping sea ; as the tide falls, however, the sea subsides. A harbour of refuge was begun in this bay in the year 1847. The northern pier or breakwater was completed in 1855, and extends 826 yards S.E. \u00a3 E. from Verclut point, the northern extreme of the bay, and over the rocky bed formerly called the Pierre Mouillee ; it has a depth of 5 fathoms at its outer end at low water, and on the pier-head stands the lighthouse. The pier has a lofty parapet, and, alongside it, a steam-vessel of large size might coal, water, land, or embark troops, with any wind from N.N.E. round by \"West to S.W. The southern breakwater was designed to extend in an easterly direction from the point near Archirondel tower across the Fara reef Of this, however, only about 200 yards has been built, and the work discontinued. Should the southern pier ever be completed and a harbour formed it might prove useful in bringing Jersey into closer commercial relations with France ; but, from the great strength of the tides across the entrance of the bay, and from the dangerous rocks near, it is now difficult of access to sailing vessels in bad weather, and only fit for ordinary use by steam-vessels. LIGHT. \u2014 A white octagonal iron lighthouse, 30 feet high from base to vane, stands on the outer extreme of the parapet wall of Verclut breakwater. It exhibits a fixed white light of the fifth order at 60 feet above the level of high water, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 12 miles. DANGERS off and in ST. CATHERINE'S BAY.\u2014 The approach to St. Catherine's bay from the South-east is completely barred by St. Catherine or Fara bank, a large bed of rocks about half a mile square, of which the outer part extends three quarters of a mile eastward of Archirondel tower. The rocks begin to uncover about the last quarter ebb, many show at low water but by far the greater number never dry. On the southern edge of the bank are the Cloches, already"], [269, "Chap. V.] st. Catherine's bay.\u2014 dangers. 247 described ; on the eastern side, the Fara rock, half a cable wide, which dries 9 feet and, with a pole beacon in its centre, is the most con spicuous rock ; also, on the eastern side, the Grune du Nord which dries one foot ; and within, on the North-west and North, the Basses de Fara, and the Etot rock which dries 10 feet. Fara Ledge, about one third of a mile south-eastward of the Fara beacon, is a rocky bank about a cable in length E.S.E. and W.N.W., rather more than half that width, and about the same distance detached from a depth of 2 feet on the edge of St. Catherine's bank. The least known depth is 21 feet near its eastern end, but there may be a foot or two less. No. 2 martello tower in Grouville bay and the Equerriere beacon in line S.W. just clears the south-eastern side ; and, Little Seymour beacon on with Seymour tower S.S.W. touches its western extreme. This latter mark also leads over the outer part of St. Catherine's bank in 28 feet but close to a 17-feet patch ; Coupe guard house on with St. Catherine's lighthouse N.N.W. W., or a little open eastward of it, leads outside the Fara ledge and reef and between them and the Eureka and Pillon rocks up to the lighthouse. Eureka Rock, with 12 feet water, lies 2\\ cables from the light house, with the northern side of the breakwater slightly open, and No. 4 martello tower just shut in with Orgueil point. The Pillon Rock has only 4 feet water ; it bears due North 1^ cables from the Eureka rock, and is 2 cables from the breakwater end. From the rock, St. Martin's spire is on with the lighthouse ; and, No. 3 martello tower is just shut in with Orgueil point. Within St. Catherine's bay, in line between the lighthouse and Archirondel tower and nearly 2 cables from the lighthouse, is a rock with only 8 feet water ; another rock with only 7 feet lies northward of a line drawn from the lighthouse to St. Catherine's martello tower, with Coupe guard-house just showing over Verclut point. Caution.\u2014 During spring tides, the stream sets with great velocity over St. Catherine's bank into the bay and also round the end of the breakwater, for which due allowance must be made in entering or leaving the bay. Anchorage. \u2014 There is barely room for one large ship to anchor in St. Catherine's bay. The best berth is in 5 fathoms water about a cable distant from the breakwater and \\\\ cables westward from the lighthouse."], [270, "248 [Chap. V. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. Small vessels may anchor farther up the bay in 2 fathoms, with St. Martin's spire on with the southern extreme of the bluff northward of St. Catherine's martello tower W. by N. J N. ; and, Seymour tower on with Grosse Moie S. by W. One cable in-shore of this, there is only one fathom, and the same distance off-shore 3\u00a3 fathoms. The bottom is a mixture of fine sand and mud throughout. Directions.\u2014 From Grouville to St. Catherine's Bay \u2014 Run out from Gorey Inner road with Prince's tower open north ward of Fort William until Little Seymour beacon is just westward of Seymour tower, which mark clears the Tres Grunes and foul ground outside them ; having passed these, bring Little Seymour beacon and Seymour tower exactly in line S.S.W. to pass inside Fara ledge, in 23 feet ; or, No. 2 tower a little open south-eastward of Equerriere beacon S.W. to pass outside Fara ledge. With Coupe guard-house on with St. Catherine's lighthouse, a vessel is clear of all the rocks of St. Catherine's bank, and may steer for the lighthouse, hauling into the bay, when a cable distant from it, with St. Martin's spire nearly shut in over the bluff northward of St. Catherine's martello tower for a leading mark, and anchoring as convenient by the marks just given. There is another passage into this bay from the southward between the Cloches and Crete point, which, though much encumbered by rocks nearly awash at low water, may be useful occasionally to small craft with pilots. A very useful mark for this small channel during the lower part of the tide is, St. Catherine's martello tower on with the eastern side of Little Fara rock to clear Le Mont, the outer rock of the Seven Grunes ; and, having passed that danger, open the tower a little inside the Little Fara before passing Crete point, to clear the rocks along the inner part of St. Catherine's bank. A vessel may pass close inside the Little Fara in 9 feet at low water, ordinary springs. Coupe Point is a bluff about 180 feet high, and so named from its being connected with the neighbouring land by a narrow neck of little more than half that height. On the summit of the bluff is a ruined guard-house surmounted by a stone sentry box or turret, which serves as a conspicuous and very useful mark. An extensive range of farm buildings stands near the edge of the plateau south ward of and overlooking the Coupe ; two high rocks lie half a cable outside the bluff, from which a dangerous reef extends 2 cables eastward."], [271, "Chap. V.] ST. CATHERINE'S BAY.\u2014 DIRECTIONS.\u2014 FLIQUET BAY. 249 FLIQUET BAY is between Verclut and Coupe points, and affords good shelter from south-westerly winds, but is quite exposed to those from South round by East and North to W.N.W. As Gorey road affords no shelter with southerly winds, vessels bound to Gorey harbour, during strong winds from that quarter and not able to save their tide in, may anchor under shelter of the breakwater until two hours flood, when they will still have sufficient southerly tide to enable them to reach the road by the time there is water enough to enter the harbour. No vessel, however, should anchor in this bay with the intention of remaining longer than a tide, for a shift of wind to S.E. or N.E. would place her in a dangerous position. The bottom is hard sand, free from any foul ground except the Brayes, a small group of rocks which dry and extend If cables from Coupe point ; and, the Coupe rock, with 10 feet water, S.E. by E. h E. 4^ cables from Coupe guard-house turret, and North a little easterly 5f cables from St. Catherine's lighthouse. The white patch in the centre of the northern side of the breakwater on with Mont Orgueil castle leads outside the Coupe rock. Telegraph Cable. \u2014 The electric cable between Jersey and France is laid in a S.E. by E. \\ E. direction from Fliquet bay to Pirou on the French coast, see page 168. The shore end in Jersey is at the white martello tower in Fliquet bay, on which is painted in black letters the word Telegraph, surmounted by a green disc. To prevent damage to the cable, or loss of anchors, grapnels, or dredges, by the fishermen, the following directions are given : \u2014 The course of the cable is distinctly indicated by the two towers, which are a sufficient guide during the day for clearing it. Fishing boats without a compass may avoid it on the South by not opening the Tour de Rozel northward of Coupe point ; and, on the North, by not shutting in the guard-house in Bouley bay with the Tour de Rozei. Anchorage. \u2014 From the northward, Seymour house, on the hill northward of Gorey, on with or a little eastward of the breakwater house under Verclut point S.S.W. \\ W. leads between the Brayes and Coupe irock ; and, from the eastward, Rozel mill on with Fliquet telegraph tower W.N.W. leads between the Pillon and Coupe rocks. The best anchorage, with southerly or south-westerly winds, is in 6 fathoms midway between the breakwater and the Coupe rock, with Nez du Guet and Coupe point in line N.W. \\ N. ; and, the Martello tower on the hill northward of Mont Orgueil castle on with the centre of the breakwater S.S.W. f W. Care is required in taking up"], [272, "[Chap. V. 250 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. this anchorage, as it is only a cable northward of the telegraph cable. With westerly winds, anchor nearer Coupe point in about the centre of the bay. \u2022 \u25a0 ROZEL BAY.\u2014 N.W. \\ N. nearly one mile from Coupe point is Nez du Guet, and between them is Rozel bay, which, being exposed to all winds from S. by E. round by East to N.W. by N., is only used as an anchorage to await sufficient water to enter the harbour. In addition to the foul ground off the points of the bay, there is a rocky group called the Hiaux, which uncovers 3 feet, one cable from the western shore and 1\u00a3 cables from the pier-head, Avith Rozel hotel on with the white patch on the pier-head ; and, also a sunken rock with 5 feet water on the eastern side of the entrance to the harbour, one cable from the shore. Rozel Harbour. \u2014 This small but useful harbour in the western part of Rozel bay has a stone pier capable of affording shelter to 20 small cutters, such as are employed in the oyster fishery. A great quantity of cider is shipped here during the summer months, and the harbour affords berthing places to six vessels of from 40 to 50 tons. North-westerly winds cause a great range, so that vessels fre quently carry away the large hawsers used in mooring alongside the pier. Gorey harbour is preferable to Rozel in every respect. The mouth of the harbour is much obstructed by a large, flat, half tide rock, on the southern side of the entrance, between which and the pier-head there is only room for two small vessels to enter abreast ; with a foul wind, vessels are obliged to kedge in or out. Directions. \u2014 Entering Rozel harbour from the northward, keep St. Catherine's lighthouse in sight outside Coupe point until the Royal hotel at Rozel is southward of the white patch on the pier-head W. by S., which mark leads southward of the Hiaux, and to the entrance of the harbour. Give the pier-head a close shave, to avoid the half tide rock just described. If waiting tide to enter the harbour, the best anchorage is in the north-western part of the bay, with the Royal hotel on with the white patch on the pier-head, and the lower and upper part of the wall of Nez du Guet fort in line, or, the two chimneys of the guard-house in the fort in line. To keep outside the Hiaux, do not shut in the Tour de Rozel with the Nez du Guet. Tides.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Rozel bay at 6 h. 15 m. ; springs rise 30 feet, neaps 2H feet."], [273, "Chap. V.] ROZEL HARBOUR. \u2014 BOULEY BAY. 251 Tour de Rozel forms a most useful mark ; it is a conical mass of rock 155 feet high, detached from the point within it, and about 4 cables westward of Rozel bay. A half-tide rock, the Demie de la Tour, lies three quarters of a cable outside it ; with this exception the approach to it is quite safe. BOULEY BAY, on the northern side of Jersey, between Tour de Rozel and Belle Hougue point, affords good shelter with the wind from W. by N. round by South to S.S.E. The only dangers in and near this bay are, the Oyster rocks, the Troupeurs, the Sambues, and the Grune de Vicard, a small rock near the western shore. Oyster Rocks are 2f cables in-shore of the Troupeurs, 1^ cables N.N.E. from Meulet point, and dry 13 feet at low water. Troupeurs Rocks, near the middle of the bay, are the two highest heads of a small rocky bank, which bear from each other about N.E. and S.W. one third of a cable ; the outer head has 10 feet water, the inner head 7 feet. From the outer head, the inner high rock of the Pierres de Lecq is a little open of Belle Hougue point N.W. \\ W. westerly ; and, the western side of Meulet point on with the western side of the high cliff immediately above it S. by W. \\ W. The whole of the Pierres de Lecq well open of Belle Hougue point leads northward of the Troupeurs ; and, the largest rock of the Pierres de Lecq group, near the middle, shut in behind Belle Hougue point leads southward. The Sambues are nearly 4 cables eastward of Belle Hougue point, and extend nearly a quarter of a mile from the shore ; they uncover soon after half ebb. Coupe guard-house turret on with Tour de Rozel point S.E. f S. leads outside the Sambues, Troupeurs, and all shoal ground off Belle Hougue point. Grune de Vicard is nearly a cable from the shore between the two guard-houses and has 2 feet water over it. Anchorage. \u2014 To anchor outside the Troupeurs in from 8 to 10 fathoms, gravel bottom, keep the whole of the Pierres de Lecq at least a point open of Belle Hougue point, or Coupe guard-house open of Tour de Rozel point ; and, the white tower of Castle house, on the high land overlooking the bay, on with Bouley pier S.W. \\ S. Or further in, with the white tower of the Castle house open of the pier S.W. by W. ; and, Belle Hougue point, seen over the land, a little"], [274, "[Chap. V. 252 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. northward of Vicard point N.W. f N. in 5 fathoms, fine sand. This is a safe anchorage with southerly winds, but open to those from the northward. Directions. \u2014 To enter Bouley bay from the eastward, steer in with the slate-roofed house, on the western side of the bay above the pier, on with the pier end, West ; this leads between the Demie de la Tour, on which the tide sets strongly, and the Troupeurs rocks up to the anchorage in 4\u00a3 fathoms. Vessels anchored in this bay during south-westerly gales should be prepared to weigh directly the wind begins to veer to N.W., and run either to St. Catherine's bay or Gorey road. BELLE HOUGUE POINT, about a mile westward of the anchorage in Bouley bay, is the highest and, except Grosnez, the most remarkable headland on the northern coast of Jersey. From it, a reef of sunken rocks extends 2 cables off-shore ; this reef is cleared on its north-eastern side by keeping Coupe turret open of the Tour de Rozel, and, on its northern side, by keeping Plemont point in sight outside Ronez point. Off the north-eastern coast of Jersey are the Ecrehos and Drouilles shoals, which, with their off -lying banks and rocks, together cover a distance of 7\u00a7 miles N.W. \u00a3 W. and S.E. \\ E., and have an extreme width of 2^ miles. Between them and Jersey is Le Ruau, a clear, navigable channel, 2\\ miles wide at its narrowest part, and greatly protected during north-easterly gales by these reefs. ECREHOS ROCKS, about one third of the distance between the north-eastern coast of Jersey and cape de Carteret, are at the eastern part of these reefs, and are separated from the Drouilles to the westward, and the Ecreviere banks to the eastward, by very narrow and shallow channels. The main group of the Ecrehos rocks occupy a space near the centre of the reef 1\\ miles in extent North and South and 8 cables wide, the whole of which space dries before low water. Maitre ile, 60 feet high, is the largest of the group, and is at the south-eastern extreme of this part of the reef ; along the steep eastern side of the reef, to the north ward, are the rocky islets Marmotier, Blanc ile, Tas de Pois, and Vielle ; the two latter being conical rocks 50 and 54 feet high respec tively. On the south-western side are the high rocks Cotes and Colombier ; and, northward of them, the Grosse Tete and Petite Tete, the latter being the only one that ever covers with the tide."], [275, "Chap, v.] ECREHOS ROCKS. 253 Maitre ile, Marmotier, and Blanc ile are the largest of the Ecrehos group, and on each there are huts for the use of fishermen. Maitre ile alone is large enough to preserve its soil from being swept away by wind and sea and is therefore the only islet having any vegetation, which consists of coarse grass and a few stunted shrubs. Large rats abound, but neither fresh water nor fuel are to be found on any of these islets, which are, however, visited by Jerseymen during the summer season, for the purpose of fishing and cutting vraic. Maitre ile being one of the principal stations for the survey of Jersey, the exact position of the instrument is marked by a pole surmounted by a barrel with a large pile of stones at its base ; it stands on the highest part of the island near the middle, and is a conspicuous and useful beacon. Along the eastern side of the main reef of the Ecrehos, but sepa rated from it by a narrow channel, is a tangled mass of rocky reefs, narrow at its northern end near the Vielle but widening and increasing its distance from the main reef as it extends southward, with an outward curve to abreast of Maitre ile, from which its outer edge is a mile distant. Here the rocks suddenly terminate and the Ecreviere bank, of gravel and sand, commences and extends nearly 2 miles farther southward. Of the rocky reef described, only those rocks used for sailing marks, viz., the Bigorne, Sabloniere, and Grande Galere, need special notice. Bigorne, a very remarkable horned rock, 20 feet above high water, lies 4 cables eastward of Maitre ile. Sabloniere and Grande Galere, If and 2f cables north-eastward of Bigorne, are not so high but never cover. Ecreviere Rock, the south-easternmost of the Ecrehos group, covers 8 feet at high water, springs, and bears E. by S. three quarters of a mile from Maitre ile. The Ecreviere bank extends from the Ecreviere rock to its southern edge in 5 fathoms S. fry E. f E. nearly 2 miles. Its greatest breadth, near the northern end, is half a mile, and it tapers off to about 2 cables wide at its southern extreme. The bank is very steep along its western side ; its surface consists of a number of ridges of fine gravel and sand, convex to the south westward, nearly parallel with and close to each other, drying from 3 to 5 feet, and separated only by narrow channels from 3 to 8 feet in depth. The stream setting over this bank causes a confused sea in bad"], [276, "[Chap. V. 254 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. weather. Bigorne rock and Tas de Pois in line N.N.W. \\ W. mark the direction of the southern end of the bank, and, by opening these objects of each other one point either way, the end of the bank may be rounded as necessary. Grouville mill on with Orgueil bluff leads over the bank a quarter of a mile within its southern extreme, where it is awash at low water. St. Martin's spire on with the upper house on the northern side of Verclut point bearing West, or Rozel mill open southward of Coupe turret W. \\ N., leads clear of its southern end. Ronde Selhere, the southernmost of the Ecrehos rocks, uncovers 7 feet ; from it, Marmotier islet appears on with the high eastern extreme of Maitre ile, and St. Martin's spire open northward of Fliquet tower bears W. by S. Another rock of similar character and appearance, but drying 8 feet, lies If cables north-westward of this ; and a third, the Petite Noire, drying 12 feet, about the same distance northward, the three rocks forming nearly an equilateral triangle. A reef, awash at low water, lies one cable eastward of the Ronde Selhere. These rocks may be cleared on their south-western side by shutting in Plemont point behind Ronez point. St. Martin's spire on with Fliquet tower W. f S. southerly leads southward. Tas de Pois on with the eastern side of Marmotier N. by W. \\ W. leads between Ronde Selhere and the Ecreviere bank. To keep outside the Grande Noire rocks the whole of Petite Rousse rocks must be well open southward of the high rocks of Maitre ile. Bigorne rock, seen mid way between Sabloniere and Grande Galere rocks N. E. \\ N. clears the Ronde Selhere rocks on their western side and leads up to the Maitre ile anchorage. Anchorage for small vessels only may be found southward of Maitre ile and within Ronde Selhere. The best berth is in 5 fathoms, gravel, with Marmotier houses just open eastward of Maitre ile, North ; and, Bigorne midway between Grande Galere and Sabloniere N.E. \\ N. Large vessels should anchor in 8 fathoms, gravel, outside the line of Ronde Selhere rocks and Ecreviere bank, with Tas de Pois on with the eastern extreme of Marmotier. Nipple Rock forms the outer western corner of the western entrance to Maitre ile inner anchorage ; the rock near its centre dries 16 feet ; at this spot, the Grande Galere is open southward of Maitre"], [277, "Chap.

The Vraic, a rock which dries 5 feet, lies S.E. by E. f E. 3 cables from the Nipple rock ; Sabloniere and Bigorne rocks in line lead over the Vraic rock. The Demies are two rocks scarcely a cable apart, whose summits dry 18 and 19 feet and are just at the half-tide level ; the outer rock bears N.W. northerly 6 cables from Nipple rock and is nearly 5 cables westward of the Ecrehos main reef.

Several rocks uncover \\\\ cables westward of the Demies, and sunken dangers with only 5 feet water lie nearly 3 cables in that direction. Rouquet reef consists of several detached masses of sunken rocks on the northern side of the Ecrehos reef and separated from it by narrow channels of deep water. The highest rock of the eastern mass is awash at low water ; from it, St. Catherine's lighthouse mid way between the martello tower northward of Mont Orgueil and the end of the plateau above Gorey bears S.W. f S. ; and, Maitre ile beacon midway between Grosse Tete and the Vielle S.S.E. \\ E.

THE RUAU CHANNEL, between the Drouilles rocks and Jersey, is at its narrowest part 2\u00a3 miles wide, from 12 to 18 fathoms deep, and free from danger, but the confused sea caused by a strong weather tide over the rocky uneven bottom is sometimes so violent as to resemble breakers. The northern entrance to the Ruau, between the Drouilles and Pierres de Lecq, and sometimes called the Drouilles channel, is 4^ miles wide and free from danger ; the approach from the westward, between the Pierres de Lecq and Jersey, is also roomy and safe ; and, any sea man with a good chart may safely take his vessel through the Ruau channel and into Gorey outer road without a pilot. When the marks are indistinct, or at night, vessels should endeavour to keep in mid-channel when passing between the Pierres de Lecq and the Jersey coast, and through the Ruau channel. PASSE DE L'ETOC is the principal passage between the Drouilles and Ecrehos reefs ; it leaves to the westward the whole of the Drouilles rocks ; and, to the eastward, the Grande Rousse, Etoc, and Fierco rocks, besides the Grune du Nord-Ouest, Grune du Sud- Ouest, and many others. The narrowest part of the channel is between the Platte rock and Grune du Sud-Ouest, where it is only 3 cables wide.

The same may be done to give a good berth to a 7-feet rock which lies with Tas de Pois and the Etoc rock in line. The Passe de l'Etoc has a general depth of 8 fathoms, and the bottom, although very rocky, is tolerably regular ; both tides, how ever, set across it for a considerable time, and no stranger should attempt to pass through without a pilot.

Near the middle of the bay, about 2 cables from the shore, is the Cheval, a large black rock which only covers at high spring tides, with several sunken rocks half a cable outside it. A reef extends 2\u00a3 cables northward from Fremont point ; at its outer extreme is the Demie, a rock which dries 16 feet. Anchorage.\u2014 The best berth is about a quarter of a mile north ward of Crete point, in from 6 to 8 fathoms, sand and gravel. A vessel here is well sheltered from southerly and westerly winds, but should be prepared to slip in case of a sudden shift of wind to the northward. Shamrock Bank is a bed of rocks nearly 400 yards in diameter, The least water, 9 feet, is at the southern part of the bank, and there are from 6 to 12 fathoms close round it. From the 9-feet rock, Fremont point well open westward of the Demie rock bears S. f E. 6 cables ; Plemont hotel just within the outer part of Ronez point W. by N. \u00a3 N. ; the western house of St. John's barrack is a little open eastward of Fremont point ; and, Tour de Rozel is over the outer extreme of Belle Hougue point. Plemont and Ronez points in line W. by N. N. northerly lead in-shore of the Shamrock bank, a close mark for the 9-feet patch. St. John's Bay, between Fremont and Ronez points, is but a slight indentation of the coast ; its shore is, moreover, so fringed with rocks as to be almost inaccessible, and outlying rocks extend in some parts nearly 2 cables from the shore, between which and the Shamrock bank is a passage 4 cables wide. Strangers are advised, however, not to attempt passing through this channel without a pilot, nor to approach the land hereabout nearer than a mile. This part of the coast is remarkable from the extensive granite quarries which add to its naturally barren and wild appearance. RONEZ, SOREL, AND PLEMONT POINTS, unlike Belle Hougue and Grosnez points, are all low at their outer extremes, but rise at rather steep inclines to the high level plateau, which is the remarkable feature of the northern coast of the island, at distances of but little more than a quarter of a mile. Ronez and Sorel points are steep-to, but between and half a cable outside them is the Grune de Vicq, a sunken rock with only 3 feet R 2"], [282, "260 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. [Chap.

Plaine Point has a reef extending half a cable from it; outside of which, however, it is steep-to. From Plaine point to Greve de Lecq the coast is cliffy, pre cipitous, and dangerous of approach, having outlying reefs and sunken rocks extending more than a quarter of a mile from the shore. GREVE DE LECQ BAY is near the middle of the bight between Sorel and Plemont points ; its position may be recognised at a distance by a whitewashed martello tower over the middle of its high sandy beach. The anchorage off Greve de Lecq is good and safe with all except northerly winds ; the best position is in from 9 to 6 fathoms, sand, with Greve de Lecq martello tower bearing between S. by W. and S.S.W. \\ W. from 4 to 6 cables distant ; at the inner and western position, Plemont point is open of the Grand Becquet. The dangers in or near Greve de Lecq are as follows : \u2014 The Demies, of which the highest dries 16 feet, 1\u00a7 cables from the eastern headland of the bay, and N.E. by N. 3^ cables from the white martello tower. This rock is surrounded by others which dry at low water to the distance of half a cable, and the ground between them and the shore is rocky and foul. Grune de Becquet, with 21 feet water, bears N.E. \u00a3 E. 5f cables from Grand Becquet head. From the rock, Grosnez point seen over the low point of Plemont bears W. by N., and Greve de Lecq martello tower S. by W. Grune de Douet, with 12 feet water, is 3^ cables in-shore of the Grune de Becquet, and E. f N. 3 cables from Grand Becquet head. GREVE AU LANCON BAY, between Plemont and Grosnez points, is small but remarkable from its fine level white sandy beach, which, however, unlike Greve de Lecq, is entirely covered by the tide long before high water ; at which time, the sea rolls into the numerous caverns of the cliffs bounding the bay, cutting off all communication with the high land above and imparting a wild aspect to the coast. The dangers here are, a rock which dries 14 feet one cable from the shore, on the western side of the bay ; and the"], [283, "Chap, v.] GREVE DE LECQ. \u2014 PIERRES DE LECQ. 261 reef extending a cable from Plemont point, which dries at low water. Small vessels bound southward round Grosnez point between half flood and half ebb, and unable to stem the tide, may advantageously anchor in this bay until half ebb, when the southern tide will have made and favour their proceeding through the swashway ; or, if eastward bound between the Pierres de Lecq and the island, and having anchored on the ebb, they can weigh at low water and carry a fair tide as far as Coupe point. The best anchorage is off the middle of the bay, with Grosnez bluff bearing about West, in from 9 to 6 fathoms, sand, but the holding ground is not good and a sailing vessel approaching or leaving the bay must be prepared for unsteady flaws of wind from the high land and varying eddies of tide. Caution. \u2014 No sailing vessel should anchor in any of the bays along the northern shore of Jersey with a northerly wind, but, should a vessel be surprised at anchor by a sudden shift of wind to that quarter, it may be advisable not to weigh until the weather tide makes, in order to ensure getting out. PIERRES DE LECQ or PATERNOSTERS is a rocky group, of which the western end in 5\u00a3 fathoms bears N.E. by N. 2f miles from Grosnez point ; they are nearly abreast of Greve de Lecq bay, and their central and highest rock bears N.N.E. northerly 2f miles from the white martello tower in that bay. Four large rocks, from 20 to 30 feet above high water, lie near the middle but towards the south-eastern side of the reef ; the Great rock is the most southern and highest of these ; from it, the reef dries in numerous places north-westward for nearly a mile ; and, south-eastward of the Great rock, are rocky banks, of which the outer one, with 20 feet water, is distant 6 cables from it. The most dangerous rock in this quarter is the Grune de Lecq, which dries 2 feet and bears S. by E. \u00a3 E. 4^ cables from the Great rock.

By night, St. Catherine's breakwater fixed ivhite light kept opening and shutting in with the Coupe point S.S.E. leads in mid-channel between the Pierres de Lecq and the Drouilles. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The necessity for taking regular and careful soundings cannot be too deeply impressed on the mind of the mariner when approaching the Channel islands, or when navigating amongst them at night or in thick weather ; for, although the islands and reefs generally are steep-to, so that the lead may give little or no warning of their near neighbourhood, it is possible for a vessel to be set inside their boundaries without seeing them, when a knowledge of the depth might enable her to anchor and thus save the vessel. Mariners are also cautioned against placing dependence on making out the distant marks for out-lying dangers, many of which can only be distinguished in very clear weather and by those acquainted with the localities. Moreover, there are extensive banks of gravel and sand amongst the islands as well as other occasional irregularities in the bottom, which the careful pilot would know how to turn to account in estimating his position ; and, on the French coast eastward of the islands, the soundings are generally so regular that the lead may be taken as a safe guide in estimating distances from that shore. When the position is uncertain and the lead is hove, it is often useful to keep it on the ground for a minute or two in order to note the direction and strength of the tidal stream. For, as the streams vary considerably both in strength and direction, according to position, and as diagrams giving precise information on this subject are engraved on the charts, a reference to the chart with the know ledge thus gained may be very useful. When the stream is running strongly, tide ripples and overfalls always make their appearance over sunken rocks, out-lying banks, or other exposed places ; in foggy weather, therefore, such indications may be turned to good account. In thick weather an anchor should always be ready when navigating among the islands ; but, before letting go, if possible, always turn the vessel's head to the tide, or there will be great danger of snapping the cable."], [285, "Chap. V.] GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 APPROACH BY NIGHT. 263 APPROACHES BY NIGHT.\u2014 From the \"Westward- Endeavour to make either the Hanois or Roches-Douvres light and fix the position of the ship accurately by bearings before shaping a course for the Corbiere light or for Grosnez point, according to whether the vessel is proceeding by the southern or northern coast of the island. Should a vessel pass inside the line of these lights in thick weather without seeing them, the lead ought to be frequently hove until the Corbiere light is seen and the position ascertained beyond doubt. On the meridian of the Hanois, 34 fathoms will be obtained, shoaling to 32 and 30 fathoms along the Deroute channel as far as Serk ; whilst, southward of a line drawn from the Roches- Douvres to Grosnez point, the depths vary between 26 and 23 fathoms. If bound for St. Helier, when within 2 or 3 miles westward of the Corbiere it is safest to heave to and wait for daylight. In thick weather, do not approach the Corbiere into less than 17 or 18 fathoms, and lay the vessel's head N.W. by N. during the whole of the flood, as the stream sets strongly down towards the Minquiers, and many vessels have been lost on that reef through neglecting this precaution. A steam-vessel of light draught with a good pilot, in a fine clear night and during the upper half of the tide, may safely proceed from this position to St. Helier harbour. Having brought the Corbiere light to bear East distant 2^ or 2 miles, she should steer direct for Noirmont point, which should be approached within a quarter of a mile, and, from thence, she should steer out a little to ensure clearing the Pignonet rock ; then, E. by S. for the entrance of the Little road, keeping a look out for the green and red leading lights on Albert pier, and when they are in line keeping them so up to the entrance of the harbour ; see also directions, pages 221-228.

Should there not be too much swell, a vessel could anchor for a time on the Great bank in from 5 to 8 fathoms N.W. by N. about 1\u00a3 miles from Corbiere light ; or between this position and No. 4 martello tower in St. Ouen bay, where the water is generally smoother and the tide not so strong. From the Northward.\u2014 Having made cape de la Hague light, enter the Race of Alderney, see page 346, as near mid-channel as possible, and, from thence, steer S. by W. or S.W. by S., according to the state of the tide, passing 4 or 5 miles eastward of the Bane de la Schole. Should the weather be clear, the position of the ship may be ascertained and the course regulated by the coast lights with accuracy. If the lights are obscured, it is best not to enter the Race until daylight ; but, if compelled to do so, remember that a moderate depth and good anchorage may always be secured by hauling in towards the French coast.* Should there be too much swell to anchor, and the weather be moderately clear, Serk is very steep-to and safe of approach except on a north-westerly bearing, in the direction of the Blanchard rock. During the upper half of the tide, if it is desired to maintain a position near Serk, bring the middle of that island to bear S.W. ; and, during the lower half, N.N.E. ; in calm weather, the drift will then be away from the island. From the middle of the Race towards the eastern coast of Jersey, to pass through the Drouilles channel, steer as directed until cape de Carteret light bears E. by S. St. Catherine's light should now be seen if the weather is clear, and, kept opening and shutting in with Coupe point S.S.E., it leads nearly midway between the Drouilles and Belle Hougue point.

Should St. Catherine's light not be seen when cape de Carteret light bears E. by S., proceed with caution ; bearing in mind that from the northernmost of the Pierres de Lecq, cape de Carteret light bears E. \\ S., and that a line drawn from the one to the other clears * In easterly winds there is good anchorage in Vauville bay southward of cape de la Hague, and all along the coast to nearly abreast of cape de Carteret 3 or 4 miles from the land in from 12 to 14 fathoms ; see also pages 180-183 and 187."], [287, "Chap, v.] APPROACH BY NIGHT.\u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. 265 the northern extreme of the Drouilles reef by a mile. The Drouilles are all so low that they would hardly be seen at night until a vessel was amongst them ; but, as they are faced on their northern side by a fringe of sunken reef or bank, the lead, if carefully attended to, should give warning of their neighbourhood. The Pierres de Lecq being steep-to on the eastern side and some part of the rocks always visible, are much safer to approach at night than the Drouilles. Of course neither these nor any other dangers should be approached under circumstances of difficulty with the tide. Grosnez bluff bearing W. by S. just clears the inner or southern edge of the Pierres de Lecq reef. If bound through the Deroute channel round the western coast of Jersey, from the middle of the Race steer S. by W. or S.W. by S., as before directed, until cape de Carteret light bears E.S.E., to clear the Blanchard rock off Serk ; then haul out westward into the Deroute channel clear of the Pierres de Lecq and of the Bane Desormes, and when the Corbiere white light is in sight bearing S. by E. \u00a3 E. a S. by W. course may be steered until within 2 or 3 miles abreast of the Corbiere rock, where a vessel should heave-to and wait for day light, or act as already directed in coming from the westward. TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 Along the northern and southern shores of the island, between Grosnez point and Belle Hougue point on the North, and between Corbiere rock and Seymour tower on the South, the whole of the flood stream runs eastward and the jebb westward, following the trend of the land, and each for 6 hours, the velocity at springs being about 4 knots, and at neaps about 2 knots. In Grouville, St. Catherine, and St. Ouen bays, the stream runs northward between half flood and half ebb, and southward between half ebb and half flood, with a velocity in each case of 4| knots at springs and 2^ knots at neaps ; the streams consequently meet off the four extremes of the island, viz., Coupe point, Grosnez point, Corbiere point, and the Conchiere rock. The rotary changes of direction of the tidal stream round Jersey being the governing cause of the various sets close to its shores, some description of its action is necessary. Assuming, therefore, the time of high water and a position about 4 miles S.W. of St. Helier, the stream which has been hitherto setting S.E. and East now quickly alters its direction to N.E., which a glance at the chart will show is full on to the southern coast of the island, making the space included between the assumed position and the land what pilots call the crown of the tide, and causing slack water as the shore is approached."], [288, "266 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. [Chap. V. The northern side of the island, at this time lying in the lee or eddy, slack water is caused there also ; but, along the eastern and western coasts, the tide is setting northward at its full strength. At half ebb, the offing stream has veered round from North to N.W. and S.W. ; the crown of the tide is now on the eastern side of Jersey, and the western side is in the lee or eddy, causing slack water at this time in Grouville and St. Ouen bays at the opposite ends of the island, the stream at the same time running at its full strength westward along the northern and southern coasts of the island. At low water, the stream is setting from the northward on to the northern shore of Jersey, making the crown of the tide on that side and the lee on the southern side of the island, causing slack water on those sides whilst the stream is running with its full strength southward along the eastern and western sides. At half flood, the crown of the tide is on the western coast, the lee on the eastern side with slack water on those sides, whilst the stream is setting with its full strength eastward along the northern and southern shores. A careful consideration of this rotary action of the tidal stream serves to explain all peculiarities of the tides in the bays of the island. Thus, at Noirmont point near half flood, when the eastern stream attains its full strength, there is an outset from St. Aubin bay, which runs with considerable strength between Pointe de But and the Pignonet rocks, and is perceptible within the bay as far as St. Aubin castle ; at first, this is a mere eddy of the flood stream originating under Noirmont point, but as, after half flood, the stream shifts from East to N.E. and sets right on the Hermitage rocks and Elizabeth castle, the very gentle incline of the sandy shore here and the great space to be covered causes the level of the sea at this part of the bay to be considerably raised above that of the western side, and the water of course runs off in the direction of the lower level. On referring to the chart it will be seen that the form of the bay tends to deflect the stream from a north-easterly to a northerly direction ; it is not, therefore, difficult to understand why the small eddy under Noirmont point, when reinforced by the westerly flow round the head of the bay, becomes the continuous outset from Noirmont point just described ; this outset runs for 9 hours, viz., from half flood to high water and during the whole of the ebb ; it attains its greatest strength about an hour after high water, and at this time, during a westerly gale at spring tides, it throws up a dangerous breaking sea or race off Noirmont point."], [289, "Chap, v.] TIDAL STREAMS. 267 From similar causes, viz., the shifting and impinging on the land of the offing stream, the tide sets northward across the mouth as well as into the harbour of St. Helier during the whole of the flood, and southward during the ebb, except near the Bridge inside Eliza beth castle, where the tide sets north-westward from the last quarter flood until the Bridge is awash at one foot less than half tide. In the offing, south-westward and clear of the island, the strength of both tidal streams runs in a N.W. and S.E. direction, remain ing longer near those points than any other ; and, it has been already shown that near high water it quickly changes its course to East and North-east, at this latter point running full on the island and making high water there. It does not, however, continue in this direction for any length of time, but veers round by North to a north-westerly direction, where its shifting movement is much slower ; the strength of this north-western stream is felt at half ebb on the southern coast of Jersey. To arrive at a right understanding of the force and effect of the ocean swell along the southern coast of Jersey in westerly gales it is necessary to follow this changing direction of the offing stream. An hour before high water, on the slacking of the south-eastern stream in the offing, the western stream sets round Noirmont point to the westward, checking the advancing westerly swell during gales from that quarter, and causing it to break heavily. As this natural breakwater forms off Noirmont point and its outlying reefs, the water within and to leeward, both in St. Aubin bay and St. Helier road, becomes smoother, and, as the western or ebb stream increases in strength so does the swell continue to decrease. After the tide has fallen below half ebb, the outlying reefs, gradually uncovering, assist materially in blocking out the swell, but, after low water, the offing stream changes, and the westerly swell rolls in again with the eastern stream, increasing in force with the rising tide, until again checked by the slacking of the offing stream and the making of the western stream in-shore."], [290, "268 CHAPTER VI.

A particular description of Guernsey, Herm, and Serk now follow.* GUERNSEY \u2014 The most remarkable objects which first present themselves when running for the south-western end of Guernsey are, the light-tower on the Hanois rocks, the white castellated tower of Fort Grey in the centre of the sandy bay of Rocquaine, Plein mont guard-house, Torteval church spire, and Eree tower, on a hummock at the northern part of Rocquaine bay, near Lihou island. Pleinmont guard-house is on the heights southward of the bay near the bluff. Torteval church, with its round tower surmounted by a high steeple, stands at a little distance inland and is as conspicuous in this part of the island as Catel and Vale churches are in the northern part.f As the coast is approached, the northern part of the island sloping gradually northward from the high southern plateau begins to rise above the horizon, presenting a surface diversified with houses, churches, windmills, and groups of trees, all of which become still more conspicuous if seen from a north-westerly direction. * See Admiralty charts :\u2014 Channel islands, No. 2,669 a, b ; scale m = 0'5 inch ; and Guernsey, Serk, and Herm islands, 3 sheets, No. 262 a, b, c, with Views ; scale m = t'O inches.

VI.] GENERAL DESCRIPTION.\u2014 APPROACH. 269 The western shore of Guernsey is studded with precipitous rocks, of which many are wholly detached from the land. On the high land above St. Martin's point at the south-eastern end of the island is a stone column, erected in honour of Lieut-General Sir John Doyle ; it is 96 feet high, with its summit 424 feet above the level of low water. Another remarkable object is the Victoria tower, 100 feet high and 322 feet above low water, erected on the heights above St. Peter Port to commemorate the visit of Her Majesty the Queen in 1846. It is a square tower, slightly tapering from its base, sur mounted by a battlemented gallery, with square turrets at its angles. The island of Guernsey is nearly in the form of a right-angled triangle, the north-western side forming the hypothenuse, the length of which is about 8 miles. The land on the southern side is high and steep, its general elevation being about 300 feet ; the highest part is Hautnez, over Icart bay, which is 363 feet above the level of low water, but it gradually lowers towards the North, where, in some places, it is little above the sea level. The island is encompassed by many dangerous rocks, of which the principal are the Hanois, Sambule, and Grunes, on the western and north-western sides ; the Braye rocks with several others on the northern side ; and, on the north-eastern and eastern sides lie the Amfroque rocks, together with the islands of Herm and Jethou, which are also themselves surrounded by numerous rocks and ledges. Guernsey contains 16,000 acres of land, which is fertile and highly cultivated ; its population in 1881 was 32,379, and it does not grow grain enough, nor raise a sufficient number of cattle to supply its inhabitants. Approach from the Westward.\u2014 Vessels bound to Guernsey from the westward should not approach the island in thick weather within a depth of 40 or 38 fathoms, unless their position has been well ascertained previously. Careful allowance should also be made for the flood stream setting in towards the island. The water is deep 2 cables westward of Hanois lighthouse, see page 275 ; but,from it, dangerous rocks extend S.S.W. 3^ cables, N.N.W. 1\\ cables, and North one mile. The Grune de l'Ouest, or du Nord-Ouest, a rock which dries 10 feet at low water, springs, and which was formerly considered the northernmost danger off Guernsey, bears N.E. \\ E. nearly 5 miles from Hanois lighthouse ; but, as several sunken rocks on which the sea breaks heavily in bad weather have been discovered outside it, of which the Boue Blondel, the most western, has only 5\u00a3 fathoms water and bears from the lighthouse"], [292, "[Chap. VI. 270 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 GUERNSEY. N. by E. | E. 3^ miles, it is recommended that, to clear all these dangers, vessels from the South or West passing westward of Guernsey at night, should not bring Hanois light westward of South until the Casquets light bears E.N.E. Anchorages. \u2014 Rocquaine and Perelle bays, on the western coast of Guernsey, are so surrounded by rocks as to be unsafe of approach for any but the smallest vessels ; there are, however, several anchorages on the southern side, especially at Icart and Petit Port bays, where, with the wind off the land, a vessel may stop for a tide ; but even they are not safe for a stranger to approach, and no vessel without a pilot should close the southern coast so as to shut in the North point of Serk with Jerbourg bluff. St. Peter Port road, on the eastern side of the island, affords good shelter except with the wind between S.W. by S. and S.E., and the holding ground is excellent. There is also good anchorage at the northern end of the Great bank, on the eastern side of the island, as well as on the northern coast off Fort Doyle, and in Ancresse, Grand Havre, Cobo and Vazon bays ; but, at most of these places it is necessary to employ a pilot. Pilotage. \u2014 By ordinance of the Royal Court of Guernsey it is enacted, that every pilot boat shall carry a flag, half red and half white, the white part uppermost ; the letter P shall be marked in black on the white part, and the pilot's number in white on the red part near the centre of the flag ; the whole under penalty of a fine, at the discretion of the court. And, that every ship or vessel of above 50 tons burthen, new admeasurement, shall be bound to take a pilot, both on her arrival in this island and on her departure, on pain of paying the usual pilotage to the pilot who shall first have presented himself for the purpose of undertaking the conduct or pilotage thereof. Steam-vessels and yachts are excepted, also ships or vessels putting into the roads in consequence of stress of weather or contrary winds and putting to sea again, provided they do not load or unload merchandise or ballast. In case a pilot is prevented by tempestuous weather from getting on board a ship or vessel at sea such ship or vessel and the pilot boat shall so manage as to enable the pilot boat to take the lead and serve as a guide, and such ship or vessel shall pay the same pilotage as if the pilot had actually gone on board."], [293, "Chap. VI.] GENERAL INFORMATION.\u2014 TIDAL STREAMS, 271 Rates of Pilotage. Beacons. \u2014 When beacons marking rocks in the vicinity of Guernsey require renewing, it is the intention of the Government that, as far as possible, each beacon shall be capped with the initial letter of the name of the rock on which it stands. The carrying out of this principle has been commenced ; thus, for instance, the Vermerette beacon in the Passe Percee instead of bearing a triangle as formerly, is now surmounted by the letter V in white. Tidal Streams.* \u2014 The eastern or flood stream makes close in-shore soon after low water along the southern and north-western coasts of Guernsey, whilst the south-western stream is still running at its strength in the offing 4 miles westward of the island ; between these positions the streams vary in strength and direction as one or the other is approached. The flood stream between Guernsey and the rocks projecting from the south-western end of Jethou island takes two different direc tions ; one part runs directly through the Great road and Little Russell channel ; the other branches off nearly at right angles and runs eastward towards Jethou, passing through the before-mentioned rocks and into the Great Russell. The ebb stream takes exactly the reverse direction, the stream from the Great Russell, after having passed through the rocks of Jethou, uniting with that through the road, and both setting south-westward. With Grande Braye rock a boat's length open westward of Brehon tower, a vessel keeps in the stream which sets through the road and Little Russell, but the Grande Braye on with Brehon tower places her in the indraught of the Great Russell.

It is high water in the Great and Little Russell channels at the same time as at St. Peter Port, viz., at 6 h. 37 m., full and change, the last half of the falling and the first half of the rising tide occurring with the south-western stream ; and, the last half of the rising and first half of the falling tide with the north-eastern stream. In other words, at low water by the shore at St. Peter Port the south-western stream has been running nearly 3 hours and is at its strength, and at high water by the shore the north-eastern stream has been running nearly 3 hours and is also at its full strength. Thus, off the eastern end of the island, the streams turn at about half tide by the shore and run nearly 5^ hours each way, allowing something more than a quarter of an hour for the slack at each change of stream. In the Great Russell, the strength of the north-eastern stream runs E.N.E. and of the south-western stream W.S.W. ; and, in the Little Russell the direction of the two streams at their greatest strength is N.E. \\ E. and S.W. \\ W. nearly. At the north-eastern entrance of the Little Russell, however, between the Braye and Amfroque rocks, the stream takes the direction of that in the offing, viz., the first two hours of the flood directly for the northern end of Herm island, gradually joining the south-western stream through the Russell, and the last hour of the flood as well as the first of the ebb joining the north-eastern stream. To understand the various sets of the tides in the Russell channels, and round the outer shores of this group of islands, it is necessary to consider their governing cause, viz., the rotary change of direct ion in the offing stream, which in one tide runs in regular succession from every point of the compass. At high water by the shore, as just shown, the stream is setting E.N.E. fairly through the Russell channels, and is then at its greatest strength, coinciding nearly with the general direction of the offing stream, which, at this time, westward of Guernsey is running E. by N., and eastward of Serk N.N.E. Three hours after high water, or at half ebb, the direction of the offing stream in its progressive change from North to West, &c, is setting about N.W. by N., which a glance at the chart will show to be right across the northern entrance of the Russell channels, producing, as might be expected, a slack tide in the Great Russell under the lee of Serk, and still more so in the Little Russell, protected as it is by Herm, Jethou, and the numerous rocks northward and southward of those islands. At low water the offing stream has got round to W.S.W.,"], [295, "Chap, vi.] 273 TIDAL STREAMS. and as this is about the direction of the Russell channels, the south western stream at this time attains its greatest strength. After low water, the island of Guernsey appears to obstruct some what the free course of the main stream into the channels eastward of it ; and, at half flood, partly owing to this obstruction and partly to the rising waters at the northern and southern ends of the island being pretty evenly balanced, and notwithstanding the strong easterly stream along its northern and southern shores, slack water prevails throughout the whole extent of the Russell channels. The rising tide on the southern side gradually prevailing, forces the flood or north-eastern stream through these channels, attaining its greatest strength, as before stated, near high water. Consideration of the foregoing general remarks is necessary in order to understand the great diversity in the set of streams and eddies about these islands. It must be also remembered that a body of water once set in motion continues to move onward for some time after the removal of the originating force ; thus, the Russell streams continue to run south-westward for some time after the source of supply has been cut off, and until the greater and more rapid rise of tide southward of Guernsey causes a reversal of the stream. The south-westerly streams, when they meet the first of the eastern stream off St. Martin's point, blend with it and make a south-eastern stream which, at springs, runs with considerable strength from the northern end of the Great bank south-eastward for some distance outside the Tetes d'Aval, but is not felt inside the Great bank, nor near St. Martin's point. The value of a thorough knowledge of the tides may be illustrated by following the track of a Guernsey boatman on a trip to the eastern side of Serk and back. He will take a fair tide the whole distance. Leaving Guernsey road a little after low water, he proceeds with a fair tide to the S.E., outside the Tetes d'Aval until he meets the eastern stream, with which he sails southward of Serk. Near l'Etac de Serk he runs into a northerly stream, which accompanies him along the eastern side of the island as far as Le Creux. On his return to Guernsey he will round the northern point of Serk about an hour after high water, at which time the turning of the offing stream towards the North removes the pressure of the Great Russell stream from the Bee du Nez and causes an eddy from it to the Givaude rock off Brecqhou, and he will carry an eddy or counter stream as far as the Givaude rock, outside of which he will meet the true stream setting north-westward at 2 hours after high water. Going with this stream, he will pass through the Passe Percee, and, crossing the Little A. 2771. Wt. 17197. S"], [296, "[Chap. VI. 274 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 GUERNSEY. Russell, arrive at St. Peter Port before the south-western stream has fairly made. Close to the coasts of the Channel islands, as well as in the offing outside them, the general drift of the tidal stream appears to corre spond with its rotary motion from right to left ; for, it has frequently happened that floating objects near the shore have been seen succes sively on their northern, western, southern, and eastern coasts. Moreover, part of a wrecked vessel having drifted from a rock near the Casquets during calm weather was known to take a south-westerly course, and to drift with a rotary motion through a succession of parabolic tidal curves at the rate of about 4 miles per day, round the western and southern coasts of Guernsey, several miles distant from the island, and up the Deroute and Race streams ; whilst other parts of the same wreck, having probably drifted off the rock at the com mencement of the western stream, and having therefore . been set farther out westward, were met with about the same time several miles within and eastward of the Roches-Douvres. Such examples prove the existence of a drift which coincides with the shifting movement of the tidal stream ; south-westerly from the Casquets, southerly past Guernsey, easterly and southerly between Guernsey and the Roches-Douvres, and northerly when eastward of the islands. The easterly and main branch of this drift, as already noticed, passes up the Deroute and Race channels, and it seems highly probable that after clearing the Race of Alderney it turns off west ward past that island, reunites with its own stream again off the Casquets, and repeats the same round as before in endless succession. This drift, commonly known as the \" indraught of the gulf of St. Malo,\" was formerly supposed to exist only during fresh westerly breezes, and doubtless its strength is greatly increased at such times, but there is now no doubt that between the Casquets and the Roches- Douvres it is continuous, and with a rate proportioned to the strength of the tidal stream. These facts serve to show that vessels going round the islands, as well as those navigating the channels between them, may occasionally shorten their passages materially by following the curves of the tidal streams instead of taking direct courses. Caution. \u2014 Although the north-eastern stream begins to set through the Little Russell at the same time as through the Great Russell,viz.,at half tide,it has no northern inclination round St.Martin's point until 4 hours flood ; care must be taken therefore that the first"], [297, "Chap.

HANOIS LIGHT.\u2014 The light tower on the Bise rock, the south western rock of the Hanois group, one mile off the western end of Guernsey, exhibits, at 100 feet above high water, a revolving red light of the first order, which attains its greatest brilliancy every forty-five seconds, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 12 miles all round the horizon except when obscured by the island of Guernsey between the bearings W. by S. \u00a3 S. and N.W. \\ W. ; the line of eclipse in this latter direction passes 3\u00a7 miles south-westward of l'Etac de Serk, and over the Pierres de Lecq rocks off the northern coast of Jersey. The light tower is of gray granite and 117 feet high from base to vane ; from it, the Casquets lighthouse bears N.

The rocks and shoals of the Hanois group, referred to at page 269, are more particularly included and described under the head of \" Rocquaine bay,\" in the following pages ; a brief description of the outer dangers in approaching the north-western coast of Guernsey being first given. OUTER DANGERS Off the N.W. COAST.\u2014 The north- western side of Guernsey should not be approached nearer than 3^ miles, several dangerous rocky ledges lying off it, of which those most to be feared are the Grande Etacre, Sambule, Soufleuresse and Boin, and the Grunes de l'Ouest or du Nord-Ouest. The Grande Etacre dries 19 feet at low water, springs ; the Sambule 16 feet ; the Soufleuresse 10 feet ; the Boin 3 feet ; and, the Grimes de l'Ouest 10 feet. From the outer head of the Grune de l'Ouest, which is 2 miles from the island shore, and on which it is proposed to erect a beacon, Catel spire just open eastward of Guet du Catel bears S.S.E. southerly ; and, Hanois lighthouse on with the rock off the western end of Lihou island, next within Corner rock, S.W. \\ W. 5 miles nearly.

As before described, several dangerous sunken rocks on which the sea breaks heavily in bad weather, lie considerably outside these dangers. Of these the principal are, the Boue Blondel of 5\u00a3 fathoms water, from which Hanois lighthouse bears S. by W. f W. 3^ miles ; and, Torteval spire over the western part of Lihou island S. by E., distant 2\u00a3 miles from the latter. The inner head of the Roques aux Bois of 5| fathoms, with Catel church, the Guet du Catel, and the outer and highest head of the Grunes de l'Ouest in line S.S.E. easterly three quarters of a mile outside the latter. The outer head of the Frettes of 5^ fathoms, with Catel church just open eastward of Grande Roque tower, South, 2f miles from the tower. The Platte Pierre half way between the Boue Blondel and the inner head of the Roques aux Bois, although with 11 fathoms water, also breaks heavily. Hanois lighthouse open westward of the Pendante, the outer rock of the Trois Peres group, S.W.

Unless a vessel is quite under command and in charge of a pilot, she should not approach these rocks nearer than 2 miles. ROCQUAINE BAY, between Lihou island on the North and the Grosse rock on the South, is H miles wide ; it is fronted by numerous groups of rocks as well as by isolated ones, of which many are always above water ; a far greater number uncover with the falling tide, and those which never uncover are still more numerous. The anchorage in this bay is well sheltered from northerly, easterly, and southerly winds ; but, westerly winds send in such a heavy sea, especially between half flood and half ebb, that a sailing vessel caught in the bay under such circumstances could not possibly get out. The holding ground, consisting generally of fine gravel and sand covered with grass and sea-weed, is not good. It is only frequented by fishermen of the neighbourhood, or occasionally by vessels calculated to take the beach ; nevertheless, at the anchorage in the south-western part of the bay off Pezerie point, a vessel of not more than 12 or 13 feet draught, well moored, would ride securely all the year round under any circumstances of wind and weather."], [299, "Chap.

TroiS P6\"res bank is the largest and most conspicuous rocky group in the northern part of Rocquaine bay ; the Pendante, its outer rock, is 50 feet above low water and bears W. \\ S. one mile from Lihou lower house. The other Trois Peres rocks are about the same height, but nearly a cable within the Pendante. Rocks of nearly the same height are also on the eastern front of this reef. A 15-feet passage exists between the Trois Peres bank and Lihou island, for which the leading mark is, Torteval spire on with the north-eastern side of Fort Grey ; but, neither this nor any other passage into Rocquaine bay should be attempted without a pilot, unless under most urgent circumstances. Hanois bank, from h\\ to 8 cables westward of the Pendante rock, extends in a N.W. \\ N. and S.E. \\ S. direction for about half a mile, and the Haut Fourquie, the highest rock, is on its inner part and dries 10 feet ; two other rocks dry 5 feet near its outer extreme.

E. easterly, and run in until abreast of the Percee rock, when Black rock will come on with a remarkable rock on Lihou saddle ; this mark leads -to a good anchorage in 4 fathoms a little beyond the Nipple rock. To anchor off the Torquetil rock in 2^ fathoms, quit the leading mark just given when Cacquerau house is on with the northern side of the Torquetil E. N., and steer in with this mark until Fort Grey comes on with Braye rock, when Cacquerau house must be opened a little northward of the Torquetil to clear a 4-f eet rock ; after passing which, anchor as convenient. The mark for entering the inner anchorage off Pezerie point is Apex house, southward of Caudre mill, on with the northern tangent of Fort Grey ; but, on account of the narrowness of the channel, no stranger should attempt to approach this anchorage except in the hands of a skilful pilot. The leading mark between Lihou island and the Trois Peres bank, already given, Torteval spire on with the north-eastern corner of Fort Grey S. by E. f E., leads safely as far as the Fourquie, a rock which dries 17 feet and must be passed very closely on the port hand, after which rocks are numerous and the chart is the best guide. A vessel may pass safely between the Hanois bank and the Aiguillons by bringing Torteval church on with the south-western side of Round rock S.E. \\ E. ; and, after passing the Aiguillons, she may open Torteval church a little south-westward of Round rock, and after passing it, enter Rocquaine bay by the leading marks already given from the southward. There is no ship channel into Rocquaine bay between the Trois Peres and the Hanois bank.

ICART and PETIT PORT BAYS, on the southern side of Guernsey, afford good anchorage and shelter during easterly or northerly winds. Petit port being the largest and easiest of access, is by far the best of the two ; the ground is clean fine white sand, and any depth from 5 to 9 fathoms may be chosen, but a sailing vessel at anchor here should be in readiness to put to sea im mediately a shift of wind renders it necessary. The only danger in entering Petit Port bay is the Bane du Petit Port, with 12 feet water. It lies W. f S. 2^ cables from Jerbourg point ; to clear it in entering from the eastward, do not shut in the Goubiniere rock with St. Martin's point until Doyle's column opens westward of a remarkably high rocky bluff on the eastern side of the sandy bay under it. Doyle's column on with the peak of the rocky bluff N.E. by E. \\ E. easterly is the leading mark in. The Mouilliere, a dangerous rock with only 4 feet over it at high water, springs, lies nearly in the centre of the bay, with Doyle's column just inside the inner end of the cliffs on the eastern side of the sandy beach under it bearing E. by N. \\ N., and Jerbourg point S.S.E. \\ E. one third of a mile. In entering Icart bay, the Balleine rock, awash at low water, 2^ cables south-westward of Icart point, as well as the Rousse rock which dries 20 feet one cable southward of La Moye point, must be avoided. In the centre of the bay is the Fourquie de la Moye which dries 8 feet, and, near the western shore, the Vieux Poulain"], [302, "[Chap. VI. 280 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014GUERNSEY. which dries 23 feet. The anchorage is between, but in-shore of, these rocks in about 7 fathoms, sand. DANGERS off the EAST COAST.\u2014 The dangers to be avoided in rounding St. Martin's point, the south-eastern extreme of Guernsey, are the Grunes de Jerbourg, the Longue Pierre, Gabrielle, Piette, and Anfre rocks, as well as the shoal part of the Great bank. Grunes de Jerbourg are a dangerous cluster of rocks extend ing 2\\ cables in a S.S.E. direction from Jerbourg point, their outer extreme bearing about S. W. \\ W. from St. Martin's point ; they cover at the first quarter flood, and have 26 fathoms close to their southern side. The Longue Pierre dries 19 feet at low water, springs ; it is \\\\ cables eastward from St. Martin's point, and is marked by a black staff and skeleton ball beacon, with the letters L P below the ball. The Gabrielle Rock dries 4 feet at low water, at which time there are 23 feet on the southern end, 19 feet on the middle, and 17 feet on the northern part of the Great bank ; the Gabrielle is 2 cables off-shore eastward of the Bee du Nez, 4| cables N. by E. easterly from the Longue Pierre beacon and lies half a cable in-shore of the line of bearing of the Ans re and Longue Pierre beacons ; from it, Saumarez monument is just shut in with the north-eastern angle of Castle Cornet. The Anfre Rock, marked by a pole beacon surmounted by the letter A, dries 8 feet and bears N. by E. f E. from the Longue Pierre beacon, distant rather more than a mile from it, and 3^ cables from the shore. The Piette is an 18-feet patch about a cable S.S.E. of the Anfre. The Great Bank lies nearly parallel with the eastern shore, its south-western edge being 6 cables distant from the Bee du Nez, and its north-western edge 1\\ cables distant from Castle Cornet break water lighthouse. Within the 5-fathoms line, it is nearly 1^ miles long and 2 cables wide, and has a general depth of from 21 to 27 feet ; there is a shoal patch of 18 feet near the centre, but the shoalest part is near the northern end. From its southern limit, St. Peter Port church is on with the Anfre beacon ; and, from its northern limit, the northern angle of Castle Cornet, the old harbour lighthouse, and Elizabeth college tower are in one. The shoalest part, of 17 feet near the northern end, is 2 cables southward of this latter line of"], [303, "Chap. VI.] DANGERS OFF EAST COAST. \u2014 ST. PETER PORT. 281 direction, and, from it, St. Peter Port church is just open of the southern angle of Castle Cornet. The Anfre beacon and the white stone conical beacon on the top of Fermain point in line, lead north ward of it and across the northern end of the bank in 20 feet. Clearing Marks. \u2014 To pass eastward of the rocks described and westward of the shoal part of the Great Bank, keep Saumarez monu ment on with, or a little open eastward of, the end of Castle Cornet breakwater N. by E. \\ E. ; this mark also leads close outside the Piette and Anfre rock beacon, and between the Ferico and Oyster rocks up to the Tremies. The last-named rocks, lying in the vicinity of Castle Cornet, as well as the Moulinet to the South-west, which is marked by a beacon, consisting of a pole surmounted by a barrel and a bird with the letter M beneath the barrel, must be carefully avoided when running for St. Peter Port road ; the Tremies is north-eastward of the Castle, and South nearly half a cable from the breakwater lighthouse ; the Oyster rock, which dries 12 feet, lies nearly a cable south-eastward of Castle Cornet. The Ferico, the most dangerous of these rocks, with only 9 feet water, lies 1^ cables eastward of the Castle, and in the fairway of vessels bound to St. Peter Port from the southward. To pass east ward of it, keep St. Martin's barracks open eastward of the Anfre beacon until Salerie point is open of Castle Cornet breakwater end, or bring Castle Cornet breakwater lighthouse to bear N.N.W. when nearing it, which bearing also clears the Forien rock, of 38 feet water, a cable outside the Ferico. ST. PETER PORT, the capital of Guernsey, stands on the eastern shore of the island, and, in 1881, its population numbered 16,658. From the sea, it has rather an imposing appearance, but it is irregularly built. It is the seat of government of the northern division (or Bailiwick, as it is termed) of the Channel islands, which includes Alderney, Serk, Herm, and Jethou. Its old tidal harbour, carrying a depth of 20 feet alongside the quays at high water, springs, and 10 feet at neaps, is enclosed by the new harbour, formed between two breakwaters, with a depth in its outer part of 10 feet at low water, springs. The principal articles of export are cider, apples, potatoes, grapes and other fruits, building stone, and granite in a broken state for the repair of roads. The imports are British manufactures, coal, wine, sugar, coffee, and other provisions, grain, and cattle \u2014 the two latter"], [304, "[Chap. VI. 282 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 GUERNSEY. chiefly from France. In the year 1862 the number of vessels belonging to the port was 128, their total registered tonnage 19,679 tons, and they were manned by 1,053 seamen. In the year 1886, including the little port of St. Sampson's, 2,172 vessels, of an aggregate tonnage of 363,220 tons, entered the port. There are two patent slips, but no dock accommodation, and no appliances for the repair of iron ships or machinery; moderate repairs on wooden vessels up to about 400 tons can be effected. Communication. \u2014 St. Peter Port is in telegraphic communication with England by cable from its north-eastern point to Dartmouth, and with France through Jersey, also with Alderney by cable from Ancresse bay ; it is in daily communication by steamer with Southampton and Jersey all the year round, and with Weymouth daily in summer, but bi-weekly in winter ; with London, Plymouth, Cher bourg, and St. Brieuc weekly ; with Bristol and Morlaix periodically ; with Alderney bi-weekly ; and, with Serk, thrice a week regularly, and almost daily in summer. There is no railway in the island. Supplies. \u2014 Coal in small quantities can be obtained at St. Peter Port, the stock in hand averaging about 200 tons, and the price from about 11. to 11 2s. 6d. per ton. Vessels coal alongside the wharf in 11 feet at low water, springs. The only accessible watering place for vessels formerly was at Fermain bay, about a mile northward of St. Martin's point, where, with the wind from N.N.E. round by West to S.W., boats with long hoses may fill at pleasure almost any quantity ; but pipes are now laid from the large reservoir at Havelet to the harbours, where water is now supplied at a shilling a ton. St. Peter Port market furnishes fresh meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit in abundance at a cheap rate. Harbours. \u2014 The old tidal harbour of St. Peter Port, 4| acres in area, is enclosed by piers of masonry 25 feet high, with an entrance 80 feet wide facing the East. On the southern pier-head is a white wooden lighthouse 20 feet in height. The depth at high water springs, between the pier-heads is 24| feet, and 14| feet at neaps ; the average depth along the quays on the same tides being respectively 20 and 10 feet. South-eastward of the old harbour stands Castle Cornet, connected with the mainland by a massive granite causeway and wooden viaduct. The new harbour works comprise two esplanades, one on each side of the old harbour, running parallel with the sea front of the town, and averaging together 2,500 feet in length and 150 feet in breadth. From the extremes of these esplanades extend two break-"], [305, "Chap, vi.] 283 ST. PETER PORT. waters, one on either side and equi-distant from the old harbour ; being 2,500 feet apart at the base and projecting eastward so as to enclose the natural sandy bay in front of the town, the whole space of both harbours thus enclosed being about 73 acres, of which all but about 23 acres dries at low water, springs. The South or Castle breakwater is carried across the rocky isthmus, by which, at low water, Castle Cornet is connected with the main, and terminates at the north-western bastion of the Castle, being 1,900 feet in length. The southern face of this break water consists of an upright wall and parapet of rough masonry 15 feet above the level of the highest tides, and along it is a level road way and footpath 120 feet wide. On the northern side and under the lee of this arm it is proposed to construct a wet dock or basin ; a boat camber is also to be constructed. From the north-eastern angle of Castle Cornet outwards, a rough stone breakwater projects 600 feet farther eastward, its end marked by a circular granite light house 40 feet high from base to vane. These works effectually screen the entrance of the harbour from the most exposed quarter, the southward, and add greatly to the security of the anchorage in the road. The North or St. Jullien's breakwater and landing pier begins northward of the old harbour, at the end of the esplanade, and extends in an easterly direction about 1,400 feet as far as the head of the Blanche rock, from whence it takes a southerly direction, a little outside the line of Castle Cornet, for nearly 900 feet, leaving an entrance between the pier-end and the rocks off Castle Cornet of 370 feet in width, and completely sheltering the pool within. This pier has three capital landing stages for steamers along the inner side of its outer part, having 9, 8, and 3 feet respectively at the lowest spring tides, at which time there are 10 feet at the entrance near the pier-head, and 6 feet near the middle of the pool, from whence the water shoals gradually and regularly towards the shore. The bottom of the harbour is almost entirely of fine sand, except on the southern side, where is a rocky ledge marked on its edge by two buoys, one red, the other black.* A Life-boat is stationed at St. Peter Port. * The depths as well as heights, &c, appearing in this Chapter and in the Admiralty chart of Guernsey, are reckoned from a zero of low water, mean springs. The lowest tide registered at Guernsey from 1858 to 1868 fell 3 feet 9 inches below that zero. On February 10th 1887, the lowest tide on record took place, the tide falling 1 feet si inches below the zero and the range of the same tide being 33 feet 6 inches. The least range of tide recorded in Guernsey is 6 feet ; it took place both on the 7th April and 16th September 1858."], [306, "284 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 GUERNSEY. [Chap. VI. ST. PETER PORT ROAD fronts the town north-eastward of Castle Cornet. The holding ground is excellent, and the road affords good shelter against all winds, except those from between S.W. by S. and S.E., which send in much swell and sea, especially on the ebb tide, rendering this anchorage then unsafe. Under such circumstances, smoother water may probably be found under the lee of the Great bank, where a vessel will be much safer than in the road, as, in the event of parting, she may run through the Little Russell and anchor off Fort Doyle or in Ancresse bay. A vessel should, if possible, lie at single anchor in St. Peter Port road, always keeping a second anchor ready ; but, if compelled to moor, the anchors should be laid in the direction of the stream. The best anchorage is within the folloAving limits : \u2014 Southern limit, St. Peter Port church on with Castle Cornet breakwater end ; northern limit, Sardrette rock beacon and Victoria tower in line ; western limit, the outer angle of Castle Cornet on with the white beacon on Fermain point ; eastern limit, the Anfre beacon on with the eastern extreme of St. Martin's barracks. Within this space, there are from 5 to 11 fathoms, fine sand ; farther southward, the bottom is coarse and the depth increases to 20 fathoms. There is a government 2\u00a3 inch mooring chain laid down in 5 fathoms, about 2 cables north-eastward of Castle Cornet breakwater lighthouse, and, within the harbour, are several small mooring and warping buoys. Tides.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Peter Port at 6 h. 37 m. ; equinoctial springs rise 33 feet, ordinary springs 26 feet, neaps 18f feet ; neaps range 111 feet. The general level of the sea is liable to be depressed or raised 2 or 3 feet, or even more, by strong easterly or westerly winds. See note page 283. LIGHTS.\u2014 On the outer end of Castle Cornet breakwater, at the southern side of the entrance to the outer harbour, is a fixed white light 46 feet above high water, and visible 9 miles. It shows as a bright light from North round by East to South, and as a dim light landward, from South round by West to North. From the light house, the Longue Pierre rock beacon bears S. by W. f W. nearly 2 miles ; Tetes d'Aval rocks buoy S.E. by S. 2\\ miles ; Rousse rock E.N.E. 2\\ miles ; Platte rock N.E. f E. 2\\ miles ; and, the Roustel rock black buoy N.E. by E. \\ E. easterly 2\\ miles. On the outer end of the northern, St. Jullien's, breakwater is exhibited a faint green light. On the southern pier-head of the old harbour is exhibited a red fixed light, visible 3 miles ; it is 34 feet above high water and may"], [307, "Chap. VI.] ST. PETER PORT ROAD. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 285 be seen from the Russell channels, and also from the southward when St. Martin's point is rounded. When bearing W. by N. a N. it leads into the harbour. Northward of St. Peter Port, the eastern shore of the island is fronted by rocks and ledges and is very foul ; the outer and most important of these dangers are included in the description of the Little Russell channel ; see pages 295-298. Within 1^ cables of the elbow of the St. Jullien breakwater, are three rocks marked by beacons. The Sardrette marked by a pole surmounted by a barrel, dries 19 feet, and borders the roadstead ; the Goubeau rock, marked by a black cone beacon surmounted by a pole and cross, striped black and white, is less than a cable northward of the Sardrette ; and, the Roche-a-deux-Tetes, with a black beacon, lies one cable in-shore of the Goubeau. Directions. \u2014 A vessel from the westward bound to St. Peter Port or to the anchorage off the eastern side of Guernsey, and intending to pass southward of the island, should, as before stated, make careful allowance for the flood stream, if it be running, as it sets in towards the land. Rounding Pleinmont point, give the light house on the Hanois rocks a berth of at least 1^ miles, to avoid the Hanois and Bise banks ; and, to clear the Hanois rocks, keep Corbiere point or La Moye point well open of Pleinmont point and of the Tas de Pois d'Aval rock S.E. by E. f E. To clear Pleinmont ledge and all dangers between it and La Moye point, do not shut in Lihou island with Pleinmont point until Serk church, which stands northward of the mill, is open of Jerbourg point. When abreast of La Moye point, open the northern point of Serk southward of Jerbourg point, or keep Pleinmont bluff open of Corbiere point, to avoid the Balleine rock, awash at low water, W.S.W. 2\\ cables from Icart point. After passing this point, keep Sommeilleuse guard-house, a ruin standing on the edge of a high and remarkable cliff a short distance eastward of La Moye point, open southward of Icart low point until Brehon tower opens east ward of the Longue Pierre beacon, or until the ruin of Herm mill touches the northern side of the high land of Jethou ; these marks lead outside the Grunes de Jerbourg. Rounding St. Martin's point, Saumarez monument on with the end of Castle Cornet breakwater N. by E. \\ E. is the leading mark between the Anfre rock and Great bank, keeping St. Martin's barracks open southward of the Anfre beacon until Salerie battery opens of Castle Cornet breakwater, or until the breakwater lighthouse"], [308, "286 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 GUERNSEY. bears N.N.W. When the town church comes open of the breakwater, anchor in the road as convenient, or run into the harbour if the tide serves. To pass eastward of the Great bank, keep Vale mill about midway between Mont Crevelt tower and Vale castle, and touching the eastern end of the breakwater of St. Sampson harbour, N. \\ E. ; and, when the town church is shut in behind Castle Cornet, haul in for the anchorage. At night, when running for this anchorage from the north-east ward, through the Great Russell, see page 299, steer south-westward until the red light on the South pier-head of St. Peter Port old harbour well open southward of Castle Cornet bears N.W. by N., which mark leads southward of the Tetes d'Aval and over the northern part of the Great bank in from 21 to 25 feet water. On nearing the castle and running for the harbour, bring the red light open northward of the white light on Castle Cornet breakwater, and, with the red light bearing W. by N \\ N., anchor in the road or run on into harbour. The red light touching the southern part of Castle Cornet leads between the Tetes d'Aval and the buoy marking them, and only 150 feet southward of the rocks, and across the Great bank in 21 feet water. Steering for the Little Russell, see page 295, from the northward, keep the Casquets light on a N.E. by N. bearing until Castle Cornet breakwater light bears S.W. by W. \\ W., this being the line of bearing for the central track. This passage, however, should never be attempted at night by a stranger, nor even by a person acquainted with the place, unless in a steam-vessel of light draught or at near high water. From the westward and southward by night, after passing St. Martin's point, steer to the eastward until the old harbour red light is seen clear of Terres point bearing North ; kept in sight on this line, it leads a quarter of a mile eastward of the Longue Pierre beacon. When St. Martin's point bears S.W \\ W., steer N.E. by N. to pass between the Anfre rock and the Great Bank ; and, when Castle Cornet breakwater white light bears N.N.W., steer N. by E. until the red light bears W. by N. \\ N., after which proceed as before directed. ST. SAMPSON'S HARBOUR is on the eastern side of Guernsey, 1^ miles northward of St. Peter Port, between Vale Castle and Mont Crevelt, and is dry at low water. The site now forming this harbour was originally the eastern entrance to an arm of the sea which severed the northern portion of Guernsey from the main island. About the"], [309, "Chap. VI.] ST. SAMPSON AND BORDEAUX HARBOURS. 287 beginning of this century the strait was embanked at each end, and since then the intervening land has been reclaimed. The harbour is rectangular in form ; its extreme length being about 1,900 feet N.W. and S.E. with an average width of 500 feet, and containing a water area of 22 acres at high water, springs. At low water, springs, this space is dry, and the tide ebbs for a considerable distance outside the pier-heads. The entrance between the pier-heads is 120 feet wide, and the depth at high water, ordinary neaps, 15 feet. At this time there are 12 feet along the southern pier, and 11 feet for a length of 150 feet along the South quay, from which spot it gradually shoals to its western end. There are two small patent slips in this harbour. A rocky patch, with 10 feet water, lies near the centre of the channel leading to St. Sampson's harbour ; from this patch, the Grunette beacon, representing the figure of a man, is just touching the southern side of Mont Crevelt battery ; and, St. Peter Port church is just open eastward of the Vivian rock beacon, painted with black and white rings. Directions. \u2014 The approach to this harbour is difficult, being athwart the tidal streams, and having the Crabiere, Grunette, Grande Demie, and other rocks off the entrance. The most dangerous of these is the Crabiere, in the fairway of the entrance, and distant about 200 yards from the head of Mont Crevelt breakwater ; it has, however, been reduced in height, having now 9 feet on it at half tide. The best entrance to the harbour is between the Crabiere and the Grunette beacon ; this passage, however, is not above half a cable wide, and the leading mark is, the Grunette beacon on with the southern tangent of the breakwater until close up to the beacon, when pass 50 yards northward of it and steer in between the pier heads. The bottom is blue clay covered with a layer of sand. A Life-Boat is stationed at St. Sampson's harbour. Bordeaux Harbour, half a mile northward of St. Sampson, is quite insignificant and used only by fishermen. Here small craft lie aground, but, as the entrance only admits vessels of about 10 tons, a further description is needless. One mile northward of Bordeaux harbour is Doyle fort, standing on the north-eastern point of Guernsey, off which lie the Brayes, Platte Fougere, and other rocks included in the description of the Little Russell channel, see pages 295-298 ; between these rocks and the shore is the narrow channel named Doyle's Pass, see page 298."], [310, "[Chap. VI. 288 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 GUERNSEY. Half a mile westward of Doyle's fort is Ancresse bay, and, westward of it, the land trends in a W. f S. direction about 6 miles to Lihou island. The shore end of the telegraph cable connecting with Dartmouth is landed near Doyle's fort. ANCRESSE BAY, on the northern side of Guernsey, west ward of Fort Le Marchant, affords good shelter for small craft during south-easterly, southerly, and westerly winds, in from 6 to 2 fathoms water. Victoria tower on with No. 6 martello tower, near the middle of the bay, S.S.W. \u00a7 W. leads up to the anchorage. The bottom is muddy sand, and excellent holding ground. The telegraph cable from Alderney is landed here. GRAND HAVRE, 8 cables westward of Ancresse bay, has its entrance between Mont Guet on the North and Rousse point on the South, on both of which points are martello towers ; Vale church is near the shore at the head of the Havre. It affords excellent anchorage for small vessels in from 14 to 9 feet water, the bottom of sand and grass, with good shelter against southerly and easterly winds ; north-westerly winds, however, send in a heavy swell and sea between half flood and half ebb, though, with good ground gear, little danger is to be apprehended. For vessels capable of taking the ground, there is a safe place on the south-eastern side of Rousse point. The Rousse de Mer, a dangerous rock which uncovers at a quarter ebb, lies in the fairway of the entrance, and on each side of it are many more rocks. From the Rousse de Mer, Saumarez monument just shut in with the south-western angle of Vale church bears S. by E. \\ E. ; and, the watch-house on the highest part of Lihou island on with the highest part of the Grand Saut Roquier W. by S. f S. Directions. \u2014 The dangers off the entrance to Grand Havre are so numerous that it can be safely approached by only one channel. This channel lies between the Rousse de Mer and Main rocks ; the former dries 20 feet, the latter 5 feet, at low water, springs. Victoria tower on with the rocky point just eastward of Rousse point martello tower S. f W. westerly* leads in until Saumarez monu ment opens south-westward of Vale church ; then steer for the high rocky bluff near the middle of the bay, and anchor when about mid way between the towers on the entrance points in about 10 feet water. A vessel of only 6 feet draught may anchor with Noirmont guard-house on with Rousse point martello tower, and Victoria * See View nn Admiralty Chart, No. 262, b."], [311, "Chap, vi.] GRAND HAVRE. \u2014 DANGERS OFF. 289 tower about midway between Rousse point and the rocky bluff near the middle of the bay. Roque Noire, Boue Corneille, L'Etac, and Saut Roquier Rocks, lying three quarters of a mile from the coast between Grand Havre and Grande Roque point, extend about the same distance -in an E. by N. and W. by S. direction. They dry respectively 42, 32, 49, and 48 feet, and being always above water, serve to distinguish this part of the coast when the dangerous rocks around them are covered. Grande Roque point has on it a rocky hummock, from which it takes its name, and on which stand a small fort and watch tower. The HoffetS are dangerous rocks, most of which uncover only at low water ; the outer head, then awash, bears N. by E. \\ E. 1\\ cables from the Roque Noire ; the Mouliere uncovers 10 feet nearly midway between it and the Roque Noire, and the Gripe de Rousse 3i cables eastward of the Mouliere has but 3 feet over it. The Rousse de Mer dries 20 feet, only 2\\ cables eastward of the Gripe de Rousse, and is itself surrounded by rocky heads, some of which uncover. Victoria tower on with Rousse point martello tower S. f W. leads f>\\ cables eastward of the outer head of the Hoffets and 1^ cables eastward of the Rousse de Mer ; the Petite Braye open northward of Roque au Nord leads northward of the Hoffets ; and, Torteval spire on with Fort Houmet S.W. southerly leads 2 cables westward of them and clear of all dangers up to the Grand Saut Roquier. Some dangerous rocks, awash at low water, and one which uncovers 11 feet, extend W.N.W. nearly 2 cables from the Grand Saut Roquier ; others outside and northward of them are always covered ; the outer rock, called the Moulrette, has 27 feet water and bears N.N.W. \\ W. 4\u00a3 cables from the Grand Saut Roquier. There is a good channel inside all these rocks, and anchorage, secure from easterly winds, will be found inside the Grand Saut Roquier. The leading mark through the channel is, the lower house on Lihou island touching the outer corner of the Mouilliere rock W. by S. \\ S. ; there is also a channel between the inner head of the Hoffets and the Boue Corneille, but neither channel should be attempted without a pilot. Plaquiers Rocks, with 8 feet water, lie half a mile westward of the Grand Saut Roquier and 1\\ miles S.E. \\ E. easterly from the outer and highest rock of the Grunes de l'Ouest, with Victoria tower A. 2771.

They may be cleared by keeping Victoria tower well open on either side of Grande Roque tower. COBO and VAZON BAYS, half way between Grand Havre and Rocquaine bay, have good anchorage in easterly winds ; but, with westerly winds, there is generally a rolling swell along this coast on the flood tide, and this, together with the numerous outlying rocks, renders these bays dangerous of approach. The principal dangers off these bays inside the Grunes de l'Ouest, described with the other outer dangers at page 275, are the Susanne, which dries 7 feet S.E. by E. a quarter of a mile from the Grunes de l'Ouest ; the Grunette, which dries 3 feet, S. by E. \\ E. half a mile from the Grunes de l'Ouest ; the Boue Auber, which dries 8 feet, E. by S. | S. nearly half a mile from the Sambule ; and, the Flabet, which dries one foot, about midway between the Grande Etacre and Sambule. There are also the Colombelle, which dries 2 feet, N.W. 4r| cables from the Conchee rock at the entrance of Perelle bay ; the Messellettes, nearly awash at low water, N.N.E. half a mile from the Conchee ; the Boue Vazon, which dries 7 feet, and lies with St. George's tower, white, on with the south-western angle of Fort Houmet, and the watch-house on Lihou island just open inside the Conchee ; the Fourquies, awash at low water, S.W. 2\\ cables from the Boue Vazon; the Petit Etat, which dries 20 feet N.N.W. \\ W. 2f cables from Fort Houmet ; and the Gros Etat, which dries 34 feet midway between them and at the outer edge of the rocks off Fort Houmet. The Mouilliere, N. f E. 6\u00a3 cables from Fort Houmet, is 4 feet above high water, springs ; it is surrounded by rocks, of which many uncover ; they extend rather more than a cable westward but not more than three quarters of a cable northward of the Mouilliere. The lower house on Lihou island on with the Conchee rock W.S.W. westerly leads northward of these rocks. Directions. \u2014 To approach Vazon bay from the north-eastward, run in with Torteval spire well open westward of Fort Houmet ; and, as the land is neared and before passing Grand Saut Roquier, be careful to bring Torteval spire on with Richmont fort flagstaff S.W. by S., which mark leads midway between the Grunettes and Mouilliere and nearly a cable eastward of the Boue Vazon ; within which, anchor as convenient in from 6 to 8 fathoms, sand."], [313, "Chap.

The lower house on Lihou island on with the Conchee leads nearly a cable northward of the Boue Vazon ; and, St. Matthew's church on with the south-western end of Fort Houmet leads out between the Sambule and Colombelle. Perelle Bay, westward of the Conchee rock, affords good shelter to fishing boats at low water, but is only safe for such as can take the beach in the event of a westerly gale setting in. In running round from this bay to Rocquaine bay, Hanois lighthouse open eastward of the Trois Peres leads inside and eastward of the rocks extending in that direction from the Grande Etacre. HERM and JETHOU ISLANDS, off the eastern end of Guernsey, together with the Amfroque rocks on the North and the Ferriere and other rocks on the South, extend rather more than 5 miles in a N.E. and S.W. direction, and divide the Great and Little Russell channels from each other. Herm is 1\u00a3 miles long, half a mile wide, 232 feet above the level of low water, and its centre bears East 3 miles from the entrance to St. Peter Port. The little island of Jethou is half a mile south-westward of Herm and 16 feet higher. The rocky islets Crevichon and Fauconniere are connected with Jethou at low water, the former on its northern side, the latter on its southern side ; the summit of each is marked by a white stone conical beacon. The Ferrieres, most conspicuous rocks southward of Jethou, never cover with the tide. The northern head of the Barbees, their outer or north-western rock, bears W.S.W. 6^ cables from Jethou, and is marked by a staff and barrel beacon. The Demie Ferriere, or Demie de Muse, as it is locally known, uncovers 12^ feet 3 cables S. f W. from the Barbees, and one cable eastward from the Muse rock, which itself dries 2\\ feet ; it also is marked by a beacon 10 feet above high water, with the distinguishing letter M in black. There are good ship channels between these rocks, and also between the Ferrieres rocks and the Tetes d'Aval, which lie half a mile S.S.W. \u00a3 W. from the Demie Ferriere, and 1^ miles from Jethou, but they should not be attempted without a pilot. The Tetes d'Aval and other principal rocks southward, westward, and eastward of Jethou are included in the description of the two Russell channels, according as they affect the navigation of the one or the other.

The Grande Amfroque, the outermost rock showing above high water, has two peaks, is nearly three quarters of a cable in diameter, and 78 feet above low water. It is surrounded by dangerous rocks, of which the easternmost is the Bonne Grune, with 14 feet water, which bears from the Grande Amfroque E. \u00a3 S. southerly 1\u00a3 miles, and is at the western side of the entrance to the Great Russell channel. The Selle d'Amfroque, bearing N.E. by E. half a mile from the Grande Amfroque, has 17 feet over it ; and, within it, to the westward, lie the Demies du Nord and the Petite Amfroque, which uncover with the tide. Beacons. \u2014 There are two conical stone beacons on the Grande Amfroque 105 feet apart, bearing S. by E. southerly and N. by W. northerly from each other ; the southern beacon is 35 feet above the rock, surmounted by a cross, and painted black and white in horizontal bands ; the northern beacon is 20 feet high, surmounted by a round cage, and painted white. The two beacons in line indicate the position of the Platte Boue rock, presently described. Cul de l'Autel and Longue Pierre Rocks.\u2014 At 6 cables West from the Grande Amfroque lies the Cul de l'Autel, a table rock 58 feet above low water ; and, between the Cul de l'Autel and the northern point of Herm, at nearly equal distances and about the same height, 70 feet, are the Longue Pierre and Traiffe rocks, and also Godin islet, which, as well as the Longue Pierre, is covered with a light soil, on which grow a variety of wild flowers ; the Traiffe is near the south-eastern side of the Longue Pierre, and resembles a ship under sail. Besides these are many others of minor importance which the tide never covers, as well as numerous tidal rocks and ledges, and many which never uncover at all. Platte Boue Rock, three quarters of a mile northward of the Grande Amfroque, is the northernmost danger off Herm, at the eastern side of the entrance to the Little Russell, and consists of three heads ; the western head has one foot water, and the southern head 3 feet at low water, springs. It is about 20 feet in diameter and steep-to all round, except in an E.N.E. direction, where, at the distance of 165 yards, there is a rock with 15 feet over it. The marks for the Platte Boue are, Catel spire on with the canteen house at the gate of Vale castle, showing at its south-eastern angle, W. by S. southerly ; the Grande Moie, the highest detached"], [315, "Chap, vi.] AMFROQUE ROCKS. \u2014 PASSE PERCEE. 293 rock on the eastern side of Serk, just open eastward of the Grande Amfroque S. by E. easterly ; and, the Grande Amfroque beacons in line S. by E. southerly. Clearing Marks. \u2014 Doyle's column, Guernsey, on with the Brehon tower S.W. \u00a3 W. leads 5 cables, and Tautenay beacon tower, black and white vertical stripes, on with Doyle's column, leads 1^ cables north-westward of Platte Boue rock. Tautenay beacon tower on with Brehon tower is a very close mark, clearing its northern side by only half a cable ; and, Catel spire on with the north-western angle of Vale castle W. by S. \u00a3 S. also clears it on the same side by less than a cable. The channels through and amongst these rocks and islets are extremely intricate, and are rendered dangerous by the rapidity and variety of the tides ; two of them, however, are sometimes used for ships by the Guernsey pilots, viz., Hayes channel, between Godin islet and the Longue Pierre rocks ; and, Passe Percee, between Herm and Jethou. Hayes Channel. \u2014 This channel has a rock awash at low water at its eastern entrance, exactly in line between the Longue Pierre and Godin. Entering the channel from the eastward, to sail southward of this rock, keep Vale mill in sight southward of the Pierre de la Moue until past that line. Pass a cable northward of the Pierre de la Moue, and then haul gradually westward until the high land of Serk at Banquette point comes over Godin, and then haul to the south-westward with Longue Pierre and Grande Amfroque southern beacon in line, until the peak of Godin just open northward of the northern extreme of Galeu bears S.E. \\ E., which mark leads into the Little Russell between the Tautenay ledge and the rocky banks extending from the northern point of Herm.

The Vermerette rock beacon, surmounted by the letter V painted black, on with the Percee rock which dries 34 feet, leads westward of the Meulettes ; and, the western side of the little green plat on the Hermetier, half a point eastward of the highest part of the Mouette, leads eastward of the Tinker. Directions. \u2014 To run through the Passe Percee into the Little Russell, after clearing the Fourquies, bring Vale mill open westward of both the Percee and Corbette rocks, the latter marked by a beacon, N.W. by N. ; this mark clears by 60 yards the outer point of the Percee rock, which is covered at half tide, and leads through the middle of the channel, of which the narrowest part and least depth, 14 feet, will be found in line between the beacon marking the northern extreme of the rocky bank extending from Jethou and the Vermerette beacon. With a proper rise of tide, the same leading mark will carry a vessel right through to the Little Russell, giving the Corbette beacon a berth of half a cable in passing southward of it, but, at this part, there are only from 8 to 12 feet at low water, springs. To carry the deepest water, when Saumarez monument opens northward of Brehon tower, about the apparent breadth of the tower, take it as the leading mark to clear the Etacre rock which dries 3 feet ; when abreast of the Etacre, the Victoria tower is on with the Creux rock beacon, a staff with a black cap or truck, with which mark haul to the westward and proceed up to the Creux rock ; round it, on its southern side, at half a cable to get into the Little Russell, passing between it and the Alligande beacon 2\\ cables S.S.W.

Anchorage.\u2014 Between Herm and Jethou, off the Mouette rock, is the Rosiere anchorage, where small vessels may find good shelter from all winds, except those from S.W. round by South"], [317, "Chap. VI.] PASSE PERCEE. \u2014 LITTLE RUSSELL CHANNEL. 295 to S.E. ; the best entrance is from the Great Russell channel. One great convenience attends this anchorage, viz., that the tide runs 9 hours southward and only 3 hours northward ; the southern stream commencing at low water by the shore, and setting directly into the Great Russell during the whole of the flood and until half ebb, when the northern stream begins and runs with but little strength until low water. A vessel, therefore, caught here by a southerly wind may always, at half ebb, run northward through the Passe Percee into the Little Russell channel, and, from thence, to the anchorage inside the Cavale rock or into the Great road. LITTLE RUSSELL CHANNEL, between Herm and Guernsey, is much contracted by the numerous rocks projecting from each island as far out as the Roustel on the Guernsey side, and the Rousse rock on the side of Herm, which two rocks are little more than 3 cables apart. The wind from N.N.W. round by North and East to S.E. is a leading wind through this channel from the northward, and, without the certainty of a leading wind, no square-rigged vessel of deep draught should attempt its navigation. The entrance to the Little Russell from the northward is between the Braye rocks on the western side and the Amfroque rocks on the eastern. The approach to both these groups is exceedingly dangerous, both on account of the tides which flow across the entrance to the Russell channels, and also from the numerous rocks, hidden and visible, by which they are encompassed ; of which the most dangerous are, the Platte Boue and the Boufresse in the neighbour hood of the Amfroque, and the Roques de Braye, or Platte Fougere, in the vicinity of the Braye. Fairway Buoy. \u2014 To facilitate the navigation of the Little Russell, a Courtenay's automatic signal buoy is moored in 30 fathoms north-eastward of the entrance. It is a red conical buoy with Guernsey fairway in white letters on it. From the buoy, the Amfroque beacons in line bear S. by E. easterly 2f miles ; and Grande Braye beacon W. by S. S. 2| miles. The following are the principal rocks on the western side of the Little Russell channel : \u2014 Braye Rocks. \u2014 The Grande and Petite Braye rocks are about a mile from the shore off the north-eastern point of Guernsey ; they are within a quarter of a mile of each other and both are surrounded by outlying dangerous rocks. The Grande Braye is 10 feet above high water, springs, and has on it a tripod beacon surmounted by a cross ; the Petite Braye is 2 or 3 feet lower."], [318, "296 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 HERM AND JETHOU.

Clearing Mark. \u2014 To clear the Braye rocks and all dangers eastward and southward of them, keep the south-western end of Little Serk open eastward of the low north-eastern sandy point of Herm S. by E. ; this mark leads into the fairway of the Little Russell. Platte Roque dries 10-|- feet S.S.W. f W. 5\u00a3 cables from the Corbette ; it is marked by a beacon mast painted with black and white bands. About a cable E.S.E. from the beacon is a rock awash at low water ; and, from this rock towards the Corbette, on a line curving outwards towards the channel, are several dangerous rocks which should be carefully avoided when passing. Boue Agenor, with only 4 feet water, is the south-western and inner danger on this side of the Little Russell, of which it is necessary to caution strangers. From it, the Coal hole, under Vale castle, on with the end of St. Sampson breakwater bears N. by E. \\ E. ; and, Hougue des Quertiers just open north-eastward of the ruin of Ivy castle N.W. by W.

Rousse Rock. \u2014 The Rousse rock is 8 feet above high water, springs, and is marked by an iron beacon, consisting of a cross with an anchor fluke at each point ; it bears N.W. \\ W. westerly 6 cables from the north-western point of Herm. A dangerous string of rocks, awash at low water, projects in a W. by N. direction 60 yards from the Rousse. Clearing Marks. \u2014 To pass north-westward of all these rocks, keep Catel spire a quarter of a point open northward of Vale castle W. by S. \\ S. ; and, when the north-eastern extreme of Serk is on with the middle of the Grande Amfroque, or when the two beacons on the Grande Amfroque are in line, a vessel is abreast of the Platte Boue. The mark given, Catel church a quarter of a point open northward of Vale castle, leads into the fairway of the Little Russell. Doyle's column on with Brehon tower is a good clearing mark for the rocks on the eastern side of the Little Russell as far as the Ca vale, to clear which the column must be opened one side or the other of Brehon tower ; a vessel is abreast of the Cavale when the Pierre aux Rats obelisk is on with the Mouissoniere rock S.E Doyle's column on with Brehon tower also clears the rocks extend ing from the Rousse, but leads inside the Boues Gennete. THE ROUSTEL is the most dangerous rock in the Little Russell, as it lies exactly in mid-channel and does not uncover until 4 hours ebb. From its shoalest head, the Rousse beacon bears S.S.E. | E. 3h cables ; a sunken rock connected with the Roustel E.N.E. half a cable ; the Corbette beacon N.N.W. 5^ cables ; the Platte Roque beacon W. \\ N. northerly half a mile ; and, the Grune au Rouge S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. nearly one mile.

[Chap. VI. 298 westerly ; no other mark is so conspicuous or shows so quickly the alteration of the vessel's position.* It leads in 6i cables eastward of the Guernsey fairway buoy and on the eastern side of the channel, between the Roustel and Rousse rocks, and directly towards the Boues Gennete ; when the high land at the north-eastern end of Serk begins to shut in with the northernmost bluff land of Herm, or when Saumarez monument appears within its breadth of Mont Crevelt tower W. \u00a3 N., a vessel is between and abreast of the Roustel and Rousse rocks. Near this position, Belvidere house, a large building on the bluff eastward of Fort George, will be on with a white patch just within the eastern extreme of Castle Cornet, which mark leads more than half a cable eastward of the Grune au Rouge, about a cable eastward of the Agenor and all other dangers, and up to the anchorage in the road. This mark leads right up through the Little Russell, and is the only leading line that answers this purpose ; but, as it leads rather near the Grune au Rouge, on approaching and in passing that rock, keep the northern angle of Belvidere house on with the southern angle of the white patch, bearing in mind that the red buoy being on the north eastern side of the Grune au Rouge tails some distance from it when the north-eastern stream is running. To pass north-westward of the Roustel and Grune au Rouge, bring the near angle of Castle Cornet, marked with a vertical white stripe, on with Fort George signal-post, which leads three quarters of a cable westward of the Roustel, and one cable westward of the Grune au Rouge. When Brehon tower is on with Herm tower, a mill without sweeps one third from the southern end of the island, open the leading marks a little either way, to clear the Trois Grunes and the Agenor, and run on until the town church opens southward of the old harbour lighthouse, then haul in for the anchorage. If compelled to beat through the Little Russell, it may be useful to note that St. Martin's point open eastward of the Brehonnet rock, which dries 16 feet a cable westward of the Brehon tower, clears the Roustel ; and, St. Martin's point open one side or the other of the Brehon rock clears the Boues Gennete also on either side. THROUGH DOYLE PASS\u2014 To enter the Little Russell by this channel, keep the windmill on the island of Serk just open northward of the northernmost high land of Herm and on with the Mouisonniere, a remarkable pointed rock on the sandy beach of Herm, bearing * See view on Admiralty chart, No. 262, b."], [321, "Chap, vi.] RUSSELL CHANNELS. \u2014 DOYLE PASS. 299 S.S.E. \u00a3 E., which mark leads through the Pass between the Roque au Nord and the Grande Braye, inside the Brune Pierre which uncovers 4 feet, and between the Grune la Fosse and the Vraic, both awash at low water, into the fairway of the Little Russell. The greatest caution must be used in taking this channel near low water to preserve the leading mark ; the narrowest part is between the Grune Pierre and the rocks off Homptol, its width here being only 217 yards. With the leading mark on, the Pierre aux Rats obelisk appears a little to the left of the Mouisonniere. GREAT RUSSELL CHANNEL is bounded on its north western side by the islands of Herm and Jethou, and by the Amf roques and other rocks north-eastward, eastward, and southward of them ; and, on the south-eastern side, by the islands of Serk and Brecqhou and the rocks in their vicinity. This channel, which is the eastern passage to Guernsey, is about two miles wide and easy of access even to strangers.* The following are its principal dangers on the north-western side, commencing from the northward : \u2014 Bonne Grune Rock, with only 14 feet water, is the outer danger at the northern entrance of the Great Russell. It bears E. by N. \\ N. 3\u00a3 miles from the northern end of Herm ; and, E. \\ S. southerly 1\u00a3 miles from the Grande Amfroque; it is cleared to the eastward by opening the western extreme of Little Serk of the eastern extreme of Brecqhou. Noire Pute Rock, 1\\ miles south-eastward from Herm mill, is never wholly covered, though at equinoctial tides it is sometimes nearly awash. A string of rocks awash at low water extend from it north-eastward nearly 1\\ cables. From the Noire Pute, Doyle's column appears a quarter of a point open southward of the Grande Fauconniere. Grands Bouillons Rocks, having only 9 feet water, lie between the Noire Pute and the Fourquies.

The dangers on the eastern side of the channel are all near the shores of either Serk or Brecqhou ; those only which require special notice being the Givaude rock and the Grune. Givaude Rock, about 70 feet high, forms the eastern boundary of the Great Russell channel. It is 1\\ cables off the western end of Brecqhou, and, from its north-western point, a reef extends nearly one cable.

The Grune can scarcely be called a danger, as there are never less than 48 feet water over it ; it is about 1\u00a3 miles westward of Brecqhou, and causes heavy tide ripples and a dangerous sea in bad weather. From it, the Grande Amfroque on with the Noire Pute bears N.N.E. \u00a3 E. ; and, Victoria tower half the breadth of Castle Cornet open northward of the castle N.W. \u00a3 W. Directions. \u2014 The course from the middle of Alderney Race to the northern entrance of the Great Russell channel is about S.W. by W., and the distance 18 miles. In approaching this channel from the north-eastward, however, great care must be taken to avoid the Bane de la Schole, described at page 345, lying nearly in the direct line between Alderney Race and the entrance. Having entered the channel with the western extreme of Little Serk open eastward of the eastern extreme of Brecqhou as the lead ing mark in order to clear the Bonne Grune ; bring St. Martin's point a quarter of a point open southward of the Goubiniere rock W. \u00a3 S. ; this leads southward of the Noire Pute, the Grands Bouillons, and the Fourquies. Run on with this mark until the Grande Amfroque is its own apparent breadth open south-eastward of the Selle Roque N.E. \\ N. This latter mark must be preserved until the lighthouse on the South pier-head of St. Peter Port old harbour opens southward of Castle Cornet, or until St. Martin's spire, seen over the trees, is on with the martello tower in Fermain bay ; either of these marks leads southward of the Sardriere and Tetes d'Aval ; after having rounded which, steer for the Great road. There is a good channel between the Tetes d'Aval and the Ferriere rocks ; the mid-channel leading mark is, Victoria tower half way between Castle Cornet flagstaff and the northern angle of the castle wall bearing N.W. \\ W. This channel, however, should not be attempted unless in case of emergency, the difficulty of the tides rendering its navigation hazardous. When turning through the Great Russell, the island of Serk may be approached to about half a mile without fear, as there are no rocks more than a quarter of a mile from the shore between the Bee du Nez and Brecqhou island ; but, when standing towards the western point of Brecqhou, and southward of it, take care to keep the Grande Amfroque its own apparent length open westward of the Givaude rock N. by E. E., to clear the Dents and Hautes Boues. Standing northward towards Herm and Jethou, do not shut in St. Martin's point with the Goubiniere when eastward of the latter,"], [324, "302 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 SERK. but keep it a quarter of a point open ; this clears the Fourquies, Grands Bouillons, &c. ; then proceed as before directed. The north-eastern stream of tide slacks half an hour sooner on the south-eastern side of the Great Russell, that is to say, under Serk, than on its north-western side. SERK.\u2014 This island is 3\u00a3 miles S.E. by S. from Herm, and divides the Great Russell from the Deroute channel. It is 1^ miles wide and 2\u00a3 miles long, including Little Serk, with which it is connected by the Coupee, an isthmus or narrow causeway. It is lofty and precipitous throughout, and its highest part, at the base of the windmill near the centre of the island, is 375 feet above the level of low water. The small island of Brecqhou, on its western side, is separated from it by the Gouliot pass, a narrow channel only 70 yards wide, through which the tides run with great velocity. There is no town in Serk, but a small hamlet or group of cottages on the north-eastern side of the island is called La Ville. The island constitutes one Royal Fief or Manor, held direct from the Crown. There are forty original copyhold farms, averaging 15 acres each, the title to which descend in succession to the eldest sons, or if no sons, to the eldest daughters of their occupants. The island is fertile, highly cultivated, and, besides supplying all the wants of its inhabitants, exports largely in cereals and vegetables to Guernsey. Its rocky coast abounds with fish, and especially with crabs and lobsters. All able-bodied men are organized as militia, of which there are about 140 of all arms. Its total population is about 550. There is a church, where the Anglican service is con ducted in French, and two endowed schools. A close approach to Serk on all but the north-western side is difficult, not only from the numerous rocks which encompass it, but also from the rapidity and irregularities of the tide in its immediate vicinity. These difficulties, however, may be easily overcome if attention is paid to the leading marks and run of the stream ; and, the island affords good shelter against almost all winds, as may be seen by following the descriptions given of the different bays. Creux Harbour. \u2014 There are several small inlets in the rocky coasts of Serk, where fishermen haul up and secure their boats in stormy weather ; the most noted and frequented is Creux harbour, so called from a subterraneous passage in its neigh bourhood. It is on the eastern side of the island, and is the general"], [325, "Chap. VI.] CREUX HARBOUR.\u2014 ROCKS AROUND SERK. 303 rendezvous for landing and shipping goods, as well as the principal resort of the fishing and other island boats. It is protected by a small jetty and affords perfect security to small craft ; its entrance is, however, only 60 feet wide, and it dries at low water, springs. The best anchorage off it is with Pin rock on with the Grande Moie, and point Terrible on with High Cliff. Water.\u2014 On the south-eastern side of Serk there is a tolerable run of water in Ixcart bay, on the northern side of Baleine bay, westward of Chateau point ; the stream during the winter season is very copious, and water may be procured with off-shore winds without difficulty. It is the only accessible watering place round the island, with the exception of an inconsiderable drain in port du Moulin, on its north-western side, and another of similar character at Creux harbour. ISLETS and ROCKS around SERK\u2014 The following islets and rocks, always above water, lie off the coasts of Serk : \u2014 The Noire Pierre, 2 cables from the shore off Banquette point on the north-eastern coast, is a small square rock 11 feet above high water and steep-to all round. The Petite Moie, 57 feet above high water, is a rocky mass, steep-to except at its northern point, off which, at the distance of 60 feet, there is a sunken rock. The Grande Moie, off Robert point, is a larger rocky mass 91 feet high and dangerous to approach, especially on its eastern side. The Burons, are a cluster of craggy rocks 66 feet above high water in the form of a half moon, rising nearly perpendicularly from the sea, steep-to on their south-eastern side, but dangerous to approach from any other quarter. They lie about 1^ cables distant in front of Creux harbour, and between them and Serk is the Goulet pass, which dries half way across at low water, springs ; the deepest water, 4 feet, being the outer rocks of Creux. Through this pass the tides run with great strength both ways, but especially about half flood, setting right for and over the Founiais and Grune de Nord rocks on the northern side, and over the Pierre Carree on the southern side ; this pass, therefore, should not be attempted in a sailing vessel, except in a case of the greatest emergency."], [326, "304 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 SERK. The Conchee, about half a mile southward of the Burons and 1^ cables south-eastward of point Terrible, is a square rock, 11 feet above high water, whitened at the top, and having sunken rocks close-to on all sides. The Baleine Rock, in Baleine bay, is 20 feet above high water, and has a rocky reef extending 70 feet from its north-eastern side ; it is 1\u00a3 cables from the shore. Pierre du Cours is a small rock awash at high water and very steep-to on its south-eastern side. As its names implies, it is a useful guide to vessels passing inside the Etac de Serk. Etac de Serk is a rocky islet about 200 feet high off the southern end of Little Serk. In form it resembles a hay-stack and is very conspicuous both from its appearance and position. It is steep-to on its eastern side, but a reef extends half a cable south westward from it ; and, from its northern end, a ledge of rocks which dries 10 feet extends 1\u00a3 cables in the direction of the Pierre du Cours. On the south-western side of Little Serk are numerous rocks, the most conspicuous of which are the Moie du Port Goury, a square topped rock, 62 feet above high water ; the Moie de la Bretagne, a peaked rock, 57 feet high ; and, the Moie de la Fontaine, 57 feet high and close to the shore. THE GIVAUDE ROCK is described at page 300. The Moie Batard, a square rock of a whitish colour, about 20 feet above high water, lies off the north-western coast of Brecqhou.

Many rocks lie within the Blanchard and eastward of the Burons, and between them are navigable channels of from 10 to 26 fathoms water ; they are, however, seldom used by any but the island boats, on account of the impetuous whirl of the tide in this neighbourhood. BALEINE BAY, on the south-eastern side of Serk, betwfeen the Baleine and Conchee rocks, may be resorted to in winter or summer, as it affords excellent anchorage in from 3 to 7 fathoms, sand, fine gravel, and broken shells, and good shelter with the wind from N.N.E round by North to West. Notwithstanding the numerous overfalls and various discoloura tions of water which appear on all sides on approaching this bay, the only shoals are the Tetes de la Conchee, the Gripe, the Vingt Clos, the Balmee, and the Demie Balmee. The Tetes de la Conchae are the outermost of these, and never have less than 6 fathoms water over them. The Gripe, directly in the fairway of the entrance to the bay, has only 6 feet at low water, springs ; from it the Conchee is on with the Goulet rock N.N.E. \\ E. ; and, the Balmee on with the Pignon bears West. The Balmee, which uncovers at a quarter ebb, lies within and westward of the Gripe, with the Baleine in line with the Coupee N. \u00a3 W. ; and, the Western side of the Burons touching the outer or north-eastern part of point Terrible N.E. \u00a3 E. easterly. On this latter line of bearing, three quarters of a cable north-eastward from the Balmee, is the Demie de Balmee, a small rock, which dries 9 feet at low water. The Vingt ClOS bank, 4 cables southward of the Balmee and extending 3 cables farther in that direction, is also about 3 cables east ward of the Etac de Serk ; it consists of sand and shingle interspersed with rocks ; one head at the northern end of the bank dries 3 feet, and two others southward of it have only 3 feet water over them. The southern end of the Coupee on with the Baleine N. by W. \\ W. leads nearly 2 cables north-eastward of the bank ; and, Doyle's column open southward of the Etac de Serk N.W. by W. westerly leads south ward.

GREVE de la VILLE, on the north-eastern side of Serk, gives its name to an anchorage affording good shelter for small vessels during westerly or southerly winds in from 6 to 9 fathoms water ; but, the ground being sand and rock, the anchor is likely to come home unless riding with a long scope of cable. It has also this inconvenience ; should the wind suddenly shift to the north ward or north-eastward at low water, the tide running southward for 3 hours after that time, a sailing vessel could not possibly weather the strong in-draught of the Goulet pass, the effects of which are perceptible half a mile north-eastward of it, and she must there fore either ride at anchor until the offing tide slacks, or, if hard pressed, must at least hold on until there is water enough over the neck of the Goulet.

Directions. \u2014 There are two entrances to the Greve de la Ville \u2014 one from the northward between the island and the Noire Pierre, and one from the southward (which is very narrow) between the island and the Grande Moie. The leading mark from the northward is, the Noire Pierre on with the Chapelle, a remarkable hollowed rock on the shore of which the upper part is whitewashed, bearing S.S.W. \\ W. ; or, the Chapelle half a point open eastward of Banquette point S. \\ W. ; between these limits a vessel may also work in. The Noire Pierre is steep-to on all but its southern side. No leading mark can be given for the southern channel to this anchorage between the Grande Moie and the island. It never has less than 3 fathoms, but a rock awash at low water lies 150 feet within the Grande Moie, and is connected with it under water ; care must, therefore, be taken to pass nearer to Robert point, which is steep-to, rather than in mid-channel. A cable northward of Robert point also a dangerous reef extends half a cable from the shore ; and, the Demie, a half-tide rock, lies half a cable S.W. from the Petite Moie. Anchorage. \u2014 The best anchorage is between Petite Moie and the island, with the eastern extreme of the Burons just open of Robert point S. by E. \\ E. ; outside this line the stream runs strongly ; within or westward of it the stream is scarcely perceptible. There is good anchorage on the north-eastern side of Serk, outside all the rocks, in from 14 to 19 fathoms, fine clean sand, with St. Martin's point, Guernsey, on with the Corbee du Nez W. \\ N. ; and, the Chapelle rock midway between the Noire rock and Banquette point S. by W. This anchorage, however, can only be used in fine weather, with the wind between West and S.S.W. BANQUETTE BAY, on the north-western side of Serk, affords good shelter against easterly, south-easterly, and southerly winds in from 5 to 10 fathoms, coarse sand interspersed with small black stones and pieces of sea-weed. Should the wind chop round to the westward, a vessel at anchor here may even then be able to weather the Bee du Nez, and from thence may push to sea, or haul under the lee of the island.

The Grune de GouliOt, with 6 feet water, bears N. \\ E. 2 cables from the eastern end of Brecqhou. The Petite Banquette is a narrow bank of fine sand with a sharp ridgy apex. It is about 2 cables in extent, North and South, and has 16 feet on the shoalest part near the middle, from which the Platte Roque, off port du Moulin, bears E. by S. \\ S. 2 cables. In heavy gales from the north-eastward or westward, this bank has been reported to shift a cable or more in one tide, which here runs south-eastward from low water to half flood, and south-westward from half ebb to low water. Anchorage. \u2014 The best deep-water berth in Banquette bay is in 9 fathoms, with Givaude rock on with Moie Batard S.W. by W. W. ; Little Serk mill, without arms, on with the western side of Gouliot island S. \u00a3 W. ; and, Manor tower and North cliff of port du Moulin in line S.E. \u00a3 E. r GRANDE GREVE is the anchorage on the south-western side of Serk, between Brecqhou and Little Serk. It takes its name from the great beach of fine white sand under the Coupee uniting Serk with Little Serk. The approach to it is much encumbered by rocks, but there is plenty of room notwithstanding, and good shelter from S.S.E., East, and N.E. winds, in from 7 to 11 fathoms, fine sandy bottom with pieces of shells. It is not prudent, however, for a sail ing vessel to remain at anchor here if the wind shifts northward or southward of the points specified ; for a W.S.W. wind, from the long fetch it commands, brings in a heavy swell, and the obstruction caused by the weather tide coming through the Gouliot pass, raises it to such a height as to preclude the possibility of a vessel riding out even a moderate gale. Should a vessel, therefore, be caught by a westerly wind at this anchorage, she should immediately endeavour to get out either to the westward or through the Gouliot pass, which latter may with con fidence be taken at half flood."], [331, "Chap. VI.] GRANDE GREVE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 309 Dangers off the Grande Greve:\u2014 The Hautes Boues are a group of rocks off the north-western side of Little Serk. The outer north-western rock dries 4 feet, and bears N.W. by W. 4 cables from the Moie de la Fontaine, a high rock close in-shore and 60 feet above the high water level ; there is deep water close to this north western rock, northward and westward of it, but a string of dangerous rocks extend from it 3^ cables in a S.S.W. direction; there are also numerous rocks within this line to the eastward, of which five heads dry at low water. There is no safe channel for large vessels inside the Hautes Boues. The Dents, a rocky mass off the south-western end of Brecqhou, are awash at high water, springs. They are steep-to and safe of approach from the southward. The Baveuse is a large rock N. \u00a3 E. 1\\ cables from the Moie de la Fontaine. It covers 4 feet at high water and is surrounded by other smaller rocks. From the Baveuse, in the direction of the Gouliot pass, there are several dangerous rocks, of which the Boue de Baie has only 3 feet, and another rock three quarters of a cable northward of it only 2 feet water. From the Boue de Baie, the Baveuse bears S.S.W. \u00a3 W. 2 cables ; the Chapelle, a large rock northward of Jeu point, is on with that point ; and, the Pierre au Norman appears in the middle of the chasm between the Moie du Gouliot and Tour islet. Directions. \u2014 The leading mark for the inner anchorage in the Grande Greve, passing northward of the Hautes Boues and south ward of the Boue de Baie, is, the southern end of the Coupee on with Jeu point E. by S. \\ S. southerly. Serk mill on with the gap in the outer part of Longue point, bearing East, leads southward of the Dents and northward of all dangers in the bay until the Pierre au Norman is on with the eastern end of Brecqhou, which mark then leads southward to the anchorage. The best anchorage mark is the Pierre au Norman on with the eastern point of Brecqhou, and about two thirds of the Coupee roadway open southward of the south-eastern point of Serk. A good position in the outer part of the bay in about 12 fathoms is, with Serk mill on with Longue point, and the Givaude between Brecqhou and the Dents. It should, however, be observed that as Serk mill will be hidden behind the intervening high land of Longue point before a vessel arrives abreast of the Dents, it is necessary to look out in time for another object in the same line of direction."], [332, "[Chap. VI. 310 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 SERK. Tidal streams around Serk.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Serk at the same time as at St. Peter Port, viz., at 6h. 37m., and there is about the same rise and fall, see page 284. The direction of the streams in the immediate vicinity of the island is subject to great variety, it being governed by the configuration of the land. On its north-eastern side, there is a space in which an eddy or slack tide exists during the whole of the six hours that the stream is running north-eastward in the Great Russell and Deroute channels ; this expanse of g slack water extends about 2 miles from the land, gradually contracting in width as it increases its distance from the shore. The marks for its north-western and south-eastern limits are, the western end of Brecqhou island on with the Corbee du Nez ; and, the Etac de Serk just appearing eastward of the land at Le Creux. The ordinary limit of its distance from the land is attained when Vale mill comes on with the Sardinias rock off the eastern side of Herm. Outside the north-western and south-eastern limits here given, even at the distance of a cable, run the true Russell and Deroute streams. The stream in Baleine bay, in Terrible bay, and in the neighbour hood of the Conchee, Baleine, and Balmee rocks, runs north-eastward 7j hours and south-westward for only 4j hours. The first begins an hour after low water by the shore and runs until 2^ hours ebb, when the south-western stream commences and runs faintly for the remaining 4i hours, or until an hour after low water again. The streams on the north-eastern side of Serk, in the Greve de la Ville, and in the neighbourhood of the Grande and Petite Moie rocks, &c, run %\\ hours S. by E. and only 3^ hours N. by W. The southern stream commences at 4 hours flood and runs until half an hour after low water, when the northern stream commences and runs faintly for the remaining 3^ hours, or until 4 hours flood again. The southern stream above mentioned, on the north-eastern side of Serk, and the northern one on the south-eastern side, branch off to the eastward of the Burons, where they meet and unite with the Deroute stream, which sets directly both ways, and runs for equal spaces of time on both tides. A curved line drawn from 3 or 4 cables southward of the Etac de Serk through the Grune Noire to the south eastern limit of the space of slack water before mentioned, on the north-eastern side of the island, divides the irregular streams in shore from that of the Deroute ; and, this line continued from this spot close round the Bee du Nez towards the Givaude rock, and from thence to within 3 or 4 cables of the Etac de Serk again, divides the regular Russell stream from the irregular streams within it."], [333, "Chap, vi.] 311 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 OYSTER GROUND. The stream on the north-western side of Serk begins to run to the southward at the Bee du Nez, and from thence along the land towards Brecqhou island, at three quarters flood ; near Brecqhou, it meets with the stream from the Gouliot pass, which latter, prevailing, carries it with a curve north-westward into the Great Russell, where it unites with the regular stream. The stream begins to run north eastward along the shore of the Moie du Gouliot towards Bee du Nez at three quarters ebb, and so continues until three quarters flood again. The stream on the south-western side of Serk in the neighbour hood of the Hautes Boues, Bretagne, Sercul, &c, runs 4^ hours northward, and only 1^ hours southward ; the former stream com mences at half flood and runs for one hour, it then suddenly turns and runs south-eastward for 1J hours, or until half an hour before high water by the shore, at which time it again as suddenly veers to the northward and sets in that direction for the remaining 3^ hours, or until half ebb. The stream in the Gouliot pass runs for equal spaces of time, corresponding to that in the Great Russell, and does not partake of the irregularity of the tides in its vicinity. On the contrary, the force and shape of the flood stream, acquired by the contracted and peculiar form of the channel between Serk and Brecqhou, is continued until it falls into the Russell channel ; the same is the case with the ebb until it unites with the stream south-westward of the Hautes Boues. Oyster-Ground. \u2014 About 11 miles in a north-easterly direc tion from Coupe point, the north-eastern extreme of Jersey, and nearly 14 miles in a south-eastern direction from the middle of Serk, is an extensive oyster ground, the marks for which are as follows ; the island of Jethou on with the Bee du Nez, Serk ; Rozel mill on with the Burons de Drouilles ; and, the two high heads of the Pierres de Lecq on with point Grosnez. There is very little difference in the depths of water in its neighbourhood."], [334, "312 CHAPTER VII. THE CASQUETS ISLETS ; BURHOU ISLAND ; ALDERNEY ISLAND ; BANC DE LA SCHOLE ; AND ALDERNEY RACE. VARIATION IN 1888, 18\u00b0 10' W. The islands and rocks which occupy so large a portion of the space between lie de Brehat and cape de la Hague extend northward as far as the parallel of that cape, where their northern portion forms a chain 9 miles long W. by N. \\ N. and E. by S. \\ S., and 3 miles wide. This chain is formed by three distinct groups, viz., by the Casquets islets and rocks at its western end, by the island of Alderney at the eastern end, and by Burhou island and its rocks in the centre. They are separated from the coast of France by the Race of Alderney, a channel 8 miles wide, and from the island of Guernsey and its islets by a space about 12 miles wide. CASQUETS ISLETS and ROCKS,* so named, probably, from their remarkable helmet or cap-like appearance, lie N.W. by W. \\ W. 6 miles from Alderney old telegraph tower, and form a group half a mile in length W.N.W. and E.S.E. by from 1 to 2 cables in width. The largest and highest of the rocks form a mass near the centre of the group, on which stand the lighthouse and two other stone towers ; all three towers were lighthouses until 1877, when the north-western tower was raised to its present height and maintained as the lighthouse, the eastern tower was reduced in height and con verted into the fog-horn station, and the southern tower reduced in height and made into a store-house. The rocks are 90 feet above high water, and, at low water, all this central mass is connected and extends 3 cables in a W.N.W. and E.S.E. direction, with a width of 1\u00a3 cables at its widest part, abreast of the lighthouse. Eastward from this central mass, for 1\\ cables, lie six high rocks detached from each other at low water by narrow gullies through which the tide rushes with great velocity ; the eastern rock is the Colotte, it is 33 feet above high water, very steep-to. * See Admiralty plan with views :\u2014 Alderney and Casquets, No. 60 ; scale, m = 4 inches."], [335, "Chap, vil] CASQUETS ISLETS AND ROCKS. 313 The entire group is as steep as a wall on the southern and eastern sides, though separated on the latter side by only 2 cables from the Fourquies rocks, which dry 13 feet ; but, on the northern side, between point Colotte and the lighthouse, are two small detached heads which uncover at low water ; they are, however, only a quarter of a cable distant from the central mass. On the western side, rocks, presently described, extend nearly 4 cables, and render that side dangerous of approach. LIGHT. \u2014 From the lighthouse, which is 75 feet high and coloured white, is exhibited, at 120 feet above high water, a flashing white light, showing three successive flashes of about two seconds duration each, divided by intervals of about three seconds of darkness, the third flash being followed by an eclipse of about eighteen seconds. The light is visible in clear weather from a distance of 15 miles. Fog Signal. \u2014 During thick or foggy weather a powerful siren trumpet at the eastern tower gives three blasts of two seconds duration each, in quick succession, every five minutes. Between the first and second blasts, and also between the second and third, intervals of three seconds occur. Landing. \u2014 The Little Casquet rock, three quarters of a cable southward of the lighthouse and 53 feet above high water, shelters a landing-place for boats on the main rock at an inlet named Petit Havre ; there is also a landing-place on the eastern side of the Little Casquet rock, and another in a rocky bight on the northern side of the main group. The possibility of safe landing at either of these places is com municated to an approaching vessel by the hoisting of a flag on the platform staff between the towers. When landing can be effected at Petit Havre, a blue flag is hoisted ; when at the southern cove on the easterrk side of the Little Casquet, St. George's Ensign ; and, when at the northern landing-place in the north-eastern cove, a red flag. When no flag is shown, landing is not considered to be safe anywhere. The following are the rocks lying off the western side of the Casquets : \u2014 Auquiere Rock, three quarters of a cable W.N.W. from the western end of the main group, is one third of a cable in diameter and 44 feet above high water. Sunken rocks extend a third of a cable northward of the Auquiere, as well as westward and southward"], [336, "314 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. of it. There is a boat channel between it and the Casquets, but it is very narrow, owing to a ledge of sunken rocks which extends nearly half way across from the western point of the Casquet group, and it is rendered still more dangerous by other rocks to the southward which dry at low water ; it should only be used, therefore, in cases of urgent necessity. Noire Roque, or Black Rock, lies W. \u00a3 S. 3^ cables from the lighthouse, and W.S.W. westerly nearly 2 cables from the Auquiere ; it is a quarter of a cable in diameter, about 16 feet above high water, and is craggy and unapproachable. Noire Roque Ledge, with only 8 feet water, lies N.W. \\ W. westerly 1\\ cables from Noire Roque. Its position is generally indicated by a strong ripple, and, with any swell, the sea breaks furiously over it. A sunken rock with only 4 feet water lies midway between Noire Roque and the Auquiere ; no vessel ought, therefore, to attempt to pass between them. Eight-Fathoms Ledge.\u2014 N.W. by W. \\ W. 7 cables from the Auquiere is a bank of sunken rocks, on which the least water obtained when surveyed was 13 fathoms, but there is said to be as little as 8 fathoms. The bank is from 40 to 50 yards in extent, and rises suddenly from soundings of 25 and 27 fathoms ; although it cannot be touched by vessels even of the deepest draught, it is never theless dangerous, for it causes violent eddies at all times, and during fresh winds the sea breaks on it. Anchorage can be safely attempted only on the south-eastern side of the Casquets, and while the south-western stream is running, and then only by a steam-vessel. The best spot is in 15 fathoms, fine sand ; the north-eastern tower bearing N. by W. \\ W., and Fort Albert on with the Ortac rock seen between the Equet and Fourquie rocks. This position, although 1\\ cables from the rocks, is quite safe in fine weather when carefully taken up ; it is sheltered from the tide by the Casquet rocks. At 100 yards within it the depth is 8 fathoms, and at the same distance outside 23 fathoms. CAUTION.\u2014 The great strength of the tidal stream near these rocks renders an incautious approach to them during foggy weather extremely hazardous; it is therefore recommended at such times never to run for them with the tide, but either to wait for slack"], [337, "Chap. VII.] DANGERS AROUND THE CASQUETS. 315 water or until the stream in its usual rotary changes turns from the desired direction ; or, to alter the position of the vessel astream of the rocks to leeward, in order to approach them against the tide. Should a shoal cast be obtained when running for the Casquets in thick weather, the vessel's head should be immediately turned against the tide ; after which, haul out cautiously into deep water. Fourquie and Equet Rocks.\u2014 A bank of pebbles, sand, and broken shells, with from 6 to 10 fathoms water, extends nearly a mile E.S.E. from Colotte point ; the Fourquie, before mentioned, separated by a channel only 2 cables wide from Colotte point, is near the western end of this bank, and the Equet near its eastern end. The Equet is rather a long,straggling,and dangerous rock ; its northern head is the highest part and dries 7 feet ; this head bears from the north-eastern Casquet tower S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. 1^ miles. A detached rocky bank with as little as 33 feet lies one third of a mile eastward of the Equet. The Fourquie dries 13 feet at low water and is steep-to except on its eastern side, where there is a detached sunken rock. The Fourquie bears S.E. by E. E. more than half a mile from the north-eastern tower ; and, S.E. E. 2\\ cables from Colotte point. There is no safe channel between the Fourquie and Equet rocks, nor is it safe to approach the eastern side of the latter nearer than half a mile. Whirling eddies, thrown up by the tide rushing over the rugged bottom at these parts, render a vessel involved in them quite unmanageable. The tide sets fairly through the channel between the Fourquie and Colotte point, and, in it, there are 10 fathoms water over a tolerably even bottom ; a steamer may, therefore, safely pass through it in fine weather ; but, near spring tides, with any swell on, it is not prudent to attempt it. South- westward and southward of the Casquets are several extensive banks on which the least known depth is 4 fathoms, but from the overfalls and heavy sea over them in bad weather they are then very dangerous ; they seem to be formed by a deposit caused by the turn of the stream between low water and half flood ; for, near them at this time, the last of the westerly Channel stream, after passing between the Ortac and the Casquets, meets the south-easterly stream then running south-westward of the Casquets. A description of these banks now follows. CASQUET S.W. BANK.\u2014 The shoalest spot of 4 fathoms on this bank lies S.W. southerly 4^ miles from the Casquets lighthouse ; the bank is of fine gravel, sand, and shells, 3\u00a3 miles long within the"], [338, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C [Chap. VII. 316 20-fathoms line, in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, and nearly a mile wide. The highest part of the bank is near the middle, close to its western side ; the 10-fathoms line here includes a space just 2 miles long and barely a quarter of a mile wide, the shoal part of 4 fathoms being half a mile within its south-western end. From it, Alderney old telegraph tower bears East a little northerly ; and, Doyle's column on with the north-eastern extreme of Guernsey S.W. \u00a3 S. Doyle's column on with Vale mill S.S.W. \u00a3 W. leads rather more than a mile westward of the S.W. bank. The channel between the S.W. and S.S.W. banks is from one to 2 miles wide, and has from 22 to 29 fathoms water. CASQUET S.S.W. and S.S.E. BANKS are steep ridgy banks of fine sand, within and eastward of the S.W. bank and lying nearly across the south-western entrance to the Ortac channel. The northern point of the S.S.W. bank in 18 fathoms bears S.W. \\ S. nearly 1^ miles from the Casquets lighthouse, and, from this, it extends due South rather more than 1\\ miles, after which the water deepens and the tail of the bank turns off to the eastward. This bank is a quarter of a mile wide within the 20-fathoms line ; it has a short ridgy apex with depths of from 12 to 13 fathoms, and 11 fathoms on the shoalest part near the middle. The Casquet S.S.E. bank is rather more than 3 miles long within the 20-fathoms line in a N.E. and S.W. direction, and three quarters of a mile wide ; its south-western end, after the water deepens to 18 fathoms, turns off north-westward and unites with the S.S.W. bank. A narrow ridge of shoal water, a mile in extent, runs along the middle of the S.S.E. bank ; it has 4| fathoms at its north-eastern end, and only 4 fathoms at its south-western end, with irregular soundings of from 5 to 8 fathoms between. From the north-eastern shoal spot of 4^ fathoms, Tourgis beacon over the middle of Clonque fort bears E. \u00a3 N. northerly ; and, the Clonque and Tourgis fort beacons in line E. by N. northerly, the same mark as for the Pierre au Vraic, passes over the top of the bank midway between the shoal spdts at its extremes. At the north-eastern extreme of the 10-fathoms line, the Casquets lighthouse bears N.W. by N. nearly 3 miles, and at the south-western extreme N. \\ W. westerly ?>\\ miles. The shoal spots are difficult to pick up, being generally the summits of sharp ridges of sand and very steep ; the ridges appear to run rather across the bank in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, but in all probability they shift with the turn of the tide."], [339, "Chap, vie] CASQUET AND POMMIER BANKS. 317 Anchorage.\u2014 Vessels should avoid anchoring on the S.S.W. bank, there being at all times a strong ripple over it ; but, on the S.S.E. bank, in fine weather, vessels cruising in the vicinity may anchor with advantage. The best anchorage is in from 6 to 10 fathoms, with the Ortac rock midway between Renonquet and Verte-tete N.E. easterly, and the Casquets N. by W. \u00a3 W. Clearing Marks.\u2014 To clear the Casquet S.S.E. bank outside and southward of the 10-fathoms line, keep the Etac de la Quoire open half a point southward of the Orbouee rock E. \\ N. To clear it to the northward, the inner top of the Great Coque Lihou touching the northern side of the Coupe rock E. by S. \\ S. leads more than half a mile northward of the northern shallow spot in 10 fathoms. Verte tete behind the Ortac N.E. \u00a3 N. leads clear to the eastward ; and, the western side of Renonquet on with the eastern side of the Ortac rock N.E. \u00a3 E. leads clear to the westward. CASQUET MIDDLE BANK is about midway between the northern parts of the S.S.W. and S.S.E. banks ; it is nearly circular, about 4 cables in diameter, and has from 15 to 20 fathoms water, with gravel and broken shells bottom. The general depth round all the Casquet banks is from 22 to 25 fathoms. POMMIER BANKS, on the western side of the Ortac channel, are two extensive and dangerous groups of sunken rocks, divided by a narrow 12-fathoms channel. The highest head is near the western end of the western bank ; it has only 13 feet water, and lies E. by N. \\ N. northerly 1^ miles from the Casquets ; from it, the Ortac rock appears midway between Alderney old telegraph tower and the south western brick kilns S.E. \\ E. ; and, Casquets lighthouse and north eastern tower nearly in line bear W. by S. \\ S. southerly. From this 13-feet rock, the eastern end of the eastern bank bears E. \\ S. one mile. The least known depth on this bank is 5 fathoms, but there may be 2 or 3 feet less. Clearing Marks. \u2014 The north-eastern and south-eastern Casquet towers in line S.W. \\ W. lead three quarters of a mile north-westward ; the Noires Putes midway between the Ortac rock and Renonquet S.S.E. \\ E. leads nearly half a mile eastward ; and, St. Anne's church steeple on with the Ortac S.E. by E. \\ E. easterly leads half a mile south-westward of them and southward of the Danger rocks ; it is also the best leading mark for entering the Ortac channel between the Pommier banks and Equet rocks."], [340, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. 318 Danger Rocks, with 21 feet water, lie 7 cables southward of the Pommier banks and E. \\ S. 2 miles from the Casquets. These rocks are very little more than half a cable in extent East and West, but there may be a few feet less water on them than that given ; they must therefore be approached with caution. The channel between Danger rocks and the Equet bank has 15 fathoms, and is nearly three quarters of a mile wide ; it is therefore quite safe for a vessel under perfect command in fine weather; but, in bad weather, and especially at spring tides, no vessel should attempt it ; indeed at such times, neither this nor any of the channels between the Casquets and Ortac should be used, for the entire space is then covered with tremendous overfalls, in which the largest vessels would be quite unmanageable ; even during fine weather there are overfalls, but being then confined to the shoalest parts, they serve to mark the positions of the highest rocky heads, and thus rather contribute to the safety of the navigation. Speedy Rock, nearly half a mile N. W. from the Verte-tete, marks the northern boundary of the Ortac channel on its eastern side ; the shoalest spot known has 33 feet water ; from it, the outer high rock of the Etacs on with the high central rock of Renonquet bears S. by E. \u00a3 E. ; and, Fort Albert flagstaff the apparent breadth of the fort open southward of the Great Nannel S.E. by E. Verte-tete Reef, north-eastward of the Ortac rock, marks the northern extreme of the dangerous rocks, stretching north-westward more than a mile from the western end of Little Burhou islet. There are three high rocks on this reef, of which the Cone rock, the most remarkable, is the westernmost ; it bears N.N.E. \u00a3 E. 8 cables from the Ortac rock ; and, E. \\ S. 3^ miles from the Casquets. It is of sugar-loaf form and about 20 feet above high water ; it is detached from the main reef at all times of tide, is very steep-to on its northern side, but, at three quarters of a cable westward, there is a small pointed rock which uncovers 6 feet. The principal rock of the Verte-tete reef is 13 feet higher and much larger than Cone rock ; it has, moreover, two heads ; the south western and highest is flat at the top ; the other, a quarter of a cable north-eastward of it, being lower, smaller, and peaked. A reef, dry at low water, extends nearly a cable eastward of the high head of Verte-tete, and a sunken rock bears E.N.E. about one cable from it ; with the exception of the dangers described, those of the Verte-tete rocks which are always above water, are very steep-to on the northern side."], [341, "Chap. VII.] VERTE-TETE. \u2014 ORTAC ROCK AND CHANNEL. 319 ORTAC ROCK.\u2014 At 3\u00a3 miles E. by S. \\ S. from the Casquets lighthouse lies this remarkable, huge, and nearly inaccessible rock ; it is 79 feet above high water, and may be seen in clear weather 9 or 10 miles distant. Its southern side is steep-to, having 8 fathoms within half a cable of the rock, but a sunken ledge, with only 11 feet at its outer edge, extends 1\u00a3 cables N.W. by W. from the rock, and, from it, Clonque fort is just in sight southward of the Ortac. From the highest part of this ledge three quarters of a cable south-west ward of the Ortac, with 14 feet water, Fort Albert flagstaff is just in sight southward of the Ortac rock. To pass westward of the ledge when coming from the southward, keep Fort Albert flagstaff well open southward of the Ortac rock until Verte-tete bears N.E. by E. Between Ortac, Verte-tete, and Burhou island, are scattered many dangerous sunken rocks and ledges, near and amongst which the streams run with great velocity. ORTAC CHANNEL is bounded on its eastern side by the Ortac rock and ledge, just described, and by the rocks extending from Renonquet and Verte-tete, with the Speedy rock as its northern and eastern boundary ; and, on its western side, by the eastern Pommier bank, Danger rocks, and the Equet reef, already described. There is also, near mid-channel, the Dasher rock, with 6\u00a3 fathoms water ; vessels may pass on either side of this rock, but the passage on its eastern side is the best. The northern entrance of the Ortac channel, between the eastern Pommier bank and Speedy rock, is more than a mile wide ; its narrowest part, eastward of the Dasher rock, is nearly three quarters of a mile wide ; at this part, the Great Nannel rock appears a little open northward of the high head of Renonquet E. by S. ; this mark leads over the Dasher rock, from which, the outer high rock of the Etacs, off the western end of Alderney, touching the north-eastern side of the Ortac bears S.E. \\ S. The general depth in this channel is about 15 fathoms, with toler ably regular soundings, but the bottom is rocky and foul throughout ; anchoring, therefore, except when unavoidable, is not to be thought of. The tides here run with great strength, especially near high or low water, and, at springs, they attain a velocity of more than 7 knots ; in the course of their rotary change of direction they set across the channel, and, although when running in this direction their strength decreases, an incautious pilot might soon be swept amongst dangerous rocks. From these and previous remarks, it should be understood that these channels are at all times hazardous for sailing vessels, and even for steamers unless those who navigate them possess consider able local knowledge."], [342, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. 320 Directions. \u2014 To pass through the Ortac channel from the north ward, bring the Ortac rock to bear S. \\ E. and steer direct for it on this bearing ; and, when the Great Nannel comes on with the Verte tete E. by S. \\ S., steer S.S.W. W., which course leads through the channel about 2\u00a3 cables westward of the outer part of the Ortac ledge. As before stated, when the Great Nannel is nearly on with the northern part of the highest head of Renonquet, a vessel is abreast of the Dasher rock, southward of which the deep-water channel is nearly two miles wide. When bordering on the northern side of the Ortac rock, the ledge off it may be cleared by not bringing the Great Nannel nearer to Burhou reef than the middle of the water gap or channel between it and Renonquet ; when fort Albert is open southward of the Ortac rock, a vessel is southward of the Ortac ledge ; and, when Noir Houmet, a high rock on the southern side of Burhou island, opens southward of the Ortac, she is clear of the Equet and of all danger to the southward. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the Casquets and at the Ortac rock at 6 h. 45 m. ; equinoctial springs rise 24 feet, ordinary springs 15^ feet, and neaps 10 feet. Tidal Streams. \u2014 Although the tidal stream in the immediate neighbourhood of the Casquets preserves the rotary character so frequently alluded to, it varies much in strength and direction, according to position. On their northern side and to the eastward, for instance, when outside the influence of the Ortac channel, the slack and change of stream takes place as in the offing, the great body of the flood setting E. by N. and the ebb W. by S. ; but, west ward of the Casquets, the strength of the stream is principally felt in three different directions, viz. : \u2014 at 2\\ hours flood, South 3-7 knots ; at one hour ebb, E.N.E. 3-0 knots ; and, an hour before low water, W. by N. 3d knots ; between these points, a continuous stream sets westward, southward, and eastward, the only slack occurring between 3 and 4 hours ebb. On the south-western side of the Casquets, between half ebb and low water, there is an eddy nearly 2 miles wide and of considerable strength. Between low water and 2 hours flood, this eddy extends farther eastward and increases in breadth ; and, for a time, it thus continues but gradually becomes weaker and finally disappears at about half flood. Eddies exist also on the north-eastern side of the Casquets, but their action is exactly the reverse of those on the south western side."], [343, "Chap, vil] 321 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 BURHOU ISLAND. The stream in the Casquets channel \u2014 that is, in its immediate draught \u2014 begins to set south -westward exactly at half ebb by the shore, and runs in that direction for 6 hours, or until half flood ; and, the contrary is the case with the north-eastern stream, for there is neither high nor low water slack here. The stream, which begins to run north-eastward at half flood through the Ortac channel, gradually turns more northward after passing the Ortac rock and sets N.N.E. until it again unites with the stream flowing eastward past the northern side of the Casquets. The south-western stream of this channel, which commences at half ebb, sets right over the Equet and the Fourquies, to avoid which rocks the utmost care must be taken. On the south-western side of the Ortac rock, there is an eddy nearly 1^ miles in extent between half ebb and one hour's flood ; after which, the stream on the southern side of the Ortac gradually inclines westward, setting directly for the Casquets at 2 hours flood, until it runs into the last of the south-western stream in the Casquet channel. There is no eddy of consequence on the north-eastern side of the Ortac rock. BURHOU ISLAND lies East 1\u00a3 miles from the Ortac ; it is nearly level towards the middle, though huge rocks crop out near the extremes, and it is fringed with reef. The western part of Burhou is cut off from the main part at high water, the portion thus detached being called Little Burhou. The two islands together are 6 cables long East and West and nearly 2 cables wide, their rocky peaks being about the same height, 87 feet above high water ; they are covered with a light soil, on which grow coarse grasses and a variety of wild flowers ; the soil is burrowed in every direction by rabbits, formerly very numerous, but now nearly exterminated by the Alderney fisher men ; their holes are now frequently the breeding places of various kinds of sea birds, and, among others, ot the stormy petrel, which resorts to these islands during the breeding season. There is a small anchorage on each side of the island and a refuge for fishermen and shipwrecked mariners on the low saddle near the middle. The landing places are in two small coves near the refuge, one on either side of the island. No fresh water can be obtained except such as may be deposited by rain in the interstices of the rocks. Burhou Reef. \u2014 The eastern side of Burhou is clear of danger to within half a cable of the shore, but a reef extends westward of Little Burhou for half a mile, and the whole of it, with the exception of a A. 2771.

VII. few rocky heads, covers at high water ; numerous detached rocks lie along the edge of this reef on both its southern and western sides. There is a 5-fathoms channel between Burhou reef and the rocks extending 4 cables eastward of the Ortac rock, and also a very narrow channel called the Passe de la Maure, northward of Burhou reef, and leading into the Little Swinge ; only the most expert pilots amongst the Alderney fishermen can navigate either of these channels with safety. Dangers northward of Burhou Island.\u2014 The following rocks and ledges lie north-westward, northward, and north-eastward of Burhou island, effectually closing all approach to it from that direction except by one narrow channel between the Maquereaux reef and the Nannels: \u2014 Renonquet Reef, on the northern side of the Passe de la Maure and a quarter of a mile within the Verte-tete, see page 318, is nearly three quarters of a mile long East and West ; its western end is low and covers with the tide for 3g cables, but, near the eastern end, is a group of high rocks about 1^ cables in diameter which never cover. The highest of this group is 43 feet above high water and about 3 cables south-eastward of the high head of Verte-tete, in line between it and the peak of Little Burhou. White Rock is 2\\ cables eastward of the highest Renonquet ; it is small, 20 feet above high water, steep-to, and safe of approach on its northern side. Only one other rock eastward of this, near the Renonquet group, is visible at high water ; this is a small head 10 or 12 feet above high water S.E. by E. \\ E. 1^ cables from White rock ; therefore, the White rock eastward, the Verte-tete westward, and the Renonquet rock in the middle, form together a remarkable group for recognition by the mariner set in here during foggy weather. Maquereaux Rocks. \u2014 A sunken reef, 2 cables in extent North and South and a cable wide, is half a mile eastward of the White rock ; three heads near the middle of the reef have only 4 feet water, and there is no safe channel through the chain of rocks between the Maquereaux and Verte-tete. The outer Etac on with the saddle rock of Burhou just westward of the refuge S. \\ W. leads eastward of the Maquereaux rocks ; and, the Casquet towers their apparent breadth open northward of Verte-tete W. \\ N. leads one cable northward.

The Nannels, said to be an English corruption of Les Nianaises, is a reef about 4 cables long East and West and 2\\ cables wide ; it forms the north-eastern part of the Burhou group, and consists of enormous and curiously shaped rocks, of which some are always above water and others cover and uncover with the tide. The Great Nannel, the highest, is 52 feet above high water, and is near the middle of the south-western part of the reef. The Little Nannel, the next in height, is only 16 feet above high water, and is at the north-western end of the reef, one cable distant from the Great Nannel. Other but smaller rocks above high water extend 2 cables in an easterly direction from the Great Nannel. The end of the group in this direction is the Pierre de But ; this rock covers near high water. The Boues de But, two sunken rocks having 9 feet over them, lie one third of a cable eastward of the Pierre de But. The Cordonnier, a small rock drying 3 feet, lies 1\\ cables southward of the Great Nannel. The width between Burhou and the Nannels is just 2 cables ; the Equet, a rock near the middle which dries 6 feet at low water, divides the passage into two channels, through which the tide rushes into the Little Swinge with great velocity. The Emprone Reef, N.N.E. 3 cables from the Great Nannel, is lh cables long East and West by three quarters of a cable wide ; it has four rocks which uncover, the highest 2 feet, and other rocks awash. The sea breaks furiously on this reef, especially with fresh north westerly winds. Round Rock dries 9 feet midway betwreen the Nannels and the Emprone.

Its narrowest part is included in the space bounded by the rocks fringing the southern shore of Burhou island on the one side, and by the Barsier and Corbet rocks on the other. It is here only three quarters of a mile wide, but, when past these rocks in either direction, it soon widens. The bottom is rocky throughout and very uneven ; the average depth at its narrowest part is about 10 fathoms. There are several dangerous rocks, presently described, in the Swinge, and there is much broken water, even in the calmest weather, caused by the rapidity of the stream over the rugged bottom. There are also two overfalls, caused solely by the tide, of which the danger is much increased in bad weather. During easterly winds, on the north-eastern stream, overfalls extend nearly across from Burhou island to the outer end of Alderney break water. With westerly winds, on the south-western stream, they extend from the Ortac rock to the Etacs. Both may be avoided by following the directions hereafter given. See pages 327, 328. DANGERS in the SWINGE.\u2014 Approaching the Swinge from the south-westward, besides the Ortac rock and other dangers already described on the northern side, are also the Boues des Kaines and North rock, with other rocks in-shore of them adjacent to Burhou island ; near the centre of the entrance is the Pierre au Vraic, with Richards and Ellis rocks to the eastward ; and, on the southern side of the channel, bordering the coast of Alderney, are the EtacB banks, South rock, and the Barsier and Corbet rocks, before mentioned as being at the narrowest part of the Swinge, besides many other rocks and ledges closer in-shore. Boues des Kaines. \u2014 The outer head of these rocks is awash at low water ; it lies S.S.W. \u00a3 W. 3 cables from the high water rocky mass at the south-western end of Burhou reef ; from it, Fort Albert flagstaff just inside the outer end of Grosnez fort bears E. by S. \\ S. ; and, Long rock a little open westward of the south-western rocky mass of Burhou reef N.N.E. \\ E. easterly.

Pierre au Vraic. \u2014 This dangerous rock, which dries 5 feet at low spring tides, is immediately in the stream of the Swinge channel ; from it, the Casquets lighthouse bears N.W. 4 W. 4 miles ; the Ortac rock N. \u00a3 E. 1 miles ; and, the outer and highest of the Etacs, near the western end of Alderney, E. \\ N. 1\u00a3 miles. In form and size this rock is like a small boat bottom up, and it is surrounded by deep water ; at 1^ cables both southward and westward of it there are 26 fathoms, and within that distance, as also in-shore of it, from 14 to 16 fathoms. The marks for the Pierre au Vraic are, the inner peak of Great Coque Lihou on with the Coupe rock E. by S. 4 S. ; and, the conical beacon on the slope of the high land just within Fort Tourgis on with the beacon in Clonque fort E. by N. northerly ; these marks are also used to clear the rock on either side. Tourgis beacon on with northern end of Clonque fort leads 2 cables northward of the Pierre au Vraic. By night, Cape de la Hague light opening and shutting in with the southern end of Alderney also leads close northward of it. Richards and Ellis Rocks are on a rocky bank rather more than half a mile south-eastward of the Pierre au Vraic, and are 2\\ cables distant from each other. Richards rock has 5\u00a3 fathoms water, and there are 23 fathoms within a cable southward of* it ; from the rock, the outer Coque Lihou a little open northward of the inner Noire Pute bears E. \u00a3 S. ; and, the Great Nannel just within the outer eastern high rock on Burhou N.E. by N. northerly. Ellis rock bears N. 4 W. 2\\ cables from Richards rock ; it appears, however, to have nothing less than 85 fathoms water. The Great Nannel on with the eastern end of Burhou leads a third of a mile eastward of these rocks. Large ships should not pass between Richards rock and the Pierre au Vraic. The Etacs Bank is nearly half a mile W.N.W. from the Etacs rocks ; the least known depth, 26 feet, is near the southern end. To pass outside this bank, keep the Great Noire Pute open westward of the Coupe rock until the Great Nannel is over the eastern end of Burhou island, or until Tourgis beacon comes near the northern end of Clonque fort."], [348, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C.

There is another head with 5^ fathoms at the western end of this same rocky bank ; it bears from South rock S.W. by W. \\ W. 2\\ cables. Both of these heads may have less water than is here given ; in approaching them from the westward, it is useful to remember that you cannot pass over the western head so long as the Great Noire Pute is in sight westward of the Etacs ; and, proceeding eastward, you are clear of the eastern head when the whole of the Great Noire Pute is eastward of the inner rock of the Etacs. Barsier Reef is a dangerous rocky group northward of the Clonque rock, from which it bears N. by W. 4 cables. The eastern heads of the Barsier dry 5 feet, and the western head is just awash at low water, springs. The eastern head of the highest Barsier bears S.W. by W. \\ W. 2 cables from the Corbet rock ; the western head of the reef is on the same bearing three quarters of a cable from its eastern head. The eastern head of the outer Noire Pute on with the western end of Alderney S. \\ W. westerly, clears the western side of the Barsier reef by half a cable ; and, Fort Albert flagstaff on with the flagstaff of Grosnez fort E. \u00a3 S. leads clear of its northern side about the same distance, but directly over the reef in-shore of the Corbet rock. Corbet Rock is half a mile N. by E. easterly from Clonque fort, and N.W. by W. \\ W. half a mile from Tourgis point ; it is never wholly covered, though at very high springs it is awash. There is a small detached rock outside the Corbet which dries at low water ; it is 40 yards distant, with the Corbet rock and Tourgis fort in line. The Corbet is attached to Alderney by a dangerous low-water ledge of rocks, and both tidal streams run over this ledge with great rapidity. The long western mark for the Corbet is, the north-eastern Casquets tower a little open southward of the Ortac rock W. by N. | N. ; and, the southern extreme of the Casquets just shut in with the southern cide of the Ortac leads northward of the Corbet and through the narrows of the Swinge. Between the Corbet and the eastern end of Burhou the streams rush with great velocity, and during a weather tide the sea breaks nearly across the Swinge ; the smoothest water then is generally near the Corbet. Other rocks and shoals nearer in-shore off the north-western and northern coasts of Alderney are fully described at page 334."], [349, "Chap, vie] SWINGE CHANNEL. \u2014 TIDAL STREAM. 327 DIRECTIONS\u2014 From the Southward through the Swinge. \u2014 Steer for the south-western end of Alderney, and, on approaching the Pierre au Vraic, be careful to open Tourgis beacon northward of Clonque fort, in order to pass northward of it ; or, to pass inside and southward of the Pierre au Vraic, bring Clonque fort on with the western end of the Etacs until the Great Nannel just within the eastern end of Burhou bears N.N.E. \u00a3 E., which marks lead eastward of Richards rock and outside the Etacs bank and the Boues des Etacs; proceed with the latter leading mark until Fort Albert flagstaff is on with the flagstaff in Grosnez fort ; the vessel is then northward of the South rock and of Barsier reef, and may round the Corbet rock at the distance of a cable if desired. After passing the Corbet, a course may be shaped out into the English Channel or for Alderney harbour, bearing in mind that more than one third of the breakwater at its outer end has now been washed away and forms a dangerous submerged reef, see page 331, for which a good clearing mark is, the Ortac rock seen between Noir Houmet and Burhou island ; the chief dangers southward of this line are the Jumelles rocks, described at page 335. Large ships should pass westward of the Pierre au Vraic and up through the middle of the Swinge, on the western side of the South rock bank and lj or 2 cables northward of Corbet rock, along which route nothing less than 8 fathoms will be met with, clearing the outlying rocks in passing by the marks just given in describing those dangers. By Night, it is useful to remember that the Casquets light is eclipsed by the Ortac rock when bearing W. by N. \\ N. northerly ; the line of eclipse on the southern side of the Ortac passes nearly a cable northward of the Corbet rock ; the Casquets light is seen again on the northern side of the Ortac at the distance of 1^ cables northward of the Corbet rock. THE TIDAL STREAM must be carefully considered and allowed for in navigating the Swinge. The first of the eastern stream sets on Alderney, but, after high water, it turns off to the northward and north-westward. Therefore, entering the Swinge from the southward on the first of this stream, it is advisable under ordinary circumstances to pass westward of the Pierre au Vraic, and, eastward of it, at the latter part of the tide ; in thick weather, however, the Alderney shore should be closed with, but cautiously at all times, and the vessel anchored on or near the Orbouee bank or in the West bay"], [350, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. 328 anchorage until clear enough to proceed, see page 342. No vessel should attempt to pass through the Swinge with the tide in foggy weather, for, at springs, the stream runs from 7 to 8 knots, and under such circumstances it is evident that, should a vessel come suddenly into danger, her destruction would be inevitable. The strength of the stream in the Swinge\u2014 that is, between Burhou island and the Corbet rock \u2014 sets straight through both ways at high and low water ; like the stream in the Casquet channel, it begins to set south-westward at half ebb exactly, and runs in that direction for 6 hours, or until half flood ; and, the contrary is the case with the north-eastern stream. Westward of the Narrows, a branch of the north-eastern stream sets through between Burhou island and the Ortac rock, especially after high water by the shore ; and, eastward of the Narrows, it curves round the Emprone to the north-westward, where both branches uniting with the Casquets channel tides, and ultimately with that of the English Channel, again set eastward. The last two hours of the south-western stream in the Swinge gradually veers towards the South as it recedes from the draught of the Swinge passage. The average velocity of the north-eastern stream during springs is 7\u00a3 miles ; that of the south-western stream, 6| miles per hour. When passing through the Swinge from the northward, on the first of the south-western stream, proceed along the Alderney shore, past the Etacs, and eastward of the Pierre au Vraic. After low water, keep Burhou island and the Ortac rock aboard, taking care to clear the North rock and Boues des Kaines, and making due allowance for the set of the south-eastern stream, which will be met with after clearing the Casquet banks. In westerly gales, it is particularly necessary to take the above prescribed routes to avoid the overfalls, which shift their positions through a regular course according to the direction of the stream. At such times, the Swinge is only navigable by steam-vessels of large size and power, and even then at some risk. Vessels from the northward and eastward, as well as those from Alderney, bound to Guernsey or Jersey during westerly gales, should endeavour to push through the Race or Swinge channels directly the north-eastern stream begins to slack, the sea being then comparatively smooth ; for, as the south-western stream makes against the gale, so does the sea rise and become dangerous ; and, as during the strength of this stream both the Race and Swinge channels are covered with broken water and highly dangerous, it is recommended at such times that vessels anchor in Alderney harbour, and there wait for a tide or for a lull in the gale."], [351, "Chap, vil.] TIDAL STREAM. \u2014 ALDERNEY ISLAND. 329 ALDERNEY or AURIGNY ISLAND,* is 3| miles long, East and West, by 14 miles wide at the widest part, which is near the western end. The Rond But, one third from the western end, is 306 feet above the sea, and is the highest part of the island, though the hill on which the windmill stands, half a mile westward of it, is nearly the same height, and at the old telegraph tower the land is only 10 feet lower. Alderney may be seen in clear weather at the distance of 22 miles ; its eastern extreme bears W. by N. f N. nearly 8 miles from Cape ,de la Hague lighthouse ; and, E. by S. \\ S. 8j miles from the Casquets.

The southern and western coasts are high precipitous cliffs, intersected by narrow valleys and fronted by outlying rocks, among which the most conspicuous are the Coque Lihou and Noire Putes groups to the southward, and the Etacs and Clonques to the westward ; the latter are crowned by a fort, which commands the Swinge channel. The northern and eastern sides are not nearly so high, and the coast consists of a series of bays of sand and gravel separated from each other by steep projecting points ; but, with the exception of the small bays of Braye, enclosed by the breakwater which forms Alderney harbour, Plate Saline, and Corblets, the intervals of beach are inaccessible, on account of the outlying rocks, which forbid all approach. The heights along the southern and western coasts are covered with heath and furze, but the interior is generally cultivated and fertile. There are but few trees on the island, and these only in the valleys near the town, where the neighbouring hills afford some shelter from the wind. St. Anne, the town of Alderney, is near the middle of the island ; it is well built, paved, and lighted with gas ; it has a large and hand some church, St. Anne's, besides several chapels. In addition to the town, villages sprang up at Craby, Braye new town, and Mannez, during the progress of the breakwater and forts, for the convenience of those engaged on the public works and at the quarries. Alderney has no dock accommodation nor any facilities for the repairs of shipping or for coaling steamers, no stock of coal, in fact, being kept for that purpose. Its trade in 1886 was represented by 223 vessels entering the port during the year, of an aggregate tonnage of 23,904 tons, besides which 204 passing vessels took refuge under its breakwater. The island abounds with springs of excellent water. Fuel is imported from England, and cattle for fresh meat from * See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Alderney and the Casquets, No. 60 ; scale m=i inches."], [352, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. 330 Cherbourg ; these necessaries are nevertheless to be obtained almost at the same prices as at Guernsey, owing to the regular steam communication now existing between Alderney, Cherbourg, and Guernsey. Stone is occasionally exported to England, and the island is in telegraphic communication with Jersey by cable from its south western end, and thus with England and France. Until the building of the breakwater, Alderney possessed but two small insecure harbours, both of which dry at low water neaps, viz., Longy bay or Baie du Catel, on the south-eastern side of the island, and the old artificial harbour of Braye on the northern side. Alderney forms part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and is included in the military command of the Lieutenant-Governor of that island ; it forms one parish under the patronage of the Crown, named St. Anne, of which the area is 1,962 imperial acres at high water, springs. The land was originally divided into small parcels among the in habitants, but the Government has purchased about a third of it for public works. The Civil Government or States consists of a judge appointed by the Crown, six jurats, and twelve douzeniers, who are elected by the inhabitants. In 1881, the population of Alderney, exclusive of the military, was 1,522, a great decrease having taken place consequent on the completion of the large Government works which had been so many years in progress. The ordinary garrison consists of a battery of Royal Artillery, besides the island militia, who are organized as artillery and reported to be very efficient. The forts along the northern, eastern, and south eastern shores of Alderney form a great feature in the appearance of the island on those sides ; of them, Fort Albert is the most conspicuous, standing on the crown of a remarkable conical hill which rises from the comparatively low land at the north-eastern part of the island. The Approach to Alderney on every side but from the north eastward, is dangerous from the numerous outlying rocks ; and, the dangers of the navigation are greatly intensified by the strength of the tidal streams ; therefore, a stranger should close with the island only on its north-eastern side, from which direction Alderney harbour may be approached and entered by attending carefully to the directions given. ALDERNEY HARBOUR, on the northern shore of Alderney, as originally formed by the breakwater, enclosed the old harbour of Braye, as well as the anchorage in the road fronting it, and also the harbour of Craby, which latter was built chiefly to shelter the"], [353, "Chap. VII.] ALDERNEY HARBOUR. \u2014 BREAKWATER. 331 vessels employed in laying the foundations of the breakwater and other Government works. The rocks encumbering the harbour were removed, and the anchorage rendered clear ; but, on account of the rocky nature of the bottom, vessels using their own anchors had always to ride with a good scope of cable when there was much wind. The harbour afforded good shelter from all but easterly winds, which sent in much sea.* The BREAKWATER was commenced in 1847 and completed m 1870 ; as constructed, it extended from Grosnez point straight for 1,000 yards N. 74\u00b0 E., when it curved northward for 173 yards, with a radius of 500 yards, and from thence straight to the end N. 54\u00b0 E. for a further distance of 436 yards. It was built on an artificial bank of rubble stone or pierres perdues, the main part being 40 feet wide, and 6 feet above high water, springs. Unfortunately, the strength of the breakwater has proved unequal to the requirements of the position, and its partial destruction, commenced during a violent gale from the eastward on the night of 8th January 1879, has gone on until by May 1887, the whole of the outer part, for an extent of 642 yards, had disappeared, leaving the inner part standing for a distance of 967 yards from fort Grosnez, the present visible end above water terminating so abruptly as to be easily mistaken by a stranger, unaware of the destruction that has taken place, for a finished end, and thus con stituting a great danger should the clearing marks not be made out, or be carelessly disregarded. The outer submerged portion now forms a reef visible in parts at low water, of which the most conspicuous portion is about 1,300 yards from fort Grosnez, or about 330 yards from its present outer end. The value of the harbour as a refuge is necessarily greatly impaired by the destruction which has taken place, but it has been decided that its repair shall not be undertaken. At the inner end of the breakwater there is a slipway for boats and small vessels, with steps at the lower end descending to the level of low water, springs ; there is also a flight of landing steps on the inner side 930 yards from the shore, and therefore close to its present visible outer end. The inner part of the breakwater is provided at short intervals with iron ladders from low water to the quay level ; in order that large ships might lie alongside, it was originally provided with mooring chains and bollards, but the destruction of so large a portion has rendered that impossible. Moorings. \u2014 One set of 1st class moorings is laid down under * See Admiralty plan : \u2014 Alderney harbour, No. 2,845 ; scale m = 18 inches."], [354, "332 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C [Chap. VII. shelter of the breakwater. In May 1887 it was less than 1^ cables from the existing outer end. As before remarked, the rocks inside the Breakwater were for the most part removed by blasting ; of these, the Tetes Champignons N.W. by W. three quarters of a cable from Roselle point now have 16 feet water. Another group W. by S. 2 cables from Roselle point now have 12 feet over them ; and, at the position of a former half tide rock there are 22 feet water. The Aiguillons rocks are eastward of those removed by blasting. They consist of a group of eight heads which dry at low water ; the Great Aiguillon, the easternmost rock, is N.N.E. h E. 1^ cables from Bibette head. The Small Aiguillon is the outer or northernmost of the group and bears due West nearly half a cable from the Great Aiguillon. A beacon turret was erected on this latter rock, but it was washed away during the winter of 1886-1887 and is not to be replaced. A dangerous reef of sunken rocks, with from 10 to 6 feet water, extends two thirds of a cable northward of the Great Aiguillon ; it may be cleared on the western side by keeping the flagstaff in Fort Albert open westward of the Small Aiguillon when that rock is uncovered ; and, the same rock on with the outer Grois rock E. by N. \\ N. leads clear of a 16-feet rock off Bibette head. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed red lights are exhibited at the head of the harbour to mark the fairway channel by night ; the lower light is visible in clear weather 5 miles, and is exhibited through a long tube which screens it in every direction except on a line through the middle of the fairway ; this light is shown from a white tower on the parapet of the old pier at Braye and is 25 feet above high water, springs. The upper light is exhibited from a pillar on the site of the old lecture room S.W. \u00a3 W. 370 yards from the lower light ; it is 55 feet above high water, and visible in clear weather from a distance of 9 miles. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Alderney harbour at 6 h. 46 m.; mean springs rise 11 \\ feet ; neaps rise 12\u00a3 feet ; neaps range 8 feet. Braye Old Harbour, within Alderney harbour, is formed by a sheltering pier projecting in an easterly direction from the western side of Braye bay ; it dries at low water, neaps, and was very insecure before the breakwater was built ; even now it is very inferior to the little harbour of Craby."], [355, "Chap. VII.] BRAYE AND CRABY HARBOURS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 333 The best time to enter Braye harbour is on a rising tide between half flood and high water ; at low water, there is a depth of 8 feet between the iron beacons placed one on either side of the entrance on the two rocky masses just outside the pier-head. The western beacon has a circular eye on the top ; the eastern one, a cross. No leading mark is required, but the pier-head should be rounded as closely as possible. Craby Harbour, also within Alderney harbour, was constructed by the Government in 1850, in the creek between Braye old harbour and Grosnez point. In addition to the shelter of the breakwater, this harbour is protected by two small piers having an entrance between the pier-heads 40 feet wide and open to the North-east. This harbour is 100 yards long from West to East, and 90 yards wide ; it affords 230 yards of quay frontage, sufficient to berth four colliers of about 150 tons burthen ; it dries out to the pier-heads at low water, springs, and at half tide there are 9 feet between the pier-heads. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 From the north-eastward, in hazy weather, it is prudent to obtain a bearing of cape de la Hague, when a vessel may stand boldly for the north-eastern end of the island ; but, to avoid the outlying rocks, should the weather be so thick that land cannot be discerned at the distance of 2 miles, neither the cape nor the island should be approached within that distance. When nearing either the cape or the island, the tides must be care fully considered, especially during the south-western stream, as it sets strongly over the Blanchard and Brinchetaie ledge ; and, it may be useful to note that on nearing the eastern end of Alderney, the Great Coque Lihou rock open south-eastward of the island keeps a vessel in the stream of the Race, and the Casquets light open north ward of Burhou island keeps her in the Swinge or Channel stream. See also page 348 for approaching the harbour entrance when coming from the south-westward round the eastern end of the island. In clear weather, a vessel may stand direct for the island. The leading mark into the harbour can then be seen 5 or 6 miles distant ; it is, the tower of St. Anne's church on with the pier-head of Braye old harbour S.W. 4. W. westerly ; and, to clear the outer end of the submerged portion of the breakwater, vessels from the northward or westward rounding the breakwater must be careful to keep the beacon on King's battery wall well open eastward of the Hornet des Pies beacon until the leading mark for the harbour comes on."], [356, "334 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. CAUTION. \u2014 It is necessary to repeat, and the special attention of the mariner is drawn to the fact, that the present visible end of the breakwater terminates so abruptly as to resemble a finished end. Vessels unaware of the destruction that has taken place, and rounding the breakwater without paying strict attention to the marks and directions given, run the risk of almost certain destruction on the submerged portion, which extends 642 yards beyond the present visible end. The strength of the west-going tide, especially at springs, also sets directly on to the submerged end for about 9 hours out of 12, which is an additional reason for the closest attention being given to the leading marks. It need scarcely be added that a vessel should be always ready for anchoring promptly in case of necessity. See also Tidal streams, page 344. When the eastern stream is running, the submerged end of the breakwater may be safely passed by keeping the beacon on King's battery wall on with the beacon on Hornet des Pies. By night, on account of the strength of the tides in this neigh bourhood, no vessel should attempt ito enter unless in charge of a pilot or of some person with good local .knowledge. The leading mark is, the harbour red lights in line bearing S.W. \u00a3 W. ; run in on this line, making careful allowance for the set of the tide. From the northward and westward, do not bring the Casquets light northward of West until the harbour lights are in line, and, on approaching the harbour, be very particular to have them exactly in line before shutting in the Casquets light with Burhou island, when a vessel will be close up to the submerged end of the breakwater. Near high or low water, springs, the stream sets across the entrance of the harbour with great velocity, and great caution is then necessary in entering. To ensure avoiding the rocky patches outside the Aiguillons on the one side, and the toe of the breakwater on the other, the bearing of the upper light should on no account be altered more than a quarter of a point on either side, and the lower light never lost sight of. If not desirous of using the Government moorings, anchor in about 5 fathoms, with the high light open northward of the low one. DANGERS N.W. and NORTH of ALDERNEY.\u2014 The outer dangers in these directions have been included in the description of the Swinge channel, see page 325, &c, those nearer the shore are the following : \u2014 The Etacs, the most remarkable of all the rocks near the western end of the island, with itheir off-lying shoals, form the southern"], [357, "Chap. VII.] DANGERS N.W. AND NORTH OP ALDERNEY. 335 boundary of the Swinge channel. They consist of a group of four ; the highest is 128 feet above high water ; the centre of the group is 2 cables from the shore off the western end of Alderney. The Boues des Etacs extend W.N.W. 1| cables from the outer Etac ; their north-western head has only one foot water. The eastern end of the outer Noire Pute on with the western end of the Coupe leads half a cable westward of them ; and, the northern or low part of Tourgis fort on with the southern part of Clonque fort leads the same distance northward. The Clonques are three high rocks attached to the western shore of Alderney by a rocky ridge uncovered at low water ; on this ridge, there has been constructed a roadway to communicate with Clonque fort, which fort stands on the two rocks nearest the land. A wooden beacon stands in the rear of the fort, on the south-eastern head of the Clonque. Platte Boue, Founiais, and Ozard Rock, are off the Clonques on about a W. \\ S. line of bearing from the fort ; the Platte Boue is close to the main reef ; the Founiais, which dries 6 feet, nearly 2 cables from the fort ; and, Ozard Rock, on which there are 4 feet water, nearly 3 cables from it. Ozard Rock is very small ; from it, the western end of the great Noire Pute just open eastward and clear of the inner rock of the Etacs bears S. \u00a3 E. ; and, Tourgis beacon on with the northern tangent of Clonque fort E. \u00a3 N. Querouelles Rocks. \u2014 The outer edge of this reef bears N.N.W. 4 W. 2\\ cables from Clonques fort, and is nearly 2 cables southward of the Barsier reef, already described, with from 4 to 8 fathoms water between them. The Querouelles dry 8 feet at low water, springs. Caution. \u2014 There is no safe passage inside the Querouelles and Barsier reefs, even for boats, and the first of the flood sets right on them ; at this time, therefore, a wide berth should be given them in passing. The Grosse, a large and prominent rock 14 feet above high water, springs, is steep-to and may be approached within half a cable. It lies E. S. 4 cables from the Corbet ; and, North 2 cables from Tourgis point. The Jumelles are two small ridges of rock which uncover at half tide East 8 cables from the Corbet, and 3 cables from the shore of Platte Saline bay."], [358, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C [Chap. VII. 336 Braye Rocks are a group of four heads, of which the outermost seldom covers though awash at high water, springs ; the three others, named the Follets, show at half tide. The outer Braye lies N.E. \\ E. 2\u00a3 cables from the outer angle of Grosnez fort and a cable from the breakwater. A rock with only Z\\ feet water lies E.N.E. one third of a cable from the outer Braye. DANGERS N.E. OF ALDERNEY.\u2014 The principal dangers on the north-eastern side of Alderney besides the sunken rocks north-eastward of the Aiguillons, included in the description of Alderney harbour, see page 332, are the Grois, the Platte, the Ledge, and the Sauquet. Grois Ledge is an extensive and dangerous reef off Etoc point ; it extends 2^ cables between the bearings N. by E. and N.E. from the tower of the fort on that point, which fort should not be approached on these bearings within half a mile. The outer Grois, a peaked rock, and the highest of the reef, is awash at high water, springs, and bears N by E. \\ E. easterly 2\\ cables from the flagstaff of the fort. Several heads show at half tide and many more at low water. The stream rushes over this reef with great velocity. The depth is 13^ feet 1\\ cables W.N.W. of the outer Grois, and the Boues briees, awash at low water, are half a cable eastward of the Grois ledge. The Ortac rock and Noir Houmet in line and well open of the breakwater W. \u00a3 N. leads half a cable outside the ledge. Platte Rock, S.E. \u00a3 E. easterly 3| cables from the outer Grois. uncovers 4 feet. From it, the Ortac just open northward of Etoc point bears W. by N. ; and, the Bon-Ami, the high rock on the eastern side of Corblets bay, on with old Corblets barracks S.W. 4 S. southerly. The ground between the Platte and the outer extreme of the Grois reef is foul and should not be approached by any vessel. The Ledge, or Fosse de la Bande, is a reef of considerable extent, with 13 feet water. It bears E. by S. two thirds of a mile from the outer Grois rock, with that rock on with the Ortac W. \u00a3 N. northerly ; and, the Honore, a high conical shore rock at the western end of the Mannez quarries, on with the small round tower of the barracks on Essex hill. The long western mark to clear the dangers off the north-eastern shore of Alderney is, the Casquet towers open northward of Burhou island W. by N."], [359, "Chap. VII.] DANGERS N.E., E., AND S.E. OF ALDERNEY. 337 Sauquet Rock, 2 cables southward of the Ledge and 1^ cables north-eastward of Homeaux Florains reef, on which is a small fort, uncovers 3 feet at low water, springs, with the tower of Etoc fort on with the Ortac rock W. by N. Great Nannel on with Grois rock W.N.W. leads just northward of it. The outer Grois rock and the north-eastern point of Burhou island in line lead between the Ledge and the Sauquet. The south-western stream running down towards Alderney divides in the vicinity of the Sauquet rock, one part running through the Race of Alderney, the other through the Swinge ; its tendency is to throw vessels near the Sauquet rock right on it. A berth should therefore be given it of 3 or 4 cables. DANGERS E. and S.E. of ALDERNEY.\u2014 The principal dangers off the eastern side of the island are the Brinchetaie ledge, the Boufresses, and the Blanchard ; and, south-eastward of port Longy, the Race and Inner Race rocks and other rocky patches. The Brinchetaie is a dangerous group of rocks forming a ledge extending south-eastward from Houmet Herbe, off the eastern point of Alderney. The outer tidal rock is 3 cables from the shore and uncovers 11 feet ; the inner rock uncovers 16 feet. Several shoals, awash at low water, equinoctial springs, extend south-eastward of these rocks as far as one third of a mile from the coast. Raz island flagstaff on with the southern extreme of Essex castle ; or, the high Noire Pute, inner Coque Lihou, and southern side of the Etac de la Quoire in line bearing W. by S., leads southward of the Brinchetaie ; and, the outer part of Quenard fort on with the inner part of Homeaux Florains fort leads eastward. Boufresses Reef is nearly 4 cables westward of the Brinchetaie and closer in-shore, its outer end being 1\u00a3 cables eastward of Raz island fort ; it uncovers to a considerable extent at low water. Raz island flagstaff on with the middle of Essex castle leads southward. Blanchard Bank is composed of rock, gravel, granite stones, and shells. At its western extreme, which bears E. by S. 6 cables from Houmet Herbe fort, there is a mass of rock with only 2\u00a3 fathoms water ; from thence, the bank extends 2 cables, in the same direction, to the Blanchard rock with only 12 feet water, which lies at the eastern edge of the bank, nearly three quarters ot a mile from Houmet Herbe. Between its western end and the rocks nearer the shore off the eastern end of the island, there are from 9 to A. 2771. Wt. 17197. Y"], [360, "CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. 338 12 fathoms water. The Blanchard is very dangerous, especially at its eastern extreme, which rises quite suddenly from soundings of 20 and 25 fathoms, causing, during springs, eddies and a heavy sea on a weather tide. Race and Inner Race Rocks.\u2014 Three unconnected rocky patches lie south-eastward of Longy bay, stretching off from the tails of the Brinchetaie and Blanchard at the several distances of half a mile, 9 cables, and 1\u00a3 miles from the latter. On the Race and Inner Race rocks, the two outermost, there are only 18 feet water, and 4i fathoms on the patch nearest the Blanchard, which bears no special name. From the Race rock, the old telegraph tower is three times its own length open southward of the Etac de la Quoire ; and, Doyle's column, Guernsey, is nearly on with the Grande Amfroque, a very distant mark only to be distinguished in the clearest weather. From the Inner Race rock, St. Anne's mill is twice its own length open southward of the Rousset rock ; and, from the northern patch, St. Anne's mill is on with the southern angle of Essex fort. Clearing Marks. \u2014 To pass southward of the Brinchetaie, Boufresses, and Blanchard rock, and northward of the Race and Inner Race rocks and of the 4^-fathoms rocky patch, keep the high Noire Pute, inner Coque Lihou, and base of the Etac de la Quoire in line W. by S. To pass northward of the Blanchard, the mark is, Grois rock on with the Great Nannel W.N.W.; or, if near high water when the Grois rock is not easily distinguished, the north-eastern extreme of Chateau de l'Etoc just open northward of the Homeaux Florains. Doyle's column just open northward of the northernmost bluff land on Herm S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. leads well southward of all these rocks, as does also cape de la Hague lighthouse not brought southward of East, or the Casquets lighthouse kept in sight southward of Alderney. SOUTH COAST OF ALDERNEY. \u2014 Longy Bay, or Baie du Catel, is on the south-eastern side of Alderney and dries at low water, neaps ; it affords but little shelter except to small coasting vessels capable of taking the ground, and, since the con struction of Alderney harbour, is but seldom used. The entrance is between Raz island, on which there is a fort, and the Queslingue rock. The distance between these points is less than 2 cables, and this small space is divided into two entrances of equal width by a rock in the centre, which dries 2 feet ; moreover, both tides set"], [361, "Chap. VII.] 339 SOUTH COAST OP ALDERNEY. violently across the entrance of the bay, therefore no stranger should attempt to enter it unless compelled to do so, when the following directions should be observed. Directions. \u2014 The best time to enter Longy bay is with the wind between N.W. and S.W., and between 2 and 5 hours ebb ; a vessel may then run aground, and on the succeeding tide she may be hauled up under Essex nunnery on the sandy beach at the western side of the bay. The leading mark in with these winds is, the Nunnery just shut in by the land westward of Queslingue rock N. \\ E. until near the rock, and then by rounding its rocky point within half a cable, the fairway sunken rock in the entrance is avoided. Longy road off Longy bay affords good shelter from northerly and north-westerly winds in from 10 to 14 fathoms, sand, gravel, and shells. Anchor with the whole of Fort Albert just shut in with, and seen over, the western point of Longy bay N. by W. \\ W.; and, the Grande Folie rocky peak just open eastward of Raz island fort N.E. \\ N. This berth is in about 9 fathoms, 1\\ cables from the shore. A better anchorage and more out of the tide may be found off the middle of Tchue bay, just westward of the Rousset rock ; anchor here in 7 or 8 fathoms H cables westward of the Rousset, with the western side of Raz fort touching the eastern side of Queslingue rock. The Roque Pendante is a remarkable overhanging rock on the summit of the bluff, within the Rousset rock, and south-westward of Essex castle ; it may be seen from a distance of 9 or 10 miles on an easterly or westerly bearing, but on altering the bearing on either side it soon shuts in with the island and can only be distinguished from a very short distance. Queslingue and Rousset rocks are high and peaked ; they are within 2 cables East and West of each other and close to the shore. The Etac de la Quoire is about off the middle of the southern coast of the island, at half a cable only from the shore and connected with it at low water. It is a conical rock, about 60 yards in diameter and 106 feet above high water, or 10 feet lower than the Great Coque Lihou. Bonit Rock bears S. by W. h W. westerly 44 cables from the Etac de la Quoire. This dangerous rock is of small extent and Y 2"], [362, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. 340 uncovers only at low water, springs, having from 10 to 14 fathoms close to. The marks for it are, the Grande Folie eastward of Longy seen between the Rousset and Queslingue rocks N.E. \u00a3 E. ; and, the Etac de la Quoire on with a beacon on the adjoining shore N. by E. \\ E. ; the latter mark leading rather on the eastern side of the rock. The Bonit may be avoided by not approaching Alderney nearer than a mile, by keeping the Casquets in sight southward of the island, or by keeping the inner Noire Pute open southward of the outer Coque Lihou. Noire Roque, which is 15 feet above high water, bears N.W. 4. N. 34. cables from the Bonit and is 2 cables from the nearest shore ; it is exactly in line between the Etac de la Quoire and the great Coque Lihou ; it is steep-to all round, but has a 4-feet patch only a cable distant north-eastward, between it and the land. Alderney South Banks extend from the Bonit rock in a south-westerly direction more than 1^ miles ; the general depth on the main bank is 15 fathoms, gravel, from which as a base there arise seven small sand-banks, one with as little as 6 fathoms water. These small banks have sharp ridges, which lie in a N.E. and S.W. direction ; the largest is less than a quarter of a mile long. The shallow spots commence nearly 6 cables S.S.W. \u00a3 W. from the Bonit. A vessel from the eastward may pass inside them by keeping the Coupe rock a little open southward of the outer Coque Lihou, until the Grande Folie opens westward of Queslingue rock ; and, outside, by keeping the Verte-tete rock open westward of the outer Noire Pute N. by W. \\ W. westerly, until Grande Folie is on with Raz island fort N.E. \\ N. northerly. By night, the Casquets light N.W. \\ N. leads one mile south westward of Alderney South banks, and half a mile on the same side of the Pierre au Vraic. Cape de la Hague light kept bearing north ward of East also leads southward of Alderney South bank. Some of the heaviest overfalls in the Race are caused by these banks, which must therefore be avoided in bad weather. Coque Lihou Rocks are off the south-western end of Alderney, nearly a mile westward of the Etac de la Quoire, and a quarter of a mile from the shore. They consist of a group of three. The Great Coque Lihou, the middle and easternmost, is much larger and higher than either of the others, being 116 feet above high water ; it bears S.S.E. -\\ E. 6 cables from Alderney old telegraph tower. A bank of sand, extending 2\u00a3 cables eastward from the Great Coque Lihou, has on"], [363, "Chap. VII.] DANGERS OFF SOUTH COAST OF ALDERNEY. 341 it as little as 1^ fathoms. It makes a convenient anchorage for fishing boats and small craft in fine weather. There is a 5-fathoms channel inside the Coque Lihou rocks close to the Alderney shore ; it is only a cable wide and therefore not to be attempted by a stranger. Rocks awash at low water extend from the Coque Lihou rocks more than half way across to the Alderney shore ; and, a continuous sunken chain unites them to the Joyeux rocks, a scattered group extending W.N.W. about half a mile from the Coque Lihou rocks and north-eastward from the Noires Putes. The Noires Putes are a group of rocks, four in number, three of which are always uncovered ; the two outer rocks are much larger and higher than the others ; these lie East and West from each other and are rather more than a cable apart. The western rock is flat topped, and 55 feet above high water ; the eastern rock has a peak near its eastern end 76 feet high ; it is known as the Great Noire Pute, and bears S-W. by S. three quarters of a mile from the old telegraph tower. The group is quite steep-to on the outside. The Aiguillons, Coupe, and Orbouee, three rocks respectively 18, 22, and 6 feet above high water, lie between the Noires Putes and the Etacs, in a W.S.W. direction from each other, and half a mile from the south-western extreme of Alderney ; they form the southern boundary of the Fossee Malieres or West bay anchorage. The Coupe, the middle of the three, is sometimes called the Cocked hat, which it somewhat resembles in appearance ; it is one of the marks for the Pierre au Vraic. The Orbouee, the outer rock of the group, is awash at high spring tides ; it is connected with the Coupe under water, is steep-to on the southern and western sides, but has a rock with only 2 fathoms water one cable N.W. by N. from it. Orbouee Bank, extending S. by W. rather more than half a mile from Orbouee rock, consists of gravel, sand, and broken shells ; its general depths are 8 and 9 fathoms, but near its outer end there are only 3\u00a3 fathoms. This part rises from the main bank in a narrow ridge of fine sand, very difficult to pick up, and thrown up apparently by the turning of the stream. From the shoalest spot, the Great Nannel is a little open westward of the outer rock of the Etacs ; and the Etac de la Quoire is on with the northern part of the outer Noire Pute. The bank may be cleared by keeping the Pierres de But open westward of the Etacs N. by E.

VII. 342 Anchorage.\u2014 West bay.\u2014 The best anchorage at the western end of Alderney is in the Fossee Malieres or West bay ; anchor here in 9 or 10 fathoms, gravel, with the Great Nannel or with the Refuge on Burhou island touching the outer end of the Western Etac ; and, Great Coque Lihou open clear inside the Aiguillons S.E. by E. \u00a3 E., or the Great Noire Pute appearing midway between the Coupe and the Aiguillons. Here a vessel will lie out of the tide. There is anchorage also a quarter of a mile outside the Orbouee rock in 7 fathoms on a S.S.W. bearing from the rock, but it is exposed to the full force of the flood stream and therefore not safe. Tidal Streams.\u2014 The tidal stream round Alderney is subject to changes and variations very similar in character to those round Guernsey and Jersey, but with local peculiarities, arising principally from the more prominent position of Alderney on the edge of the true Channel stream, and also, in a great degree, from the different form of the island itself as compared with the others. At Alderney, as well as round Guernsey, the direction of the tidal stream revolves from East round by North to West and South, running from every pioint of the compass during one whole tide, an ebb and a flood. As at Guernsey, the stream attains its greatest strength about high and low water by the shore, but, as might be expected from the situation of Alderney, its direction at this time is different, coinciding more nearly with the Channel stream. Thus the strength of the stream, flood and ebb, on the northern side of Alderney and the Casquets, runs about E. i N. and W. \\ S. ; whilst round the Guernsey group, at the same time, its general direction is about E.N.E. and W.S.W. This change in direction may be considered as taking place on a line passing close northward of the Casquets, past the Nannels, north ward of Alderney and of cape de la Hague. A glance at the chart best illustrates how the north-eastern stream, after passing through the Race, Swinge, and Ortac channels, is turned in an easterly direction in uniting with the Channel flood stream ; also how, on the south-western stream, the Channel ebb stream running in a westerly direction past cape de la Hague, Alderney, and the Casquets, is deflected through the channels between these places in a more southerly direction. This description, however, only applies to the periods of high and low water; in its transition from one to the other, peculiarities occur requiring a more particular description. The North-eastern stream begins to make through the Race and Swinge channels when the tide has risen three hours, and it attains its greatest strength, 7 to 8 knots, about the time of high water by the"], [365, "Chap, vii.] TIDAL STREAMS ROUND ALDERNEY. 343 shore. An hour after high water, the stream, in the course of its rotary change of direction, is setting about N.E. by E. and begins to abate in strength, still veering in direction and slacking in strength ; at 3 hours after high water, it sets faintly to the N.W., causing a short slack in the Swinge, and also on the north-western side of Burhou, after which the south-western stream comes down and rushes through these channels with a velocity nearly as great as the flood or north eastern stream. After low water by the shore, the tide begins to veer to the southward and abate in strength ; an hour and a half after low water, the stream is setting from the northward on Alderney and Burhou, causing extensive slacks or eddies southward of these islands ; and, at half flood, the offing stream, now very weak, sets south-eastward, causing a dead slack for a short time in all the channels between Alderney and the Casquets. Having thus described the general course of the main tidal stream round Alderney, it is necessary to describe some of the most im portant eddies caused by the peculiar turning of the streams and the obstruction offered by islands and rocks. Alderney, the Casquets, and intermediate rocks, all narrow in propor tion to their length and each lying on a line of direction nearly East and West, are in the line of both tidal streams when at their strength ; therefore, at these times, the resistance they offer to the free course of the stream is small and the eddies under them insignificant ; but, as the stream in its rotary change of direction moves out of this line, extensive eddies or in-shore streams are formed under the lee of Alderney, alternately on its northern and southern shores. On the northern shore of Alderney, the in-shore stream commences at the Sauquet rock and extends -westward as far as the Corbet rock, and within that rock southward of the main channel of the Swinge, running 9 hours westward and only three eastward, the western stream commencing an hour before high water and the eastern stream at 2 hours flood. Along the southern side of the island, between Orbouee rock and Raz island, there are 9 hours of eastern and but 3 hours of western in-shore stream ; the eastern stream commences one hour before low water, and runs along the land towards Longy and beyond it during the whole flood and until 2 hours ebb. In the neighbourhood of Longy, meeting with the south-western stream of the Race, it suddenly veers and unites with it ; the western stream commences at 2 hours ebb and sets towards the Orbouee for 3 hours, or until 5 hours ebb, at which time it joins the south-western stream from the Swinge. The general courses and action of these two great eddies or in-"], [366, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C. [Chap. VII. 344 shore streams are exactly the reverse of each other. They may be easily understood by reference to a chart of Alderney and by careful perusal of the foregoing remarks ; but, as the northern eddy sets across the entrance of Alderney harbour, at times with great velocity, and then constitutes the principal danger in entering that harbour, a more particular description of its action will now be given. The direction of the eastern stream half an hour before high water, about which time it attains its greatest strength, is about East ; this being the line of direction of Alderney, it runs full on the western point of the island by which the stream is now fairly divided, one part rushing through the Race along the southern side of the island between 7 and 8 knots, the other through the Swinge at about the same rate, leaving a small eddy previously noticed under the eastern end of the island near the Sauquet rock. At high water by the shore, the turning of the offing stream from an easterly to a northerly direction relieves the pressure of the Swinge stream from the end of the breakwater ; and, at this time during a spring tide, the Swinge stream is running eastward at the rate of 3 knots 120 yards outside the breakwater, the intermediate space being occupied by the stream setting westward round the breakwater, also at the rate of 3 knots. This latter is the in-shore stream or eddy ; it commences in the eddy near the Sauquet rock, and begins to set westward, as before stated, an hour before high water. At this time, the western stream sets round the end of the breakwater, in volume a mere thread, but it gradually increases in magnitude as the turning of the offing stream removes the pressure of the Swinge stream from the breakwater. The most dangerous time in dealing with this tide and eddy is at about high water, when they set past each other, separated by only a few feet, at the rate just given ; great caution must therefore be used in taking a long vessel into harbour at this time. The breakwater obstructing the course of the western stream is the cause of the danger, and the stream is, of course, strongest near the outer end of that structure ; therefore, at high water, it is advisable to enter the harbour a little southward of the mid-channel course rather than risk a too near approach to the breakwater end. An hour after high water, the inner edge of the east-going Swinge stream is removed to the distance of 2 cables from the breakwater end, and both streams beginning to abate in strength, the danger gradually ceases.* * The destruction of the outer end of the breakwater in some degree modifies the conditions affecting this stream and eddy. To the mariner it should give rise to additional caution, in order to avoid being caught by the eddy on the port bow and set on to the submerged portion of the breakwater."], [367, "Chap. VII.] TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 BANC DE LA SCHOLE. 345 At 2 hours ebb, the Swinge stream, now slacking fast and veering westward, sets on the Nannels ; the western stream running past the end of the breakwater at the rate of three knots, meeting the eastern stream in the Swinge a little outside the Corbet rock, unites with it and both set towards the Nannels. Within the Corbet rock, the western stream sets down in-shore to the western end of the island. At half ebb by the shore, the offing tide is setting faintly north westward and there is slack water in the Swinge, but only for a few minutes, after which the westerly stream makes through the Swinge and immediately commences to run past the breakwater end with renewed strength until low water by the shore, gradually slacking as the offing stream veers from W. S. to the southward. Whilst the direction of the stream is veering through the latter section of its course, there is slack water at the entrance of Alderney harbour ; after a short interval, at 2 hours after low water, the stream sets across the end of the breakwater in an E.S.E. direction. BANC DE LA SCHOLE, 7 miles S.S.W. from Alderney, lies nearly in the direct line between the Great Russell channel and the Race of Alderney. Like most other banks between the Channel islands, it consists of a mixture of fine gravel, sand, and shells ; it is very steep-to on the southern and western sides but shoals gradually on the north-eastern side. Within the 5-fathoms line, it is 1^ miles long N. by E. and S. by W. and one third of a mile wide at its greatest width near the middle, tapering off to a mere ridge at the extremes. The 10-fathoms line includes a space 24, miles long N.N.E. and S.S.W. and three quarters of a mile wide, whilst the 20-fathoms line includes a length of 5 miles by 1^ miles. The top of the bank is very narrow and consists of small semi-circular ridges of sand convex to the S.W., over which the general depth is 3 fathoms at the lowest spring tides ; near the middle of the bank, however, as little as 2 fathoms has been found, with some spots close by of 2\\ fathoms. St. Martin's point, Guernsey, appearing midway between the Grande Fauconniere rock and the south-western end of Herm island, points to the shoalest spot. The soundings taken on this bank at different times tend to show that its higher parts are continually varying in altitude ; it is probable, therefore, that, within a limited space, it also shifts its position as influenced by tide, weather, &c. The position of the shoalest spot on the bank did not alter perceptibly, however, from 1861 to 1869 ; the marks for it are \u2014 Alderney old telegraph tower N. by E. \u00a3 E."], [368, "346 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, &C.

It must, however, be borne in mind that these marks are all distant and can only be made out in fine clear weather. Between low water and half flood, it is advisable to pass eastward of the Bane de la Schole ; but, between half ebb and low water, westward, because in both cases the tide favours the attempt. In bad weather, if the wind and tide are ever so obliquely opposed to each other, the sea breaks very dangerously on all parts of the bank. The RACE Of ALDERNEY is the strait between Alderney and cape de la Hague, deriving its name from the violence of the tidal streams through the strait. Here, as in the Swinge and Ortac channels, the stream sets south-westward at half ebb by the shore' and runs in that direction, with the variations presently given, for 6 hours, or until half flood; and, the contrary is the case with the north eastern stream, for there is but little slack water in the Race. The greatest strength of the south-western stream lasts for about 2\\ hours ; it begins 5 hours after high water at Alderney and ends 4| hours before the following high water. The greatest strength of the north-eastern stream continues about 2 hours ; that is, from one hour before high water at Alderney until one hour after. During equinoctial springs, the velocity of the south-western stream is nearly 7 knots, and of the north-eastern stream nearly 8 knots ; at neaps, 5J knots. The first 2\u00a3 hours of the south-western stream in the Race, from half ebb to low water, sets W.S.W. ; and, the last 2 hours, from low water to half flood, S.W.; and, the contrary for the first and last 'h\\ hours of the north-eastern stream, which, between half flood and high water, sets very strongly round cape de la Hague. There are therefore 5\u00b1 hours south-western and 6^ hours north eastern stream, that is, half an hour's difference between the Race tide and that in the Ortac and Swinge channels."], [369, "Chap, vii.] 347 ALDERNEY RACE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. In boisterous weather, if the wind and stream are ever so obliquely opposed, the sea breaks in all parts of the Race, as if it were over small knolls or patches, which makes it difficult and often dangerous for small vessels to pass through ; at such times, there are heavy overfalls over all the sunken rocks and banks, all of which must of course be carefully avoided. DANGERS in the RACE.\u2014 The Race rock, Inner Race rock, and Blanchard, described at pages 337, 338, have respectively 18, 18, and 12 feet water. There is a rocky 13-fathoms bank W. j S. 3 miles from cape de la Hague lighthouse, which, although not dangerous, throws up a strong overfall, and should be avoided. The fairway of the Race lies between this bank and the Race rock ; the distance between is 3\u00a3 miles ; the soundings in this, the narrowest part of the Race, are regular, between 22 and 24 fathoms, and the bottom rocky throughout. Middle Rock, or Milieu, an isolated head with 7 fathoms water lies S.S.E. \u00a3 E. 4\u00a3 miles from Alderney old telegraph tower ; from it, the Casquets bear N.W. \\ W. 9i miles ; and, cape de la Hague lighthouse E. by N. %\\ miles. When the tide is running strongly, the position of this rock is marked by a breaker or overfall, and there is at all times a ripple over it. The clearing marks given on the preceding page for the Bane de la Schole also clear the Milieu, and it may be easily avoided by attending to the directions given for passing through the Race. Another patch of 9 fathoms lies 2 miles S.W. by S. from the Middle rock, between it and the Bane de la Schole. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 When running through the Race of Alderney from the northward, if bound for the Deronte or Russell channels, it is at all times best to take the fairway of the channel described, bearing in mind that the north-eastern stream between half flood and high water by the shore sets very strongly round cape de la Hague, off which there project many sunken rocks, see page 184, 185 &c. Vessels bound for Granville, or other ports on the French shore in the Cotentin channel, round cape de la Hague more closely, clearing its rocks and shoals by the marks given at the pages referred to. The direct course from the Race to the Little Russell channel is about W.S.W.; and, from the Casquets, about S.S.W. \\ W.

After passing the Bonit rock, bring the high Noire Pute on with the Great Coque Lihou, which mark leads midway between the Inner Race and Blanchard rocks. When Fort Albert comes on with the Grande Folie, the high Noire Pute may be brought on with the Etac de la Quoire, and so kept until Etoc fort flagstaff opens northward of the fort on the Homeaux Florains, to clear the Blanchard, after which steer as required out into the Channel ; or, if bound for Alderney harbour, steer North until the Outer Grois rock is on with the Great Nannel W.N.W. to clear the Sauquet rock ; after which, steer about N.W. by N. until the Ortac rock is on with the southern extreme of Burhou W.

The Race of Alderney, especially as it affects vessels passing near the Alderney shore, and bound through the Deronte or Russell channels, is described at pages 346-348 ; and, as regards those bound for Granville or other ports by the Cotentin channel along the French shore, at pages 186-192. Directions to be observed on approaching cape de la Hague will now be given, and the description of the coast of France from cape de la Hague eastward will then be resumed.* Directions. \u2014 When approaching cape de la Hague from the south-westward, it should be borne in mind that the north-eastern stream of tide, between half flood and half ebb by the shore, sets very strongly round the cape. Flamanville church tower, however, seen exactly half way between the Nez de Jobourg and cape Flaman ville S. 4 E., until the Casquets open northward of Alderney, leads a sufficient distance westward of the cape to avoid all danger of being drawn by the stream, whether flood or ebb, amongst the rocks in its vicinity. Vessels from the eastward, coasting a little too near the shore between Cherbourg and cape de la Hague, are liable to be drawn into the Race of Alderney if they do not keep 7 or 8 miles from the coast when westward of Cherbourg.

In clear weather, these windmills may be seen from the masthead from abreast of St. Martin's bay. If overtaken by a calm, vessels should anchor if within 7 or 8 miles of the land. Pilots recommend a position in about 20 fathoms water, a little northward or north-eastward of the Mermistin rock, which rock is about a mile from the shore between Omonville and Querqueville point. Fosse de la Hague. \u2014 The soundings round cape de la Hague are very irregular, and the violent eddies in its vicinity during the north-eastern stream are caused by the great mass of water flowing over the rugged uneven bottom towards and round the cape. At three miles W. by N. N. from cape de la Hague lighthouse, com mences the western part of the Fosse de la Hague, which, from thence, trends E. \\ N. nearly 8 miles, its central part curving northward away from the cape and terminating 34, miles from the coast on the meridian of the eastern part of St. Martin's bay. The soundings throughout the whole extent of this deep are from 36 to 58 fathoms, its extreme width is less than a mile, and there are about 30 fathoms round it. The COAST. \u2014 The Cotentin peninsula, of which cape de la Hague is the north-western and cape Barfleur the north-eastern extreme, forms the narrowest part of the English Channel until the Straits of Dover are approached ; the Bill of Portland bearing N. \\ W. westerly, only 51 miles, and St. Catherine point, Isle of Wight, N.E. northerly 57 miles from cape de la Hague. The coast of France, after trending almost due North from the eastern shore of the Baie de Mont St. Michel, here makes an abrupt turn eastward, cape Barfleur bearing from cape de la Hague E.S.E. 27 miles, the coast between the two capes receding still more to the southward ; and, nearly midway between them, is the important naval station and arsenal of Cherbourg. The aspect of this line of coast, viewed from the northward, is that of a moderately elevated table-land, presenting an appearance of high cultivation. As the shore is neared, Cherbourg breakwater and forts are seen, and cape de la Hague itself then appears, low and sandy, though the land becomes high close at hand. This is also the case eastward of Cherbourg, and especially between cape Levi and cape Barfleur,"], [373, "Chap. VIII.] 351 THE COAST. \u2014 ANSE DE ST.

Basse du Houffet and Le Fliart.\u2014 From the Houffet rocks, about one mile eastward of Cape de la Hague, to the western point of St. Martin's bay, the coast is bordered by irregular rocks which uncover at low water, and off it are many shallow patches. The Basse du Houffet, the farthest out, is dangerous only on account of the high sea on it occasioned by the eddies ; it lies E. by S. h S. 6 cables from the Houffet rocks and has 5^ fathoms water over it. The Fliart, nearly a mile south-eastward of the Houffet rocks, and N.N.W. 2 cables from the Herbeuses, at the entrance of St. Martin's bay, is the principal rock of those which uncover along this part of the coast, its summit drying 11 feet above the level of the lowest tides. Shoal patches extend E. by N. 3 cables from the Fliart, and upon their outer extreme there are only 6 feet water. Buoy. \u2014 A red buoy is moored on the outer extreme of the Fliart shoal patches. ANSE de St. MARTIN.\u2014 This bay is 2 miles eastward of cape de la Hague, and is bounded on the eastern side by the high rocks of Martiauroc and Esquina, and on the western side by the Herbeuses. It is open to winds from N.W. to N.E. which throw in a heavy sea when they blow with any strength, but it is well sheltered from all other winds, especially those from the opposite quarters. The western point of the bay is the termination of a projecting range of hills, on the top of which stands the church of St. Germain de Vaux ; it may be easily known by the Herbeuses rocks, which are a prolongation of the point, as well as by a fort commanding the approach to a tolerably good anchorage E.S.E. and S.E. of the point, where small craft find shelter with the wind from W.N.W. round by West to S.S.E., but where they are greatly exposed if it blows strongly from the north-eastward. The Herbeuses are large rocks rising from 30 to 40 feet above high water, springs, and are joined to the western point of the bay by rocks which uncover and which extend N.N.E. 3 cables in a direct line from that point. The ground is foul round the Herbeuses, and shoal patches with only from one to 3 feet water, lie N.E., E.S.E., and S.S.E., H cables from their northern extreme."], [374, "352 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. Buoy. \u2014 A red buoy is moored on the N.E. extreme of the patches extending eastward of the Herbeuses. The western shore of the bay is precipitous and bordered by rocks which uncover at low water ; but, in its south-western angle, at the entrance of the valley of St. Germain de Vaux, there is a small beach of pebbles and gravel which covers at the first half hour's flood. A similar beach forms the head of the bay, and half way up the hill behind the beach stands the church and village of St. Martin. The eastern shore is low, but the adjoining land rises gently to the top of a spur of hills running out towards Jardeheu point, separating the rivulet which passes St. Martin from that which empties itself into Omonville harbour. From the middle of the beach at the head of St. Martin's bay to Jardeheu point, the shore is bordered by rocks which dry ; outside these are others in separate groups, of which the most remarkable are the Martiauroc and the Esquina ; the former is covered only at high springs, the latter is one of the largest rocks in the bay and has two heads very near each other, one rising 30 feet above the highest tides. Several ledges, of which some uncover, extend half a mile north-westward of the Martiauroc and form a sort of causeway terminated by the Parmentiere, a rock with only 3 feet water. Buoy. \u2014 The Parmentiere rock is marked by a black buoy off its western edge. The opening into the bay is about three quarters of a mile wide between the Herbeuses and the Martiauroc, but the only channel by which vessels can enter and get up to the anchorage under the fort, without a pilot, is barely a quarter of a mile wide, and is between the Parmentiere rock black buoy and the red buoy marking the ledges eastward of the Herbeuses rocks. JARDEHEU POINT is a small round hill covered with herbage and separated from the hills inland by a narrow isthmus which covers at high tides ; upon its summit there is a mass of large rocks, and it may be easily recognised when bearing S.E. or N.W. ; it is surrounded by rocks and shoals which extend 6 cables northward. The largest and most remarkable of these rocks, the Coque, bears East 3 cables from the point and is 3 feet above the highest tides. The Hures de la Coque, a rocky ledge, extends N.N.E. 3 cables from the Coque, at which distance the depth is only 5jj fathoms, and it causes violent eddies which small vessels must be careful to avoid. One of the rocks on this ledge, lying N.N.E. \\ E. one cable from the Coque, uncovers 10 feet at the lowest"], [375, "Chap. Vin.] 353 TIDAL STREAMS. tides ; it covers near the time of half flood by the shore, and it may be useful to know that when it covers, the flood or eastern stream is running 2\\ or 3 miles from the shore between Omonville and Cherbourg. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on Jardeheu point. Basse Brefort, on which there are only 2\\ feet water, lies N. by E. \\ E. half a mile from Jardeheu point and the same distance N.W. by N. from the Coque. The marks for this shoal, which is dangerous to coasters, are, the summit of the Esquina rock on with a village half way up the hill westward of Jobourg church tower ; and, the Coque entirely concealing the Foireuse, a large rock lying S.S.E. \u00a3 E. from it. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 The sudden change in the direction of the flood or north-eastern stream after passing cape de la Hague occasions a great eddy north-eastward and eastward of that cape, which extends even beyond Omonville and runs along the coast, following a direction opposed to the stream in the offing for nearly nine hours, that is, from 2\\ hours before, to 65 hours after the time of high water by the shore. This eddy begins to form off the entrance of St. Martin's bay about half an hour after the north-eastern stream has commenced in Alderney Race, and its strength increases with that stream ; but, as it runs to the N.W., and, when near the Becchue rock, comes into almost direct opposition to the stream flowing East and E.S.E. out of the Race, it causes a cross sea which is violent in proportion to the rate of that stream. Towards the time of high water in St. Martin's bay, or a quarter of an hour after high water at Goury and a quarter of an hour before it at Omonville, when the stream is at its greatest strength, this confused sea extends nearly 2\\ miles from the shore, to the line of Jobourg church tower on with the Herbeuses rocks. The violence of the sea decreases as the north-eastern stream slackens, and totally ends about a quarter of an hour before the south-western stream begins in the Race. A similar cross sea takes place round Jardeheu point from the meeting of the eddy, which runs north-westward along the shore at Omonville, with the stream of flood which comes from W.N.W. between the Esquina rock and the Basse Brefort. This confused sea is also violent and extends into the offing as far as the line of Jalletin guard-house on with cape de la Hague lighthouse. It commences at A. 2771. Wt. 17197.

VIII. 354 the same time as that near the Becchue but ends 15 or 20 minutes before high water at Omonville; as soon as it ceases, the counter stream or eddy runs round Jardeheu point and extends without interruption from Omonville to the Houffet rocks. The Foireuse, a rock midway between the Coque rock and Omonville harbour, is close to the outer edge of a rocky flat which runs two cables off the intermediate low shore, and its rounded sum mit is 2 feet above the level of the highest tides. A rocky ledge extends half a mile eastward of the Foireuse, and its eastern extreme, on which there are only 4 fathoms water, rises suddenly from soundings of from 17 to 23 fathoms and lies in the direction of the church tower at Digulleville a quarter of a point open southward of the church tower at Omonville W.S.W. The highest rocks on this ledge uncover 8 feet. OMONVILLE.\u2014 This small harbour lies in a slight indenta tion of the coast one mile south-eastward of Jardeheu point and is well sheltered from N.N.W. round by West to S.E. ; but, with strong winds between North and East it is only completely sheltered whilst the rocky ledge which joins the land on its northern side remains uncovered. At neap tides, the highest rocks of this ledge break the waves, and the swell only enters the harbour ; but, during high springs, when all the rocks are covered, there is much sea in it. The position of the harbour may be easily recognised from a distance by the village of Omonville, situated at the bottom of a valley, the slopes of which are highly cultivated ; by a large fort erected on the eastern point of the indentation ; by an old semaphore called the Vigie, on the top of the hill, at the foot of which stands the fort ; and, by a large mass of rock on the summit of the hill bounding the valley on the North. The harbour is only two cables long East and West, and barely a cable wide in the space where vessels may anchor between the rocks. The depths increase gradually from the beach on its western shore to 7 fathoms at the entrance. In the deepest part of the harbour, the soundings vary from 5 to 7 fathoms over a rocky bottom, in the cavities of which are deposits of stiff yellow mud, where anchors hold firmly ; but, as these deposits are of small extent, it is probable that the anchors take hold in the fissures of the rocks. A Life -Boat is stationed at this port. Directions. \u2014 When standing for Omonville harbour with light winds from S.W. or S.E., or during calms after half flood, some"], [377, "Chap.

Under such circumstances, a vessel should be in a position south-eastward of the entrance, so as to have the eddy, described at page 353, and which runs 2\\ knots at springs, favourable for entering. With all other winds, when they are sufficiently strong to ensure stemming the stream, a vessel may run directly for the entrance, taking care, when rounding the rocky ledge which extends half a mile eastward of the Foireuse rock, to have Digulleville church tower half a point open southward of Omonville church tower. The pilots affirm that it is possible to enter the harbour, whatever may be the state of the sea, if a vessel can carry sufficient sail to ensure good steering. There is no difficulty in leaving except with a strong easterly wind. Tides. \u2014 It is high water in Omonville harbour at full and change, at 7h. 29m. ; springs rise 15\u00a3 feet ; neaps 12i feet. The Coast from Omonville trends S.E. \\ E. easterly 6 miles to Querqueville point. From half a mile south-eastward of Omonville to within three quarters of a mile of Urville church, it is high and precipitous, intersected by deep valleys, and terminates in perpen dicular cliffs of grey rock, with no remarkable object on them except a peak of rock resembling a wall in ruins and named Castel Vendon. Half a mile S.S.E. from Omonville fort, a rocky ledge runs out about a quarter of a mile from the shore, and, with this exception, the coast from Omonville to the eastern end of the cliffs is steep-to at any time of tide, the rocks bordering it not extending more than half a cable from the shore. The Mermistin is a rocky flat lying E.S.E. 2 milesfrom Omonville, and a mile from the cliffs of Castel Vendon ; it is about 3| cables long East and West and 2\\ cables broad, with from 6 to 7 fathoms water, and from 10 to 15 fathoms close round it ; from its eastern end, Urville and Nacqueville church towers are in line bearing S. by E. \u00a3 E. QUERQUEVILLE POINT. \u2014 Three quarters of a mile westward of Urville church, the hills take a south-easterly direction and leave between their last slopes and the shore a low narrow plain which terminates eastward at Querqueville point, distinguished by a heavy fort and a lighthouse. \u00bb The shore along this low part of the coast is bordered by a beach of sand, gravel, and rocks, which uncovers at low water, and, in several places, extends as far out as 3 or 4 cables from the land. Outside the Z 2"], [378, "CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. 356 beach is a rocky bank with irregular depths extending nearly a mile from high water mark. Raz de Bannes, the north-western part of this rocky bank, lies between the bearings N. \\ W. and N.E. from Urville church tower, and many of its rocks uncover ; the highest dries 44, feet, and, N.W. half a mile from it, at the north-western extreme of the bank, is a small shoal patch of only 5 feet water. A beacon turret is erected on the Raz de Bannes N.W. westerly 3\u00a3 miles from the western end of Cherbourg breakwater ; it is 10 feet above high water, springs, is painted red with a white top, and is surmounted by a mast with an iron ball. It is a valuable landmark for vessels approaching Cherbourg from the westward in thick weather. Plateau de Nacqueville, off Nacqueville point, is the north eastern part of the same rocky ledge, and, from its eastern extreme, the western part of the Redoute des Couplets, on the summit of a hill southward of St. Anne's bay, is on with the outer wall of the circular battery of Querqueville fort. Large vessels should avoid crossing the plateau at low water as the tide causes much rippling over it, and there is a small 9-feet patch 3| cables from the shore. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station a short distance westward of Querqueville village and church. A Life-Boat is stationed at Querqueville point. Anchorage. \u2014 A vessel, waiting a favourable time to enter Cherbourg road, may anchor between the Plateau de Nacqueville and Querqueville point in 1\\ fathoms, good holding ground of muddy sand. The best position is, with the lighthouse in Fort Imperial, Pelee island, on with the lighthouse in Fort Central on Cherbourg breakwater S.E. by E. \\ E. easterly ; and, the guard-house at Fort Roule a little southward of the circular battery at Querqueville fort S.S.E. \\ E. Tidal Streams. \u2014 One cable northward of the Mermistin ledge, which is at the eastern limit of the great eddy described at page 353, the eastern flood stream begins 3h. 45m. before high water at Cherbourg and at first sets 'southward at the rate of one knot ; from 2 to 3 hours before high water at Cherbourg, it runs S.E. with a velocity of from 34, to 4 knots when its direction again changes to the south ward. One hour after high water, it runs S.S.W. but its rate does not"], [379, "Chap. Vin.] CHERBOURG. 357 exceed a knot, and, as its strength decreases, it assumes a more westerly direction and finally comes to an end about 2 hours after high water at Cherbourg. The direction of the western or ebb stream varies only from West to N.W. from the time of its commencement until 4^ hours after high water at Cherbourg ; but, as its speed decreases, it turns successively to all the points between N.W. and West, where it ends 3h. 45m. before high water. Its greatest velocity, about 3^ knots, occurs from 4 to 5 hours after high water at Cherbourg. At 3 or 4 miles northward of the Mermistin and of Querqueville point, the flood stream begins 3 hours before, and ends about 3 hours after, high water at Cherbourg. Generally speaking, at that distance from the coast, eastward of the Mermistin, and also in the middle of the English Channel, the changes of the tidal streams take place at the times of half flood and half ebb at Cherbourg ; see Tidal stream table, page 383. CHERBOURG.* \u2014 Cherbourg is a sea-port town, naval station, extensive arsenal, and fortress of the first class. The popu- lation of Cherbourg proper was 37,013 in 1886, and that of its suburbs about 10,000 more. The town stands at the mouth of the river Divette and has a considerable trade ; its principal exports being butter, eggs, vegetables, and other provisions ; the imports, coals, guano and other manures, wood, &c. Coals, usually Welsh, are always available for steamers, a coal hulk containing about 400 tons being moored in the roads, alongside of which steamers lie to coal, the price being about 20 francs per ton, but varying consider- ably ; the stock in hand on shore is usually from 3,000 to 4,000 tons. Vessels in the Commercial port can also coal alongside the quays in about 12 feet water. Supplies of all kinds are plentiful, and ordi- nary repairs to sailing vessels or steamers can be executed, there being a gridiron and slips available, as well as a dry dock in the Commercial port, but for complicated repairs of machinery this port is not recommended. The dry docks and other appliances of the arsenal are, of course, not generally available for mercantile purposes. There is no sailor's home at Cherbourg, but, in cases of sickness or accident, sailors are admitted to the Civil or Marine hospital, on the recommendation of Her Majesty's Consul, with guarantee of expenses. The number of merchant vessels entering the port in 18 St) was 612, and their aggregate tonnage 224,757 tons. * See Admiralty plan of port de Cherbourg.

Steamers run five times weekly to Southampton, once a week to Guernsey, and the transatlantic steamers call, the Royal Mail from the West Indies fortnightly, and the Hamburgh steamers from New York weekly. The Western railroad brings Paris within 9 hours distance, and connects with Le Mans, Granville, St. Malo, Caen, and by branches with Brest, Havre, Saint Lo, &c. The service of the electric telegraph is very complete from all points served by the railway, and the Semaphore service by the coast is very efficient and enables marine messages sanctioned by the authorities to be rapidly conveyed to almost all points of the coast. Rade de Cherbourg is comprised within the space between Querqueville point and Pelee island, which bears from Querqueville point E. by S. \u00a3 S. distant 3\u00a3 miles. The roadstead is sheltered on its northern side by the breakwater, and its southern limits are the shores of St. Anne and Cherbourg bays. The area of the sheltered portion, with 3 fathoms depth and upwards, is about 1,650 acres ; with 4 fathoms and upwards, 1,350 acres ; with 5 fathoms and upwards, 900 acres. The shelter afforded by the breakwater to the roadstead is very remarkable and vessels now ride in safety and remain during the winter where formerly they dared not anchor. The Breakwater is a magnificent structure which rises from a depth of from 6 to 7 fathoms at low water, and shelters the road stead from all northerly winds. It consists of a foundation of rubble stone deposited a pier re perdue up to the level of low water, equinoctial springs ; this is 4,060 yards in length and its base about 100 yards wide, having a long foreshore to seaward and its harbour side standing at an angle of 45\u00b0. Upon this foundation is built a wall of masonry, nearly vertical, 33 feet wide at the base and decreasing to 27 feet at the top, which, with the parapet, rises 23 feet above the level of high water, springs. The breakwater does not extend in a straight line but has two arms of unequal length, each diverging 5\u00b0 towards the harbour, the western arm being about one third longer than the eastern. The work was begun in the year 1784, was several times interrupted, but was brought to a successful close in 1853. The chief engineers employed on it were De Cessart, De Lamblardie, Cachin, Fouques-Duparc, Virla, Bonnin, and Reibell, and they have constructed a work of which France may be justly proud. It is defended by Fort Central placed at the point where the arms diverge, by forts at each end,"], [381, "Chap, viii.] 359 CHERBOURG. named respectively Forts de l'Ouest and de l'Est, and by an inter mediate battery on the western arm.* Buoys. \u2014 A large black buoy marks the western extreme of the foundation of the breakwater, and a red buoy its eastern extreme. Pilots. \u2014 The Cherbourg pilots usually cruise between the western entrance and point Jardeheu in open boats which cannot keep the sea in bad weather ; they have, however, one decked boat fit to cruise in any weather. A Life-Boat is stationed at the western end of the breakwater.

Breakwater, West end. \u2014 A fixed red light, 62 feet high, and visible 8 miles, marks the western head of the breakwater. * The first idea of sheltering Cherbourg bay by an artificial work dates as far back as 1665, but the first real project was in 1775 by M. de la Bretonniere, Capitaine de Vaisseau. In 1781 the proposal of M. de Cessart, engineer, to form a breakwater by sinking frustra of cones filled with stone was adopted, and the first cone was sunk in 1784. After 18 such cones had been sunk this plan was abandoned in 1788, and that of depositing stone a pierre perdue was adopted and followed up with occasional intervals until the breakwater reached above high water, but as in that form it could not withstand the force of the sea, M. Fouques-Duparc proposed, in 1829, a vertical wall of masonry based upon the rubble foundation rising from the level of low water of equinoctial spring tides. Such a wall was begun in 1832 and carried on to completion at the close of 1S53. Since then the forts have been in progress. The whole cost of the breakwater has been 2,671,491?., or at the rate of 220?. a lineal foot, measured from end to end of the foot of the embankment. \u2014 Bo/inin, SurV Aeheeement de la Digue de Cherbourg.

St. Anne's hay is two miles wide from Querqueville point to Fort du Hornet, and its shore, on which are several batteries, is low and almost entirely bordered by rocks which uncover at low water. Of these, the Rochefort, a large rock at the head of the bay is about 2 cables from high-water mark, and a mile south-eastward of Quer queville fort ; its summit rises 2 feet above the level of the highest tides. The water is not deep in this bay, there being as little as 3\u00a3 fathoms in parts half a mile from the shore. Not more than 17 feet will be found at the extreme of a rocky projection extending Z\\ cables eastward from the outer wall of the circular battery on Querqueville point, and only 3 feet at 4r| cables south-eastward from the fort, and nearly 4 cables from the shore. Rocky ground, on which there are only 12 feet water, lies E.N.E. half a mile from the Rochefort rock, with the summit of that rock nearly on with Henneville church tower ; and, N.W. westerly 9 cables from Fort du Hornet. This 12-feet patch is much in the way of large vessels beating in or out of Cherbourg road, and should be avoided, at springs, from one third ebb to two thirds flood, and at all times of tide during neaps. A heavy swell is thrown on the beach of this bay when the wind is strong between N.W. and N.E., and it is then dangerous to anchor in it, the bottom being uneven and rocky. Fort Chavagnae stands on a small rocky patch fronting St. Anne's bay, midway between Querqueville fort and the western end of the breakwater ; the patch is about three quarters of a cable long and from 50 to 60 yards wide. The water is deep on the southern side, but shoal for a cable north-eastward of the fort, and the sea breaks heavily with strong gales between N.W. and N.E. ; and, during a weather tide, the sea is much agitated by it ; it is dangerous to approach in calm weather, as the ebb sets directly on it. Cherbourg bay is bounded on its western side by the Tenarde and other rocks off Fort du Hornet, and on its eastern side by"], [383, "Chap, via.] CHERBOURG. 361 the Flamands rocks and Pelee island. The town of Cherbourg and the port du Commerce occupy the head of the bay, and the establishments of the port Militaire the western side, between the town and Fort du Hornet. The shore is low from the front of the town to the Flamands and is bordered by a sandy strand a quarter of a mile wide at low water, with shallow flats of less than 3 fathoms extending 3 or 4 cables farther out. The low land adjoining the shore of this bay soon rises into high hills, between which are the valleys of Roule and Tourlaville. The entrance to the Roule valley is between two hills of unequal height southward of the floating basin of the port du Commerce ; the eastern hill, Mont Roule, is steep and crowned. by Fort Roule at only three quarters of a mile from the shore, which fort commands all the neighbourhood ; on the top of the western hill is a telegraph. Tourlaville valley is eastward of Roule valley and only separated from it by the range of hills, of which Mont Roule forms the north western extreme. The entrance to this valley is wide but it rapidly narrows farther inland. The T^narde is a rocky ledge with three dangerous heads N.E. 2 cables from Fort du Hornet ; it is one cable long W.N.W. and E.S.E. and half a cable wide ; there are 14 ft. water on the western, 6 ft. on the middle, and 9 ft. on the eastern head.

The small church tower at Querqueville kept exactly between the tall spire of that church and the tower of Nacqueville church leads a quarter of a cable northward of the dangerous parts of the Tenarde.

A strong fort,"], [384, "CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. 362 erected on these rocks is approached from the shore by a causeway and drawbridge. Shoal ground with from 7 to 18 feet water extends 4 cables north-westward from the Fort des Flamands ; and, northward and north-eastward of the rocks, this flat extends still farther from the shore, being separated from the eastern end of the breakwater by only 3 cables. Port d'EchOuage.\u2014 On the eastern side of Fort des Flamands is this small harbour, chiefly used by vessels of not more than 300 tons burthen laden with timber for the use of the dockyard. A canal connects it with the Mare de Tourlaville to the eastward, where building timber is stored, and which is 50 acres in extent. The Port du Commerce or Mercantile harbour consists of an Avant-port or outer tidal harbour with the channel leading to it, and a Bassin-a-Flot or wet dock formed by damming and excavating at the mouth of the little river Divette which waters the Roule valley. The bottom of the entrance channel is a mixture of sand, mud, gravel, and shingle, and dries at low water, equinoctial springs ; the channel is between two stone jetties running parallel with each other and 55 yards apart ; the western jetty being only half the length of the eastern jetty, and both marked by the lights described at page 360. The Avant-port admits vessels of about 15 feet draught, at springs, and 9 or 10 feet at neaps. Just within the inner end of the western pier is a repairing slip, with the custom-house adjoining. At 60 yards southward of this slip, a pier has been constructed pro jecting eastward from the western quay, its object being to protect the Avant-port from the swell which sets in with strong north westerly winds. This outer port is surrounded on three sides by quays built of granite, and, within the short pier just described, is 328 yards long in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, 212 yards wide, and dries at low water. Its eastern side, where the old naval arsenal stood is exclusively appropriated to Government vessels, but the southern and western quays, 590 yards in extent, are for the use of merchant vessels. The bottom is hard, and, except in front of the repairing slip and about half way along the western quay, where the bare rock is exposed, it consists of a mixture of sand, gravel, and a little mud. At the foot of the quays, the bottom is level and dries about 7 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; here vessels would lie in safety but for the swell and surf which, though much diminished, still sets in through the channel when the wind"], [385, "Chap. Vin.] 363 CHERBOURG.\u2014 PORT MILITAIRE. blows strongly between West and North, notwithstanding the short pier before described which was built to remedy this evil. Under any circumstances, therefore, vessels should only wait in the outer harbour until there is sufficient water to enter the wet dock. Warping buoys are placed in the centre of the harbour to assist vessels going into the basin, and the shoalest spot over which they have to pass is about 1\\ feet above the level of the lowest tides. The Bassin-a-Flot is 440 yards long and 137 yards wide, having an area of 12 acres ; it communicates with the outer harbour by gates 42 feet wide, and the water rises above their sill, which is 15 inches above the level of the lowest tides, 19 to 21 feet at extraordinary springs, 17 to 18| feet at ordinary springs, and about 13 feet at neaps. The gates remain open about an hour and a half, but are closed with a falling tide. There are building and repairing slips at the head of the basin, and a dry dock 224 feet 4 inches in length on the blocks by 46 feet wide at the entrance, and with 19 feet 4 inches over the sill at high water, springs. Works are now (1888) in progress for deepening the Bassin-a-Flot, the outer harbour, and the entrance channel ; it is hoped that an average increase of depth of from 4 to 6 feet will eventually be gained, but the date of completion of the works is uncertain. As vessels are not permitted to enter without pilots, and as a pilot can always board a vessel in the small roadstead, it is unnecessary to give directions for entering the channel leading to the port du Commerce. The Port Militaire or Dockyard is north-westward of the town of Cherbourg, and occupies a space of about 220 acres of the level ground at the foot of the Equeurdreville and Couplets hills. It is especially appropriated for vessels of war, and is planned as a first class naval dockyard ; it is surrounded by fortifications, Fort du Hornet being its principal defence towards the sea. The Port, properly so called, consists of three extensive basins. The outer tidal basin or Avant-port, of 16 acres, communicates with the roadstead by a short channel opening eastward, in which the least depth is 15 feet ; and, with the Bassin-a-Flot, the northern or Charles X. basin of 15 acres, by gates 59 feet wide, having their sill 134; feet below the level of the lowest tides. Both these basins have been formed in the solid rock to a depth of about 32 feet below the same level. An inner basin named the Bassin Napoleon III., of 20 acres in extent, was opened in August 1858. It has seven first-class building"], [386, "364 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. slips, and one dry dock on its western side, four dry docks on the northern, and two double dry docks on the southern side. There are also four building slips on the southern side of the Avant-port, making eleven in all, and seven docks. The two longest docks are 490 feet in length over all with 80 feet width of entrance ; the shortest dock is 246 feet in length by 60 feet width of entrance, and all the docks have a uniform depth over the sill at low water, springs, of 27 feet. The quays and docks are faced with fine granite from Dielette, Flamanville, and Chausey. On the northern side, sur rounding the docks, are the steam factory and workshops for repairing vessels. Time Signal. \u2014 The time signal is made from the look-out of Fort l'Onglet, Quay Napoleon, at an elevation of 35 feet above the sea. It is made by a metal disc about three feet in diameter ; the disc is placed in a vertical position five minutes before the signal is made, and is dropped to a horizontal position at the instant, by electricity, from the Naval Observatory. The time signal is made at 10 hours A.M. Paris mean time, equivalent to 21h. 50m. 39s. Greenwich mean time ; and repeated at lOh. 2m. Paris mean time, equivalent to 21h. 52m. 39s. Greenwich mean time. When not in use, the disc is inclined at an angle of 45\u00b0. A r ILE PELEE is what remains of the long point which formerly extended nearly 14; miles northward from the coast, but was separated from it by the action of the sea, leaving a shallow channel between it and the mainland nearly half a mile wide. This island is a flat of bare rock, nearly covered at high water ; but, at low water, springs, it is about three quarters of a mile long from North to South by half a mile wide, and is in the form of a horseshoe concave towards the East ; its highest point is a heap of stones awash at high water, equinoctial springs. Fort Imperial stands on the western point of the island, and defends the eastern entrance to Cherbourg road. The south-western bastion of the fort has on it a flagstaff, and the fixed ivhite light already described is exhibited from the north-eastern bastion ; both bastions are sufficiently high to be seen at the distance of 10 or 12 miles from seaward. The north-western and north eastern extremes of the island are marked respectively by the Tromet and Happetout beacon towers, and, its south-eastern extreme, by the Pont de l'lle beacon.

VIII.] CHERBOURG.\u2014 ILE PELEE FLAT. 365 DANGERS on ILE PELEE FLAT.\u2014 The principal dangers which do not uncover upon the rocky flat forming the base of Pelee island are, the Basse du Chenal, the Basse de Happetout, the North western point of the flat, and the Truite rock. Basse du Chenal is a rocky ledge about a cable in diameter, of which several parts are nearly awash at low water. It is at the western entrance of the narrow channel which separates Pelee island from the main, one third of a mile from the shore, and its western edge S. \\ W. 64; cables from the lighthouse on Fort Imperial. The spire of Querqueville church, seen between the small tower of that church and an isolated house on the high ground southward of the village of Nacqueville, points to the centre of the ledge. The channel between Pelee island and the main is very shallow, many spots being nearly awash at low water, springs. Basse de HappetOUt, a small isolated rocky patch with only 13 feet water, is at the north-eastern extreme of the dangers of Pelee island. It lies E. \\ N. northerly nearly one mile from Fort Imperial lighthouse, with the high battery of Fort du Hornet just open north ward of the lower battery of Fort Imperial ; and, the small houses adjoining the eastern part of the barrack at the Becquet de Denneville on with the houses of a farm on the height above the limestone quarries called the Becquet cliffs. A little westward of the Happetout is another patch with 3 fathoms water. The rocky flat of Pelee island extends 2 cables in a northerly direction from the northern side of the island, and as the sea is always disturbed upon it, and the soundings vary from 9 to 23 feet, it is prudent for vessels to avoid approaching its northern edge. The spire of Querqueville church well open northward of Fort Central leads clear of it. The North-west Point of the Flat has 4 fathoms on it at low water, but less than half a cable within or eastward of it, are some rocky heads with from 14 to 11 feet. The flood stream sets strongly towards this point, which becomes very dangerous when with westerly winds the stream is at its greatest strength. Buoy. \u2014 The north-western point of this flat is marked by a black buoy, lying N. by W. \u00a3 W. 44 cables from Fort Imperial lighthouse. The Truite rock, at the western point of the flat on the eastern side of the Passe de l'Est or eastern channel into Cherbourg road, is about half a cable long from East to West and 60 yards wide. The"], [388, "366 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. shoalest spot on the eastern end of the rock, where there are only 3| feet water, bears N. W. 520 yards from Fort Imperial lighthouse ; and, E. \u00a3 S. southerly 3f cables from the lighthouse at the eastern end of the breakwater. The marks for the western outer end of the rock, in 10 feet, are, the end of the eastern jetty of the port du Commerce seen a little within the eastern side of the square tower of Cherbourg church ; and, the barracks at Becquet open half their length southward of the outer wall of the low battery and south western bastion of Fort Imperial. Buoy. \u2014 This rock is marked off its north-western edge by a black buoy, similar to that on the north-western point of the flat ; and, although there is much less sea in the vicinity of the Truite than at the north-western point of the flat, both buoys are liable to drift from their exposed positions, and more dependence should be placed on the landmarks given than on the buoys being in their places. The Pelee bank is the sand-bank extending westward from Pelee island into the most sheltered part of the Grande Rade. There are from 20 to 25 feet on its western extreme S. by W. a quarter of a mile from Fort Central. It limits the roadstead for deep ships on its northern and north-eastern sides, but there is excellent shelter for vessels of moderate draught between it and the eastern arm of the breakwater. ANCHORAGES in RADE de CHERBOURG.\u2014 The prin- cipal anchorages for ships of war and large vessels are, the Grande Rade and the Western anchorage ; and, for smaller vessels, the Petite Rade and the Eastern anchorage between Pelee bank and the eastern arm of the breakwater. St. Anne's bay does not afford good anchorage, as the soundings are irregular, the holding ground bad, and vessels are exposed to great danger if caught there - by northerly winds which throw in a heavy sea. The Grande Rade is bounded on its northern and north eastern sides by the Pelee bank, on its eastern and southern sides by the sandy bottom adjoining the shore, and its western limit is the meridian of Cherbourg church. The bottom in the northern part of the road is for the most part composed of schistose rock in a state of decomposition, and the holding ground is good ; immediately southward of this rock the bottom is of fine muddy sand which is not sufficiently stiff to hold well, but it improves on nearing the"], [389, "Chap. Vin.] 367 RADE DE CHERBOURG. shore and the holding ground is good in the southern part of the road, especially southward of the line of Nacqueville church tower on with the spire of Querqueville church. A short distance south ward of this line, however, there is not sufficient depth at low water for large vessels to anchor. The pilots moor vessels S.E. and N.W. and veer cable to meet the alternate streams of flood and ebb, which, however, are generally weak ; it is advisable always to keep a clear hawse and to be pre pared to withstand winds from the north-westward, which are frequent. Fresh winds from N.W. to North throw a heavy sea into some parts of the roadstead, but it is well sheltered from strong N.N.E. winds ; those from E.N.E. to E.S.E. raise a heavy swell from the time of half flood to half ebb by the shore. A great part of the Grande Rade is occupied by government moorings and buoys. The \"Western anchorage is about 2 cables southward of the western arm of the breakwater and parallel with it for an extent of 8 cables ; the bottom is of fine sand and broken shells, with depths of from 7 to 8 fathoms. Vessels of all sizes may ride here in safety. The Petite Rade has good holding ground and is southward of the Grande Rade, in the space which is sheltered by Fort du Hornet from westerly winds and the sea occasioned by them. Its northern limit is defined by the outer wall of the round battery on Querqueville point on with Fort du Hornet ; southward of this line, the soundings decrease rather rapidly from 26 to 16 feet. About 2 cables north westward of the best anchorage in this road, are two small isolated rocky banks occupying together a space of about a cable from S.W. to N.E. ; there are 26 feet on the shoalest part of the northern bank, and 28 feet on the southern bank which is the smaller of the two and is on the line which marks the northern limit of the road ; this part is occupied by four large mooring buoys used by ships swinging to adjust their compasses. Other mooring buoys lie in the southern and eastern parts of the Petite Rade, but there is a consider able space clear for vessels to lie at their own anchors. Vessels use the Petite Rade when awaiting sufficient water to enter the port du Commerce ; those of deep draught arriving during neaps and obliged to wait for higher tides to enter the port du Commerce, should moor with open hawse to the S.W. and with the longest scope of cable on the north-western anchor ; if a gale from the northward appears probable, they should lay out a third anchor with"], [390, "368 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. a good scope of cable to the N.E. Strong gales from S.W. to S.E. are very much felt at this anchorage and vessels are liable to be driven out close to the breakwater, where, Avith such winds, the sea is greatly disturbed. The Eastern Anchorage is that between the Pelee bank, described at page 366, and the eastern arm of the breakwater ; it is used chiefly by merchant vessels seeking shelter during gales from N.N.W. round by North to E.N.E. Its limits are from the meridian of Fort Central, where it is 24; cables wide, to about 1^ cables westward of the eastern end of the breakwater where it is only 1^ cables wide. The bottom at this anchorage is sand, mixed with a little mud in some places, and the depth which decreases towards the bank, varies from 26 to 32 feet ; vessels should not anchor here with strong winds from W.N.W. round by South to S.S.E. as the holding ground is not good with those winds. CHANNELS into the RADE de CHERBOURG\u2014 Ships of war and vessels of deep draught enter Cherbourg road by the channels round both ends of the breakwater. The Passe de l'Ouest, between the western end of the breakwater and Fort Chavagnae, is the best and is about half a mile wide. Passe de l'Ouest. \u2014 There is no difficulty in entering this channel with a leading wind, vessels having only to approach the western end of the breakwater on about a S.S.E. bearing, and, on nearing it, to pass midway between it and Fort Chavagnae ; but those of deep draught turning in with the flood stream must be careful to avoid the rocky patch on which Fort Chavagnae stands, also the rocky ground with 12 feet water E.N.E. half a mile from the Rochefort rock, and the Tenarde shoal ; it would be imprudent to turn through at night except the weather be clear and moonlight. The Channel between Forts de Querqueville and Chavagnae is not so wide as the Western channel and should only be used by large ships in cases of necessity, and then only between half flood and half ebb. No sailing vessel should attempt it during calm weather, as there would be great risk of being drifted on the rocks at the head of St. Anne's bay by the eddy on the flood caused by Querqueville point ; neither would there be any advantage in hugging the shore of this bay with land winds, as they frequently come in gusts from the openings of the valleys, especially when it blows hard from the South-west."], [391, "Chap. VIII.] CHERBOURG.\u2014 CHANNELS.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. 369 Passe de l'Est is between the eastern end of the breakwater and the two black buoys, before described, marking the most dangerous spots on the western edge of Pelee island flat, viz., the North-west point of the flat and the Truite rock. The narrowest part of the channel is 24 cables wide between the breakwater and Truite buoys, and has in it from 28 to 32 feet, but, besides being narrow, this channel has the disadvantage of being crossed obliquely by the tidal streams, rendering it dangerous for sailing vessels with light winds and impracticable during calms ; there is, however, no difficulty or danger in a steamer or with a commanding breeze. Vessels from the eastward intending to run through this channel on the flood, should be careful to give a good berth to the North west point of Pelee island flat, keeping rather westward of the exact line of the channel until that point is passed, as the flood stream sets strongly towards it. Octeville church just open eastward of the fort on the eastern end of the breakwater S.W. 4 W. leads in clear of the North-west flat of lie Pelee, should the buoy be gone ; and, on closing the fort, alter course so as to pass between the Truite black buoy and the red buoy off the eastern end of the breakwater. This channel is available for ships of the deepest draught between half flood and half ebb. The shallow channel southward of Pelee island trends in a W. by N. and E. by S. direction, is 54; cables long and a cable wide, and carries a depth of about 6 feat in its western part and from 2 to 6 feet in its eastern part, except on its southern side where are two rocks with less than one foot water bearing respectively from the Greves beacon N.N.E. If cables and N. by W. \u00a3 W. 1^ cables. This channel is bounded on the northern side by the Basse du Chenal and the rocks southward and south-eastward of Pelee island ; and, on its southern side, by the low-water rocks along the shore and by the two rocks just described which are more than a cable outside the rocks which dry ; the highest of these latter is the Vieille which dries 10 feet above the level of the lowest tides and covers at one third flood, but is also marked by a beacon which bears W. by N. 4 N. 2| cables from the Greves rock beacon. From the Vieille, Nacqueville church tower is on with the small spire of Querqueville church, and, as long as it is covered, a vessel in charge of a pilot and drawing less than 12 feet water may enter this channel. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Approaching Cherbourg from the Westward. \u2014 The western end of Cherbourg breakwater bears S.E. 4 E. easterly 85 miles from Start point ; S. by E. easterly A. 2771. Wt. 17197. 2 A"], [392, "370 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. 59 miles from the Bill of Portland ; and, S. by W. \u00a3 W. 59 miles from the entrance to the Needles. When bound to any French port east ward of cape de la Hague from the westward, the best landfall to make is the coast of England, proceeding exactly as if bound for an eastern English port, as directed in Channel Pilot, part I., until arrived at a proper position to haul over towards the French coast- Thus, when bound for Cherbourg, proceed by the English shore until abreast of the Start, when having ascertained the vessel's position and the weather being clear, a course may be shaped to make the Casquets ; or, bearing in mind the great strength and variety of tide in the neighbourhood of the Casquets and to avoid all danger of being carried through the Ortac, Swinge, or Race channels, especially should the weather be at all doubtful, it may be better to make Portland and then stand across for the French coast, shaping a course about half a point westward of cape Barfleur. The ship's position may then be accurately fixed by cross bearings of capes de la Hague and Barfleur by day or of their lights by night ; the white side of Mont Roule is also a conspicuous object by day, being visible at a distance of 20 miles in clear weather. Should it be determined to make the Casquets, consider carefully the direction of the wind and tidal streams as well as the state of the weather, which, unless clear, may render the approach to these islets not only difficult but dangerous. On nearing them, great care must be taken to avoid being set southward of them, especially whilst the tide is flowing on their shores, when there would be great risk of being drawn into the Swinge channel and being obliged to cross Alderney Race at the time the sea is most agitated. From a position about 9 miles N.W. of the Casquets, the course to be steered must depend greatly upon wind and tide. With the wind anywhere from W.S.W. round by North to N.N.E., and making due allowance for tide, a course of about E. \\ S. for 14 miles leads 5 miles northward of all danger up to the meridian of the western point of Alderney, when cape de la Hague lighthouse should bear about S.E. \u00a3 S. 13 miles ; then an E.S.E. course for 11 miles leads to a position from which the lighthouse, well open of the land, bears S.S.W. 6^ miles ; and, from thence, a course steered S.S.E. \u00a3 E. easterly for 14^ miles leads to the western entrance into Cherbourg road. These courses keep a vessel a safe distance outside the dangers, and also outside the strong streams of tide running through the Ortac and Swinge channels and Alderney Race ; but, with the wind between W.S.W. and S.S.W., and the north-eastern stream running through these channels, to prevent being drifted too far northward,"], [393, "Chap. Vin.] 371 CHERBOURG. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. an E. by S. \u00a3 S. course may be shaped from the first position given (N.W. 9 miles from the Casquets) which leads about 2\\ or 3 miles from the shore on the meridian of cape de la Hague, and Cherbourg road can then be gained without difficulty ; whereas, with south-westerly winds, if during the flood the meridian of cape de la Hague should be crossed at 6 or 7 miles from the shore, a sailing vessel runs great risk of missing the entrance to Cherbourg road. During the ebb stream, with a fresh breeze, a heavy sea will be found off the entrances of all these channels. At Night. \u2014 Approaching the western channel into Cherbourg road, when eastward of cape de la Hague, keep its light in sight over the land until Querqueville fixed white light bears S.S.W., then stand to the southward until the fixed ivhite light in Fort Imperial, lie Pelee, opens southward of Fort Central fixed and flashing light, after which the seaman must be guided by the red light on the western end of the breakwater. The most unfavourable winds for a sailing vessel to approach Cherbourg from the direction of the Casquets, are those from the eastward, and especially a south-easterly wind. With a moderate breeze, however, from these quarters, the sea is generally smooth, and, during the flood, the passage is not difficult ; but, on the ebb, it is absolutely impossible, and she should then make a long board to the northward and endeavour to hold her own until the stream slacks : then, the shore should be again approached to take advantage of the first of the flood, and long boards made in order to reach the road stead or a position eastward of its meridian, so as to enter with the latter part of the flood or the beginning of the ebb. On account of the great strength of the tidal streams, calm and fog are chiefly to be feared when making this passage, and, if threatened by either, every effort should be made to get into the middle of the Channel where the streams are much weaker than near the French coast. From the Eastward. \u2014 The course and distance from 2 miles southward of the Royal Sovereign light-vessel to cape Barfleur is W.S.W. southerly 89 miles. Vessels coming from the North Sea or from the northern part of the English channel and bound for Cherbourg with the wind between North and East, after clearing Dover strait, generally steer direct for cape Barfleur, but with other winds they should endeavour to confirm their reckoning by the bearings of some headland on the English or French coasts ; thus, with northerly 2 A 2"], [394, "CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. 372 winds Beachy head should be made, and, with southerly winds, cape d'Antifer, or the lighthouse at Fecamp, which latter may be seen at the distance of 18 miles.* The most unfavourable winds for making this passage are those between N.W. and W.S.W. ; but, as the change of stream in mid Channel does not take place until 2 or 3 hours after it does so near the shore, it is often possible to keep in a favourable stream 8 or 9 hours out of the 12. Approaching cape Barfleur during the flood, in order to avoid being drawn into the bay of the Seine or into Barfleur race, where the tide runs with great violence, do not stand into less than 22 fathoms water, which depth may be found about 2 miles from the cape ; the same distance and depth should also be preserved on the ebb, to keep outside the race and the short chopping sea off that cape on a weather tide. Between cape Barfleur and cape Levi, do not stand into less than 26 fathoms as the dangers between these capes extend 24 miles from the coast ; and, a berth of at least two miles should be given to cape Levi to clear the foul ground off it. To avoid being embayed between cape Levi and Pelee island, where a sudden shift of wind might place her in difficulty, and also to avoid the dangers on Pelee island flat, a large vessel turning to windward between the cape and island should not stand farther southward than to have Querqueville spire on with the northern end of Fort Central ; at night, she should tack when Fort Central light bears West. Leaving Cherbourg. \u2014 Sailing vessels bound westward from Cherbourg do well not to leave the road until the wind is sufficiently settled to carry them clear of the English Channel. They generally stand out through the western channel at the commencement of the ebb, and, if the wind is light, after rounding Fort du Hornet, borrow towards the breakwater to avoid drifting on the Chavagnae rock, the ebb making directly towards it. When on the meridian of cape de la Hague, and 6 or 7 miles from it, they steer about W.N.W. until the Casquets bear S.S.E. when a W. by S. course takes them out of the channel. These courses lead out of the influence of the streams running through the Casquet and Swinge channels and Alderney Race, and in the direction of the offing streams, and also sufficiently near the island of Ushant to admit of taking a departure from it if the weather is clear ; if the weather is not favourable, the chief object is to make \u2022 * Se.\" Admiralty chart, North coast of France.

If bound into the Gulf of St. Malo and intending to pass through the Race, vessels should endeavour so to time their leaving Cherbourg as to be at the entrance of the Race towards half ebb by the shore ; that is, at the end of the north-eastern stream in that channel, and they should then steer so as to pass through the centre of it ; see page 347. Bound eastward from the Rade de Cherbourg with a westerly wind, weigh towards half flood ; or, if in the Bassin-a-flot of the port du Commerce, quit it as soon as the gates are open and run out by the eastern channel, see page 369. When well clear of this channel, a vessel leaving the road at half flood by the shore will have the beginning of the Channel flood stream, and if favoured with a fresh breeze, she will carry that stream for 8 or 9 hours to the eastward. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in the port du Commerce, at 7h. 49m., and, as before stated, the water rises above the sill of the Bassin-a-flot (which is itself 15 inches above the level of the lowest tides) at extraordinary springs from 19 to 21 feet ; at ordinary springs 17 to 184; feet ; and, at neaps, 13 feet. Strong westerly winds in the entrance of the English channel cause the tides in the Avant-port to rise one or two feet higher, even during calm weather in the vicinity of the port, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. With violent westerly winds, at springs, the sea frequently flows over the quays of the outer harbour. The mean duration of the flood is 5h. 45m. ; and, of the ebb, 6h. 35m. Tidal Streams.* \u2014 The flood stream begins to be felt in the Grande Rade half an hour after low water by the shore and ceases three quarters of an hour after high water ; its direction is south easterly and its rate about 2 knots. The greatest speed of the north-western or ebb stream hardly ever exceeds H knots unless the the wind is strong from N.E. or East. In the Western anchorage, the flood stream commences about an hour after low water on the shore and ends an hour after high water. The streams are feeble throughout the whole extent of both this and the Eastern anchorage. The Petite Rade is in the eddy of the flood stream occasioned by the projection of Hornet point. This eddy extends as far as the northern limit of the road and forms a counter stream which sweeps * See also Table of Tidal Streams, page 3\u00ab3."], [396, "374 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. along the shore in a W.N.W. direction from about 3 or 4 cables eastward of the entrance to the port du Commerce to the head of the bay, and then northward along the boundary wall of the dockyard. It begins about half flood by the shore and continues until high water ; its greatest rate is about 14; knots, at springs, and its rate decreases towards high water. The ebb stream follows the same direction and at half ebb, when it is at its greatest strength, its rate is about 2 knots. About half a mile northward of the western channel into Cherbourg, the flood stream, which runs S.S.E. and S.E., commences about 14 hours after low water by the shore, and ceases lh. 20m. after high water, its greatest speed being 3 knots. The ebb runs N.W. by N. at nearly the same rate. In the entrance channel, the flood stream first takes a S.S.W. direction, but, as it gains its greatest strength, which is about 2 knots at springs, it inclines towards S.S.E. The direction of the ebb varies from N.N.W. to N.W., its rate being nearly the same as that of the flood. The flood stream ceases at the western end of the breakwater about an hour after high water in the port Militaire. The flood stream begins to be felt in the eastern channel into Cherbourg one hour after low water by the shore, and ceases one hour after high water. Its direction is E. by S. between the breakwater and Truite buoys, and its greatest speed at from 4 to 5 hours flood by the shore, is 2^ knots ; but, a little northward of this position, the stream runs East 34 knots. At the North-west point of Pelee island flat, as well as on its northern edge, its direction is E.N.E., and its greatest velocity 4 knots. The eddies formed by the uneven rocks on the flat produce a violent and dangerous race. The ebb experiences fewer variations and its rate is rather less than the flood. It runs along the northern edge of Pelee island, and, from thence, West, until the rocks are uncovered ; but, outside the flat and breakwater, its direction is W.N.W. The streams between Pelee island and the land run E.S.E. and W.N.W. and their greatest strength is from 24 to 3 knots. The Coast between Pelee island and cape Levi, which bears from it E. \u00a3 S. 4 miles, forms a bight where sailing vessels should avoid getting embayed. From the Flamands rocks to the middle of this bight, the shore is low and broken into small projections, of which the most remarkable is Heu point in front of Bretteville village. A short distance inland are the calcareous cliffs known as Becquet"], [397, "Chap. VITI.] TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 PORT DU BECQUET. 375 quarries, one of the most remarkable objects in the neighbourhood of Cherbourg. Brique point, with its steep sides covered with verdure, is also conspicuous ; it bears E. \u00a3 N. 1\u00a3 miles from Heu point and on it is a mound. One cable W.S.W. of this is Le Castel, another mound of similar form ; on its summit stands a guard-house. The tower of Maupertuis church, about 2 miles eastward of Bretteville church, is a useful landmark for this part of the coast. PORT du BECQUET, 14, miles south-eastward of Pelee island and three quarters of a mile westward of Heu point, is in front of a group of houses close to the shore. It is formed by a pier running parallel with the shore and closed at the western end, the entrance being at the eastern end ; it is a grounding place about a cable long and less than half a cable wide, surrounded by quays of dry stone work ; in it there are only from 12 to 15 feet at high water, springs, and it is specially intended for boats loading with stone from the Becquet quarries. A Life-Boat is stationed here. LIGHTS. \u2014 There are two leading lights at Port du Becquet shown from iron standards bearing from each other N.E. 4_ N. and S.W. 4_ S. and 76 yards apart ; the inner light is red, 29 feet above high water, and visible through an arc of 16\u00b0 on either side of the centre of the channel, its intensity diminishing towards the extremes. The outer light is white, and 26 feet above high water. They should be seen in clear weather respectively 9 and 7 miles, and, when in line, they lead up to the entrance of the port mid-way between the pier-end and a beacon tower marking a mass of rock 1\u00a3 cables eastward of the pier. The Grunes de Bretteville is the rocky ground three quarters of a mile wide extending perpendicularly from the shore between Heu and Brique points ; at the outer edge, Nacqueville church tower is on with the Happetout rock, the north-eastern point of Pelee island. The depths are tolerably regular, from 13 feet near the shore to 9 or 10 fathoms about a mile off. The only dangerous spot is a head of rock with only 12 feet water, 54 cables from the shore, with Le Castel bearing S.E. by E. 4. E. ; and, Bretteville church tower S.W.

To improve the approach to this little harbour at night, it is proposed shortly to erect a lighthouse on the jetty. A black beacon turret stands on a rock off the entrance ; it should be left on the port hand in entering. Anchorage. \u2014 At 3 or 4 cables West and W.N.W. from the jetty, there is good holding ground in 9 fathoms, muddy bottom, where vessels bound eastward against a fonl wind may wait in safety during the ebb tide. This anchorage is protected by Fort Levi, which stands on the northern point of the bay, and a good berth is, with the semaphore seen midway between the fort and cape Levi lighthouse. CAPE LEVI is low, being the northern termination of some low hills detached from the high lands of the interior. On the highest parts of these hills stand two houses, very close to each other, which may be seen from a considerable distance ; the northern house is an old semaphore station and the other a guard-house. Several rocky patches which uncover extend as far as 4 cables north-eastward from the cape. The outer patch is terminated by the Bieroc, a remarkable rock with a rounded head 5 or 6 feet above the level of high water. LIGHT. \u2014 On the extreme of Cape Levi stands a square light house, from which at 115 feet above high water, is exhibited a. fixed white light, varied by a red flash every three minutes, visible in clear weather from a distance of 13 miles. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on a mound about 13 feet high, 383 yards south-eastward of the lighthouse. CAPE LEVI RACE is occasioned by the strong tides and uneven rocky ground which extends N. by E. E. 2 miles from the cape. This rocky ground is in some places half a mile wide, is elevated considerably above the general level of the bottom, and, as it lies across the direction of the tidal streams, it causes a heavy sea, especially on a weather tide. It is stated by local pilots that with strung easterly winds on the flood, at springs, this Race is as dangerous and the sea as bad as in Alderney Race."], [399, "Chap. VIII.] CAPE LEVI. \u2014 ANSE DE LA MONDREE. 377 Some patches rising from the rocky bottom in this Race are dangerous even for small vessels at all times of tide ; they are the Bieroc patch, Basse du cap Levi, Pierre Noire, and Tete Septentrionale or northern head of the race. The Bieroc Patch is small and rocky, with only 3 feet water H cables northward of the Bieroc, from which it derives its name. Basse du Cap Levi is a rocky ledge about 2 cables long N.N.W. and S.S.E. and 14^ cables wide ; at its south-eastern point is a dangerous 13-feet patch N.N.W. \u00a3 W. half a mile from the Bieroc. The Pierre Noire or Black rock bears N. 4 E. one mile from the summit of the Bieroc ; it is one of the most dangerous rocks in the race, having only 7 feet over it at the lowest tides. Buoy. \u2014 A black bell buoy is moored outside the north-eastern extreme of this danger ; it, however, occasionally breaks adrift. The Tete Septentrionale is at the north-western extreme of the rocky bottom, N. 4/ W. 14 miles from the Bieroc ; E. by N. rather more than 6 miles from Fort Central on Cherbourg breakwater : and, N.W. by W. 4 W. 84 miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse. There are 33 feet on this rocky head at low water, but as it rises precipitously from soundings of from 19 to 25 fathoms, it causes great eddies, and the sea breaks on it in bad weather. Vessels of moderate draught in charge of pilots, may, if the weather permits, pass through the race between the Basse du cap Levi and the Pierre Noire, at low water ; but, large vessels should always pass northward of the race. The Coast between cape Levi and cape Barfleur, which are distant 8 miles from each other and on the same parallel of latitude, is generally low and sandy, but the adjacent lands rise at a short distance from the shore and are joined to the hills in the interior by slight undulations of which the highest are, Carneville heath, the woody mound at St. Pierre, the hills bounding Saire valley, and Pernelle hill. ANSE de la MONDREE, immediately eastward of cape Levi, between the Bieroc and Blanche rocks, is about 14 miles wide and recedes three quarters of a mile ; there is good anchorage on its"], [400, "CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR.

The best anchorage is with the Bieroc bearing N.W. by N. ?>\\ cables ; and, the Semaphore on cape Levi about W.S.W. With strong northerly winds, no landing can be effected in this bay, nor upon any part of the coast between Capes Levi and Barfleur, except in Roubaril cove near the latter cape. Roubaril cove. \u2014 This small cove is half a mile westward of cape Barfleur and, in it, coasters, under the care of good pilots, may take refuge in time of need. The local fishermen state that, in case of necessity, a vessel under 12 feet draught could be saved by running into it at high water. The cove is about half a cable wide and a cable deep, and the rocks bordering its sides are always un covered. The water flows into it at about half flood. DANGERS Off the COAST.\u2014 The coast between capes Levi and Barfleur is studded with dangers, of which some extend 24 miles into the offing ; between them and the shore are some winding channels, through which coasting vessels with good pilots may pass even at low water. The Sen is a small isolated rock, just awash at the lowest tides, 8 cables from the shore in a N.E. by N. direction from Coqueville church. Basses du Sen. \u2014 These shoals are numerous separate patches, extending westward, northward, and eastward of the Sen rock. The shoal northward of the rock is 8 cables long and 34; cables wide ; it has two dangerous rocky heads, of which one has only 44 feet water ; on the other, which from its position is called the Tete du Milieu, or Middle head, there are 54 feet. North-westward of this shoal are four isolated rocky heads, with from 21 to 31 feet water ; from the Tete du Nord-Ouest, the outer of these heads, Gatteville church tower on with a rock at Neville point which is awash at the highest neaps, bears S.E. 4. S. southerly ; and, St. Pierre church tower on with a house at Coqueville, which on that bearing appears to stand a little westward of the church tower of that village, S. by W. westerly."], [401, "Chap. VIII.] DANGERS OFF THE COAST. 379 A fifth rocky head with 9 fathoms water lies N. by E. three quarters of a mile from the Middle head, with Fort Central light house on Cherbourg breakwater bearing W. f S. 9\u00a3 miles ; and, cape Barfleur lighthouse S.E. easterly 6 miles ; it is dangerous only on account of the heavy sea occasioned by the eddies. There are no dangers between the Sen shoals and cape Levi race, and 6 or 7 fathoms water will be found at the outer edges of the rocks and banks which extend as far as 6 cables from the coast. The Renier, a small rock uncovering 4 feet, is a mile from the shore at the northern angle of a triangular rocky flat, of which the base is towards the shore. This flat has a number of rocky heads which uncover at low water. Basses du Renier. \u2014 These shoals are from one to 1J miles north-eastward and northward of the Renier rock ; they form three distinct patches, the Basse du Sud-Est, Basse du Centre, and Basse du Nord-Ouest ; the Basse du Sud-Est has 21 feet water, the Basse du Centre, 15 feet, and the Basse du Nord-Ouest, 26 feet. Buoy. \u2014 A black bell buoy is moored just outside the 15-feet spot on the Basse du Centre. The Basse du Nord-Ouest is the outermost danger between cape Levi and cape Barfleur ; it is about 2^ miles from the shore and less than a quarter of a mile within the 21-fathoms line of soundings bordering the coast. From its shoalest spot of 26 feet, cape Barfleur lighthouse bears S.E. 4 S. southerly rather more than 5 miles ; and, Fort Central lighthouse on Cherbourg breakwater W. \\ S 104^ miles. One mile E.S.E. from the shoalest part of the Basse du Nord-Ouest is a small patch with 8 fathoms water ; and, as it rises precipitously from soundings of from 14 to 19 fathoms, it occasions eddies and over falls which are dangerous to cross during strong winds. The eddies caused by both the Renier and Sen shoals raise a heavy sea during a weather tide. The Roquette, a small isolated rocky patch of only 4 feet water, lies N.N.E. about 1\\ miles from Neville point ; and, N.W. \\ N. 3 miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse. There is another patch with 5 fathoms S.S.E. 2 cables from the Roquette, and many others lie between the Roquette and the Renier."], [402, "380 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. Plateau des EquetS is a rocky ridge S.E. \\ S. about one mile from the Roquette and N.W. by N. nearly 2 miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse ; it is of a circular form, about 3 cables in diameter, and has four dangerous heads, of which the highest rises from its southern part and uncovers nearly 2 feet ; there are from 2 to 5 feet on the other heads. Haut-Fond des Equets, a rocky patch of 28 feet water, with from 10 to 12 fathoms round it, lies 1\u00a3 miles from the coast, 54^ cables northward of the Plateau des Equets, and about N.N.W. \\ W. 2\\ miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse. The marks for it are : \u2014 the tower of St. Pierre church seen between the church tower and redoubt at Retoville ; and, the small tower of Gatteville church on with a powder magazine on the shore near the guard-house at Gatteville. Bane de Saint Pierre is a collection of sand and broken shells, extending in a south-easterly direction 1\u00a3 miles from the plateau des Equets, and terminating at the depth of 25 feet N.N.E. \\ E. 54 cables from cape Barfleur lighthouse. The shoalest part of the bank, which is about half a mile wide, has three patches of from 4 to 6 feet water, and the sea breaks with great violence on them during a weather tide ; this must cause these depths frequently to vary, but the body of the bank remains stationary. Directions. \u2014 Vessels of deep draught, and even small craft without pilots, should keep outside the dangers just described, which extend as far as 24 miles from the coast between cape Levi and cape Barfleur ; and, the directions given for approaching Cherbourg from the eastward, at page 371, should be attended to. At night, in clear weather, bearings of Fort Central light on Cherbourg breakwater and of cape Barfleur light, as well as that on Cape Levi, greatly assist the mariner in avoiding these dangers, which should not be approached within a depth of 26 fathoms ; but, in thick weather, vessels should keep well off the coast, as the lead does not give sufficient warning of their proximity. Tidal Streams. \u2014 At 24 miles from the coast between cape Levi and cape Barfleur, the flood stream commences about the time of half flood by the shore, and ends at half ebb. It attains its greatest speed at the time of high water, and the ebb at the time of low water by the shore. From the northern part of cape Levi race to two or three miles in the offing, the direction of both streams, during their"], [403, "Chap. Vin.] CAPE BARFLEUR. \u2014 LIGHT. \u2014 RACE. 381 greatest strength at springs, is East and West, and the rate of the flood is from 34_ to 4 knots, the ebb something less. Outside and amongst the Sen and Renier shoals, their direction is E.S.E. and W.N.W., and their rate about the same ; but, as the meridian of cape Barfleur is approached, the flood stream inclines more to the South east and its strength increases. At 2 miles northward of cape Barfleur, the flood runs S.E. 5 or 6 knots ; the ebb, N.W., with nearly equal velocity ; see also Table, page 383. CAPE BARFLEUR and LIGHT.\u2014 Cape Barfleur, or pointe de Gatteville as it is frequently called by the French, is the western extreme of the Baie de la Seine ; it is a low point, off which in a S.E. by E. direction at about one mile, as also on its north-western side, are some rocks which uncover at low water. Two towers of unequal height, about 80 feet apart, stand at the extreme of the point and serve to mark its position by day. The highest or southern tower is the lighthouse, and exhibits a revolving white light, of the first order, which attains its greatest brilliancy every half minute. The light is 236 feet above high water, and may be seen in clear weather from a distance of 23 miles ; beyond a distance of 12 miles the eclipses are total between the bright faces, but within 12 miles there is a faint continuous light. Semaphore. \u2014 The northern tower on cape Barfleur was the first built, and served as the lighthouse until the year 1836 when the southern tower took its place ; the northern tower has been converted into a semaphore station. When the sun shines on these towers the lighthouse may be seen 15 or 16 miles distant, and the semaphore tower at 11 or 12 miles. They are difficult to distinguish when at some distance north eastward of them on account of the high land at their back ; this land, however, has a remarkable break in its formation, which assists to mark their position ; \u2014 it is the valley of the little river Saire, called Coupee du Vaast, which lies S.W. by W. 4 W. 54^ miles from the lighthouse. Pernelle hill is also a remarkable object, and attracts particular notice by means of the church on its summit ; it bears S.W. by S. 4\u00a3 miles from the lighthouse, and when seen from S.S.E., N.N.E., or N.N.W., it has the appearance of a promontory sloping gradually towards the sea. BARFLEUR RACE. \u2014 This race is occasioned by the violence with which the tidal streams rush over the rocks forming a submarine"], [404, "382 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. VIII. extension of cape Barfleur. These rocks are based on the flat joining the land and extending about a mile, from East to S.E. from the lighthouse, as far as the line of Pernelle and Monfarville church towers in one. They form three separate reefs ; the first, with from 7 to 25 feet water, extends E. by N. half a mile from the light house ; the second, separated from the first by a deep called the Breche-du-Raz, has a rock with only 17 feet water lying E. 4 S. about 65 cables from the lighthouse ; the third, named the Ridin de Quenanville, is southward of the others and separated from them by another deep about 4 cables wide. This latter reef, 2 cables wide, extends half a mile in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, and its shoalest spot of 7 feet lies with Reville church spire on with the western side of a cluster of houses at the chateau of Monfarville ;* and, the guard-house on the summit of the eastern point of Roubaril cove touching the southern part of the highest of the houses (light keepers' dwellings), about 14 cables south-westward of the lighthouse. Barfleur race is especially dangerous at springs, when the streams run through at the rate of 8 or 9 knots, and, with a fresh wind, and especially with strong north-easterly gales, the sea breaks violently throughout its whole extent. The broken water in the race, however, depends generally upon the velocity and the hour of the tide, and it sometimes extends to a great distance in an easterly direction from the lighthouse. At neaps, the streams are not so strong and the race is quieter. At slack water, and with a moderate breeze, the extension of the race is only a strong rippling, and the most agitated part of it is not more than 2 or 3 cables wide. Fishermen, under these circumstances, cross it, passing through the Breche-du-Raz. Barfleur pilots also take small vessels through it at this time ; and, to do so, they only carry sufficient sail to steer well, so as to avoid the broken water and to keep the vessel's head to the sea. Vessels entering the Baie de la Seine from the westward, should avoid Barfleur race by giving the cape a berth of at least 2 miles in rough weather, and of 14^ miles in fine weather. * This chateau stands one mile southward of Barfleur church, and being of a brown colour it contrasts strongly with the trees surrounding it."], [405, "Chap.

Cape D'Antifer - - - 17\u00b0 10' W. BAIE DE LA SEINE is the deep bight comprised between cape Barfleur and cape D'Antifer, which latter bears from the former E. by S. 5 S. southerly, distant 55 miles. The coast of the bay recedes from this line about 24 miles towards the mouth of the river Orne, and its circuit, without taking into account the shores of the Seine estuary and of the Grand Vay, is about 96 miles.* It is open to all winds from N.W. round by North to N.E., and a heavy sea is thrown into it when they blow with any strength. At springs, the tidal streams, as described at page 452 (see also Table, page 454) run at the rate of 3 or 4 knots, and all the harbours within its circuit, except Havre, become completely dry before low water ; during neaps, there is little water in any of them even at high water, and they are, consequently, not then accessible to vessels of deep draught. A vessel embayed here, therefore, during strong northerly winds is in a dangerous position. All the indentations'of the shores of the bay, which lie out of the fair line of the tidal streams, are blocked up by sand and by the accumulations deposited by the rivers. The principal headlands and harbours are well lighted, and thus distinctly marked at night ; but, unfortunately, the lights as well as the characteristics of the coast by day, are frequently obscured by haze and fogs, which at times prove very embarrassing. THE COAST.\u2014 From cape Barfleur, the coast trends southward 5| miles to pointe de Saire ; it is generally low and of rocky granite formation with reefs extending some distance from the shore. Seen from the offing the land here appears well wooded, church steeples * See Admiralty Chart :\u2014 North Coast of France, sheet XI., Barfleur to cape D Antifer, No. 2,618, scale, m = (>\u2022\"> inch."], [407, "Chap, ix.] BAIE DE LA SEINE. \u2014 SOUNDINGS. 385 showing here and there above the trees. As previously mentioned, Pernelle hill and church, three miles north-westward of Saire point, is a conspicuous object on this part of the coast. From Saire point, the land falls back westward, forming at three miles southward of that point the Rade de la Hougue ; the little ports of Barfleur Reville, St. Vaast, and La Hougue, all lying between cape Barfleur and the Grande Rade de la Hougue. From La Hougue, the shores of the bay are generally low and sandy, with off-lying shoals and sand-banks in the western part ; but, eastward of Maisy point, it is more diversified, and, in the neighbour hood of point Percee, which bears S. by E. i E. easterly 224, miles from cape Barfleur, are high chalk cliffs visible 12 or 15 miles distant. The ports of Carentan and Isigny are in the deep bight of the Grand Vay, westward of point Maisy. From point Percee, point Beuzeval, which may be considered the southern boundary of the estuary of the Seine, bears S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. 33^ miles, the intervening coast, described hereafter in detail, consisting partly of cliffs of chalk or of rock and brown clay, and partly of low sand-hills with a moderately high and well cultivated interior. The ports within this space are, Port-en-Bessin, Courseulles, Oyestreham, and Caen, the latter 9 miles above Oyestreham on the river Orne, and the river Dives just westward of the Beuzeval hill. From Beuzeval point, the white chalk cliffs of cape de la Heve bear N.E. \\ N. 13 miles, the whole intervening space being occupied by the shallows, banks, and channels of the entrance of the Seine, on the southern shore of which is the harbour of Trouville, and the ports of Honfleur and Quilleb\u0153uf ; whilst, on the northern shore, is the large and important port of Havre, with Harfleur and others, the river being navigable for large vessels as high as Rouen. From cape de la Heve, the chalk cliffs forming the coast line trend almost directly N.E. \\ N. northerly 11 miles to cape D'Antifer, the shore being safe of approach within one mile for the whole distance between the two capes but without port or harbour of any descrip tion. SOUNDINGS.\u2014 The depths in the Baie de la Seine are very regular, varying, in line between cape Barfleur and cape D'Antifer, from 24 fathoms near the former to 18 fathoms near the latter, and from those depths decreasing very gradually towards the off-lying banks in the south-western part of the bay, towards the southern and eastern shores, and towards the extensive flats off the mouth of the Seine.

PORT BARFLEUR.\u2014 The entrance to this little port bears S.\u00a3W. 14; miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse, and its position is clearly indicated by the church standing on the northern point of entrance. The port is only 3 cables long and 2 cables wide, dries at low water, springs, is sheltered by the land from South round by West to N.N.E., and is protected from the sea during strong easterly winds by the Antiquaires and other rocks lying in front of the entrance.* A small jetty of stonework extends 53 yards in a southerly direction from the northern point of entrance, and a breakwater or jetty, 220 yards long, extends N.N.E. 4. E. from the southern entrance point ; the head of the northern jetty bears from the outer end of the breakwater or southern jetty about W.N.W. more than half a cable distant. The bottom of the port is generally mud, mixed with broken shells, sand, and gravel, and good for vessels taking the ground, but there are some rocky patches which should be avoided. The best and most commodious berths are near the entrance, where the bottom is soft and the tide rises higher than elsewhere ; vessels using them must moor securely to the large iron rings fixed in the rocks, as they are exposed to easterly winds, and to the sea, at springs, when the Antiquaires rocks are covered. Vessels loading or unloading lie alongside the North quay where the bottom is 4 feet above the lowest tides ; the bottom over the rest of the port is from 4 to 10 feet above that level. Alongside the North quay, there are from 16 to 17 feet at high water springs, from 18 to 20 feet at equinoctial springs, and from 9 to 10 feet at neaps ; vessels of less than 9 feet draught can, therefore, enter the harbour at high water with any tide. The port of Barfleur has 420 yards of substantial stone-built quay frontage, but its distance from any railway makes it of no commercial importance. Its trade, carried on by small coasters, is represented by about 100 vessels of an aggregate of 3,150 tons entering annually, and, of these, about half enter in ballast. Granite for building purposes is extensively quarried in its neighbourhood. The little traffic carried on is in flax, hemp, vegetables, fruit, butter, oysters, and fish. Dangers. \u2014 The outer danger in approaching port Barfleur is the Ridin des Dents, a rocky shoal on which is a dangerous patch with only 9 feet water about a mile from the shore, and bearing * See Admiralty plan -.\u2014Port Barfleur on Sheet XI., No. 2.613."], [409, "Chap, ix.] PORT BARFLEUR. 387 E. by S. 4 S. southerly from Gatteville church tower. The Anglais rocks bear about N.E. by E. 4 E. 4 cables from the North jetty end, and the Vinberge rock, the highest head, uncovers 7 feet. The Hintar rock E. by S. 4. S. nearly 2 cables from Vinberge rock, and, E.N.E. half a mile from the breakwater end, uncovers b\\ feet ; a large iron ring is fixed on it for the convenience of vessels warping into harbour or anchoring near it in the road. Buoys and Beacons.\u2014 On the northern side of the entrance, two red buoys, the outer having a staff and vane, mark the Anglais rocks ; they bear N.E. \u00a3 E. and S.W. \u00a3 W. distant 14 cables from each other, the Vinberge rock lying midway between them ; a red buoy marks the Ronde rock at the entrance, it is only a quarter of a cable from the breakwater end, and vessels entering must pass between it and the breakwater. On the southern side are, a black buoy with staff and vane marking the Hintar rock, two beacons marking respectively the Raie and Grosse-Haie rocks, and a black buoy marking the Hoisier rock near the breakwater. There is also a third beacon marking the Fourquie rock a short distance south-eastward of the entrance. A Life-Boat is stationed at port Barfleur. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed ivhite lights, dioptric and of the fifth order, are exhibited from square towers, one, 23 feet above high water, on a point on the southern side of the harbour, If cables within the breakwater end ; the other, at the head of the harbour, 43 feet above high water, and bearing S.W. by W. 4 W. 309 yards from the former ; both may be seen in clear weather from a distance of 9 miles, and when in line they lead to the entrance. Two small fixed red lights are also shown, one near the head of the breakwater or southern jetty ; the other, near the head of the northern jetty. These two red lights in line lead through the southern passage up to the harbour entrance. Fog\" Bell. \u2014 The bell of the white church of St. Vaast at Barfleur is sounded continuously during foggy weather for one hour about the time of high water. (See note, page 10.) Directions. \u2014 A vessel rounding cape Barfleur from the west ward and bound to port Barfleur, after passing the swell at the outer end of Barfleur race, should take care not to go westward of Pernelle and Monfarville church towers in line bearing S.W., unless of very 2B 2"], [410, "388 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. light draught, or unless the tide has risen considerably. The two harbour lighthouses by day, or lights by night, in line bearing S.W. by W. \\ W. lead through the channel to the port between the western rocks of the Antiquaires reef and the dangers bordering the shore between cape Barfleur and the northern point of the port, leaving on the starboard hand the three red buoys already described, and on the port hand the black buoys and beacons. The channel narrows considerably between the Hintar and the Anglais rocks, and, from thence to the entrance, it is only 120 yards wide. At the entrance, it is only about 50 yards wide between the Ronde buoy and the head of the South jetty or breakwater. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels arriving before high water with off-shore winds, may anchor in Barfleur road, which is a small deep between the Plateau des Antiquaires and the Gaillarde and Anglais rocks. The best anchorage is in about 5 fathoms, good holding ground, with the lower leading light a little open to the left of the higher light, or with Pernelle and Monfarville church towers in line S.W. ; and, Crabet mill, without sails, just open northward of Masse point. This anchorage should be used during off-shore winds only and in fine weather ; should a vessel, however, be surprised in it by strong northerly or easterly winds, she must moor with open hawse to the northward, and with the heaviest anchor to the eastward ; the anchorage being of small extent, it will be necessary to shorten in and tauten the cables as the water falls to prevent tailing on the rocks. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port Barfleur at 8h. 59m. ; at the foot of the North quay, equinoctial springs rise from 18 to 20 feet ; ordinary springs, 17 feet ; and, ordinary neaps, 13 feet. Neaps range 9 feet. The tides are very regular, but with strong prevailing south-westerly winds the water rises higher, and, with strong and lasting winds in the opposite direction, remains lower than the general level ; this is also the case in all the harbours of the bay of the Seine. The mean duration of the rising tide is 5h. 50m., and of the falling tide 6h. 35m., but the duration of the rising tide between a neap and the following spring tide exceeds 6 hours and sometimes reaches 64; hours, whilst between a spring and the following neap it is below the mean. The first part of the flood stream follows the direction of the shore from cape Barfleur, and crosses the road and channel. Its greatest rate does not exceed 3 knots and it decreases suddenly at"], [411, "Chap, ix.] 389 PORT BARFLEUR. \u2014 MOULARD ROCK. about half flood, when an eddy commences in the opposite direction but with rather less speed. This eddy is weak about high water, but its rate increases as soon as the tide begins to fall. Moulard Point is low and bears S. by E. \\ E. 1\\ miles from Barfleur church. Rocks which uncover at low water lie off the point, and rocky ground with shoal patches extends about a mile from the shore. The Basse Orientale du Moulard is the outer or eastern patch ; it has 26 feet water, lies E. 4_ N. 9 cables from the Moulard rock beacon turret, and, from it, Crabet mill is on with the northern extreme of l'llet at Barfleur. Vessels should keep a mile from the coast between Barfleur and this point whilst the Moulard rock is uncovered. The Moulard is a granite rock on which stands a white beacon turret If cables south-eastward of Moulard point ; this rock uncovers 23 feet at the lowest tides, and is a useful and necessary mark to all who navigate along this part of the coast ; for, when it is covered and the sea smooth , there is water for large vessels over all the hidden dangers between cape Barfleur and La Hougue. Pointe de Saire * is the first prominent point southward of cape Barfleur ; Pernelle hill rises N.W. by W. 3 miles from the point, the church on its summit forming the most remarkable object on this part of the coast. Reville battery is at the extreme of Saire point, and one of the lights used in entering La Hougue r#ad at night is shown from its south-western face ; see page 392. Ridins des Ecraoulettes are sand-banks about a mile from the shore a little northward of the church towers of Pernelle and Reville in line, with not less than 28 feet on their shoalest parts ; Gatteville church tower and the Moulard rock beacon turret in line N.N.W. 4.

With an on-shore wind, the sea runs very high on this bridge as long as the tide makes north-eastward, i.e., from half flood to low water by the shore. Basses de Reville and de Pernelle. \u2014 Several rocky patches lie outside the Pont de Saire, but they are dangerous only in bad weather. Those farthest out are, the Reville with 27 feet, and the Pernelle with 36 feet water. They are 5 cables apart and both lie with Barfleur lighthouse on with Moulard rock beacon turret N. \\ W., the Reville 1\\ miles, and the Pernelle 1\u00a3 miles from Saire point ; the western mark for the Pernelle is, Morsaline light house showing southward of Fort de l'Het W. \\ N. northerly. The Coast. \u2014 From Saire point, the direction of the coast changes and trends south-westward. St. Vaast point, on which stands the church of the small town from whence the point takes its name, bears S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. 1\u00a3 miles from Saire point, and the intermediate coast forms a deep bight, at the head of which the waters of the little river Saire, after winding round the northern side of Pernelle hill, lose themselves on a low sandy beach. The fortified island of Tatihou, the small Fort de l'llet on the rocks close southward of that island, and the rocks which surround them, partly close the entrance to this bight ; at low water, they join the mainland by a beach of gravel, sand, and rock ; the whole of the bay from St. Vaast point to the outer rocks of the lie de Tatihou and from thence to La Hougue point being dry, or nearly so, at the lowest tides. The narrow rocky peninsula of La Hougue extends one mile S.W. from St. Vaast point. Fort La Hougue occupies its southern and highest part ; near its centre on the western side is the remarkable old round tower of La Hougue. Westward and north ward of the fort is a sandy bay, one mile in depth and width, but which, at low water, dries completely out to and beyond the extreme point of La Hougue. ST. VAAST.\u2014 This small tidal harbour is on the northern side of St. Vaast point, northward of a jetty of masonry extending E. 4 N\u2014"], [413, "Chap, ix.] 391 THE COAST. \u2014 ST. VAAST. 440 yards from the shore, and with an iron lighthouse at its end. From South round by West to North it is sheltered by the land and by this jetty ; and, from the high sea and strong winds from the eastward, by Tatihou island. To protect the harbour from north easterly winds, two breakwaters of rough stone have been constructed ; of these, the South breakwater is 280yards in length N.N.W. and S.S.E.; the North breakwater, 176 yards in length and about North and South in direction. From the northern end of the South breakwater, the southern end of the North breakwater is distant only about 60 yards in an easterly direction, thus overlapping the South breakwater when approaching from the north-eastward. The entrance to the harbour is either between these two breakwaters, or round the end of the South breakwater, between it and a small jetty running off in a north-easterly direction from the main jetty to protect the building and repairing slip just within it. Both entrances are narrow, but the last named is that generally used and is 130 feet wide. The quay frontage is very extensive considering the requirements of the port, being no less than 470 yards in length. The bottom of the harbour is a mixture of sand, gravel, and a little mud, great quantities of rock having been removed and levelled ; the berths are good alongside the quays, but farther off they are hard, the rocks being thinly covered ; here small vessels have to be supported by their legs, and vessels of greater burthen by heaps of fagots placed under their bilges. On the western side, the bottom dries 6 feet, and, on the eastern side, 4 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; at high water, ordinary springs, there are at the berths from 13 to 14 feet water, and, at the lowest neaps, 7 to 8 feet ; the harbour is, therefore, inaccessible to vessels over 12 feet draught under any circumstances. The town of St. Vaast communicates by road through Barfleur with Cherbourg, from which it is distant 24 miles, and from Valogne it is distant by road 114; miles. It contains about 3,500 inhabitants, and the formation of the port, which is entirely artificial, was only commenced in the year 1826. It has a fine hospital, considerable oyster and other fisheries, and its chief foreign trade is with England for coal, and with the Baltic for timber About 800 vessels, including fishing craft and coasters, of an aggregate of 35,000 tons, enter the port annually ; the exports are chiefly fruit and cattle, but are unimportant, vessels usually leaving in ballast. The southern passage to the harbour is between the rocky ridge extending southward from the jetty to La Hougue fort on the"], [414, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap.

Fog signal. \u2014 A bell is sounded continuously in foggy weather at the outer end of St. Vaast jetty. (See note, page 10.) A Life-Boat is stationed at St. Vaast Directions. \u2014 When bound into St. Vaast harbour, Morsaline lighthouse about a quarter of a point open southward of La Hougue lighthouse W. by N. \u00a3 N. leads 2\\ cables southward of the 15-feet patch on the Ouest-Drix flat, and when the spire of Reville church opens westward of Fort de l'llet, steer for the end of the jetty, taking care to give a good berth to the remains of three wrecked vessels lying south-westward of Fort de l'llet. Morsaline lighthouse, exactly midway between La Hougue lighthouse and the large tower in the middle of La Hougue fort, leads between the Ouest-Drix patch and the Gavendest ; but, this passage should not be attempted when the sea is heavy, nor should it be used by a stranger at night. It is difficult to leave St. Vaast harbour with the wind between S.W. and S.E., both flood and ebb running to the northward ; but, even with those winds, small vessels with good pilots may leave the harbour at high water, springs, and pass out northward of Tatihou island, keeping about a cable from its northern shore in passing. Tides. \u2014 During the whole of the flood, the stream runs northward between St. Vaast jetty and Tatihou island, and, with the falling tide, it follows the same direction until the highest part of the beach joining that island to the land is uncovered, which is at about half ebb. With both streams, at their greatest strength, a strong eddy forms at the end of the jetty and extends over the whole harbour, and with a fresh wind from North to N.E. there is a very confused sea within ; under these circumstances, vessels placed too far from the jetty strike heavily before they float, and also before they ground on the ebb. Port de la Hougue is merely a grounding place, 4 cables long and one cable wide, westward and under the ramparts of La Hougue fort, which partially shelters it from easterly winds ; the water here is generally smooth, but there is considerable sea when it"], [416, "394 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. blows freshly from S.S.W. round by East to N.E. It admits vessels of about 14 feet draught at high water, springs, and of 9 feet draught at neaps, but since the completion of St. Vaast harbour it is quite deserted ; it might, however, afford useful shelter in bad weather to a vessel of moderate draught compelled to run ashore. The best grounding place is a cable distant from the fort, between the parallels of La Hougue tower and of the wooden storehouse at the foot of the glacis northward of the fort ; this space is bounded westward by a shallow channel which receives all the water flowing from the land. The bottom abreast of the tower dries 74_ feet, and from thence rises gradually towards the northern part of the bay. The bottom is hard, being a mixture of muddy sand and gravel, and yields but little under vessels when aground. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port de la Hougue at 8h. 42m. The tide rises abreast of La Hougue tower from 14 to 15 feet at springs, and from 74 to %\\ feet at the lowest neaps ; in the southern part, it rises 2 or 3 feet higher. Fresh winds from S.W. to West raise the tide a foot or two higher than in calm weather, and winds from N.E. to North have a contrary effect. DANGERS. \u2014 The following shoals must be avoided when approaching Port de la Hougue, especially if there is any sea on : \u2014 The Manquet, a small isolated rock which uncovers 6 feet E.S.E. a short half mile from La Hougue lighthouse, and which, from its advanced position, is much in the way of vessels navigating between La Hougue and St. Vaast. As already described, a black conical buoy is moored near the eastern edge of this rock. Roche Joly, the top of which uncovers 3 feet, bears W. by S. \u00a3 S. 64 cables from La Hougue lighthouse, and, at high water, the sea breaks on it in bad weather. Jean de la Dune is a small group of four rocky heads which only uncover at springs ; the highest head, awash at low water, bears S.S.W. \u00a3 W. 7 cables from La Hougue lighthouse. The summits of Jean de la Dune, the Joly, and another rock southward of it, are the highest heads of the Verdieres reef, a rocky flat, lying nearly parallel with the shore, and on which there is a heavy sea with on shore winds. Both the Roche Joly and Jean de la Dune are cleared by keeping Pernelle spire a little open eastward of the Du Loup white beacon, standing on the sands in port de la Hougue."], [417, "Chap, ix.] PORT AND RADE DE LA HOUGUE. 395 Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station in Fort de la Hougue, 110 yards north-eastward of the tower. RADE de la HOUGUE.\u2014 This anchorage is south-eastward of port de la Hougue, and, although the sand-banks in its vicinity are well known to be shifting, it affords good anchorage for vessels of deep draught. It extends westward as far as the spires of Reville and St. Vaast churches in line N.N.E., and, eastward, as far as the Ouest-Drix flat and the northern part of the Bane de la Rade ; its northern limit is the parallel of the Dent and Gavendest rocks, both marked by red buoys ; and, its southern boundary, the small sand-bank named the Haut-fond de la Grande Rade, on which the least water is 27 feet. The holding ground is good in almost every part of this anchorage, and vessels are well sheltered by the land from winds between S.S.W. and N-W-, which are frequent and dangerous in winter ; but, it is open to winds from N.N.E. to S.S.E., which, even when moderate, send in a troublesome swell, but when blowing with any strength raise a heavy sea. Vessels suspected of having contagious diseases on board are sent from all the northern parts of France to ride out their quarantine in this roadstead, and, at times, many such may be seen at anchor in it. The lazaretto is on the western side of Tatihou island. The Grande Rade is a small deep in the southern part of La Hougue road about 6 cables long in a N.E. and S.W. direction, and 2 cables wide, where large vessels may anchor in excellent holding ground. The best position is in the centre of the deep in from 7 to 8 fathoms, with the church towers of Pernelle and St. Vaast in one N. by W. W. ; and, the Bois de la Ville midway between Quineville church tower and a guard-house on the shore. The Petite Rade is the space included between the Grande Rade and the rocks off La Hougue fort, but good holding ground does not extend much eastward of the line of Reville light touching the south-eastern angle of Fort de l'llet. Between this limit and the Grande Rade, the bottom is of sand and broken shells, and the holding ground is indifferent ; fresh easterly winds also throw in a heavy sea. Pilots anchor vessels in about 4 fathoms, good holding ground, in the space which has the following limits : \u2014 Quetehou church tower on with La Hougue point ; Morsaline and La Hougue lighthouses in line ; and, Reville lighthouse open a little eastward of Fort de l'llet."], [418, "396 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. From this anchorage, vessels of moderate draught may, if necessary, run for refuge into port de la Hougue. If drawing over 9 feet, however, and therefore unable to enter either St. Vaast or port de la Hougue during the lowest neaps, such vessels should anchor in the northern part of La Hougue road, where the holding ground is good, and they are in some degree sheltered from strong north-easterly winds and sea by Tatihou island and the rocks southward of it. Bane de la Rade. \u2014 This bank, of which the northern portion bounds the Rade de la Hougue in a south-easterly direction, is, within the 5-fathoms line, 3\u00a3 miles long N. 4. W. and S. \\ E. and, abreast of its shoalest part one mile from the northern end, three quarters of a mile wide. There are from 11 to 15 feet on the shoalest parts ; and the northern end, where there are 19 feet close to the 5-fathoms edge, lies one cable eastward of Reville spire on with the tower on Tatihou island ; and, with La Hougue lighthouse bearing N.W. \u00a3 W. From this point, the Haut-Fond du Bane de la Rade, a bank with from 4\u00a3 to 5 fathoms, extends in a north-easterly direction about 6 cables, to where cape Barfleur and Reville lighthouses are in line N. 4 E. ; and, La Hougue lighthouse bears W.N.W. Directions. \u2014 The entrance to La Hougue roadstead is between the shoal spot of 15 feet on the Plateau du Ouest-Drix and the northern part of the Bane de la Rade, sometimes called the Bee shoal, which bear from each other N. \u00a3 W. and S. \u00a3 E. distant 9 cables. Approaching La Hougue road from the northward, the mariner should take care that his vessel is not drifted southward of it by the flood stream, which, from the extreme of Barfleur race to about 3 miles off Saire point, runs southward, following the direction of the coast, at the rate of 3 knots, at springs ; close to Saire point, it changes its direction suddenly to the South-west. Vessels of deep draught should keep outside the off-lying shoal patches by attending to the marks already given for clearing them. When southward of the shoal water off Saire point, and to avoid the dangers eastward of Tatihou island, cape Barfleur lighthouse must be kept open eastward of Reville lighthouse until Morsaline and La Hougue lighthouses are in line, then steer about W.S.W. for the Grande Rade. Running in on this course near low water, cape Barfleur light will be hidden for a few moments by Tatihou tower ; directly it re-appears westward of the tower bearing N. by E. a vessel should anchor.

Tidal Streams.\u2014 In the middle of La Hougue road, the stream of flood, at springs, begins about 4\u00a3 hours before high water in the port, see page 394, and runs about W.S.W. It attains its greatest rate, 2\\ knots, about 2\u00a3 hours before high water in the harbour, and its mean duration is 5h. 20m. The ebb stream commences about 25 minutes after high water in the port, its mean duration is 7h. 10m., its direction N.E. and E.N.E., and its greatest rate, 24. knots, occurs about 4h. 20m. after high water. ILES ST. MARCOUF.\u2014 These two islands and the rocks round them which uncover at low water, with the Bastin rock, are nearly midway between port de la Hougue and the entrance to the Grand Vay, their outer edge being upwards of 4 miles from the coast, and they occupy a space about 8 cables long E.N.E. and W.S.W. and 2\\ cables wide. They are but little above the level of high water, but the fort and especially the large case-mated tower on the highest point of the ile du Large, or eastern island, may be seen from 9 to 12 miles distant. These islands, distinguished by the names ile du Large and ile de Terre, are separated by a narrow channel, in which it would be dangerous to anchor in bad weather, as the tidal streams run through with great rapidity ; but, a coasting vessel having missed La Hougue road, with a strong north-westerly wind and flood tide, may anchor during the remainder of the flood in a small bight, named Mannette, on the southern shore of the ile de Terre, provided she is moored securely and steadied by a hawser to the shore, for the eddies formed by the points of that island occasion a heavy sea. LIGHT. \u2014 An occulting white light of the fifth order, eclipsed every four seconds, is exhibited from the fort on the ile du Large, the eastern St. Marcouf island, at 56 feet above high water ; in clear weather, it is visible from a distance of 9 miles. Bane de St. Marcouf extends 3 miles in a N.N.W. direction from St. Marcouf ile du Large, and the soundings vary from 26 to 34 feet between it and the southern part of the Bane de la Rade, which lies three quarters of a mile nearer the land. Both banks"], [420, "398 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. consist of large masses of sand and broken shells, the Bane de St. Marcouf having from 7 to 12 feet on its shoalest parts. The tides cross them obliquely, and occasion strong eddies even in calm weather, and with easterly winds or northerly gales the sea breaks violently upon both banks from half ebb to half flood. St. Marcouf bank has off its northern end a narrow ridge of sand, or Haut-fond, running about If miles in an easterly direction nearly at right angles with the Bane de la Rade, with 4\u00a3 fathoms at its eastern extreme and from 54. to 7 fathoms at other parts, and from 10 to 8 fathoms on either side close to ; as it lies nearly across the tidal streams, the eddies produced by this narrow bank, at springs, cause a high sea when it blows hard. St. Marcouf light bearing S. by W., or, cape Barfleur lighthouse open eastward of the Moulard rock beacon turret, lead outside this bank. Bane du Cardonnet extends in a S.E. direction 64^ miles from St. Marcouf ile de Terre to about N. by E. \\ E. easterly 3^ miles from Grand Camp church, and forms, at about 4 miles from the coast, a barrier in front of the Grand Vay ; from its south-eastern extreme in 6 fathoms, Colleville church tower is on with point Percee S.S.E. 4 E. easterly. The bank consists of sand and broken shells, and its shoalest spots of from 4 to 10 feet extend from West to S.S.E., about a mile from the island ; it slopes gradually towards the South, but its northern side is steep-to, which causes the sea to break with great violence on it with strong winds from the northward or east ward, or when there is much swell on, and especially during the ebb tide. Farther eastward towards the meridian of Maisy church, the depths on the bank vary from 14 to 17 feet, and the water gradually deepens towards its south-eastern extreme. CHANNEL between ILES ST. MARCOUF and the COAST. \u2014 The south-eastern entrance to this channel is about on the meridian of the old ruined mill at Criqueville, and it terminates north-westward at La Hougue roadstead ; it is deep, having 9 fathoms at its south-eastern entrance, gradually shoaling to 54; or 6 fathoms in the North-west, and for deep draught vessels its navigable width is from 1 to 2 miles. It affords good anchorage in moderate weather and with off-shore winds, except W.S.W. of St. Marcouf islands where a rocky bottom about three quarters of a mile wide almost crosses the channel from the shore, and also E.S.E. and S.E. of Quineville, where the rocky shoals of St. Floxel of 4 fathoms water extend If miles from the land. The anchorage"], [421, "Chap. IX.] fLES ST. MARCOUF.\u2014 SHOALS.\u2014 CHANNELS. 399 in the south-eastern part, off the entrance to the Grand Vay, is known as Capelle road. The dangers to be avoided at low water are, the north-western part of the Cardonnet, which forms a small bank with from 10 to 14 feet water lying in a N.W. and S.E. direction, three quarters of a mile westward of St. Marcouf ile de Terre ; the rocky shoals of St. Floxel, before mentioned, which extend from the land as far as Pernelle church open 2\u00b0 eastward of La Hougue tower ; and, the Bavequien rocks, which uncover at low water and border the beach from the parallel of St. Marcouf church as far as the bearing E.N.E. from Quineville church. Local authorities state that a well-found vessel might ride out a heavy gale from the north-eastward in this channel, under shelter of the high parts of the Cardonnet, the St. Marcouf, or the Rade banks, which break the violence of the sea ; it is, however, but precarious shelter and should only be resorted to as a last resource when a vessel is embayed and finds it impossible to gain an offing, for the sea in such weather is sure to be very heavy in the channel between the banks on the flood, and a breaking sea is caused by the weather tide on the ebb. If a vessel is obliged to bring up in this channel, such an anchorage should be chosen, that in case she parts or is compelled to run ashore, she may do so where there is some chance of safety for the crew. The Magdeleine bank at the entrance of the Grand Vay should be carefully avoided, as it is of hard sand, and a vessel running on it in bad weather would certainly go to pieces. Directions. \u2014 The channel between the St. Marcouf and Cardonnet banks and the coast may be taken, even at low water, if the weather is moderate and strict attention be paid to the lead. With a fair wind, point Percee and Huppain wood in line S.E. leads in the deepest water between the meridian of Maisy church and St. Marcouf ile de Terre. From thence, steer about N.N.W. until Pernelle church tower, bearing about N. \\ W., is 3\u00b0 or 4\u00b0 open eastward of La Hougue tower ; keep this mark on until Quineville church bears W.S.W., then haul out north-eastward for the Rade de la Hougue. Tidal Streams. \u2014 In the channel between the iles St. Marcouf and the shore, the rate of the streams, at springs, is about 3 knots, and their maximum rate is about the time of half flood and half ebb in port de la Hougue, see page 394. The direction of the flood through La Hougue road is W.S.W. ; at the northern end of"], [422, "400 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX.

In mid-channel, however, the flood stream runs nearly parallel with the shore from the rade de la Hougue as far as the meridian of the iles St. Marcouf, it then turns S.S.W. towards the entrance of the Grand Vay, beyond which it again follows the direction of the shore. The ebb is rather weaker than the flood and runs nearly in an opposite direction. At neaps, both streams are feeble except at the entrance of the Grand Vay. GRAND VAY. \u2014 The shore is flat and for the most part com posed of sand-hills from port de la Hougue to the entrance of the Grand Vay, which is an indentation of the coast in the south-western part of the Baie de la Seine ; it is about 4 miles wide and 6 miles deep, and at its head are the small tidal harbours of Carentan and Isigny. The entrance to this deep bight is about 5 miles south ward of the iles St. Marcouf ; it is choked with sand and would probably cease to be navigable but for the extensive harbour works and the periodical freshets from the small rivers Taute and Douve on its western shore, and, Vire and Aure on its eastern shore, whose channels afford sufficient depth for vessels of moderate draught to reach Isigny and Carentan at high tides. Formerly the tide flowed far into the interior, inundating the low lands bordering the rivers ; to remedy this, dykes were constructed at the mouth of each river, with flood gates which close with the rising tide. The church of Ste. Marie du Mont stands conspicuously 2\\ miles from the western shore, and the fine church spire at Maisy and the village and church at Grand Camp serve to mark clearly the eastern side of the entrance to the Grand Vay. Magdeleine bank. \u2014 The entrance to the Grand Vay is more than half closed by the Magdeleine bank, which uncovers at low water nearly 24_ miles from the western shore and is a continua tion of the sandy strand, half a mile wide, bordering the coast from port de la Hougue southward. The highest parts of this bank are scarcely covered at high water, neaps, and it is considered the most dangerous of the Grand Vay banks, for the streams cross it with great rapidity, and raise a heavy sea on a weather tide. The sand also of which it is composed is so hard that a vessel grounding on it in bad weather would have but little chance. Buoy.\u2014 A large bell buoy, painted with black and red bands, is moored off the northern edge of the shoal in about 12 feet water ;"], [423, "Chap.

W. 44 miles. The Ravine bank is an extension of Brevand point, dividing the lower courses of the rivers Taute and Vire. It extends as far northward as the parallel of Maisy point, its summit barely covered at spring tides and the greater part of its surface dry during neaps. The whole space between Maisy point and this bank is occupied by shifting sands ; that named the Feraillon is the only one that does not change its surface, being covered with gravel, beneath which there is said to be solid rock. There is little danger in grounding on the sands within the Grand Vay with smooth water during the dry summer season, for the tides then have but little strength ; but, during abundant rains or with equinoctial tides, the ebb stream is very strong and heaps up the sand under vessels aground, causing them to list over and capsize. MAISY POINT, the eastern point of the Grand Vay, is very low but defended against the heavy sea which sometimes rolls in by the Roches de Grand Camp, a ledge fronting the coast and extending 14^ miles westward and 2\u00a3 miles eastward of the point.

Capelle roads. \u2014 There is good anchorage off the entrance of the Grand Vay in Capelle roads, where, in moderate weather, vessels may remain until the tide has risen sufficiently to allow of their entering the narrows. This anchorage, about a mile in extent, is bounded westward by the line of Carentan church tower on with the eastern houses of Grand Vay hamlet ; eastward, by the rocky bottom which terminates in the direction of the small redoubt near the shore on with Maisy spire bearing S. \u00a3 W. ; and, northward, by the high land of Menil, which rises eastward of port-en-Bessin, on with point Percee ; the latter mark also leads outside the rocky ledge and dangers off Grand Camp.

At this anchorage, the flood runs S.S.W. and S.W. by S., and the stream changes about half an hour before high water. The most favourable time for entering the narrows is about 14, hours before high water, but, with a head wind, it is prudent to weigh in time to arrive abreast of Grouin point on the eastern shore of the Grand Vay before the commencement of the ebb. ISIGNY, on the eastern side of and 6 miles from the entrance of the Grand Vay, is on the river Aure which joins the Vire just below the town, both rivers being guided to the point of junction between dykes, and, from thence, in one channel in a N. by E. direction, also between embankments or dykes of rough stone, their inner ends above the level of the highest tides and their outer parts awash at high water, neaps. The eastern dyke extends for a distance of 3,046 yards, the western dyke being more than 600 yards longer and ending abreast of Grouin point and about 1\u00a3 cables from it. The width between the dykes at the entrance is 102 yards and it narrows to 92 yards at their inner end ; their whole tidal length is marked at short intervals by beacons, red on the starboard hand and black on the port hand in entering. At the town, the width between the quays is only 90 feet ; there is a stone quay 256 feet in length, two small unloading slips, and also building and repairing slips. The staple of the town is butter, of which a large quantity is exported annually, also grain, colza oil, and stone. The population is about 2,500, and the trade is represented by the entry of about 130 vessels annually, of an aggregate of about 9,000 tons. The high road from Paris to Cherbourg passes through Isigny, and, three miles distant from it, is a station on the Paris and Cherbourg railway. The harbour is reported to be gradually deepening since the com pletion of the dykes and embankments, the silting up during the summer, when there is but little water in the Aure, being more than counterbalanced by the scour of the freshets occasioned periodically by heavy rains. There are 134; feet at high water, springs, at the foot of the quay, and 19 or 20 feet in the channel between the dykes, Vessels may lighten, if necessary, during neaps, at Grouin or Beuzeville before proceeding up to Isigny. The Passe d'lsigny, between the western end of the Roches de Grand Camp and the Feraillon bank, is the channel leading from the sea to the dyke heads and thence to Isigny. It is well marked by"], [425, "Chap, ix.] PORTS ISIGNY AND CARENTAN. 403 buoys and beacons as far as Grouin point, from whence, as before stated, the submersible dykes between which the channel then lies are also marked by beacons at short intervals up to Isigny ; the dis tance from abreast of the inner black buoy of the Roches de Grand Camp to the dyke-ends is nearly 3 miles, and, notwithstanding all the aids to navigation, it is prudent for a stranger to take a pilot. LIGHTS. \u2014 There are at Isigny two fixed white leading lights, bearing N. by E. and S. by W. from each other, and 654 yards apart. They are dioptric, of the fourth order, and are respectively 26 and 43 feet above high water, and visible in clear weather from distances of 9 and 12 miles. The lower light is at the point of junction of the Aure and Vire rivers, and the two lights in line lead up the channel between the dykes. CARENTAN, on the river Taute, about 9 miles from the entrance and on the western side of the Grand Vay where the Vire and Taute canal terminates, has also a tidal harbour with a Bassin-a- flot or wet dock at its head. The Bassin-a-flot is entered by a lock 136 feet long, 40 feet wide, and with 17 feet 3 inches over the sill at high water, springs, and 11 feet 7 inches at neaps ; it is nearly 1,600 yards in length by 197 feet in width, its shores thickly planted with trees until near the town, at the upper end, where are 800 feet of substantial stone quay frontage ; the quays communicating by well- paved roads with the railway station about 400 yards distant, From the entrance of the Bassin-a-flot, dykes awash at high water, neaps, at all their outer part, like those of Isigny, the success of which led to the construction of these, extend no less than 7,000 yards, terminating abreast of the little village of Grand Vay. The width between these dykes or embankments at the entrance is 132 yards, narrowing to 71 yards near the upper end ; and, the depth between is 17 feet at high water, springs, and about 14 feet at neaps. The Carentan channel receives the waters of the Vire and Taute canal as well as of the rivers Taute and Douve, and its depth is main- tained and gradually increased by the extensive modern embankments assisted by the scour of these united streams. Entering from seaward, the channel commences near the Grand Vay bell buoy, see page 400, and is well marked on either side for nearly 3 miles up to the dyke-ends by numerous buoys ; the dyke-ends and the whole of their submersible parts are marked by beacons at short intervals, red buoys and beacons being left on the starboard hand in entering, black buoys and beacons on the port hand, as usual. The least water in the channel 2C2"], [426, "[Chap. IX. 404 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER, between the buoys at high water, neaps, is said to be 15 feet, but being very liable to change, it is dangerous to attempt it without a pilot ; for, to ground on any of the banks at the entrance of the Grand Vay with a strong north-easterly wind, or on the borders of the channel within the entrance during the rainy season when the ebb tide is very strong, would probably cause the loss of the vessel. The town of Carentan contains about 3,000 inhabitants and is the centre of a fertile grazing district ; it was formerly a fortress, but its ramparts have been levelled and ditches filled in. It has a handsome church and spire, manufactures of lace and cotton goods, and a trade in cattle, horses, hemp, flax, butter, building materials, &c. ; besides its coasting trade, the chief traffic is with Southampton and with Norway and Sweden. It is on the direct Paris and Cherbourg rail way, as well as communicating with Cherbourg, Granville, and other places by the national high roads. LIGHTS.\u2014 Two fixed leading lights on wooden scaffoldings are exhibited as a guide through the channel of Carentan : viz., a red light on the sea bank 16 feet, and a white light at Brevand 49 feet, above high water ; the upper ivhite light is distant 940 yards S.W. \\ W. from the lower and is visible in clear weather 7 miles ; the lower red light being visible 9 miles. The lights show through an arc of 32\u00b0, their maximum intensity being when in line, which is the leading mark for the channel. Tides. \u2014 The flood stream, at springs, loses its strength when the Grand Vay banks are covered. It crosses the Magdeleine bank with some rapidity, until 3^ or 4 hours flood, and inclines towards the inner banks, which renders the entrance to the channel somewhat difficult with a head wind. The beginning of the ebb is weak, but as soon as the banks begin to uncover its rate rapidly increases. The COAST.\u2014 From point Maisy, on the eastern side of the entrance to the Grand Vay, to point Percee, the distance is 54 miles, the general trend of the coast being about E. by S. \\ S. ; a mile east ward of Grand Camp church, the land suddenly rises and a perpen dicular chalk cliff about 400 feet high commences, which may be seen 12 or 15 miles off. The land above the cliff is level and without any conspicuous object on it except the church of St. Pierre du Mont, which stands in the midst of a clump of tall trees. From point Percee, cape Manvieux bears S.E. by E. easterly distant 114 miles, the little harbour of Port-en-Bassin lying between them ; and, nearly as far as St. C6me-de-Fresne chapel, 14 miles eastward of"], [427, "Chap. IX.] THE COAST. \u2014 POINT MAISY TO RIVER ORNE. 405 cape Manvieux, the land as seen from the offing appears nearly a level plain upwards of 400 feet above the sea, overtopped only by the church towers and groups of trees surrounding the villages. When nearer the coast, it presents a great variety of aspect ; the chalk cliffs continue to about a mile south-eastward of point Percee, and, from thence as far as the guard-house at Ste. Honorine, the high table-land recedes somewhat from the coast, the shore being low, sandy, and bounded by low sand-hills, in front of which is a beach of muddy sand and shingle about 2 or 3 cables. wide at low water. Between Ste. Honorine guard-house, and St. Come chapel, the shore is again precipitous, consisting of high cliffs of rock and brown clay intersected by narrow valleys, of which some are as deep as the level of high-water mark, but the greater part are only half the depth of the cliffs. Vessels of deep draught may approach to within a mile of the coast between point Percee and cape Manvieux without danger. Eastward of the chapel of St. C6me-de-Fresne, the appearance of the coast changes from cliffs of rock and brown clay to gracefully undulating hills, richly cultivated, and rising with a gentle slope behind the shore as far as the left bank of the river Orne. From cape Manvieux to the Semaphore near St. Aubin point, a distance of 84 miles, the coast trends E. by S. \u00a3 S. ; and, from thence, S.E. \u00a3 E. 74 miles to the mouth of the Orne at Oyestreham. In the vicinity of Courseulles, the entrance to which is If miles westward of St. Aubin Semaphore, the shore is again of low sand-hills, except in front of the village of St. Aubin, where its direction begins to trend more south-eastward. The highest parts of the Plateau du Calvados are joined to this part of the coast and render a near approach to it dangerous. The different parts of the coast may be recognized from seaward by the clumps of trees surrounding the villages and by the church towers appearing above them. Tailleville hill, south-eastward of Courseulles, is remarkable, as is also the hill at Amfreville on the eastern bank of the Orne, not far from the mouth of that river. Between the low water rocks in front of most of the villages along the coast, there exist small deposits of muddy sand and gravel, called Naus or Anneaux, which afford no shelter with northerly winds, but where, at the commencement of the fine season, the villagers fit out large fishing boats of from 8 to 10 feet draught, when laden. During the winter these boats remain either at Courseulles or in the Orne. Between St. Aubin point and Lyon, the shore is rather high : in other parts it is chiefly sand-hills."], [428, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. 406 Grand Camp is a little village on the shore between point Maisy and Criqueville and backed by a low hill ; its position is marked at night by the small fixed ivhite light described at page 401. It is an important fishing station, and the inhabitants, principally fisher men and sailors, fit out about forty boats of from 12 to 40 tons burthen, and of from 5 to 10 feet draught ; these boats are moored to buoys on a small sandy strand, dry throughout at low water, springs, and protected from the high sea with on-shore winds by the Grand Camp rocks. Some of the pilots for the Grand Vay reside in this village and others at Isigny. A Life-Boat is stationed at Grand Camp. Point Percee is the north-eastern point of the high chalk cliffs which border the shore from about a mile eastward of Grand Camp to a mile south-eastward of point Percee. The point projects but little and is remarkable only from the change in the direction of the coast. A flat of sand and gravel, divided into several parallel banks, extends about E.N.E. three quarters of a mile from the point ; the eddies occasioned by these banks, which lie across the tidal streams, cause a slight race on a weather tide, but it is not dangerous to decked vessels. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on point Percee. PORT-EN-BESSIN * is seven miles eastward of point Percee ; it is at the opening of one of the most considerable of the valleys which intersect the high cliffs of rock and brown clay on this part of the coast. The opening is about 130 yards wide between the cliff of Huppain on the West and of Castel on the East. Within the opening, the valley suddenly widens and forms a circular plain more than a mile in diameter, of which the level is from 15 to 20 feet above high water ; it is almost entirely surrounded by gently sloping hills. The shore in front of the valley is a steep beach of small pebbles and shingle, and, when the sea is smooth, affords a good grounding place for fishing boats, which are hove up out of the reach of the sea by capstans. Fronting this beach is a break in the rocks which border the shore, forming a natural basin, 140 yards wide and 2 cables long, with sand and gravel bottom, having 21 feet in it at high water, ordinary springs, and 27 feet at equinoctial springs. Since * According to a Notice to Mariners dated at Paris, February 2nd, 1888, the buoy of the Cubana, a ship foundered in 1862, 11 miles N. by E. J E. from Port-en-Bessin, is still in position."], [429, "Chap. IX.] 407 PORT-EN-BESSIN. 1845, and up to 1860, no less than \u00a31,000,000 has been expended in the attempt to transform this small natural basin into a harbour of refuge. Two massive moles, their bases 550 yards apart, extend from the shore, their ends curving towards each other and leaving an entrance about 110 yards wide ; the western mole is 500 yards in length, the eastern mole 35 yards less. Several mooring buoys are laid down within this space, but, with northerly winds, in weather when a vessel would require refuge, the sea is so high and the surf so great that it would be impossible to run for this harbour and unsafe for any vessel already in it. The village of Bessin has a population of about 800, it is con nected with the city of Bayeux, about 6 miles distant, by road, and, through it, with the general railway system; it has a large and grow ing fishery but its coasting and other trade is insignificant; a few small vessels of about 150 tons arrive annually during the fine season with coal from England and timber from the Baltic, and sail again in ballast. A Life-Boat is stationed at Port-en-Bessin. LIGHTS. \u2014 A fixed white lower light, visible 6 miles, is shown from a wooden staff at Port-en-Bessin at 90 feet above high water. An upper red or white tidal light 131 feet above high water is also exhibited S.W. southerly 79 yards from the fixed white lower light ; it shows red when there are less than 11 feet water on the banks within the port, and is then visible 9 miles. At all other times it shows white and is visible 14 miles, but whether showing ivhite or red it can only be seen within 18\u00b0 on each side of the centre of the channel, its brilliancy decreasing as its distance from the centre increases. Both upper and lower lights are catoptric and of the fifth order ; when in line they show the direction of the entrance. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Port-en-Bessin at 8h. 57m. ; equinoctial springs rise 26 feet; ordinary springs 20 feet; neaps 15^ feet. There are 27 feet water between the mole-heads at high water, springs, and 224 feet at neaps. Tide signals are made from a mast on the inner end of the eastern mole; they indicate the depth within that mole. At low water, abundant springs of fresh water issue from apertures in the rocks which dry at that time. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the cliff just westward of Port-en-Bessin."], [430, "408 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. Arromanches, a pretty little fishing village used as a watering-place by the inhabitants of Bayeux, stands on the sea shore at the entrance of a wide valley three quarters of a mile east ward of cape Manvieux ; and, as it is very conspicuous from seaward, it serves to point out the position of that cape, which otherwise has little to distinguish it but its height, and the steep cliff in which it terminates. The villagers fit out small half-decked fishing vessels which, by means of capstans, they heave up a shingle beach much resembling that at Port-en-Bessin. A rocky shore, which uncovers seaward nearly half a mile at low water and forms a point advancing in an easterly direction from cape Manvieux, arrests the sea during northerly winds, and diminishes the violence of the surf on the beach, which is otherwise very exposed. PLATEAU de CALVADOS.\u2014 This rocky flat commences just eastward of Arromanches, and extends 13 miles eastward along the coast, as far as Lyon. The parts of the flat which uncover are, the Calvados rock, from which the name of the flat is derived ; the Roches de Ver ; the Essarts de Langrune ; and, the Roches de Lyon. A tradition exists that a forest of chestnut trees, called the forest of Hautefeuille, originally covered the rocks which dry at low water between Bernieres and Lyon, and that its destruction took place about 300 years since ; roots of chestnut trees are said to be found in the tissues of these rocks, and they are so difficult to extract, and the wood so hard that it blunts the best tools. Calvados Rock is one mile from the shore, its north-western edge bearing N. by E. E. 14 miles from St. C6me-de-Fresne chapel. It is about half a mile long W.N.W. and E.S.E., and 3 cables wide ; its western part is highest, and uncovers 3 feet above the lowest tides. The chapel on with the spire of Bazanville church, which stands on the top of the hills two miles inland, bearing S. \\ W., leads three cables westward. The north-western end of the Plateau de Calvados bears N.E. by E. one mile from the western edge of the Calvados rock; it is steep-to, and, from this point, preserves a distance of from 1\\ to 2\\ miles from the shore as far as Essarts point, the north-eastern extreme of the flat, which lies 3 cables westward of Langrune and Douvres church spires in line bearing S.S.W. \u00a3 W. ; with Ver lighthouse bearing W. \\ N. ; and, Oyestreham semaphore, at the entrance of the river Orne, S.S.E. \\ E. easterly. From Essarts point, which is 24. miles from the shore, the"], [431, "Chap. IX.] PLATEAU DE CALVADOS.\u2014 ANCHORAGE. 409 edge of the flat turns sharply southward, and, approaching the coast within a mile, continues at that distance until it is lost beneath the sands which dry westward of the mouth of the river Orne. Essarts point is the most dangerous part of the plateau, having on it only 4 feet water and rising suddenly from a depth of 20 feet; it occasions a change in the direction of the tidal streams and causes a race, during springs, on a weather tide. There is but little water on all parts of the flat, and, the rocks being uneven, a heavy sea breaks on them when it blows hard from the northward. Buoys. \u2014 A black buoy is moored 5 cables N.N.W. from the north western edge of the Plateau de Calvados and rather more than one mile from the western edge of the Calvados rock. A red bell buoy is moored in 7 fathoms N.E. by E. one mile from Essarts point, with Langrune and Douvres spires in line ; and, the outer black buoy at the entrance of the Oyestreham channel S.S.E. 4 E. easterly 5\u00a3 miles. Caution. \u2014 Both the buoys marking this flat are liable to drift, therefore their being in position cannot always be depended on. Anchorage. \u2014 A small anchorage with good holding ground, named the Fosse d'Espagne, lies midway between Arromanches and the Calvados rock, in a small elbow formed by the steep western side of the Calvados flat. The best position in which to anchor is in about 20 feet water, with Crepon church tower seen between those of Mevaisnes and Asnelles ; and, the tall spire of Bernieres on with the houses of Ver hamlet nearest to Ver lighthouse ; this anchorage is entirely exposed to all but off-shore or moderate easterly winds. The soundings deepen rather suddenly outside the Calvados flat ; but, there is no good anchorage ground at a less distance than a mile from its deep western edge, or than 2 miles from its eastern edge. Directions. \u2014 Vessels of deep draught may approach to within about a mile of the shore, even at low water, between point Percee and cape Manvieux, but it is imprudent to stand in so near with northerly winds. Coasters keeping close in, with off-shore winds, should be on their guard against the gusts which proceed from the valleys. Good holding ground may be found at 2 or 3 miles from the coast, where vessels sometimes anchor to await the turn of the tide. The tidal streams follow nearly the direction of the shore, and their greatest strength, at springs, does not exceed 3| knots. In approaching the Essarts point of the Calvados flat from the eastward, keep northward of Ver church tower on with the clump of"], [432, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. 410 trees at Epine,* bearing W. \\ S., until Langrune and Douvres spires are in line S.S.W. \u00a3 W. In rounding the point from the eastward, keep Lyon church tower open westward of the western house of St. Aubin-d'Arquenay village, bearing about South, until the line of Langrune and Douvres spires in one is crossed. LIGHT.\u2014 Pointe de Ver lighthouse stands 800 yards inland upon the slope of a small hill 4\u00a3 miles eastward of Cape Manvieux and 10\\ miles westward of the entrance to the river Orne ; it is a square tower from which is exhibited at 138 feet above high water a fixed white light, varied by a bright flash every four minutes ; the flash is preceded and followed by a short eclipse which is not total when within the distance of 6 miles. The light is dioptric, of the third order, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 18 miles. By day, Ver lighthouse may be easily recognised in approaching it from eastward or westward ; but, between the bearings of S.E. and S.W., it is difficult to distinguish on account of the high land behind it, The light was established to give warning of approach to the Calvados flat and to afford means of avoiding that danger ; but, it is very useful to vessels from the westward with southerly winds bound to Havre, who, after passing cape Barfleur, sight this light, if possible, 9 or 12 miles distant, and, from thence, steer for the lights on cape de la Heve which then soon appear to the eastward. By this means, they avoid making the land too far northward of Havre and the consequent delay in entering their port. COURSEULLES. \u2014 This small tidal harbour, 24_ miles eastward of Ver lighthouse and 84_ miles westward of Oyestreham near the entrance of the river Orne, is in fact the channel through which the waters of the river Seulle are conducted, intercepted by a dam which forms the head of the inner harbour or Bassin-a-flot, in which they are retained or discharged at pleasure by means of sluices into the outer harbour, and from thence through the channel to sea. The entrance channel is between two wooden jetties running nearly parallel with each other ; the western jetty is 196 yards in length, the eastern jetty not quite so long. The width between them is only 122 feet at their outer end and 90 feet at their inner end, and there * This olump of trees, called the Bois des Epines, consists of a few large elms, is very conspicuous, and being used as a landmark, the local authorities are careful to preserve it. It stands at the foot of the hills between Ver lighthouse and the Chateau de Vaux, at nearly a quarter of a mile from the shore."], [433, "Chap. IX.] POINTE DE VER LIGHT.\u2014 COURSEULLES. 411 are 13 feet water on the bar 50 yards outside the western pier at high water, springs. The channel within the jetty-heads is somewhat deeper, though subject to temporary accumulations of sand, but, in ordinary weather, at high water, springs, it admits vessels of 10 or 12 feet draught. At the inner end of the jetties is the outer harbour, a mere widening of the channel between rough stone embankments, with numerous sets of berthing piles and extensive quays averaging 60 feet in width. The outer harbour is 635 yards long with a maximum width of only 49 yards. At its head is the entrance to the inner harbour or Bassin a-flot, which is by a single pair of flood-gates, with a depth over the sill of 14 feet at high water, springs, and 9 feet at neaps ; and, a width of 32 feet. Its length is 320 yards, and width 614 yards ; on its western side, a slip occupies a space of 1584^ yards. The depth in the Bassin-a-flot is about 14 feet 6 inches at high water, springs, and is lowered to about 10 feet at low water by the sluices before mentioned. It also has ample quay accommodation of very solid construction. Courseulles has the advantage of direct railway communication with Caen through the little town of Luc, a thriving watering place between Courseulles and Oyestreham, and, from thence, with the general system of France. Its trade, however, with the exception of a rather extensive fishery, is small, its imports being coal and Baltic timber, and its exports nil. The total annual tonnage entering the port, including a few small steamers, is about 28,000 tons. The waters of the Seulle are not sufficiently rapid or abundant to maintain a deep straight channel through the sands extending half a mile in front of the entrance and terminating seaward at the Ver rocks, the Germain rock, and the Essarts de Bernieres. The channel is distinctly marked as far as 2 cables outside the jetties ; beyond that distance, the water spreads out and flows in a number of small shifting streams. Buoys. \u2014 A black buoy with staff and ball is moored a little southward of the Marguerite rock, and about three quarters of a mile N. by E. from the jetty-heads ; the Marguerite rock is awash at low water. Nearer the harbour, the channel is marked by 3 buoys, viz., a red buoy to be left on the starboard hand in entering, a black buoy to be left on the port side, and, the third and largest, a buoy painted with red and black bands, farther out where the channel ceases to be well defined ; this buoy may be passed on either side. All these inner buoys are moored securely in order that vessels approaching"], [434, "412 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. the harbour with a head wind may use them for warping. To do this, they should contrive to get up to the outer buoy, where there are several feet more water than on the bar, a full hour before high water, and so have time to warp into harbour during the remainder of the flood. The sea is smooth at the entrance with southerly winds ; and, if the ebb prevents their entering, they may remain aground without danger. The sand frequently accumulates westward of the entrance, forming banks so high as to prevent access to the western jetty -head, except by the channel itself. This drifting of the sand renders it difficult and even dangerous to enter the harbour with stormy winds between West and N.N.W. when vessels have wind, sea, and also the flood tide on their broadsides. Winds between N.N.E. and E.N.E. cause much sea at the entrance, but vessels of suitable draught may always enter with those winds at high tide ; the services of a pilot are, however, always essential to a stranger. LIGHTS. \u2014 A. fixed ivhite light of the fifth order is exhibited at 30 feet above high water, from a mast on Courseulles western jetty head ; it is visible in clear weather 6 miles, but is said to be frequently hidden by fog and mist. A. fixed green light 25 feet above high water and visible 4 miles, is shown from an iron standard on the eastern jetty, 23 feet from the head. This light is exhibited only when there are less than 64 feet in the channel. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Courseulles at 9h. 7m. ; ordinary springs rise 20 feet, neaps 154 feet. Tide Signals. \u2014 The depth of water in the channel commencing at 6\u00a3 feet is signalled from a mast and yard erected on the shore near the inner end of the eastern jetty ; see page 8. Directions.\u2014 The mound and trees at Tailleville, the fine spire at Bernieres, and Ver lighthouse, are all excellent objects by which the position of Courseulles may be determined from a distance. With northerly winds, a vessel should run for the harbour either between the Germain rock, which uncovers 4 feet, and the Essarts de Bernieres ; or, between the Ver rocks and the Germain, which are separated from each other by channels, through which, with an on-shore wind, it is advisable to pass in order to avoid the sea which sometimes breaks on these rocks.

The layer of mud covering the rock at these anchorages is both deep and stiff. ORNE RIVER. \u2014 The river Orne has its source near Seez, and from thence it trends in a north-westerly direction until it enters the department of Calvados, where it turns to N. by E., in passing Caen ; here it becomes navigable, and, 9 miles below that town, finds its way into the sea between the sand-hills of Siege and Merville points, nearly 10 miles eastward of Courseulles and more than a mile eastward of Oyestreham church. At low water, the river formerly ran by winding channels through the wide expanse of sand which dries 2 miles out from the shore at the entrance. To obtain a greater depth of water, a submersible dyke, marked by beacons, was constructed, commencing just inside Merville point and extending 1\u00a3 miles in a north-westerly direction outside Siege point and ending about 1^ cables north-eastward of the pier-heads of Oyestreham, thus confining the stream to one channel, which, turning sharply round Siege point, flows between the land and the dyke for its whole length north-westward and, from thence, through the sands to the sea in front of Oyestreham in a general N. by E. direction. This channel, therefore, forms the entrance to Oyestreham and also to the river Orne itself ; but, since the construction of the direct * A rock with only 2} feet water has been found 109 yards westward of the buoy marking the Marguerite rock.

The sand-banks in the lower course of the river, and off its entrance, are shifting and change their height, shape, and position almost every tide, rendering it most imprudent to venture in without a pilot ; for, to ground on them would almost always involve the loss of the vessel. The parts least subject to change are those near low water mark ; they are always covered during neaps and only uncover a short time at springs. The banks formed on this part of the shore are named by the pilots battures, and, with strong northerly winds, there is a heavy sea on them on the flood and breakers on the ebb. The Oiseaux, the high banks on the western side of the entrance, have a decided tendency to extend eastward, thus slowly forcing the channel and its entrance in that direction. CAEN is 9 miles from the sea by the river, and 7^ miles by the canal ; it is at the confluence of the rivers Orne and Odon, is on the Paris and Cherbourg railway, and is a place of great importance, with a population in 1886 of 43,809. It may be con sidered a double port, having its wet dock or Bassin-a-flot entered by the Oyestreham canal, and its natural tidal grounding harbour in the bed of the river Orne, which also has an entrance into the Bassin a-flot, and some quay frontage but little used now. The Bassin-a-flot is rectangular, is entered from the canal by a lock 40 feet wide at the gates, is 622 yards in length by 55 yards in width, and has a general depth of 15 feet. It has good quays, steam cranes, and two careening slips for small vessels, but no dry dock. It communicates with an inner basin with 1350 yards of quays, on which rails are laid, and vessels unload direct into railway trucks. Coals may be obtained with facility, though not often required, at from 16s. to 18s. per ton, about 3000 tons being usually in stock. There is, however, a deficiency of general supplies for shipping, and also of store accommodation, considering the growing trade of the port ; and, facilities for repairs of machinery are very limited. The hospital of the hotel Dieu is open to sailors in case of illness or accident, a small fee only being required. In the year 1887, 541 vessels of an aggregate of 159,138 tons, arrived at Caen. The imports are chiefly coal and timber ; the exports, Caen stone, barley, colza oil, cake, &c."], [437, "Chap. IX.] CAEN. \u2014 OYESTREHAM HARBOUR. 415 OYESTREHAM HARBOUR\u2014 This harbour, which forms the entrance to the canal de Caen, was constructed to remedy the numerous difficulties presented to navigation at the entrance of the river Orne, and in its tortuous course to Caen ; it consists of a fine tidal basin with stone quays on either side 14; cables eastward of Oyestreham battery, communicating directly by means of the canal, already described, with the port of Caen ; through this canal, vessels of from 12 to 14 feet draught can proceed to that port, the ser vices of a tug being always obtainable at Oyestreham. The tidal basin is 320 yards long and 100 yards wide, forming, in the midst of the sand-hills, a small harbour which admits vessels of 17 feet draught ; at its head is a lock 328 feet long, 23 feet over the outer sill, and 54 feet wide, by which vessels bound for Caen enter the canal at high water. The tidal basin has for its entrance from seaward, a channel 409 yards long and 44 yards wide, enclosed between two jetties of unequal length, opening into the outer elbow of the channel of the Orne, as described at page 413. These jetties are built up to the level of high water, neaps, and the western jetty is the longest. Unfortunately, the volume of water discharged by the Orne, though aided by the recent lengthening of its submersible dyke and by periodical sluicings from the Oyestreham canal, is not sufficient to overcome the silting up at the pier-heads caused by the easterly drift of the sands, and, in November 1884, the authorities reported that the sand-bank marked by three beacons at the outer end of the western jetty, had extended 55 yards eastward, leaving only a narrow channel by the eastern jetty.* Buoys. \u2014 Two red buoys mark the western side of the channel leading to the entrance of Oyestreham harbour and mouth of the Orne, and four black buoys the eastern side. The outer red buoy is 5| cables from the western jetty-head ; the inner red buoy is moored a little eastward of the same jetty head. The outer black buoy bears N. by E. 4 E. easterly, nearly 14 miles from the western jetty-head, and may be passed close to on its * On the 18th April 1888, the French authorities again reported that this bank, after being completely removed by dredging in the preceding year, had again formed ; and, at this date, commencing from about 30 feet northward of the West pier-head, it extended along inside and against this pier until within about 64 feet of the extreme of the East pier; a large portion dries; its greatest breadth, about 64 feet, is midway between the extremes of the two piers, and the channel, by the East pier is no more than 95 feet wide."], [438, "416 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER.

The third black buoy lies close to the northern end of the submersible dyke and about E. by N. \\ N. 1\\ cables from the western jetty-head. The fourth black buoy, which is only useful to vessels entering the channel leading to Siege point, is about half a cable eastward of the eastern jetty-head and within the line of the submersible dyke. Pilots. \u2014 There are several pilots at Oyestreham ; it is said that they will meet a vessel, even during northerly gales, at a quarter of a mile outside the harbour's mouth. The channel leading to the entrance of Oyestreham harbour being so very liable to change, as before remarked, no vessel should attempt it without a pilot ; the depth, however, may be calculated approximately by deducting 8 feet from the known height of tide at Havre. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station at Oyestreham 34; cables westward of the jetties ; it is among the sand-hills and not easily made out. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Oyestreham harbour, at 9h. 38m. ; springs rise 21 feet, neaps 16 feet. With strong westerly winds for several successive days, the water falls less and rises higher ; with easterly winds, the contrary is the case. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual tide signals are shown from a mast near the western jetty-head ; see page 8. A Life-Boat is stationed at Oyestreham. LIGHTS. \u2014 A small green tidal light, of 4 miles range, is shown from a mast 66 feet from the western jetty -head ; it is lighted 3 hours before and extinguished 3 hours after high water. A red light, visible 4 miles, is shown from an iron post at the end of the eastern jetty. A while fixed light of the fifth order is shown from 3 hours before to 3 hours after high water, from an iron lighthouse, painted white, at the eastern side of the lock entrance at the head of Oyestreham tidal basin. This light is 64 feet above high water and visible 10 miles distant ; when seen between those at the jetty -heads, it leads in the best water when near the jetties. Fog Bell. \u2014 A bell is sounded continuously in foggy weather from the western jetty. (See note, page 10.)"], [439, "Chap. IX.] OYESTREHAM. \u2014 RADE DE CAEN. \u2014 RIVER DIVES. 417 Directions. \u2014 The most favourable winds for entering Oyestreham harbour are those from N.W. round by North to E.S.E. When they are moderate, the sea is not heavy on the banks, but it must be borne in mind that with sufficient water for entering, the tide is always running eastward ; however, with a good pilot and the wind anywhere between the points indicated, a vessel may enter the harbour by day or night without the aid of the steam-tug, leaving all black buoys on the port hand, and red buoys on the starboard hand. Without a pilot, on account of the shifting nature of the sands forming the channel, it should never be attempted by a stranger. RADE de CAEN, about 3 miles N.N.W. from Oyestreham jetties, affords good anchorage with off-shore winds for vessels wait ing tide to enter the harbour, but it would be dangerous to be caught there by strong winds from the opposite direction. The eastern limit of the road is the meridian of Oyestreham battery; its northern limit, Bernieres spire on with the houses on St. Aubin point ; and, its southern limit, Bernieres spire on with the small church tower at St. Aubin. Pilots usually place large vessels between these limits in about 6 fathoms water, with Luc church tower open half a point southward of Beny spire ; here, they can weigh and stand off-shore if the wind should veer to the northward. THE RIVER DIVES.\u2014 The entrance to this river lies about E. by S. 6 miles from Oyestreham jetties, the intermediate coast being composed of sand-hills, or dunes, several of which are sufficiently high to be recognised at the distance of 5 or 6 miles. A sandy strand, about half a mile wide at low water, borders the coast, but, in front of the river entrance, it now dries for 1\u00a3 miles and gradually increases in width. In fine weather and with no swrell, this river admits vessels of 11 or 12 feet draught, at springs, and 7 feet at neaps ; but, with much fresh water in the river, and when the channel and berths are washed out, or during equinoctial tides, vessels of 15 feet draught may enter with a smooth sea. At all tides, the few small vessels using this little harbour lie on the grounding places within the entrance and are well sheltered by Cabourg point. They are safe, although in an uneasy position, for, the bottom being stiff and unyielding, they cannot stand upright. Those that only remain one tide are placed on the left bank of the river, and those that take in or discharge cargo, alongside a small quay or near the steep bank of the Mauvais-Pas, at the foot of the Balise de Dives, a hillock near the entrance. A. 2771. Wt. 17197 2D"], [440, "[Chap. IX. 418 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. The waters of the Dives run out over the sandy strand just described. Attempts have been made by means of a sub mersible dyke to confine and deepen the channel, but with only partial success ; it trends N. \\ E. half a mile from the entrance and then inclines more easterly as far as the outer edge of the sand, which is abrupt and, with strong winds between North and West, causes a heavy sea at the entrance on the flood, and breakers as soon as the ebb stream begins to gain strength. The little harbour of Dives is by nature much better calculated to make a really good harbour than any of those previously described in the Baie de la Seine. It has, however, no railway connection, and its trade is entirely unimportant and declining. It is remarkable as being the port from which William the Conqueror embarked with his army for the conquest of England. Buoys and Beacons. \u2014 Three wooden beacons and four buoys, two red and two black, mark the entrance channel ; the two inner beacons are on either side of the channel near the shore, one at the western edge close to the foot of Cabourg point, the other about a cable from it on the eastern edge. The third beacon is also on the eastern side, 3 or 4 cables farther out. The beacons are seldom moved, but the buoys are shifted wmenever the course of the channel undergoes any decided alteration. There are, in addition, two beacons surmounted by discs on the shore which act as leading marks by day, as the lights do by night. The lower leading beacon is coloured red, black, and white ; and is close to the tower of the high light. The high leading beacon is on the slope of Beuzeval hill and is black. The lower beacon is move able, to suit the line of direction to the changes of the channel. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed red lights, visible 9 miles, through an arc of 32\u00b0, are established on the eastern side of the mouth of the river Dives ; when in line, they mark the fairway into the channel. The lower light is shown only so long as there is a depth of 6| feet or more. They bear about N. 4 E. and S. h W. from each other and are 195 yards apart ; they are respectively 148 and 10 feet above high water, the lower light being shown from a moveable wooden structure, the upper light from a stone turret. Directions. \u2014 Northerly winds are the best for entering the river Dives, but it is necessary to wait for high water, whatever the vessel's draught, except at springs, when with a smooth sea, small vessels may venture in an hour after high water, if there is wind enough to"], [441, "Chap, ix.] RIVER DIVES.\u2014 SEINE ESTUARY. 419 stem the tide. With off-shore winds, the entrance should only be attempted by small vessels, and they should be prepared for the heavy gusts coming down from the high land through the valleys. The pilots have no good boats for boarding vessels outside the entrance in bad weather. A vessel, therefore, compelled to enter the river with a strong northerly wind, must contrive to be about 14_ miles from the shore on the meridian of the Balise de Dives at high water. From thence, bring the leading beacons in line, and steer in between the entrance beacons, leaving the two black buoys and outer beacon on the port hand and the two red buoys on the starboard hand ; when near the entrance between the two inner beacons, a pilot will be met with to conduct her to the grounding place. Anchorage. \u2014 There is good anchorage off the entrance to the Dives 14 or 2 miles from the shore, where, in fine weather, a vessel may remain until there is sufficient water in the channel. With a turning wind into the river, it is necessary to anchor in order to retain a favourable position ; for, the velocity of the flood stream is here considerably increased by the indraught of the river Seine, and a vessel remaining under sail would be drifted to leeward of the entrance. No vessel should, however, remain at anchor unless the weather continues fine and the wind is off-shore ; should it come from seaward, with no certainty of entering the river at high water, it is necessary to weigh without delay and seek refuge either at Havre or Honfleur. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the river Dives at 9h. 39m. ; springs rise 21 feet, neaps 16 feet ; but, in the shoalest part of the channel abreast of the eastern beacon, where the bottom is 8 feet above the level of the lowest tides, the water rises about 16 or 17 feet at ordinary springs, 18 or 19 feet at equinoctial springs, and 7 or 8 feet at neaps. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the summit of point Beuzeval, about one mile eastward of the entrance of the river Dives. ESTUARY of the SEINE.\u2014 The low coast from the river Orne, consisting of sand-hills, terminates with the left bank of the river Dives, and the land suddenly rises upon its opposite bank. Beuzeval hill, which commands the entrance to the Dives, and cape de la Heve, which bears N.E. N. 13 miles from Beuzeval point, are the most western of the high lands between which lies the estuary of 2D3"], [442, "420 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. ix. the Seine ; and, an imaginary line drawn from Beuzeval point to cape de la Heve may be considered the boundary between the sea and river navigation. In fact, this line is approximately the western limit of the accumulation of sand and mud deposited by the waters of the Seine, forming dangerous shoals in the mouth of that river ; no vessel of deep draught should approach this limit, nor should small vessels, except during high water, unless bound to. Havre, Honfleur, Rouen, or any other port of the Seine. It is also in the neighbour hood of this limit that the flood stream of the river begins to acquire its strength.* The principal banks obstructing the mouth of the Seine are, the Trouville, the Ratier, the Amfard, the Hauts de la Rade, and the Eclat, the higher parts of which uncover at low water ; the two first are near the southern shore, the Amfard in the centre, and the two last near the northern shore, between Havre and cape de la Heve. In 1855, it was found that the Hauts de la Rade and the Eclat had not undergone any perceptible alteration since 1834, but the banks southward and eastward of them had altered considerably. The Amfard and Ratier banks divide the mouth of the Seine into three channels of about equal breadth, which, at low water, have no issue eastward and abut on the shifting sands, then uncovered, within the river. In these channels, the stream runs 7 or 8 knots at springs, and 4 or 5 knots at neaps, and vessels of deep draught should avoid approaching them during the flood, for if once they should be carried amongst these sands and ground on them, they would certainly be lost ; nor could they be saved by anchoring, for anchors will not hold in the shifting sand, and the violence of the stream, which increases its velocity in advancing eastward, is irresistible. The inner part of the estuary is encumbered by a vast mass of these shifting sands which dry when the sea retires, and through which the tidal streams and the waters of the river force a channel with so changeable a position that the interval of a few days only is sometimes sufficient to transport it from one bank of the river to the other. Vessels are exposed to great danger if they attempt this channel without the assistance of the pilots of Quilleb\u0153uf, who are specially appointed to conduct vessels above Havre and Honfleur. It is the duty of these pilots to watch the changes in the position of the banks, and to mark the actual direction of the channel by beacons, see page 422. Their principal stations are at Havre and at Honfleur, where they are always * See Admiralty charts: \u2014 Trouville to Dieppe. No. 2,612; scale, m = 0'5 of an inch ; Barfleur to cape d'Antifer.

At either of these places, vessels bound up the Seine can also procure steam-tugs, which are now generally used to ensure a speedy passage past the dangers of the lower Seine. The bed of the river being inclined towards the sea, the flood stream is checked for some time at the commencement of the rising tide, but as soon as the accumulation of water overcomes the obstacles in its way it rushes through the channels and over the banks, losing little of its rapidity until the banks are entirely covered ; it is then that the river becomes navigable. In summer, the ebb stream has rather less speed but runs longer than the flood ; during the rainy season, and at the melting of the snow, it has in general more strength than the flood. The channel of the Seine undergoes such frequent and extraordinary changes that a description of it would be entirely useless to mariners. We will therefore only give some general extracts from the \" Remarks on the Navigation of the Seine,\" by Mons. Bailly, Marine Surveyor : \u2014 \" The Seine is subject to the phenomenon of the Mascaret, or Bore, which by the mariners of the place is named the Flot. It takes place as soon as the tide begins to rise, and may be known by a sort of roller, which extends from one bank of the river to the other, and advances with greater or less rapidity according to the range of the tide. It is always accompanied by a loud noise, which announces its approach, and is followed by the undulations occasioned by the reflux of the waters of the river. At Quilleb\u0153uf it attains its greatest strength, but it extends far beyond, and is sometimes to be found above Rouen. \" The greater number of accidents that happen to vessels navigating the Seine may be attributed to this Bore ; for should a vessel from any cause take the ground, it frequently happens, especially during springs, that when the flood reaches her she is thrown on her broad side and buried in the sand set in motion by the strength of the stream, and as it is then impossible to send any assistance she becomes, in almost every case, a lost vessel. The number of masts sticking up in various parts of the river testify that these misfortunes are not unfrequent, and the greatest attention should therefore be paid by commanders of vessels ascending the river until they arrive at Quilleb\u0153uf, where they can be secured to the quay before their vessels are exposed to the danger of grounding in the channel. If they cannot arrive at this position before the end of the flood they must hasten to take shelter either at Honfleur or Havre, whilst there is yet sufficient water in the narrow channels. Generally speaking,"], [444, "422 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. they should not attempt to ascend or descend the river without a leading wind or in tow of a steam-vessel. \"Sailing vessels at Havre or Honfleur intending to ascend the Seine, should leave those ports directly they float, and, with a leading wind, they may expect to reach Quilleb\u0153uf before the ebb begins to be felt. This navigation, however, can only be undertaken with safety during springs, for, at neaps, the depth of water is not sufficient for vessels of much draught to navigate the lower part of the river. Most vessels waiting at Havre for springs to ascend the river, quit the harbour on the ebb preceding the flood which is to take them up to Quilleb\u0153uf, and anchor in the Petite Rade ; by doing so, they avoid the loss of time which the getting out of the harbour would occasion with westerly winds, and do not run the risk of losing a favourable tide.\" Caution. \u2014 To show the danger attending the Bore ; on the 8th February, 1871, H.M. gunboat Pheasant, while at anchor off Quille b\u0153uf, lost a bower anchor and 30 fathoms of chain. The vessel at the time was riding to the ebb, which was running at the rate of 4 or 5 knots, when the Bore, without any warning, came up the river in two waves of from 6 to 8 feet in height and travelling at the rate of 6 to 7 knots ; this caused the cable to part, but, steam being ready, the vessel was soon under control and no further damage was done. In the Seine, there is no interval at all of slack water between the ebb and flood tides, and, on the occasion referred to, the moment the Bore had passed, the flood was making up at the rate of 6 or 7 knots. After the flood tide, there is always some interval of slack water. The bore appears principally at springs, but varies greatly in size, and does not take place with any regularity ; it is therefore impossible to know beforehand whether there will be one or not.* Tides. \u2014 Under exceptional circumstances of tide, a vessel drawing 23 feet water can get up to Rouen, but, under ordinary circumstances, it is not safe to count on more than 17 or 18 feet water, between Havre and Rouen, at springs, and 14 feet at neaps.t Pilotage Regulations. \u2014 The following regulations for the pilotage of the lower Seine were issued by the Chef de la Marine at Havre, in February, 1887 : \u2014 \" 1. Every pilot of Quilleb\u0153uf who pilots a ship drawing 5 metres (16 feet ih inches) or more up the river, and who has not examined * Lieutenant H. W. Rochfort, H.M.S.

In this case the pilot fees are to be distributed between the two pilots. \" 3. The assistant pilots are taken on board of the ships referred to in Section 1 by the steamer Rouen, Captain Carre, stationed at Havre, which has to go every day, at the beginning of the flood tide, to meet ships bound for the Seine. \" 4. Besides taking the assistant pilots on board ships, the steamer is also bound to inform ships going up the Seine, by word of mouth, or, if this is not possible, by the following signals, of important facts connected with their course : \u2014 (a.) A blue flag, 5 feet square, with the letter R in white, means \" a clear channel.\" (b.) The same flag over a red streamer, signifies, \"decrease in tjie depth of water at the entrance to the mouth of the river.\" (c.) The same flag under a red streamer, signifies, \" considerable changes in the direction of the channel.\" \" 5. The taking on board of the pilots and assistant pilots by the steamer is to be by turns, according to rules to be laid down by the chief officer of the Seine pilots. \" 6. The chief officer of the Seine pilots has to take the necessary measures for ensuring that the channel is examined by the pilots, if possible, every day ; and, that pilots do not go to sea if they have not examined the channel the day before. \" Special measures will be taken to ensure the carrying out of these regulations.\" Bane de Seine. \u2014 The deposits of sand and mud washed down by the river Seine extend far beyond the shoals at the river's mouth and form an extensive submarine flat and slope, agreeing somewhat in shape with the curve of the bank bordering the shore from Port en-Bessin to the meridian of the Dives. This flat, on which the soundings increase slowly and regularly towards the offing, occupies the whole breadth of the mouth of the river, and may be said to terminate northward on about the parallel of cape de la Heve ; but, on the parallel of Havre, a narrow tongue of shoal water, named the Bane de Seine, extends 15^ miles westward of it ; it is steep-to on its southern side, slopes gradually to the northward, and is not dangerous, having from 7 to 9 fathoms water at its outer part, but the"], [446, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. Chap IX. 424 streams cross it obliquely and cause eddies upon its steep edge, where the sea is high during northerly gales on a weather tide. The Bane de Seine and the deep southward of it, called by the pilots the Parfond, are useful guides in establishing the position of a vessel during fogs or thick weather, when the navigation can only be carried on by means of the lead. From the western extreme of the bank, in 9 fathoms, cape de la Heve lighthouses bear E. by S. 4. S. 14 miles, and Ver lighthouse S.W. by W. \\ W. 13 miles. DANGERS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SEINE \u2014 Bane de Trouville.\u2014 This bank of muddy sand, the south westernmost of the shifting banks at the mouth of the Seine, is about 24; miles long in an E. by N. \\ N. direction from abreast of the entrance to Trouville, and from half a mile to one mile wide, with general depths of from 3 to 7 feet water. It is, however, very difficult to define its extent westward, the water deepening so very gradually in that direction that at 2\\ miles farther there are only 9 feet water. A portion of its surface on the inner edge of the bank, about three quarters of a mile long and one cable wide, either dries from one to 4 feet or is awash at low water, springs ; this part lies in a N.E. and S.W. direction, about 4 cables from the shore abreast of Hennequeville. The sea is exceedingly heavy on this bank, with the wind from W.S.W. round by West to N N.E. Buoys. \u2014 A Black and red buoy is moored westward of the Bane de Trouville in about 8 feet water, 14. miles N.W. westerly from Trouville pier-heads. A red buoy with a vane is moored a mile northward of the bank, between it and the outer extreme of the Ratelets.* Villerville Channel. \u2014 The Bane de Trouville is separated from the shore by the Villerville channel, a narrow passage which is entered on the parallel of Trouville church. It is possible to enter the Seine by this channel, see page 426, which in 1878 had depths of from 14 to 20 feet, clayey mud ; vessels may anchor in 14 feet abreast of the mouth of the Touques, during an unfavourable tide. The streams follow the direction of the channel, and, in calm weather, the flood, at springs, runs about 5\u00a3 hours and ends 15 or 20 minuses after high water at Havre ; its greatest rate is about 4 knots, near half flood ; the ebb is rather weaker. * The relative positions of the buoys marking the Trouville. Ratelets. and Ratier banks, will be better understood by referring to the Admiralty chart than by any written description."], [447, "Chap. IX.] 425 THE SEINE \u2014 DANGERS AT ENTRANCE. Bane du Ratier, abreast of Villerville and 14 miles from the shore, with the Ratelets, a prolongation of the bank westward, forms one of the most dangerous shoals at the mouth of the Seine. The bank is of an irregular shape, and its surface, which dries from one to 12 feet above the lowest tides, is covered with a large quantity of stones and rolled shingle ; but, its base isa mass of compact brown clay and consequently not subject to change. That part of the surface which uncovers, including the Ratelets, is 3\u00a3 miles long in a W. by N. and E. by S. direction and forms a shelter from the flood stream to the banks of shifting sand eastward of it. From the western extreme of the Ratelets, in 6 feet, cape de la Heve light houses bear N. by E. \\ E. 54. miles. The eastern limit of the red light at Deauville, see page 428, passes about two thirds of a mile westward of that part of the Ratelets bank which uncovers, in 7 or 8 feet water. The Bane du Ratier covers towards half flood, and the sea runs high over it with strong winds between West and North, but, with the latter wind, it shelters in some degree the channel southward of it. Buoys. \u2014 The southern side of the Ratelets and Ratier is marked by three buoys, viz. : \u2014 a red and black buoy 2 cables south-westward of the Ratelets bank and only 4 cables north-eastward of the red buoy moored northward of the Trouville bank ; a black and white buoy abreast of the outer elbow of the Ratier ; and, a black and red buoy close to the eastern end of the high drying part of the bank. On its northern side are, a large red buoy with staff and vane and a small red buoy near the eastern end. The large red buoy with staff and vane, called the N.W. Ratier buoy, lies with Fatouville lighthouse on with the pier-heads at Honfleur. Vessels going up the Seine northward of the Ratier bank, steer direct for this as a fairway buoy and leave it on the starboard hand. The other buoys described as marking the Ratier are very small, and cannot be seen until a vessel is nearly on them. (See note on preceding page.) Bane d' Amfard lies about 2 miles northward of the Ratier, and, like the latter, its base is a mass of browm clay and its surface is covered with large shingle ; it, also, shelters the bank of shifting sand eastward of it. This bank uncovers about 6 feet at low water,"], [448, "426 cape Barfleur to cape d'antifEr. [Chap. IX springs, but its surface is subject to great changes ; for, in 1855, it was found that the stones or pebbles which constituted its inferior part in 1834, were then buried under shingle 6 feet thick, proving that the shingle on it is not so stationary as on the Ratier. Small vessels may pass northward of this bank at low water, by keeping the church spire at Harfleur open a quarter of a point northward of the guard house on Neiges point. The passage between the Amfard and the shore eastward of Havre is one of the entrances to the main channel of the Seine. Buoy. \u2014 A buoy painted with red and black bands, surmounted by staff and vane, is moored at the western extreme of the Bane d' Amfard, close to a patch which dries 2 feet, and about S. \u00a3 W. 1\u00a3 miles from the lighthouse on the eastern side of the entrance to Havre. \u25a0 The position of the buoy is, however, liable to change in consequence of alterations in the form and depth of water on the bank. The description of the Eclat, Hauts de la Rade, and other shoals on the northern side of the estuary, chiefly concern the approaches to Havre, and will be included in their proper place in describing that port which is near the entrance on the right or northern bank of the estuary of the Seine, see page 440. We now return to the left or southern bank. LEFT BANK of the ESTUARY of the SEINE\u2014 From the entrance of the river Dives to the hill of Notre Dame de Grace, which commands the town and harbour of Honfleur, the left bank of the estuary of the Seine trends about 14 miles E. by N. A N., and the coast is bordered by high hills, terminating abruptly towards the sea in cliffs of brown clay and stone, and in large landslips, except in front of three valleys where the shore is low and sandy. The widest and most remarkable of these valleys is that through which the little river Touques finds its way into the sea. This valley is 2 miles wide at the sea shore, but narrows suddenly 400 yards inland ; it may be recognised from a great distance off-shore by the town of Trouville, which is built at the foot of a high steep hill on the eastern side of the entrance of the river ; its suburb, Deauville, being on the western side. Vessels of more than 9 feet draught should be cautious in ap proaching the coast when within 44 or 5 miles westward of the Touques, as the flat, with only from 3 to 10 feet water, there extends 1\\ miles from the shore and increases in width in going eastward, so"], [449, "Chap, ix.] 427 THE SEINE. \u2014 LEFT BANE. \u2014 TROUVILLE. that off the entrance of the Touques no more than 12 feet water is to be found in any direction at a distance of 3| miles. Eastward of the Touques, the coast is bordered by uneven rocks which dry at low water and terminate 3 miles E.N.E. from Trouville in Villerville point. This point extends three quarters of a mile in a N.W. by N. direction from Villerville village and the ledge off it is dangerous to vessels proceeding through the Villerville channel, see page 424, but is marked by a red buoy in 6 feet at its edge, 7 cables from the shore. If the buoy should be gone, this rocky point will be avoided when passing northward of it, by keeping Roque point opening and shutting in with Fonds cliff E. \u00a3 S. southerly. Roque point is a high greyish-white cliff, perpendicular towards the river side, and may be easily recognised, being the first point on the left bank of the Seine which is seen to open out from Fonds cliff when coming from the South-west. TROUVILLE.\u2014 Touques River.\u2014 The entrance to this river lies E. by N. \\ N. northerly 74_ miles from that of the Dives, and is between two piers extending seaward in a N. by W. direction. The West pier extends 625 yards from point Deauville on the western side of the river, and the sands dry at low water 4 cables beyond the pier-head. The East pier does not extend so far from point Cahotte on the eastern side, the pier-heads bearing from each other about E.S.E. and W.N.W. The sands of Deauville form the western side of the channel from the pier-head to the low water line, and it is marked by three red buoys ; but, from the East pier head, a low dyke of rough stone, intended to prevent the eastern sands from drifting into the channel, extends a considerable distance and is marked close to on its western side by three black buoys. The channel between the piers is 164 feet wide ; the deepest water, about 19 or 20 feet, at springs, being towards the West pier. Within the piers the harbour opens out, and, on the eastern side are the quays of Cahotte and of Trouville old harbour extending up to the bridge, with good grounding berths alongside for vessels up to 12 or 14 feet draught. On the western side, its entrance facing the quays of Cahotte point, is the wet dock or basin, 986 feet long, 263 feet wide, with 20 feet over the sill at high water, springs, and 154; feet at neaps. This basin is surrounded by extensive quays ; and, in it, vessels of 15 feet draught can lie afloat at all times and unload direct into railway trucks, the railway station being just at the head of the basin and rails laid along the quays."], [450, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. ix. 428 The port of Trouville has no dry dock, though a half tide dock is about to be constructed, nor can repairs of any importance be effected. It has a public and a private hospital, both available for seamen in case of need. From 3,000 to 5,000 tons of coal are usually in stock at this port, and steamers in the basin are readily supplied at about 22s. per ton. The chief import is coal, of which between 60,000 and 70,000 tons arrive annually ; the other imports are wood, cement, ice, &c. The exports are unimportant, In 1887, the trade of the port, exclusive of its large fishing industry, was represented by the entry of 161 vessels, of which two thirds were steamers, of an aggregate of 49,549 tons. Trouville, formerly a small fishing port and village, has since 1860 expanded into a place of considerable commercial importance as well as having become a fashionable watering place. In 1886, it had a population of 6,308, and its suburb Deauville, across the river, 2,228 inhabitants. The railway station is at Deauville, and the communication is through Lisieux with the Cherbourg and Paris line. Trouville has also steamers running daily between it and Havre, for both passengers and goods, the passage lasting about 45 minutes. The small town of Touques is on the river about 2 miles above Trouville, and, at springs, vessels of light draught can ascend as high as Quai-au-Coq, a small place 5^. miles in the interior, where there is sufficient water for them to remain afloat. A Life-Boat is stationed at Trouville. LIGHTS. \u2014 At Deauville, on the western side of the entrance of the Touques river, stands a square lighthouse, 59 feet high, painted in alternate red and white bands, from which at 64 feet above high water is exhibited a fixed red tidal light, visible in clear weather from a distance of 9 miles, between the bearings S. \u00a3 W. and E. by S. \\ S. This light is not shown unless there are at least 1\\ feet water in the entrance channel ; its eastern limit passes over the Trouville bank in 6 feet, and westward of the Ratelets banks in 7 or 8 feet, A fixed ivhite light is exhibited 39 feet from the East pier-end, and 548 yards N. by W. 4.

Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Trouville, at 9h. 20m. Springs rise 22 feet, neaps 18 feet, and the neap range is 124 feet. The lowest neaps rise 11 feet above the sands at the entrance in the channel ; springs, 16 to 17 feet. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual tide signals (see page 8) are shown from a mast at Cahotte point, near the inner end of the East pier. Directions. \u2014 Westerly winds are the most favourable for entering the river Touques ; sailing vessels should not enter until half an hour before high water, but, with a leading wind, they may continue to enter until half an hour after high water, as the ebb is easily stemmed. At the entrance of the channel, in all weathers, there is almost a certainty of procuring pilots, though a heavy sea runs here when it blows hard from the westward. With off-shore winds, small vessels may anchor in about 10 feet water and L| miles from the beach abreast of the plain of Villers, which is 3 miles south-westward of the river entrance ; here they may remain until the tide has risen sufficiently for them to enter : but, with the wind from N.W. they should anchor in the Villerville channel between the Trouville bank and the coast, with the ruins of the chateau de Lasse on with the houses on Cahotte point, bearing S. by W. 4. W. ; if the wind should then freshen and back to West or S.W., they will be able to run through the channel and take refuge at Honfleur. The Coast. \u2014 From the mouth of the Touques, the steep coast trends 3 miles E.N.E. as far as the small village of Villerville, which stands rather high ; it then bends more eastward for 4 miles to the hill of Notre Dame de Grace, one of the highest and the most conspicuous hill in the estuary of the Seine, which is 34 miles wide between this point and Hoc point on the northern shore. The only part of the coast from Trouville to Honfleur where the shore is low and accessible at high water is eastward of Villerville, and between it and Vasoui. HONFLEUR. \u2014 This port is at the entrance of a beautiful valley, open to the North-east, and just eastward of the hill of Notre Dame de Grace. It is sheltered by the land on all sides, and the wind never raises such a sea as to make it dangerous to enter, Being so"], [452, "430 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. near Havre, it neither has nor needs mnch plant for repairing vessels, and its building yards, from which, in 1866, 29 vessels of 9,000 tons in the aggregate were launched, are now comparatively deserted. The trade of the port steadily progresses notwithstanding, and in 1887, 1,304 vessels, of a total tonnage of 213,014 tons, entered. The exports are chiefly dairy and agricultural produce to the value annually of \u00a31,360,000. The imports are principally timber and coals, valued at \u00a3300,000. The steamers of the London and South Western, and of the London, Brighton, and South Coast railways run regularly between it and Southampton and Newhaven respectively. The railway station is on the eastern side of the harbour, and the line connects with the general system of the country at Lisieux. Honfleur has both a sailor's home and a hospital, and its population, in 1886, amounted to 9,726. An ample supply of coal at from 16s. to 20s. per ton can always be obtained, there being usually about 2,000 tons in stock. Steamers are coaled lying afloat at their ordinary berths alongside the quays in the basins. The port consists of an outer tidal harbour, and of four wet docks or Bassins-a-flot, viz : \u2014 the Bassin de l'Ouest, the Bassin du Centre, the Bassin de l'Est, and the Fourth basin, of later construction, and now (1888) lengthened 200 yards. Provision is made by means of sluices, a large Bassin de Chasses, and other reservoirs of water for scouring them, as well as the channel leading into the port ; there is also a small tidal harbour on the western side, which serves chiefly for steamboats and small craft employed in the daily transport of passengers and country produce to Havre. The Bassin de l'Ouest is 427 feet long by 256 feet wide, and its depth is 18 feet at high water, extraordinary springs, 17 feet at ordinary springs, and nearly 10 feet at neaps. The Bassin du Centre is 427 feet long by 296 feet wide, and its depth is 214; feet at extraordinary springs, 20\u00a3 feet at ordinary springs, and 13 feet at neaps. The Bassin de l'Est is 986 feet long by 236 feet wide, and its depth is 22\u00a3 feet at extra ordinary springs, 21\u00a3 feet at ordinary springs, and 144; feet at neaps. The fourth basin is 1181 feet long by 243 feet wide, and is 16 inches deeper than the Bassin de l'Est. Quay frontage and storage are very ample, and all modern appliances, steam cranes, &c, are available for the rapid loading or unloading of ships. The entrance of the port is between two piers, partly stone and partly timber, 230 feet apart, and it is open to N. by E. The West pier extends 370 yards from the shore ; and, from its head, the"], [453, "Chap. IX.] 431 HONFLEUR. northern end of the breakwater of the Bassin de Chasses, under construction, which forms the eastern side of the entrance, bears E. \\ N. about 300 feet. The East pier is prolonged by a rough stone submersible dyke 650 yards long, constructed in 1886, to direct the channel and periodical flushings in order to overcome the rapid silting up to which this port appears to become more and more liable ; the dyke is marked by branches of trees at frequent intervals. The shifting sands uncover 2 or 3 cables beyond the pier-heads. The direction of the channel being very subject to change, is marked by red and black buoys, their positions being shifted as occasion may require. The red buoys are on the western side of the channel and the black buoys on the eastern side, according to the buoyage regulations in force at French ports. Vessels at high water, springs, usually pass over the small banks which form at the entrance of the channel, but it is dangerous for vessels under any circumstances to enter without a pilot, the sand being so moveable, and the streams, which set obliquely across the channel, so rapid that a laden vessel grounding during a high tide would run great risk of being totally lost. The depths in the channel were formerly 23 feet at high water, equinoctial springs ; 21 feet at ordinary springs ; and, 11\\ feet at neaps. The old channel has, however, entirely disappeared, and the effect of the new dyke and sluicing arrangements is as yet not sufficiently developed for more to be said than that the depths are very un certain.* Tides and Tidal Signals. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port Honfleur, at 9h. 29m.; springs rise 23 feet ; neaps 18 feet, The usual tide signals, see page 8, are made from a mast on the East jetty near the Tidal lighthouse. Westerly winds of any duration serve to raise the water, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. During rainy weather and at the melting of the snow, the freshets of the Seine are abundant, and with strong westerly winds they contribute greatly to raise the water in the port, At high water, the tide remains slack only 15 or 20 minutes, but the change in height from half an hour before to half an hour after high water not being more than 3 or 4 inches, the gates of the basins can remain open for that time without inconvenience. * In 1887, consequent upon the silting up of the harbour, a steamer of only 16 feet draught had to wait four days in the outer tidal harbour for a sufficiently high tide to admit her into the docks. At that time, the large Bassin de Chasses, opened only in 1881, had itself silted up until there were only about 2 feet water in it at springs, \u2014 Vice Consul's report 1887,"], [454, "432 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER [Chap. IX. A Lise-Boat is stationed at this port. LIGHTS. \u2014 From a circular tower erected on the Hospital point jetty at the north-western extreme of the town, is exhibited, at 92 feet above high water, a fixed ivhite light visible in clear weather from a distance of 15 miles. From a white iron tower on the West pier, 39 feet from the pier head and 33 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed red light visible in clear weather at 6 miles. At the north-western extreme of the breakwater of the Bassin de Chasses, E. \\ N. about 300 feet from the West pier-head, is shown 'provisionally whilst this breakwater is building, a fixed green light visible 4 miles. Tide Light. \u2014 From a round brick tower on the eastern pier at the entrance to the tidal harbour, is shown a fixed ivhite light, varied by red and green flashes ; it is 39 feet above high water and visible 9 miles. This light is shown only when there are 6^ feet or more in the channel ; each red flash indicates 3j additional feet, and each green flash three quarters of a foot more. Thus, with the ivhite light showing, two red flashes followed by one green flash signifies that the depth in the channel is 13\u00a3 feet, With the white light showing, one red flash followed by three green flashes signifies a depth of 12 feet. Two small fixed ivhite lights are also shown from the interior sides of the jetty-heads of the port. Fog Signals. \u2014 During thick or foggy weather, a bell is sounded from the end of the Hospital jetty, and a fog-horn from the East jetty where the tide lights are shown. (See note, page 10.) FatOUVille Lighthouse stands on the high lands of Fatouville 3\u00a3 miles S.E. by E. 4 E. from Honfleur West pier-head, and exhibits at 420 feet above high water a white light varied every three minutes by a red flash ; the flash is preceded and followed by a short eclipse, which, however, is not total within a distance of 12 miles. The light is visible in clear weather from a distance of 22 miles. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Honfleur is accessible to vessels of moderately deep draught during springs ; those arriving at the mouth of the Seine, at neaps, must wait for water to enter the passages leading to Honfleur either under sail, with the wind from W.S.W. round by West to N.N.E., or at anchor in the Grande Rade off Havre if the wind be off the land ; if remaining only a day or two for sufficient water, they may anchor in Carosse roads in 5 or 6 fathoms, mud and sand, with cape de la Heve lighthouses in line N.E. \u00a3 N. ; and,"], [455, "Chap. IX.] 433 HONFLEUR. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. Fatouville lighthouse open half a point northward of Hospital point lighthouse at Honfleur. At this anchorage, the stream runs towards the Seine until 4 hours flood ; its greatest strength is at 3 hours before high water at Havre and does not exceed 4 knots. Vessels having only a few hours to wait for tide, should keep under sail westward of cape de la Heve lighthouses in line, and a little northward of the line of the Hospital point lighthouse at Honfleur on with Fatouville lighthouse bearing S.E. by E. \\ E. ; but, should the strength of the tide drift them towards the river, they must anchor before passing these limits. Passes de Honfleur. \u2014 Two narrrow passages lead to Honfleur. The North passage is between the Amfard and Ratier banks and is the main channel into the Seine. Pilots take sailing vessels through this channel with the wind between W.N.W. and N.N.E., but, with contrary winds, although there is room to work, large vessels are usually towed. Hospital point lighthouse on with Fatouville light house S.E. by E. \\ E. leads through the passage just northward of the N.W. Ratier buoy and up to a position where a sight of the pier heads at the entrance of the port may be obtained ; but, as a vessel must cross the banks of shifting sand which dry at low water and whose height is very variable, it is extremely imprudent and dangerous for a large vessel to attempt it without a pilot. Small coasters may do so at 'i\\ or 4 hours flood during springs, and half an hour before high water at neaps. The South passage is between the Ratier and Trouville banks ; its leading line is, the northern extreme of Fonds cliff, Honfleur, on with Roque point, remarkable for its grey tint and its perpendicu larly steep shore, E. by S. In running through, this mark must be kept on until abreast of Vasoui ; from thence to Honfleur, keep between 2 and 3 cables from the shore. At night, you may be certain that you are in this channel when Roque light is just open of Fonds cliff. This passage is generally taken by sailing vessels with the wind between S.S.E. and W.N.W. ; coasters may run through it at 2\\ hours, and larger vessels at 34^ hours flood ; but, with a leading wind, during springs, it should not be entered by large vessels until 4 hours flood, as, between Villerville and Honfleur, that stream runs with great rapidity in the direction of the passage. The flood stream, at springs, commences 5 hours before high water at Havre and runs 54 hours ; its greatest velocity is towards half flood and is sometimes 7 knots between Vasoui and Honfleur. Should a vessel arrive abreast of A. 2771. Wt. 17197. 2 E"], [456, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. 434 Vasoui much before high water, she should sheer a little in-shore where the tide has less strength, and anchor until nearly high water. With strong southerly winds, vessels should be on their guard against the heavy gusts which rush down the narrow valleys between Penne de Pic and Honfleur ; vessels have sometimes been dismasted by them. Small vessels, when bound to Honfleur from the South-west, may use the Villerville channel, between the Trouville bank and the coast ; but, in doing so, they must proceed with caution by the lead and haul off in time to give a good berth to the rocky ledge off Villerville ; having passed the red buoy at its outer extreme, they may proceed by the leading mark for the South channel. Entering Honfleur. \u2014 The most favourable winds for a sailing vessel to enter this port are those between W.S.W. and E.N.E. round by North. The channel is crossed obliquely by the flood and ebb streams, and their extreme velocity, at springs, is from 5 to 6 knots The flood stream runs 5^ hours and ends just at high water; it is during the 15 or 20 minutes interval of slack tide which then ensues that a pilot prefers to take in a vessel of deep draught, there being then but little difficulty in following the course of the channel. Plenty of sail should be carried in passing through the outer part of the channel, and an anchor should be always ready to let go in case a sudden shift of wind or the heave of the sea should force the vessel out of the channel. In the event of such an accident, a signal for a steam-tug should immediately be made, by hanging the colours under the bowsprit. If the entrance is missed, anchor at once and await the arrival of the tug ; or, failing her, with the commencement of the ebb, quit the river as speedily as possible. With a fresh southerly wind, it is necessary to guard against the sudden off-shore gusts before referred to ; they are frequently felt under the hill of Notre Dame de Grace and blow strongly down the valley at Honfleur. With a head wind or a calm, a steam-tug should always be obtained and when nearing the entrance channel the tow rope should be well shortened in, and great attention paid to follow exactly the wake of the tow-boat, for the smallest deviation in the steerage is here sufficient to run the vessel ashore. RIGHT BANK of the ESTUARY of the SEINE\u2014 The extensive chalky level forming the plain of Caux, of which the mean height is about 375 feet above high water, bounds the northern shore of the estuary of the Seine ; and, from cape de la Heve, its most"], [457, "Chap. IX.] 435 THE SEINE. \u2014 RIGHT BANK. \u2014 HAVRE. western point, as far as the meridian of Quilleb\u0153uf, the northern or right bank of the river presents, for a large portion of its extent, a face of perpendicular chalk cliffs intersected by deep valleys. About one mile eastward of cape de la Heve, however, commences a broad alluvial flat which, for a distance of 4 miles, fronts the high chalk formation. The town and port of Havre occupies the western portion of this flat, and the little town of Harfleur is at its eastern end, at the entrance to one of the deepest valleys. CAPE DE LA HEVE, formerly known by the name of Chef de Caux, is 2\\ miles N.N.W. of the entrance to Havre, and forms the western point of the chalky cliffs which terminate the plain of Caux. The cape is perpendicular about half way down from its summit, the foot of the cliff being covered with the debris of frequent slips and fallen masses. LIGHTS. \u2014 On the summit of cape de la Heve stand two light houses, each 66 feet high, from which are exhibited two fixed white electric lights of the first order ; the lights are 397 feet above high water and visible in clear weather 27 miles. The lighthouses are square white buildings bearing N.E. \u00a3 N. and S.W. \u00a3 S. distant 107 yards from each other ; the southern lighthouse stands 100 yards from the edge of the cliff. The intensity of the lights is doubled in thick fogs. The lead should be frequently used when approaching these lights from the westward, especially if the Ver light has not been sighted ; and, in coming from the north eastward it should be noted that the lights become masked by the heights of Bleville on a S.W. by S. bearing. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on cape de la Heve, it stands midway between the two lighthouses but westward of their line. Tide Signals. \u2014 A signal station is established about 2 cables S.S.E. from cape de la Heve lighthouses, from which is repeated, for the benefit of vessels in the offing or roads, the tide signals made at the tide station at the inner end of the North jetty at Havre. HAVRE. \u2014 The town, tidal harbour, and large Bassins-a-flot or wet docks of this important port occupy the western part of the low plain, before described. In 1887, the foreign trade entering the port was represented by 2,658 vessels measuring 2,163,005 tons, and the coasting trade by 2,977 vessels measuring 382,197 tons. Steamers 2E2"], [458, "436 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. of the largest size run to all parts of the world, and by means of the railway to Rouen and Paris, as well as by its extensive and constant steam river traffic, Havre has excellent means of communication with the interior of France. The principal imports are cotton, coals, coffee, hides, timber, dye woods, petroleum, tobacco, palm oil, wheat, wood, &c, &c. The principal exports are silks and ribbons, broadcloths, cotton goods, lace, gloves, shoes, millinery, wines, brandy, &c, &c. The population of the town in 1886 was 112,074. There is a town hospital available for seamen in case of accident or illness, a Sailor's Home, and also reading rooms for seamen. Coals are to be obtained in any quantity, the stock on hand being usually from 10,000 to 12,000 tons, and the price from 14s. to 16s. per ton. Vessels are coaled alongside the quays in the docks either from carts or barges or both. Many of the wet docks have water for the largest sized merchant vessels at all times. Every kind of supply is plentiful and good. Tidal Harbour. \u2014 The entrance to the tidal harbour, or Avant port, lies S.S.E. 24 miles from cape de la Heve and is open to the heavy sea which rolls in with strong westerly winds. The entrance is between two jetties, of which the longest is on the northern side and shelters the entrance from westerly winds ; the South jetty is short, and joins the dock walls on the eastern side. The harbour is accessible at high water to vessels drawing from 22 to 24 feet during five or six days at springs ; that is to say, a day or two before full and change, and three or four days after. It is bordered by wide and commodious quays on all sides. The North quay is used by passenger steamers for the Seine and neigh bouring ports. Steam-tugs lie alongside the Floride quay ; and, the rest of the tidal harbour is used by vessels waiting for spring tides to go up the Seine and by coasting craft, Dredging operations are constantly in progress both in the harbour and basins, and periodical flushings take place in order to preserve and deepen the entrance channel. The harbour does not dry out at low water, springs, there being always at least 3 feet in the channel. The bank outside the southern jetty is a continuation of the bank in Heure bay ; and, like it, is of shingle cemented together by mud, forming a hard bottom in which anchors take hold with great difficulty. The bottom of the entrance channel is of the same description, but, inside, the shingle is covered"], [459, "Chap. ix.] HAVRE. \u2014 BASINS AND DOCKS. 437 with a layer of mud which forms excellent beds for vessels to ground upon. Basins. \u2014 There are at Havre nine basins or wet docks with ample quay accommodation and storage, and which communicate with the tidal harbour and with each other by gates. The basins are named the Bassins du Roi, de la Barre, Vauban, de la Floride, de l'Eure, Bellot, du Commerce, de la Citadelle, and Bassin-dock. The Bassin de l'Eure is the largest, and into both it and the Bassin Bellot vessels of 28 feet draught can enter at all tides, the depth of water on the sill of the Bassin de l'Eure being 33 feet 9 inches at high water springs, and 29 feet 5 inches at neaps, that on the sill of the Bassin Bellot being about 9 inches less ; in both cases, this is a considerably greater depth than the approaches to the port give. The width of the entrance to the Bassin de l'Eure, which is the basin used by the large trans-atlantic steamers, is 100 feet. The entrances to the other basins are from 68 feet to 37j feet wide, the latter being the width of the entrance into the Vauban basin, where British colliers lie. Enormous additional works are projected which, if carried out in their entirety, will involve an expenditure of nearly \u00a33,000,000, and will throw the whole of the present docks into the rear of the vast new docks to be constructed along the present sea-front. The sills of the gates of the Bassins du Roi and de la Barre, are 34^ feet above the level of the lowest springs ; the western end of the Bassin de la Floride has been thrown open to the tidal harbour and now forms a convenient shelter for coasters and wind-bound vessels ; its eastern end is formed into a half-tide dock. The gates of the Bassins du Roi and de la Barre can remain open without in convenience until the water has fallen 2 feet below high water which, both at spring and neap tides, takes place about 14; hours after high water slack ; and, as these gates are opened by the pressure of the rising tide about as long before the commencement of slack water, it follows that the basins can communicate with the harbour during 34; or 4 hours of each tide. Dry Docks. \u2014 Havre has four dry docks completed and in use : \u2014 No. 1, is 423 feet long on the blocks, is 98 feet wide, and has 29 feet 3 inches over the sill at springs ; Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are respectively 146, 179, and 228 feet long, 35 feet 9 inches, 42 feet, and 52 feet wide, and 22 feet 9 inches, 24 feet, and 26 feet deep. Two additional graving docks are to be completed by 1889, one being 460 feet in length on the blocks or 492 feet over all ; the other, 377 feet over all. There are also a floating dock capable of lifting a ship of 800 tons,"], [460, "438 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX\" repairing slips, masting sheers, a gridiron, and every convenience for repairs of all sorts to hull or machinery. Life-BoatS. \u2014 Three life-boats are stationed at Havre or in its immediate vicinity. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots of Havre are numerous and skilful, and are paid according to the distance piloted. According to regulations, the greatest distance is to cape Barfleur, and the least is, outside the banks at the entrance of the harbour; there is great competition among them, however, and being provided with excellent boats, they frequently meet vessels as far westward as the Casquets. Those who pilot vessels out of harbour are bound to conduct them clear of the outlying banks ; if they consent to take them farther, they are paid 15 francs, or by special agreement. Steam-tugs are always in readiness, and the signal for their services being required is, an ensign suspended under the bowsprit. LIGHTS. \u2014 North jetty. \u2014 From a small round tower, 36 feet from the outer end of the northern jetty and 39 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed white light, visible in clear weather from a distance of 9 miles. South j etty. \u2014 A red occulting light, visible 12 miles, is shown at 27 feet above high water from the end of the southern pier ; the eclipses take place every 5 seconds. Grand Quai. \u2014 On the Grand quai within the harbour, a fixed green light, visible 8 miles, is shown from an iron support at 56 feet above high water. This light on with that on the South jetty leads between the Haut du Sud-Ouest and the Haut de Quarante and up to the harbour entrance. Fog Signal. \u2014 A fog trumpet is sounded in thick or foggy weather near the lighthouse on the North jetty ; it gives a blast of 8 seconds, duration, followed by an interval of from 45 to 50 seconds. It is sounded from 3 hours before until 4 hours after high water. Should the trumpet be out of order a bell is sounded instead. (See note, page 10.) Tides and Tide Signals.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Havre at 9h. 18m. Springs rise 22 feet, neaps 18 feet, neaps range 12^ feet. The ordinary tide signals, see page 8, are made from"], [461, "Chap, ix.] 439 HAVRE. \u2014 PILOTS. \u2014 LIGHTS. \u2014 TIDES. the signal-station at the inner end of the northern jetty, and repeated from a signal-station about 2 cables S.S.E. from cape de la Heve lighthouses. Strong and lasting westerly winds have sometimes raised the water to the level of the quay, but this rarely happens. The wind, how ever, has great influence on the height of the tide. The freshets of the Seine, during a rainy season or the melting of the snow, also contribute greatly to raise the water in the harbour, and it has been remarked that the highest tides have almost always occurred during the strongest freshets. Havre has the great advantage over most of the harbours on the French side of the channel, of a long period of slack tide at high water. The maximum duration of this high wrater slack has been observed to be lh. 15m., the minimum from 20 to 25 minutes, and the mean interval 57 minutes. This long period of slack water is very valuable to the traffic of the port, as it allows several vessels to enter or leave the docks on the same tide. During the months of May, June, and July, the duration of slack water is, with some exceptions, generally less than the mean ; the rest of the year it continues almost always an hour or more. At springs, the duration of the flood is 5h. 10m., and of the ebb 7h. 15m.

DANGERS Off HAVRE.\u2014 The approaches to Havre are obstructed by banks of stones and shingle which form a belt of dangers fronting the shore between Neiges point, If miles eastward of the entrance, and cape de la Heve. The highest parts of this belt are, the Bane de l'Bclat, Hauts de da Rade, and Haut de la Petite Rade. By the survey of 1855, there appeared to have been no perceptible alteration in these banks since 1834 ; the summit of the Eclat is, however, a little higher since then.* r Bane de l'Eclat is divided into two high ridges a quarter of a mile apart ; 7 feet is the least water on the northern ridge, but the highest part of the southern ridge is awash at low water and is one of the most dangerous spots in the neighbourhood of Havre. The surface of this shoal patch is covered with masses of flint and shingle ; from it, cape de la Heve lighthouses bear N.E. \u00a3 E. 1\u00a3 miles ; and, the North jetty lighthouse S.E. \\ E. 24. miles. In the depression between the two ridges of the Eclat bank, there are only 12 or 13 feet water. There is a passage into the Petite Rade * See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Entrance of the Seine, No. 2,680 ; scale, m = 2 inches."], [463, "Chap, ix.] DANGERS OFF HAVRE. \u2014 BUOYS. 441 at the south-western end of the bank with from 9 to 15 feet water, but it is too dangerous to be taken without a pilot. The HautS de la Rade commence about a quarter of a mile S. by E. from the shoalest spot on the Eclat, and, with the Grand Placard, the Haut du Sud-Ouest, and the Haut de Quarante, extend as far as Neiges point. The Hauts de la Rade consist of three ridges separated from each other by narrow channels with from 10 to 12 feet water, and, in-shore of and sheltered by these ridges, is the Petite Rade. The North-west ridge is about 6 cables long and a cable wide ; it has 6 feet water on its highest part, which bears S. by E. \\ E. 7 cables from the highest part of the Eclat. The south-western ridge lies half a mile south- westward of this dangerous spot ; it has only 6 feet on it, and 9 feet at its western edge with cape de la Heve lighthouses in line ; it is the outermost danger on the parallel of the entrance to Havre. Nearly midway between its edge and the Eclat, is a third rather extensive rocky flat with from 9 to 12 feet water. The Grand Placard is nearly half way between the western edge of the south-western ridge and the harbour entrance, and, half a mile E.S.E. from it, is the Haut du Sud-Ouest ; both these shoals have as little as 3 feet on them. Haut de la Petite Rade, a heap of stones and gravel with 5 feet watery is at the eastern end of the Petite Rade and bears N.W. by W. 4. W. 5 cables from the North jetty-head. The Haut de Quarante is the easternmost part of these dangers, and is on the eastern side of the entrance to Havre ; it has as little as 3 feet on its outer part, only 3 cables from a similar depth on the Haut du Sud-Ouest. The two banks are connected by a 6-feet ridge, which forms the outer bar to the entrance. Buoys. \u2014 The following buoys mark the shoals just described and the approaches to them ; and, consequently, indicate the positions of these dangers to all vessels bound to Havre and to those from the northward bound up the Seine. A stranger should under no circumstances pass within the line of buoys marking these shoals without a pilot : \u2014 A whistle buoy, painted black and red in vertical stripes, lies in 7 fathoms water, W. 4, N. 34 miles from cape de la Heve southern lighthouse. The whistle should be heard under favourable condi tions of wind and sea from a distance of 5 miles."], [464, "[Chap. IX. 442 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. No. 1 red bell buoy is moored just southward of a 10-feet patch off cape de la Heve ; from it, the Semaphore bears E. \u00a3 S. 6 cables. A red whistle buoy is moored W. by N. \u00a3 N. Z\\ cables from No. 1 buoy, and nearly one mile from cape de la Heve semaphore. No 2 black buoy, in about 64_ fathoms, is near the north-eastern edge of the Eclat bank, and 3 cables southward of the red whistle buoy. No. 3 black bell buoy shows also a white gas light ; it is moored in about 4^ fathoms, W. 4. S. 5^ cables from the shoalest part of the Eclat bank, and 8 cables S.W. by S. from No. 2 buoy. No. 4 buoy, black and red bands, lies in about 4^ fathoms S. \u00a3 W. 84. cables from No. 3 buoy. No. 5 buoy shows a white gas light and is painted red and black ; it lies in about 6 fathoms S. by W. westerly 84^ cables from No. 4 buoy ; and, from it, Havre North jetty lighthouse bears E. \u00a3 N. 2\\ miles. No. 6 black buoy is at the southern edge of the Grand Placard shoal, and bears S.E. by E. 1\\ miles from No. 4 buoy. Haut de Quarante buoy, in about 2 fathoms at the south-western edge of the shoal, is both a bell and light buoy ; the light is quick occulting ; the flash lasting three seconds, the eclipse one and a half seconds.* In addition to these buoys marking the outer part of the shoals are, No. 7 black buoy marking the western entrance to the Petite Rade, No. 8 red buoy its northern limit, and No. 9 buoy, red and black bands, close to the Haut de la Petite Rade, its south-eastern limit. PETITE RADE DE HAVRE is the anchorage inside the banks just described between Havre and cape de la Heve. It is well sheltered with the wind from N.E. round by East to S.E. but is open to all others, and strong breezes between North and W.S.W. send in a heavy sea. The holding ground is good, and anchors take such firm hold in the clay that there is sometimes great difficulty in weighing, especially when vessels have been riding to strong westerly winds. It should, however, only be used as a temporary anchorage where vessels may wait, with off-shore winds, for sufficient water to enter the harbour, but they should not remain there in unsettled weather, nor if it blows strongly from the westward. Vessels of moderate draught anchor in the middle of the Petite Rade in from 16 to 25 feet water ; the best of the anchorage is * The French Government gave notice on August 21st, 1888, that this light had been accidentally extinguished, and had been replaced by a fixed light. Probably this is only a temporary arrangement, and mariners should therefore be on their guard."], [465, "Chap, ix.] 443 RADES DE HAVRE. 5 or 6 cables long in a N.W. and S.E. direction and 2 cables wide ; from its centre, cape de la Heve lighthouses are in line ; and, Fatouville lighthouse, on the southern shore of the Seine, is about a quarter of a point open northward of the lighthouse on the North jetty. Small vessels are placed nearer the shore, with Fatouville light house open northward of the North jetty lighthouse; but, no nearer the shore than to have cape de la Heve southern lighthouse bearing North. The holding ground here is so good that, unless she parted, a small vessel with a good scope of cable would be in no danger during a westerly gale. Directions. \u2014 The only practicable entrance to the Petite Rade de Havre for vessels of moderate draught at low water, is between the cliffs of cape de la Heve and the northern ridge of the Eclat, but a stranger should not use it without a pilot. The least depth midway between the northern ridge and the shore is 13 feet. To enter this channel, steer for the southern lighthouse on the cape on a S.E. \\ E. bearing ; this leads northward of the whistle buoy just outside the Eclat bank, and 3 cables northward of No. 1 buoy ; when about 3 cables from the cliffs, the vessel is in mid-channel and must then bear away southward for No. 8 red buoy, moored between the northern ridge of the Eclat and the shore, taking care not to approach so near the land as to entirely lose sight of the lantern of the northern lighthouse. Small vessels, locally acquainted, run for the anchorage in the Petite Rade at low water, passing either northward or southward of the southern ridge of the Eclat ; the lead and chart are the only guides for these channels. GRANDE RADE de HAVRE, is simply an anchorage in the open sea N.W. by W. 5 miles from cape de la Heve. Vessels of deep draught having to wait for springs to enter Havre, sometimes anchor here in quite fine weather or with off-shore winds, but they should be prepared to weigh instantly on any change in the weather. The holding ground is excellent, and, from a vessel in the centre of the anchorage in 9 fathoms water, cape de la Heve bears S.E. by E. ; Fatouville lighthouse on with the North jetty lighthouse at Havre S.E. easterly ; and, the outer whistle buoy S. \\ E. easterly about 2h miles. When bound into Havre from the Grande Rade, with the wind from E.N.E. round by East to S.W., weigh as soon as the flood has acquired strength, so as to be near the Hauts de la Rade before the stream changes its direction north-eastward. When near these"], [466, "444 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. banks, the directions for entering the harbour presently given must be attended to. With a fair wind, weigh so as to be at the harbour's mouth at the proper time for entering. Tidal Streams.\u2014 Grande and Petite Rade.\u2014 The flood stream begins in the Petite Rade about 14; hours after the tide has begun to rise in the harbour, or about 4 hours before high water there. Its first direction is S. by E. for 2 hours, with a velocity of from 2g to 3 knots ; it then turns to E.S.E. and the stream becomes imperceptible until high water in the harbour, when it again acquires strength, runs N.N.W., and ends in that direction 14; hours after. The ebb commences immediately and runs N.N.W. for 3 hours or until 4Jr hours after high water in the harbour ; it then turns to W.S.W. and ends in a S.W. direction a few minutes before the flood commences. At the northern entrance into the road, the streams follow the same course, but the flood does not end until 2 hours after high water. The ebb runs N.N.W. during 24; or 3 hours, and then turns W.S.W. and S.S.W. When the tide is out in the harbour, the ebb runs S.S.W. from 14^ to 2 knots, and it ends in this direction a little before the flood stream commences at this spot, or about 4 hours before high water in the harbour. Vessels running into this road at low water should be aware of this stream of tide when passing the shoal patches. The flood stream begins to be felt in the Grande Rade about 4 hours before high water at Havre. An hour after, it runs S. by W. at the rate of about 3 knots, and continues to run towards the Seine until 24 hours before high water ; its direction is then E.S.E., losing little of its strength, and then E.N.E. In the latter direction, its rate increases to 2\\ or 3 knots at the time of high water in the harbour ; it then decreases in strength and ends about 2 hours after, running N.E. by N. The ebb commences almost as soon as the flood ends, slack water lasting only about a quarter of an hour at springs. This stream turns round by West, and about 3 hours after high water its direction is N.W., but it does not attain its greatest strength of 2\\ knots until it runs W:S.W., or about 5 hours after high water ; it then slackens gradually as it turns to the southward, where it ends. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Entering Havre.\u2014 Although steam navi gation is largely in the ascendant at this port, and even for sailing vessels the services of steam-tugs are always available, yet to those who prefer to enter independently of these aids the following"], [467, "Chap. IX.] HAVRE. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 445 directions will be useful, observing that no stranger should attempt it without a pilot. Vessels arriving off the port some hours before the tide serves, should remain outside the banks off the entrance until the tide has risen sufficiently to pass over them. The stream runs into the Seine from the commencement of the flood until 2 hours before high water ; but, there is no fear of being drawn into the river if vessels keep westward of the line of cape de la Heve lighthouses in one bearing N.E. \u00a3 N., or if cape d'Antifer is kept a few degrees open westward of cape de la Heve ; taking care at the same time not to go southward of the line of the Chateau d'Orcher, which stands near the shore about 2 miles eastward of Harfleur, on with the projecting angle of the wall enclosing the Floride basin bearing E. \\ S. With a fresh breeze from W.N.W. round by North to E.S.E., there is no difficulty in turning to windward and keeping a position ; but, with all other winds, keep as near as possible to the line of the chateau and the Floride wall in one, because at about 2 hours before high water in the harbour, when the Seine is nearly filled, the flood stream turns to E.S.E., losing part of its strength, and then to N.E. In the latter direction, it runs with the same velocity as when it ran up the Seine, and retains it until nearly 24; hours after high water ; should a sailing vessel, at that time, be so far northward as the parallel of cape de la Heve, it would be almost impossible for her to reach the harbour in time to get in. With strong winds from N.N.W. round by West to W.S.W., it is necessary to keep under sail 6 or 8 miles to windward of the harbour until there is sufficient water to enter ; but, with moderate winds from S.W. round by South to E.N.E., during calm weather, or at the times of the freshets of the Seine, it is better to anchor in Carosse road, see page 432, or, between that road and the line of the Chateau d'Orcher on with the projecting angle of La Floride wall E. 4 S. Vessels can always get into harbour from the anchorage in the Petite Rade even during calms or head winds. When vessels of deep draught have failed in entering, and the direction of the wind and late hour of the tide do not permit a second attempt, they should at once run out of the Seine ; but, small vessels may take shelter under Hoc point, see page 451, whilst the tide is high. The flood stream entering the Seine, crosses the direction of the entrance channel into Havre at right angles, and renders access to the harbour for a sailing vessel difficult under certain circumstances, which should be understood."], [468, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. 446 The North jetty projects into the strength of the flood stream and occasions an eddy, the strength and extent of which depend on the velocity of that stream and on the range of the tide. About 3 hours before high water, when the stream begins to acquire its greatest strength, which is 4 or 5 knots at springs, the eddy extends as far as Heure bay, and forms along the shores of that bay and along the walls of La Floride, a rapid counter stream, of which one portion turns round the end of the South jetty and enters the harbour, whilst the other runs sharply against the North jetty, along which it forms a disturbed eddy. This action of the streams continues until about 14; hours before high water in the harbour ; but, at this time, the Seine, being nearly full, can no longer receive all the water running towards it from all points of the estuary, the stream here accordingly slackens, whilst towards the left bank, where the flood follows nearly the same direc as if the Seine did not exist or was barred off, the stream, not finding any issue upwards, crosses the Seine obliquely north-eastward ; this direction, however, soon changes and becomes more northerly as the river fills. When this cross stream has reached Hoc point, a portion runs along shore westAvard and produces the stream named the Verhaule, which, at the entrance of Havre, takes the same direction as the eddy on the flood, just described, and immediately follows it, but in much greater volume, the Verhaule passing round the North jetty and running to the North-west, The effect of these different eddy streams on the flood tide, is to raise a high and confused sea at the entrance of the harbour when it blows strongly from the westward. The Verhaule, of which a part enters and helps to fill the harbour, is in fact the last part of the flood ; but, it runs in an opposite direction to the stream during the first hours of the rising tide and helps to keep vessels in the entrance channel, thus facilitating their entrance with westerly winds. Its greatest strength is about three quarters of an hour before high water and it continues to run until the harbour is filled, when it decreases gradually and is hardly perceptible at the end of slack water. The ebb then commences and at first is feeble, but, in an hour's time, it gains strength and runs towards the North and N.N.W. in the same direction as the Verhaule when near its end. The deviation of the flood stream, occasioned by each of the pro jecting angles of the quays bordering the entrance, is another difficulty in entering Havre with a scant wind, especially if a vessel has entered before the basins and harbour are filled."], [469, "Chap, ix.] 447 HAVRE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. It appears, therefore, that for vessels intending to remain in the outer harbour, the best time to enter is at high water slack, but this is rather too late for those entering the basins. They, on the contrary, should enter as soon as the tides serves, so as to have time to secure before the beginning of the ebb. The anchors should be ready for letting go before entering, and one should be placed conveniently for anchoring by the stern ; warps and hawsers also should be coiled clear for use on deck and ready to run out in case of need. The best time of tide for a sailing vessel to enter, must however depend greatly on the direction of the wind. With a fresh westerly wind, she may run in even whilst the counter stream along the walls of La Floride is at its greatest strength, care being taken to keep in mid-channel so as not to drift on the North jetty. With fresh winds between W.S.W. and N.N.W., the Verhaule causes a violent sea, and it is then best not to enter until the end of slack water, when the sea is rather less confused and the tide slack in the entrance channel. With the wind sufficiently strong between S.S.W. and E.S.E. to stem the tide, she may enter before the Verhaule commences. Should the wind, however, be between E.S.E. and N.E., it is advisable to secure the services of a steam-tug, the arrangements for tracking vessels formerly in vogue having been entirely superseded by towing. Boats are always ready at the entrance and in the harbour to run out warps for hauling the vessel into her berth as may be necessary. To Havre from the \"Westward. \u2014 Generally speaking, in a sailing vessel, the direction of the wind met with in the entrance of the Channel should determine the choice of the landfall to be made in order to take a fresh departure for Havre, see also Directions page 370. With the wind from E.N.E. round by North to W.S.W., the English coast should be made between the Lizard and Portland Bill, but not eastward of the Bill for, should the wind then back more to the southward, it would be impossible for a sailing vessel to fetch Havre with the flood stream running. As soon as the position of the vessel is ascertained, a course should be shaped to sight cape Barfleur lighthouse. Steamers from the southward endeavour to sight Ushant, and sailing vessels, in clear weather, with the wind between W.S.W. and S.S.E. may do the same. The points of the French coast which should then be sought for in succession are, Ushant ; the high land between Ushant and ile de Bas ; Guernsey, a sight of which assists in making or clearing the Casquets ; and lastly,"], [470, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. 448 Alderney, and the high land at the back of cape de la Hague. If this passage is adopted, however, great attention must be paid to the tidal streams when running between the ile de Bas and Guernsey as the ship's course crosses their direction nearly at right angles. During the ebb there is no danger, as that stream runs towards the N.N.W., but the flood sets strongly into the gulf of St. Malo and is very rapid at springs. At 10 miles from the coast between Ushant and ile de Bas, the flood stream ends about 24^ hours after high water by the shore. As Guernsey and the Casquets are approached, the greatest care must be taken to keep well clear of them, the rate of the flood stream between them being from 4 to 5 knots, at springs ; a vessel should therefore always pass well westward and only just within sight of the Casquets. When north-westward of the Casquets, follow the directions given at page 370 until eastward of cape de la Hague to avoid the race of Alderney and the strong tides in that neighbour hood ; and, from thence, the course is about E.S.E. to make cape Barfleur lighthouse, taking care to keep from 3 to 6 miles from the coast in order to avoid the numerous dangers which border it. By whatever route a vessel has come, when cape Barfleur light house or the high land at Pernelle is made out, a course should be shaped to make the land between cape de la Heve and cape d'Antifer, or direct for the former cape, according as the wind inclines from the northward or southward. After passing cape Barfleur and having entered the bay of the Seine, the first land seen when steering as described will be that which bounds the estuary of the Seine on either side. The high land of the plain of Caux should be ahead and on the port bow, terminating towards the coast in chalk cliffs of dazzling whiteness, which, when lighted up by the sun, are plainly distinguished from 18 to 20 miles off ; and, on the starboard hand to the southward, will be the hills bordering the left bank of the Seine from Honfleur to the river Dives ; their rounded shape, and especially their dark colour, distinguish them from those to the northward. When the meridian of cape Barfleur is crossed towards the com mencement of the flood, that is, about 5| or 6 hours before hio-h water at Havre, see table, page 383, a vessel with a leading wind may arrive off Havre in time to save the tide. On passing the meridian of Barfleur at the commencement of the ebb, or about one hour after high water at Havre, a course should be shaped for cape d'Antifer and only sufficient sail carried to stem the tide, which, in the middle"], [471, "Chap. IX.] 449 HAVRE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. of the bay, runs 34; or 4 knots, at springs, about 44^ hours after high water at Havre. Should the position of Havre be made out before the commencement of the flood, sail must be so regulated as not to arrive off the harbour's mouth until there is sufficient water to enter. At night, with the wind between North and West, a course should be shaped from cape Barfleur to make the land between cape de la Heve and cape d'Antifer. Cape de la Heve and Fecamp lights are good guides to the vessel's position ; to prevent her approaching too near the land, it should be borne in mind that Fecamp light is concealed by the high land at Etretat on an E. \u00a3 N. bearing, and, cape de la Heve lights, by the hillocks at Bleville on a S.W. by S. bearing ; therefore, if Fecamp light is shut in whilst those on cape de la Heve are visible, the land will be made southward of cape d'Antifer ; and, if the lights on cape de la Heve should be shut in whilst the light at Fecamp is visible, it is necessary at once to haul out to open cape de la Heve lights again and to get to the southward, the vessel being evidently several miles northward of her position. Fecamp light will not be lost sight of at the distance of 6 or 7 cables off cape d'Antifer, nor cape de la Heve lights at the same distance off the coast between cape d'Antifer and Cauville. Thus, should it be desired to maintain a position during the night by turning to wind ward between cape d'Antifer and Cauville, go about, when standing in for the land, the instant the lights on the cape disappear, and in standing off-shore during the flood, tack when Fecamp light reappears ; but, during the ebb, the off-shore board may be continued farther without inconvenience. With a moderate breeze and smooth water, a vessel may anchor on the line of Fecamp light eclipsed by the land, provided she is some miles southward of the parallel of cape d'Antifer. The holding ground is excellent as far as 5 miles off-shore between that cape and the Grande rade, but nearer the coast, between Bleville guard-house and Cauville, the bottom is covered with heaps of large stones for 1\\ miles off-shore. It may be proper here to remark that between capes de la Heve and d'Antifer, at 4 or 5 miles from the shore, the flood stream, at springs, runs at the rate of 2 or 3 knots to the N.E. for 4 hours, i.e., from 2 hours before to 2 hours after high water at Havre ; it then slackens and turns more northward, so that a vessel caught by a contrary wind when southward of cape d'Antifer, would be unable during that period to reach Havre by turning to windward close A. 2771.

During the freshets of the Seine, vessels intending to enter Havre must avoid being set northward of the parallel of cape de la Heve. When rounding cape Barfleur with a south-westerly wind, from a position about 6 miles northward of that cape, haul up S.E. by S. or S.E. to sight the Ver light ; and, when on its meridian, keep away two or three points to sight cape de la Heve lights and steer for the anchorage in the Grande rade ; or, with a pilot on board, Havre may be steered for if the tide serves, and sail so regulated as not to arrive off the harbour's mouth until there is sufficient water to enter, see directions page 444. With a head wind, long boards should be made across the bay of the Seine by day as well as by night, recollecting that the flood stream ends in the bav nearly 2h hours before high water at Havre. To Havre from the Eastward. \u2014 In clear weather, with the wind between North and East, the Pas de Calais channel, between the Ridge bank or Colbart and the French coast, may be taken, and from thence a SW. \u00a3 W. course leads between the Bassurelle and Vergoyer banks direct for cape d'Antifer ; Fecamp light will be seen in following this course, and is a good guide at night. This channel is also used in fine weather when the wind is between South and East, keeping 4 or 5 miles from cape Grisnez, and passing outside the Bassure de Baas bank. When southward of the river Somme, and westward of the meridian of Dieppe, the coast may be neared if necessary ; but, should the wind veer to S.W., a vessel should quit the French coast immediately and, if it increases to a gale, seek the sheltered anchorage in Dungeness East Road. With the wind from N.N.W. round by West to W.S.W., the Dover channel between the Varne and the English coast should be used. From Beachy head, cape de la Heve bears S.S.W. 73 miles, and the passage with westerly winds is made more advantageously on the ebb than on the flood ; vessels, therefore, having held their own to wind ward, and in sight of Beachy head lighthouse, to the end of the flood, should then stretch across so as to arrive abreast of cape d'Antifer at the beginning of the following flood and in time to enter Havre at high water. Fecamp light is an excellent guide for the landfall on the French coast, and, in clear weather, will be seen in a 20-miles run after Beachy head light has been lost sight of. Heure Bay. \u2014 Between Havre and Hoc point, the shore and adjacent land is low but defended against the sea by an artificial"], [473, "Chap. IX.] HAVRE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 HARFLEUR. 451 embankment abutting the wall which encloses the southern part of Havre as far as the middle of Heure bay, and, from thence to Hoc point, by a high natural bank of shingle. Heure bay seems to have been hollowed out by the violent eddy during the flood previously described, and is filled with shingle cemented together with mud, which uncovers from 9 to 13 feet at low water. In bad weather, whatever the direction of the wind, the sea breaks directly on the shore during the flood, and any vessel then missing the entrance to Havre and driving on shore in this bay would to a certainty be totally wrecked. Hoc Point. \u2014 This low point, composed of a mass of rolled shingle, is 34^ miles eastward of Havre, and 14 miles S.S.W. of Harfleur. It may be recognized by two large houses built to serve as a lazaretto, by the lighthouse, and by a guard-house about 200 yards from the lighthouse. The point projects considerably from the shore and occasions a strong eddy during the flood. This eddy stirs up the sand and hollows out a deep, the extent and depth of which are variable ; but, small vessels bound for Harfleur, or intending to ascend the Seine, lie aground without danger, sheltered by the point, and await spring tides. The bottom in this deep is sand and shingle, and vessels are moored securely as near as possible to either of its sides. The eddy on the flood is troublesome and the ebb stream very rapid. A good anchorage to await tide may be found a cable from the shore south-westward of Hoc point, with Harfleur steeple seen between the two warehouses of the lazaretto, but it is not safe for vessels to go there before 3 hours flood, nor to remain there after 3 hours ebb. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light, dioptric and of the fifth order, is exhibited at 39 feet above high water from the circular lighthouse on Hoc point, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 10 miles. HARFLEUR. \u2014 This little port dries out every tide, and small vessels ground on the slopes of mud forming the steep banks of the little river Lizarde which empties itself into the Seine about a mile below Harfleur at the head of the bay, which is 24. miles wide between Hoc point and the hill at Orcher. The lower course of the river was cleared out in 1838, and its waters formed a channel through the sands as far out as Hoc point, but, in 1869, this channel was completely choked up, and what little trade the port formerly had, has been almost entirely transferred to Havre and Fecamp. 2F2"], [474, "452 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. IX. The Coast. \u2014 From cape de la Heve, the coast trends N.E. \\ N. northerly for 11 miles to cape d'Antifer, and consists of chalk cliffs with strata of flint from 320 to 370 feet high, which, with on-shore winds, have no accessible spot. Half a mile northward of cape de la Heve is the shore end of the telegraph cable communicating through Ballin skellig bay, Ireland, with America. Between cape de la Heve and the little valley of St Jouin, 84; miles farther northward, the crown of the cliffs only is perpendicular, enormous masses of flints shattered down from the cliffs above being banked up against them. It is supposed that the action of the sea causes a constant movement of these masses southward along the coast, and that they have largely contributed to form the banks south-westward of cape de la Heve, which obstruct the approaches to Havre and the Seine. Northward of St. Jouin, the cliffs, including cape d'Antifer, are quite perpendicular, the sea washing their base, and in the afternoon when lighted up by the sun their brightness is so dazzling that they may be seen 21 miles distant. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on cape d'Antifer. Tidal Streams in the Bay of the Seine,\u2014 The tidal wave of flood, after having traversed the western portion of the Channel, is much contracted as it advances eastward between Cherbourg and the Isle of Wight, and, in consequence of this compression, its velocity is greatly increased, especially towards the French coast. As soon as it has passed the meridian of cape Barfleur, its southern portion turns rapidly in every direction between South and East, to fill up the space occupied by the bay of the Seine ; whilst the northern portion, or that part northward of a line drawn from cape Barfleur to cape d'Antifer, follows its original direction almost as far as the meridian of the river Orne, where it begins to curve to East and E. by N. A considerable portion of the water which enters the bay, after rounding cape Barfleur with great rapidity, forms a stream which takes a S.E. by S. direction towards the mouth of the Seine. The southern part of this stream runs along the shore of the bay, and follows its sinuosities from point Percee to the mouth of the Orne, and then turns towards the Seine ; the northern part turns obliquely towards the coast between Havre and cape d'Antifer, and then bends back to S.S.W. and S.S.E. towards the Seine. Thus, the mouth of the Seine being the point towards which all these streams are directed, the river becomes full at two thirds flood, and the water within having attained the level of that without, the streams lose their strength and are forced eastward, and run towards E.N.E. and N.E. ;"], [475, "Chap, ix.] 453 BAIE DE LA SEINE. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. in fact, in the direction they would have naturally followed from the commencement of the tide if the Seine had not existed. The ebb stream in the interior of the bay, when at its greatest strength, runs in the opposite direction to the flood ; but, northward of the line drawn from cape Barfleur to cape d'Antifer, its direction is W. by N. The windings of the coast modify the direction of both streams near the shore, and, behind each projecting point, there is an eddy depending on the strength of the tide for its extent, During springs, the flood stream is more rapid than the ebb. It commences suddenly and is not long in gaining strength ; the ebb, on the contrary, is slower in establishing itself. When stream and wind are in the same direction, the rate and duration of the stream is increased in proportion to the strength of the wind ; but, when the wind blows from a direction opposed to the stream, it has little effect on it."], [476, "CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER.

Fecamp - - - - 17\u00b0 0' W. Entrance of River Somme 16\u00b0 50' W. ASPECT Of COAST.\u2014 Cape Grisnez bears from cape d'Antifer N.E. \\ E. easterly 89 miles, the coast between forming a bight to the South-east, 106 miles in circuit and receding 24 miles from a line connecting the two points. The high cliffs of chalk and flint, described in the preceding chapter, extend from cape de la Heve to within about 4 miles north-eastward of Treport, near the town of Ault, and beyond them commences a low coast fronted by a sandy beach on which three wide valleys open out and give issue to the waters of the rivers Somme, Authie, and Canche. This low coast extends to within about 4 miles of Boulogne ; the land then rises abruptly and the shore con tinues steep, with a few exceptions, as far as cape Grisnez. All the harbours between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez dry at spring tides, and are inaccessible to vessels of deep draught at neaps.* The cliffs between cape d'Antifer and Ault are precipitous, their foot resting upon a narrow shelf of rock covered at all times of tide. A telegraph cable connecting with Beachy head leaves the shore just northward of the cape. The ports of Fecamp, St. Valery-en-Caux, Dieppe, and Treport, at about equal distances from each other, are at the entrances of wide valleys forming breaks in the line of cliffs. The land crowning the cliffs is for the most part level in its whole extent, but the monotonous aspect of the coast is varied by towns and villages near the sea, and by the verdure of the sides and bottoms of the valleys, which contrasts strongly with the uniform white of the cliffs. As the openings of all the valleys are dissimilar in some points, it is easy to distinguish them from each other, even from a considerable distance in the offing. * See Admiralty Charts : \u2014 North coast of France, sheet XII., Trouville to Dieppe.

No. l,St)j ; scale, m = U'68 of an inch."], [478, "[Chap. X. 456 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. The cliffs remarkable for their height are, that of Fagnet point, the northern point of entrance to the valley of Fecamp, on which stands a chapel dedicated to Notre Dame du Salut and Fecamp lighthouse ; the cliff of Catellier, with a small mound on its summit, which forms the western side of the Pallud, a wide valley watered by the Durdent river ; the cliff of St. Leger, three quarters of a mile westward of St. Valery-en-Caux, marked by a church tower, the only remaining part of the church ; the cliff of Sotteville, rendered remarkable by a large guard-house and a heavy-looking church tower overtopping a row of trees ; and, the cliff at Criel, 3| miles south-westward of Treport, which is the highest of all and is surmounted by Mont Joli-Bois, a large hillock covered with heath. When sailing close to the coast with off-shore winds, vessels must be on their guard against the squalls which rush down the valleys ; the most violent are felt abreast of the openings which do not reach down to the beach. The entrances of the rivers Somme, Authie, and Canche, are in the low land which extends over a space of 35 miles, from half a mile north-eastward of Ault to the foot of the hills of which the most western parts form cape Alprech ; they are all obstructed by banks of shifting sand which extend far outside their openings and dry at low water, springs. The small harbours of Vimereux and Amble teuse having been destroyed by the sea and abandoned as such, no longer admit vessels of any description. Approaching the Coast. \u2014 The shore between cape d'Antifer and point d'Ailly, about 5 miles westward of Dieppe, is without danger, and large vessels may coast it at the distance of 14 miles ; but, eastward of this point, the approach to the shore is dangerous for vessels of deep draught, for, from the meridian of point d'Ailly to that of Treport, are banks of sand and shells, usually called Ridins, some of them lying as much as 11 miles from the shore; and, eastward and northward of these, is the shoal bottom forming the base of the shifting sands obstructing the mouths of the Somme, Authie, and Canche rivers, which extends even northward of the latter. Outside these shoals, and towards the middle of the Channel, are several long submarine banks of sand, converging in direction towards cape Grisnez. These banks lie generally about E.N.E. and W.S.W., nearly in the direction of the tidal streams ; but, the Riding or ridges, point N.N.W. and S.S.E. in a direction perpendicular to the banks and consequently across the streams. There are spots with only 2 or 3 fathoms on several of the banks, which are therefore very dangerous for large vessels at all times, while some are so only at low water."], [479, "Chap. X.] THE COAST \u2014 CAUTION. \u2014 CAPE D'ANTIFER. 457 At full and change, the tidal streams form strong eddies at the steep edges of these banks, and in bad weather, or with a fresh breeze on a weather tide, small vessels crossing the eddies subject themselves to a heavy sea. The greater part of the Ridins need be avoided only on account of the eddies they occasion, but shoal spots have been found on some, which at low water in bad weather would be dangerous to vessels of deep draught. CAUTION.\u2014 During strong winds from W.S.W. round by West to N.N.W. the coast eastward of point d'Ailly is dangerous to be near, and shipwrecks are of frequent occurrence ; vessels therefore of every description at such times should keep a good offing, and when obliged to approach the coast, must do so with great caution ; for, although the general mass of the bank described appears to be stationary, great attention should be paid to the lead and to observing the confused state of the sea in the various eddies, so as to guard against meeting suddenly with dangers which may be of recent formation. The lights indicating the positions of headlands and dangers between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez, are so disposed that at night, in clear weather, two can always be seen at a time, and most of the harbours show tide lights whilst there is sufficient water for them to be entered. It is important to notice that along the coast between cape de la Heve and the town of Ault, a space of 67 miles, the wind, when it blows in a direction perpendicular or nearly so to the direction of the coast, does not blow home but is reflected by the cliffs, and its effect is to a certain extent neutralized for some distance towards the offing. Thus, except in front of the wide valleys where the direct wind meets with no obstacle, a zone is formed off and parallel with the coast, where the wind is light but the sea much agitated and the waves run towards the shore. On the other hand, when the wind forms an acute angle with the coast, the reflected wind tends to increase the force of the direct wind near the shore. CAPE D'ANTIFER, as already noticed, differs but little from the adjacent land, and is only remarkable from the red house and white mast of the Semaphore station about 30 yards from the edge of the cliff, and from the change in the direction of the coast which there takes place. The cape is rounded and terminates in a perpen dicular chalk cliff 320 feet high, of which the foot is washed by the sea ; in clear weather it may be seen 21 miles distant. Vessels of any draught may approach to within 2 or 3 cables of it without danger even at low water ; from thence, the coa6t trends about E. by N. 9 miles to Fecamp and may be approached to about 4 cables."], [480, "[Chap. X. 458 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. ETRET AT, a large fishing village and fashionable watering place, with a standing population of about 2,000, is on the shore at the entrance of a wide valley open to the North-west ; the houses are built on low land defended from the incursions of the sea by a natural high shingle beach, up which the fishermen heave their boats out of reach of the surf by means of capstans ; the beach is backed in the neighbourhood of the casino by pavement in masonry. Semaphore. \u2014 On the North-eastern cliffs of the little bay of Etretat is a semaphore station. The cliffs both eastward and westward of Etretat are very remarkable. They form sharp projecting points with openings in them resembling arches and doorways. Half a cable south-westward of the point, and westward of the village, is the Aiguille d'Etretat, a high rock, or rather the remains of fallen cliff, so named from its pyramidal form. The eastern part of the beach at Etretat is bordered by rocks which uncover at low water. Abreast of Etretat, the shoal bottom, with less than 8 fathoms, extends a mile off-shore, and, when the flood stream is at its greatest strength, a great eddy, named by local mariners the Hardiers, is formed and extends eastward as far as the Vaudieu rock, making the sea hollow and heavy when the wind is fresh from the eastward. IPORT, a fishing village and watering-place, 4\\ miles eastward of Etretat and W. by S. f S. 2\\ miles from the entrance to Fecamp, stands, like Etretat, at the entrance of a valley on low land near the sea, and is sheltered by a natural high shingle beach, strengthened by a small stone jetty and sea wall of masonry. The beach in front of the village is encumbered by rocks which uncover at low- water, and is not accessible to fishing boats until after the first hour's flood. The bluff point of Chicart witlr the rocks at its foot, afford a little shelter to the beach against westerly winds, but it is quite open northward, and when the sea is high the boats are hauled up on the beach. t t Between Etretat and Iport, at 1\\ miles from Etretat point, called also the Porte Orientale, and less than a cable from the cliffs, is the Guillemot rock, which resembles a ruined column and rises 160 feet above the rocks which uncover along the shore. Half way between this rock and the Porte Orientale, but a little nearer the cliffs than the Guillemot, is the great Vaudieu rock about 53 feet high, with a one -fathom patch just outside it. These two rocks, like the Etretat needle, seem to be the remains of ancient cliffs. The base of the"], [481, "Chap. X.] 459 ETRETAT. \u2014 IPORT. \u2014 FECAMP. Guillemot is so worn by the sea that it is probable it may fall ere long. FECAMP, of which the population in 1886 was 13,122, is a commercial, fishing, and refitting port of growing importance ; it is 9 miles eastward of cape d'Antifer, at the entrance of a fine valley watered by the rivers Valmont and Ganzeville. It consists of an outer tidal harbour, from which the Berigny wet dock and the Gayant tidal basin are entered. At the head of the latter is a large Bassin de Chasses or reservoir for flushing and scouring the harbour entrance by means of sluices. These flushings are not often required now, the extension of the South jetty in recent years having completely arrested the formation of the sand and gravel bar which formerly obstructed the entrance, and, in conjunction with extensive blasting operations in the rocky bed of the entrance channel, having caused a general deepening of the channel.* The entrance is open to N.W. by W., and is between two stone jetties at the foot of the high cliff forming Fagnet point, The jetty heads bear N.E. and S.W. from each other and are 227 feet apart, the channel narrowing to 131 feet within ; here, it was until recently enclosed by low wood-works or stockades which have been entirely removed, and the deep water channel within the jetty-heads is now marked by red lights or flags to be left on the port side in entering, and by green lights or flags on the starboard side. The entrance channel has about one foot of water at the lowest tides. The South jetty was formerly only 172 feet long, and was built at the end of the natural high shingle beach which shelters the harbour, to arrest the progress of the shingle along the coast from the South-west, and to oblige it to take a direction outwards from the entrance ; wdien extended, as before stated, level with the North jetty, it completely answered its purpose. The North jetty, 326 feet long, is built on the rocks which uncover at the foot of Fagnet point, and forms a con tinuation of the quay on the northern side of the harbour. The outer portion of both jetties is now straight instead of curved as formerly. The depth in the entrance channel is always greater than inside the harbour ; at high water, ordinary springs, it is 24 feet, and at neaps 18 feet. The back-water of Fecamp is very powerful for scouring out the channel when required, and it can be done both through the Gayant * See enlarged plan of Fecamp, on Admiralty chart, No. 2,612."], [482, "460 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. and Berigny basins. The sluices can always maintain the channel leading up to the lock gates of the Berigny basin, which, like the entrance channel, was deepened by removing the rocky bottom to a depth of 6 feet below low water, springs ; a bed of sand has formed over this rocky bottom, easily removed if required, but the depths throughout are now (1888) ample for the requirements of the port. The Tidal Harbour is nearly 2 cables long N.E. and S.W. by one cable wide, and dries 2 or 3 feet alongside the quays at low water, springs. A high and strong natural dyke of shingle cemented with mud forms its western side ; its other sides are bordered by quays. With a fresh westerly wind, a heavy sea runs into the entrance channel, and, reaching the interior of the harbour, occasions a surf distressing to vessels moored along the eastern quay and sometimes causes damage. The bottom for the most part is a mixture of chalky mud, sand, and gravel, and affords a tolerably good bed for grounding on. The Berigny Basin, or wet dock, is between the tidal harbour and the south-western angle of the Bassin de Chasses, into which flow all the running streams of the valley. The Berigny basin is 405 yards long in a S.E.-gE. direction from its entrance and 110 yards wide ; the bottom, of gravel cemented together by mud, is about the level of low water, springs ; the gates keep the water at a depth of 17 feet 8 inches, but at high water, springs, there are 24 feet 3 inches. New iron gates are about to be hung which will retain the water at the height of the tide of the day. The basin is surrounded by quays on which are steam cranes travelling on rails and all con veniences for loading and unloading. It communicates with the Gayant tidal basin by a lock 33 feet wide with 23 feet over the sill at high water, springs ; and, with the outer harbour, by means of a lock 54 feet wide, the sill of which is 6 feet below the level of low water, springs, and it admits vessels of any draught that can enter the harbour. The Gayant tidal basin is chiefly used by coasters and by the large deep sea fishing fleet equipped at Fecamp. Alterations are now (1888) in progress in this basin and in the Bassin de Chasses by which another tidal basin and wet dock will shortly be added to the port. The railway station is at the head of the Berigny basin ; it unites with the main line for Paris at Beuzeville. Havre is distant about"], [483, "Chap. X.] FECAMP. 461 24 miles by road, but Fecamp has no regular steam communication by sea with any port. It has large fish-curing establishments, and building yards where the Newfoundland and other deep sea fishing craft are constructed, as also a gridiron 150 feet long, but no dry dock. Repairs to vessels, both wood and iron, can be effected and moderate repairs to machinery. In 1887, the trade of the port, exclusive of its large fishing interest, was represented by the entry of 178 vessels of an aggregate of 44,869 tons. The exports are chiefly wines, spirits, flints, &c. ; the imports, coal, timber, wheat, cement, salt, &c. There is a good hospital available for seamen in cases of illness. Coals are always to be obtained, the average stock on hand being about 1,000 tons, and the port is convenient for steamers up to 300 feet in length. Vessels coal either in the Berigny or in the tidal basin, and from 200 to 300 tons can be put on board in a day. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on Fagnet point 120 yards eastward of the lighthouse. LIGHTS. \u2014 Fecamp lighthouse, a square tower 59 feet high, stands on the summit of Fagnet point at about 93 yards from the edge of the cliff and exhibits at 374 feet above high water a fixed ivhite light, dioptric and of the first order, visible 20 miles ; its position, on the crest of a hill rising abruptly from a deep grassy valley watered by abundant streams, causes it to be frequently obscured by mist or completely hidden by fogs. Fecamp harbour has the following lights : \u2014 South jetty. \u2014 A. fixed red light is shown from an iron standard 11 yards from the jetty-head, visible 5 miles. North j etty. \u2014 From a round turret 43 feet above high water and 58 yards within the jetty-head is exhibited a fixed white light, varied by a flash every three minutes ; the flashes are preceded and followed by short eclipses. This light is shown only whilst there are more than 10\u00a3 feet water in the entrance channel ; it is dioptric of the fourth order, and visible 12 miles in clear weather. A vessel approaching the harbour from the eastward does not open this light until it bears southward of S.W. by W., as, westward of that bearing, it is masked by Fagnet cliff. Fog bell. \u2014 A bell is sounded during foggy weather from the North jetty ; it sounds continuously for two minutes at short intervals ; during the intervals a single stroke of the bell denotes"], [484, "[Chap. X. 462 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. that there are 13 feet water in the channel ; 2 strokes, that there are 16\u00a3 feet, and so on. (See note, page 10.) Life-Boat.\u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Fecamp, and there is a mortar apparatus on each jetty. Tides.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Fecamp harbour at lOh. 44m. ; springs rise 23 feet ; neaps 17 feet. There are 24 feet in the entrance channel, at high water, ordinary springs, if it is clear of all deposit of shingle which appears now to create no difficulty. Strong westerly winds for several successive days raise the tides one or two feet higher in the harbour but cause a heavy sea at the entrance ; the contrary is the case with the wind from the eastward. The duration of slack water is not more than 15 or 20 minutes at the utmost, and consequently the entrance to the wet dock is only open for about half an hour. Tide Signals.\u2014 The usual tide signals are made from a flagstaff on the inner part of the South jetty, see page 8. Pilots. \u2014 Four qualified pilots are stationed at Fecamp ; their limits are, Saint-Jouin to the south- westward, and Veulettes to the north-eastward. Directions. \u2014 Fecamp harbour, since the great modern improve ments, is not generally difficult to enter, but it is dangerous when it blows strongly from the westward on account of the heavy sea off the entrance ; for, should a vessel then miss the harbour and ground on the rocks off Fagnet point, she would be totally lost. If the weather is doubtful, look out for the signal as to whether the harbour is practicable, see page 8, and, if not, haul off at once. A steam-tug is stationed at the port and every assistance is given to warp or track vessels in or out, boats and men being always ready at the entrance when the weather permits. Vessels arriving off the harbour towards low water, with the wind between W.S.W. and W.N.W., should steer for the land about Etretat, and keep to windward of the harbour until the tide serves to run in. With the wind between N.N.W. and E.N.E., the land should be made about Vattetot and Iport ; and, if the wind should come off-shore and there is a chance of losing the tide, anchorage may be found about 14; miles from the coast near the meridian of Iport in 10 fathoms water, and tolerably good holding ground, with Etretat needle on"], [485, "Chap. X.] FECAMP. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 463 with the Porte Orientale, and the bell tower of the abbaye at Fecamp on with the last slope of the hills a little southward of the houses of the town. On arriving only two or three hours before high water, a vessel might anchor closer in-shore but in such a position that she may be able to fetch the entrance of the harbour. These anchorages, however, are only good for a few hours, unless the weather is quite fine. One of the difficulties when entering Fecamp harbour is the eastern stream of flood, which continues to be felt across the jetty-heads for about half an hour after high water in the harbour and runs even at that time at the rate of 14 knots eastward along the coast at a cable outside the heads, so that a sailing vessel approaching the entrance on the starboard tack requires to be well to windward or she may be driven to leeward of the North jetty and miss the port. With a fair wind, or when close hauled, sufficient sail should be carried to get quickly into harbour, and it must be so balanced that the helm may be answered with the greatest promptitude. In heavy weather, the worst sea is from 250 to 350 yards outside the jetty-heads. With the wind from N.W. or N.E., squalls and baffling winds are very apt to occur when in the entrance channel. The method generally adopted when entering the harbour with a fair wind without the steam-tug, is to stand fairly in between the jetties and then the sails may be clewed up, and the vessel will be tracked up to her berth. If intending to enter the Berigny basin, the harbour should be entered at least three quarters of an hour before high water ; but, if the vessel is to remain in the tidal harbour, it may be entered later. Caution. \u2014 Care must be taken on quitting Fecamp harbour with a westerly wind, to avoid being drifted by the flood on the Charpen tiers shoals, which join the rocks at Fagnet point and extend west ward as far as the line of St. Leonard's spire on with the North jetty head S.S.W. To pass well outside the swell caused by these shoals, keep Grinval valley open, so that the new guard-house may appear above the middle of the cleft by which the descent is made to the beach. The Coast from Fecamp trends E. by N. 4 N. 10 miles to Catellier point and then E. \\ S. 5 miles to St. Valery-en-caux, and consists of the high perpendicular cliffs of chalk and flint before described intersected by numerous valleys, of which the greater part do not reach down to the level of the beach. A shelf of irregular rocks,"], [486, "464 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. which uncover at low water, borders the shore, but no part of it projects farther than about 3 cables from the cliffs, so that large vessels may approach the shore to about half a mile at any time of tide. The appearance of this part of the coast is dull and uniform ; the land seen above the cliffs is apparently level and only varied by occasional clumps of trees surrounding farms and villages. Above these trees occasionally appear church towers, the most conspicuous being those of Senneville, Sassetot, St. Martin-aux-Bunaux, Conteville, and St. Leger ; the last named stands near the edge of the cliff three quarters of a mile westward of St. Valery, has a tall isolated spire, and may be seen from a great distance in the offing. ST. VALERY-EN-CATJX, a town of 4,200 inhabitants, has a small bar harbour and is at the entrance of a narrow valley between high hills ; the depths at the entrance vary greatly according to the state of the bar, but, as a rule, it admits vessels of about 14 feet draught at high water, springs, but only fishing and small coasting craft during neaps ; as it has as yet no railway communication nearer than Motteville, on the Paris and Havre line, its trade is small, the annual entry of tonnage being about 13,000 and not increasing. Mackerel, herring, and cod fisheries are carried on, and coals, Baltic and Norway timber, wine, brandy, &c, are imported, vessels usually leaving in ballast. The port consists of a channel between two jetties of unequal length, leading into a small tidal harbour, and of a reservoir for backwater, a part of which serves as a wet dock. The western jetty is the longest ; it is 377 yards long, including 129 yards of open pile work. The eastern jetty is 169 yards long, its head bears from the western jetty-head S.E. by E. 100 yards, but the width between the jetties is only 65 yards at the outer parti and 40 yards at the inner. The width of the navigable channel is still further reduced by the vast mass of shingle which collects inside the channel against the West jetty leaving a space of only about 22 yards, and this space is with difficulty kept open along the East jetty by sluicing, and an average but by no means reliable depth of 20 feet preserved at high water, springs, and of 13 or 14 feet at neaps. The tidal harbour is 34^ acres in extent and has quays on its eastern and western sides, and a small building and repairing slip for fishing craft, In the centre it has about the same depth as the entrance channel, but dries as much as 13 feet alongside the quays ; the bottom is soft and good for grounding but strong northerly winds send in so much sea as not only to break vessels"], [487, "Chap. X.] 465 ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX. \u2014 BAR. away from their moorings but also to make it unsafe to open the lock gates into the wet dock. Vessels in the tidal harbour should be placed parallel with the quay and the moorings watched as the scouring water is let out, for its rapidity is such that it will under mine those which have grounded at right angles or diagonally to its direction. The wet dock or basin is a part of the flushing reservoir, 6 acres in size, the whole reservoir being 174 acres ; it communicates with the tidal harbour by means of a small lock 138 feet long with sluice gates 30 feet wide, and has a depth of 18 feet over the sill at high water, springs, and of 11 or 12 feet at neaps. The valley of St. Valery, of which the town and harbour occupy the entrance, is about two cables wide, and is at the head of a small bight in the coast. The rocky ledge which uncovers at the foot of the cliff along the coast has an opening in it in front of the valley, and the space between consists of a beach of chalky mud and cemented shingle 24; cables wide, on which the shingle, always working along from the westward, is deposited. The channel leading to the harbour runs through this beach, and its direction when between the jetties is about North and South. Bar. \u2014 The beach uncovers, during springs, one cable outside the western jetty, and the shingle borne from the westward forms on it a bar in front of the entrance, one end of which sometimes joins the West jetty-head, but generally leaves a channel from 40 to 50 yards wide between it and that jetty-head. The scouring water not having force enough to open a passage through the bar, runs out generally by its eastern end. The bar rises if westerly winds continue, and a south-westerly gale brings an enormous mass of shingle on the beach ; the higher the bar the more it extends north-eastward, forcing the outer part of the channel eastward. The entrance has sometimes been completely closed by shingle ; when this has occurred an opening has been made by manual labour, and increased by repeated scourings. Various improvements made in the entrance have, however, prevented the accumulation of gravel becoming so dangerous to navigation as formerly, though it is still very difficult to contend with, and there is almost always a high bank against the inner part of the West jetty, narrowing the entrance to the tidal harbour. When strong easterly winds blow for any length of time, the surf drives the shingle from the entrance, lowering the bar and dividing it into several parts, and then by copious flushings the channel is sometimes completely cleared.

East Jetty.\u2014 A fixed red light, visible 2 miles, is shown from the East jetty-head. Fog Signals.\u2014 At the West jetty-head, a bell gives 20 strokes followed by an interval of 20 seconds. A double stroke sounded in the middle of each interval denotes that there are 84_ feet or more in the entrance channel. (See note, page 10.) Tide Signals.\u2014 The usual tide signals, see page 8, are made from a mast on the West jetty ; \u2014 the signal-man also signals by hand the direction to take for the deepest water. Life-Boat.\u2014 There is a life-boat and also a mortar apparatus, at St. Valery-en-caux, in case of shipwreck. Pilots. \u2014 Three qualified pilots are stationed at this port, and, considering the varying depths and shifting nature of the bar, it need scarcely be added that no stranger should enter without a pilot. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the highest and most prominent point of the coast just westward of the entrance to Stl Valery-en-caux. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Valery-en-caux at lOh. 46m. springs rise 27 feet ; neaps 21^ feet. The depth in the entrance channel, however, as already explained, varies greatly, but about 20 feet at springs and 13 or 14 feet at neaps is the average ; with fresh westerly winds, the water is a foot higher, and, with easterly winds, a foot lower than the ordinary rise. During springs, when the outer shingle banks are all covered, the flood stream forms a great eddy in the elbow eastward of the jetties which runs westward along the shore of the elbow and along the outer side of the eastern jetty. This eddy, named the Sciade, much resembles the Verhaule at Havre ; a part of it, after rounding the East jetty-head, enters the entrance channel, whilst the principal portion crossing the channel obliquely, runs along the West jetty and rounds its head as soon as the flood stream outside slacks, which takes place about a quarter of an hour before high water. The eddy is usually"], [489, "Chap. X.] ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 467 more rapid with westerly than with easterly winds, and, with the former, when at its greatest strength shortly after high water, it assists to keep vessels in the channel. The flood stream continues to be felt at a short distance outside the jetties for more than half an hour after high water in the harbour, and is a great inconvenience when entering with westerly winds, or when the sea is high, if the entrance round the West jetty -head happens to be closed and it is necessary to round the bar well to the eastward to get into the entrance channel. Directions. \u2014 Vessels unable to enter St. Valery-en-caux harbour during neaps must keep at sea until springs, except with off-shore winds in fine weather, when they may anchor at from half to three quarters of a mile from the shore, between the guard-house at Cinq Trous and St. Leger, in from 5 to 10 fathoms water, tolerably good holding ground. Arriving off the entrance at springs, with only a few hours to wait for sufficient water, they should, with westerly winds, make short boards between Catellier point and St_ Leger, or if the wind is from the eastward they should maintain a position off the harbour. When standing in-shore, eastward of the entrance,, care must be taken to keep Catellier point well open north ward of the point formed by the cliffs near Sussette valley bearing about W. 4 S. to avoid the Ridins, a dangerous bank of sand and gravel E. by N. f N. three quarters of a mile from the West jetty head, on which are only 2 feet at low water, and a high sea during a weather tide. There is no difficulty in entering the harbour, whatever the direction of the wind, provided the entrance channel runs at the foot of the West jetty-head where there is then generally sufficient water at about 20 yards from the head at half an hour before high water, and if the wind does not admit of sailing between the jetties a vessel will be tracked in by a crew always in attendance ; but, it is difficult of access when the bar joins the foot of the West jetty-head and the only channel open is northward and eastward of the bar, and it would then be very imprudent to attempt it without a pilot, especially with the wind between South and West. When the state of the sea prevents pilots going out, they attend on the jetties to signal the course to be followed to round the bar and enter the channel. The most favourable moment to enter with westerly winds is when the Sciade or eddy is at its greatest strength, that is, from half an hour before to half an hour after high water ; the anchors should be clear and sufficient sail carried for the vessel to answer her helm quickly. With winds between North and East, it is advisable to enter before 2G 2"], [490, "[Chap. X. 468 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. the Sciade has acquired its full strength, for fear of being drifted on the West jetty. With northerly winds, there is a high sea on the bar and plenty of sail should be carried in crossing it, as the wind reflected by the cliffs decreases the force of the true wind and if the surf is not crossed rapidly a heavy sea may be shipped. There is not much difficulty in quitting the harbour, as it can only be attempted in moderate weather, but care must be taken to choose a favourable time of tide ; thus, with easterly winds, vessels should leave the jetty before high water whilst the flood stream has still much strength, but with westerly winds they should not leave until the ebb stream is well established. THE COAST. \u2014 From St. Valery-en-caux, the coast, a high per pendicular cliff of chalk and flint, trends E. 4 S. southerly 15 miles to Dieppe ; point d'Ailly, 5 miles westward of Dieppe, extending con siderably northward of that line. The first projecting point, 5 miles eastward of St. Valery is that of Sotteville, which may be known at a great distance by a heavy-looking church tower rising above the trees of the village from which the point takes its name, and by a conspicuous guard-house. The shelf of rock bordering the shore extends about 2 cables from this point, which should not be approached within 3| cables by vessels hugging the coast with off-shore winds. Raz de St. Michel. \u2014 Between Sotteville point and point d'Ailly are three wide valleys, separated by high cliffs, occupying half the interval between these points. The middle or St. Aubin's valley descends to the shore, and on its eastern side the waters of the river Dun open a passage through the shingle beach. The rocks which uncover at the foot of the cliffs extend 3 cables from the shore on both sides of this valley, and in front of it an irregular rocky bottom, with from 14 to 20 feet water, projects a mile from the shore. This extension, lying at right angles with the tidal streams, causes the raz or race of St. Michel, a strong eddy dangerous at low water to small vessels sailing near the coast with off-shore winds ; but, Catellier cliff kept well open of the point formed by the cliffs near Sussette valley W. 4 S. leads outside it, Point d'Ailly is of a rounded form, and although less elevated than many other points of the coast, may be easily recognised, as the perpendicular chalk cliff forms only half its height ; a thick bed of clay and vegetable mould, lying above the chalk, sloping down to the edge of the cliff."], [491, "Chap. X.] THE COAST.\u2014 POINT, LIGHT, AND ROCHES D'AILLY. 469 LIGHT. \u2014 A little within point d'Ailly stands a square tower, 66 feet high, which exhibits at 305 feet above high water, a revolving ivhite light, the eclipses of which take place every minute, but are not total within the distance of 12 miles. The light is dioptric, of the first order, and in clear weather may be seen 24 miles distant. Fog Signal.\u2014 At 328 yards south-westward of the lighthouse, a steam trumpet gives two consecutive blasts every forty seconds, each blast lasting three seconds with an interval between the two of two seconds ; the first blast is a high note, the second a low note. (See note, page 10.) Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station at point d'Ailly, 329 yards S.W. h W. from the lighthouse. Roches d'Ailly. \u2014 The shore eastward and westward of point d'Ailly, from the valley of Pourville to that of Quiberville, is bordered by the Roches d'Ailly, a bank consisting of blocks of freestone, which uncover at low water and terminate in a point half a mile N.N.E. of the lighthouse. The Galere, a rock with two heads, higher and larger than the rest, rises from the middle of the bank, and when its summit is covered there are about 21 or 22 feet water in the entrance to Dieppe. The square church tower of St. Jacques, at Dieppe, 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 open eastward of the cliff on which are the ramparts of the castle bearing E. by S. \u00a3 S. leads half a cable northward of the bank. Grand and Petit Eeamias and Ridin de Dieppe.\u2014 On the meridian of point d'Ailly, the western part of the Ridins or Ridges, those heaps of sand and broken shells noticed at page 456, is found ; they extend 11 miles in the offing, and eastward as far as the meridian of Treport. Those northward of point d'Ailly are divided into two groups, and not having less than 7 fathoms water, with from 12 to 15 fathoms round them, they can only be dangerous from the heavy sea on them in bad weather ; the Petit Eeamias, the northern group, lies 7 miles, and the Grand Eeamias, the southern group, 4 miles from the shore. Ridin de Dieppe. \u2014 The Ridins generally are not dangerous but the sea runs high in the eddies formed by them on a weather tide. The Ridin de Dieppe, or Frilandais, however, which lies N.N.E. E. easterly 10 miles from Dieppe, is an exception to this rule, for vessels of deep draught might strike on it at low water,"], [492, "470 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. springs, and small vessels are liable to ship heavy seas when crossing it in bad weather. When this part of the coast was surveyed in 1835 it was 2 miles in length, N.N.W. and S.S.E., the highest part being half a mile long, with from 23 to 27 feet water. As it is probable that these Ridins, being composed of substances easily set in motion, are liable to change their position, the mariner will act prudently when in their vicinity by keeping at a distance from any great eddies, their strength being generally in proportion to the shallowness of the water by which they are occasioned. The Tidal Streams follow the direction of the coast between St. Valery-en-caux and Dieppe, and their rate, at springs, is about 34^ knots ; but, near points Sotteville and d'Ailly they run 4 knots. About the time the rocks off point d'Ailly begin to cover, an eddy stream setting westward, commences in-shore off the Varengeville coast, and continues until the end of the flood. Under the lee of Dieppe West jetty also, at about a cable distance, a similar eddy is caused ; it runs westward close round the East jetty-head and joins the stream entering the harbour.* DIEPPE. f \u2014 This important and growing commercial and fishing port lies E. f S. 5 miles from point d'Ailly, and the town with its suburb, Le Pollet, occupies the entire entrance of a valley nearly a mile wide, wdiich is watered by the rivers Arques, Bethune, and Aure. The population of Le Pollet, which is eastward of Dieppe and connected with it by movable bridges, are chiefly engaged in the herring, oyster, and cod fisheries. The principal imports are coals, coke, timber, pig iron, woollen and cotton manufactured goods, agricultural machinery, pottery, &c. The exports are manufactured silks, Paris and Lyons goods, wines, spirits, fruits, vegetables, flints, &c. There are sugar refineries, rope-walks, paper-mills, ship yards, a gridiron in the outer port, and a heaving-down pontoon in the Berigny dock ; a graving dock is proposed, and until it is constructed heavy repairs to steamers or sailing vessels cannot be effected. The foreign and coasting trades are active, and, in 1887, 1,641 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 527,281 tons entered the port. Steamers ply daily between Dieppe and Newhaven, two or three times a week with Grimsby, and bi-monthly with Christiania. Dieppe being on one of the main routes between London and Paris is in * From observations made in 1878 it would appear that the strength of the tidal streams in the immediate neighbourhood of Dieppe is at least one knot less than is here given. t See Admiralty plan of the port of Dieppe, No. 1073 ; scale, m = 5 inches."], [493, "Chap, x.] DIEPPE. \u2014 DOCKS. 471 excellent and easy communication with all parts of France. The population in 1886 amounted to 23,050. There is a good hospital to which foreign sailors are admitted on payment for medical attendance, and there is a British Seamen's reading room supported by voluntary contributions. Coals can always be obtained in any quantity and at low price. Vessels are coaled either in the tidal harbour or in the basins. The port has undergone great improvements lately and important works are still (1888) in progress ; those completed since 1880 are, the setting back of the East pier, which increases the width of the channel to a minimum of 82 yards ; the lengthening of the West pier by 55 yards ; the rebuilding of several quays ; and, the construction of an additional basin or wet dock, and also a half -tide dock. In its present condition the port consists of an Outer port or tidal harbour with an area of 21 acres, a New port, also tidal and of about the same dimensions, and four wet docks or basins, viz : \u2014 the Duquesne, Berigny, Half- Tide, and New dock. Wet docks. \u2014 The Duquesne dock has an area of nearly 10 acres, is 54 feet wide at the entrance, and has 24 feet 6 inches over the sill at high water, springs, and 17 feet 8 inches at neaps ; it is in direct communication with the tidal harbour. The Berigny dock opens into the Duquesne, has an area of nearly 9 acres, is 46 feet wide at the entrance, and has 23 feet 4 inches over the sill at high water, springs, and 16 feet 7 inches at neaps. The Half-tide and New docks, both constructed in the bed of the old Bassin de Chasses, are entered from the New port. The Half-tide dock is 492 feet long and 328 feet wide ; the entrance gates are 59 feet wide, and have 33 feet over the sill of the N.W. gates at high water, springs, and 26 feet 4 inches at neaps ; the sill of the S.E. gates have 34 feet less. The New dock has a large area, being no less than 1,700 feet long by 360 feet wide, but a portion of the buildings in connection with it are not yet complete, and there are no quays on its eastern side. The dimensions of the entrance are the same as of the Duquesne. The new channel through the Pollet suburb, under construction, and to be completed in 1889, will give direct access from the Outer port to the New port and thus to the Half-tide and New docks with entrances 59 feet wide. Until this channel is completed, admission to these docks is through the Duquesne dock into the New port by the old sluice lock of the Retenue. The depth of the docks is that of the adjoining lock gates, except the"], [494, "[Chap. x. 472 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. Half -tide dock, in which there are 1 foot 6 inches of water at low water, springs. The docks have very extensive quay frontage, with rails laid, numerous steam cranes, and every appliance for loading and dis charging cargo. The Duquesne dock is opened every tide, day and night, for all vessels, but the Berigny dock is only opened at night for steamers. Admittance to the other docks is subject to certain conditions resulting from the works still in progress. The principal works now in progress (1888) are, the dredging and deepening of the entrance channel and outer harbour, the opening of the channel through the Pollet suburb to the New port before mentioned, and the erection of hydraulic machinery for the motive power of the port works. The harbour is sheltered from all winds, and its docks admit vessels of about 23 feet draught at high water, springs, and of about 17 feet at neaps ; the largest as yet received into the docks drew 20\u00a3 feet. Pilots. \u2014 Sixteen pilots and four assistants, under the orders of a chief pilot, are stationed at Dieppe, they cruise in the offing in decked boats. When the state of the sea is such as to prevent them boarding vessels in the offing, they remain on the jetty-heads and direct them by waving their hats. Vessels drawing 10 feet water may enter the channel from 2\\ to 3 hours before high water, and, with a fresh leading wind, for 3 hours after high water ; vessels of deep draught are usually taken in during the last hour of the flood. The bottom alongside the quays of the tidal harbour is a mixture of mud and shingle, it is about 3 feet at the North quay, and 4 or 5 feet at the South quay above the level of ordinary spring tides. Vessels here are exposed to considerable surf when the sea is high at the entrance, especially when there are only from 6 to 10 feet water in the entrance channel. The Entrance Channel is on the eastern side of the valley nearly 2 cables from the high cliffs of Femme-Grosse point ; it is about 650 yards long and commencing in a S.S.E. direction curves southward and then westward into the Outer or tidal harbour, at the south-eastern corner of which is the new channel under construction into the New port. Its inner part is enclosed between the northern quays of the town and Le Pollet suburb. The outer part of the channel was formerly liable to be obstructed by shingle driven alongshore during westerly winds, and the scouring waters could not keep down these"], [495, "Chap, x.] DIEPPE. \u2014 PILOTS. \u2014 LIGHTS. 473 accumulations ; modern improvements, however, seem to have over come the difficulty. In 1882 the shingle bar was only just above the level of low water, springs; since then, the depths have been increased and maintained by dredging, the flushings being no longer necessary. The bottom of the channel and Outer port are still undergoing dredging, with the object of obtaining a depth at low water, ordinary springs, of 8 feet throughout ; practically it may be considered now (1888) as at about the level of low water, equinoctial springs. A high sea runs at the entrance with winds from W.S.W. round by West to N.E. ; those from the westward, especially, cause a heavy confused sea. LIGHTS. \u2014 The following lights are established on the jetties at Dieppe. \"West jetty. \u2014 A. fixed white light, dioptric and of the fifth order, is shown at 43 feet above high water from a stone tower 38 yards from the old jetty-head and visible in clear weather from a distance of 10 miles. A fixed green light of small power is shown provisionally from the outer end of the prolongation of the West jetty. It is 62 yards out side the white light, and is 24 feet above high water. To avoid the works projecting from the West jetty-head, vessels should pass at least 13 yards clear of the green light, the position of which, during the day, is marked by a green flag. Fog bell. \u2014 A fog bell is sounded from the house on the West jetty continuously for 2 minutes, at short intervals ; one stroke sounded in the intervals indicates a depth of 13 feet in the entrance channel, 2 strokes, Vo\\ feet, and so on ; see note, page 10. East Jetty.\u2014 Fixed and Tidal Lights.\u2014 Three fixed white lights are shown from a mast 11 yards from the East jetty-head ; they are respectively 22^, 30, and 35^ feet above high water. The lower light is permanent throughout the night and is visible at 10 miles. The middle light is tidal, visible 10 miles, and is shown from 2 .', hours before until 2 hours after high water. The upper light is also tidal and\" visible 10 miles ; it is lighted 2 hours before, and extinguished at high water. The two latter are not lighted when from the state of the sea the harbour is inaccessible. As a guide to vessels entering, when from the state of the weather pilots cannot get on board, the mast which"], [496, "CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. 474 carries the lights is kept in a vertical position while the vessel pre serves her proper course ; but, should she deviate, the mast is inclined to that side towards which she should steer. Vessels desirous of profiting by these signals should show two lights, one forward and one aft. A fixed white light is shown from a beacon erected near the East jetty, westward of the southern portion of the breakwater ; the beacon serves to indicate the position of the piles of the old pier, and by day carries a red flag. Tide Signals.\u2014 The usual tide signals, see page 8, commencing from a depth of 6| feet, are made from a flagstaff on the West jetty. A ivhite flag with blue border, hoisted at the entrance of the harbour indicates that the basins are open. Special Signals for steamers.\u2014 When one or more steamers are about to enter or quit the port, a red flag is hoisted at the outer end of the West jetty, and also at the inner end of the East jetty ; whilst these are displayed, access to the entrance channel is forbidden to all other vessels ; those already within it, however, are to continue their movements. A ivhite flag with a blue border hoisted above a red flag indicates that vessels may enter but not leave the port, The same flags reversed, that vessels may leave but not enter. At night, red and ivhite lights are substituted for the flags. The tide signals as well as the special signals are repeated approximately from two masts near the semaphore. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the cliff of la Femme-Grosse, 530 yards from the entrance to Dieppe and E.N.E. from the lighthouse on the West jetty.

There are in the entrance channel and Outer port about 29 feet at ordinary springs ; 31 feet at equinoctial springs ; and, 22 or 23 feet at neaps. At spring tides, high water slack lasts 10 minutes ; at neaps, 30 or 40 minutes. Fresh westerly winds cause the tide to rise a foot or 18 inches higher than in calm weather, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. The highest tide takes place about 52 hours after full and change, and the least tide occurs about 63 hours after the quadrature. The mean duration of the rising tide on the beach at Dieppe is 5h. 40m., and of the falling tide 6h. 45m."], [497, "Chap, x.] DIEPPE. \u2014 TIDES. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 475 A Life-Boat is stationed at Dieppe, and there is a mortar life saving apparatus on each pier. Directions. \u2014 The hill and cliff separating the valleys of Pour ville and Dieppe, and the chapel of St. Nicholas on the summit of the hill, are marks which assist in recognising the position of Dieppe when approaching it from the northward or north-westward. The valley of Pourville is the most remarkable valley on this part of the coast, being the only one eastward of point d'Ailly that descends to the beach ; it is watered by the little river Scic, which finds a passage through the shingle to the sea. Two steam-tugs are stationed at this port, and a vessel of deep draught arriving off it during neaps is entitled to a pilot to take charge of her at sea, until there is sufficient depth to enter at springs. When standing for the land with westerly winds towards the hour of low water, a position to windward should be maintained by making short tacks between point d'Ailly and St. Nicholas' chapel until there is water to run for the West jetty-head ; with easterly winds, a vessel should keep on the meridian of the chapel. With off-shore winds in fine weather, or in a calm, she may anchor for a few hours in 34; fathoms water, about half a mile from the shore, North or N.N.W. of St. Nicholas' chapel. This anchorage is called Dieppe road, but it affords no shelter with northerly winds and should be left with all speed, and a good offing gained, if there is any appearance of wind from that direction. In standing for the harbour, the West jetty-head should be steered for, whatever the direction of the wind, because, at half a cable outside the jettyr-heads, the eastern stream continues to be felt 40 minutes after high water in the harbour, and it runs at the rate of H knots during the whole time vessels of deep draught can enter. With a light wind, if this precaution is not taken, the vessel will be drifted eastward of the entrance. The West jetty-head should be approached with caution, and, if no pilot is on board, sufficient sail should be carried to execute quickly any change of course the pilots on the jetty may direct. Moderate winds from N.N.W. round by North to E.N.E. are the most favourable for entering Dieppe ; with all other winds it is necessary for a vessel either to secure the services of a steam-tug, or to steer for the weather jetty to be tracked in. The valley of Dieppe has a great influence on the direction of off-shore winds ; thus, if the wind is E.S.E. in the offing it will be S.S.E. at the entrance of the harbour ; and, if West outside, it will be S.W. in the harbour and"], [498, "476 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. entrance channel. W.S.W. winds are reflected by the high cliff between Le Pollet suburb and Femme-Grosse point, and their force much weakened ; a vessel, therefore, running for the harbour with the wind between W.S.W. and W.N.W. should carry good sail to cross the broken water caused by these winds at the entrance. The COAST from Dieppe trends E. by N. 4 N. Northerly 13^ miles to Treport, and, like that westward of Dieppe, consists of high per pendicular cliffs of chalk and flint, intersected by numerous valleys. The telegraph cable connecting with Beachy head leaves the shore, a short distance eastward of Dieppe. The land adjacent to the cliffs is slightly undulating, the highest parts being in the vicinity of Penly village and on the western point of the entrance of Criel vallejr, where the cliff is surmounted by Mont Joli-bois, a remarkable conical mound covered with heath, of which the base is half a mile wide.* The valleys, which may be recognised from the offing, are those of Puits, Belleville, Berneval, PenlyT, Neuvillette, Criel, and Mesnil. Puits valley descends to the shore a mile eastward of Dieppe, and at the top of its eastern steep edge are the remains of the Camp de Cesar, an ancient Roman encampment. The valleys of Berneval and Penly, the third and fourth eastward of Dieppe, are separated by perpendicular high land, a third of a mile in length, and communicate with the beach by ravines hollowed out bjT the floods caused by heavy rains. Criel valley, at the foot of Mont Joli-Bois, is half a mile wide at its entrance and is watered by the little river Yeres, which forces a passage for itself through the beach. When off the entrance of the valley, with it bearing S. by W. or S.S.W., the little town and spire of Criel will be seen up the valley about a mile from the shore. The valley of Mesnil is 2 miles westward of Treport, and is the last valley before reaching that place ; it descends almost to the level of the beach. The whole of this coast is bordered by a rocky ledge which dries at low water, and a large quantity of shingle is heaped up at the foot of the cliffs. Throughout the greater part of its extent, the ledge is not more than 2 cables wide, but in three places it projects farther and is dangerous to small vessels hugging the coast with off shore winds. From abreast of Belleville valley to the rocks at the foot of Mers cliff, eastward of Treport, a beach of muddy sand and gravel dries at low water in front of the ledge bordering the shore. Roches du Heaume. \u2014 The westernmost projection of this ledge * See Admiralty chart :\u2014 North coast of France, sheet XIII., Dieppe to Boulogne.

X.] DANGERS OFF DIEPPE AND TREPORT. 477 extends half a mile from the shore in front of Berneval and Penly valleys ; the rocks are uneven, and the Roches du Heaume, the highest heads, uncover 5 or 6 feet at its outer edge. Roches du Muron. \u2014 The second projection of the ledge fronts the valley of Mesnil ; it extends 4 cables from the shore, and on it are the Roches du Muron, a rocky group which uncovers 8 feet and bears N.W. 3 cables from the guard-house at Mesnil. The Haumes and Granges Rocks, the easternmost projection of the ledge, lie three quarters of a mile westward of the entrance to Treport and 34; cables from the cliffs ; they consist of small ridges of rock rising above the sands. The Haumes, the western ridge, has several heads, of which the highest uncovers 85 feet. The Granges, the eastern ridge, is nearly 4 cables from the West jetty of Treport, and its highest part at the south-eastern point of the ridge uncovers 6 feet ; its northern part, W. by N. \u00a3 N. 3 cables from the jetty-head, uncovers only a foot. Between the Granges and the Haumes there is an isolated rock which uncovers 14f feet. Between the meridians of Dieppe and Treport, the bottom is uneven and the depths irregular as far as 4 or 5 miles from the shore. The principal inequalities met with are the heaps of sand and broken shells named the Ridins de Belleville, de Neuvillette, de Treport, and the Franc-Marque bank. Ridins de Belleville, about 3 miles from the shore in a N.N.W. direction from Berneval valley, are narrow ridges running parallel with each other in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, the least water on them being about 25 feet. The tidal streams occasion strong eddies amongst these ridges, and vessels subject themselves to a heavy sea by crossing them in bad weather during a weather tide ; see also remarks on Ridins, pages 456 and 469, 470. Ridins de Neuvillette are small narrow sand-banks, on which there are from 3f to 5 fathoms. They commence about 6 cables from the shore abreast of Neuvillette valley and extend nearly 2 miles into the offing. The eddies on them are in general less dangerous than those on the Ridins de Belleville. Ridins de Treport are four narrow ridges running parallel with each other in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, at from 2\\ to 34^ miles from the coast, and 1\\ miles in extent from East to West. The westernmost ridge, N.W. 3| miles from the entrance of Treport, has only 22 feet water ; the others have from 23 to 25 feet on their highest parts."], [500, "[Chap. X. 478 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. Bane Franc-Marque, from its south-western extreme, N. | E. If miles from the entrance of Treport, is 14, miles long in a N.E. \\ E. and S.W. \\ W. direction, and 7 cables wide, with depths of from 13 to 17 feet. It appears to be the outer part of the bank, equally shoal, which extends from the shore, and, trending W.S.W., joins it with a depth of 19 feet. Anchorage.\u2014 The holding ground is in general good along the coast between Dieppe and Treport, and vessels may anchor with off shore winds during an adverse tide, but in such a position that they can gain an offing should the wind change and blow on the land. From Mont Joli-Bois to Treport there are many patches where the bottom consists of a black substance which appears to be peat, and here the anchors penetrate so deeply that they are difficult to weigh. There is anchorage to await tide, with off-shore winds and fine weather, 2 miles westward of Treport and 14, miles from the shore abreast of Mesnil valley, in 7 fathoms, sand and broken shells. The mariners of Treport call this the Petite rade ; the Grande rade is half a mile farther out and has excellent holding ground with muddy bottom. At either anchorage a vessel should weigh and quit the coast at the first appearance of bad weather. A bottom, on which the soundings are less than 5 fathoms, extends a mile from the shore in front of Criel valley, and again at Treport, from whence its outer edge runs parallel with the coast as far as the meridian of Mers and then turns back westward round the Franc-Marque bank, leaving a small deep with excellent holding ground in 44^ fathoms water, between that bank and the shore. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the edge of the cliff nearly half a mile westward of Treport, r TREPORT is a commercial and fishing port with a population of about 4000, situated at the entrance of Bresle valley, the easternmost but one of all those valleys which break the uniform outline of the cliffs between cape d'Antifer and the river Somme. The entrance to the valley is half a mile wide, between abrupt hills rising 295 feet above the sea, and at the foot of the cliff in the southern part of the valley stands the town of Treport, its houses overlooked by a terrace and a large church built half way up the hill. The village of Mers stands on the slope of the hills on the northern side of the valley ; and, a little eastward of it, on a plain surrounded by hills covered with wood, is the Chateau d'Eu and the town of that name."], [501, "Chap, x.] TREPORT. 479 The railway station is on the northern side of the port close to the sea ; by it, Treport is connected with the northern net-work of railways by a branch line to Longpre-les-corps-Saints. The opening of this line gave a great impulse to trade, and projects for the improve ment of the port, including the lengthening of the jetties and deepen ing of the channels, were at once taken in hand and have been in great measure carried out. The principal imports are coal and timber ; the exports, the products from the Bresle valley and goods from mid-France, and even from Switzerland ; this trade is main tained chiefly by a service of small steamers going or returning twice a week between here and London. Exclusive of a large fishing trade, about 250 vessels of 45,000 tons enter the port annually, one third being steamers. The port consists of the entrance channel between two wooden jetties, a tidal harbour, a wet dock, and an immense reservoir of scouring water immediately behind the tidal harbour with a surface of 200,000 square yards, communicating with the river Bresle by means of the Penthievre canal. The entrance channel is obstructed by a high bank fronting the West pier, and by a bar abreast of it rising 3 or 4 feet above the general level of the bottom of the channel ; in fine weather, therefore, the harbour admits vessels of about 16 feet draught at high water, springs, and of 9 or 10 feet draught at neaps ; and, being at the head of the elbow formed in the coast between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez, it offers a useful refuge to small craft driven in-shore by stress of weather between Dieppe and the mouth of the river Somme. Bar. \u2014 The beach, which uncovers 2 cables outside the West jetty head, is bounded westward by the Haumes and Granges rocks already described, and eastward, by the rocks which dry at the foot of the high cliffs at Mers point, It is a mixture of sand, gravel, and shingle cemented together by chalky mud, and forms a hard ground on which a high sea runs with an on-shore wind. With hard north westerly winds, the shingle drifting from the westward accumulates before and in the entrance and forms a high bank which joins the West jetty-head, extending from thence in a N.N.E. and N.E. direction. In 1878 this bank uncovered 19 feet, and in 1882 it almost closed the port and necessitated the cutting of a channel right through it. Since this was done, the lengthening of both jetties has been accomplished and the channel extended about 120 yards sea ward. It is impossible to speak with confidence of the permanent effect of these works until farther experience has been obtained."], [502, "480 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. The Entrance Channel is about 2 cables long in a S. by E. \\ E. direction from the West jetty-head ; its eastern side is formed by the East jetty abutting against the western extreme of the natural beach which protects Bresle valley from the sea and shelters the harbour from the northward ; this jetty has been lengthened about 35 yards since the year 1886. Its western side is bounded by the wall which supports the terrace joining the quays of the harbour, and by open pilework, the top of which serves as a road for the tracking crew and forms a communication between the terrace and the West jetty-head. The West jetty is now (1888) more than 200 yards long and joins the terrace near the commencement of the open pilework. The deepest side of the channel is near the East jetty. The Tidal Harbour is 14^ cables long and a cable wide. The freestone bottom is visible almost throughout its whole extent, but at the foot of the quays it is covered with mud and shingle sufficiently soft to ground on. The best berths are in the northern angle of the harbour close to the railway, where the little London steamers lie and unload. In all other parts, with on-shore winds, there is much surf, and vessels strike heavily before they ground. The wet dock or basin is 1,476 feet long East and West, by 115 feet wide ; it is formed at the mouth of the river Bresle, that river being deepened and embanked as a canal from the basin at Treport to Eu, having 13 feet water, and terminating in a small wet dock in the north-western part of that town. The lock entrance at Treport is 254; feet wide at the bottom, has 13 feet over the sill at high water, springs, and is 147^ feet long, communicating with the harbour by means of double floodgates ; it retains at all times a depth of 13 feet to enable vessels that can enter it to remain afloat, the surplus waters of the Bresle flowing over a weir into the tidal harbour. The improvements now (1888) in progress at Treport have for their object the general deepening of the entrance channel and tidal harbour, in order to admit vessels of 164^ feet at all tides. Pilots.\u2014 Two pilots and two assistant pilots are stationed at Treport, they also conduct vessels by the canal to Eu. Their services can always be obtained in moderate weather, and, considering the shifting nature of the shingle banks at the entrance and the alterations in progress at the port, no stranger should attempt this harbour without a pilot. LIGHTS.\u2014 A red tower stands at the new West jetty-head at Treport, 370 feet outside the position of the old lighthouse ; from"], [503, "Chap, x.] TREPORT. \u2014 DIRECTIONS 481 it, a fixed ivhite tidal light is shown so long as there are 64^ feet water in the shoalest part of the bar and entrance channel. The light is dioptric, of the fifth order, 44 feet above high water, and visible in clear weather at 9 miles. An additional red light is shown if from any cause the entrance is impracticable. A. fixed red light, visible 5 miles, is shown from an iron pole at 23 feet above the sea and 21 feet from the outer end of the East jetty. Fog Signal. \u2014 In foggy weather a bell is sounded from the West jetty, see note, page 10. It gives 14 strokes every 12 seconds ; a double stroke in the intervals signifies that there are at least 64 feet water in the channel. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Treport at llh. 9m., springs rise 27 feet, neaps 21 feet. Slack water lasts 10 or 15 minutes at springs, but with north-easterly winds its duration is half an hour. Tidal Signals. \u2014 The usual tide signals, see page 8, are made from a mast on the West jetty whilst there are 64 feet and upwards in the shallowest part of the bar and entrance. A red flag at the same mast indicates that the entrance is im practicable. A white flag with blue border hoisted at the mast at the lock entrance indicates that the basin is open. A blue flag at the mast on the East pier and at the sluice gates of the Bassin de Chasses indicates that they are or are about to be opened. The signal-staff on the East jetty works on a pivot and has two black vanes. When the pilots are unable to board vessels in the offing, they incline it to the right or left, according as the vessel should keep to starboard or to port. When the movable part is kept horizontal, the entrance is inaccessible. Directions. \u2014 If a vessel's draught admits of her entering Treport, she has nothing to fear in ordinary weather from the banks and Ridins in its vacinity, but for the reasons already given they should be avoided when there is much wind. In running for the harbour from the west ward or northward, with westerly winds, much before high water, the land should be made about Criel valley, under Mont Joli-Bois, so that a position may be retained to windward of the harbour until there is sufficient depth to enter. At night, the lights of Ailly and Cayeux are excellent guides for Treport. A. '2771. Wt. 7242. 2H"], [504, "[Chap. X. 482 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. With a strong S.W. wind, to avoid passing too close to the Haumes and Granges rocks on which the sea breaks even at high water, the East pier-head should be brought a little open of the West pier-head before hauling in for the latter. Vessels of the deepest draught the port admits should enter between half an hour before and half an hour after high water, springs ; and, as the flood or north-eastern stream runs across the entrance at the rate of from 14^ to 2 knots at 3 or 4 cables outside the jetties, and continues to be felt with less velocity until lj hours after high water, they must avoid being drifted to leeward of the entrance, which, however, is rarely missed in moderate weather. In running for the harbour with a strong wind from the offing, when the pilots cannot go out to meet vessels and the sea is high on the beach and bar, the anchors should be clear for letting go, hawsers coiled on deck, an anchor ready to moor by the stern, and sufficient sail carried to perform any necessary man\u0153uvre. These arrange ments being completed, and no signal being made that the bar is not practicable, steer to pass close to the West jetty-head and watch for indications of alterations in the course being made at the flagstaff on the East jetty, or, as it is approached, by the pilots on the West jetty, who indicate by signs the courses to be steered in entering the channel. With a strong westerly wind, should a vessel be driven to leeward of the entrance and be unable to regain an offing, she should anchor and wait until the ebb stream commences, if the state of the weather permits, and then weigh and gain an offing ; but, if the sea is too high near the shore, where indeed the holding is not good, she should anchor in the small deep under the lee of the Franc-Marque bank, see page 478, where she will be in some degree sheltered, and with two anchors down and a long scope of cable out she might ride out the flood and gain an offing on the ebb. If the wind is too far north ward to reach this deep or to claw off the coast, the only resource is to run stem on the shingle beach with all sail set, as near as possible to the East jetty ; the shingle yields readily under a vessel, and if she takes the ground near the top of high water the crew will be saved. With off-shore winds, the harbour should be entered before high water. With a moderate wind and smooth sea, a vessel may easily get close in to the West jetty-head, and a crew is always at hand on one or the other jetty, according to the direction of the wind, to track in. With strong off-shore winds, violent squalls come down from the cliffs and out of the valleys, and it often happens that when standing"], [505, "(Jhap. x.] DIRECTIONS FOR TREPORT. \u2014 CAYEUX. 483 for the jetty on the starboard tack, a vessel is taken aback in the midst of the rollers on the bar. When leaving the harbour, bound northward, in order to avoid the banks which uncover at the mouth of the Somme river and which ex tend as far out as the bearing N.E. \\ N. from the entrance to Treport, do not go eastward of the line of the eastern extreme of the wood surrounding Grange farm, above Treport, a quarter of a point open westward of the summit of the cliff at Mers point bearing about S.W. by S. ; bearing in mind that the flood stream runs eastward for at least 1\\ hours after high water in the harbour and for still longer in proportion as the distance from the shore is increased. THE COAST.\u2014 The white cliffs bordering the coast from cape de la Heve terminate at the eastern part of the town of Ault, which lies E. by N. \\ N. about 4 miles from Treport and occupies the entrance and the north-eastern slope of a deep narrow valley at the head of the bight between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez. Nine valleys break the uniformity of the coast between Treport and Ault, and the shore is bordered by a rocky shelf which in some places uncovers a quarter of a mile from the cliffs at low water, the sea leaving a narrow space of hard sand in front of the shelf. The hills trend away from the shore in an E. by N. direction from Ault to the left bank of the river Somme and the coast becomes low, the hills joining by easy slopes the alluvial plain which lies between them and the sea. This plain is low, marshy, and level, and is defended from the sea by a natural high shingle beach. Behind the beach, which is 2 cables -wide, are meadows and cultivated lands, and in front it slopes down to hard sands which uncover half a mile out. The coast between Treport and Cayeux is inaccessible with on shore winds, and a heavy sea runs in upon it during westerly gales. The beach between Ault and the first guard-house northward of it is exposed to all the violence of winds between W.S.W. and N.W., and the high sea occasioned by these winds drives the shingle collected at the foot of the cliffs between Treport and Ault rapidly towards and beyond the guard-house. After westerly gales, it frequently happens that little or no shingle remains on this part of the beach, and but for a small artificial dyke constructed here, the sea would undoubtedly make an inroad on the plain. Cayeux. \u2014 The low coast which commences at Ault trends nearly in a straight line 5 miles north-eastward to the town of Cayeux which is a mile in extent and stands on the shore in the midst of sand hills. The town is partly inhabited by fishermen, who, as the coast 2H2"], [506, "484 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. affords no shelter, haul their boats up above high-water mark in summer, and, in winter, place them in the little harbour of Hourdel within the mouth of the Somme. The only remarkable objects on this part of the coast are the houses of Cayeux, its church, particularly the bell tower, and five windmills in and around the town. In westerly gales, the sea heaps up, in front of the northern part of the town, a great quantity of sand, which is carried away by high winds into the interior. Within a mile southward of Cayeux church is a sheet of water named the Hable d'Ault, where the greater part of the fresh water of the plain is collected. Until the year 1767 this Hable (a corruption of the word havre or haven) communicated with the sea by a channel into which the fishing-boats of Ault and Cayeux, as well as small coasters, could run for shelter, but successive invasions of shingle filled it up. Vessels of deep draught should not approach the coast between Mont Joli-Bois and Cayeux, nor should small vessels unless bound to Treport or the river Somme. The depth is only 5 fathoms at 3 miles from the shore between Treport and Cayeux ; outside this, the soundings generally increase slowly to 8 and 9 fathoms at 6 or 7 miles in the offing, but, as before explained, vessels must be on their guard against small banks or Ridins with less than 5 fathoms on them. The sand-banks which uncover at the mouth of the Somme extend south-westward beyond Cayeux ; with Cayeux church bearing S.E. by E., they dry out nearly 14^ miles from the shore at spring tides. LIGHTS. \u2014 A round white tower, which at a distance resembles a Doric column, stands near the shore one mile north-eastwrard of Cayeux ; it exhibits, at 92 feet above high water, a fixed white light, varied every four minutes by a bright flash which is preceded and followed by a short eclipse. The light is dioptric, of the third order, and visible in clear weather at 15 miles ; but, the local fog rising from the low damp ground covered with wood in the rear of the lighthouse sometimes obscures it. Tide Light.\u2014 A fixed white tidal light, visible 6 miles, is shewn from a mast 3,835 yards S.W. by W. southerly from Cayeux light, as a guide to the South channel into the Somme. It is lighted at 34 hours flood, and extinguished at 14 hours ebb."], [507, "Chap. X.] 485 CAYEUX. \u2014 ESTUARY OF THE SOMME.

Tide Signals. \u2014 Day tide signals, see page 8, are made at the port of Hourdel, at Cayeux lighthouse flagstaff, and at the tidal light south-westward of Cayeux. At Hourdel, commencing at a depth of 9| feet, every rise of 1 foot 8 inches is signalled, and repeated at Cayeux lighthouse ; but, at the tidal light station, only the rising or falling of the tide is signalled by the hoisting of a flag from 3^ hours before high water at the entrance of the South pass, to 1\u00a3 hours after high water. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station about 100 yards south-westward of Cayeux lighthouse. Life Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Cayeux. The ESTUARY Of the SOMME\u2014 This estuary lies between the town of Cayeux and St. Quentin point, which bear N.E. by N. and S.W. by S. from each other, distant 6\u00a3 miles. It is bounded on the South by the plain of which Cayeux occupies the north-western angle, and, on the North and North-east, by the low lands of Marquen terre and the Favieres marshes. The little harbours of Hourdel, St. Valery-sur-Somme, and Crotoy, are within the estuary ; the two first on the southern, the last on the northern bank. Vessels of from 15 to 18 feet draught can get up to Hourdel harbour at springs, and of 8 feet draught at neaps. The Crotoy channel, when not obstructed by sand-banks, as it sometimes is, admits vessels of 12 or 13 feet draught at ordinary springs. The channel leading up to St. Valery has been so improved that vessels drawing 13 or 14 feet can easily get up to that town, which is the outport to Abbeville, with which it communicates by a canal 74. miles long. Left Bank of the Somme. \u2014 From Cayeux, the left bank of the river takes a north-easterly direction for 34 miles to Hourdel point and is 6kirted by an immense quantity of shingle of an average breadth of 3 cables, which, as far as 2 miles from Cayeux, is covered by sand-hills of moderate height ; but, from Cayeux lighthouse to Hourdel point, the shingle is uncovered and lies in a series of undula tions, parallel with each other, and with the shore. Hourdel point in many respects resembles Hoc point in the Seine ; both increase by successive deposits of shingle, and the eddy on the flood has given them nearly the same shape."], [508, "[Chap. X. 486 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. Between Hourdel point and St. Valery-sur-Somme, the shore is low and, until lately, formed a bay 2\u00a3 miles long and half a mile deep, the land being defended from the incursion of the sea by an embank ment, in front of which was some marshy land and a wide beach, parts of which hardly covered at high water, springs ; the whole of this bay has now either nearly filled up or been reclaimed. The town of St. Valery with its suburb La Ferte* occupies a space of 14^ miles along the shore, and is built on the northern slope of a group of hills forming the northern point of the high land between the rivers Somme and Bresle ; the north-western hill, the most conspicuous from the offing, has on its summit a clump of tall trees and a windmill. The harbour of St. Valery is at the eastern part of the town, and for all practical purposes the navigation of the Somme ends here ; for, since the waters of this river and of the streams flowing into it above Abbeville have been diverted into and run out by the canal, the sand which the flood stream drives into the river has in a great measure filled up its former bed, so that even lighters drawing about 3 feet water can hardly get up to the village of Grand Port, on the right bank, 5 miles above St. Valery. Right Bank of the Somme. \u2014 The northern shore of this estuary trends in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction ; the most con spicuous object on it is the little town of Crotoy, built on a pro jecting point 24. miles E. by S.f S. from Hourdel point, and 1% miles N.N.E. from St. Valery ; the ruins of its fortifications, four windmills showing above the ruins, the church tower, and the roofs of some of the houses, serve to mark its position from a distance. The coast for 4 miles eastward of Crotoy is low, and an embank ment follows all its sinuosities, protecting the adjacent land from the sea. The southern part of St. Quentin point, as seen from Crotoy, is about 4 miles N.N.W. 4 W. from that town, and, in the intervening space, the coast recedes a mile and forms a bay, at the head of which the little river Maie, which receives a large portion of the waters of the Marquenterre, loses itself running over the beach. The only objects that attract attention on this low coast are the windmill at St. Pierre, three quarters of a mile northward of Crotoy, and St. Firmin church tower, N.N.E. 3 miles from Crotoy. St. Quentin Point is rounded and is a slight projection a mile and a half northward of the point visible from Crotoy, and from which the coast undergoes a sudden change in direction. The"], [509, "Chap, x.] RIVER SOMME. \u2014 BANKS. \u2014 CHANNELS. 487 only object which serves to mark St. Quentin point from seawTard, is a guard-house built among the sand-hills on the point, These hills are higher than those on the coast to the S.S.E. and may be seen in clear weather 8 or 10 miles distant. Banks in the mouth of the Somme. \u2014 The whole space included between the shores of the estuary just described, is nearly filled with an immense mass of sand which uncovers and which extends 14^ miles seaward of a line drawn from Cayeux to St. Quentin point. The surface of this sand is subject to great changes from the effect of wind and tide, it being every day furrowed afresh by the tidal streams and heaped into banks of which the shape and height are extremely variable. From the parallel of Cayeux to that of St. Quentin point, the banks at the entrance taken as a whole slope gradually seaward but are steep towards the land ; their high parts extend from N.W. of Cayeux lighthouse to North of Hourdel point and are not covered at the lowest neaps ; the highest part of all in the northern part of the bay, called l'llet by the fishermen, is nearly 30 feet above low-water mark and only covers at the highest spring tides. Entrance Channels. \u2014 None but fishing-boats or small coasters, piloted by local seamen, can enter the Somme by the narrow winding channel under St. Quentin point. The two principal entrances are through the southern part of the banks ; the entrance to the South pass being abreast of Cayeux, and that of the North-west pass, north-westward of the lighthouse. These passes are subject to such incessant changes from the shifting of the sands that a detailed description of them is impossible. They always, however, show a disposition to return to or to regain very nearly the positions assigned them on the Admiralty Chart. They are separated from each other by a bank, of which some parts uncover 11 or 12 feet at the lowest tides. The two channels meet and form one channel, sometimes above and sometimes below Hourdel, but again separate ; one portion taking the direction of Crotoy, the other of St. Valery. Though their outer parts are nearly dry at low water, they do not dry throughout, but, as far as the meridian of St. Quentin point, have a succession of depressions, some with as much as 18 feet water, these depressions being separated from each other by shallow bars. Eastward of the meridian named, the bottoms of the channels are everywhere above the level of low water, but they do not dryT entirely, though in no part is there sufficient water for even the smallest coasters to lie"], [510, "Cape d5antiFer to cape grisnez. [Chap. X. 488 afloat. In 1878, the average height of the bottoms of the channels above low water, springs, at Hourdel, Crotoy, and St. Valery, was 15 feet. When, as is usual, the two narrow channels just described unite and form one channel between Cayeux lighthouse and Hourdel point, it is from thence called the Somme channel, is generally about 2 cables wide, and follows the direction of the shore ; but when the junction takes place eastward of Hourdel point, as it did in 1878, the South Pass is the only one by which that port can be directly reached. Buoys. \u2014 The following buoys mark the approaches to the Somme : \u2014 An automatic whistle buoy is moored in about 44; fathoms, with Cayeux lighthouse bearing E. \\ N. 4^ miles. Two red bell buoys lie at the edge of the sands in from 16 to 20 feet water ; they are about 34 miles apart, and nearly on the line given at page 483 for clearing the sands, viz., the eastern extreme of Grange farm wood a quarter of a point open of the summit of Mers point cliff S.W. by S. The northern buoy is northward of the N.W. pass ; the southern buoy is northward of the South pass, 2 miles N.W. by W. \\ W. from Cayeux church tower and on the same bearing from Cayeux lighthouse as the whistle buoy. Two buoys with masts mark the entrance on either side to each Pass, and, from thence inwards, red and black buoys according to the French system (see page 9) mark the channels. Above Hourdel, the channels for Crotoy and St. Valery, respectively, are marked on the starboard hand by perches with rectangular vanes, and on the port hand by perches with skeleton balls. The buoys and perches marking the channels are liable to be shifted and the channels themselves to change, but the greatest care is taken to keep them in position. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Cayeux, at llh. 5m. ; springs rise 274^ feet, neaps 21 feet. At Hourdel, where the bottom is 11 feet above the low water level, ordinary springs rise from 20 to 21 feet, and neaps about 10 feet. At St. Valery, it is high water, full and change, at llh. 46m., and the tide rises at springs 17 or 18 feet above the bottom of the harbour, and at neaps about 8 feet. At Crotoy, the tide rises about 15 feet in the harbour at springs, and only 4 feet at neaps, with about a foot more in the entrance. In all these harbours, strong westerly winds raise the tides a foot or two and easterly winds have a contrary effect."], [511, "Chap. X.] RIVER SOMME.\u2014 BUOYS. \u2014 TIDES.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. 489 Tidal Streams. \u2014 At 3 hours flood, the stream in the Somme channel runs 6 or 7 knots, at springs ; but when the channel widens the stream in some degree loses strength. The greater part of the banks of shifting sand, near Hourdel point, do not cover until 2\\ hours flood. From this cause, and until this time, the rapid stream through the Somme channel continues to run north-eastward between these bankB and the eastern edge of the high bank barring the mouth of the Somme, and does not run eastward until joined by the stream which enters from the North-west, and by that flowing in along the edge of the beach on the northern shore of the estuary, by which time the banks are generally covered. The stream then follows the course of this northern beach until abreast of Crotoy, when the banks turn it south-eastward towards St. Valery. When the banks around Hourdel point are covered, the flood finds a passage along the southern shore of the estuary and its speed slackens considerably. The channel formed by the tide along this shore is sinuous, uneven, extremely variable, and, as a rule, not so deep as that leading to Crotoy, from which it is separated by shifting sands. Both these channels, as before stated, are well marked by perches and buoys, but neither should ever be attempted without a pilot. Pilots. \u2014 Pilotage is obligatory for vessels over 10 tons. Pilots are stationed at Cayeux, Crotoy, and St. Valery, and in moderate weather they cruise at sea. Those of Cayeux do not take vessels beyond Hourdel unless no pilot for St. Valery or Crotoy presents himself. Those of Crotoy only are allowed to take vessels to any port in the Somme. Two Steam-tugS are stationed in the Somme, and when not engaged are usually on the look-out for vessels outside the entrance channels. Directions. \u2014 No vessels off the mouth of the Somme should stand into less than 64^ fathoms, unless bound into the river : in which case, with westerly winds, and before there is sufficient water to pass through either of the outer channels, they should maintain a position on the meridian of Mers cliff, and south-westward of Cayeux church tower ; or, if the weather permits, they may anchor in about 1\\ fathoms, good holding ground, on the meridian of the cliff and W. by N. of Cayeux ; with off-shore winds, they may anchor a little westward of the large bell buoys moored outside the banks."], [512, "CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. 490 and no vessel should attempt to enter wdthout a pilot. The tide signals, see pages 484-5, make known when the narrows are practicable, and then, With a fair wind, a vessel may enter under sail ; or, with a foul wind, secure the aid of a steam-tug. It sometimes happens that the state of the sea does not admit of pilots going out to vessels requiring them, or to the assistance of those embayed off the mouth of the Somme and obliged to run in, which is always practicable towards high water, springs, when the signals can be seen and the position of the buoys at the entrance of the channels has been ascertained. To supply as far as possible the want of a pilot on board, a tall flagstaff, with the upper part working on a pivot, has been erected half a mile north-eastward of Cayeux lighthouse ; on this, a flag is hoisted and is inclined to the right or left as may be necessary to direct a vessel in the channels ; if she has entered and is steering a proper course, the flagstaff is kept in a vertical position, if not, it is drooped on the side towards which she should steer. These signals are made to vessels of all sizes when they have demanded a pilot. Vessels having entered, but finding themselves unable to reach either of the ports, should run aground under cover of one of the points or under the lee of a bank where they will be sheltered from the stream, for those grounding on the soft shifting sands in the strength of the stream are liable to be undermined by it and capsize. At night, pilots will not risk bringing vessels in, except it be moonlight or very clear and fine. HOURDEL.\u2014 When the Hable d'Ault, see page 484, was closed the bight within Hourdel point served as a refuge for the Cayeux fishing boats, but the constant increase of the sands threatening to fill it up, an artificial harbour was made to shelter coasting craft. It consists of a small tidal basin, from 270 to 325 yards long and 76 yards wide, and a Reservoir or Bassin de Chasses for clearing the entrance by sluicing. It will contain about 30 vessels well secured, but, except for the Cayeux fishery, its trade is entirely unimportant. As the direction of the entrance is athwart the tidal streams, which are very strong except just at high water, it is imprudent to attempt to enter without a pilot, who, if unable to board a vessel in the offing, can at all times do so after she has passed through the outer channels LIGHT.\u2014 A fixed white tidal light, of the fifth order, visible 6 miles, is shown from a mast on Hourdel point. It is lighted as soon as there are eighteen inches water in the harbour entrance and extinguished 3 hours after high water."], [513, "Chap. x.J HOURDEL. \u2014 ST. VALERY-SUR-SOMME. 491 Fog signal. \u2014 A bell is sounded every three seconds in foggy weather ; it commences to sound one hour before the flood, and con tinues to sound until three hours after high water (See note, page 10.) ST. VALERY-SUR-SOMME is 34, miles above Hourdel point, from which its entrance bears S.E. \\ S. Its tidal harbour is, properly speaking, the continuation of the Somme canal outside the lock. An earthern embankment, 1,100 yards long, which begins at the lock and terminates in an open stockade 70 yards long, shelters it from North to East, and a low dyke parallel with the shore preserves the channel between it and the shore as far as the lighthouse. On the West and South, it is bounded by the shore of La Ferte suburb, a part of which, 438 yrards long, has been converted into a quay, and along the shore as far as the lighthouse there is a towing path which was continued as a low dyke across the sands as far as Hourdel harbour, but has sunk beneath them. The population of St. Valery is about 4,000. It is the only commercial port of the Somme and by means of the Somme canal is connected with Abbeville and with the general canal system of France, and, by the branch railway to Noyelles, with the railway system. About 250 vessels, of an aggre gate of 50,000 tons, enter the port annually. The exports are chalk, vegetables, sand, and ballast ; and the imports, wood, coal, pig iron, &c. The harbour is quite sheltered from wind and sea, and can berth from 30 to 35 vessels alongside the quays ; they ground on a bottom of chalky mud mixed with sand and some shingle. A regular depth is maintained in the harbour by daily flushings from the canal. LIGHTS.\u2014 A fixed red light of the fifth order, 25 feet high, and visible 4 miles, is exhibited from an iron pole at the end of the towing path in front of St. Harold's tower, St. Valery. A. fixed green light, 25 feet above high water, and visible 4 miles, is exhibited from an iron pillar at the mole-head on the port hand in entering the harbour of St. Valery. Tides. \u2014 The tide begins to rise in the harbour about 3 hours after the commencement of the flood on Cayeux beach, and it fills in about 2^ hours ; at 4 hours ebb it is quite dry, see also page 488. Canal de la Somme, on the left or southern bank of the river, is 74; miles in length ; it commences at the village of Sur-Somme, 2 miles below Abbeville, and terminates at the head of St. Valery harbour in a lock, 656 feet long and 164 feet wide, in which vessels"], [514, "492 CAPE d'antifer TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. x. bound to or from Abbeville lie afloat. Horses are always in readiness to track vessels but with a fair wind they sometimes sail. The mean depth of water maintained in the canal is 7 ft. 9 in. above the sill of the lock, which is 16 feet above the level of the lowest tides, and 3 ft. 3 in. above the level of the grounding berths at the foot of the quay in the harbour. The water mayr be lowered to 64^ feet over the sill and raised to 18 feet ; a certain portion is passed through the flushing sluices daily. The maximum draught of vessels admitted into the canal is 11 feet. PORT d' ABBEVILLE, in the western part of the town of Abbeville, extends 600 yards along the right bank of the Somme, from the ramparts to the bridge which unites the Hocquet and the Marcadet quarters of the town. A quay extends the whole length of the port, and the railway is alongside the quay ; the river is sufficiently deep along the quay to admit of vessels drawing 11 feet remaining afloat. About 60 small vessels arrive at Abbeville by the canal yearly, their total tonnage being about 6,000 tons. The towm contains about 18,000 inhabitants, and though walled and formerly a place of some strength, is no longer classed as a fortress. Being on the railway line between Amiens and Boulogne it is in direct com munication with Paris. CROTOY. \u2014 The port consists of a natural creek sheltered from the sea by the little promontory on which the town of Crotoy stands. The harbour works comprise wooden pile work on the side of the town forming the quayT, and, on the other side, a reservoir or Bassin de Chasses for flushing and keeping open the channel ; at the head of the harbour, the Canal de Maie conducts the waters from the pond at Rue and the Favieres marshes into the Somme, and contributes to keep the entrance open. Crotoy occupies an advantageous position as relates to the circuitous course the flood stream takes in the mouth of the Somme during the time it has most strength ; it is equally accessible with the prevailing winds by either Pass, and the channel up to the entrance of Crotoy is almost always 3 feet deeper than either to Hourdel or St. Valery ; nevertheless, the construction of the Canal de la Somme, on the opposite shore, has entirely destroyed its trade, which, beyond the few fishing boats belonging to the harbour, is now represented by about a dozen vessels calling annually. LIGHT.\u2014 A fixed white tidal light, of the fifth order, visible 6 miles, is shown at 26 feet above high water from a post on the"], [515, "Chap, x.] 493 ABBEVILLE. \u2014 CROTOY. \u2014 SOMME BANKS. promontory of Crotoy.

BANCS de la SOMME.\u2014 The off-lying banks, generally called the Somme banks, are the Bassurelle de la Somme, the Quemer, the Battur, and the south-western part of the Bassure de Baas. Those dangerous banks lying in Dover strait, the Varne, Ridge or Colbart. Bassurelle, Ridins, and Vergoyer, are fully described in Channel Pilot, Part I. There is always sufficient water on the Somme banks to admit of vessels crossing them when bound for the mouth of the Somme. From the south-western end of the Bassure de Baas the land can be seen only in fine weather ; the eddies on the banks occasion a heavy sea when it blows hard, but the soundings on them differ sufficiently from those in the channels between to enable the mariner to know his position with reference to the banks and the land. The Quemer and the Bassurelle de la Somme appear to be extensions of that immense mass of sand and broken shells which forms the sub marine slope along the shore from St. Valery-en-Caux to the mouth of the river Canche. The Bassurelle de la Somme and the Quemer spread south-westward across the mouth of the Somme ; the Quemer ends about 10^ miles N.W. by W. \u00a3 W. and the Bassurelle de la Somme 10 miles W. by N. 4, N. from Cayeux lighthouse ; the channel separating them has no opening north-eastward, but terminates in the depth of 7 fathoms about 5 miles W.N.W. of St. Quentin point. Neither of these banks are dangerous, but they are joined to the shore by a shoal bottom on which the depth is less than 5 fathoms, and which extends nearly 5 miles into the offing. This shoal bottom terminates in two points projecting in the direction of each of the banks, the first b\"\\ miles W. f S. from St. Quentin point, the other 74; miles W. by S. 4 S. from Routhiauville point ; the latter is the most dangerous, as there are only 18 feet water 5 miles from the point on the same bearing. The Battur is in the channel separating the Quemer from the Bassure de Baas, and carries a depth of from 6 to 8 fathoms. It is not dangerous to vessels of any draught, but the eddies over it cause a heavy sea when it blows hard. From its south-western extreme, Cayeux lighthouse bears about S.E. f S. 13 miles; and, from its"], [516, "494 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ [Chap. X. north-eastern end, the lighthouse on Haut-Banc point S.E. by E. 6^ miles. The Bassure de Baas is a narrow bank of sand and shells, about 35 miles long from its northern end, which is 3i miles south-westward of cape Grisnez and H miles from the shore abreast of Audrecelles ; it follows nearly the direction of the coast as far as the mouth of the river Canche and then curves gradually westward, terminating about 17 miles from the shore a little southward of the parallel of the mouth of the river Authie, and 19 miles N.W. northerly from Cayreux lighthouse. From its northern end, as far as 5 miles southward of the Canche, it is dangerous to vessels of deep draught and, at low water, its highest parts may be touched by vessels of light draught when there is any sea on . The shoalest and most dangerous spot is a small flat, half a mile long N.N.E. and S.S.W., with only 12 feet on its southern part and 16 or 17 feet on its northern end, which lies nearly7 in the direction of the column of the Grande Armee, sometimes known as Buona parte's column, three quarters of a mile northward of Boulogne, on with Heurt fort bearing E.N.E. ; and, from it, that fort bears N.E. by E. | E. ; cape Alprech lighthouse E. \\ N. ; Gravois windmill E. by S. \\ S. ; and, the summit of Mont St. Frieux S. by E. f E. ; the sea breaks with great violence on the whole of the flat during strong westerly winds. For 14 miles southward of this flat, as far as W. 4 S. 8 miles from Touquet point, the shoalest parts of the Bassure de Baas form a succession of long narrow flats where the depths vary from 18 to 26 feet, and where the sea breaks heavily when it blows hard from the westward. There are no dangers in the channel between the bank and the shore, but, with a strong breeze on a weather tide, a high sea runs on some shoal spots of from 54, to 8 fathoms lying nearly in the middle of that channel. During bad weather, with winds between West and N.N.W., the sea is less disturbed in this channel than out side the Bassure de Baas, especially from abreast of the mouth of the Canche northward to cape Alprech. Directions. \u2014 As the eastern side of the Bassure de Baas is steep to, the lead is an uncertain guide for avoiding the 12-feet patch on its northern part when running through the channel between the bank and the shore ; but, by steering with Creche point opening and shutting in with Heurt fort, a vessel keeps in mid-channel when between the parallels of Gravois windmill and the guard-house on the hills a quarter of a mile northward of Brone rivulet."], [517, "Chap. X.] SOMME BANKS. \u2014 ESTUARY OF THE AUTHIE. 495 Great attention should be paid to the lead when approaching the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the Vergoyer from the northward, for the northern part of the latter presents a steep pro jecting point approaching the French coast at the outer edge of the 20-fathoms line of soundings. A vessel running from the southward through this channel, which is 5 miles wide and carries a depth of from 14 to 23 fathoms, avoids the Vergoyer by keeping in from 15 to 16 fathoms throughout the whole length of the channel. THE COAST.\u2014 From St. Quentin point, the coast, which is low and bordered by ranges of sand-hills, trends NN,E.}E.4| miles to Routhiauville point, at the southern side of the mouth of the river Authie, and the only objects rising above the sand-hills and visible in clear weather are, the tall spire of St. Quentin church and the wind mill at Royons. The intermediate shore is fronted by a strand which dries 1^ miles south- westward from St. Quentin point, and West 14 miles from Routhiauville point ; between these points it dries out generally only half a mile. Caution. \u2014 Great caution is necessary to avoid being caught on this part of the coast by strong westerly winds, for they cause a high sea over the shoal bottom extending 5 miles from the shore and increase the speed of the flood, which in calm weather runs 3 knots. The same winds also decrease the rate of the ebb, and no dependence can be placed on the strength of this stream to assist a vessel in clawing off the coast. The ESTUARY Of the AUTHIE is comprised between point Routhiauville and Haut-Banc or Berck point, which bear N. by E. and S. by W. 24^ miles from each other, and extends eastward 2\\ miles to its head, where it is about 3 cables wide with the river Authie flowing into it from the southward. The entrance is filled with an enormous accumulation of sand and broken shells which dries at half tide, and, at low water, springs, uncovers 14^ miles westward of the meridian of Haut-Banc point . Routhiauville point is covered with sand-hills, and the only remarkable object near it is a guard house standing amongst the highest hills about 2 cables southward of the point. A sand-bank, barely covered at high water, neaps, joins this point and extends in a circuit of more than a mile between the bearings N.N.W. and N.E. from the guard-house. A similar bank surrounds Haut-Banc point and projects a mile between the bearings W.S.W. and S.S.E. from the point."], [518, "496 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. The channel into the Authie is principally kept open by the flood stream which sets in with great rapidity until the banks are covered. The 'entrance is between the banks just described, and the channel varies in position by the shifting of the banks and is sometimes divided into two passes ; it runs in an easterly direction from the outer edge of the sands and terminates in a narrow trench along side a low rough stone dyke, constructed in order to turn the ebb stream away from the northern bank and thus put a stop to the erosion of that bank and of Haut-Banc point. Fishermen haul their boats up here and the channel is marked by little red and black buoys, but the changes are so frequent that it is quite possible the channel may eventually fill up altogether. The bottom of the grounding places and the higher parts of the channel are 15 or 16 feet above the low water level. The banks of the Authie have undergone great changes of late years, the tendency of the estuary being to move bodily northward. Between 1835 and 1878, Routhiauville point advanced about 550 yards northward and Haut-Banc point receded about 450 yards in the same direction. The dyke referred to is of modern construction and, with other works for the protection of the northern shore, seemed, in 1882, to be fairly answering its purpose. Haut-Banc or Berck point may be easily recognised by day by its circular white lighthouse and guard-house standing near it on the sand-hills, which are sufficiently high to be seen in clear weather 7 or 8 miles distant. LIGHT.\u2014 Berck lighthouse exhibits, at 115 feet above high water, an occulting ivhite light, the eclipses taking place every five seconds ; the light is visible from a distance of 17 miles ; it is obscured when bearing S. \\ W. through an angle of 20', by the clock of the Hospital. The hospital is a very large building, close to the shore, erected by the municipality of Paris for the treatment of invalid children. A Life-Boat is stationed near the lighthouse, and there is also a life-saving mortar apparatus. Directions.\u2014 The mouth of the river Authie is dangerous to approach during the flood, especially with westerly winds, on account of the stream which then runs into it with great rapidity and might draw a vessel on the banks where she would become a total wreck, the buoys for the use of the -small fishing vessels of about 5 feet"], [519, "Chap. X.] ESTUARIES OF THE RIVERS AUTHIE AND CANCHE. 497 draught belonging to Grofniers not being sufficient guides for a stranger to enter the channel. No vessel, indeed, however small her draught, should ever attempt the entrance, unless in charge of one of the fishermen of Berck or of Groffliers, who alone are in a position to know the changes taking place in the channel. The COAST from Haut-Banc point trends N.N.E. \\ E. 8 miles to Touquet point at the entrance of the river Canche. The shore is low, sandy, and bordered by a range of sand-hills of moderate height. A sandy strand half a mile wide uncovers at the foot of the sand-hills, and joins the accumulation of sand which obstructs the entrances of the rivers Authie and Canche. The low plain adjoining the shore extends to the foot of the hills 3 or 4 miles inland and is divided in its whole length into two nearly equal parts by a chain of sand-hills, much higher than those near the beach, and which may be seen 8 or 9 miles distant. This chain of hills may be mistaken for those bordering the beach, although they are 14 or 2 miles inland, and it is important to guard against this mistake when turning to windward in-shore in hazy weather. The objects which serve as distinguishing marks on this part of the coast are, the windmills of Verton and St. Jossee, on the hills in the interior ; the chain of sand-hills just described ; the lighthouses on Haut-Banc and Touquet points ; the five guard-houses standing at nearly equal distances on the sand-hills along the coast ; and, the hospital, church tower, and windmills at Berck-sur-mer. This church tower stands on the plain E. by N. 1\\ miles from Haut-Banc point, and is an excellent landmark ; at a distance it resembles a large sloop under sail. The inhabitants of Berck, Cuque, and Merlimont, fit out about fifty fishing boats of from 2 to 9 tons burden, which they ground at high water on the beach just northward of Haut-Banc point. The ESTUARY Of the CANCHE, known locally as the bay of Etaples, is 2 miles wide between Touquet and Lornel points, the northern and southern limits of the entrance, and runs 3 miles inland in a S.S.E. direction. Like the estuaries of the Somme and the Authie, it is filled up by a mass of sand and broken shells which is left dry at half ebb and uncovers at low water 14, miles outside the entrance, and, like the Authie estuary, inclines to move bodily northward and also to become narrower, Touquet point having extended northward 330 yards since 1835, and Lomel point having receded about 200 yards in the same period. The entrance points and A. 2771. Wt. 2742. 2 I"], [520, "[Chap. X. 498 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. shores of the river consist of sand-hills of moderate height, of which the shapes are frequently changed by westerly gales. ETAPLES.\u2014 From Touquet point, the southern shore of the estuary trends S.E. by S. as far as abreast of the small port of Etaples, which, though in ancient times a place of considerable importance, has now nothing but its rather extensive fishery, its general trade having been entirely destroyed by the silting up of the bay, which now only admits vessels of 9 feet draught, at springs, as far as Etaples, where the grounding berths are muddy sand, and are on the north western side of the town where there is a wooden quay and piles for mooring vessels. The northern shore is low and winding ; between Etaples, which stands on the northern bank of the river, and Lornel point, its general trend is N.N.W. and the two shores converge towards each other, the river, abreast of the town, being only a quarter of a mile wide. The surf and westerly winds heap up the sand round Touquet point, where it forms a bank barely covered at high water, neaps, and extending in a circuit of nearly a mile between the bearings N.N.W. and N.N.E. from the point. This bank shelters the inner part of the bay, and fishing craft unable to reach Etaples in one tide lie aground in the channel in safety^ under its lee. About this part, and just before reaching the outer end of the dyke presently described, the bottom of the channel rises to 13 feet above the level of low water, and from thence to Etaples it is from that to 16 feet above that level. A similar bank to that round Touquet point lies in front of Lornel point and extends nearly a mile in a W.S.W. direction ; between these banks is the entrance channel into the river. The streams of flood and ebb are both very rapid through the channel so long as the banks are uncovered, but their rate does not exceed 3 knots during the last hour of the flood and the first hour of the ebb. With westerly gales, the sea is high at the entrance, and the waves caused by a strong south-westerly wind cross it obliquely. The Entrance Channel runs between the banks, as described, in an easterly direction towards the Camiers lighthouses on the northern shore of the river ; from thence, it follows the northern shore, at a short distance, up to Etaples. Above and within point Touquet, the channel has in recent years been saved from entire destruction by the building of the submersible dyke of rough chalk stones, before referred to, nearly 2 miles in length up to and abreast of Etaples, where its end is connected with the southern shore, thus forming"], [521, "Chap, x.] ETAPLES. \u2014 TOUQUET POINT LIGHTS. 499 the channel, about 70 yards wide, on its northern side between the town quays and the dyke. On the side of the town a similar dyke is partially constructed with the object of still further restricting and deepening the channel. Half a mile above Etaples the viaduct of the Northern railway crosses the river. By means of this line the town is in direct com munication with Boulogne on the North, and also with Amiens and Paris. Pilots. \u2014 Two pilots and an assistant pilot are stationed at Etaples. When they are unable to get out to a vessel, they come as far as the weather permits and signal the direction to be taken by hand. The smallest vessel, without local knowledge, should not think of attempt ing this channel without a pilot. Buoys. \u2014 The entrance channel into the Canche is marked by two large buoys, viz. : a black buoy on its northern side and a red bell buoy on its southern side, from thence the channel up to Etaples is well marked by red and black buoys as far as the dyke, which is marked by black poles and white buoys, a large red buoy being moored on the northern side half a mile below Etaples quay. The positions of the buoys are frequently changed to suit the variations in the channel. LIGHTS.\u2014 Touquet point.\u2014 Two octagonal lighthouses, 273 yards apart, bearing N. by E. \\ E. and S. by W. 4 W. from eacn other, stand on Touquet point ; each exhibits a fixed white electric light at 174 feet above high water, and visible in clear weather 20 miles. Camiers. \u2014 Two lights are also shown from lighthouses erected on the sand-hills of Camiers. The upper lighthouse is of iron, and painted white ; it exhibits at 121 feet above high water a fixed white light, visible 9 miles in clear weather. The lower light is shown from a white square stone tower which exhibits at 54 feet above high water a fixed red light visible 9 miles. It bears W. \u00a3 S. 798 yards from the upper light and is only visible within an arc of 16\u00b0 on either side of the line of bearing ; it is only lighted when there are less than 6| feet water in the channel . Note. \u2014 The lights at Camiers wei*e originally established as lead ing lights for the channel. The constant movement of the channel northward has quite thrown them out of that line, but they are still maintained as they afford useful indications to the fishermen ; on no account, however, should they be taken, either by day or night, as affording a leading mark for the entrance. 212"], [522, "[Chap. X. 500 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on Touquet Point, 440 yards northward of the Northern lighthouse. Directions. \u2014 At night, the heavy sea and sand-banks at the mouth of the river Canche may be avoided by keeping cape Grisnez light well open westward of cape Alprech light. By day, the extreme of cape Grisnez should be kept about half a point open westward of cape Alprech. Though vessels should never attempt to enter the mouth of the Canche without a pilot or some person of local experience, they may be driven to do so by bad weather, or by finding themselves embayed amongst the sand-banks. The pilots reside at Etaples, and as it is impossible for them to board vessels outside when it blows hard from the westward, they then meet them under shelter of the bank joining Touquet point. Vessels without pilots, seeking shelter, should endeavour as soon as possible to get sight of the outer red bell buoy, and it is important not to pass northward of the parallel of Touquet point before it is sighted, for, if set too far northward by the flood stream, which is running at its greatest strength outside the banks at the time of high water at Etaples, it is impossible to regain the entrance. The most favourable time for entering the Canche is about one hour before high water, for the stream then runs into the channel with sufficient strength to assist a vessel in threading her way, and the water still rises enough to float her should she take the ground. Pass between the black and red buoys, leaving the black to port and the red to starboard, as usual. At springs, pilots place vessels drawing 10 or 11 feet water, when not bound to or unable to reach Etaples, in the elbow above Touquet point ; here they lie in safety even during westerly gales, protected by the high bank which joins Touquet point, and which dries from 21 to 23 feet above the level of the lowest tides. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in the mouth of the Canche at 11 h. 20 m. ; the tide rises in the entrance channel, where the bottom is about 3 feet above the low water level, 29 feet at high water, springs, and 23 feet at neaps ; at the outer end of the dyke north-eastward of Touquet point, where the bottom is 13 feet above the level of the lowest tides, 16 feet at ordinary springs, and 10 feet at neaps. At Etaples quay, springs rise 114. feet, and neaps about 6 feet above the surface of the grounding berths which dry 16 or 17 feet above the low water level. The flood stream does not check the"], [523, "Chap. X.] RIVER CANCHE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 CAUTION. 501 current of the Canche until about 3 hours after the tide has begun to rise on the outer edge of the sand-banks at the entrance ; it rises in front of Etaples 14^ hours before high water and falls for about 3 hours afterwards. Caution. \u2014 The slight elevation of the land, as well as the dangers bordering the shore, render the navigation of the coast for the 25 miles from Cayeux to the mouth of the Canche, extremely dangerous in foggy or snowy weather, or during strong westerly gales ac companied by rain, when the weather is generally dark, the land covered with mist, and the most brilliant lights difficult to distinguish. Moreover, with these gales, a few hours suffice to raise a heavy sea in the eastern part of the Channel, and especially on the edge of the great submarine slope which extends off-shore from St. Valery-en- Caux to the river Canche, and this alone causes a considerable drift ; but, in addition, westerly gales tend to drive the water towards the head of the bight formed between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez, and greatly7 influence the direction of the tidal streams, see page 515. It may be seen, therefore, how important it is that a vessel should not run into the eastern part of the Channel without her position being well ascertained by bearings of cape Barfleur light, or of St. Catherine's light, Isle of Wight, and without using every precaution after these lights are lost sight of. The only safeguard is the frequent use of the lead ; and, if lights cannot be distinguished or the position is from any cause doubtful, vessels should keep in at least 20 fathoms water whatever be the time of tide ; this not only keeps a vessel clear of the dangers near the shore, but also of the off-lying banks between the mouth of the Somme and Dover channel. The COAST from Lornel point trends N. by E. 4. E. 84, miles to cape Alprech, and from thence N. E. f E. 2 miles to Boulogne. The shore is low, bordered by sand-hills of moderate height, and runs in a straight line from the mouth of the Canche to that of the Brone rivulet, which finds its way into the sea 2 miles southward of cape Alprech, and is the northern limit of the low sandy shore forming the coast-line for the whole distance of 34 miles from the town of Ault, near Treport, A mile northward of the rivulet the coast is low with hills sloping down towards it, and, on their sides, several houses of the village of Equihen may be seen ; beyond this, the coast is steep, and is formed of clay and of schistose rocks of a dark grey colour."], [524, "CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. 502 The high land separating the courses of the rivers Canche and Liane, which latter runs into the sea at Boulogne, extends westward to within 1^ miles of the coast and terminates near the meridian of Etaples in a chain of hills, of which many are sufficiently high to be seen in clear weather 25 miles distant. These hills are excellent landmarks for the pilots on this coast, who call them the terres de Tourmont or Tourmont-land, and on the highest of them are Faux and Houlette windmills, which are visible at a great distance ; the former stands 24; miles north-eastward, and the latter 34; miles N.N.E., of Etaples. At 1\u00a3 miles from the coast and 2\\ miles northward of Houlette mill, in front of the Tourmont-land, is Mont St. Frieux, one of the most remarkable objects between the river Canche and Boulogne. It consists of four mounds or hillocks, veryT near each other, rising from the same base and occupying a space of 1\\ miles North and South ; from its isolated position, as well as from the height of the hillocks, it may be seen in clear weather at the same distance as the Tourmont-land. On the highest of the hills northward of Brone rivulet is the church of St. Etienne-au-Mont and the windmills of Gravois, Alprech, Portel, and Outreau, all of which may be seen a considerable distance at sea. The sandy beach, which extends the whole length of this part of the coast almost to cape Alprech, uncovers at low water half a mile out from the foot of the sand-hills, but northward of Brone rivulet the shore is bordered byr a shelf of irregular rocks which dry a cable outside high- water mark. CAPE ALPRECH is a perpendicular rocky cliff of a brownish red colour, 135 feet above the level of high- water ; the foot of the cliff is skirted by a shelf of rock covered with boulders which dries a cable out at low water. From the cape, the coast turns sharply north-eastward, and is high and steep-to within 4 cables of the jetties of Boulogne.* LIGHTS.\u2014 A square lighthouse, 33 feet high, stands on the summit of cape Alprech about 87 yards from the edge of the cliff, near the tower of the old semaphore, and 2\\ miles south- west ward from the entrance to Boulogne. It exhibits, at 161 feet above high water, a fixed ivhite light, varied every two minutes by a red flash, which flash is preceded and followed by a short eclipse. It is dioptric, of the fifth order, and visible in clear weather from a distance of 12 miles. * See Admiralty Chart :\u2014 Dungeness to the Thames, including Dover Strait, No. 1895 ; scale, \u2022\u00bb;=0,68 of an inch."], [525, "Chap.

The two lights in line lead 24. cables seaward of the outer part of the new South-west mole of Boulogne, in course of construction and near completion. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on cape Alprech just southward of the lighthouse. PORTEL. \u2014 The coast between cape Alprech and Boulogne is intersected by valleys, and at the entrance of the largest is the village of Portel. This valley, 6 cables N.E. by E. of the cape, is enclosed by high land and on the summit of the hill on its northern side stands the fortress of Mont Couppes, in the interior of which is a semaphore. The rocks which uncover at low water, extend 4 cables off-shore from Portel, and, on their summit, N. \u00a3 E. about 7 cables from cape Alprech lighthouse, is the small fort of Heurt. The Lineur sunken rocks project N.N.W. 24, cables from the fort and a heavy sea runs on them with a fresh south-westerly wind. The fishermen of Portel have about 40 boats ; during the fine season, they ground them on the south-western side of a small beach in front of the village where they are sheltered during the greater part of the tide by the surrounding rocks. When the weather is threatening, they haul them above high-water mark and place them in the bed of a small rivulet which runs through the valley ; in winter they take shelter in Boulogne harbour. BOULOGNE.* \u2014 This port, occupying the entrance of the valley of the Liane, is undergoing such vast alterations that any description of it can be applicable to the present time only. The projected new port, with the works actually in progress and energetically carried on, are on such a scale as, if ever completed, to entirely alter the character of the port. The intention is to enclose about 340 acres of water space, of which a great portion is to be available for ships of the deepest draught at all times of tide. With this object, a stone pier of the strongest and most solid construction, starting from the shore under the Chatillon cliff, a mile south-westward of the present harbour entrance, has been run out 1,690 yTards in a N.N.W. \\ W. direction ; it then curves for 218 yards farther until its direction becomes N.E. by N., from whence it is carried in that direction a farther distance of about 600 yards. The whole extent of this magnificent work, without a break, is 2,344 yards ; and, of this length, the last 600 yards alone remain to be completed ; this * See Admiralty Plan of Boulogne, No. 438, m = 49 inches."], [526, "504 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. latter portion is (1888) above the level of low water and has a small lighthouse, constructed of masonry and surmounted by an iron column 15 feet high, at its extreme. An experimental light, presently described, was first exhibited from this lighthouse in August, 1888. The remainder of the project has not yet been commenced and is for the present in abeyance ; it consists in extending the East pier of the present harbour, now7 646 yards long, a farther distance of 1,570 yards seaward, where its head will be in about 4\u00a3 fathoms and will bear about N.E. \\ N. 1,050 yards from the head of the new West pier. This intervening space will be partly occupied by a breakwater 544 yards in length, leaving an opening at its western end, 272 yards wide, into the new harbour ; and, at its eastern end, an entrance into the old harbour between it and the prolonged East pier. Sheltered by the completed portion of the new West pier, extensive works for the accommodation of shipping are in progress along the shore between it and the present harbour. Buoys.* \u2014 The following buoys mark the works in progress : \u2014 1. A red bell buoy with reflector is moored in about 7 fathoms water, 14 cables W.S.W. from the curve at the elbow of the new West pier. 2. A red buoy with staff and globe lies about 14 cables W. | N. from the northern end of the outer part of the same pier now under construction and above the level of low water. Vessels from the south- west ward must pass outside these buoys. The port of Boulogne as at present constituted is formed entirely at the mouth of the Liane, a small river whose waters are abundant during rainy seasons or at the melting of the snow ; it admits vessels of about 26 feet draught at ordinary springs, when the sea is smooth, and of about 22 feet at neaps. The principal objects recognised when approaching Boulogne are, Mont St. Frieux, already described, see page 502, Mont Lambert H miles to the eastward, the highest land in the neighbourhood of Boulogne, and the column of the Grande Armee on the high land a mile northward of the town. The entrance to the harbour bears N.W. \u00a3 W. from the summit of Mont Lambert, and W. \u00a3 S. from the column ; the former is 589 feet, and the head of the statue on the column 448 feet above the level of the sea. * In addition to the two buoys here described, the French Government gave notice that on the 1st April, 1887, an experimental red automatic whistle buoy was moored a quarter of a cable westward of the bell buoy with reflector."], [527, "Chap. X.] 505 BOULOGNE. \u2014 BUOYS. \u2014 ENTRANCE. The town stands chiefly on the eastern side of the harbour, and is built in the form of an amphitheatre in and on the sides of a small valley enclosed between high hills. The buildings most easily recognised from the sea are the bell-tower and cupola of the new cathedral in the upper town, the church spire in the lower town, the marine baths, the windmill half way up the hill south-eastward of the baths, and the church of St. Pierre des Marins on the cliff. Entrance Channel.\u2014 The two piers enclosing the channel into the harbour are of unequal length and run out across a sandy strand which uncovers half a mile from the shore at the lowest tides. The piers are 230 feet apart, and, from the entrance, which has a S.E. by S. direction, curve slightly eastward. The sand formerly spread itself at times across the entrance, forming a bar rising higher than the bottom of the channel, but the depths have been greatly improved since 1882 by dredging and scouring, the object being to render it deep enough for the Folkestone steamers to enter at low water. This object has in fact been effected, and, since April 1885, the daily service of steamers has been at fixed times instead of tidal as formerly. The South-west pier is 735 yards long and consists of a stone foundation on which is wooden pile-work filled in and planked up to high- water mark, which shelters the channel from the high sea during south-westerly gales. The North-east pier, 547 yards long, curves and lies parallel with the South-west pier, and also consists of a stone foundation surmounted by open pile-work. In order that the scouring water may follow the course of the channel beyond the South-west pier-head, a low submersible dyke 500 yards long, composed of rough stonework for 150 yards and continued in strong pile-work the remainder of its length, has been extended from the North-east pier-head. The position of this dyke, of which the top is from 3 to 9 feet above the level of low water, is marked, by day, by a mast surmounted by a ball at the North-east pier-head being on with the lighthouse 33 yards within that pier-head. By night, the mast bears a fixed green light, and the two lights in line indicate its position. Sailing vessels should not attempt the entrance channel during heavy westerly gales, and even steamers run great risk : but it should be always borne in mind that when Boulogne is impracticable on account of the weather, Calais can be entered, and vice versa. Harbour. \u2014 The harbour consists of the Tidal harbour or Import dock, with an inner port and reservoir or Retenue de Chasses at its head, and a Wet dock or Basin. The North-east pier joins the quays of Boulogne tidal harbour or import dock, which is 3\u00a3 cables long and"], [528, "506 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. one cable wide, and along the quays on this side are berthed the Thames steamers, and are the landing-places for the goods traffic of the South-Eastern Railway. The bottom at the foot of this quay rises at parts as much as 6^ feet above the level of the lowest tides, and is hard and unfit for sharp laden vessels to ground on for more than a few days, considerable swell being felt here with strong westerly winds. At high water, neaps, those drawing from 12 to 13 feet can come alongside ; vessels of deeper draught lie aground there for four or five days. There are other berths in the Tidal harbour on the western side between the inner end of the South-west pier and the Basin ; and, at the northern end of the Quai Chanzy, which separates the Import dock from the Basin, is the railway station and the landing stage for the Folkstone steamers, alongside of which are from 9 to 12 feet at low water. There is also a slip-way for building or repairing small vessels, and a gridiron and careening place adjoining the slip. The Basin or wet dock is on the western side of the Import dock, and its entrance is through a lock at its northern end. The Basin has an area of 17 acres with a quay frontage of 1,150 yards. The lock has double gates, is 69 feet wide between them, and 328^ feet in length ; the depth over the sills is 29 feet at springs, and 23 feet at neaps. The Basin itself has about 18 inches more water, but the bottom is hard and only lightly coated with mud. Coals can be obtained in moderate quantities at about 16s. per ton. Vessels coal without difficulty either in the Tidal harbour or in the Basin. Slight repairs to machinery can be effected, but, there being no dry dock, serious defects of hull cannot be made good. Stores and supplies generally are cheap and plentiful. Trade, &C\u2014 The general trade of the port is extensive. In 1886 the number of vessels entering was 1,986, of an aggregate of 491,248 tons. The principal imports are coal, cast iron, iron ore, steel, wool, machinery, timber, beer, flax and tow, cotton, &c. ; the exports, wine, spirits, cement, grain, fruit and vegetables, Parisian articles, &c. &c. The herring and mackerel fisheries employ a considerable capital and several vessels are fitted out for the Iceland cod fishery. The coasting trade is active ; there is daily communication by steamer with Folkstone, thus connecting the South-eastern Railway of England with the Northern Railway of France, and several times a week with London and Goole. The population of the town in 1886 was 45,916, of whom about one fifth were English. There is a small British Seaman's Institute with recreation and reading rooms."], [529, "Chap. X.] 507 BOULOGNE.\u2014 TRADE.\u2014 LIGHTS. LIGHTS. \u2014 The following lights mark the new West Pier and the entrance to Boulogne harbour : \u2014 New West Pier.\u2014 In August, 1888, from the lighthouse near the extreme of this pier, and 115 feet bevond the extreme of the part then submerged at high water, an experimental light was exhibited at 42 feet above the sea. The light is quick flashing, of the fifth order, is fed by compressed oil gas, and is visible 8 miles. South-west Pier.\u2014 Tide Lights.\u2014 From a round tower at the pier-head are shown two vertical fixed ivhite lights of the fourth order, visible 11 miles ; the upper light is 43 feet, the lower light 33 feet, above the level of high water, springs. The upper light is exhibited as soon as there are 9\u00a3 feet water in the entrance channel ; the lower light, at high water ; both lights are extinguished when the water falls to 9\u00a3 feet. From an iron support, 47 yards within the vertical lights and 29 feet above the sea, is shown a fixed red light, visible about 4 miles. This light is obscured by the tidal lighthouse through an arc of 4\u00b0 20' when bearing between S.S.E. and S.S.E. 4 E. North-east Pier. \u2014 A fixed red light, dioptric and of the fourth order, is exhibited from a white tower 33 yards from the North-east pier-head ; it is 46 feet above the sea and visible 8 miles. A fixed green light is exhibited at an elevation of 33 feet, from the mast on the North-east pier-head from which, during the day, a ball is exhibited ; it stands about 30 yards in advance of the lighthouse. The green and red lights in line, as before stated, show the direction of the low submersible dyke extending from the North-east pier-head. The South-west pier red light on with the North-east pier red light E. by S. 4; S. leads northward of the works in progress at the outer end of the new West pier. Vessels making the harbour should keep northward of this line. Fog Signals. \u2014 Two sirens are sounded together on the South west pier-head, as follows : \u2014 one siren gives a continuous sound, the other of greater power gives a group of two sounds (low, high), about every 50 seconds ; each sound is of about 2h seconds duration, and the two sounds of each group are separated by an interval of 4 seconds. Should the sirens be damaged, a bell is sounded about 50 times a minute. During foggy weather, and so long as there are 61 feet or more water in the entrance channel, a bell is sounded 60 times a minute from the light-keeper's house at the South-west pier-head. (See note, page 10.)"], [530, "508 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual day tide signals, see page 8, are made from a signal-staff at the South-west pier-head, commencing from a depth of &\\ feet. When the sluices of the scouring waters are going to be opened a blue flag is hoisted at the tide signal flag-staff, and also at a staff near the sluice gates. Other signals are made from a mast at the inner end of the North east pier. A blue triangle indicates a ship approaching ; a red triangle by day, or a red light by night, signals the approach of one of the regular packets. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in the port of Boulogne at llh. 25., springs rise 284^ feet, neaps 23 feet above the level of the soundings on the chart, which are those of low water, equinoctial springs. Strong westerly winds raise the tide a foot or two higher, and those from the eastward have a contrary effect. Sometimes it may be necessary to cross a temporary bar at the entrance, and an allowance should be made for the 'scend of the sea, which runs high at the entrance with fresh westerly winds. The tide is slack at high water, springs, for about 20 minutes with westerly, and 15 minutes with easterly winds, and vessels can be moved in the harbour during one hour and a half ; at neaps, the slack continues about 40 minutes. Tidal Streams. \u2014 At 3 miles westward of Boulogne, outside the Bassure de Baas, the flood or north-eastern stream begins to acquire its greatest strength at the time of high water in the harbour, main tains it for about 2 hours, and ceases at 3\u00a3 hours after high water. At a short distance outside the pier-heads, its greatest strength is at the time of high water in the harbour, and it ceases at 2\u00a3 hours afterwards. The eddies on the flood, occasioned by the great pro jection of the South-west pier from the shore, are very strong as soon as the sands are covered. These eddies extend into the bay northward of the North-east pier, and about the time of high water in the harbour they form a counter stream running north-westward along the eastern face of that pier ; this eddy stream, as previously described, after rounding the pier-head, divides, one part entering the channel, the other crossing it rapidly towards the South-west pier-head.* Steam-tugS. \u2014 The services of steam-tugs may always be obtained when required. * As early as 1882 the pilots reported that the building of the new West pier was affecting the action of the tides at the entrance of the harbour, the rate of the flood, and consequently of the eddy on the flood near the pier-heads, having become perceptibly reduced. It is probable that as the works extend, further modifications will follow."], [531, "Chap, x.] BOULOGNE ROADS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 509 Pilots. \u2014 Eight pilots and three assistant pilots are stationed at Boulogne ; they cruise at sea in good decked boats, but if they are unable to get to sea in bad weather, either a pilot or the lighthouse keeper, from the top of the lighthouse on the South-west pier, directs vessels entering as to the course to be steered by waving his hat, Should there be several vessels running for the harbour, the signal is for the vessel nearest the entrance. If the sea is too heavy to enter the channel, vessels should bear up at once for Calais ; for, as before stated, when Boulogne harbour is impracticable on account of the high sea, that of Calais can be entered, and the contrary. Life-Boats. \u2014 There are three life-boats stationed at Boulogne ; one is near the centre of the North-east pier ; the second, northward of that pier on the beach, near the baths ; the third, southward of the harbour, at the end of the Chatillon sand-hills. BOULOGNE ROADS. \u2014 Good anchorage may be found in about 4\u00a3 fathoms, 8 cables outside the pier-heads, on a narrow strip of hard clay about 7 cables long North and South, and a cable wide. It is the very space which will be occupied by the breakwater of the new harbour, should that work ever be proceeded with. This bottom is bounded on its western side by the rocky bottom known as Vhuitriere or the oyster bed, which begins at cape Alprech and extends without interruption northward as far as the parallel of Ambleteuse. The best anchorage is between the lines of the colonnade of the new cathedral on with the guard-house of Chatillon battery, which stands on the sand-hills a little southward of the South-west pier ; and, the fort on Mont Lambert on with the belfry tower in the upper town, the small fort at Ambleteuse bearing about N.E. by N. Vessels of moderate draught waiting to enter Boulogne may remain at this anchorage during fine weather, and, with a long scope of cable out, even if caught there by a strong westerly wind ; those of deep draught, however, would be in danger of striking the bottom when tailing in-shore at low water. Vessels arriving off the harbour some time before high water may anchor well to the southward off the elbow of the new West pier, and outside the line of the buoys, in 8 or 9 fathoms. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 From the \"Westward. \u2014 Vessels approaching Boulogne from the westward, with the wind between South and West, should take the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the Vergoyer banks, and if they arrive on the parallel of Mont St. Frieux at low water, short tacks should be made in the Channel between"], [532, "510 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. that parallel and the line of the column of the Grande Armee on with the lighthouse on the South-west pier-head. With the wind between South and East, the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the shore should be taken, and short boards made southward of the line of the column and lighthouse in one until the tide has risen sufficiently to enter the harbour ; or, weather permitting, they may anchor in Boulogne roads. Vessels of the deepest draught may at all times cross over the Bassure de Baas in front of Boulogne. One of the deepest parts is with the column of the Grande Armee on with the lighthouse on the South-west pier bearing E. \u00a3 N. ; but, as the harbour is neared, it must be borne in mind that this line leads directly for the elbow of the new West pier ; therefore, having crossed the Bassure de Baas, a vessel should keep to the northward until the red lights on the North-east and South-west piers are in line, which line leads north ward of the outermost works in progress and of the lighthouse at the extreme of the new West pier. From the Northward. \u2014 With the wind between North and West, vessels from the northward should pass westward of the Bassure de Baas, and, if the wind is fresh, they should wait outside this bank until the time for entering ; but, with a light wind, the bank should be crossed on the parallel of Creche fort and a position be maintained a short distance to windward of the entrance. If the wind is between North and East, it is better to take the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the land and then anchor, if the weather permits, in such a position as to have the wind a point or two free for running into port. The high land in the vicinity of Boulogne modifies the direction of the wind in the harbour, and sometimes when it is S.S.W. outside it is South or S.S.E. within. Strong winds from the N.E. come off in violent squalls from the high land northward of the harbour. Sailing vessels should endeavour to enter during the last hour of the flood, which assists their being tracked in, and a tracking crew will be always found on the piers. With a fresh leading wind, they may be able to stem the first hour of the ebb, and even the freshets of the river Liane, and get up to the berths in the harbour ; but, whatever the strength and direction of the wind, plenty of sail should be carried on entering the channel in order to stem the eddy between the pier-heads, which is at its greatest strength about the time of high water in the harbour.

Generally speak ing, when the wind is from West round by South to N.E., steer close to the South-west pier-head ; with a fresh breeze from anywhere between N.E. and West keep in mid-channel ; and, in light winds, procure a steam-tug, or steer for the South-west pier to take in the tracking rope. Should a vessel miss the entrance during strong westerly winds and be unable to claw off the land, she should endeavour to pass close round the northern side of the North-east pier and run ashore under its lee. If this occurs at half or three quarters of an hour after high water, there is some chance of getting her afloat again, and at all events the crew are safe. Steam-vessels, or those in tow, will find the deepest water in entering by keeping near the submerged dyke projecting from the North-east pier-head, which they may do by keeping the light house on that pier a little open westward of the mast with a ball at the pier-head. Vessels leaving the port for the northward should do so as soon as they are afloat, and with a favourable wind may make sail at once from their berths. Those bound westward, unless with a fresh fair breeze outside to enable them to over-run the flood stream, should not quit the entrance channel until the latest moment, or they will be compelled to anchor outside to await the ebb stream. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels arriving off Boulogne in fine weather during neaps, and unable from their draught to enter, may anchor in about 10 fathoms, good holding ground, at the eastern edge of the Bassure de Baas, abreast of Vimereux. If surprised here by strong north-easterly winds, they can make for Ambleteuse road ; or, if a south-westerly gale should oblige them to seek refuge, they can run for the Downs or take shelter to leeward of the coast in the neigh bourhood of Calais. The COAST. \u2014 Creche point, bearing N.E. by N. 1\u00a3 miles from Boulogne South-west pier-head, is, as well as the intermediate coast, high and steep, and is at the western extreme of the range of hills separating the valley of the Liane from that watered by the river Wimille, on one of the .highest points of which range stands the column of the Grande Armee. At 1^ cables north-westward of the steep cliff is the small fort of Creche built on the rocks extending from the foot of the point."], [534, "512 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. The coast continues steep for nearly a mile from Creche point, but from thence to Vimereux it is bordered by high sand-hills. Three quarters of a mile north-eastward of Creche fort and a quarter of a mile from the shore is Croi tower, a small semi-circular fort of two tiers built on the rocks which uncover at low water, and rising 50 feet above the level of the beach. From \"Vimereux to Oies point, which bears N.N.E. \u00a3 E. 2 miles from Creche point, the coast is steep, but from thence to Audrecelles village, 2 miles farther northward, it is bordered by sand-hills of middling height covered with verdure. At 14^ miles northward of Oies point is the village of Ambleteuse, built on the northern side of Ambleteuse harbour, and, with the windmill on the high ground northward of the village, easily recognisable from the sea. Ambleteuse fort, like Croi tower, had two tiers of guns. From Ambleteuse to the village of Audrecelles, the shore consists of sand-hills covered with bent grass and intersected by small rivulets, through which the sea runs in upon the land at high water. This village stands on the shore, and is also defended by a small semi circular fort ; the church and windmills behind the village, are conspicuous objects and may be seen at some distance. From Audrecelles to Ridin point about 2 miles farther northward, the land adjoining the shore gradually rises and forms a succession of hills separated from each other by valleys, of which some run down to the coast ; but, between Ridin point and cape Grisnez, the land is more level and the cliff perpendicular, and, being nearly as high as cape Alprech, may be seen 12 to 15 miles distant. Between Ambleteuse and the rocks at Oies point, the beach is of sand and dries out 3j cables ; but, from Ambleteuse to Ridin point its breadth decreases and it consists of rocks covered with sand. The coast from Ridin point to cape Grisnez is bordered by a rocky shelf of which the projecting points do not extend beyond H cables from the foot of the cliffs. Coasters, with off-shore winds, should be cautious when approaching the shore between Croi tower and Audre celles, as a shoal bottom of uneven rock, on which there are only about 10 feet water, extends 5 or 6 cables from the coast. Vimereux, formerly a harbour, but now abandoned, is 1\u00a3 miles north-eastward of Creche fort, at the head of a small elbow in the shore between that fort and Oies point, The harbour was excavated, at the commencement of the present century, at the mouth of the river Wimille, to accomodate vessels of the flotilla intended for the invasion of England ; a freshet of that river having in after years"], [535, "Chap, x.] 513 THE COAST. \u2014 VIMEREUX. \u2014 AMBLETEUSE. broken down the sluice gates, the channel and piers were destroyed and the harbour filled up with sand and shingle. The waters of the river still follow their old channel but the bottom has risen so much that, at springs, there are only 5 or 6 feet in what used to be the harbour ; its destruction has caused the almost total desertion of the village which is now nearly covered with sand. Ambleteuse, a mile northward of Oies point, is, like Vimereux, so far as its harbour is concerned, in a complete state of ruin ; it is at the mouth of the little river Selack and great improvements were made at the beginning of the present century with the same object as at Vimereux. The ruins of a stone jetty-head and some piles in the north-western part of the harbour still mark the outline of a basin in which the vessels of the flotilla were placed, but it is now filled with sand and mud and has only 4 feet water in it at springs. The village has some reputation as a watering place. Ambleteuse Roads comprise the space between the Bassure de Baas and the coast, and extend from the parallel of Vimereux to that of Audrecelles. Vessels of deep draught bound to the northern ports of the Channel, or to Calais or Dunkerque, await spring tides in these roads if they arrive during neaps with northerly winds, and are fairly sheltered during gales from N.E. round by East to South ; the sea, however, is very heavy here when it blows strongly on a weather tide. The best anchorage is between the parallel of Vimereux and the line of the church towers of Ambleteuse and Bazinghen in one E. \u00a3 N., and a little in-shore of the rocky ground forming the western limit of the anchorage of Boulogne and which extends northward to the parallel of Ambleteuse. By not anchoring eastward of the small tower of Renard, a mile south-eastward of Portel, on with Boulogne South-west pier lighthouse S. 4 W., large vessels are in a good position to weigh should it blow strongly from the westward. A good berth for a vessel of deep draught is N.W. by W. of Vimereux, with Renard tower open about a quarter of a point westward of the South-west pier lighthouse, in about 8 fathoms hard muddy clay ; or, in 9 fathoms, good holding ground of muddy sand, with the lighthouse and Renard tower in line ; and, Bazinghen church tower open a little northward of Ambleteuse fort E. \u00a3 N. Large merchant vessels may anchor in 7 fathoms, hard sand and broken shells, on the latter bearing ; and, the column of the Grande Armee on with Croi fort. A. 2771. Wt. 17197. 2 K"], [536, "514 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. X. Boulogne pilots call the space between the eastern edge of the Bassure de Baas and the rocky bottom which bounds the anchorage in Ambleteuse road, the Parfondingue ; they state that ships of the deepest draught, requiring to remain some days in the roads, should be placed in the Parfondingue between the lines of the column of the Grande Armee on with the southern slope of Creche point, and Bazinghen tower on with Ambleteuse fort ; here they have sufficient room to weigh and round cape Grisnez if it comes on to blow hard from the S.W. : or, if it shifts to West or N.W., the crest of the bank shelters them from the heavy sea. To ride out a gale, they should be moored with open hawse to the westward and their anchors laid with a long scope of cable N.E. and S.W. in the direc tion of the tidal streams. Tides. \u2014 Abreast of Ambleteuse, at equinoctial springs, the greatest rate of the flood or north-eastern stream is from 3| to 4 knots, and, in ordinary weather, this rate continues nearly 24^ hours ; the stream follows nearly the direction of the channel and ends about 3\u00a3 hours after the time of high water at Boulogne. The ebb is less rapid, continues longer, and ends 24 hours before high water. The direc tion of the wind has great influence on both streams. Buoy. \u2014 An automatic whistle buoy, painted red and black in horizontal bands, is moored about 1\u00a3 miles from the shore N.W. by W. of Audrecelles, and 24 miles S.W. \u00a3 S. from cape Grisnez. CAPE GRISNEZ is 84 miles northward of Boulogne ; from it, cape Alprech bears S.S.W. 104 miles ; Dungeness W.N.W 23| miles ; South Foreland N. \u00a3 W. 17\u00a3 miles ; and, Beachy Head W. \u00a3 N. 524, miles. This cape, 167 feet high, is one of the most remarkable head lands on the northern coast of France and is visible in clear weather 14 or 15 miles ; from it, the coast changes its direction abruptly eastward, and this precipitous rocky cliff, as well as those southward and eastward of it, is of a dark grey colour and takes a purple tint when lighted up by the sun. A lighthouse stands on the south-western extreme of a small spot of level land crowning the cape ; some works of defence may also be seen rising above the same level land, and a guard-house at its extreme near the crest of the cliff. Large masses of rock lie at the foot of the cape, and a rocky shelf, partly covered with sand, dries at low water a quarter of a mile out from the cliffs ; the cape should, therefore, be given a berth of at least 4 cables when passing it."], [537, "Chap, x.] 515 CAPE GRISNEZ. \u2014 PAS DE CALAIS. LIGHT. \u2014 Cape Grisnez lighthouse is circular, 79 feet high from base to vane, a quarter of a mile southward of the cape, and about 100 yards from the edge of the cliff : it exhibits at 226 feet above high water an electric flashing light, showing three white flashes at intervals of three seconds, followed by an interval of twelve seconds, during which one red flash is shown. It is visible in clear weather 22 miles, but, in ordinary weather, the luminous glare caused byr it can be seen as much as 35 or 40 miles distant. This light cannot be mistaken for the light at Calais, which is also electric and white, but shows successive groups of four white flashes, with intervals between the groups three times as long as the intervals between the flashes of each group, nor for that at cape Alprech, which is white but not electric, and is varied every two minutes by a red flash. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station close to cape Grisnez lighthouse. PAS de CALAIS. \u2014 The narrowest part of this channel is 8\u00a3 miles wide, between the Ridge or Colbart shoal and cape Grisnez ; from thence, it runs nearly parallel with the coast as far as Boulogne, and then in a S.W. by W. \\ W. direction between the Bassurelle and Vergoyer shoals. With easterly winds, it is to be preferred to the Dover channel between the Varne and the English shore ; it is both wider and deeper, and is a continuation of the deep soundings channel of the North Sea in which the depth is above 20 fathoms. It is easily navigated by the lead either with a leading or beating wind, and even during fog or snow, the only danger being the northern end of the Ridge which rises abruptly' from the depth of 20 fathoms. To avoid the northern end of the Ridge, a vessel turning to wind ward in the Pas de Calais, either by day or night, when northward of the parallel of cape Grisnez and standing westward, should not bring the South Foreland lighthouses eastward of N. by E. ; and, when southward of that parallel, she should not go into less than 20 fathoms. A bearing of the Varne light-vessel is also very useful for avoiding this shoal. Tides and Tidal Streams.\u2014 (See also table page 518)\u2014 It is high water, full and change, on the beach a little eastward of cape Grisnez at llh. 27m., ordinary springs rise 214; feet, extraordinary springs 27 feet, neaps 16\u00a3 feet ; at Dungeness, at lOh. 45m., springs rise 2K2"], [538, "[Chap. X. CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. 516 21\u00a3 feet, neaps 19 feet ; and, at the Varne and Ridge shoals, at lOh. 40m. Within a circuit of 2 miles round the cape, the streams run stronger than at a greater distance from the shore ; the flood, or north-eastern stream, beginning 2 hours before and ending 3\u00a3 hours after high water at Boulogne, and running 4 knots when at its greatest strength, at springs. Between the Ridge and the shore, the north-eastern stream runs with much greater strength than the south western. The tidal streams, on the French coast, in the northern in-shore part of the English Channel are nearly of the same duration as in the bay of the Seine, the north-eastern stream running about 54; hours, and the south-western stream 64; hours. Towards the middle of the Channel, the streams run straight, throughout its length, until they have attained their greatest strength, when they follow the bends of the coast to a distance of 7 miles in the offing. In-shore of these limits, as soon as the north-eastern stream begins to be felt it turns towards the shore, but, as its strength increases, it tends more to its principal direction, viz., that which it follows when at its greatest strength and retains for the greatest length of time ; when its rate begins to decrease, it turns off-shore and takes different directions until the end of the tide. The south-western stream runs with less velocity and undergoes the same changes, but with this difference, that it varies much more in direction. At the Varne and Ridge shoals, the north-eastern stream does not commence until 44; hours flood, nor the south-western stream until 4\u00a3 hours ebb ; making 64 hours of north-eastern and 54; hours of south-western stream. Strong south-westerly gales prolong the north-eastern stream nearly an hour, and retard proportionally the south-western stream ; so that on some occasions, on the Ridge especially, 8 hours north eastern and only 4 hours south-western streams have been found. The rate of both streams increases in proportion to the narrowing of the Channel, and, in the channels between the banks, this rate is increased from half ebb to half flood. Between the Vergoyer and the shore, both streams make about an hour sooner than farther in the offing. Caution. \u2014 The deep bight in the coast between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez, constrains the flood stream to change its course about the meridian of point d'Ailly, and to turn E. by N. obliquely towards the coast between the river Somme and cape Grisnez ; but, with strong westerly winds, it runs much farther eastward and turns suddenly only a short distance from the \u2022 shore, causing a high sea."], [539, "Chap. X.] 517 TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 CAUTION Vessels from the westward bound to ports in the northern part of the Channel and running with a strong westerly wind, cannot be too attentive to the effects of this stream ; as soon as they have sighted either cape Barfleur light or that on St. Catherine point, they should act with great caution to avoid being set over on the French coast and should sound frequently after passing the meridian of cape d'Antifer, for, if they take the ground on any of the banks off the Somme or on the low coast in its vicinity, it will in all probability involve the loss of vessel and crew."], [540, "CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ.

Cape Grisnez 16\u00b0 25' W* Dunkerque 16\u00b0 10' W-. The COAST from cape Grisnez trends E. by N. \\ N. northerly 6 miles to cape Blanc-Nez, the intermediate land is high and may be seen in clear weather from 15 to 20 miles distant ; but, beyond the latter cape, the shore bends more eastward, the high land turns in a south-easterly direction towards the interior, and a level plain extends from its foot to the coast where it terminates in a low sandy shore bordered by ranges of sand-hills, of which the highest are visible only from 7 to 10 miles. Between the capes, the shore forms a slight bay, at the head of which is the village of Wissant, inhabited by fishermen, 2 miles inland of which is Mont Couple, 525 feet above the sea level. From about a mile eastward of cape Grisnez, where the cliffs of that cape terminate, to 1\\ miles north-eastward of Wissant, where the steep cliffs recommence, the coast is low and bordered by sand hills.* Cape Blanc-Nez owes its name to the high chalk cliff in which it terminates. It forms no marked projection, but its position may be recognized from a good distance at sea by the guard-house on the summit of the steep mound which crowns it, and which is the northern extreme of a range of hills joining Mont Couple. The last slopes of the high land forming the cape, as well as the steep coast in which they terminate, extend 1^ miles eastward, nearly as far as the village of Sangatte, and at this village commences the low sandy shore, which is the distinguishing feature of the remaining part of the French and of the Belgian coasts. The sand-hills are low to within \\\\ miles of Sangatte, but they gradually rise in height as they approach * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Dover strait, No. 1,895 ; scale m = 068 of an inch : North sea, sheet 1, Dover and Calais to Orfordness and Scheveningen, No. 1,046 ; scale, m = 0-3 of an inch : and, Calais to river Schelde, No. 1872 ; scale, m = 07 of an inch."], [542, "520 [Chap.

The principal objects on this part of the coast are, the windmill of Coquelles about 2 miles inland on the last slopes of the range of hills extending eastward of cape Blanc-Nez ; the windmill at Nieulay, northward of this ; the red buildings at Trouie or the Salines, about half way between Sangatte and Calais and about N.N.E. from Coquelles windmill, which are useful marks to the pilots, who call them les maisons rouges; and, the ramparts and citadel of Calais which rise above the sand-hills and may be seen some distance at sea. The strand in front of Sangatte is only a quarter of a mile wide at low water, but near the West pier at Calais it dries out half a mile. Within a quarter of a mile of it there are several shoal patches of 7 or 8 feet, and no vessel should get amongst them at low water. Telegraph cables. \u2014 The shore end of the cable connecting with the English coast, westward of Dover, is landed in the bight just eastward of cape Grisnez. Another cable leaving the shore at Sangatte is landed at the South Foreland. Bane a la Ligne. \u2014 The great prominence of cape Grisnez, together with the sudden change in direction of the coast which there occurs, occasions an extensive eddy north-eastward of it during the flood. The eddy no doubt caused the formation of this bank of sand and broken shells, which extends E.N.E. 4^ miles nearly from the cape, and nearly 2 miles from the shore abreast of Wissant. Its shoalest part uncovers from 4 to 6 feet at low water, springs, and towards its north-eastern extreme are several heaps of sand, named La Barriere, on the highest of which are only from 4 to 9 feet water ; the sea runs high on them with a fresh breeze on a weather tide. The south-western end of the bank has gradually joined itself to the land just eastward of the cape, and there is now, therefore, no channel at low water between the bank and the land where formerly there existed a passage several feet deep, but a new channel, called the North-west channel, has been formed near the middle of the bank. Buoy. \u2014 A red buoy with a triangular top marks the north eastern end of the Barriere sand.

In front of all the steep parts of the coast, flat rocks rise above the sand, and amongst them and farthest from the shore are the Gardes rocks which uncover 7 feet ; from their outer extreme, Wissant church tower bears S.W. by S. 2 miles ; and, the guard-house on cape Blanc-Nez, E. by N. 1^ miles. The Quenocs and Rouge-Ridin.\u2014 A rocky bottom, joining the shore and partly covered with sand, extends from the Gardes to Sangatte village, and 2 miles into the offing between the bearings N.N.W. and E.N.E. from cape Blanc-Nez ; its shoalest part forms two distinct dangerous flats of irregular rocks, named the Quenocs and Rouge-Ridin. The Quenocs, the western flat, is about half a mile in diameter, it has two heads with only 9 feet water ; from its centre, the guard house on cape Blanc-Nez bears S. by E. \u00a3 E. about 1^ miles ; and, Sangatte church tower E. by S. \u00a3 S. 2\\ miles. The Rouge-Ridin is nearer the shore, and nearly a mile in extent W.S.W. and E.N.E. ; from its shoalest head of 6 feet near the western end, the guard-house on cape Blanc-Nez bears S. \\ E. one mile. A shoal head of 9 feet also lies on the eastern edge of this flat, with the guard-house bearing S.S.W. \\ W. 1\\ miles, and Sangatte church tower E.S.E. 1\\ miles. The sea runs high on both flats with a fresh breeze on a weather tide. Sangatte church tower on with Coquelles windmill S.E., leads half a mile northward of the Rouge-Ridin.

Ridin de Calais. \u2014 This bank, about 4 miles long E.N.E. and W.S.W., commences N. by E. 1^ miles from Sangatte, and ends N. \u00a3 E. about 2\\ miles from the entrance to Calais. Its general depth varies from 5 to 8 fathoms ; the shoalest part is near the centre where for 1^ miles may be found spots of from 25 to 28 feet water ; from the south-western shoal head of 25 feet, the entrance to Calais bears S.E. by E. \\ E. 2f miles. The bank is dangerous at low water for vessels of deep draught only, but it occasions strong eddies and during fresh northerly winds there is a heavy sea on it, and breakers in north-easterly gales. RIDINS de la RADE, also named the Tetes, their western end in 30 feet commencing nearly a mile N. by W. from Calais pier heads, extend from thence eastward and south-eastward, and consist"], [544, "[Chap. XI. 522 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. of many heaps of sand, on the highest of which are only 4 feet water. This spot bears N.E. by E. \u00a3 E. 9^ cables from the east pier head. Another patch of 18 feet bears N. by E. \\ E. 9 cables from the same pier-head, and at varying distances between these bearings are several spots of from 6 to 9 and 16 feet water. These banks have steadily decreased in depth during the last fifty years and appear still to have the same tendency. A heavy sea runs on them with on-shore winds. Buoys.\u2014 A black bell buoy with perch and cross is moored in the centre of the deep between the Quenocs and these Ridins ; from it, Calais West pier-head bears E. by S. \\ S. 3| miles ; and, the Quenocs buoy W. by S. nearly 3 miles. A red buoy with perch and globe lies in 10 fathoms near the eastern end of the Ridin de Calais ; from it, Calais pier-heads bear S. i E. 2\\ miles ; Walde lighthouse S.E. by E. \\ E. 3\u00a3 miles ; and, Out-Ruytingen West buoy N.E. \u00a3 N. northerly 5\u00a3 miles. RADE de CALAIS, comprised between the Ridin de Calais and the sands westward of Calais harbour, affords anchorage with off-shore winds to vessels arriving off the harbour a few hours before the tide permits them to enter.

The road carries a depth of from 10 to 14 fathoms towards the Ridin de Calais, and from 7 to 9 fathoms at half a mile from the steep edge of the beach, with sandy bottom mixed with broken shells ; but, according to the pilots, the anchors penetrate into good holding ground beneath the sand, and ships of the largest size have ridden out north-westerly gales under the southern part of the Ridin. The holding ground is not so good near the shore. The anchorage is sheltered by the land from W.S.W. round to S.E., but it is quite open in all other directions. The Ridin can scarcely be considered as a shelter, although the waves break with great violence during a northerly gale on its whole extent ; the sea, how ever, is much quieter here than in the offing, and a vessel with good ground gear might ride out a gale in the northern part of the road. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station on the shore about 6 cables westward of Calais West pier."], [545, "Chap, xi.] ROAD AND PORT OF CALAIS. 523 CALAIS. \u2014 This port consists of a tidal harbour and a small basin named the Bassin du petit Paradis, both of which dry at low water ; a wet dock or basin under the ramparts of the citadel in which the largest vessels that can enter the harbour lie afloat ; and, a large reservoir containing the scouring water. The entrance is 11^ miles eastward of cape Grisnez ; S.E. \\ E. 22 miles from Dover pier ; and, S.E. \\ S. 20j miles from the South Foreland. In fine weather and with smooth water, vessels of at least 20 feet draught can enter the harbour at high water, springs, and of 15 feet at neaps ; but, with northerly winds, even when the sea is not too high to enter, vessels above 17 feet draught should not attempt it at springs, nor above 12^ feet at neaps. The average depth at the entrance and up to the Quai de Maree has, however, been greatly increased of late years by dredging and is maintained by flushing, but it varies in depth, north-easterly winds having a tendency to form a bar at the entrance.* With W.S.W. gales, which render the navigation of the English Channel so dangerous, the tide rises a foot or two higher than usual, and mariners should remember that when it blows strongly from between West and South and Boulogne is impracticable, Calais can be entered ; and, on the contrary, when it blows hard between North and E.N.E. and it is impossible to enter Calais, Boulogne can be entered. Calais has some foreign and a brisk coasting trade ; the vessels belonging to the port are chiefly employed in the cod, herring, and mackerel fisheries. In 1886 the population, including that of St. Pierre, now united with Calais under the one name, the ancient fortifi cations separating them having been levelled, was 54,000. The imports are coal, iron, wood, jute, woollens, cottons, &c. ; the exports, straw, eggs, silks, Parisian goods, &c. The number of vessels entering the port annually is about 2,000, of an aggregate of 500,000 tons. There is always a moderate stock of coals at reasonable prices and every facility for coaling either in the harbour or wet dock ; there is a gridiron and careening slip, but no establishments for repairs of consequence to vessels or machinery. The English and French mails cross the channel between Dover and Calais three times each way daily, the distance being accomplished under ordinary circumstances in 1\u00a3 hours. The Entrance Channel is about 328 feet wide between the piers and runs about 5 cables in a S.S.E. \\ E. direction from * See Admiralty plan of Calais, No. 2,556 ; scale in = 5 inches."], [546, "[Chap. XI. 524 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. the pier-heads to the entrance of the flushing reservoir. The pier heads bear from each other N.E. by E. and S.W. by W. ; both have been lengthened about 800 feet by open pilework, through which, as well as in front of the entrance, both flood and ebb streams flow across the direction of the channel. This arrange ment prevents the sand accumulating in front of the entrance, but it is a serious inconvenience to vessels entering or leaving at high water, as the north-eastern stream is then running at its greatest strength. The West pier has a small opening, about 1| cables from the end, to enable boats to load with sand from that side. At its inner end, it terminates in the towing path passing under the glacis of Fort Risban. The East pier has a quay with berths for the steam-packets, and cranes for landing goods and placing them at once in the trains, which run on the pier ; it is called the Quai de Maree, and has throughout its length a depth of 10\u00a3 feet at low water, springs ; it is chiefly used when there is not sufficient water alongside the Courgain quay in the harbour. The Harbour begins where the East pier joins the wall of the quay at the eastern part of the town. This wall continues along the whole length of the harbour, except where interrupted by the entrance to the Paradis basin, and by the sluice of the citadel ditch. The harbour is about 2,296 feet long by 230 feet wide, and its least central depth is that of low water, springs. The quays are spacious ; the Courgain or Colonne quay, between the Paradis basin and the East pier, is where vessels arriving after high water, or preparing to quit the harbour, are placed, and about one half of the quay between the entrance to the Paradis basin and the citadel sluice, is reserved for the mail and passage steamers ; the other half is for merchant vessels, and this part of the tidal harbour is known as the Import Dock. The railway station is on the Import dock quay, and, from it, sidings or branches run along both sides of the wet and import docks and, as before stated, to the Quai de Maree. There is a large crane which might be used for masting, and many smaller ones for loading or unloading ordinary cargo. The Wet dock has its entrance at the head of the Import dock ; it has an area of 20,000 square yards, with 590 yards extent of quays. The entrance between the gates is 55\u00a3 feet wide, and the sill is at the level of low water, ordinary springs. Its length is 1,230 feet, and its width 246 feet. Both harbour and wet dock are well sheltered from wind and sea ; a swell, however, runs into the"], [547, "Chap. XI.] CALAIS. \u2014 DOCKS. \u2014 TIDES. 525 entrance channel, the harbour, and the Paradis basin from half flood to half ebb when it blows strongly from the northward, and vessels alongside the Colonne quay then strike heavily upon a hard shingle bottom. The berths in the Import dock, westward of the entrance to the Paradis basin, are on both sides soft and good. New docks are in progress, especially a tidal harbour and wet dock for the mail steamers, which it is expected will be opened in the course of the year 1889, also a large flushing reservoir on the sands eastward of the piers, which will be filled each tide and discharged into the entrance channel at low water through a sluice near the east pier-head, in such volume as to wash away the bar outside and maintain a deep channel. All these new works are on the eastern side of the present harbour and town. Pilots. \u2014 Seven pilots are stationed at Calais ; they cruise in small schooners as far westward as Dungeness, and as far northward as the Galloper light- vessel. When the pilots are not able to get to sea, they indicate to approaching vessels the course to be steered by means of a mast working on a hinge at the East pier-head ; this mast is inclined towards the side towards which the vessel should steer. Steam-tug. \u2014 A steam-tug is attached to the port. Life-BoatS. \u2014 In case of shipwreck, there is a life-preserving mortar and apparatus at three distinct stations at Calais, and also two life-boats ; one of the latter is stationed on the eastern side, the other on the western side of the harbour. Tides and Tide Signals.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Calais harbour at llh. 49m. ; springs rise 21 feet ; neaps 17 feet. The slack at high water, springs, lasts about 20 minutes, and large vessels can be moved in the harbour during a period of 1^ hours. The slack at neaps often lasts for three quarters of an hour. The tides rise higher with strong winds from N.W. to W.S.W. than with those from East to S.S.E. The usual day tide signals, see page 8, are made from a mast close to the lighthouse on the East pier-head. Tidal Streams. \u2014 The mean duration of the flood or eastern stream, at springs, in front of the entrance is 5^ hours, and of the ebb 1\\ hours. At half a mile outside the piers, the flood runs 2^ or 3 hours after high water in the harbour, and with strong westerly winds, \u00b1\\ or 5 hours ; with easterly winds, it continues only 1^ or 2 hours after high water in the harbour. The rate of the flood at extraordinary springs is 4^ knots."], [548, "526 [Chap. XI. CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. LIGHTS.\u2014 Calais Lighthouse, octagonal and 167 feet high, stands on one of the bastions of the fortifications at the north-eastern side of the town, and exhibits, at 190 feet above high water and visible 25 miles, an electric, group-flashing, white light, showing successive groups of four white flashes, with intervals between the groups three times as long as the intervals between the flashes of each group. West Pier. \u2014 A fixed red light, 23 feet above high water and visible 4 miles, is exhibited from a mast at the outer end of the West pier. This light is not shown in bad weather, access to the West pier-head being then impracticable. East Pier \u2014 Tide Lights. \u2014 From a white turret at the East pier-head 19 feet high and 27 feet above high water, the following tide lights, visible 9 miles distant, are shown, and are similar to those used at Dunkerque : \u2014 A. fixed red light indicates less than &\\ feet but tide rising. A fixed green light indicates less than 6^ feet and tide falling. A fixed ivhite light indicates the depth from 6^ feet to 7\u00a3 feet. A fixed white light varied by groups of red and green flashes indicates depths of more than 1\\ feet. The groups of coloured flashes are separated by intervals of eighty seconds, and the flashes in each group by intervals of five seconds ; each red flash showing an additional 3 feet 4 inches to the initial height of 6Jy feet, and each green flash adding 10 inches more. Whilst the tide is rising, the fixed light, of either colour, is eclipsed for a short interval every eighty seconds; and, when it is falling, the light is eclipsed twice in quick succession every eighty seconds ; these eclipses occur nearly in the middle of the intervals separating groups of flashes. No eclipse takes place at or about high water. Fog Signals. \u2014 A bell is sounded continuously in foggy weather from the turret of the East jetty during the time the port is accessible ;* see also note, page 10. For the use of the Mail Service, during foggy weather, a gun is fired from the East pier-head every five minutes at the time the mail steamer is expected. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 From the Westward.\u2014 As a general rule, cape Blanc-Nez should be sighted when bound either to Calais, * As no one is specially appointed to sound this bell, it often happens that it is not sounded. \u2014 \" Pilote des Cotes Nord de France,\" Vol. 2, 1884."], [549, "Chap. XI.] CALAIS. \u2014 LIGHTS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 527 Gravelines, or Dunkerque. The most favourable winds for entering Calais harbour are those from W.S.W. round by North to East. Moderate on-shore winds only cause a heavy swell on the beach, but when strong they send in a heavy sea and it is then dangerous to enter. Under these circumstances, which are frequent in winter, vessels bound for the northern ports of France should immediately run for Boulogne ; and, it should be borne in mind that at this, and at all French ports of any importance a red flag is shown at the tide signal-staff when the port is rendered inaccessible by weather. Vessels running for Calais from the South-west, when on the parallel of and about a mile from cape Grisnez, should steer about N.E. by E. \\ E., taking care not to bring the extreme of the cape westward of S.W. W. in order to keep outside the Barriere and the Quenocs rocks.- When Sangatte church tower is on with Coquelles windmill, S.E., steer about E.S.E. for the centre of Calais, leaving the black bell buoy on the port-hand ; and, when abreast of it, or when Audinghen church tower, near cape Grisnez, is hidden behind the cliff at cape Blanc-Nez, if there is water sufficient to enter the harbour a course should be shaped for the entrance ; if not, an anchorage should be sought for in the southern part of Calais road. The largest vessels the harbour admits, may pass at all times of tide between the Quenocs and the Barriere, by keeping Sangatte church tower on with either of the three towers of Calais ; they may also pass between the Rouge-Ridin and the shore, from half flood to half ebb. At Night, cape Grisnez light should not be brought westward of S.W. i W. to avoid the Barriere and the Quenocs, and when Calais light bears E.S.E., steer about E. by S. ; then, if the ebb or western stream is running, anchor as soon as cape Grisnez light is about to be hidden behind the cliff at cape Blanc-Nez ; but, if the flood, and there is sufficient water in the entrance, steer for the red light on the West pier-head which must be rounded close to. From the Northward. \u2014 Between one third flood and two thirds ebb in Calais harbour, either by day or night, vessels from the northward with a fresh fair wind may run directly for the entrance over the Ridin de Calais, where there is then sufficient water. If late on the ebb, run on the meridian of cape Blanc- Nez until Sangatte church tower is on with Coquelles windmill S.E. ; then steer, if the weather is favourable, for the anchorage in the southern part of Calais road."], [550, "[Chap. XI. 528 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. At Night, steer for Calais light on an E.S.E. bearing until Cape Grisnez light bears W.S.W., then steer E. \\ S. until Cape Grisnez light is just masked behind Cape Blanc-Nez, when anchor if the ebb is running, or, if the flood, steer for the harbour. Entering the Harbour.\u2014 The most favourable time for entering Calais harbour with an on-shore wind is at high water ; but, with the wind abeam or ahead, at half or three quarters of an hour before that time, so as to have time to be tracked up to the quays, or into the wet dock. It should- 'be borne in mind, however, that during calm weather, at half a mile outside the entrance, the flood or eastern stream continues to be felt 2\\ or 3 hours, and with strong westerly winds 4^ or 5 hours after high water in the harbour, and is at its greatest strength at the time of high water there. For this reason, whatever the direction of the wind, the West pier-head should be steered for, to avoid being set eastward of the entrance, and this precaution is particularly necessary when standing for the harbour on the starboard tack ; the bower anchors and a stern anchor should then be ready for letting go, and hawsers ready to run out in the event of being drifted on the East pier. All sail should be carried, especially with the wind right aft, to stem the flood and to pass quickly through the swell at the entrance. Should a vessel with a strong westerly wind and without a pilot miss the entrance, she must anchor immediately as near as possible to the East pier-head and take in a pilot, whose assistance will then be indispensable. Vessels may get out of harbour and gain an offing on a weather tide against a head wind by making sail from the end of the West pier. BANKS Off the NORTH COAST of FRANCE.\u2014 The approach to this low and dangerous coast is obstructed by numerous banks of grey and black sand, which extend as far as 15 miles from the shore on the meridian of Calais, and 42 miles in a north-easterly direction from Dunkerque. They are all long and narrow, and con verge in direction towards the straits of Dover. Their shoalest spots may be touched upon by vessels of almost any draught, and the eddies they occasion cause a hollow sea which breaks on them when it blows hard. Those farthest from the land lie on the eastern side of the 20-fathoms line of soundings, which, in the southern part of the North Sea, is the eastern limit of the deep known as the deep soundings channel, which begins in Dover strait and ends at about lat. 53\u00b0 20' N."], [551, "Chap, xi.] DUNKERQUE AND OTHER BANKS. 529 The banks are all steep-to on their in-shore edge and extend with a gentle slope towards the offing, and, as they rise from the sub marine bank of sand, gravel, and broken shells which joins the shore, and on which there are everywhere less than 20 fathoms, the simple precaution of not going into less than that depth ensures keeping outside all these banks. The lights at cape Grisnez and Calais are in a good position to point out at night their western limit ; the electric flashing light at Dunkerque, seen in clear weather 20 miles, gives notice of approach to the greater part of them, and the navigation is still further facilitated by the two light-vessels moored within the Hinder banks, by that north-eastward of the Ruytingen, and by others more in-shore. The dangers of the in-shore navigation can only be avoided by placing the vessel in charge of a good pilot, for the banks are all so liable to changes in their formation that no description of them can be considered permanently reliable ; generally speaking, none of the banks should be approached except a vessel is bound for one of the harbours on the coast. The banks are divided into two groups, those nearest the shore, eleven in number, being named the Dunkerque banks ; others, six in number, lying some distance from the coast and northward of the Dunkerque banks, were but little known until surveyed by the late Captain W. Hewett, R.N., in H.M.S. Fairy between 1831-1840; they are, the Fairy, North Hinder, West Hinder, East Hinder, and Bligh banks, and Thornton ridge. DUNKERQUE BANKS, eleven in number, extend 15 miles from the coast between the meridians of Calais and the frontier of Belgium. Their names are, the Sandettie, Out-Ruytingen, In Ruytingen, Bergues, Dyck (the north-eastern part of which is called the Cliff-d'Islande or East Clif), In-Ratel, Out-Ratel, Haut-fond de Gravelines, Breedt, Smal, and the bank bounding Dunkerque road to the northward, of which different parts are named Snouw, Braeck, Hils, and Traepegeer. Sandettie\\ in Flemish the Zand-detie, called also by local French mariners the Ourting, is the outer and westernmost of the Dun kerque banks ; it is about 12 miles long E. by N. \\ N. and W. by S. i S., its breadth varying from 4 cables to a mile. Its southern and south eastern edges are steep-to, having from 19 to 20 fathoms water at less than half a cable from the southern edge, but its slope is more gradual towards the North-west and this side may be easily avoided by the lead.

The eastern flat, with only 21 feet water, bears N.W. by N. 18 miles from Dunkerque lighthouse, and N.E. by N. 17 miles from that at Calais ;. and, the centre of the western flat, on which there are only 20 feet, lies W. by S. 3\u00a3 miles from the eastern flat ; N.W. i N. from Dunkerque lighthouse ; and, N.N.E. \u00a3 E. from that at Calais. Besides these flats, other heaps of sand, with from 21 to 25 feet water, extend H miles in a W. by S. direction from the western flat, but, on other parts of the bank, the depths vary from 31 to 46 feet. The Sandettie, rising suddenly from comparatively deep water, causes strong ripplings, and, with a fresh breeze, the sea is heavy around it and breaks on the shoal flats. From the south-western end of the bank, which is steep-to, in 8 or 9 fathoms, the following lights may be seen in clear weather : \u2014 Cape Grisnez S.W. S. 20 miles ; Calais S. by W. 12i miles ; Gravelines S.S.E. \u00a3 E. 15 miles ; Dunkerque S.E. \u00a3 E. 22 miles and just visible ; and, South Foreland lights W. by N. 16 miles. In the daytime, in clear weather, the summit of Mont Couple may be recognized bearing S.S.W. \\ W. nearly 19 miles ; also, the South Foreland and the white cliffs near Dover. The north eastern end of the Sandettie, on which there are 9 fathoms water, bears N. by W. \u00a3 W. 18 miles from Dunkerque light, and N.N.W. W. 6\u00a3 miles from Ruytingen light-vessel. Out-Ruytingen, midway between the coast of France and the Sandettie, is separated from the latter by a channel from 5 to 6 miles wide, with soundings of from 14 to 20 fathoms. Its western end is about 7 miles from the shore on the meridian of Calais lighthouse ; from thence, it extends 7 miles eastward and then curves 9 miles in an E.N.E. direction to the position of the light-vessel, beyond which to the 10-fathoms line it extends 2^ miles farther, but with nothing less than 7 fathoms water. The bank rises almost per pendicularly from the bottom on its south-eastern side, but falls with a gentle slope north-westward. Those parts on which there are less than 5 fathoms water form two flats, with a channel of from 5 to 9 fathoms and 2 miles wide between them ; from the centre of this channel, GraveJines lighthouse bears S.S.E. 4 E., and Calais lighthouse S.W. \\ S. ; vessels bound to either of these ports may pass over the shoal between these flats at any time of tide, with Gravelines light house bearing S. by E. \u00a3 E. leaving Nos. 2 and 4 buoys on the starboard hand and No. 7 buoy on the port hand."], [553, "Chap.

The Out-Ruytingen occasions strong eddies and with a fresh breeze the sea breaks on the shoalest parts and is heavy on its edges. There are irregularities of bottom extending westward of this bank as far as the bearing N. \\ W. from Calais lighthouse, and small vessels should avoid crossing them in bad weather on account of the high sea they occasion. LIGHT- VESSEL. \u2014 About one mile from the eastern end of the eastern flat of Out-Ruytingen, and in 10 fathoms water, is moored a light-vessel exhibiting at 33 feet above the sea a red revolving light, which attains its greatest brilliancy every half minute, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 10 miles.

The north-eastern end of the East Dyck is a formidable danger ; here the depths are only from 3 to 4 fathoms and the sea is always disturbed around it, as it rises abruptly from depths of 15 and 17 fathoms and is therefore difficult to be avoided by the lead, however quickly hove. From the shoal spot of 3 fathoms, the West Hinder light-vessel bears N.W. 3^ miles ; Dunkerque lighthouse N.E. \u00a3 N. 19 miles ; and; Ostende lighthouse S.E. E. 16 miles ; but, this end of the bank being so far from the low land, the most remarkable objects can be recognised, even 'from the mast-head, only in very clear weather ; at such times, Dunkerque light may be seen 5 or 6 miles farther. DYCK LIGHT-VESSEL, moored in about 6 fathoms 3 miles in-shore of the shoalest part of the West Dyke and N.E. \\ E. 2\u00a3 miles from Gravelines pier-head lights, shows at 39 feet above the sea, a flashing ivhite light visible 11 miles. The flashes occur every twenty seconds and are preceded and followed by short eclipses. The vessel is painted with red and black bands, has the word Dyck in white letters on each side, and carries a cage painted red at her mast-head. Fog bell. \u2014 In foggy weather, a bell is sounded for one minute every three minutes, and continuously in reply to a passing vessel. From the Dyck light-vessel, the Snouw light-vessel bears E. by S. \\ S. 2\u00a3 miles. The two light-vessels in line lead through the West Pass into Dunkerque road. In-Ratel. \u2014 This bank is, properly speaking, only a branch of the Middle Dyck, being joined to its south-western end by a narrow"], [557, "Chap. XL] DYCK, RATEL, AND GRAVELINES BANKS. 535 4-fathoms sandy ridge ; it is high and steep-to on all sides, and, from its western end in 22 feet, N. \\ E. 5^ miles from Mardick church tower, it trends E. \u00a3 N. 7 miles, where, on and near its eastern end, at between 6 and 7 miles N.N.E. \\ E. from Dunkerque lighthouse, shoal ground of from 15 to 25 feet rises suddenly from soundings of 7 or 8 fathoms. Its extreme breadth, about a mile, is near the middle of the bank where there is a shoal flat 2 miles long with only from I to 9 feet water, and with less than 6 feet for more than a mile of its extent, From this dangerous part, Dunkerque lighthouse bears S. by E. \\ E. 5| miles. The channel separating the In-Ratel from the Breedt in-shore of it, is barred between the western flats of these banks by a heap of sand on which are about 3\u00a3 fathoms water. There are 8 and 12 fathoms in this channel at a short distance eastward and westward of this bar. Out-Ratel is an isolated bank, and within the 5-fathoms line is 9 miles long and about a mile wide ; it lies south-eastward of and parallel with the East Dyck, from which it is separated by a deep channel from 2 to 2\\ miles wide. Its name, meaning rattle, is perhaps derived from the noise caused by the heavy sea on it in bad weather. Near its south-western end, about a mile northward of the eastern end of the Breedt, is a dangerous flat with only 8 feet water. This shoal spot lies N.E. \\ N. 10 miles from Dunkerque lighthouse ; from thence, the bank extends N.E. by E. easterly Si miles, including the shoal patches of 3\u00a3 and 4 fathoms near its north-eastern extreme. The Out-Ratel, having for 7| miles of its extent only from 9 to 15 feet water, ought not to be crossed, even by small vessels, without great care. It is separated from the East Dyck, as well as from the eastern end of the Breedt, by soundings of from 7 to 12 fathoms. A bank, 1\u00a3 miles long with only 25 feet water, lies N.N.W. \u00a3 W. 1^ miles from its north-eastern end, and is separated from it by soundings of from 10 to 13 fathoms. When in-shore of the West Hinder, by not bringing Ostende lighthouse eastward of S.E. S., a vessel keeps north-eastward of all the banks between the East Dyck and Middelkercke bank, which latter is the most western of the Ostende banks. The West Hinder light-vessel also affords a good mark for clearing them, but constant attention should be paid to the lead. Haut-Fond de Gravelines, a small sandy flat a mile in extent on which the least water is 19 feet, lies 1^ miles westward of the western end of the Breedt bank ; from the shoalest spot Gravelines lighthouse"], [558, "[Chap.

Buoy. \u2014 A spindle buoy marks the eastern extreme of the Haut fond de Gravelines ; from it, the Dyck light-vessel bears S. \u00a3 W., and the Snouw bell and reflector buoy, S.E. \\ E. easterly. Breedt Bank.\u2014 This is the largest of the Dunkerque banks, and joins the In-Ratel by a bar of sand with 3\u00a3 fathoms water. Its western extreme in 5 fathoms bears N. by W. 3\u00a3 miles from Gravelines point ; N.E. \\ N. 4\u00a3 miles from Gravelines lighthouse ; and, N.E. \u00a3 E. 1\u00a3 miles from the Dyck light-vessel. From thence, it trends E. \u00a3 S. <o\\ miles, and then E. by N. \u00a3 N. 8\u00a3 miles to its eastern extreme in 5 fathoms, which bears N.E. \\ E. 10 miles from Dunkerque lighthouse ; and, N.N.W. 9^ miles from Fumes. There are three dangerous flats on the Breedt, with channels across the bank between them with not less than 15 feet water, The western flat, with only 2 feet least water, is 2\\ miles long, lies 3 miles from the shore, is half a mile wide, and, from its centre, Mardick church tower bears South. The middle flat, which is the largest, is . of an oval shape, H miles long by 1\\ miles wide ; from its shoalest part, where, in 1879, 2\\ feet was the least depth found though formerly it used to uncover 5 feet, Dunkerque pier-heads bear South about 3 miles. The channel between this and the western flat has from 3 to ?>\\ fathoms. The eastern flat is 5 miles long N.E. by E. \\ E. and S.W. by W. \\ W., and 6 cables wide ; it commences N.N.E. \\ E. 4 miles from Dunkerque lighthouse and extends to within 1\u00a3 miles of the eastern end of the bank ; there are shoal patches of only 6 feet, and general depths of from 8 to 9 feet, on this flat ; its western end is separated from the eastern end of the middle flat by an interval of one mile, with from 2 to 2\u00a3 fathoms water ; but all these banks are very liable to temporary changes in form and depth. East Breedt Bank is a continuation north-eastward of the Smal Bank ; within the 5-fathoms line, it is one mile wide and 5 miles long N.E. 7j E. and S.W. \\ W. ; its shoalest part, commencing near the south-western end, is 3 miles long and half a mile wide, with from 13 to 18 feet water. From the south-western end of this flat, Dunkerque lighthouse bears S.W. \u00a3 W. 14^ miles; and, Nieuport pier-heads S.S.E. \\ E. 6| miles. The north-eastern extreme of the bank terminates in some shoal patches of 25 feet, of which the most"], [559, "Chap. XL] BREEDT, SMAL, AND DUNKERQUE ROAD BANKS. 537 eastern bears N. f E. from Nieuport and is 9 miles distant from the pier-heads. From this position, Dunkerque lighthouse bears S.W . \u00a3 W. 19^ miles ; and, Ostende lighthouse S.E. | E. easterly 10 miles. Smal Bank.\u2014 The western end of this bank lies 2\\ miles from Dunkerque lighthouse, with the lighthouse and church tower in line ; it is connected with the middle flat of Breedt bank by a bar with only 12 or 13 feet water, and has as little as 2 feet within half a mile of this end. From its western end, it trends E. \\ N. 6 miles and then N.E. by E. \\ E. 8^ miles to its north-eastern end, which bears about N. by E. from Fumes, and N. by W. \\ W. westerly 5i miles from Nieuport pier-heads. The southern part of this bank, near its north-eastern end, joins Nieuport bank by a narrow bar with 18 feet water ; here the towers at Fumes are on with the eastern part of a high sand-hill, named Broers-Duyn, bearing South. These banks bomid Nieuport road on the North, and are extremely steep to near their point of junction. Besides the small 2-feet flat at its western end, a dangerous flat about 8 miles long, with from one to 9 feet water, rises from the Smal bank, commencing N.E. \\ N. 3 miles from Dunkerque light house and extending without interruption as \"far as N. by W. \\ W. from Furnes. It is joined to the flat on Hils bank, in-shore of it, by a shoal bar of from 10 to 12 feet ; from the centre of which bar, Dunkerque church tower is just open eastward of Leuguenaerd tower. Between the eastern end of this flat and the north-eastern extreme of the bank, are several patches of from 9 to 16 feet water. BANK bounding DUNKERQUE ROAD.\u2014 The successive parts of this long bank are, the Snouw, Braeck, Hils, and Traepegeer. From the western end of the Snouw in 5 fathoms to the point of junction with the shore of the eastern part of the Traepegeer, the length of the united banks is not less than 16^ miles ; their width, from 3 cables to a mile. They give shelter to Dunkerque road, which is entered from the westward by the West pass', and from the eastward by the Zuydcoote pass, the whole of the southern side of the banks being well buoyed. See page 550. Snouw bank, the western part of the long bank just described, is 4 miles in length E. \\ S. and W. \\ N. with less than 3 fathoms, and its highest parts form a narrow flat 2^ miles long with as little as 2 feet water at one part. The western end of the Snouw is 2 miles from the shore at Gravelines point ; N.E. \\ E. 4 miles from Gravelines light house ; and, W.N.W. 7-j% miles from Dunkerque lighthouse."], [560, "538 [Chap. XL CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. Buoy. \u2014 A bell buoy with reflector, painted with red and black bands, is moored at the western end of the Snouw bank ; from it, the Snouw light-vessel bears E.S.E. 1^ miles ; the Dyck light-vessel W. \\ N. 1\\ miles nearly \u25a0 and, Gravelines lighthouse N.E. E. 4 miles. LIGHT-VESSEL.\u2014 The Snouw light-vessel, painted with red and black bands, carries a ball at her mast-head and has her name, Snouw, painted in white letters on both sides ; she lies in about 11 fathoms in the West Pass, near the western end of the Snouw, and shows a fixed red' light, visible in clear weather 7 miles. This light -vessel bears E. by S. \\ S. 2\u00a3 miles from the Dyck light-vessel ; the two light-vessels in line lead into Dunkerque road. Fog bell. \u2014 In foggy weather a bell is sounded for one minute every three minutes, and continuously in reply to passing vessels. Braeck bank is only separated from the Snouw by a narrow 21-feet channel. It is about 5 miles long E. by S. and W. by N., beginning abreast of the centre of the Snouw, about 1\u00a3 miles from the shore on the meridian of Mardick, and ending just eastward of the meridian of Dunkerque. On its highest parts, which form a flat from one to 3 cables wide, are only from one to 2 feet water, and some patches even dry at the lowest tides. The Braeck is steep-to, its sides rising from the bottom like a wall, and with northerly winds the sea breaks upon it with great fury. Its western end in 3\u00a3 fathoms and the shallow flats extending from the shore, are connected by a sandy shoal or bar running in a W.S.W. direction across the West Pass. On this bar, there are from 5 to 5\u00a3 fathoms, deepening to 7 or 8 fathoms the moment it is passed in either direction. Hils bank is a continuation of the Braeck, extending 3^ miles farther in an easterly direction and terminating suddenly in the Zuydcoote Pass, the narrow 19-feet channel which separates it from the Traepegeer bank. This end of Hils bank, at its south-eastern angle, is only 1^ miles from the shore ; and, N. \\ W. from Zuydcoote tower, in ruins, and called also Sables or Sands tower. From this angle, the edge of the bank extends N.E. \\ N. 1\\ miles, forming the north-western side of the Zuydcoote Pass. The highest part of the bank forms a flat from 2 to 8 cables wide, on the southern part of which, large patches dry as much as 6 feet at low water about N.E. by E. from Dunkerque lighthouse ; and, on the remainder, are only from one"], [561, "Chap.XI.] SNOUW,BRAECK,HILS,TRAEPEGEER, AND FAIRY BANKS. 539 to 6 feet. The southern side rises precipitously from depths of from 7^ to 10 fathoms, rendering it exceedingly dangerous, but for the buoys marking its edge, to vessels turning to windward in the eastern part of Dunkerque road. Traepegeer bank bounds Dunkerque road eastward, and its western end forms the eastern side of the East or Zuydcoote Pass. The Traepegeer joins the shore in the neighbourhood of Broers-Duyn, the high sand-hill before mentioned, and from thence extends along the coast to the entrance of Nieuport. Its western extreme, on which there are from 7 to 13 feet water, is only 2 cables from the south eastern angle of Hils bank, and bears N. E. from Zuydcoote or Sables tower ; the outer part of the bank extends from 2f to If miles from the shore, and the depths vary between 6 and 18 feet, though one part, near the centre and on the outer side, has only one foot water. BANKS NORTH of DUNKERQUE BANKS.\u2014 These banks, referred to at page 529, are dangerous, not only from their shallowness and their being so liable to change in form that anything but the latest charts may be very misleading, but also from their being at so great a distance from the shore and directly in the route of vessels bound for the Schelde. See also the caution at page 563 as to the slight rise of tides on these banks. Fairy bank, a high sandy ridge with from 3\u00a3 to 9 fathoms water, is on the eastern side of the deep-soundings channel, and the channel between it and the West Hinder is 2\u00a3 miles wide. From its southern end in 8 fathoms, Dunkerque lighthouse bears S. \\ W. westerly 18 miles ; and, the West Hinder light -vessel East 6\u00a3 miles. From thence, it extends N.E. easterly 9^ miles, its greatest breadth not exceeding 8 cables. There are two flats on this bank ; that near the middle, with less than 5 fathoms water, is 2\\ miles long, and, from its shoalest spot of 3\u00a3 fathoms, Dunkerque lighthouse bears S. by W. \\ W. 22 miles ; the Galloper light-vessel N. by W. \u00a3 W. westerly 25^ miles ; and, the West Hinder light-vessel S.E. \\ S. 4^ miles. The other flat is near the northern end of the bank ; from its shoalest spot of 5^ fathoms, the West Hinder light-vessel bears South 6 miles. Dunkerque lighthouse may be seen in clear weather from the southern end of the Fairy bank. A shoal about 8 miles in length, with from 6^ to 9 fathoms water, lies 2 miles westward of and nearly parallel with the Fairy bank."], [562, "540 [Chap. XL CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. North Hinder, a dangerous sand-bank, situated like the Fairy on the eastern side of the deep-soundings channel, is 7 miles long N.E. by N. and S.W. by S., and from 5 to 8 cables wide, the general depth being from 6 to 9 fathoms ; but, on its southern part, a narrow flat with only 4 and 5 fathoms extends 2\\ miles southward from about the middle of the bank, and is steep-to on its eastern side. The northern end of the bank lies E.S.E. southerly 24^ miles from the Galloper light-vessel ; and, the southern end, N.E. \\ E. easterly 8 miles from the Fairy. The North Hinder may be considered as an extension of the Fairy, and between these banks are three flats, of which two, with from 8 to 10 fathoms water, occupy a space 3 miles in length midway between the banks ; the third, with 9 fathoms, lies 2 miles eastward of the northern end of the Fairy. Vessels should not go eastward of a line joining the Fairy to the North Hinder under any circumstances unless bound to the Schelde. LIGHT-VESSEL.\u2014 The North Hinder light-vessel is moored in 20 fathoms water, on the eastern side of the bank ; she exhibits from her mainmast-head, at 40 feet above the sea, a flashing white light at intervals of eight or ten seconds, visible in clear weather 11 miles. The vessel has two masts, is coloured red, and has the words Noord-Hinder painted in large white letters on her sides. During the day she carries a red ball at her mainmast-head. Fog Signal. \u2014 In thick or foggy weather a bell is struck every quarte/ of an hour, preceded and followed by strokes of a gong. Note. \u2014 If the apparatus of the light is out of repair, a fixed white light will be exhibited in lieu of the flashing light, and a flare light will be shown every ten minutes just above the bulwarks. If the light-vessel is out of position, neither the flashing light nor the usual riding-light will be shown, but red lights will be exhibited at bow and stern. Buoy. \u2014 A red buoy with the word Hinder in white letters is moored in 6 fathoms water at the northern end of the shoal flat of the North Hinder, and N. \u00a3 E. 2 miles from the light-vessel. Vessels of deep draught should keep northward of the buoy if crossing the North Hinder, and must bear in mind that the buoy being in its correct position cannot be depended on."], [563, "Chap. XL] HINDER BANKS. 541 West Hinder, a sand-bank 15 miles long within the 10-fathoms line, and from 7 cables to 1\u00a3 miles wide, lies eastward of the Fairy and southward of the North Hinder. Its southern end in 9 fathoms bears N.N.E. 18| miles from Dunkerque ; N.W. by W. \u00a3 W. 4 miles from the north-eastern end of the East Dyck ; and, E. \u00a3 S. 5 miles from the southern end of the Fairy ; from thence, the bank trends N.E. \u00a3 E. 8^ miles and then N.N.E. \u00a3 E. 6^ miles to its northern end, which is \\\\ miles S.S.E. of the southern end of the North Hinder. A flat occupies nearly the whole length of the bank and forms a continuous crest on which the depths are from 9\u00a3 to ih fathoms. By daylight, the West Hinder may generally be known by the tide ripples over it ; but the lead should be kept carefully hove when approaching this or any of the Flemish banks. The only passage practicable for large vessels bound to Flushing and intending to enter the Schelde by the Wieling Gat, is between the Out-Ruytingen, Bergues, and East Dyck on the one side ; and, the Fairy and West Hinder on the other. LIGHT-VESSEL.\u2014 Near the south-western end of the West Hinder bank, and On its eastern side, in 17 fathoms water, and in lat. 51\u00b0 22' 30\" N., long. 2\u00b0 26' 26\" E., is moored a light-vessel which exhibits at 40 feet above the sea a revolving light visible in clear weather 12 miles, and showing two white faces and one red face successively, with half minute intervals between each face. The vessel is black with a red streak, with the words West Hinder painted on each side, and a skeleton framework at her mast-head. From the light-vessel, Wielingen light-vessel bears E. by S. \\ S. southerly 29^ miles ; the northern end of the East Dyke bank in 5 fathoms S.E. \u00a3 E. 3\u00a3 miles ; and, the Bergues bank buoy S.W. by W. \\ W. 8 miles. Note. \u2014 Should the revolving apparatus be out of order, it will be replaced by two fixed lights, vertical ; the upper red, the lower white, and a white flare light will be shown every ten minutes. Should the light-vessel drift from her station, the revolving light will be replaced by three fixed lights, vertical, the centre light red, the other two ivhite ; by day, in this latter case, a red flag will be hoisted at the mainmast-head. Should the light-vessel require assistance ; by day, she will show the flags NIC. of the International Code ; by night, in addition to the distinguishing and anchor lights, a white light will be shown at the taffrail and a red rocket will be fired every fifteen minutes."], [564, "542 [Chap. XL CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. Fog Signal- \u2014 During foggy weather a siren is sounded, giving a prolonged blast at two minute intervals. Should the siren be out of order, the signal will be a bell sounded repeatedly at two minute intervals. East Hinder, a sand-bank 11 miles long N.E. by N. and S.W. by S., within a depth of 10 fathoms, and 6 or 7 cables wide, lies eastward of the West and North Hinder ; it has three flats, with from 3\u00a3 to 5 fathoms on them and 6 or 7 fathoms between them, which occupy 8\u00a3 miles of its extent. The bank is steep-to on both sides and separated from the North Hinder by a channel 3 miles wide with from 16 to 19 fathoms water ; and, from the West Hinder, by a channel 1\u00a3 miles wide with from 15 to 19 fathoms wTater. The northern end of the bank, in 9 fathoms, lies S.E. \u00a3 S. 4 miles nearly from the northern end of the North Hinder ; and, the southern end, N.E. by N. 8| miles from the northern extreme of the East Dyck. Its central shoal spot of 3\u00a3 fathoms bears S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. 3 miles from the North Hinder light-vessel. About midway between the southern end of the East Hinder and the East Dyck, there is a narrow shoal 41 miles long with from 5 to 8 fathoms water ; it lies 1^ miles eastward of the West Hinder and its southern extreme is 2 miles northward of the northern end of the East Dyck. Bligh Bank, also of sand, is 10^ miles long, from 5 cables to 1\u00a3 miles wide, and lies about 3 miles eastward of and nearly parallel with the East Hinder. Its northern end in 10 fathoms is in lat, 51\u00b0 41V N., long. 2\u00b0 48' 45\" E., and lies N.W. i, W. 25^ miles from West Kapelle lighthouse ; and, S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. easterly 32 miles from the Galloper light-vessel. Its southern end, in 5\u00a3 fathoms, lies E. by N. 5 miles nearly from the southern extreme of the East Hinder ; and, N.E. \\ E. 13 miles from 3 fathoms on the northern end of the East Dyck. This bank is also steep-to and has irregular depths of from 4\u00a3 to 9 fathoms. About 3 miles from its southern end, a flat, 1^ miles long with 4\u00a3 fathoms water, rises abruptly from soundings of from 14 to 18 fathoms. There is also a 5-fathoms patch near the northern end of the bank. Another patch, with 9 fathoms water, lies V3 miles northward of Bligh bank, and the soundings for 25. miles N.N.E. and N.E. by N. are irregular, in some places there being only 13 or 14 fathoms ; from whence it follows that the lead is an uncertain guide when approaching the Hinder or Bligh banks from the north-eastward."], [565, "Chap, XL] HINDER, BLIGH, AND THORNTON BANKS. 543 Thornton Ridge.\u2014 Within a depth of 9 fathoms, this sand-bank is 13 miles long E. by N. \\ N. and W. by S. \\ S. with a mean but very varied breadth of 1-^ miles ; it rises from soundings of from 12 to 17 fathoms 14 or 15 miles from the coast of Belgium. A flat, 2\u00a3 miles long and half a mile wide, with from 2 to 3 fathoms water, lies towards the eastern end of the ridge ; the shoalest spot of 2 fathoms bearing N.N.E. 19 miles from Ostende lighthouse. The general depth on the other parts of the ridge is from 6 to 9 fathoms. The land in the neighbourhood of West Kapelle, and the lights of West Kapelle and of Ostende, may be seen from this ridge in clear weather. The western end of Thornton ridge lies S.S.E. 3 miles from the South extreme of Bligh bank, and the space between is the least dangerous channel for large vessels intending to pass betwreen the banks when bound northward from Dunkerque with south-westerly winds. Buoy. \u2014 A red and white chequered buoy with staff and ball is moored in 6 fathoms a short distance north-eastward of the shoal flat ; from it, the Wandelaar light-vessel bears S. by W. 12\u00a3 miles ; and, West Kapelle light S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. 17 miles. It is proposed to supersede this buoy by a somewhat similar one, which will, however, at night show a quick flashing gas light, visible 5 miles. Nearly midway between Bligh bank and Thornton ridge are three narrow shoals occupying a space of 9 miles in an E.N.E. and W.S.W. direction and With from 8 to 9 fathoms water. The western shoal bears E. S. 3\u00a3 miles from the flat on Bligh bank, and N.W. \u00a3 N. 5+ miles from the shoalest spot on Thornton ridge. A succession of shoals, with from 6 to 9 fathoms water, also lie between Thornton ridge and the Out-Ratel, within sight of Ostende light, They occupy a space 10 miles long in an easterly and westerly direction, and the shoalest spot on them, 5^ fathoms, bears N. by E. \\ E. 11 miles from Ostende lighthouse ; none are dangerous, and they are only mentioned here as they may be crossed by vessels coming out of the Zuydcoote Pass and are useful in assuring such that they are in a good and safe track. The COAST. \u2014 The sand-hills forming the coast between Calais and Gravelines may be seen in clear weather at 8 or 9 miles, but some of them are so low that embankments are thrown up as a protection against the sea. The only objects that can be recognised"], [566, "[Chap. XL 544 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. on the level land adjoining the shore are, the two windmills at Walde, Oye church spire, and two windmills standing near Oye village. At low water, the sandy strand extends a mile from the shore between Calais and the meridian of Walde windmills, as well as off the entrance to Gravelines ; but, along the intermediate coast, its breadth varies from half to three quarters of a mile. Depths of less than 4 fathoms adjoining the beach, extend nearly 2 miles from the shore N.N.E. of Calais church and abreast of Gravelines, and about a mile from the shore between Walde and Oye windmills ; between the outer edge of these soundings and high-water mark, the slope of the bottom is steep and somewhat irregular, which tends to cause a heavy sea with on-shore winds. WALDE LIGHT. \u2014 Near the outer edge of the sandy strand which dries at low water, springs, 8 cables from the shore at Walde point, and 3 miles E. by N. \u00a3 N. northerly from Calais lighthouse, is an iron beacon 59 feet high, from whieh, at 34 feet above high water, is exhibited a light showing white and red alternately during twenty seconds, the red flash lasting four seconds, the white flash sixteen seconds, with no eclipse between ; the light is visible in clear weather 11 miles. Telegraph Cable. \u2014 The telegraph cable between France and Denmark (from Calais to Fano island), leaves the shore near the Huttes d'Oye, in longitude 2\u00b0 2' E., and lies in a N. l E. direction for U miles to latitude 51\u00b0 7' 10\" N., and longitude 1\u00b0 59' 39\" E., at which point it takes the direction of N.E. \u00a7 N., passing close westward of No. 7 Out-Ruytingen buoy. The first of these directions is indicated by two beacons on the shore, each surmounted by a hexagonal prism, partly white and partly red. Vessels should not anchor in the direction indicated by these beacons. CAUTION. \u2014 Shipwrecks are frequent between Calais and Grave lines ; they are in great measure attributable to neglect of the lead, and to inattention or want of knowledge as to the times of change of the tidal streams, which are much later at the Galloper light-vessel, from whence vessels from the North Sea usually take their departure, than on the French coast. GRAVELINES.\u2014 The entrance to this small tidal harbour lies 10 miles eastward of Calais, and its position may be easily recognised by the houses of the village of Fort Phillippe built close to the sea"], [567, "Chap. XL] 545 WALDE LIGHT. \u2014 GRAVELINES. on each side of the entrance channel, by a windmill about a quarter of a mile eastward of the village, and by the fine tower of the light house. The port itself is situate under the ramparts of the north western part of the town of Gravelines, at the mouth of the river Aa, but about a mile within the coast-line ; from the offing, however, the town, except the towers of the Cathedral, is hidden from view by trees. About 200 vessels, of which a fair proportion are steamers, enter the port annually bringing about 25,000 tons of merchandise ; the principal imports being wood, coal, woollen goods, bricks, and cement ; the exports, eggs, fruit, vegetables, &c. Vessels are also fitted out for the herring, cod, and mackerel fisheries. The popula tion of the port is about 8,500. The harbour is accessible to vessels of 15 feet draught at high water, springs. At weak springs, those of ll1 or 12 feet can enter it during 5 or 6 days, that is to say, for 2 or 3 days before full and change, and 3 days after. It affords good shelter, at springs, to vessels of about 12 feet draught during westerly gales, especially those between W.S.W. and W.N.W., when the sea is not heavy at the entrance ; but, the bar should be crossed at about high water. In a gale from E.N.E. or East, vessels should run in with the flood, for, after high water, there is some difficulty in stemming the ebb. The tide rises much higher with strong northerly winds, but, as the sea is then very high at the entrance, no vessel drawing more than 12 feet should attempt to enter, unless embayed and with no possibility of reaching Dunkerque road, which is the only place on this coast where, with strong northerly winds, a vessel may find a partially sheltered anchorage. Bar. \u2014 The entrance to the channel leading into Gravelines harbour is frequently obstructed by a bar formed of the sand driven in by westerly winds and sea. The height and extent of this bar depend both on the duration of these winds and on the body of fresh water running out of the harbour. At its medium state, it is from 2 to 3 feet above the level of the fresh water running through the channel when the tide is out, or 5 or 6 feet above the level of the lowest tides. When the great freshets of the river Aa are accompanied by north-easterly winds, it sometimes disappears altogether for several days. The Entrance Channel runs S. by E. \u00a3 E. 2 miles in a direct line from the jetty-heads and consists of two distinct parts, one A. 2771. Wt. 7242. . 2M"], [568, "[Chap. XI. 546 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. bounded by the beach and sands which dry at low water ; the other, by the land from the village of Fort Phillippe to Gravelines. The outer part of the channel, 8 cables long and 305 feet wide at the entrance, is enclosed between two low stone jetties, of which, that on the eastern side does not cover at high water for the greater part of its length from the shore, and is terminated by 330 yards of wooden jetty with a timber pier-head. The stone end of the western jetty is 18 feet above the level of low water, and at high water it is covered throughout but its position is marked by wooden beacons ; the outer beacon off the entrance being larger than those marking the jetty ; these beacons, being secured by strong woodwork, have hitherto served as warping posts for vessels entering, but, to prevent the silting up of the entrance, the western pier is being raised similarly to the eastern one, and this work is near completion. Abreast of the jetty-heads, the level of the fresh water of the river when the tide is out, is 3 feet above the level of low water, extra ordinary springs. The inner part of the channel, between the village of Fort Phillippe and the harbour, is rather more than a mile long and half a cable wide, and is enclosed between embankments which serve for towing paths. The deposit in the channel forms a steep slope on either side, which, in the summer, is partially cleared away by scouring waters released by sluices from the fosses of the fortifications; but, at other seasons, the abundant freshets of the river Aa caused by rain and by the melting of the snow, clear both harbour and entrance channel of the mud and sand which accu mulate in dry weather. The Tidal Harbour is on the north-western side of the town, and is only about 1\u00a3 cables long, occupying half the breadth of the channel by which the course of the Aa has been straightened between the ditches of the western part of the fortifications and the entrance channel. There is a small gridiron and careening place in this harbour where vessels of 150 or 200 tons can be received. The berths of muddy sand, alongside the stone or wooden quays border ing the whole length of the harbour on the town side, are 4| feet above the level of low water, springs. The swell from outside never reaches the tidal harbour. The Wet Dock, or Bassin-a-flot, is 1,082 feet long by 147 feet wide ; it is entered from the tidal harbour by dock gates 32\u00a3 feet wide, and it again communicates with the river Aa, and hence with"], [569, "Chap. XI.] 547 GRAVELINES.\u2014 LIGHTS.\u2014 TIDES. the inland navigation by other flood gates. It is also in communica tion with the railway by means of a siding. The sill at the entrance is on the level of low water, springs ; at high water, springs, there are 18 feet water, and at ordinary neaps, 15 feet over it. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a semaphore station close to the light house. LIGHTS.\u2014 Gravelines Lighthouse, a white circular tower resembling a Doric column, stands at the Eastern side of the entrance, in the western part of the village of Little Fort Phillippe, at 175 yards from the shore, and 65 yards from the eastern bank of the entrance channel. It exhibits, at 95 feet above high water, a fixed white light, dioptric and of the third order, visible at 15 miles. West Jetty. \u2014 A fixed green tidal light, visible 4 miles, is exhibited from iron supports above a shed on the new West jetty head ; this light is 25 feet above high water and is shown from two hours before to two hours after high water. East Jetty. \u2014 A. fixed red light, visible 4 miles, is shown from a similar structure on the East jetty-head ; this light is exhibited all night, and is also 25 feet above high water. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual day tide signals, see page 8, are in use at this port. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Gravelines harbour at noon, springs rise 19 feet, neaps 15 feet. And, above the level of the fresh water stream at the harbour entrance when the tide is out, which is about 3 feet above the level of the lowest tides, equinoctial springs rise 20 feet ; ordinary springs, 18 feet ; ordinary neaps, 12 to 15 feet. A deduction of 2 feet from these heights gives the rise on the bar when in its medium state. Strong winds from N.W. to N.N.W. cause the tide to rise higher, and those from S.E. have a contrary effect. The tide rises slowly for the first three hours, but its rise is rapid from the third to the fourth hour ; it then slacks gradually until high water. At springs, the high water slack in the harbour continues about 15 minutes in calm weather, from 20 to 30 minutes with westerly winds, and 10 minutes at the utmost with off-shore winds ; but, as there is little rise or fall for the last half hour's flood and the first half hour's ebb, there is practically a period of 1\u00a3 hours for moving vessels in and out without danger of grounding. Pilots. \u2014 Eight pilots are stationed at Gravelines ; they cannot get 2M2"], [570, "[Chap. XI. 548 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. out to vessels when the sea is high on the bar, in which case they go as far as they can and wave a flag to indicate the direction in which vessels should steer. A Life-Boat is stationed at Gravelines. A Steam-Tug is stationed at the port and available when required. Directions.\u2014 Vessels arriving off Gravelines harbour some time before the tide serves, may anchor northward of Oye church spire, at 1^ or 2 miles from the shore, in from 5 to 8 fathoms, excellent holding ground ; this anchorage, however, is only safe during fine weather, for the sea is heavy with on-shore winds. The most favourable winds for entering the harbour are those from N.N.W. to N.E., but, if fresh, they cause a high sea at the entrance, and it is then necessary to be quite certain there is sufficient water over the bar to avoid striking. With fresh winds from W.S.W. to W.N.W., the sea is smooth on the bar, but there is some difficulty in getting through the entrance channel when the low part of the jetties are covered, for the flood stream and sea crossing it may drift a vessel on the East jetty. The entrance is easy with north-easterly winds when they are sufficiently strong for a vessel to stem the flood or eastern stream, which is at its greatest strength at the time of high water in the harbour. With a head wind, a vessel is either tracked or towed in. The best time for entering the harbour is about an hour before high water, although the stream at that time runs strongly across the entrance and there is some difficulty in keeping in the deepest parts of the channel ; but, if the vessel takes the ground off Fort Phillippe, with a rising tide, she will float again before high water and get up to the harbour. Bower and stern anchors must be ready to let go, and hawsers to run out, should she be drifted on the East jetty. Sufficient sail should always be carried to ensure good steerage, especially during the autumn and winter months when it often blows fresh in the offing whilst the breeze is light near the shore ; vessels, therefore, under suitable sail in the offing, must be prepared to make more sail as they approach the harbour or they may be in considerable danger in the heavy swell on the bar. In entering the channel with westerly winds, whatever their strength, or with light easterly winds, keep close past the West jetty-head. With fresh easterly winds, run directly for the middle of the entrance."], [571, "Chap. XL] GRAVELINES.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 MARDICK BANK. 549 The COAST. \u2014 From the entrance to Gravelines, that of Dunkerque bears E. \\ S. southerly 10 miles ; the low plain behind the shore between the two places presents no remarkable objects visible from any distance at sea. The only high lands visible in clear weather are, the Great and Little Cassel, two isolated hills S. \\ W. from Dunkerque. The town of Cassel stands on the summit of the Great Cassel ; the other hill is of a conical form The buildings recognisable near the coast are, the tower and light house at Dunkerque, and the church towers of Grande and Petite Synthe and of Mardick. Gravelines point, bearing E. \\ S. southerly 4 miles from Gravelines jetty-heads, is of a rounded form, and the sand-hills com posing it lie in several parallel ridges and are visible in clear weather 9 or 10 miles ; at its outer extreme is a large wooden beacon. A chain of sand-hills covered with verdure extends 2 miles in a W.S.W. direction from the point, and those bordering the shore for about 2 miles eastward are about the same height as those at the point, but, beyond this, and to within a short distance of Dunkerque, they are covered with bent grass and lie in parallel ridges half a mile in the rear of an embankment fronted by low land which covers at high water, springs. Between the entrance of Gravelines and Gravelines point, the sands dry more than half a mile out from the beach, at springs ; abreast of the point, they dry 3 cables ; and, between the point and Dunkerque, 6 or 8 cables. The sand carried eastward by strong westerly winds, is arrested by the' jetties at Dunkerque and accumulates between Mardick and Dunkerque, where it forms an immense heap of which the highest parts barely cover at springs. Of all the obstacles to the improvement of Dunkerque, this high bank of drift sand is the most difficult to combat ; for, drifting over the West jetty, it formerly caused a bank several feet high to form at the jetty-head and across the entrance, and this bank is only kept under by constant dredging assisted by flushings. Mardick Bank, Fosse de Mardick, &c\u2014 The soundings off this part of the coast, within a depth of 5 fathoms, are very irregular and the sea heavy with on-shore winds. Between the entrance to Gravelines and Gravelines point, these soundings extend in places 2 miles and upwards from the shore ; and, on these shallows, the Mardick bank, with a general width of 5 or 6 cables and from 7 to 18 feet water, extends 3| miles parallel with the shore, its western"], [572, "[Chap. XI 550 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. end joining the shore sands about one mile eastward of Gravelines jetties. Another shoal, of which the outer edge is steep-to, joins the strand between Mardick and Dunkerque, and, extending 1\\ miles from the shore, forms, with the Mardick bank, the southern side of the West Pass ; its western end in 3 fathoms is 6 cables eastward of the eastern end of the Mardick bank, and bears N. by W. \\ W. from Mardick church tower. In-shore of this and of the Mardick bank, is the Fosse de Mardick, a deep which has from 19 to 33 feet water but should always be avoided as each end terminates in a blind channel. WEST PASS into DUNKERQUE ROAD.\u2014 From the buoy with bell and reflector, marking the western extreme of the Snouw bank, to abreast of Dunkerque jetty-heads, this pass is 7 miles long, and it lies between the shoal flats joining the shore and the Snouw and Braeck banks. The entrance to it, as well as the direction it follows, is marked by the following buoys : \u2014 A bell buoy with reflector, painted with red and black bands, as described at page 538, is moored at the western extreme of the Snouw at the entrance of the Pass, and must be left on the port hand in entering. On the northern side of the Pass are five black buoys, each with a staff and globe, and all to be left on the port hand in entering : \u2014 No. 1 buoy is moored nearly midway between the buoy with bell and reflector and the Snouw light-vessel. No. 3 buoy is on the southern edge of the Snouw, E. \u00a3 S. If miles from No. 1 buoy, and nearly 1\\ miles E. \\ N. from the Snouw light vessel. No. 5 buoy is 1^ miles E. by S. \\ S. from No. 3. buoy and near the western edge of the Braeck bank ; but, a narrow spit from this bank, with from 17 to 21 feet water, extends half a mile westward from the buoy, and is dangerous to vessels of deep draught running into Dunkerque road with a strong westerly wind, at low water. No. 7 buoy is in 20 feet water on the southern edge of the Braeck bank, about a mile eastward of No. 5 buoy. No. 9 buoy is also on the southern edge of the Braeck bank, about a mile eastward of No. 7 buoy. From it, Dunkerque jetty-heads bear S.E. \u00a3 S. If miles. On the southern side of the West Pass are seven red buoys, each with a staff and cross, moored on the outer edge of the dangerous flats joining the shore, all of which should be left on the starboard hand in entering."], [573, "Chap. XI.] PASSES INTO DUNKERQUE ROAD. 551 No. 2 buoy marks the N.W. edge of Mardick bank, and bears S.W. \u00a3 S. 7 cables from the Dyck light-vessel, and N.E. \u00a3 E. 2 miles from Gravelines jetty-heads. From the buoy, the Snouw bell and reflector buoy bears E. by N. 4. N. 2 miles nearly, and the Snouw light-vessel E. \\ S. 34 miles. A pilot vessel is generally at anchor near this buoy. No. 4 buoy lies on the northern edge of the Mardick bank, about If miles E. f S. from No. 2 buoy, and S. by W. \\ W. 6 cables from the bell and reflector buoy. At this point, the narrows of the West Pass commence. No. 6 buoy is at the north-eastern edge of the Mardick bank, about one mile eastward of No. 4 buoy, and about 6 cables southward of No. 1 black buoy on the opposite side of the Pass. No. 8 buoy marks the north-western edge of the bank next east ward of Mardick bank ; it lies one mile eastward of No. 6 buoy, and S.E. by E. \\ E. about 6 cables from the Snouw light-vessel. No. 10 buoy lies in about 16 feet, If miles E. by S. from No. 8 buoy, and rather less than 5 cables south-westward of No. 5 black buoy on the opposite side of the Pass. No. 12 buoy lies in about 16 feet, If miles eastward of No. 10 buoy, and S. \\ E. less than 5 cables from No. 7 black buoy on the opposite side of the Pass. No. 14 buoy, in about 5 fathoms, is 9 cables eastward of No. 12 buoy ; from it, No. 9 black buoy bears N.N.E. \\ E. 5 cables, and Dunkerque jetty-heads S.E. by E. 1\u00a3 miles. The northern limit of the eastern part of Dunkerque road is marked by two red buoys, Nos. 8 and 6 : No. 8, the western buoy, is moored on the southern edge, near the eastern end, of the Braeck bank, N.E. \\ E. 11 cables from Dunkerque jetty-heads, and E. by S. \u00a3 S. If miles from No. 9 black buoy. No. 6 eastern red buoy is on the southern edge of Hils bank, E. \\ S. 1\u00a3 miles from No. 8 red buoy. ZUYDCOOTE or EAST PASS into DUNKERQUE ROAD. \u2014 This pass is very narrow; it lies between Hils and Traepegeer banks and has from 19 to 22 feet water, see also page 539 ; its limits are defined by one black and two red buoys. No. 2, the northern red buoy, with staff and ball, marks the north eastern edge of Hils bank. No. 4, red buoy is at the south-eastern angle of Hils bank, and, from it, No. 6 red buoy bears W. \\ S. southerly 2\\ miles, the edge of the bank curving southward of this line, midway between the buoys."], [574, "[Chap. XL 552 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. No. 1 black buoy marks the north-western edge of the Traepegeer ; from it, No. 2 red buoy bears W. \u00a3 S. 1\\ miles. Caution. \u2014 The red buoys on the eastern slope of Hils bank, which is very steep, have sometimes drifted across the Zuydcoote Pass to the western slope of the Traepegeer ; this has frequently happened to No. 4 red buoy. Mariners should therefore be on their guard, though the greatest care is taken to keep the buoyage of both Passes in proper condition, a Government steamer being specially assigned for that duty. Directions. \u2014 The general direction through the Zuydcoote Pass from the eastward is about S.W. \\ W., with No. 4 red buoy on the port bow until past No. 2 red buoy, when No. 4 should be brought gradually on the starboard bow ; this leads through in the deepest water. When the flood or eastern stream begins to be felt in Dunkerque road, which is about the time of half flood in the harbour, the tide has risen 9 feet in the Zuydcoote Pass, and the largest vessels that can enter Dunkerque may at that time pass over the south-western end of the Traepegeer by keeping the spires of Bergues church open about a degree westward of Leffrinckoucke church tower bearing about S.S.W. \\ W. If a vessel's draught permits her to turn through the Zuydcoote Pass between half flood and half ebb, the lead must be hove quickly to avoid coming suddenly upon Hils bank ; and, in standing eastward, she should not open the spires of Bergues more than two degrees eastward of Leffrinckoucke church tower. At Night, small vessels entering by this Pass, and unable to distinguish the colour of the first buoy they see, cannot do wrong in passing close eastward of it ; for, if it should be No. 1 black buoy of the Traepegeer, there is enough water for them for 4 cables eastward of it, and if it should be No. 2 red buoy of the Hils bank, by keeping eastward of it they will be in the middle of the Pass. DUNKERQUE ROAD being narrow, and only sheltered by banks of which the greater part are always covered, can only be considered as a temporary anchorage for merchant vessels whose draught permits them to enter the harbour. In heavy weather, sharp vessels deeply laden might be in some danger from the sea, but, with this exception, the pilots consider that a vessel with good ground tackle may ride out a gale from the offing ; and, in the winter of 1870-71, a French squadron remained for many months"], [575, "Chap. XL] 553 DUNKERQUE ROAD. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. in the road and reported favourably of it ; the banks, even at high water, affording sufficient shelter to ships of large size. The road is comprised between the 5-fathoms line in-shore, and the Braeck, Hils, and Traepegeer banks, on the off-shore side. It extends from the western end of the shallow flat of the Braeck, north eastward of Mardick tower, to the entrance of the Zuydcoote Pass, and is separated into two deeps by a sandy bottom 3 cables wide, of which the centre lies N.N.W. \u00a3 W. from Dunkerque lighthouse. There are from 5 to 8 fathoms on this sandy bottom, but the holding ground is bad in the deepest water. The Great road or western deep, with from 8 to 9 fathoms, good holding ground, commences N.E. of Mardick tower, extends to the sandy bottom just mentioned, and is in some degree sheltered from the sea during northerly gales by the high flat on the Braeck bank. It is in this part of the road that vessels of deep draught anchor, with westerly winds and a heavy sea, when they have to wait for high water to enter Dunkerque. Small vessels under similiar circum stances may anchor N.W. about a mile from the harbour entrance, in the southern part of the sandy bottom, the holding ground there being good and the depth from 5 to 7 fathoms : this is also a good position for all vessels with off-shore winds. The Little road or eastern deep commences with Heuguenar towTer on with Dunkerque lighthouse, and extends to the Zuydcoote Pass ; in it, the depths vary from 8 to 11 fathoms, and the holding ground is good, especially N.N.E. of Dunkerque. Large vessels remaining some time in Dunkerque road should anchor in this deep between the lines of Heuguenar tower touching the eastern side of the light house, and the same tower on with Dunkerque tower ; here they are better sheltered than in the western deep during gales from N.N.W. to E.N.E. by the high flats on Braeck and Hils bank ; and, in the event of parting, it is much less dangerous to run ashore eastward than westward of Dunkerque. In any part of the road, vessels should have a spare anchor ready if the wind veers and threatens to blow hard from the northward. Tidal Streams. \u2014 The first of the flood stream in Dunkerque road comes from N.N.W. ; as it gains strength it turns more eastward, and, at its greatest speed, which lasts about two hours, it runs straight through the road. It then decreases rapidly, and, after a few minutes slack water, the ebb stream commences, running N.N.W. at first, and, as its rate increases, turning westward, and running parallel with the coast when at its greatest strength ; towards"], [576, "554 [Chap. XL CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. the end of the tide, its direction is W.S.W. and S.S.W. The flood or eastern stream runs for 2\u00a3 or 3 hours after high water in the harbour ; see tides, page 557. DUNKERQUE, 10 miles eastward of Gravelines, formerly an arsenal and naval port, is now the principal French commercial port in the North Sea. The town stands at the junction of the Bergues, Bourbourg, and Fumes canals, and the public buildings are spacious, handsome, and regular. As this port is one principal outlet for the great manufacturing Departement du Nord, the trade by sea is very large. The cod and herring fisheries are also carried on with great activity. The average of the six years, 1882-87, shows that the trade of the port is represented by 2,669 vessels entering annually, their aggregate tonnage being 1,052,632 tons. The population in 1886 amounted to 39,195. There is a town hospital at which foreign sailors are received at two francs per diem; cases of small-pox or typhoid are sent to the Lazaret, where the charges are much higher. There is also a Sailor's Home and British Seamen's Institute. The principal imports, to the amount of over 1,200,000 tons annually, are, ores, coal, cereals, seeds, molasses, nitrate of soda, wood, wool, flax, petroleum, jute, and pig iron. The exports, about 180,000 tons annually, are principally coal, forage, potash, rails, and casks. Dunkerque is in railway communication with all parts of France and the Continent, and through Fumes with Belgium. The telegraph service is also very good. By sea, there is regular steam service to London, Hull, Goole, Leith, Rotterdam, St. Petersburgh, Havre, Bordeaux, and Marseilles. The port consists of an entrance channel leading to an outer tidal harbour, at the end of which is an inner tidal harbour and four wet docks or basins. Great improvements have been effected in the entrance and tidal harbours of late years by dredging and other wise, and extensive harbour works are still (1888) in progress. In addition to the present wet docks, others with an area of 47 acres are either under construction or projected, as well as four dry docks, of which two, not yet completed, are 360 feet in length, and will take vessels up to 328 feet on the keel. There are building yards where fishing craft of from 30 to 150 tons are built, and also vessels up to 800 tons for the foreign and coasting trade. Steam coal is always plentiful and moderate in price, that of French coal delivered on board being about 14s. per ton. Vessels usually coal in the Basins ; if they coal alongside the wharf in the tidal harbour, they lie aground in about 4 feet at low water. All necessary supplies"], [577, "Chap. XL] DUNKERQUE. \u2014 ENTRANCE CHANNEL. 555 for shipping are readily obtainable, but moderate repairs only to hull or machinery can be effected until one of the dry docks is completed, though there is a patent slip capable of receiving vessels up to 1,000 tons, as well as a large gridiron. Vessels drawing from 19 to 22, or even 23, feet can enter the port at high water, springs ; but, for three or four days after each quarter, about 4 feet must be deducted from that draught. Northerly gales cause such a high sea outside the jetties that vessels above 14 feet draught should not attempt to run in at such times unless the pilots judge the entrance practicable ; small vessels may enter at the top of high water by carrying all possible sail to get through the heavy sea, but, at neaps, the entrance is inaccessible during these gales to all except coasters. The Entrance Channel is about one mile long N.N.W. and S.S.E., and 230 feet wide ; it is enclosed partly by the citadel quay and the extension of the town quay as far as the Cunette sluice, and partly between wooden jetties extending across the sands which uncover at low water. The sand forces itself into the channel through the openings in the pilework and through the entrance, especially during dry weather and at neaps. Water from the canals of the interior and from the ditches of the town, is used to scour the harbour and entrance channel, but, although the stream is rapid, it has so far to run that its effect does not extend much beyond the jetty-heads, and does not suffice to keep the entrance clear. Constant dredging by steam dredges of peculiar construction, however, in conjunction with flushing, enables the harbour authorities to maintain a depth both within and outside the jetties of at least 5 feet water at the lowest tides. During rainy weather, and at the melting of the snow, when the water in the interior is abundant, the stream runs strongly out of the channel all the time the flood is weak and is checked only when the tide rises rapidly ; it recovers its course as soon as the tide slacks, about half an hour before high water, and as soon as the ebb makes it acquires great strength. This stream causes very little in convenience to vessels of deep draught entering before high water, but, as soon as the tide begins to fall, they must have a strong fair wind to get through against it. Vessels lying anywhere in the inner parts of the channel, require to be well secured in strong northerly winds, when the swell makes itself felt both in the entrance channel and outer tidal harbour. The Outer Tidal Harbour occupies the space between the"], [578, "556 [Chap. XL CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. town and the citadel, is about 3 cables long, from 400 to 500 feet wide, and surrounded by quays where several lines of steamers have their regular berths. It dries at springs, and the bottom is a mixture of sand, shingle, and mud, vessels lying alongside the quays on a much thicker bottom of mud than in the inner tidal harbour. Strong northerly winds cause the swell to enter this harbour for about 2 or 3 hours each tide, but it does not inconvenience a vessel well secured. The Inner Tidal Harbour communicates directly with the outer harbour and dries at low water ; it is bordered by quays, partly of stone and partly pile fronted. On its southern side are building yards, and the entrances to the wet docks are from this harbour. Wet Docks. \u2014 The four wet docks, or bassins-a-flot, are named respectively, the Bassin Freycinet, du Commerce, de la Marine, and de l'Arriere Port. The Bassin Freycinet, or de l'Ouest, has an area of 19| acres, and an entrance lock 394 feet long and 66 feet broad, with a depth over the sill at high water, springs, of 24 feet 5 inches. This basin has quays only on the side near the town, the other side being merely embankments through which will be the openings to the large new basins under construction. Improved connection with the canal system of the interior by means of two locks is also being completed . The Bassin du Commerce, of 13^ acres area, communicates with the inner tidal harbour, and also with the Bassin de la Marine, by lock gates, and directly with the Bassin de l'Arriere Port. It has good stone quays on its eastern and western sides. The Bassin de la Marine, of 1\\ acres area, is surrounded by quays, and the Bassin de l'Arriere Port, of 6 acres, has a wooden quay on its western side. The depth over the sills of the Bassin du Commerce, de la Marine, and de l'Arriere Port, is in each case about 20 feet 9 inches at high water, springs ; and 17 feet 6 inches at neaps. The largest vessel yet admitted to any of the docks was a steamer of 2,550 tons, and 23 feet 3 inches draught of water.

East Jetty-head. \u2014 A fixed green light is shown from the extreme of the East jetty at 26 feet above high water, and is visible 4 miles. Tidal Light. \u2014 West jetty. \u2014 From a white tower 49 feet within the West jetty-head, at 33 feet above the sea, is exhibited a tidal light, visible 9 miles, varying in colour, and indicating by colour and flashes the state of the tide, every 10 inches of rise above a depth of 6^ feet being shown, thus : \u2014 When the tide is less than 6| feet above low water, springs, and rising, the light shows red; when less than 6^ feet and falling, the light shows green ; when between 6 \\ and 7^ feet the light shows ivhite. With 7^ feet and upwards, the light shows white with groups of coloured flashes at intervals of eighty seconds. The flashes in each group are shown at intervals of five seconds, each red flash adding 3 feet 4 inches to the initial height of 6^ feet, and each green flash 10 inches more. With a rising tide, the fixed light, whether red or white, is eclipsed for a short period every eighty seconds ; and, with a falling tide, the fixed light, ivhite or green, is eclipsed twice in quick succession during the same period. At or near high water, the light is not eclipsed. When the fixed white light is varied by groups of coloured flashes, the eclipses take place about the middle of the interval separating the groups. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Dunkerque, at Oh. 8m. ; springs rise 16\u00a3 feet, neaps 13^ feet ; and, 6 feet added to the rise gives about the average depth at high water throughout the entrance channel. Strong northerly winds raise the tide 2 or 3 feet higher, but the sea is then heavy at the entrance. When easterly winds prevail, springs do not rise much higher than neaps with fresh westerly winds. In the harbour, in calm weather, high water slack lasts about 15 minutes ; with westerly winds, 20 or 25 minutes ; and, with off-shore winds, 10 minutes. A short distance outside the jetties, the flood or eastern stream runs 2\u00a3 or 3 hours after high water in the harbour."], [580, "558 [Chap. XI. CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. Tide Signals. \u2014 The day tide signals are those in use at all French ports, see page 8. They are made from a flagstaff on the terrace of a little building S.S.E. 109 yards from Dunkerque light hours, between the West jetty and Fort Risban. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station at Dunkerque : it is just in front of the lighthouse. Pilots. \u2014 There are 36 qualified pilots at Dunkerque, they are unable to get out of harbour when there is a heavy sea at the entrance, which is frequently the case ; but, three pilot vessels are always cruising at sea. Their stations are, one between Dungeness and the Downs, another near the Ruytingen light-vessel, and a third near the Dyck light-vessel. They all have the word Dunkerque in large black letters on their sail and a large black anchor beneath that word. They always endeavour to meet large vessels, but small ones requiring a pilot should make the signal directly they sight a pilot vessel. Steam-Tugs. \u2014 The port is well supplied with steam-tugs, whose services are always available. A Life-Boat is stationed at Dunkerque. DIRECTIONS\u2014 From the Westward.\u2014 With the wind from N.N.W. round by West to S.S.W., vessels should endeavour to make the land about cape Grisnez, and, from about 2 miles north-westward of that cape, steer N.E. by E. \\ E. 10 miles, or until Mont Couple bears about S.S.W. and the entrance to Calais S.E. From thence, the course to the Dyck light-vessel, at the entrance of the West Pass into Dunkerque road, is E. \\ S. southerly 15\u00a3 miles; this leads about 8 cables northward of the red perch and globe buoy marking the Ridin de Calais. In approaching the West Pass, bring the Dyck and Snouw light vessels in line E. by S. \u00a3 S., and steer for them ; keep southward of both light-vessels and of the red and black bell buoy with reflector in passing them, and then with the light-vessels in line astern W. by N. 4. N., run in, leaving all black buoys on the port hand and red buoys on the starboard hand up to Dunkerque Great road ; but, if proceeding east ward beyond the entrance of the harbour to the Little road, it must be bome in mind that the colour of the buoys is reversed, red buoys marking that road on the port hand, if coming from the westward. Vessels of deep draught running in with a strong westerly wind, at"], [581, "Chap, xl] 559 DUNKERQUE. \u2014 PILOTS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. low water, should avoid the 21-feet spit which extends 5 cables westward of No. 5 black buoy, by keeping over towards No. 10 red buoy in this part of the Pass. Large vessels, having to wait for high water to enter Dunkerque, anchor in the Pass between Nos. 7 and 9 black buoys. With the wind between N.N.E. and E.N.E., long boards should be made in the Pas de Calais until Calais bears S.S.E. -^ E., when a vessel should stand in for the land, keeping the lead going quickly to avoid crossing the Ridin de Calais. Boards of about 3 miles may be made between the West Dyck and the 5-fathoms edge of soundings towards the shore, but, from the meridian of Gravelines lighthouse to the entrance of the West Pass, short tacks should be made near the edge of these soundings, bearings of the Dyck and Snouw light vessels enabling this to be done with great confidence. At Night, with westerly winds, after running past cape Grisnez as directed, until Calais light bears S.E. \\ S. and cape Grisnez light S.W. \\ W. westerly, steer E. \\ S. for the Dyck light-vessel ; the Snouw light-vessel will be sighted shortly after the Dyck, then steer for them in line bearing E. by S. \\ S., and, passing close south ward of both bring them in line astern, and so run on through Dunkerque road, anchoring in about 8 fathoms, with Heuguenar tower light seen between the two jetty lights S.S.E. From the Northward. \u2014 When bound from the North Sea to Dunkerque, or other French ports on this coast, endeavour to make the land about cape Blanc-Nez whatever the direction of wind or time of tide. The land south-westward of this cape, as far as cape Grisnez, may be seen in ordinary weather about 18 miles, and Mont Couple and the hills around it, 22 or 23 miles. The course from about 3 or 4 miles eastward of the Galloper light-vessel is S.S.W. \\ W. ; this leads eastward of the Four-mile knolls or North Falls Head, and when the North Foreland lighthouse bears W. by N. \\ N., steer S.W. \\ S. to pass midway between the Falls Tail and the south-western end of the Sandettie bank. In clear weather, there is no difficulty in turning to windward over this ground ; when thick or foggy, the lead must be kept going quickly to avoid standing into less than 20 fathoms. From a well defined position, ships may pass between the Great and Little banks of Out-Ruytingen by steering for Gravelines light house bearing S. by E. \u00a3 E. easterly, and taking great care to main tain that bearing ; the least water in this route is 7>\\ fathoms, on"], [582, "[Chap. XI. 560 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. crossing the West Dyck bank. On bringing the Dyck and Snouw light-vessels in line, proceed as before directed for Dunkerque roads. The same routes may be safely taken at night when the lights are distinctly seen. At Night, the lights at the South Foreland, cape Griznez, Calais, and even Dunkerque, may be seen in clear weather when a vessel is midway between the Falls Tail and the south-western end of the Sandettie ; from this position, if the wind is from the eastward, Calais light may be steered for, or, if from the westward, the land between Calais and cape Grisnez ; but, to keep a safe distance from the coast on either of these courses, it is necessary in the former case not to bring cape Grisnez light westward of S.W. by W., nor Gravelines light eastward of S.E. by E. \\ E. ; and, in the latter, not to bring cape Grisnez light westward of S.W. \\ W., nor Calais light eastward of S.E. by S. Having attained either of the positions indicated by these bearings, the Dyck light-vessel and Dunkerque road may be steered for as before directed from the westward. With strong northerly winds, it is not prudent to approach within 5 miles of the coast, nor to bring Gravelines light eastward of S.E. by E. With strong westerly winds, vessels sometimes pass westward of the Galloper and the Falls, or between the Galloper and Four-mile knolls and then westward of the Falls, in order to get smoother water. The course from about 2 miles westward of the Galloper is S.W. \\ S., and a run of about 34 miles on that course brings the vessel up to the East Goodwin light-vessel and well southward of the Falls Tail ; both cape Grisnez and Calais lights will then be in sight if the weather is clear. Entering Dunkerque. \u2014 Have good hawsers ready to moor head and stern, anchors clear, and, with a fair wind, a heavy anchor ready to bring up by the stern. All possible sail should be carried to pass quickly through the breakers at the entrance, where fresh northerly winds raise a heavy sea, and the best time then for running in, is, at high water. When within the entrance channel there is no difficulty in reaching the harbour. Strong winds between N.W. and S.S.W. cause a heavy swell at the entrance. At such times, keep close to the West jetty -head and western side of the channel until sheltered by that part of the jetty which is boarded up, as the flood or eastern stream setting through the open pilework runs with great rapidity towards the East jetty."], [583, "Chap. XL] 561 DUNKERQUE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. This stream, as before explained, is at its greatest strength about half an hour before high water in the harbour. With moderate westerly winds, the most favourable time to enter, if a vessel's draught permits, is, when the stream slackens, or about half or three quarters of an hour after high water in the harbour. Strong easterly winds also raise a high sea at the entrance on a weather tide ; with these winds, steer for the East jetty-head, and then run along the eastern side of the channel. When it blows hard between S.S.W. and S.S.E., vessels cannot enter under sail and the services of a steam-tug are requisite ; but, if preferred, as the sea is then smooth in the road, they may remain there without danger. During light winds, every effort should be made to close with the West jetty-head to avoid being drifted eastward of the entrance by the flood stream, which runs at its greatest strength outside the jetties the whole of the time large vessels can enter. The best time for those of light draught to run in, is, directly the signal shows sufficient water and before the flood has attained much strength. Leaving Dunkerque. \u2014 Sailing vessels bound westward or to the northern ports of the North Sea, either wait for favourable winds or are towed out to positions from which to make sail. The gates of the wet docks are opened one hour before and closed about half an hour after high water. Winds with southing in them are the most favourable for leaving, but on-shore winds, when strong, forbid all egress. If bound westward, vessels should leave the harbour directly they float if the wind is sufficiently strong to stem the flood stream ; but, with a light wind, they should not start until near the top of high water, and then anchor in the road for the stream to slacken. On quitting the West Pass, steer with the Dyck and Snouw light -vessels in line astern, and then, a W. \u00a3 N. course leads northward of the Ridin de Calais ; and, when Calais lighthouse bears S.E. \u00a3 S., or cape Grisnez lighthouse S.W. \u00a3 W., a S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. course leads a safe distance westward of that cape. If bound northward, and the vessel's draught permits her crossing the banks northward of Dunkerque, the entrance channel should be left as early as possible before high water ; but, this passage should never be attempted without a fresh fair wind to enable her to run quickly over the banks, and it must be borne in mind that there may be quite 4 feet less water in crossing the Braeck bank than in the entrance channel. When clear of the jetties, steer N. \u00a3 W. to get the spire at Petite Synthe on with the guard-house about a A. 2771. Wt. 17197. 2 N"], [584, "562 [Chap. XL CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. mile westward of Dunkerque lighthouse S.W. \u00a3 S. ; then steer N.E. \u00a3 N. with this mark on, crossing in succession the Braeck, Smal, and East Breedt banks, until the lead shows that the vessel is near the eastern edge of the East Dyck bank, when a N.E. by E. course for 35 miles leads between Thornton ridge and Bligh bank. The soundings on this latter course are from 14 to 19 fathoms. A cast of 9 or 10 fathoms may be had on the two narrow shoals between Thornton ridge and Bligh bank. If the vessel's draught does not permit of her crossing these banks, leave the harbour as soon as she floats so as to get the full benefit of the eastern stream, and, when outside the jetties, steer through the Zuydcoote pass ; see page 551. When clear of the Pass, steer E.N.E. through the West deep until Furnes is on with Broers-Duyn, see next paragraph, bearing South, when the vessel will be crossing the narrow shoal joining the Smal and Nieuport banks. From thence, a N.E. \\ N. course for 35 miles leads through the North channel and clear of all the banks. The only inconvenience in following this course is, the crossing of the tidal stream in an oblique direction, which must be allowed for. Ostende light may be seen in ordinary weather until within 2 miles of the southern part of Thornton ridge. THE COAST.\u2014 From Dunkerque to the frontier of Belgium, 7 miles distant, and for 25 miles beyond it as far as Blankenberg, the coast trends nearly in a straight line E. by N. \\ N. The shore being low, sandy, and bordered by sand-hills, has a dull uniform appearance, the only objects that can be recognized on the level plain in the interior being the clumps of trees surrounding villages, church towers, and windmills. Between Dunkerque and the frontier a large beacon named the Pilot's mast, and some revenue guard houses, may be seen on the sand-hills near the shore, and the old ruined tower, known as Sables tower, amongst the sand-hills near Zuydcoote ; and, beyond the frontier, the towers of Furnes, the ramparts and church tower of Nieuport, and the Broers-Duyn, a high sand-hill bearing North from Furnes, which is flattened at the summit and may be easily recognized at sea by its being totally free from verdure, whilst those near it are of a brown colour and covered with bent grass. The sandy strand bordering the coast abreast of Dunkerque Little Road, dries a quarter of a mile out from the shore at low water, and the depths outside it increase gradually to 1\\ fathoms at a mile from the shore. To ground in bad weather on this part of"], [585, "Chap. XL] 563 THE COAST. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. the coast on a falling tide is less fatal than on the beach between Dunkerque and Mardick, for, whatever the violence of wind and surf, if a vessel runs stem on to the beach she makes a bed in the sand and the tide soon leaves her, especially if she takes the ground about half an hour after high water, at springs. Assistance can then be afforded to the crew and they may be saved if they remain on board until the tide has left her ; whereas a vessel grounding on the high beach westward of Dunkerque, almost always becomes a total wreck, often with loss of crew, at whatever time of tide she runs ashore. TIDES AND TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 On the northern coast of France, as well as on the English shore from Dover to the North Foreland, the tide, at springs, takes 5\u00a3 hours to rise from the level of low water to that of high water, and 7^ hours to fall from that level to low water ; but these durations vary according to the moon's age ; that of the flood increases progressively from full or change to the following quarter, whilst that of the ebb decreases, so that two or three days after the quarter, the duration of the ebb is as long as the flood ; it then increases gradually until the following full or change, and that of the flood decreases. In calm weather, both streams in the offing have respectively about the same duration as the rising and falling tide on the shore, and their rate is in proportion to the range of tide ; the times of the change of stream, however, do not coincide with the times of high and low water by the shore. The flood or eastern stream is generally less rapid than the ebb, but the rate and duration of both are influenced by the winds. It has not yet been ascertained by any decisive experiments whether the range of the tides between the northern coast of France and the estuary of the Thames is equal to that observed on the surrounding shores. All that is positively known on the subject is, that as far as 15 or 16 miles from the French coast, the vertical motion of the tides seems to follow very nearly the same law as on the shore ; they take place at the same times and appear to rise in an equal degree ; but, if the rise of water, at springs, on this coast, at Calais for example, is compared with that observed at the same tides on the coasts of Holland and Belgium, as well as at several positions in the estuary of the Thames, and especially at Orfordness, it would appear that beyond the distance of 15 or 16 miles from the French coast, in a N.N.E. and E.N.E. direction, the range of tide decreases in the same manner as on the shores. It is even probable that this 2 N 2"], [586, "[Chap. XL 564 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. decrease is very rapid, for, in the middle of the North sea, between Holland and England, there are not more than 2 feet difference between high and low water ; the mariner, therefore, in determining his position by the depths on the chart, should diminish the allowance required for rise of tide according to his distance from the nearest shore. The tides on the coasts of France, Belgium, and Holland, as well as on the coast of England from Dover to the North Foreland, are chiefly affected by the tidal wave which traverses in about 8 hours the whole extent of the English channel. The flood or eastern stream, when at its greatest strength, takes an E.N.E. course, and its direction is only changed near the shore by the bends of the coast. The tides on the English coast, northward of the North Foreland, are produced by a similar tidal wave, which, after having doubled the northern extreme of the British islands, extends southward along the eastern coasts of Scotland and England and runs directly towards the estuary of the Thames. The flood or southern stream, when at its greatest strength, runs parallel with the English coast, but when it has reached the parallel of Orfordness, and the Thames opens out, it turns to W.S.W. in an opposite direction to that which the flood stream follows near the coast of France. But, as the changes of stream in the offing occur later than near the shore, in proportion to the distance from the land, the stream of flood on the French coast evidently mingles with the ebb stream from the mouth of the Thames, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Gabbard and Galloper banks. CAUTION. \u2014 Mariners should bear in mind that the direction of the tidal stream in the offing, either in the North sea or Channel, is not to be taken as a sign of the rise or fall of the tide ; for, a vessel would be exposed to the greatest danger if she ran with the flood stream towards a shoal lying far from the land, under the idea that in consequence of the direction of the stream the water was rising on that shoal, and that she might venture to cross it. The flood stream only ceases to be felt in the vicinity of some of those banks which are farthest out from the coasts of France and Belgium, when it is nearly low water on the shore. When desirous of crossing a bank lying within 15 or 16 miles of the French coast, an approximate calculation should always be made of the number of feet the tide has risen above the soundings shown on the chart."], [587, "Chap.
