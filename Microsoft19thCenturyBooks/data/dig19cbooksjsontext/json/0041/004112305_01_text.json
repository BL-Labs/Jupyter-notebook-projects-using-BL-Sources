IN WHICH THEKE IS MORE ALE THAN ARGUMENT. It was on a blusterous windy night in the early part of November, iSir_, that three men were on the high road near little village of Grassford, in the south of Devonshire. The moon was nearly at the full, but the wild scud, and occasionally the more opaque clouds, passed over it in such rapid succession, that it was rarely, and but for a moment or two, that the land scape was thrown into hght and shadow; and the wind, which w7as keen and pierc ing, bent and waved the leafless branches of the trees which were ranged along the hedgerows, between which the road had been so The three individuals to whom we have referred, appeared all of them to have been indulging too freely in the ale which was sold at the public-house about half a mile from the village, and from which they had just departed. Two of them, however, comparatively speaking, sober, were assist- ing home, by their joint efforts, the third, who, supported between them, could with difficulty use his legs. Thus did they con- tinue or. ; the two swayed first on the one side of the road and then on the other by the weight of the third, whom they almost carried between them. At last they arrived at a bridge built over one of those im- petuous streams so common in (lie county, when, as if by mutual understanding, for it hout speaking, the two more sober deposited the body of the third against the parapet of the bridge, and then for some .vere silently occupied in recovering breath.' One of the two who re- mained leaning on the parapet by the side of the.r almost lifeless companion was a man of about forty years of age, tall and slender, dressed in a worn-out black coat, and a pair of trousers much too short for lie original colour of which it would Seen difficult to have surmised ; a sort of clerical hat, equally the worse for wear, was on his head. Although his habiliments were mean, still tlie-re was something about his appearance which told of better days, and of having moved in a different sphere in society, and such had been the case. Some years before he had been the head of a\" grammar school with a comfortable income, but a habit of drink- ing had been his ruin ; and he was now the preceptor of the village of Grassford, and gained his livelihood by instructing the children of the cottagers for the small modicum of twopence a heaa per week. unfortunate propensity to liquor re- mained with him ; and he no sooner re- ceived his weekly stipend than he hastened to drown his cares, and the recollection of his former position, at the ale-house they had just quitted. The second per- sonage whom we shall introduce, was not of a corresponding height with me other ; he was broad, square-chested, and short \u2014 dressed in knee-bteeches, legging., and laced boots \u2014 his coat being of a thick fustian, and cut short like a shooting jacket ; his profession was that of a pedlar. \"It's odd to me,\" said the pedlar, at last breaking silence as he looked down upon the drunken man who lay at his feet, \"why ale should take a man off his legs ; they say that liquor gets into the head, not the i \" Well ! \" replied the schoolmaster, who was much more inebriated than the pedlar, \" there's argument even in that ; and, you see, the perpendicular deviation must arise from the head being too heavy \u2014 that's clear ; and then, you see, the sect, from the centre of gravity being destroyed, become too tight ; and ii\" you put that and that to- gether, why, a man can't stand \u2014 you under- stand my demonstration.\" \" It was heavy wet, that ale, and so I suppose it's all right,\" replied the pedlar ; \" but still ale an't poured into the head or into the feet of a man, but into the internals, are right in the middle of a man \u2014 so, how do you make out your case, Mr. Furness ? \" 71 Why I Byres, you talk of the re siduum.\" \" Never said a word about it ; and, as"], [18, "THE POACHER. 2 I stand here, never even heard the word before.\" \" Perhaps not ; the residuum is, you see, Byres, what is left.\" \"If that's residguim, I didn't mean to say a word about it \u2014 there was none left, for you drained the pot.\" \"Good Byre?, you have never been to college, that's clear. Now, observe, when a man pours down into his stomach a cer tain quantify of liquor, the spirituous or lighter part ascends to his head, and that makes his head heavy. Do you under stand? \" \"No; what's light can't make things heavy.\" \" Can't it? \u2014 you know nothing about the matter. Have you not a proof before you ? \" replied the schoolmaster, reeling and catch ing hold of the parapet for support. ' ' Look at that unfortunate man, who has yielded to excess.\" \" Very true ! I see that he's drunk, but 1 want to know how it is that he got drunk? \" \" By drinking.\" \" That I knew before.\" \"Then why ask any more questions? Had we not better proceed, and take him home to his expectant and unhappy wife? \"Tis a sad, sad thing, that a man should ' put an enemy into his mouth to steal away his brains.' \" \" Half a pint will do that with Rush brook,\" replied the pedlar ; \"theysaythat he was wounded on his head, and that half his brains are gone already, and that's why he has a pension.\" \"Yes, seventeen pounds a-year; paid quarterly, without deduction, and only to walk four miles to get it,\" replied Furness ; \"yet how misplaced is the liberality on the part of the government. Does he work? No ; he does nothing but drink and lie in bed all day, while I must be up early and remain late, teaching the young idea at two pence per week. Friend Byres, ' mercy is not itself which oft looks so.' Now, it is my opinion that it would be a kindness to this poor wretch if we were to toss him, as he now is, over the bridge into the rushing stream \u2014 it would end all his troubles.\" \" And save us the trouble of getting him home,\" replied Byres, who determin humour his more inebriated companion. \"Well, Mr. Furness, I've no objection. Why should he live? Is he not asinecurist \u2014 one of the locusts who fatten on the sweat and blond of the people, as the Sunday paper says? don't you remember my read ing it this morning? \" \" Very true, Master Furness ; what d'ye say then ? shall we ovtr with him ?\" \"We must think a little,\" replied the schoolmaster, who put his hand up to his chin, and remained silent for a minute or two. \"No,\" resumed he at last, \"on second thoughts I cannot do it. He halves his beer with me. No pension \u2014 no that's a self-evident proposition and con clusion. It were ingratitude on my part, and I cannot consent to your proposal,' continued the schoolmaster; \"nay, more, I will defend him against your murderous intentions to the very last.\" \"Why, Master Furness, you must be somewhat the worse for liquor yourself ; it was your proposal to throw him over the bridge, not mine.\" \" Take care what you say,\" replied the schoolmaster; \"would you accuse me of murder or intent to murder? \" \" No, not by no means \u2014 only you pro posed heaving him over the bridge ; I will say that.\" \" Friend Byres, it's my opinion you'll say anything but your prayers ; but in your present state I overlook it Let us go on, or I shall have two men to carry home instead of one. Come, now, take one of his arms, while 1 take the other, and raise him up. It is but a quarter of a mile to the cottage.\" Byres, who, as we observed, was by far the most sober of the two, did not think it worth while to reply to the pedagogue. After a few staggers on the part of the latter, their comrade was raised up and led away between them. The drunken man appeared to be so far aware of what was going on that he moved his legs mechanically, and in a short time they arrived at the cottage door, which the pedagogue struck with his fist so as to make it rattle on its hinges. The door was opened by a tall handsome woman, hold ing a candle in her hand. \" I thought so,\" said she, shaking her head, \"the old story; now, he will be ill all night, and not get up till noon. What a weary life it is with a drunken husband. Bring him in, and thank you kindly for your trouble.\" \" It has been hard work and hot work,\" observed the schoolmaster, sitting down in a chair, after they had placed their comrade on the bed. \" Indeed, and it must be,\" replied the wife. \" Will you have a drop of small beer, Mr. Furness?\" \"Yes, if you please, and so will Mr. Byres too. What a pity it is your good man will not keep to small beer.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" replied the wife who went into the back premises, and soon returned with a quart mug of beer."], [19, "THE POACHER. 3 The schoolmaster emptied half the mug, and then handed it to the pedlar. \" And my little friend Joey, fast asleep, I'll warrant\" \"Yes, poor child, and so should I have been by this time ; the clock has gone twelve.\" \"Well, Mrs. Rushbrook, I wish you a good night Come, Mr. Byres, Mrs, Rushbrook must want to be in bed. \" \"Good night, Mr. Furness, and good night, sir, and many thanks.\" The schoolmaster and pedlar quitted the cottage. Mrs. Rushbrook, after hav ing watched them for a minute, carefully closed the door. \"They're gone now,\" said she, as she returned to her husband. What would have created much aston ishment could anybody else have witnessed it, as soon as his wife had spoken, Rush brook immediately sprung upon his feet, a sine-looking man, six sect in height, very erect in his bearing, \u2014 and proved to be perfectly sober. \"Jane, my dear,\" said he, \" there never was such a night ; but I must be quick, and lose no time. Is my gun ready ? \" \" Everything's ready ; Joey is lying down on his bed, but all ready dressed, and he awakes in a minute,\" \" Call him, then, for there is no time to lose. That drunken fool, Furness, pro posed throwing me over the bridge. It was lucky for them that they did not try it, or I should have been obliged to settle them both, that they might tell no tales. \"Where's Mum ?\" \" In the washhouse. I'll bring him and Joey directly.\" The wife left the room, while Rushbrook took down his gun and ammunition, and prepared himself for his expedition. In a minute or two a shepherd's dog, which had been released from the washhouse, made his ince, and quietly lay down close to his master's feet ; it was soon followed by Mrs. R., accompanied by Joey, a thin meagre-looking boy of about twelve years old, very small for his age, but apparently as active as a cat, and with energy corre sponding. No one would have thought he had been roused from his sleep ; there was no yawning or weariness of motion \u2014 on the contrary, his large eye was as bright as an eagle's, as he quietly although quickly pro- ; himself with a sack, which he threw over his shoulders, and a coil of line, which he held in uting until his father was ready to start. The wife put out the lights, softly opened the cottage-door, looked well round, and then returned to her husband, who, gb'ing a low whisde as a summons to Joey and the dog, walked out of the door. Not a word was spoken \u2014 the door was softly shut to \u2014 and the trio crept stealthily awa y. CHAPTER II. IN WHICH THE HERO OF THE TALE IS \\LLY INTRODUCED. Before we proceed with our narrative, perhaps it will be better to explain what may appear very strange to the reader. Joseph Rushbrook, who has just left the cottage with his son and his dog, was born in the village in which he was then resid ing. During his younger days, some forty years previous to his present introduction to the reader, the law was not so severe or the measures taken against poachers so strong as they were at the period of which we write. In Ms youth he had been very fond of carry ing a gun \u2014 as his father had been before him \u2014 but he never was discovered ; and after having poached for many years and gained a perfect knowledge of the country for miles round, he was persuaded, in a fit of semi-intoxication, at a neighbouring fair, to enlist in a marching regiment. He had not been more than th*-ee months at the dep6t when he was ordered out to India, where he remained eleven years be fore he was recalled. He had scarcely been six months in England when the exigency of the war demanded the services of the regiment in the Mediterranean, where he remained for twelve years, and having received a severe wound in the head, he was then pensioned off and discharged. He resolved to return to his native village, and settle down quietly, hoping by moderate labour and his pension to gain a comfor. able living. On his return he was hardly known ; many had emigrated to a foreign clime; many had been transported for offences against the laws, particularly for the offence of poaching, and as rao.t of his former allies had been so emploved, he found himself almost a stranger where he expected to meet with frit-nds. The pro perty also about the village had changed hands. People recollected Squire So and So, and the Baronet, but now their lands were held by wealthly manufacturers or retired merchants. AU was new to Joe Rushbrook, and he felt himself anywhere but at home. Jane Ashley, a very beau tiful young woman who was in service at the Hall, the mansion appertaining to the adjacent property, and the daughter of one of his e uhest friends who had been transported for poaching, was almost th-j only one who could ta k to him after"], [20, "4 THE POACHER. his absence of twenty-four years ; not that she knew the people at the time, for she was then an infant, but she had grown up with them after Joe had left, and could narrate anecdotes of them and what had been their eventual destinies. Jane having been the daughter of a man who had been transported for poaching, was to Joe a sort of recommendation, and it ended in his taking her for his wife. They had not been long settled in theircottage before Joe's former propensities returned ; in fact, he could not be idle, he had carried a musket too long, and had lived such a life of ex citement in the service of his country, that he found it impossible to exist without shooting at something. All his former love of poaching came strong upon him, and his wife, so far from checking him, encouraged him in his feelings. The consequence was, that two years after his marriage Joe Rushbrook was the most determined poacher in the county. Al though often suspected, he had never been detected ; one great cause of this was his appearing to be such a drunkard, a plan hit upon by his wife, who had ob that drunken men were not suspected of being poachers. This scheme had there fore been hit upoi successfully; for pr Lte that a man was carried home dead drunk and speech- at midnight, was quite as good an tuld be brought forward. Joe Rushbrook had, therefore, the credit of be ing a worthless, drunken fellow, who lived upon his pension and what his wife could earn ; but no one had an idea that he was not only earning his livelihood, but laying by money from his successful night-labours. Not that Joe did not like a drop oo ally ; on the contrary, he would sonn drink freely\u2014 but, generally speaking, the ds in his head were complained of. and he would, if the wind was fresh and set in the right quarter, contrive to be carried home on the night in which he had most work to do. Such was the case, as we have represented in the first chapter. Little Joey, who, as the reader may anticipate, will be our suture hero, was born the first year after marriage, an hild. He was a quiet, thought ful, reflective boy foi his years\u2014 ai imbibed his father's love of walking out on a dark night to an extraordinary degree ; it was strange to see how much pru mingled with the '\u25a0 her had trained him early, first to a little shrimp like Joey could do, without being ected to be otherwise employed than in picking blackberries. Before he was seven years old, Joey could set a springe as well .is his father, and was well versed in all the mystery and art of unlawful taking of game. Indeed, he was very valuable to his father, and could do what his father could not have ventured upon without exciting suspicion. It was, perhaps, from his constant vigils, that tne little boy was so small in size ; at all events, his diminutive is the cause of there being no suspicion attached to him. Joey w i ilarly to the day-scbool*of Mr. Fun: although often up the best part of the nighf, lie was one of the best and most diligent of the scholars. No one could have supposed that the litde fair-haired, quiet-looking boy, who was so busy his books or his writing, could have been out half the night on a perilous excursion, for such it was at tru ire speaking of. It need hardly be observed that Joey med one important lesson, which was to be silent \u2014 not even Mum, the dog, who could not speak, was more secret or more faithful It is astonishing how much the nature aud disposition of a child may be altered by early tuition. Let a child' be always with its nurse, even under the guidance of a moth brought up as chil usually are, and it will continue to be a child, and even childish after childho gone. But take the same child, put it by degrees in situations of peril, requiring thought and observation beyond its years, accustom it to nightly vigils, and to watch- ed to hold its tongue, and it is aston ishing how the mind of that child, ho w much its body may suffer, will de itself so as to meet the demand upon it. Thus it is with lads who are sent early to sea, and thus it was with little loey. He was a man in some points, although a child in others. He would pia companions, laugh as loudly as the oth but still he would never breathe a hint of what was his father's employment. He to church every Sunday, as did his father and mother \u2014 for they consii that poaching was no crime, althi punished as such by the laws, and he, of course, considered it no crime, as he only r and mother wished. Let it not be thought, th al the morals of our littli ed by his father's profession, for such was not the case. Having entered into this necessary ex planation, we will now proceed. of North American Indians could have observed a better trail, than that kept by our little party. Rushbrook \\"], [21, "THE POACHER. 5 followed by our hero and the dog Mum. Not a word was spoken ; they continued their route over grass-lands and ploughed fields, keeping in the shade of the hedge- is Rushbrook stopped for a while to reconnoitre, so did Joey, and so did Mum, at their relative distances, until the march was resumed. For three miles and a half did they thus continue, until they ar rived at a thick cover. The wind whistled through the branches of the bare I oak and ash ; the cold damp fog now stationary, and shrouded them as they proceeded cautiously by the beaten track in the cover, until they had passed . i it. ai 'd an ed on the other side, the cottage of a gamekeeper was situated. A feeble light was burning, and shone through the diamond-paned win- Rushbrook walked out clear of the cover, and held up his hand to ascertain precisely the direction of the wind. Having d liimself, he retreated into the cover in a direction so as to be exactly to lee ward of the keeper's house, that the noise of the report of his gun might not be heard. Having cleared the hedge, he \u25a0) as to bring the barrel within two or three inches of the ground, and walked slowly and cautiously through i ish wood, foUowed as before by Joey him. After about a quarter of a valk, a raiding of metal was heard, and they stopped short : it was the barrel of the fowling-piece which had brushed ed to a spring-gun, set for the benefit of poachers. Rushbrook lifted up his left ha sign to Joey not to move, and following the wire, by lUally rattling his barrel against it, :ntually arrived at the gun itself, opene irew out all the priming, leaving it with the pan open, so that it ' not go off, in case they fell in with another of the wires. Rushbrook then proceeded to business; for he well knew that the gun would be set where the phea- sants were most accustomed to roost ; he put a small charge of powder in his fowling- that, being so near, he might not shatter the birds, and because the noise of the report would be mu \u25a0 jon discovei I black masses which the bodies of the r< nted between and raising his pii a heavy bound on the earth near the discharge, Joey then slipped forward and put the pheasant into his 1 t and another shol brought an increase to Joey's load. ls when gave a low growL This was the signal for people being near. Rushbrook snapped his finger ; the dog came forward to his side and stood motionless, with ears and tail erect, in a minute's time was heard the rustling of branches as the party ...rough the underwood. Rushbrook stood still, waiting the signal Mum, for the dog had been taught, if the parties advancing had another dog with them, always to raise his forefeet up lo Rushbrook's knees, but not other Mum make no such sign, and then Rush brook lay down in the brushwood, his motions being closely followed by his son aud his dog. Voices in whispers were now heard, and the forms of two men with guns were to be seen not four yards from where they were lying. \" Somewhere about here, I'll swear,\" said one, \"Yes, I think so; but it may be further on \u2014 the down the sound.\" \u2014 \" Very true, let's follow them, and they may fall back upon the spring-gun.'' The parties then ad iu to the cover, and were soon out of sight; after a time, Rushbrook held his ear to : that all was safe, moved homewards, and arrived without further adventure, having relieved joey of the heavy sack as soon as they were in the At three o'clock in the morning he tapped at the back door of the o Jane opened it, and the spoils of the night in a secret place, they were all soon in bed and fast asleep. CHAPTER III. TRAIN A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO, AND HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM IT. It is an old saying, that \" if there were no receivers there would be no thieves,\" and it would have been of very little use for Rushbrook to take the game if he had not had the means of disposing of it. In this Byres, the pedlar, was a valuable ;ary. Byres was a radical knave, v. ho did not admire hard work. At first he took up the profession of brick L labourer, one that is of a nature only ng occasional work and mi d wages. He did this that he might apply 5t for relief and do nothing fer the major portion of the year. But even a few months' work would not suit him. and rained his sustenance by carrying on his head a large basket of crockery, and disposing of his wares . tagers. At last he took out a pedlar's licence \u2014 perhaps one of the most danger-"], [22, "6 THE POACHER. ous permits ever allowed by a government, and which has been the cause of much of the ill-will and discontent fomented among the lower classes. I_atterly, the cheapness of printing and easiness of circulation have rendered the profession of less consequence nty years ago the village alehouses were not provided with newspapers ; it was an expense never thought of; th went to drink their beer and talk ov news of the vicinity, and if there disturbance in any other portion of the United Kingdom, the fact was only gained by rumour, and that vaeucly and longafrer it had taken place. But when the pedlar -.pearance, which he at last did, weekly or oftener, as it might happen, there was a great change ; he was the party who supplied information, and, in consequence, he was always welcome, and looked upon as au oracle ; the best seat near the fire was reserved for him, and having deposited his pack upon the table or in a comer, he would then produce the Propeller, or some other publication full of treason and blasphemy, and read italoud for the benefit of the labourers assembled. A few months were more than sufficient to produce the most serious effects : \u2014 men had worked cheerfully through the day, and r- ied with their lot and thankful that work was to be obtained, now remained at the public- , canvassing the conduct of govern ment, and leaving their resort satisfied in their own minds that they were ill used, harshly treated, and in bitter bondage. If they met their superiors, those very parties to whom they were indebted for employ ment, there was no respect shown to them as formerly \u2014 or if so, it was sullen and forced acknowledgment. The church was graduallv deserted \u2014 the appearance of the pastor was no long?r a signal for every hat to be lifted from the head ; on the contrary, boys of sixteen or seventeen years of age would lean against the church, or the of the churchvard, with their hands in both pockets, and a sort of leer upon their I as though they defied the pastor on his appearance \u2014 and , ney remain le during Ihe .:, un quailed and without blusl S, cast upon iheni out again. Such he state of things in the village of f rd in one year after the pedlar had added it to his continual rounds \u2014 and Byres great favourite, for he procured for mien what they commissioned him to obtain \u2014 supj i ibbons and gewgaws \u2014 and trusted to a considerable extent His re-appearance was al isly looked for ; he lived scot-free at the public-house, for he brought so much custom, and was the occasion of the drink ing of so much ale\u2014 that the landlord con sidered his coming as a god-send. His box of ware was well supplied in the summer months, for the fine weather was the time for the wearing of gay ribbons; but in the winter he travelled more to receive orders, or to carrv away the game supplied to him .hers, with whom he w league. Had his box been examined during the shooting season, it would have been found loaded with pheasants, not with trinkets and ribbons. It need hardly be observed after this, that Byres was the party who took off the hands of Rush! all the game which he procured, and which he had notice to call for before daylight, generally the second morning after it had been obtained ; for Rushbr > cautious to trust Byres with his of never going out of anight wil previously pretended intoxication, and hav ing suffered himself to be led or carried home. Our readers will acknowledge that Joey was placed in a very dangerous posi- tion ; it is true that he was not aware that he was doing wrong in assisting his father ; nevertheless, being a reflective boy, it did sometimes occur to him that it was odd that what was right should be done so secretly ; and he attempted to make out how it was that the bit- everywhere, and appeared to belong to every one, might not be shot in the day. He knew that the laws sorb a but he inquired of himself why su. i ! be. Joey had heard but the question, and was therefore pu It was fortunate for him that the pastor of the parish, although he did not reside in if, did at least once a week call m at A. I school, and examine the boy. Mr. Fur ness, who was always sober during the school hours, was very proud of visits, and used to point out I his most promising schol nduced o take more immediate notice of our hero, and the commendation which he received, and the advice that was be- 1 upon him .!y the great why Joey did attend assiduously to his lessons, which his otherwise vagrant life would have disinclined him to do ; and .er for honesty and good hich lie really deserved. In deed, his father and mother, setting aside poaching, and the secrecy resorted to in consequence, were bv no means bad ex amples in the oidinary course of life ; they did to their neigl il y would be done d honest in their"], [23, "THE POACHER. 7 dealings, and invariably inculcated probity and a regard to trut-h-on their son. This may appear anomalous to many of our readers, but there are many strange anoma lies in this world. It may tl stated, in a very few words, that although :ro had every chance of even tually following the road to ruin, yet, up to the present time, lie had not entered it. Such was the life led by little Joey for -ubsequent to our introduction of Kim to the reader ; every day he became more useful to his father ; latterly he had not attended school but in the forenoon, s we have before observed, Joey could, from his diminutive size and unsus picious appearance, do much that his father would not have ventured to attempt. He was as well versed in the art of snaring as his father, and sauntering like a child about the fields and hedge-rows, would examine his nooses, take out the game, and hide it till he could bring it home. Sometimes he would go out at night at tended only by Mum, and the dog would invariably give him mute notice, by simply standing with his ears and tail erect, when the keepers had discovered the snares, and were lying in wait for th to lav hold of he came to ascertain his a case, Joey very often would not retreat, but crawling on his stomach, would arrive at the snare, and take out the animal without the keeper. him for their eye invarial i to the horizon, watch ing the appearance of some stout figure of a man, while Joey crawled along bearing away the prize unseen. At times, Joey would reap a rich harvest in the broad day, by means of his favourite game-cock. Having put on the animal his steel spurs, he would plunge into the thickest of the cover, and selecting some small spot of cleared ground for the com bat, would throw down his gallant bird, and conceal himself in the brushwood ; ime-cock would immediately crow, re was immediately an swered by the pugnacious male pheasant, who Hew down to meet him : the combat was shot, for the pheasant was soon the sharp steel of his adver- one antagonist fell dead, again would the game-cock crow, and his chal- ie accepted by another. In an hour or two the small arena was a fi blood ; Joey would creep forward, put his \u25a0 ous cock into his bag togetln t his many dead adversaries, and wal opportunity for a safe retreat. Such was the employment of our hero; and although suspicion had often been attached to his father, none had an idea that (here had been a violation of the laws on the part of the son, when an event tuck place which changed our hero's destiny. CHAPTER IV. IN WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS EN- DEAVOURED, WITH ALL HIS POWER, TO SUIT THE PRESENT TASTE OF THE PUBLIC. We have said that Byres was the n of the game obtained by Rushbrook. It so happened, that in these accounts Byres had not adhered to his duty towards his neighbour ; in fact, he attempted to over- . thout success, and from that time Byres became Rashbrook's determined, butsecret, enemy. Somemonthshadpassed since their disagreement, and there was a mutual mistrust, (as both men were equally revengeful in their tempers,) when they ned to meet late on a Saturday night at the ale-house, which was their usual re sort. Furness the schoolmaster was there ; he and many others had already drunk too much ; all were boisterous and noisy. A few of the wives of those drinking were waiting patiently and sorrowfully outside, their arms folded in their aprons as fence against the cold, watching for their to come out, that they might coax them home before the major part of nings had been spent in liquor. Byres had the paper in his hand \u2014 he had taken it from the schoolmaster, who was too far gone to read it, and was dedninnng loudly against all governments, monarchy, and laws\u2014 when a sir anger entered the tap room where they were all assembled, 'lush brook was at the time sitting down, intend ing quietly to take a pint and walk home, as he had too much respect for the Sabbath I >w his profession of poacher on the morning of that day : he did not intend, therefore, to resort to his usual custom of pretending to be intoxicated : but when the stranger came in, to his great surprise he observed a glance of recognition be tween him and Byres, after which they appeared as if they were perfect stran Rushbrook watched them carefully, but so as not to let them perceive he was so doing, when a beckon from the stranger to Byres was again made. Byres continued to read the paper and to harangue, but at the time took an opportunity of making a sig nal in reply. There was something in the stranger's appearance which told Rush brook that he was employed as a keeper, or something in that way, for we often single"], [24, "8 THE POACHER out our enemies by instinct. That there was mischief in the wind Rushbrook felt sure, and his heart misgave him \u2014 the more so, as occasionally the eyes of both were turned towards him. After a little reflection, Rushbrook determined to feign intoxica tion, as he had so often done befc called foranotherpint, forsome time talked very loud, and at last laid his head on the table; after a uate he lifted it up a^ain, drank more, and then fell back on the bench. By degrees the company thinned, until there was no one left but the schoolmaster, the pedlar, and the stranger. The school master, as usual, offered to assist the ped lar in helping Rushbrook to his cottage ; but Byres replied that he was busy, and that he need not wait for Rushbrook ; the friend he had with him 1st him in taking home the drunken man. The schoolmaster reeled home, leaving the two together. They sat down on the bench, not far from Rushbrook, who appeared to them to be in the last stage of inebriety. Their conversation was easily overheard. The pedlar stated that he had watched several nights, but never could find Rushbrook left his cottage, but he had traced the boy more than once; t! had promised to have game ready for him on Tuesday, and would go out on Monday for it. In short, Rushbroc . covered that Byres was about lo betrpy him to the man, whom, in the course of their conversation, he found out to be a game-keeper newly hired by the lord of the manor. After a while they broke up, Byres having promised to join the keeper in his expedition and to assist in securir . former ally. Having made these arrange ments, they then took hold of Rushbrook by the arms, and shaking him ' as much as they cc ul m home cottage, an e. As soon as the door was closed, Rushbrook's long repressed anger could no longer be restrained : he started on his feet, and striking his fist on the table S( . iching. Upon his wife's demanding an explanation, Rushbrook, in d the whole. Jane, however she might agree with him in his indignation, like all w i shuddered at the thou dding persuaded h he had but one fe , ven- I I he may i pelled by the passion, he stops at the idea of shedding blood. But when a man who had hke Rushbrook, ser long in the army, witnessed such see: carnage, and so often passed his bayonet through his adversary's body, is roused up by this fatal passion, the death of a fellow creature becomes a matter of indifference provided he can gratify his feelings. Thus it was with Rushbrook, who, before he on the morning of that Sabbath, in which, had he gone to church, he could have so sted his trespasses might i given, as he \"forgave them who trespassed against him,\" \u2014 had made up his mind that ig short of the pedlar's death satisfy him. At breakfast, he appeared to hsten to his wife's entreaties, and pre to do the oo harm; and told her, that instead of going out on the M as he had promised, he should go out on that very night, and by that means the snare laid for him. Jane persuaded him not to go out at all, but this, Rush brook would not consent to. He told her that he was determined to show them that 5 not to be drive off his beat, and make Gyres believe on Tuesday .light that he had been out on the Monday night. Rushbrook's object was to have a meeting with Byres, if | ne, to tax him with his treachery, and then to take summary vengeance. Aware that Byres slept at the ale-ho there a little before dark, and told him he intended going out on that night ; that uld be better if, instead of coming on Tuesday, he were to meet him at a of one of the covers, which he described, at on, when he v over tc . ; ich he might who saw in this an lent and easy method of trapping Rusi consented to it, ii should meet Rushbrook.

At last ook said\u2014 \"Joey, my boy, I've killed many a man in my time, and I have thought nothing of it ; I slept as sound as ever the next night But then, you see, I was a soldier, and it was my trade, and I could look on the man I had killed without feeling sorrow or . , but I can't look upon this man, He was my enemy ; but \u2014 I've mur- it now.

CHAPTER V. THE SINS OF THE FATHER ARE VISITED UPON THE CHILD. Jane had remai >te of great anxiety during her husband's ab watching and listening to every sound; every five minutes raising the latch i door, and looking out, hoping to see him"], [26, "THE POACHER. 10 return. As the time went on, her alarm increased ; she laid her head down on the table and wept ; she could find no conso lation, no alleviation of her anxiety ; she dropped down on her knees and prayed. She was still appealing to the Most High, when a blow on the door announced her husband's return. There was a sullen gloom over his countenance as he entered : he threw his gun carelessly on one side, so that it fell, and rattled against the paved floor ; and this one act was to her ominous of evil. He sat down without speaking ; falling back in the chair, and lifting his eyes up to the rafters above, he appeared to be in deep thought, and unconscious of her presence. \"What has happened?\" inquired his wife, trembling, as she laid her hand on his shoulder. \"Don't speak to me now,\" was the reply- \"Joey,\" said the frightened woman in a whisper, \" what has he done?\" Joey answered not, but raised his hand, red wilh the blood which was now dried upon it. Jane uttered a faint cry, dropped on her and covered her face, while Joey walked into the back kitchen, and busied himself in removing the traces of the dark deed. A quarter of an hour had elapsed \u2014 Joey had returned, and taken his seat upon his low stool, and not a word had been ex changed. There certainly is a foretaste of the future punishment which awaits crime ; for how dreadful were the feelings of those who were now sitting down in the cottage. Rushbrook was evidently stupefied from excess of feeling ; first, the strong excite ment which had urged him to the deed ; and now from the re-action, the prostration us mental power which had succeeded it. jane dreaded the present and the future \u2014 whichever way she turned her eyes the gibbet was before her\u2014 the clanking of chains in her ears ; in her vision of the future, scorn, misery, and remorse \u2014 she >.ly for her hi >r boy, he felt for both. Even the dog showed, as he looked up into Joey's face, that h awai\\ 1 had been done. The silence, wliich it appeared none would e to break, was at last dissolved by i the village church solemnly striking two. They all started I them of the bell d of time and of eter- but time present quickly effaced for t would be daylight, and the blood of the murdered man would appeal to his fellow-men for vengeance. The sun would light them to the deed of darkness \u2014 the body would be brought home \u2014 the magistrates would as semble\u2014and who would be the party suspected ? \"Merciful Heaven!\" exclaimed Jane, \" what can be done?\" \"There is no proof,\" muttered Rush brook. \"Yes, there is,\" observed Joey, \"I left my bag there, when I stooped down to \u2014 \" \"Silence!\" cried Rushbrook. \"Yes,\" continued he bitterly to his wife, \"this is your doing, you must send the boy after me, and now there will be evidence against me ; I shall owe my death to you.\" \"Oh, say not so ! say not so I \" replied Jane, falling down on her knees, and weeping bitterly as she buried her face in his lap ; ' ' but there is yet time,\" cried she, starting up, \"Joey can go and fetch the bag. You will, Joey : won't you, dear? you are not afraid \u2014 you are innocent.\" \"Better leave it where it is, muther,\" replied Joey, calmly. Rushbrook looked up at his son with surprise, Jane caught him by the arm ; she felt convinced the boy had some reason for what he said \u2014 probably some plan that would ward off\" suspicion \u2014 yet how could that be, it was evidence against them, and after looking earnestly at the boy '; she dropped his arm. \" Why so, Joey ?\" said she, with apparent calmness. \" Because,\" replied Jot been thinking about it all this time; I am ut, and therefore I do not mind if they suppose me guilty. The bag is known to be mine \u2014 the gun I must throw in a ditch two fields off. You must gi money, if you have any ; if not, I must go without it ; but there is no time to be lost ; I must be off and away from here in ten minutes; to-morrow ask everyone if they have seen or heard of me, because I have left the house some time during the night.

I did it to deceive him ; and, as sure as I sit here, they will have that boy up as evidence against his father. \" \"To be sure they will,\" cried Joey; \"and what could I do? I dare not \u2014 f don't think I could \u2014 tell a lie ; and yet I would not 'peach upon father, neither.

Jane, give him all the money you have ; lose not a moment ; quick, wo man, quick.\" And Rushbrook appeared to be in an agony. Jane hastened to the cupboard, opened a small box, and poured the contents into the hands of Joey. \"Farewell, my boy,\" said Rushbrook; \" your father thanks you.\" \" Heaven preserve you, my child,\" cried Jane, embracing him, as the tears rained her check?. V \u2014 no ! you must not \u2014 mercy !- I shall never see bim again ! \" \u2014 and the mother fainted on the floor. The tears rose in our hero's eyes as he \u25a0 ondition o: i nother. Once more he grasped his father's hand ; and then, catching up the gun, he went ont at the back door, and driving back the dog, who would have followed him, mad^ over the fields as fast a:: his legs could carry him. CHAPTER VI. \"THE WORLD BEFORE HIM, WHERE TO CHOOSE.\" a ve no doubt but many of our readers have occasionally, when on a journey, come re the road divides into two, forking out in different directions, and, the road new to them ha re not known which of the two branches they ought to take. This happens, as it often does in a - to be I now. Shall we follow little Joey, or his father and mother \u2014 that is the quesl that when a road does thus divide, the widest of the two branches is generally selected, a 5 'he continuation of the road. We shall ourselves act upon that principle ; and, as the hero of the tale is of more consequence than characters accessory, we shall follow up the fortunes of little Joey. As soon as our hero had deposited the gun so that it might be discovered by any one passing by, he darted into the high road, and went off with all the speed that he was capable of, and it was not yet light when he found himself at least ten miles from his native village. As the day dawned, he quitted the high road, and took to the fields, keep ing a parallel course, so as to still increase his distance ; it was not until he had made fifteen miles, that, finding himself ex hausted, he sat down to recover himself. From the time that he had ieft the cottage until the present, Joey had had but one overwhelming idea in his head, was, to escape from pursuit, and by his absence to save his father from sus picion ; hut now that he had effected that purpose, and was in a state of quiei. ihoughts rushed upon his mind. First, the scenes of the last few hours presented themselves in rapid array befoie him \u2014 lie thought of the dead man, and he looked at his hand to ascertain if the bloody marks had been effaced; and then he thought of his poor mother's state^when he quitted the cottage, and the remem brance made him weep bitterly; his own position came next upon him, \u2014 a boy, twelve years of age, adrift upon the world \u2014 how was he to live \u2014 what was he to do? This reminded him that his mother had him money ; he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled it out to ascertain what he possessed. He had \u00a3 i i6j. ; to him a large sum, and it was all in he became more composed, he began to reflect upon what he had better do ; where should he go to? \u2014 London. It was way, he knew, but the farther he was from home, the better. Besides, he had heard much of London, and that every one got employment there. Joey res that he would go to London ; he knew that he had taken the right road so far, and having made up his mind, tie rose up, and proceeded. He knew that, if pos he must not allow himself to be seen on the road for a day or two, and h puzzled how he was to get food, which he already felt would be very acceptab1' then, what account was he to give of him self, if questioned? Such were the cogita tions of our little hero as he vended his way till he came to a river, which was too deep and rapid for him to attempt to ford \u2014 he was obliged to retm J. road to cross the bridge. He looked around him before he climbed over the low stone"], [28, "THE POACHER. 12 wall, and perceiving nobody, he jumped on the footpath, and proceeded to the bridge, where he suddenly faced an old woman with a basket of brown cakes, something like gingerbread. Taken by surprise, and hardly knowing what to say, he inquired if a cart had passed that way? \" Yes, child, but it must be a good mile a-head of you,' ' said the old woman, \"and you must walk fast to overtake it.\" 1 I have had no breakfast yet, and I am hungry ; do you sell your cakes?\" \"Yes, child, what else do I make them for? three a penny, and cheap too.\" Joey felt in his pocket until he had selected a sixpence, and pulling it out, desired the old woman to give him cakes for it, and, taking the pile in his hand, he set off as fast as he could. As soon as he was out of sight, he again made his way into the fields, and breakfasted upon half nis store. He then continued his journey until nearly one o'clock, when, tired out is, as soon as he had finished the remainder of his cal lay down under a rick of corn and feU fast asleep, having made twenty miles since he started. In his hurry to i pursuit, and the many th< \" occupied his brain, Joey had made no observation on the weather; if he had, he have looked after some mor^ er than the lee-side of a haystack. He slept soi he had not been asleep more than an hour, when the wind changed, and the snow fell fas' ; nevertheless, Joey slept on, and probably never would have awakened more, had it not been that a shepherd and his do returning home in the id hap pened to pass close to the h this time | i n covered with a layer of snow, half an inch d it not been for the dog I up to when menced pawing the off him, he would have been ; . ered by the shepherd, v>ho, ome trouble, succe< ingour hero from his tors i lifting him. contrived to lead him smith's shop, in a small village, before Joey been said to have re covered his scattered senses.

Well, catch them, no doubt.\" The blacksmith's wife, who had been a party to what was going on, now brought little warm ale, which quite r lished Joey ; and at the same time a waggon drove up to the door, and stopped at the blacksmith's shop. \" I must have a shoe tacked on the old mare, my friend,\" said the driver. \" You won't be lo \"Not five minutes,\" replied the smith. ing to London? \" \" Y \"Here's a poor boy that has been left behind by his father and mother son \u2014 you wouldn't mind giving him a lift?\" \"Well, I don't know ; I suppose I must be paid for it in the world to come.\" \"And good pay too, if you earn it,\" observed the blacksmith. \"Well, it won't make much difference to my eight horses, I expe I - looking at Joey ; \"so youngsrer ; you may perch yourself of the straw, above the goods.\" \"First come in with me, child,\" said the wife of the blacksmith; \"you have some good victuals to take with vou \u2014 so, while you shoe the horse, John, I'll see to the I The woman put before Joey a dish in which were the remains of more thai our hero comment attack without del: \" Have you any money, child?\" inquired the woman.

And such was the ca: three days and three nights, without any further adventure, he found himself, al though he was not aware of it, in Oxford street, somewhat about eight or nine o'clock in the evening. \"Do you know your way now, boy?\" said the can: \" I can ask it,\" rephed Joey, \"as soon as I can go to the light and read the address. Good-bye, and thank you,\" con tinued he, glad at last to be clear of any more evasive replies. The carman shook him by the hand as they passed the Boar and Castle, and him farewell, and our hero found himself alone in the vast metropolis. What was he to do? He hardly knew \u2014 but one thought struck him, which was, that he must find a bed for the night. He wandered up and down Oxford-street for some time, but every one walked so quick that he was afraid to speak to them \u2014 at last a little girl, of seven or eight of age, passed by him, and looked him earnestly in the face. an you tell me where I can get a bed for the night? \" said Joey. \" Have you any bradb? \" was the icply. \" What are those?\" said Joey. \"Any money, to be sure; why, you're green \u2014 quite.\" \" Yes, I have a shilling.\" \"That will do\u2014 come along, and you ;ii me.\" Joey followed her very innocently, and verv glad that he had been so fortunate. She led him to a street out of Tottenham court-road, in which there were no lamps \u2014 the houses, however, were large, and many stories high. \"Take my hand,\" said the girl, \"and mind how J ou tl ead.\" Guided by his new companion, Joey arrived at a door r' teopen; they entered, and, assisted by the girl, he went up a dark staircase to the second story. \u25a0ned a room-door, when Joey found himself in company with about twenty other children, of about the same age, of both sexes. Here were several beds on the floor of the room, which was spacious. In the centre were huddled together on the floor, round a tallow candle, eight or ten of the inmates, two of them playing with a filthy pack of cards, while the others looked over \u25a0 Dt hers were \\uig down or asleep on the several beds. \"This is m said the girl; \"if you are tired you can turn in at once. I shan't go to bed yet.\" Joey was tired and he went to bed; it was not very clean, but he had been used to worse lodgings lately. It need hardly be observed that Joey had got into very bad company, the whole of the inmates of the room consisting of juvenile thieves and pickpockets, who in the course of time obtain promotion in their profession, until re ultimately sent off to Botany Bay. Attempts have been made to check these nurseries of vice ; but pseudo-philanthro- have resisted such barbarous innova- tion ; and, upon the Mosaic principle, that you must not seethe the kid in the mother's milk, they are protected and allowed to arrive at full maturity, and beyond the e of being reclaimed, until they are ripe for the penalties oft; Joey slept soundly, and when he awoke next morning found tit _ friend was not with him . He dressed himself, and made another discovery, which was, that every farthing of his money had been abstracted from his pockets. Of this un- pleasant fact he ventured to complain to one or two boys, who were lying on other beds with their clothes on ; they laughed at him, called him a green-horn, and made use of other language, which at once let Joey know the nature of the company with whom he had been passing the night. After some altercation three or four of them bundled him out of the room, and Joey found himself in the street without a farthing, and very much inclined to eat a good breakfast. There is no portion of the world, small as it is in comparison with the whole, in which there is more to be found to cat and to drink, more comfortable lodgings, or accommodation and convenience of every kind than in the metropolis of England. provided you have the means to obtain it ; but, notwithstanding this abundance, there is no place, probablv, where you will find it mure difficult to obtain a portion of it, if you happen to have an empty pocket, Joey went into a shop here and there to ask for employment \u2014 he was turned away everywhere. He spent the first day in this manner, and at night, tired and hungry, he lay d-.wn on the stone steps of a portico, and fell asleep. The next morn ing he awoke shivering with the cold, faint"], [30, "14 THE POACHER. with hunger. He asked at the areas for something to eat, but no one would give him anything. At a pump he obtained a drink of water \u2014 that was all he could obtain, for it cost nothing. Another day passed without food, and the poor boy again sheltered himself for the night at a rich man's door in Berkeley-square. CHAPTER VII. IF YOU WANT EMPLOYMENT GO TO .DON. The exhausted lad awoke again, and pur sued his useless task of appeals for food and employment. It was a bright day, and there was some little warmth to be collected by basking in the rays of the sun, when our hero wended his way through St. James's Park, faint, hungry, and dis consolate. There were several people seated on the benches, and Joey, weak as he was, did not venture to go near them, but crawled along. At last, after wandering up and down, looking for pity in every body's face as they passed, and receiving none, he felt that he could not stand much longer, and, emboldened by desperation, he approached a bench that was occupied by one person. At first he only rested on the arm of the bench, but, as the person sitting down appeared not to observe him, he timidly took a seat at the further end. The personage who occupied the other part of the bench, was a man dressed in a morning suit a-la-militaire and black stock. He had clean gloves and a small cane in his hand, with which he was de scribing circles on the gravel before him, evidently in deep thought. In height he was full six feet, and his proportions combined strength with symmetry. His features were remarkably h. ndsome, his dark hair had a natural curl, and his whiskers and mustachios (for he wore those military appendages) were evidently the objects of much attention and solicitude. We may as well here observe, that although so favoured by nature, still there would have been considered something wanting in him by those who had been accustomed to move in the first circles, to make him the refined gentleman. His movements and carria int, but there was a certain retinue wanting. He bowed well, but still it was not exactly the bow of a gentleman. The nursery maids as i by said, \"Dear me, what a nme gentleman ; \" but had the remark been made by a higher class, it would have been qualified into \"what a handsome man.\" His age was apparently about five-and-thirty -it might have been some thing more. After a short time he left off his mechanical amusements, and turning round, perceived little Joey at the further end. Whether from the mere inclination to talk, or that he thotur bt it presuming in our hero to seat himself upon the same bench, he said to him \u2014 \"I hope you are comfortable, my little man ; but perhaps you've forgot your message.\" \" I have no message, Sir, for I know no one ; and I am not comfortable, for I am starving,\" replied Joey, in a tremulous voice. \"Are you in earnest now, when you say that, boy ; or is it that you're humbugging me?\" y shook his head. \"I have eaten nothing since the day before yesterday morning, and I feel faint and sick,\" replied he at last. His new companion looked earnestly in our hero's face, and was satisfied that what he said was true. \" As I hope to be saved,\" exclaimed he, \"it's my opinion that a little bread and butter would not be a bad thing for you. Here,\" continued he, putting his hand into his coat pocket, \"take these coppers, and go and get something into your little vitals.\" \"Thank you, Sir, thank you kindly. But I don't know where to go ; I only came up to London two days ago.\" \"Then follow me as fast as your little pins can carry you,\" said the other. They had not far to go, for a man was standing close to Spring-gardens-gate, with hot tea and bread and butter, and in a few moments Joey's hunger was considerably appeased. \" Do you feel better now, my little c \" Yes, Sir, thank you.\" \"That's right, and n. jo back to the bench, and then you shall tell me all about yourself, just to pass away the time. said he, as he took his seat, \"in the first place, who is your father, if you have any; and if you haven't any, what was he?\" \" Father and mother are both alive, but they are a long vay off\". Father was a soldier, and he has a pension now.\" 1 ' A soldier ! Do you know in what regiment?\" \"Yes, it was the 53rd, I think.\" \"By the powers, my own regiment! And what is your name, then, and hi \" Rushbrook,\" replied Joey. \" My pivot man, by all that's holy. Now haven't you nicely dropped on your feet?\" \"I don't know, Sir. \" replied our hero. ' ' But I do ; your father was the best"], [31, "THE POACHER. 15 fellow T. had in my company \u2014 the best forager, and always took care of his officer, as a good man should do. If there was a turkey, or a goose, or a duck, or a fowl, or a pig within ten miles of us, he have it : he was the boy for poaching. And tell me (and mind you tell the truth when you meet with a friend) what made you leave your father and mother? \" \" I vas afraid of_being taken up \u2014 \" and here Joey stopped, for he hardly knew what to say ; trust his new acquaintance with his father's secret he dared not ; neither did he like to tell what .vas directly false ; as the reader will perceive by his reply, he partly told the truth. \"Afraid of being taken up! why, what could they take u p a spalpeen like you for ? ' ' \" Poaching,\" replied Joey ; \"father poached too ; they had proof against me, so I came away \u2014 with father's consent.\" \"Poaching! well, I'm not surprisi that, for if ever it was in the blood, it is in yours \u2014 that's truth. And what do you mean to do now? \" \"Anything I can to earn my bread.\" \"What can you do \u2014 besides poaching, ? Can you read and write?\" yes.\" \"Would you like to be a servant \u2014 clean boots, brush clothes, stand behind a cab, run messages, carry notes, and hold your tongue ? ' could do all that, I think \u2014 I am twelve years old. \" \" The devil you are ; well then, for your father's sake, I'll see what I can do for you, till you can do better. I'll fit you out as a tiger, and what's more, unless I am devilish hard up, I won't sell you. So come along. What's your name ? \" \"Joey.\" ' ' Sure that was your father s name before you, I now recollect ; and should any one take the trouble to ask you what may be the name of your master, you may reply with a safe conscience, that it's Captain O'Donahue. Now, come along. Not close after me \u2014 you may as well keep open file I )w, till I've made you look a little more decent.\" CHAPTER VIII. A DISSERTATION UPON PEDIGREE, Our readers will not perhaps be displeased introduce Captain O'Donahue more particularly to their notice ; we shall there fore devote thi= chapter to giving some account of his birth, parentage, and sub sequent career, [f the father of Captain O'Donahue was to be believed, the race of the O'Donahues were kings in Ireland long before the O'Connors were ever heard of. How far this may be correct we cannot pretend to offer an opinion, further than that no man can be supposed to know so much of a family's history as the descend ant himself. The documents were never laid before us, and we have only the pi assertion of the Squireen O'Donahue asserted not only that they were kings in Ireland before the O'Connors, whose pretensions to ancestry he treated with contempt, but further, that they were renowned for their strength, and w ere famous for using the longest bows in battle that were ever known or heard of. Here we have circumstantial evidence, although not proof. If strong, they might have been kings in Ireland, for there \"might has been right\" for many centuries, and certainly their acquirements were handed down to posterity, as no one was more famous for drawing the long bow than the Squireen O'Donahue. Upon these points, however, we must leave our readers to form their own opinions. Perhaps some one more acquainted with the archives of the country may be able to set us right if we are wrong, or to corroborate our testimony if we are right. In his preface to \"Anne of Geierstein,\" Sir Walter Scott observes, that \" errors, however trivial, ought, in his opinion, never to be pointed out to the author, without meeting with a candid and respectful acknowledgment. \" Following the example of so great a man, we can only say, that if any gentleman can prove or disprove the assertion of the Squireen. O'Donahue, to wit, that the O'Donahues were kings of Ireland long before the O'Connors were heard of, we shall be most happy to acknowledge the favour, and insert his remarks ;n the next edition. We shall be further obliged to the same party, or indeed any other, if they would favour us with an idea of what was implied by a king of Ireland in those days ; that is to say, whether he held a court, taxed his subjects, collected revenue, kept up a standing army, sent ambassadors to foreign countries, and did all which kings do now a-days? or whether his shillelagh was his sceptre, and his domain some furze-ci hills and a bog, the intricacies of which were known only to himself? whether he was arrayed in jewelled robes, with a crown of gold weighing on his temples ? or whether he went bare-legged and bare armed, with his bare locks flowing in luxurious wildness to the breeze? We request an answer to this in full simplicity. We obser/e that even in Ireland, now, a fellow six feet high, and stout in proportion,"], [32, "16 THE POACHER. is called a \" prince of a fellow,\" although he has not wherewithal to buy a paper of tobacco to supply his dudeen . and, argu ing from this fact, we are inclined to think that a few more inches in stature, and commensurate muscular increase of power, I in former times have raised the \"heir apparent\" to the dignity of the Irish throne. But these abstruse specula tions have led us from our history, which we must now resume. Whatever may once have been the im portance of the house of O'Donahue, one thing is certain, that there are many ups and downs in this world; every family in it has its wheel of fortune, which revolves faster or slower as the fates decree, and the descendant of kings before the O'Con nors' time was now descended into a species of Viceroy, Squireen O'Donahue being the steward of certain wild estates in the county of Galway, belonging to .a family, who for many years had shown a decided aversion to the natural beauties of the country, and had thought proper to migrate to where, if people were not so much attached to them, they were at all events more civil ised. These estates were extensive, but not lucrative. They abounded in rocks, brush wood, and woodcocks during the season ; and although the Squireen O'Donahue did his best if not for his employer, at least for himself, it was with some difficulty that he contrived to support, with anything like respectability (which in that part of the country means \" dacent clothes to wear\"), a very numerous family, lineally descended from the most ancient of all the kings of Ireland. Before the Squireen had obtained his employment, he had sunk his rank and travelled much \u2014 as a courier \u2014 thereby gaining much knowledge of the world- Is, therefore, he had no wealth to leave his children, at all events he could impart to them that knowledge which is said to be better than worldly possessions. Having three sons and eight daughters, them grow.' . and strong, with commensurate appetites, he soon found necessary to get rid of them as fast as he could. His eldest, who, strange to say, for an O'Donahue, was a quiet lad, he had as a favour lent to bis brother, who kept a small tobacconist and grocer's shop in Dm is brother was so fond ot II O'Donahue to him as an apprentice. It radation for the descend- . out pennyworths of sugar, and supplying ipers of tobacco to the old ish-women ; but still there we must leave the heir apparent while w< to the second son, Mr. Patrick O'Donahue, e historv we are now relating, ; already made the reader acquainted with him by an introduction in St. James's Paik. CHAPTER IX. IN WHICH THE ADVICE OF A FATHER DCSERVES PECULIAR ATTE_. I IT may be supposed that, as steward of the estates, Squireen O'Donahue had seme influence over the numerous tenants on the property, and this influence he took care to make the most of. His assistance in a political contest was rewarded by the offer of an ensigney for one of his sons, in a regiment then raising in Ireland, and this offer was too good to be refused. So, one fine day, Squireen O'Donahue came home from Dublin, well bespattered with mud, and found his son Patrick also well bespattered with mud, having just returned home from a very successful expedition against the woodcocks. \" Patrick, my jewel,\" said the Squireen, taking a seat and wiping his face, for he was rather warm with his ride, \"you're a made man.\" \"And well made too, father, if the girls are anything of judges,\" replied Patrick, ii ou put me out.\" replied the Squireen ; \"you've more to be vain of than your figure. \" \"And what may that be, that you're discoursing about, father?\" \" Nothing more nor less, nor bet; worse, but you're an ensign in his Majesty's new regiment \u2014 the number has escaped my memory.\" \"I'd rather be a colonel, father,\" replied Patrick, musing. \"The colonel's to come, you spalp said the Squireen. \"And the fortune to make, I expect,\" replied Pati. \" You've just hit it ; but haven't you the whole world before you to pick an d choose ? '' \" Well,\" replied Patrick, after a pause ; \" I've no objection.'' \" No objection ! Why don't you out of your skin with delight? events you might jump high enough to .1 the caling.\" \"There's no ceiling to break,\" i Patrick, looking up at the rafters. hat's true enough : but still you might go c senses in a rational sort of a v \" I reaJUj for why, fat! , You tell me I'm to Is * old"], [33, "THE POACHER 17 mother, who doats upon me ; my sisters, who are fond of me ; my friends here (patting the dogs), who follow me ; the hills, that I love ; and the woodcocks, which I shoot ; to go to be shot at myself, and buried like a dead dog, without being skinned, on Ihe field of battle.\" 11 you to go forth into the world as an officer, and make your fortune ; to come back a general, and be the greatest man of your family. And don't be too unhappy not being skinned.

I'll make the best use of them when I start ; but i7's the staring I don't like, and that's the real truth.\" The reader may be surprised at the in difference shown by Patrick at the intelli gence communicated by his father ; but the fact was, Mr. Patrick O' Donahue was very deep in love. This cooled I ardour ; and it must be confessed that there .use, for a more lovely creature than Judith M'Crae never existed. To part with her was the only difficulty, and all his family feelings were but a cloak to the real cause of his unwillingness. \" Nevertheless, you must start to-mor row, my boy,\" said his father. \" What must be, must,' replied Patrick, \" so there's an end of the matter. I'll just go out for a bit of walk, just to stretch my legs.\" They require a deal of stretching, Pat, considering you've been twenty miles, at least, this morning, over the mountains,\" 1 the Squireen. But Patrick was out of hearing ; he had leapt over a stone wall which separated his father's potato-ground from Cornelius M 'Crae's, and had hastened to Judith, whom he found very busy getting eier read)-. \"Judith, my dear,\" said Patrick, \"my heart's qui7, broke with the bad news I have to tell you. Sure I'm going to leave you to-morrow morning \"Now, Patrick, you're joking, surely.\" \" Devil a joke in it. I'm an ensign in a nt.\" \" Then I'll die, Patrick.\" ,t 1 will, Judith; what with grief and a bullet to help it, perhaps.\" \" Now, what d'ye mean to do, Patrick?\" are; because I can't help lain, if ever luck of it.

I'll be back to dance at my own wedding, if so be I can.\" \"There'll be neither wedding for you, Patrick, nor wake either, for you'll lie on the cold ground, and be ploughed in like muck.\" \"That's but cold comfort from you, Judith, but we'll hope for a better ending ; but I must go back now, and you'll meet me this evening bevond the shealing.\" \"Won't it be for the last time, Patrick?\" replied Judith, with her apron up to her eyes. \"If I've any voice in the matter, I say no. Please the pigs, I'll come back a colonel. ' ' \"Then you'll be no match for Judith ._-,\" replied the sobbing girl. \" Shoot easy, my Judith, that's touching my honour ; if I'm a general it will be all the same.\" \"Oh, Patrick! Patrick!\" Patrick folded Judith in his arms, took one kiss, and then hastened out of the house, saying \u2014 \"Remember the shealing, Judith dear, there well talk the matter over easy and comfortable.\" Patrick returned to his house, where he found his mother and sisters in tears. They had received orders to prepare his ward robe, which, by-the-bye, did not give them much trouble Irom its extent ; they only had to mend every individual article. His father was sitting down by the hearth, and when he saw Patrick he said lo him \u2014 \" Now just come here, my boy, and take a stool, while you listen to me and learn a little worldly wisdom, fer T may not have much time to talk to you when we are at Dublin.\" Patrick took a seat and was ail attention. \" You'll just observe, Pat, that it's a very fine thing to be an officer in the king's army ; nobody dares to treat you ill, al though you may ill-treat others, which is no small advantage in this world.\" \" There's truth in that,\" replied Patrick. \" You see, when you get into an enemy's country, you may help yourself; and, if you look sharp, there's very pretty pickings \u2014 all in a quiet way, you understand.\" \" That, indeed.\" \" You observe, Pat, that, as one of his officers, the king expects you to appear and live like a gentleman, only he forgets to give you the means of so doing ; you must, therefore, take all you can get fiom his Majesty, and other people must make up the difference.\" \"That's a matter o' course, \"said Patrick. \"You'll soon see your way clear, and"], [34, "18 THE POACHER. find out what you may be permitted to do and what you may not ; for the king expects you to keep up the character of a gentleman as well as the appearance.\" \"O' course.\" \" Mayhap you may be obliged to run in debt a little \u2014 a gentleman may do that ; mayhap you may not be able to pay \u2014 that's a gentleman's case very often \u2014 if so, never go so far as twenty pounds ; first, because the law don't reach ; and secondly, because twenty pounds is quite enough to make a man suffer for the good of his co \"There's sense in that, father.\" \" And, Patrick, recollect that people judge by appearances in this wor'd, especi ally when they've nothing else to go by. If you talk small, your credit will be small ; but if you talk large, it will be just in proportion.\" \" I perceive, father.\" \" It's not much property we possess in this said county of Galway, that's certain ; but you must talk of this property as if I was the squire, and not the steward ; and when you talk of the quantity of wood cocks you have bagged, you must say on our property.\" \" I understand, father.\" \" And you must curse your stars at being a younger brother ; it will be an excuse for your having no money, but will make them believe it's in the family, at all events.\" \" I perceive,\" replied Patrick. \"There's one thing more, Pat ; it's an Irish regiment, so you must get out of it as soon as possible, by exchange.\" \" For why? \" \"This for why. You will be among those born too near home, and who may doubt all you say, because your story may interfere with their own. Get into an Eng lish regiment by all means, and there you'll be beyond the reach of contradiction, which a'n't pleasant.\" \"True enough, father.\" \" Treasure up all I have told you \u2014 it's worldly wisdom, and you have your fortune to make; so now recollect, never hold back at a forlorn hope; volunteer for everything; volunteer to be blown from a cannon's mouth, so that they will give you promotion for that same ; volunteer to go all over the world, into the other world, and right through that again into the one that comes after that, if there is any, and then one thing will be certain, cither that you'll be a colonel or general, or else \" ' ' Else what, father ? \" \"That you won't require to be made either, seeing that you'll be past all making ; but luck's all, and lucky it is, by-the-bye, that I've a little of the squire's rent in hand, to fit you out with, or how we should have managed the saints only know. As it is, I must sink it on the next year's account, but that's more easy to do than to fit you out with no money. 1 must beg the tenants off; make the potato crop fail entirely, and report twenty by name, at least, dead of starvation. Serve him right, for spending his money out of Old Ireland. It's only out of real pathriotism that I cheat him \u2014 just to spend the money in the country. And now, Patrick, I've done; now you may go and square your accounts with Judith, for I know now where the cat jumps; but I'll leave old Time alone for doing his work.\" Such was the advice of the Squireen to his son ; and, as worldly wisdom, it was not so bad ; and certainly, when a lad is cast adrift in the world, the two things you can bestow on him are a worldly wisdom and a little money, for, without the former, the latter and he will soon part company. The next day they set off for Dublin, Patrick's head being in a confused jumble of primitive good feeling, Judith M'Crae, his father's advice, and visions of future greatness. He was fitted out, introdn the officers, and then his father left him his blessing and his own way to make in the world. In a fortnight the regiment was complete, and they were shipped to Liver pool and from Liverpool to Maidstone, where, being all newly-raised men, they were lo remain for a time, to be disciplined. Before the year had expired, Patrick had followed his father's advice and exchanged, receiving a difference with an ensign of a regiment going on foreign service. He was sent to the West Indies, but the seasons were healthy, and he returned home an ensign. He volunteered abroad again, after five years, and gained his lieutenant's commission, from a death vacancy, without purchase. After a fifteen years' hard service, the desired captain's commission came at last, and O'Donahue, having been so unsuc cessful in his military career, retired upon half-pay, determined, if possible, to offer his handsome person in exchange for com petence. But during the fifteen years which had passed away, a great change had come over the ingenuous and unso phisticated Patrick O'Donahue ; he had mixed so long with a selfish and hea world, that his primitive feelings had gradually worn away. Judith had, indeed, never been forgotten, but she was now at rest, for, by mistake, Patrick had been returned\"dead of the yellow fever, and at the intelligence she had drooped like a"], [35, "THE POACHER. 19 drop and died. The only tie strong enough to induce him to return to Ireland was, therefore, broken, his father's worldly advice had not been forgotten, and O'Donahue considered the world as his oyster. Expensive in his habits and ideas, g for competence, while he vegetated on half-pay, he was now looking out for a matrimonial speculation. His generosity and his courage remained with him \u2014 two virtues not to be driven out of an Irish man, \u2014 but his other good qualities lay in abeyance ; and yet his better feelings were by no means extinguished ; they were dormant, but by favourable circum si Lgain to be brought into action. The world and his necessities made him what he was, for many were the times, for years afterwards, that he would in his reveries surmise how happy he might have been in his own wild country, where half-pay would have been competence, ha Judith been spared to him, and he could have laid his head upon her bosom. CHAPTER X. IN WHICH MAJOR M'SHANE NARRATES SOME CURIOUS MATRIMONIAL SPECU- LATIONS. OUR hero was soon fitted out with the livery of a groom, and installed as the confidential servant of Captain O'Donahue, who had lodgings on the third floor in a fashionable street. He soon became expert and useful, and as the Captain breakfasted at home, and always ordered sufficient for Joey to make another cold of during the day, he was at little or no expense to his master. One morning, when Captain O'Donahue was sitting in his dressing-gown at break- fa. t, Joe) opt. tied the door, and announced Major M'Shane. \"Is it yourself, O'Donahue?\" said the iding his hand; \"and, now, ye think has brought me here this fine morning? It's to do a thing that's rather unusual with me, neither more nor you the \u00a320 which you lent me a matter of three years ago, and which f, you never expected to see anything but the ghost of.\" \"Why, M'Shane, if the truth must be told, it will be something of a resurrection when it appears before me,\" replied O'Donahue; \"I considered it dead and buried ; and, like those who are dead and buried, it has been long forgotten.' \"Nevertheless, here it is, in four notes \u2014one, two, three, four; four times five is twenty ; there's arithmetic for you, and money to boot, and many thanks in the bargain, by way of interest. And now, O'Donahue, where have you been, have you been doing, what are you doing, and what do you intend to do? That's what I call a comprehensive inquiry, and a ver)' close one too.\" \"I have been in London a month, I have done nothing, I am doing nothing, and I don't know what I intend to do. You may take tbat fora comprehensive answer.\" \" I'll tell you all about myself without your asking. I have been in London for nearly two years, one of which I spent in courting and the other in matrimony.\" \" Why, you don't mean to say that you are married, M'Shane; if so, as you've been married a year, you can tell me, am I to give you joy ? \" \"Why, yes, I believe you may; there's nothing so stupid, O'Donahue, as domestic happiness, that's a fact; but, altogether, I have been so large a portion of my life doubtful where I was to get a dinner, that I think that on the whole I have made a very good choice. \" \" And may I inquire who is the party to whom Majoi has condescended to sacrifice his handsome person?\" \"Is it handsome you mane? As the ugly lady said to the looking-glass, I beg no reflections \u2014 you wish to know who she is ; well, then, you must be content to listen to all my adventures from the time we parted, for she is at the end of them, and I can't read backwards.\" \" I am at your service, so begin as you please.\" \" Let me see, O'Donahue, where was it that we parted?\" \" If I recollect, it was at the landing made at , where you were reported killed.\" \"Ven-' true, but that, I give my honour, was all a lie ; it was fat Sergeant Murphy that was killed, instead of me. He was a terrible fellow, that Sergeant Murphy ; he got himself killed on purpose, because he never could have passed his accounts : well, he fought like a devil, so peace be with him, I was knocked down, as you know, with a bullet in my thigh, and as I could not stand I sat upon the carcase of Sergeant Murphy, hound up my leg, and meditated on sublunary affairs. I thought what a great rogue he was, that Sergeant Murphy, and how he'd gone out of the world without absolution ; and then I tit it very likely that he might some money about him, and how much better it would be that I should have it to comfort me in prison than any rascally"], [36, "THE POACHER. 20 Frenchman ; so I put my hand in his pocket and borrowed his purse, which taking the difference of size, as well lined si himself. Well, as you had all retreated and left me to be taken prisoner, I waited very patiently till they should come and carry me to the hospital, or wherever else they pleased. They were not loug coming for me : one fellow would have passed his bayonet through me, but I had my pistol cocked, so he thought it advisable to take me prisoner. I was taken into the town, not to the hospital or the prison, but quartered at the hou?e of an old lady of high rank and plenty of money. Well, the surgeon came and very politely told me that he must cut off my leg, and I very politely told him to go to the devil ; and the old lady came in and took my part, when she saw what a handsome leg it was, and sent for another doctor at her own expense, who promised to set me on ray pins in less than a month. Well, the old lady fell in love with me ; and although she was not quite the vision of youthful fancy, as the saying is, for she had only one tooth in her head, and that stuck out half an inch beyond her upper lip, still she had other charms for a poor devil like me ; so I made up my mind to marry her, for she made cruel love to me as I laid in bed, and before I was fairly out of bed the thing was settled, and a week afterwards the day was fixed , but her relative wind of it, for, like an old fool, she could not help blabbing, and so one day there came a file of soldiers with a corporal at their head, informing me that I was now quite well, and therefore if it was all the same to me I must go to prison. This was anything but agreeable, and contrary to rule. As an of!' a titled to my parole; and so I wrote to the command ing officer, who sent for me, and then he told me I had my choice, to give up the old lady, whose friends were powerful, and her 1 elf (a personal remark, by-the-bye, which it w.i ime to make to a gentleman in my circum to be refused parole, and remain in prison, and that he would give me an hour to decide ; then he made me a very low bow and left me. I was I affair over in my mind, one n king of her purse and ca ind another I long tooth of hers, when one of her relatr :iad a proposal to make, v hat I should be released and sent to I dth a handsome sum of nses, if I would promise to give up the old lady no for ever. That suited my book ; I took the money, took my leave, and a small vessel took me to Gibraltar; so after all, you see, O'Donahue, the thing did not turn out so bad. I lost only an old woman with a long tooth, and I gained my liberty.\" \"No; you got out of that affair with credit.\" \"And with money, which is quite as good ; so when I returned and proved myself alive, I w^as reinstated, and had all my arrears paid up. What wil Murphy's purse, and the fort: and my arrears, I was quite flush ; so I resolved to be circumspect, and make hay while the sun shone ; notwithstanding which, I was as nearly trapped by a cun ning devil of a widow.

Well, I kept clear of such cunning articles, and only looked after youth and innocence in the city. At last I discovered the only daughter of a German sugar-baker in the Minories, a young thing about seventeen, but very little for her age. She went to a dancing school, and 1 contrived, by bribing the maid, to carry on the affair most success fully, and she agreed to run away with me, everything was ready, the post-chaise was at the corner of the street, she came with her bundle in her hand. 1 thrust it into the chaise, and was just tossing her in after it, when she cried out that she had forgot something, and must go ba. it; and away she went slipping through mv fingers.

Now comes another adventure, in which I turned the tables, anyhow ; I fell in with a very pretty girl, the daughter of r m Chancery-lane, who was said to kave.'and (I paid a shilling at Doctors' - Commoii. and read the will) it was true enough, an j t fortune from her grandmother. She was always laughing \u2014 full of mischief and practical jokes ded to be pleased, the hussey, with my addresses, and at last she consented, as I thought, to run away with me. I imagined that I had clinched the business at last, when one dark night I handed her into a ipped up in a cloak, and crying. However, 1 got her in, and away we went as if the devil was behind us. I coaxed her and soothed her, and promised ke her happy, but she still kept her cerchief up to her eye s, and wou permit me a chaste salute, even pushed iy when I would put my arm round all which I ascribed to the shame and modesty which a woman feels when she is doing wrong, At last, when about fifteen miles from town, there was a burst of laughter, and ' I think we have gone far enough. Major M'Shane.' By all the saints in the calendar, it was her scamp of a brother that had taken her place. 'My young gentleman,' said I, ' I think you have not only gone far enough, but, as I shall prove to you, perhaps a little too far,' for 1 was in no fool of a passion. So I set to, beat him to a mummy, broke his nose, blackened both his eyes, and knocked half his teeth down his throat, and when he was half dead I opened the chaise door as it whirled nlong, and kicked him out to take his chance of the wheels, or any other wheels, which the wheel of fortune might turn up for him. So he went home and told his sister what a capital joke it was, I've no doubt. I'll be bound the young gentleman has nc \\ away with an Irishman since that ; how- ever, I never heard any more about him or his lovely sister.\" \" Now then for the wind up, M'Shane.\" \" Courting 's very expensive, especially when you order post-chaises for nothing at all, and I was very nearly at the end of my rhino ; so I said to myself, \u2014 ' M'Shane, you must retrench.' And I did so ; instead of dining at the coffee-house, I determined to go to an eating-house, and walke* into one in Holborn, where I sat down to a plate of good beef and potatoes, and a large lump of plum-pudding, paid is. 6d., and never was better pleased in my life ; so I went there again, and became a regu- lar customer ; and the girls who waited laughed with me, and the lady who kept the house was very gracious. Now, the lady was good-looking, but she was rather too fat ; there was an amiable look about her even when she was carving beef, and by degrees we became intimate, and I found her a very worthy creature and as simple-minded as a child, although she could look sharp after her customers. It was, and it is now, a most thriving estab- lishment \u2014 nearly two hundred people dine there every day. 1 don't know how it was, but I suppose I first fell in love with her beef and then with her fair self, and finding myself well received at all times, I one day, as she was carving a beef-s teak-pie which might have tempted a king for its fragrance, put the question to her, as to how she would like to marry again. She blushed, and fixed her eyes down upon the hole she had made in the pie, and then I observed, that if there was a hole in my side as big as there was in the pie before her\u2014 she would see her image in my heart. This pretty simile did the business for me, and in a month we were married , and I never shall want a dinner as long as I live, either"], [38, "THE POACHER 22 for myself or friend. I will put you on the free list, O'Donahue, if you can condescend to a cook's shop ; and I can assure you, that I think I have done a very wise thing, for I don't want to present any wife at Court, and I have a very comfortable home.\" ' ' You have done a wise thing, in my opinion, M'Shane\u2014 you have a wife who makes money, instead of one who spends it.\" \" And moreover, I have found my bar gain better than I anticipated, which is sel dom the case in this world of treachery and deceit. She has plenty of money, and is putting by more every year.\" \" Which you have the control of at your disposition, do you mean to say? \" \"Why, yes, I may say that now \u2014 but, O'Donahue, that is owing to my circum spection and delicacy. At first starting I determined that she should not think that it was only her money that I wanted ; so, after we were married, I continued to find myself, which, paying nothing for board and lodging, and washing, I could easily do upon my half-pay ; aud I have done so ever since, until just now. \" I had not been married a week before I saw that she expected I would make in quiries into the state of her finances, but I would not ; at last, finding that I would not enter into the business, she did, and told me that she had Consols laid by, and that the business was worth per annum {you may fish at Cheltenham a long while, O'Donahue, before you get such a haul as that). So I told her I was very glad she was well off, and then I pretended to go fast asleep, as I never interfered with her, and never asked for money ; at last she didn't like it, and offered it to me, but I told her i had enough and did not want it ; since which she has been quite annoyed at my not spending money ; and when I told her this morning that there was a brother officer of mine arrived in town to whom I had owed some money for a long while, she insisted upon my taking money to pay it, put a pile of bank notes in my hand, and was quite mortified when she found I only wanted \u00a32,0. Now you see, O'Donahue, I have done this from principle; she earns the money, aud there fore she shall have the control of it as long as we are good friends : and upon my honour I really think I love her better than I ever thought I could love any woman in the world, for she has the temper, the kind ness, and the charity of an angel, although not precisely the figure ; but one can't have everything in this world : and so now you have the whole of my storv \u2014 and what do you think of it?\" \"You must present me to your wife, M'Shane.\" \"That I will with pleasure: she's like her rounds of beef \u2014 it's cut and come again \u2014 but her heart is a beauty, and so is her beef-steak-pie \u2014 when you taste it\" CHAPTER XI. IN WHICH AN INTERCHANGE AND CONFIDENCE TAKES PLACE. \"And now, O'Donahue,\" said M'Shane, \" if you are not yet tired of my company, I should like to hear what you have been doing since we parted : be quite as explicit, but not quite so long-winded as myself, for I fear that I tired you.\" \" 1 will be quite as explicit, my good fellow, but I have no such marvellous adventures to relate, and not such a for tunate wind up. I have been to Bath, to Chehenham, to Harrowgate, to Brighton, and everywhere else where people meet, and people are met with, who would not meet or be met with elsewhere. I have seen many nice girls, but the nice girls were like myself, almost penniless : and I have seen many ill-favoured, who had money ; the first I could only afford to look at, the latter I have had some dealings with. I have been refused by one or two, and I might have married seven or eight, but somehow or other when it came near the point, the vision of a certain angel now in Heaven has risen before me, and I have not had the heart or the heartlessness to proceed. Indeed, I may safely say, that I have seen but one person since we parted, who ever made the least impression on me, or whom I could fancy in any degree to replace her whom I have lost, and she, I fear, is lost also ; so we may as well say no more about it. I have determined to marry for money, as you well know, but it appears to me as if there was something which invariably prevents the step being taken ; and, upon my honour, fortune seems so inclined to balk me in my wishes, that I begin to snap my fingers at her, and am becoming quite indifferent. I suffer now under the evil of poverty, but it is impossible to say what other evils may be in store, if I were to change my condition, as the ladies say. Come what will, in one thing I am determined, that if I marry a girl for money, I will treat her well, and not let her find it out ; and as that may add to the difficulty of a man's position when he is not in love with his wife, why, all I"], [39, "THE POACHER. 23 can say is, Captain O'Donahue don't go cheap \u2014 that's decided. \" \" You're right, my jewel, there's not such a broth of a boy to be picked up every day in the week.

The Emperor was still at his country palace, and O'Donahue had been than a fortnight at the capital with- out there being an opportunity for the Ambassador to present him at court. Dimitri, the person whom O'Donahue ed as courier, was a very clever, intelligent fellow ; and as he found that O'Donahue had all the liberality of an nd was in every respect a most indulgent master, he soon had his interest at heart. Perhaps the more peculiar in- timacy between O'Donahue and M'Shane, as a valet, assisted Dimitri in forming a good opinion of the former, as the hauteur and distance generally preserved by the English towards their domestics are very sing to the continental servants, who, if permitted to be familiar, will not only serve you more faithfully, but be satis- fied with more moderate wages. Dimitri spoke English and French pretty well, Gi.iman and Russian of course perfectly. He was a Russian by birth, had been lling Plospital, at refore was not a serf. He soon became intimate with M'Shane; and as soon as the latter discovered that there was no intention on the part of . to be dishonest, he was satisfied, and treated him with cordiality. , our master this,\" said Dimitri, ' ' never to give his opinion on political matters before any one while in Peters burgh, or he will be reported to the govern ment, and will be looked upon with sus picion.

I shall be ordered to make my report in a few days, and I shall not fail to do so.\" \"And what will they ask you?\" said M'Shane. \" They will ask me first who and what your master is? Whether I have discovered from you, if he is of family and importance in his own country? Whether he has ex pressed any political opinions? and whether I have discovered the real business which brought him here?\" \"And what will you reply to all this?\" answered M'Shane. \"Why, I hardly know. ! wish I knew what he wished me to say, for he is a gentleman whom I am very fond of, and that's the truth ; perhaps you can tell me ?\" \" Why, yes, I know a good deal about him, that's certain. As for his family, there's not a better in Ireland or England, for he's royal if he had his right.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Dimitri. \" As sure as I'm sitting in this old arm chair, didn't he bring letters from the brother of the present King? does that go for nothing in this country of yours, or do you value men by the length of their beards ? \" ' ' Men are valued here not by their titles, but by their rank as officers. A general is a greater man than a prince,\" replied Dimitri. \" With all my heart, for then I'm some body,\" replied M 'Shane. \" You ? \" replied the courier. \"I mean my master, \"returned M'Shane, correcting himself, \"for he's an officer, and a good one too.\" \"Yes, that may be ; but you said your self,\" replied the courier, laughing. \" My good friend, a valet to any one in Peters burgh is no better than one of the mujiks who work in the streets. Well, I know that our master is an officer, and of high rank ; as for his political opinions, I have never heard him express any, except his admiration of the city, and of course of the Emperor.\" \"Most decidedly ; and of the Empress also,\" replied M'Shane. ' ' That is not at all necessary,\" continued"], [44, "2\u00a7 THE POACHER.

The next day O'Donahue, in his uniform, drove to the Ambassador's hotel, to accom pany him to the Annishkoff palace, where he was to be presented to the Emperor. O'Donahue was most graciously reo \u2014 the Emperor walking up to him, as he stood in the circle, and inquiring after the health of his Royal Highness the Com mander-in-Chief, what service he ha''. employed upon, &c. He then told O'Dona hue that the Empress would be most glad to make his acquaintance, and hoped that he would make a long stay at St. Petersburgh. It was with a quickened pulse that O'Donahue followed the Ambassador into the Empress's apartments. He had not waited there more than five minutes in conversation with the Ambassador, when the doors opened, and the Empress, at tended by her chamberlain, and followed by her ladies in waiting and maids of honour, entered the room. O'Doi had made up his mind not to take his eyes off the Empress until the presentation was over. As soon as he had kissed hands, and answered the few questions which were graciously put to him, he retired to make room for others, and then, for the first time, did he venture to cast his eyes on the group of ladies attending the Empress. The first that met his view were unknown, but, liehind all the rest, heat length per ceived the Princess Czar tori nski, talking and laughing with another lady. After a short time she turned round, and their eyes met.

Now, if she had been a General, it would have .ill up with you. Military rank is everything here, as Dimitri says.\" \"She's an angel,\" replied O'Donahue, with a sigh. \"That's rank in heaven, but goes for nothing in Petersburgh,\" replied M'Shane. \"Dimitri tells me they've civil generals here, which I conceive are improvements on our staff, for devil a civil general I've had the pleasure of serving under.\" \"What shall I do?\" said O'Donahue, getting up, and preparing to write his note 1 mbassador. at your dinner, drink a bottle of Champagne, and then I'll come and talk it over with you ; that's all you can do at present. Give me the note and I'll send Dimitii off with it at once, and order up your dinner.\" M'Shane's advice not being very bad, it wf.s followed. O'Donahue had finished his dinner, and was sitting by the fire with M'Shane, when there was a knock at the door. M'Shane was summoned, and soon returned, saying, \"There's a little fellow that wants to speak with you, and won't give his message. He's a queer little body, and not so bad-looking either, with a bol ster on the top of his head, and himself not higher than a pillow ; a pigeon could sit upon liis shoulder and peck up peas out of his shoes ; he struts like a grenadier, and, by the powers ! a grenadier's cap would i extinguisher for him. _: show him in ? \" \" Certainly,\" replied O'Donahue.

O'Donahue did not lose this opportunity of pouring out the real feelings of his heart, sou have come a long way to see me, Captain O'Donahue, and I ought to be grateful,\" replied the Princess; \"indeed, I have much pleasure in renewing our acquaintance.\" -onahue, however, did not appear satisfied with this mere admission : he became eloquent in his own cause, pointed out the cruelty of having brought him over again if he was not to be re warded, and, after --.bout an hour's plead ing, he was sitting on the sofa by her side, with her fair hand in his, and his arm round her slender waist. They parted, but thiough the instrumentality of the little dwarf they often met again at the same Occasionally they met in society, but before others they u ore obliged to appear constrained and formal : there ittle pleasure in such meetings, and when O'Donahue could not see the Prin cess, his i \u25a0 L.sure was to call upon Madame Erhausen and talk about her. \"You arc aware, Captain O'Dor, said the Countess, one day, \"that there will be a great difficulty to overcome in this affair.

If it is sup posed you do not come on my account, it will be inquired why you do come: and there is no keeping a secret at Petersburgh. After it is supposed that it is a settled affair between us, we then may consider what next ought to be done.

I shall play my own but, depend upon it, it will all end in a laugh.\" O'Donahue and his wife both wrote their letters, and O'Donahue also wrote one to die English Ambassador, informing him of what had taken place, and request- ing his kind offices. As soon as tin , finished, the Couniess bade them farewell, saying, \" I shall not send these letters until you are well out of reach, depend upon it ; \" and with many thanks for her kind- ness, O'Donahue and his brid adieu, and set off on their long journey. The carriage procured for their journey was what is called a which ir to an English chariot with a sleigh. and his young bride, M'Shane preferring to ride outside on the box with Joey, that he might not be in the way. as a third person invariably is with a newly-married couple. The snow was feet deep on the ground; bul air uas dry. and the sun shone bright. The bride was handed in, enveloped in a rich mantle of sable; O'Donahue foil equally protected against the cold ; while M'Shane and Joey fixed themselves on the box, so covered up in robes of wolf-skins, and wrappers cf bear skins for their feet, that you could see but the tips of their noses.

M'Shane and Joey, with the assistance of the courier, preparing their supper from the stores which they brought with them. After supper they retired, O'Donahue and his wife sleeping in the carriage, which was arranged so as to form abed if required ; while M'Shane and Joey made it out how they could upon the cloaks, and what little straw they could procure, on the floor of the post-house, where, as M'Shane said the next morning, they \"had more bedfellows than were agreeable, although he contrived to get a few hours' sleep in spite of the jumping vagabonds.\" When they rose the next morning, they found that the snow had just begun to fall fast. As soon as they had breakfasted they set out, nevertheless, and proceeded at the same pace, M - telling Joey, who was, as well as himself, almost embedded in it before the day was half over, that it was \"better than rain, at all events : \" to be sure that w7as cold comfort, but any comfort is better than none. O'Donahue's request for M 'Shane me inside was disregarded ; he was as tough as little Joey, at all events, and it would be a pity to interrupt the conversa tion. About four o'clock they had changed their horses at a small village, and were about three miles on their last stage for that day's journey, when they passed through a pine forest. \" There's a nice place for an ambuscade, Joey. isti. ere were any robbers about here,\" observed M'Shane. \" Murder and Irish ! what's those chaps running among the trees so fast, and keeping pace with us ? I say, Dimitri,\" continued M'Shane, point ing to them, \" what are those?\" The courier looked in the direction pointed out, and as soon as he had done so, spoke to the driver, who, casting his eyes hastily in the direction, applied the lash to his horses, and set off with double speed. \" Wolves, Sir,\" replied the courier, who then pulled out his pistols and commenced loading them. \" Wolves! \"said M 'Shane, \"and hungry enough, I'll warrant ; but they don't ike a meal of us, do they ? At all events we will give them a little fight for it. Come, Joey, I see that Dimitri so we must shake off the snow, and ir ammunition ready.\" This was soon done ; the guns were unstrapped from the back of the coach box, the pistols got from beneath nd all were soon ready, ' primed. \"It's lucky there's such a mist on the windows of the carriage, that the lady can't see what we're after, or she'd be frightened, perhaps,\" said Joey. The rapid pace at which the driver had put his horses had for a time left the wolves in the rear ; but now they were seen following the carriage at about a quarter of a mile distant, having quitted the forest and taken to the \"Here they come, the devils! one, two, three \u2014 there are seven of them.

Still the wolves had not oeyond the piece of black cloth which trailed behind the carriage. \" I think that, considering that they are so hungry, they are amazing shy of the bait,\" said M'Shane. \" By all the powers they've stopped again ! \" \"The string has broke, Sir, and they are examining the cloth,\" cried Joey. \" Is there much line left? \" inquired the courier, with some alarm. \"No, it has broken off by rubbing against the edge of the carriage behind.\" The courier spoke to the driver, who now rose from his seat and lashed his horses furiously , but although three of the horses were still fresh, the fourth could not keep up with them, an prospect of his being dragged down on his knees, as more than once he stumble nearly fell. In the mean time the wolves had left the piece of cloth behind them, and were coming up fast with th \" We must fire on them now.

Again the driver lashed furiously, but in vain ; the poor horse was dead beat. \"What is the matter now ?\" inquired iae. \"Do you see that black mass coming down the hill? it's the main pack of wolves ; I fear we are lost ; the horse cannot go on.\" ' ' Then why not cut his traces, and go on with the three others ? \" cried Joey. \" Theboy is right, \"rephed theman. \"and there is no time to lose. \" The courier went"], [52, "36 THE POACHER. down on the sledge, spoke to the driver in Russian, and the horses were pulled up. The courier jumped out with his knife, and commenced cutting the traces of the tired horse, while the other three, who knew that the wolves were upon them, plunged furiously in their harness, that they might id. It was a trying moment. The five wolves now came up ; the first two I .rought down by the guns of M 'Shane and Joey , and O'Donahue killed a third from the carriage windows. One of the others advanced furiously, prung upon the horse which the couriei was cutting free. Joey leapt down, and put his pistol to the animal's head, and blew out his brains, while M'Shane, who had followed our hero, with the other pistol disabled the only wolf that remained. But this danger which they had esi from was nothing compared to that which threatened them ; the whole pack now sweeping like a torrent down the hill, i simultaneous yell which might well strike terror into the bra horse which had fallen down when the wolf seized him was still not clear of the sleigh, and the other three were quite unmanage- M 'Shane, Joey, and the courier, at last drew him clear from the track ; they jumped into their places, and away they started again like the wind, for the horses were maddened with fear.

He warmly greeted O'Donahue, as his con nection, and immediately exerted all the sts which he had at the court to mperor. When the affair first became known, which it soon did, by the Princess not returning to court, his Majesty was anything but pleased at being out witted, but the persuasions of the Empress, the pleading of the English Ambassa dor, who exerted himself strenuously for O'Donahue, with the efforts made in quarters, and, more than all, the letter of -. ahue. proving that the Emperor had given his consent (unwitting]', true), coupled with his wish to enter into his service, at last produced the desired effect, and after two months a notice of their paidon and permission to return was at last depatehed by the Ei. O'Donahue considered that it was best to take immediate advantage of this turn in his favour, and retrace his way to the I.

CHAPTER XVII. THE DAV AFTER THE MURDER. We must now return to the village of ord and tiie cottage in which we left Rushbrook and his wife, who had been raised up from the floor by her hus band, and, having now recovered from her swoon, was crying bitterly for the loss of her son, and the dread of her husband's crime being discovered. For some time Rushbrook remained in silence, look the embers in the grate ; Mum sometimes would look piteously in his master's face, at other times he would slowly approach the weeping woman. The intelligence of the animal told him that something was wrong. Finding himself unnoticed, he would then go to the door by which Joey had qu snuff at the crevice, and return to bis master's side. \" I'm glad that he's off,\" at last mut tered Rushbrook ; \"he's a fine boy that.' \"Yes, he is,\" replied Jane ; \"but when shall I behold him again ?\" ' ' By and by, never fear, wife. We must not stay in this place, provided this affair blows over.\" \" If it does, indeed ! \" ' ' Come, come, J ane, we have every a to hope it will; now, let's go to bed ; it would not do, if any one should happen to have been near the spot, and to have found out what has taken place, for us to be discovered not to have been in bed all night, or even for a light to be seen at the cottage by any early riser. Come, Jane, let's to : Rushbrook and his wife retired, the light was extinguished, and all was quiet, except conscience, which still tormented and kept Rushbrook turning to the right and left ually. Jane slept not ; she listened to the wind ; the slightest noise\u2014 the crow ing of the cock \u2014 startled her, and soon footsteps were heard of those passing the windows. They could remain in bed no longer. Jane arose, diessed, and lighted the fire ; Rushbrook remained sitting on the side of the bed, in deep thought. \" I've been thinking, Jane,\" said he at last, \"it would be better to make with Mum.\" \" With the dog ! Why, it can't speak, poor thing.

This he was oil en in the habit of doing, to call Joey out to accompany him to school. \"Good morning,\" said he; \"now, where's my frienii j ome in, come in, neighbour, and shut the door,\" said Rushbrook; \"I wish to speak to you. Mayhap you'll take a cup of tea ; if so, my missus will give you a good one.\" \"Well, as Mrs. Rushbrook doe; make everything so good, I don't care if I do, ;h I have had breakfast ; but where's iend Joey? the lazy little dog; is he not up yet ?

This conviction qui* t< fears, and when the neighbours cam talk with him, he was very cool and col lected in his replies. In the mean time the keeper made a hasty meal, and, with his subordinates and the dogs, set off to the covers, which they beat till dark without success. The gun, however, which had thrown down in the ditch, had been picked up by one of the labourers returning from his work, and taken by him to the ale-house. None could identify the gun, as Rushbrook had never permitted it to be seen. Lucas, the keeper, came in about an hour after dusk, and immediately took possession of it."], [56, "40 THE POACHER. Such were the events of the first day after Joey's departure. Notwithstanding that the snow fell fast, the Cat and Fiddle was, as it may be supposed, unusually crowded on that night. Various were the surmises as to the disappearance of the pedlar and of little Joey. The keeper openly expressed his opinion that there i V somewhere, and it was not until near midnight that the ale-house was deserted and the doors ele. Rushbrook and his wife went to bed ; tired with watching and excitement, they found oblivion for a few hours in a restless and unrefreshing sleep. CHAPTER XVIII. A CORONER'S INQUEST. Day had scarcely dawned when the keeper and his satellites were again on the search. The snow had covered the ground for three or four inches, and, as the covers had been well examined on the preceding day, they now left them and went on in the direction towards where the gun had been picked up. Thi; brought them direct to the furze bottom, where the dogs appeared to quicken their movements, and when the keepers up with them again, they found them lown by the frozen and stiffened of the pedlar. \" Murder, as I expected,\" said Lucas, as they liftco up die body, and scraped off the snow which covered it ; \"right through his heart, poor fellow; who wou pected this from such a little varmint?

Mrs. Rushbrook, who had been coun selled by her husband, was the first ex amined, but she would not answer any question put to her. She did nothing but j every question her only reply was, \"If he did kilt him it was by acci- my boy would never commit mur der.\" Nothing more was to be obtained from her, and the magistrates \\ moved by her distress that she was dis missed. Rushbrook trembled as he was brought in and saw the body laid out on the table, but he soon recovered himself, and became nerved and resolute, as people often will do in extremity. He had made u mind to answer some questions, but not all. \" Do you know at what time your son left the cottage?\" \" I do that gun belong to you?\" \" Yes, it is mine.\" \" Do you know that bag? \" io me.\" \"It has been used for putting game into ; has it c \" I shall not answer that question.

A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND IN DEED. Rushbrook and Tane returned to their cottage; Jane closed the door, and threw herself into her husband's arms. \"You are saved, at least,\" she cried; \"thank Heaven for that ! You are spared. Alas \\"], [58, "TffE POACHER 42 we do not know how much we l^ve till danger comes upon us.\" Rushbrook was much affected ; he loved his wife, and had good reason to love her. Jane was a beautiful woman, not yet thirty ; tall in her person, her head was finely formed, yet apparently small for her height ; her features were full of expression and sweetness. Had she been born to a high station, she would have been considered one of the greatest belles. As it was, she was loved by those around her ; and there dignity and commanding air about her which won admiration and res No one could feel more deeply than she did the enormity of the offence committed by her husband ; and yet never in any moment since her marriage did she cling so earnestly and so closely by him as she did now. She was of that bold and daring temperament, that she could admire the courage that propelled to the crime, while the crime itself she abhorred. It was not, therefore, anything surprising that, at such a moment, with regard for a husband to whom she was devoted, she thought more of the danger to which he was exposed than she did of the crime which had been committed. To do Rushbrook himself justice, his person and mind w ere of no plebeian mould. He was a daring, venturous fellow, ready at any emergency, cool and collected in danger, had a pleasure in the excitement created by the difficulty and risk attending his nocturnal pursuits, caring little or no thing for the profits. He, as well as his had not been neglected in pc education ; he had been born in humble life, and had, by enlisting, chosen a path by which advancer;. impossible ; but, had Rushbrook been an officer instead of a common soldier, his talents would probably have been directed to more noble channels, and the poacher and pilferer for his captain might have exerted his dexterity so as to have gained honourable mention. His courage had always been remarkable, and he was looked upon by his officers, and so he was by his companions, a. most steady and collected man under sire to be found in the whole company. We are the creatures of circumstances. Frederick of Prussia had no opinion of phrenology, and one day he sent for the professor, and dressing up a highwayman and a pickpocket in uniforms and orders, he desired the phrenologist to examine their heads, and give his opinion as to their qualifications. The savant did so, and, turning to the King, said, \"Sire, this person,\" pointing to the highwayman, \"whatever he may be, would have been a great general, had he been employed. ii the other, he is quite in a different line. He may be, or if he is not, he would make, an admirable financier.\" The King was satisfied that there was some tmth in the science. \"For,\" as he very rightly observed, \"what is a general but a wayman, and what is a financier but a pickpocket?\" \" Calm yourself, dear Jane,\" said Rush brook ; \"all is well now. \" \"All well! yes; but my poor child \u2014 \u00a3200 offered for his apprehension ! if they were to take him ! \" ' ' I have 1.0 fear of that ; and if they did, they could not hurt him ; it is true that they have g' diet, but still they have no positive proof.\" \" But they have hanged people upon less proof before now, Rushbrook.\" \"Jane,\" replied Rushbrook, \"our boy shall never be hanged ; I promise you that ; so make your mind easy.\" \"Then you must confess, to save him, and I shall lose you.\" A step at the door interrupted their colloquy. Rushbrook opened it, and Mr. Furness, the schoolmaster, made his ap pearance. \" Weil, my good friends, I'm very sorry the verdict has been such as it is, but it cannot be helped ; the evidence was too strong, and it was a sad thing for me to be obliged to give mine.\" \u25a0u \u25a0 \" exclaimed Rushbrook, \"why, did they call you up ?\" \" Yes, and put me on my oath. A. ioral man, is a very serious r<: bility ; the nature of an oath is awful ; and you consider my position in this place, as the inculcator of morals and piety to the younger branches of the community, you must not be surprised at my telling the truth.\" \"And what had you to tell?\" inquired Rushbrook, with surprise. \"Had to tell !- why, I had to tell you told me this morning ; and I had to the bag as belonging to you ; for you know you sent me some potatoes in it by little Joey, poor fellow.

The conseo1 his school fell off, and the pedagogue, whenever he couid raise the means, became more intemperate than ever. One Saturday night, Rushbrook, who had ;iiarrel with Furness, went down to the ale-house. Furness was half drunk, and pot valiant Rushbrook taunted him so as to produce replies. One word ton another, till 1 enged \u25a0 ook to come outside and have it \u25a0 his was just what Rushbrook wished, and after half-an-hour Furness was carried home beaten to a mummy, and unable to for niaiiv days.

IN WHICH WE AGAIN FOLLOW UP OUR HERO'S DESTINY. After the resolution that Major M 'Shine came to, it is not to be surprised that he made, during their journey home, every inquiry of Joey relative to his former life. To these Joey gave him a very honest reply in everything except that portion of his history in which h riously implicated ; he had the feeling that he vas bound 'the circum stances connected with the murder of the pedlar. M'Shane was satisfied, and they 1 in London without further ad venture. As soon as M'Shane had ed by his wife, he gave a narrative of his adventures, and did not forget to little Joey as he deserved. Mrs. M'Shane was all gratitude, and then it was that M i iressed his intentions to wards our hero, and, as he expected, he found his amiable wife wholly coincide with him in opinion. It was therefore decided that Joey should be put to a"], [60, "THE POACHER. 44 school, and be properly educated, as soon as an establishment that was eligible could be found. Their full intentions towards him. how ever, were not communicated to our hero ; he was told that he was to go to school, and he willingly submitted ; it was not, however, for three months tbat M'Shane would pail , a difficulty was raised against every establishment that was named. During this time little Joey was very idle, for there was nothing for him to do. Books there were none, for ae had no time to read, and Major M'Shane no inclination. His only resort was to rummage over the newspapers which were taken in for the benefit of the customers, and this was his usual employ ment. One day, in turning over the file, he came to the account of the murder of the pedlar, with the report of the coroner's it. He read all the evidence ticularly that of Furness, the schoolmaster, and found that the verdict was wilful i, with a reward of for his apprehension. The term, wilful murder, he did not exactly com, 1, after laying down the paper, with a beating he went to Mrs. M'Shane, and asked lat was the meaning of it. was then very busy in her occupation, \" it means, child, that a person is believed to be guilty of murder, and, if taken up, :'l be hanged by the neck till he is \"But,\" replied Joey, \"suppose he has not committed the murder?\" ' ' Well then, child, he must prove that rot.\" \"And suppose, although he has not committed it, he cannot prove it ? \" [ercy on me, what a number of sup poses I why, then he will be hanged all the same, to be sure.\" A fortnight after these queries.

At night he went to his room with the oys ; he could only obtain a small i of his clothes, these he put u; handkerchief, went softly downstairs about lock in the morning, put his letter, addressed to M 'Shane, on the hall table, opened the back door, climbed over the play-ground wall, and was again on the road to seek his fortune. But Joey was much improved during the two years since he had quitted his father's house. Before that, he was a reflective boy ; now, he was more capable of action and decision. His ideas had been much expanded from the knowledge of the world gained during his entry, as it were, into life ; he had talked much, seen much, listened much, and thought more; and naturally quiet in his manner, he was now a gentlemanlike boy. At the eating- house he had met with every variety of character ; and as there were some who frequented the house daily, with those Joey had become on intimate terms. He was no longer a child, but a lad of un- daunted courage and presence of mind ; he had only one fear, which was that his . father's crime should be discovered. And now he was again adrift, v. small bundle, three guineas in his pocket, and the world before him. At first he had but one idea, that of removing to a distance which shouid elude thevigilance of Furness, and he therefore walked on, and walked fast. Joey was capable of great fatigue ; he had grown considerably, it is true, during the last two years ; still he was small for his age ; but every muscle in his body was a wire, and his strength, as had been proved by his schoolmates, was pro portionate. He was elastic as India rubber, and bold and determined as one who had been all his life in da CHAPTER XXI. THE SCENE IS AGAIN SHIFTED, AND THE PLOT ADVANCES. It will be necessary that for a short time we again follow up the fortunes of our hero's parents. When Rushbrook aud Jane had quitted the village of Grassford, they had not come to any decision as to their future place of abode ; all that Rushbrook felt was a desire to remove as far as possible from the spot where the crime had been committed. Such is the feeling that will ever possess the guilty, who, although they may increase their distance, attempt in vain lo fly from their consciences, or that all seeing eye which follows them everywhere. fane had a similar feeling, but it rose from aer anxiety for her husband. They wandered iway, for they had sold everything before their departure, until they found themselves"], [62, "46 THE POACHER. m the West Riding of Yorkshire, and there Mh settled in a small village. Rushbrook easily obtained employment, for the population was scanty, and some months passed away without anything occurring of interest. Rushbrook had never taken up his em ployment as a poacher since the night of the murder of the pedlar ; he had abjured it from that hour. His knowledge of raft was, however, discovered, and he was appointed first as under, and ually per to a gentleman of landed propeity in the neighbourhood. In this si 1 iout a year, Rushbrook giving full satisfaction to his employer, and 1 - content (for no man couli on his conscience and not pass occasional hours oi misery and remorse), and Jane was still mourning in secret for her only and darling child, when one day a paper was put into Rushl' s by his master, desiring him to read an adv< it con tained, and which was as follows :\u2014 \" If Joseph Rushbrook, who formerly lived in \"the village of Gr.i_.=sord, in the county of Devon, should be still alive, and wi;i his residence known U 1 Messrs.

Having entered into all the arrangements required by ihe legal gentle men, he returned to Yorkshire, with .\u00a3500 in his pocket, to communicate the intel ligence to his wife ; and when he did so, and embi rst into tears. \"Rushbrook, do not think I mt reproach you by these tears ; but I cannot help thinking that you would have happier had this never happened.

He only thought that the boat must be very full. \" Now, you see that little Peter was her right-hand man, for she can't read and Can you? but of course you can.\" \"Yes, I can,\" replied Joey. \"Weil, little Peter vas holding on by the painter against a head sea, but his strength was not equal to it, and so when a swell took the boat he was pulled right overboard, and he was drowned \" \"Was the painter drowned too?\" in quired Joey. \" Ha! ha! that's capital ; why the painter is a rope.

The room was crowded with seamen and women, but they were too busy talking and laughing to pay any attention to Joey and his comrade. Our little hero sat some litde time at the table after his new acquaintance had left, and then walked out into the street, telling the people of the house that he was coining back again, and requesting them to take care of his bundle. \" You'll find it here, my little fellow, all hen you ask for it,\" said the woman at the bar, who took it inside and put it away under the counter. Joey went out with his mind more at ease. The nature of his new employ mer t, should he succeed in obtaining it, he could scarcely comprehend, but still it appeared to him one that he could accomplish. He amused himself walking down the streets, watching the movements of the passers-by, the watermen in their wherries, and the people on board of the vessels which were lying off in the stream. It was a busy and animating sight. As he was lolling at the landing-place, a boat came on shore, which, from the description given by his young sailor friend, he was convinced was a bumboat ; it had all the articles described by him, as well as many others, such as porter in bottles, a cask probably contain ing beer, leeks, onions, and many other heterogeneous matters ; and, moreover, there was a fat woman seated in the stern. The waterman shoved in with his boat hook, and the wherry grounded. The fat personage got out, and the waterman handed to her a basket, a long boo several other articles, which she ap] to consider indispensable ; among others, a bundle which looked like dirty linen for the wash. \" Dear me ! how shall I get up all these things?\" exclaimed the woman; \"and, William, you can't leave the boat, and there's nobody here to help me.\" \" I'll help you,\" said Joey, coming down the steps; \"what shall I carry for you?\" \"Well, you are a good, kind boy,\" replied she ; \" can you carry that bundle? I'll manage all the rest. ' Joey tossed the bundle on his shoulder 1 ment. you are a strong littl iinan. \" He is a very nice little fellow, and a kind one.

I ,\\ joey was dressed in his sailor's suit, and looked very well in it. He was not only a very good-looking but a gentlemanlike boy in his manners. He went to church, and after church he walked out to ihe abode of his little friend, Emma Phillips. She ran out lo meet him, was delighted with his new clothes, and took him by the hand to present him to her mother. Mrs. Phillips was a quiet-looking, pleasing woman, and the old lady was of a very venerable appearance. They made many inquiries about his friends, and Joey continued in the same story, that he and his father had been poachers, that he had been discovered and obliged to go away, and that he went with the consent of his parents. They were satisfied with his re plies, and prepossessed in his favour ; and as joey was so p daughter, he was desired fo renew his which he occasionally did on Sundays, but preferred meeting Emma on the road from school, and the two children {if Joey could be called a child) became very intii and felt annoyed if they did not evi i exchange a few words. Thus passed the first six months of Joey's new life; the winter was cold, and the h, and he bit rs, while Mrs. Chopper folded her arms up in her apron ; but he had always a good dinner and a warm bed after the day's work was over. He became a great favourite with Mrs. Chopper, who at last admitted that he was much more useful than even Peter ; and William, the waterman, declared that such was really the case, and that he was, in his opinion, worth two of the former Peter, who had come to such an untimely end. CHAPTER XXV. IN WHICH THE BITER IS BIT. The disappearance of Joey from the school wasim - r, who could not imagine how such an incident could have occun such \u25a0 \u25a0 -blishmem as hi paratory seminary ; it was an epoch in his existence, and ever aftei '.rono logy was founded upon it, and everything that occurred was so many mouths or weeks before or after the absconding of young Master M'Shane. The letter had of course been produced, and as soon as the school master had taken his departure, M'Shane and his wife were in deep counsel. \"I recollect,\" said Mrs. M'Shane, who was crying in an easy-chair \u2014 \"I recollect now that one day the boy came up and asked me the meaning of wilful murder, and I told him. And now I think do also remember the people at No. i table, close to the counter, some time ago, talking about a murder having been com mitted by a mere child, and a long report of it in the newspapers. I am sure, how ever (as Joey says in his letter), that he is not guilty.\" \"And so am I,\" replied M'Shane. \" However, bring up the file of newspapers, dear, and let me look over them. How long back do you think it was? \" \u25a0 ' Why, let me see ; it was about the time you went away with Captain O'Donahue, 1 think, or a little before \u2014 that was in October.\" M'Shane turned over the file of news papers, and after <t quarter of an hour's search found the report of the coroner's in ques t. \" Here it is, my dear, sure enough,\" said M 'Shane. As soon as he had read it over, and came to the end, he said, \"Yes; wilful murder at Joseph Rushbrook the younger, and for his apprehension. This it was that drove the boy away from home, and not poaching, although I have no doubt that poaching was the cause of the murder. my dear,\" continued W think I can unravel all this ; the murder has been committed, that's evident, by somebody, but not by Joey, I'll be sworn ; he says that he is not guilty, and I believe him. Nevertheless, Joey runs verdict is found agi Mydear wife, I happen to know the father of Joey well ; he was a fine, bold soldier, but one who would stick at nothing ; and if I could venture an opinion, it is, that the murder immitted by Rushbrook, and not by Y, and that the boy has absconded ther.\" The reader will acknowledge that M'Shane was very clear-sighted. n 1 y opinion, \" continued V\" \" How it has been managed to make the as the party, I cannot tell; but knowing the father, and knowing the son, I'd stake my commission that I've at the truth.\" \"Poor boy ! \" exclaimed Mrs. M'Shane ; 'well, the Commandments say th sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children.

The dear boy was once my tuition, and did me much credit, as I have no doubt that he has done you.\" Now, the usher had told Mr. Slappum iey had been addressed by this person the day before, and the schoolmaster pre suming, of course, that it was Joey M'Shane, replied\u2014\" I am sorry to sav that he left this house last night, and has absconded we know not where. He left a letter for Major M'Shane, which I have this day d>-i to him, acquainting him with the un pleasant circumstance.\" \" Bolted, by all that's clever!\" said the second personage to the first, who looked very much surprised and confounded. \"You really have i-Stonished me, my dear Sir,\" replied the first person, whom the reader will of course recognize to be Furness; \"that a lad brought up by me h strict moral principles, such correct notions of right and wrong, and, I may add, such pious feelings, should have taken such a step, is to me incomprehensible. Major M'Shane, I think you said, lives at ?\" \"Major M'Shane lives at No. \u2014 in Holborn,\" rephed the schoolmaster. \"And the lad has not gone home to him?\" \"No, he has not; he left a letter, which I took to Major M 'Shane ; but 1 didnof break the seal, and am ignorant of its contents.\" \" I really am stupefied with grief and vexation,\" replied Furness, \"and will not intrude any longer. Bless the poor boy ! what can have come of him ? \" ., Furness took his departure with the peace-officer, whom he had in trusted with the warrant, which he had taken out to secure the person of our hero. M Shane heard the schoolmaster's ac count of this visit without interruption, and then said, \" I have no doubt but that this person who has called upon you will pay me a visit ; oblige me, therefoi describing his person particularly, so that I may know him at first sight.\" The schoolmaster gave a most accurate description of Furness, and then took his leave. As the eating-house kept by Mrs. M'Shane had a private door, Furness (who, as M Shane had prophesied, came the next afternoon), after having read the name on the private door, which was not on the eating-house, which went by the name of the Chequers, imagined that it was an establishment apart, and thought it advisable to enter into it, and ascertain a little about Major M'Shane before he called upon him. Although M'Shane seldom made his appearance in the room appropriated for the dinners, it so happened that he was standing at the door when Furness entered and sat down in a box, calling for the bill of fare, and ordering a plate of beef and cabbage. M'Shane re- cognized him by the description given of him immediately, and resolved to make his acquaintance incog., and ascertain what his intentions were; he therefore took his seat in the same box, and winking to one of the girls who attended, also called for a plate of beef and cabbage. Furness, who was anxious to pump any one he might fall in with, immediately entered into con- versation with the Major. ' ' A good house this, Sir, and well at- tended apparently?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" replied M'Shane; \"it is considered a very good house.\" \"Do you frequent it much yourself?\" \" Always, Sir ; I feel much interested in its success,\" replied M'Shane; \"for I know the lady who keeps it well, and have a high respect for her.\" 1 ' I saw her as I passed by \u2014 a fine woman, Sir! Pray may I ask who is Major M'Shane, who I observe lives in the rooms above?\" \"He is a major in the army, Sir\u2014 now on half-pay.\" \" Do you know him?\" \"Remarkably well,\" rephed M'Shane; \" he's a countryman of mine.\" \" He's married, Sir, I think? I'll trouble you so. the pepper.\" \"He is married, Sir, to a very amiable woman. ' ' \"Any family, Sir?\" \"Not that I know of; they have a young prottgi, I beheve, now at school \u2014 a boy they call Joey.\" ' ' Indeed ! how very kind of them ; really,"], [76, "THE POACHER 60 now, it's quite refreshing to me to see so much goodness of heart still remaining in this had world.

As he expected, he found, on his return, that Furness had finished his and was more tipsy than when he left him. The conversation was renewed, and M'Shane again pleading his poverty, and hi; wish to ohtain money, brought out the proposal of Furness, who informed him that he had recognized the protege1 of Major me to be the identical Joseph Rush- brook ; that the boy had absconded from the school, and was concealed in the house.

The serjeant told long stones, c Furness, who was now quite intoxicated, on the back, called him a jolly fellow, and asked him to enlist. \"Say 'yes,' to please him,\" said M'Shane in his ear. Furness did so, received the shilling, and when he came to his senses ty, found his friend had disappeared, and that he was under an escort for Portsmouth.

CHAPTER XXVI. IN WHrCH OUR HERO A^AIN FALLS I i H AN' OLD ACQUAINTANCE. For nearly two years Joey had filled his situation as chancellor of the exchequer to Mrs. Ciiopper. He certainly did not feel himself always in the humour or the dispo sition ! specially during the hard winter months, when, seated almost immovably in the boat during the best portion of the day, he would find his fingers so completely dead, that he could not hold his pen. But there is ni . under any of the powers that be, that has not some drawback. People may say that a sinecure is one that has not its disadvan tages ; but such is not the case \u2014 there is the disgrace of holding it. At all events, place was no sinecure, for he was up early, and was employed the whole of the day. icy, the young woman we have intro duced to our leaders, ::7ed a great regard for our hero, ever since his offering her his money, and Joe equally partial to her, for she possessed a warm heart and much good feeling ; she would very often run upstairs into Mrs. Chopper's room, to talk with the old lady and to see Joey, and would then take out her thimble and needle, examine his clothes, and make the necessar7 \" I saw you walking with little Emma"], [78, "62 THE POACHER, Phillips, Peter,\" said Nancy; \"where did you come to know her?\" ' ' I met her in the road the day that I came down to Gravesend.\" \"Well, I'm sure! and do you speak to every young lady you chance to meet?\" \" No ; but I was unhappy, and she was very kind to me.\" \"She's a very sweet child, or rather, I can only say that she was, when I knew her.\" ' ' When did you know her ? \" \"Four or five years ago; I lived for a short time with Mrs. Phillips; that was when I was a good girl.\" \"Yes, indeed, Nancy,\" said Mrs. Chop per, shaking her head. \"Why aint you good, now, Nancy?\" replied Joey. \" Because \" said Nancy. ' ' Because why ? ' ' \"Because I am not good,\" replied the girl ; \"and now, Peter, don't ask any more questions, or you'll make me cry. Heigho ! I think crying very pleasant now and then ; one's heart feels fresher, like flowers after the rain. Peter, where are your father and mother?\" \" I don't know ; I left them at home.\" \"You left them at home ! but do you never hear from them ? do you never write?\" No. \" But, why not? I am sure they have brought you up well.

D'ye think the young man will kill you all three, that you must put the darbies on so At this appeal the serjeant and privates looked up at the window, and laughed when they saw such a pretty girl as Nancy. The eyes of one of the privates were, however, soon fixed on our hero's face, and deeply scrutinizing it, when Joey looked at hini. As soon as Joey recognized him, he drew back from the window, pale as death, the private still remaining staring at the window. \" V. the matter, Peter?\" said Nancy; \" what makes you look so pale? nan?\" ' Yes,\" replied j ey, drawing his breath, \"and he knows me, I'm afrajd.\" i you fear? \" replied Na.1* if he's gone,\" said Joey. \" Yes, he has ; he has gone up the street with the serjeant ; but every now and then he looks back at this window ; but perhaps that's to see i harm can marine do you?\" inquired Mrs. Chopper. \"A great deal ; he will never be quiet"], [79, "THE POACHER. 63 until he has me taken up, and then what will become of my poor father?\" continued Joey, with the tears running down his cheeks. my bonnet, Peter. I'll soon find out what he is after,\" said Nancy, leaving the window. She threw her bonnet on her head, and ran downstairs. Mrs. Chopper in vain endeavoured to console our hero, or make him explain \u2014 he did nothing but sit mournfully by her side, thinking what he had best do, and ex pecting every minute to hear the tramp of Furness (for it was he who had recognized Joey) coming up the stairs. \" Mrs. Chopper,\" at last said Joey, \"I ive you, I'm afraid ; I was obliged to leave my former friends on this man's account. \" \" Leave me, boy ! no, no, you must not leave me \u2014 how could I get on without you?\" \" If I don't leave you myself, I shall be taken up, that is certain ; but indeed I have not done wrong \u2014 don't think that I t \" I'm sure of it, child ; you've only to say I I'll believe you ; but why should he care about you?\" ' ' He lived in our village, and knows all about it ; he gave evidence at \u2014 \" \u25a0vhat, hoy ?\" t the time that I ran away from home; he proved that I had the gun and bag which were found.\" \"Well, and suppose you had ; what then ?\" \"Mrs. Chopper, there was a reward offered, and he wants to get the money.\" \" O, I see now \u2014 a reward offered ; then it y said ; there was blood hopper put her apron up to her eyes. Joey made no answer. After a few nee, he rose and went to his room where he slept, and put his clothes up in a bundle Having so done, he sat down on the side of his bed and reflected what was the course he ought to pursue. Our hero was now sixteen, and much in creased in stature ; he was no longer a child, although, in heart, almost as innocent. His thoughts wandered \u2014 he yearned to see his father and mother, and reflected whether ight not venture back to the vi and meet them by stt ilth ; he thought of the M Shanes, and imagined that he might in the : .turn to them ; then little Emma Phillips rose in his imagination, and he should never see her again ; \u25a0 \u00bbonahue was at last brought to his recollection, and he longed to be once more with him in Russia ; and, lastly, he ed the happy and contented life he had lately led with his good friend Mrs. Chopper, and how sorry he should be to part with her. After a time he threw him self on his bed and hid his face in the pillow ; and, overcome with the excess of his feelings, be at last fell fast asleep. In the mean time Nancy had followed the marines up the street, and saw them enter, with their prisoner, into a small public house, where she was well known ; she followed them, spoke a few kind words to the seaman who had been apprehended, and with whom she was acquainted, and then sat down by Furness to attract his attention. Furness had certainly much improved ia his appearance since he had (much against his will) been serving his Majesty. Being a tall man, he had, by drilling, become per fectly erect, and the punishment awarded to drunkenness, as well as the difficulty of procuring liquor, had kept him from his former intemperance, and his health had in consequence improved. He had been more than once brought up to the gangway upon his first embarkation, but latterly had con ducted himself properly, and was in expecta tion of being made a corporal, for which situation his education certainly qualified him. On the whole, he was now a fine looking marine, although just as unprinci pled a scoundrel as ever. \"Well, my pretty lass, didn't I see you looking out of window, just now\"* \" \"To be sure you did, and you might have heard me too,\" replied Nancy ; \" and when I saw such a handsome fellow as you, didn't I put on my bonnet in a hurry, and come after you? What ship do you belong to?\" \" The Mars, at the Nore.\" ell, I should like to go on board of a man-of-war. Will you take me?\" ' ' To be sure I will ; come, have a drink of beer.\" \"Here's to the jollies,\" said Nancy, putting the pewter pot to her lips. \"When do you go on board again ? \" \"Not till to-morrow; we've caught our bird, and now we'll amuse ourselves a little. Do you belong to this place?\" ' ' Yes, bred and born here ; but we hardly ever see a man-of-war ; they stay at the Nore, or go higher up.\" Nancy did all she could to make Furness believe she had taken a fancy to him, and knew too well how to succeed. Before an hour had passed, Furness had, as he thought, made every arrangement with her, and congratulated himself on his good fortune. In the mean time the beer and brandy went round, even the unfortunate captive was persuaded to drink with them,"], [80, "64 THE POACHER. and drown reflection. At last Furness said to Nancy, ' that lad that was looking out of window with you? Was it your brother?\" \"My brother ! bless you, no. You mean that scamp Peter, who goes in the bumboat with old mother Chopper.\" \"Does he? \u2014 well I have either seen him before, or some one like him. \" \" He's not of our town,\" replied Nancy ; \"he came here about two years ago, no body knows where from, and has been with Mrs. Chopper ever since.\" \"Two years ago,\" muttered Furness, \"that's just the time. Come, girl, take some more bi Nancy drank a little and put down the pot. \"Where does Mrs. Chopper live?\" in quired Furness, \" V. me looking out of the window,\" replied Nancy. \"And the boy lives with her? I will call upon Mrs. Chopper by-and-by.\" \" Yes, to be sure he does ; but why are you talking so about the boy ? Why don't you talk to me, and tell me what a pretty girl 1 am, for I like to be told that.\" Furness and his comrades continued the :, and were getting fast into a stale of intoxication; the serjeant only was prudent; but Furness could not lei this opportunity of indulging without fear of punishment. He became more loving more tipsy ; when Nancy, who cajoled him to the utmost of her power, again mentioned our hero ; and then it was that Furness, who inebriated could never hold a secret, fir__t told h a reward offered . apprehension, and tha* if she would re main with him they would spend the money r To this Nancy immediately con sented, and offered to assist him as much could, as she had the entrance into Mrs. Chopper's house, and knew the lad slept But Nancy was determined to gain more from Furness, and as he was now pretty far gone, she proposed that should take a walk out, for it beautisui evening. Furness gladly con sented. Nancy again explained tc how she should manage to get Joey into her power, and appeared quite delighted at the idea of there being a reward, they were to obtain ; and finding that Furness was completely deceived, and that the fresh air had increased his inebriety, she then persuaded him to con all the circumstances connected with the reward offered for our hero's apprehension. She then learned what had occurred at the inquest \u2014 Joey's escape \u2014 his being again discovered by Furness \u2014 and his second escape from the school, to which he had been put by the M 'Shanes. \"And his father and mother, wh ere are they? When I think of them I must say that I do not much like to assist in taking up the boy. Poor people, ho suffer when they hear of it ! Really I don't know what to say,\" continued Nancy, biting the tip of her finger as if hesital \" Don't let them stop you,\" said Furness ; \" they will not be likely even to hear of it ; they left the village before me, and no one knows where they are gone.

Mari upstairs and changed her dress ; and now that she had completed her arrangements, she looked a very pretty, modest young woman, and none could have supposed that the day before she had been flaunting in the street of a seafaring town. Inquiries were made, as might be supposed, and Mary replied that she was going to service, and that her brother was escorting her. They had their breakfast, and, after resting two hours, they proceeded on their journey. For some days they travelled more de liberately, until they found themstr the village of Manstone, in Dorsetshire, where they, as usual, put up at an humble public-house. Here Mary told a different story; she had been disappointed in a situation, and they intended to go back to their native town. The landlady of the hotel was pre possessed in savour os such a very pretty girl as Mary, as well as with the appearance of Joey, who, although in his sailor's dress, tenor in carriage and manners is supposed station in life, and t if they would remain there a lays, she would try to procure them ii tua tion. The third day after their she informed Mary that she had heard of a situation as under-housemaid at a mile off, if she would like to take it, and Mary gladly consented. Mrs. Derborough sent up word, and re ceived orders for Mary to make her ap- tce, and Mai igly went up to the hall, accompanied by Joey. When she arrived there, and made known her business, she was desired to wait in the servants'-hall until she was sent for. In about a quarter of an hour she was sum moned, and, leaving Joey in the hall, she went up to see the lady of the house, who inquired whether she had ever been out at service before, and if she had a good character. Mary replied that she had never been out at service, and that she had no character at all (which, by the bye, was very true). The lady of the house smiled at this ap parently naive answer from so very modest looking and pretty a girl, and asked who her parents were. To this question Mary's answer was ready, and she further added, that she had left home in search of a place, and had been disappointed ; that her father and mother were dead, but her brother was down below, and had escorted her ; and that Mrs. Chopper was an old friend of her mother's, and could answer as to her character. The lady was prepossessed by Mary's appearance, by the report of Mrs. Der- ,h, and by the respectability of her broil er travelling with her, and agreed to ; but at the .aid she must have Mrs. Chopper 's address, that she might write to her ; but, the place being vacant, she might come to-morrow morn ing ; her wages were named and immedi ately accepted, and thus did Mary obtain her situation. People say you cannot be too particular when you choose servants ; and, to a certain degree, this is true ; but this extreme cau tion, however selfishness and prudence may dictate it, is but too often the cause of servants, who have committed an error and have in consequence been refused a character, being driven to destitution and misery, when they had a full intention, and would have, had they been permitted, re deemed their transgression. Mary was resolved to be a good and honest girl. Had the lady of the house been very particular, and had others to whom she might afterwards have applied been the same, all her good intentions might have been frustrated, and she might have been driven to despair, if not to her former evil courses. It is perhaps fortunate \u25a0 -erybody in the world i- not so particular as your very good people, and that there is an occasional loop-hole by which those who have erred are permitted"], [84, "68 THE POACHER. to return to virtue. Mary left the room delighted with her success, and went down to Joey in the servants'-hall. The servants soon found out from Mary that she was coming to the house, and one of the men chucked her under the chin and told her .as a very pretty girl. Mary back, and Joey immediately resented the liberty, stating that he would n< man to insult his sister ; for Jo enough to see that he could not do a better thing to serve Mary.

So Joey and Mary quitted the hall, and bent their way back to the village inn. \"Well, Mary,\" said Joey, \"I am very glad that you have found a situation.\" \"And so I am very thankful indeed, Joey,\" replied she, \"and only hop. you will be able to get one some about here also, and then we may occasion ally see something of one another.\" \" No, Mary,\" replied Joey, \" I shall not look for a situation about here ; the onl) reason I had for wishing it was, that I might see you ; but that will be impossible now.\" \"Why so?\" \"Do you think that 1 will ever put my foot into that house again, after the manner I was treated to-day?

Joey refused to take more of the money than what he had in his possession, but promised, in case of need, to apply to Mary, who said that she would hoard up everything for him, and she kept her word. Joey, having escorted Mary to the hall-lodge, remained at the inn till the morning, and then set off once more on his tr; Our hero started at break of day, and had walked, by a western road, from Man stone, about six miles, when he met two men coming towards him. They were most miserably clad, neither of them had shoes or stockings ; one had only a waist coat and a pair of trousers, with a sack on his back ; the other had a pair of blue trousers, torn lo ribbons, a Guernsey frock, and a tarpaulin hat ; they appeared what they represented themselves to be, when they demanded charity \u2014 two wrecked sea men, who were travelling to a nor port to obtain employment ; but had these n questioned by a sailor, he would soon have discovered, by their total ignorance of anything nautical, that they i npostors. Perhaps there is no more successful than this, which is now carried on ro on enormous extent by a set of rogues and depredators, who occasion- but too often extort it, and add to their spoils by robbing and plundering everything in their way. It is for people in this country to ascertain the truth of the assertions of these vagabonds, and it appears unfeeling to refu ce to a poor seaman who .si his all; even the cottager offers ae, and thus do they levy upon the public to an extent which is scarcely cre dible ; but it should be known that, in all invari ably relieved and decently clothed, and supplied wid. the means of travelling to loyment : and, whenever a man appeals for charity in a half-naked state, he is invariably an impostor or a worthless scoundrel. The two talking loud, and roached our hero. As soon as they came near, tl hard at him. and stopped rightbefore him, block up the foot; \" Hilloah. my little sailor ! where are you bound to ? \" said one to Joey, who had his e. miiion sailor's dress on."], [85, "THE POACHER. 69 d.

As soon as they had made their breakfast, Joey rose up and said \u2014 \"I must go on now ; I hope you'll find yourself better to morrow.\" \"Are you in a very great hurry, my lad? \" inquired the tinker. \" I want to find some employment,\" re plied Joey; \"and, therefore, 1 must look for it.\" \"Tell me what employment you want.

I handed the to the master and mistress, the head : and parlour boarders, but was not allowed myself; I taught Latin and Greek, 1 nglish Grammar, to the little boys, made faces at me, and put crooked pins on the bottom of my chair ; I walked at the head of the string when they went out for an airing, and walked upstairs the hen it was time to go to bed. I had all the drudgery, and none of the comfotts ; I was up first, and held answerable for all deficiencies ; I had to examine all their nasty little trousers, and y con- iori with the botcher, as to the pos sibility of repairs ; to run out if a hen it the boys should not get the egg. to wipe the noses of my mistress's children, and carry them if they roared ; to pay for all broken glass, if I could not discover the culprit ; to account for all bad smelts, for all noise, and for all ink spilled ; lie all the pens, and to keep one hundred boys silent and attentive at church : for all which, with deductions, I received a-year, and found my own washing. I stayed two years, during which time I contrived to save about \u00a36 ; and with that, one fine morning, I set off on my travels, fully satisfied that, come what would, I could not change for the worse.\" \"Then you were about in the position that I'm in now,\" said Joey, laug \"Yes, thereabouts ; only a little older, I should imagine.

At last I obtained a situation as waiter, at a posting house on the road, where I ran along all day long to the tinkling of bells, with hot brandy-and-water ever under my nose; I answered all the bells, but the head-waiter took all the money. However, I made acquaintances there ; and at last obtained a situation as clerk to a corn chandler, where I kept the books ; but he"], [88, "THE POACHER. 72 failed, and then I was handed over to the miller, and covered with flour for the whole time I was in his service. I stayed there till I had an offer from a coal-merchant (that was going from white to black) ; but, however, it was a better place. Then, by mere chance, I obtained the situation of clerk on board of a fourteen-gun brig, and cruised in the Channel for six months ; but, as I found that there was no chance of being a purser, and as I hated the confine ment and discipline of a man-of-war, I cut and run as soon as I obtained my pay.

I have nearly come to the end of my beat ; in two days we shall be at Dudstone, where I have my room, and where we shall probably remain for some days before we start again.\" In the afternoon they arrived at a small hamlet, where they supped and slept. Spikeman was very busy till noon grinding and repairing; they then continued their journey, and on the second day, having I outside the town till it was dusk, Spikeman left his wheel in the charge of the landlord of a small ale-house, to whom he appeared well known, then walked with Joey to the house in which he had a room, and led him upstairs to his apartments. When our hero entered the chamber of Spikeman, he was very much surprised to find it was spacious, light, and airy, and very clean. A large bed was in one corner ; a sofa, mahogany table, chest of drawers, and chairs, composed the furniture ; there was a good-sized looking-glass over the books round the room. Desiring Joey to sit down and take a book, Spikeman rang for water, shaved off his beard, wliich had nearly half an inch long, washed himself, and then put on clean linen, and a very ne.it suit of clothes. When he was pletely dressed, Joey could hardly believe that it was the same person. Upon Joey expressing his astonishment, Sj plied, \"You see, my lad, there is no one in this town who knows what my real pro fession is. I always go eut and return at dusk, and the travelling tinker is not re cognized ; not that I care for it so much, do, and I respei prejudices. They know that I am in the ironmongery line, and that is all; so I s make it a rule to enjoy myself after my circuit, and live like a gentleman till part of my money is gone, and then I set out again. I am acquainted with a good many highly respectable people in town, and that is the reason why I could be of service to you. Have yo better clothes?\" Yes ; much better.\" \"Then dress yourself in them, and keep those you wear for our travels.\" Joey did as he was requested, and Spike man then proposed that they should make a call at a friend's, where he would intro duce our hero as his nephew. They set off, and soon came to the front of a neat looking house, at the door of which Spike man rapped. The door was opened by one of the daughters of the house, who, on seeing him, cried out, \"Dear me, Mr. Spikeman, is this you? Why, where have you been all this while?\" \"About the country for orders, Miss Amelia,\" replied Spikeman; \"business must be attended to.\" \" Well, come in ; mother will be glad to see you,\" replied the girl, at the same time opening the door of the sitting-room for them to enter. \"Mr. Spikeman, as I live!\" exclaimed another girl, jumping up, and seizing his hand. \"Well, Mr. Spikeman, it's an age since we have seen you,\" said the mother, \" so now sit down and tell us all the r and, Ophelia, my love, get tea ready ; and who is it you have with you, Mr. Spike man?\" \" My little nephew, madam ; he is about to enter into the mysteries of the cutlery trade.\" \"Indeed! well, I suppose, as you are looking out for a successor, you soon intend t-> retire from business and take a wife, Mr. nan ? \" \"Why, I suppose it will be my fate one of these days,\" replied Spikeman; \"but that's an affair that requires some consideration.\" \" Very true, Mr. Spikeman, it is a serious affair,\" replied the old lady; \"and I can assure you that neither my Ophelia n.ir Amelia should marry a man, with my a, without I was convinced the man considered it a very serious It makes or mars a man, as the is.\" Miss Ophelia i read all the books I lent you the last time I was here?\" \"Yes, that they have, both of tl replied the old lady ; \" they are so fond of poetry.\" \u25a0 e've often wished that you were here to read to us,\" replied Miss Amelia,"], [91, "THE POACHER. 75 \"you do read so beautifully ; will you read after tea?\" rtainl) with much pleasure.\" - Ophelia now entered with the lea- she and her sister then went in kitchen to make some toast, and to see to the kettle boiling, while Mr. Spikeman continued in conversation with the mother. Mrs. James was the widow of a draper in the town, who had, at his death, left her sufficient to live quietly and respectably with hei daughters, who were both very good, amiable girls ; and, it must be ac knowledged, neither of them unwilling to listen to the addresses of Mr. Spikeman, e been so inclined; but they began to think that Mr. Spikeman was not a marrying man, which, as the reader must know by this time, was the fact. The evening passed very pleasantly. 1 r. Spikeman took a i poetry, and, as Miss Ophelia had said, he did read very beautifully : so much so, that Joey was in admiration, for he had never yet known the power produced by good reading. At ten o'clock they took their leave, and returned to Spikeman's donn '\u2022on as i hey were upstairs, and candles i, Spikeman sat down on the sofa. \"You see, Joey,\" said he. \"thai it is ne cessary not to mention the knife-grinder's wheel, as it would make a difference in my reception. All gentlemen do not gaii livelihood as honestly as I do ; but, still, prejudices are not i be overcome.

Spike man lived in a very comfortable way, very different to what he did as a tra tinker ; and he really appeared to Joey to be, with th<r- exception of his conversation, which was always superior, a very different from what he was when J< fell in with him. ays they re mained at Dudstone, visiting at different I v-iys well received.

No, no, boy ; I have tried almost every thing, and have come to my own con clusions. Have you been reading the book I gave you?\" \" Yes ; I have nearly finished it.\" \" I am glad to see that you like reading. Nothing so much improves or enlarges the mind. You must never let a day pass with out reading two or thre^ hours, and when we travel again, and are alone by the way side, we will read together ; I will choose some books on purpose.\" \" I should like very much to write to my sister Mary,\" said Joey. \"Do so, and tell her that you have em ployment ; but do not say exactly' how. There is paper and pens in the drawer. Stop, I will find them so- i. Iceman went to the drawer, and when taking out the pens and paper, laid hold of some manuscript writing. \"By-the-bye,\" said he, laughing, \"I told you, Joey, that I had been a captain's clerk on board the Weasel, a fourteen-gun brig ; I wrote the captain's despatches for him ; and here are two of them of which I kept copies, that jht laugh over them occasionally.

We were cruising off the coast of France, close in to Ushant, where we per ceived a fleet of small vessels, called chasse mardes (coasting luggers,) laden with wine, coming round ; and, as we did not know of any batteries thereabouts, we ran in to attempt a capture. We cut off three of them ; but just as we had compelled them, by firing broadsides into them, to lower their sails, a battery, which our commander did not know anything of, opened fire upon I before we could get out of range, ve did as soon as we could, one shot came in on deck, and cut the topsail hal yard's fall, at the very time that the men hoisting the sail ffor we had been shaking another reef out), and the rope being divided, as the men were hauling upon it, of course they all tumbled on the deck, one over the other. The other shot struck our foremast, and chipped off a large slice, besides cutting away one of the"], [92, "THE POACHER. 76 shrouds, and the signal halyards. Now, you do not know enough about ships to understand that there was very little harm done, or that the coasting vessels were very small, with only three or four men on board of each of them ; it thereto quired some little management to make a flamno.

Mary's reply came before Joey's de parture. She stated that she was comfort able and happy, that her mistress was very kind to her, but that she felt that the work was rather too much ; however, she would do her duty to her employers. There was much good advice to Joey, much affection ate feeling, occasioral recurrence to past scenes, and thankfulness that she was no longer a disgrace to her parents and her sex ; it was an humble, grateful, contrite, and affectionate effusion, which did honour to poor Mary, and proved that she was sincere in her assertions of continuing in the right path, and dotingly attached to our hero. Joey read it over and over again, and shed tears of pleasure as he recalled the scenes which had passed. Poor Joey had lost his father and mother, as he sup posed, for ever ; and it was soothing to the boy's feelings to know that there were some people in the world who loved him ; and he remained for hours thinking of Mary, Mrs. Chopper, and his good and kind friends, the M 'Shanes. Two days after the receipt of Mary's letter, Spikeman and Joey went to the houses of their various acquaintances and bade them adieu, announcing their inten tion to set off on the circuit. Spikeman paid up everything, and put away many articles in his room which had been taken out for use. Joey and he then put on their travelling garments, and, waiting till it was dusk, locked the chambers and set off to the little public-house, where the knife grinder's wheel had been deposited. Spike man had taken the precaution to smudge and dirty his face, and Joey, at his request, had done the same. When they entered the public-house, the landlord greeted Spikeman warmly, and asked him what he had been about. Spikeman replied that, as usual, he had been to see his old mother, and now he must roll his grindstone a bit. After drinking a pot of beer at the kitchen- fire, they retired to bed ; and the next morning, at daylight, they once more proceeded on their travels. . CHAPTER XXIX. IN WHICH THE TINKER FALLS IN LOVE WITH A LADY OF HIGH DEGREE. For many months Spikeman and our hero travelled together, during which time Joey had learned to grind a knife or a pair of scissors as well as Spikeman himself, and took most of the work off his hands ; they suited each other, and passed their time most pleasantly, indulging themselves every day with a few hours' repose and reading on the wayside. One afternoon, when it was very sultry, they had stopped and ensconced themselves in a shady copse by the side of the road, not far from an old mansion, which stood on an eminence, when Spikeman said, \"Joey, I think we are intruding here ; and, if so, may be forcibly expelled, which will not be pleasant ; so roll the wheel in, out of sight, and then we may indulge in a siesta, which, during this heat, will be very agreeable.\" \" ' What's a siesta ? \" said Joey. \"A siesta is a nap in the middle of the day, universally resorted to by the Spaniards, Italians, and, indeed, by all the inhabitants of hot climates; with r. able people it is called a siesta, bu. travelling tinker it must be, I suppose, called a snooze.\" \"Well, then, a snooze let it be,\" said Joey, taking his seat on the turf by Spike man, in a reclining position. They had not yet composed them to sleep, when they heard a female voice singing at a little distance. The evidently proceeded from the pleasure grounds which were between them and the mansion. \"Hush!\" said Spikeman, putting up his finger, as he raised himself on his elbow. . party evidently advanced nea' them, and carolled, \\.\\ very beautiful tones, the song of Ariel\u2014 \" Where the bee sucks, there lurk I, In the cowslip's bell I lie,\" &c. \" Heigho 1 \" exclaimed a soft voice, after the song had been finished; \"1 wish I could creep into a cowslip bell Arnminta, you are not i n the yet ; it appears you are in no hurry, so I'll begin my new book.\" After this soliloquy there was silence."], [95, "THE POACHER, 79 nan made a sign to Joey to remain nd then, creeping on his hands arrived as far as -ther side of the copse.

You know I prefer riding a spirited horse to a quiet one ; and, if I were to marry, I should like a husband who would give me some trouble to manage ; I think I master him.\" \"So have many thought before vou, Melissa, but they have been mistaken.\" \"Yes, because they have attempted it by meekness and submission, thinking to disarm by that method. It never mil do, any more than getting into a passion. When a man gives up his liberty, he does make a great sacrifice \u2014 that I'm sure of \u2014 and a woman should prevent him feeling that he is chained to her.\" \"And how would you manage that?\" said Araminta. \" By being infinite in my variety, always cheerful, and, instead of permitting him to stay at home, pinned to my apron-string, order him out away from me, join his amusements, and always have people in the house that he liked, so as to avoid being too much tUe-d-tete, The caged ever wants to escape ; open the doors and let him take a flight, and he will come back of his own accord. Of course, I am supposing my gentleman to be naturally good-hearted and good-tempered. Sooner than marry what you call a steady, sober man, I'd run away with a captain of a privateer. And, one thing more, Araminta, I never would, passionately, distractedly fond as I might be, acknowledge to my husband the extent of my devotion and affection for him. I would always have him to suppose that I could still love him better than what I yet did \u2014 in short, that there was more to be gained ; for, depend upon it, when a man is assured that he has nothing more to gain, his attentions are over. You can't expect a man to chase nothing, you know.\" \"You are a wild girl, Melissa; I only hope you will marry well.\" \" I hope I shall ; but I can tell you this, that, if I do make a mistake, at all events, my husband will find that he has made a mistake also.

And so now we will begin our new book.\" Miss Melissa now commenced reading; and Spikeman, who had not yet seen the faces of the two young ladies, crept softly nearer to the side cf the copse, so as to enable him to satisfy his curiosity. In this position he remained nearly an hour, when the book was closed, and the young ladies returned to the houi> again singing as she went. \"Joey,\" said Spikeman,\" I did not think that there was such a woman in existence as that girl ; she is just the idea that I have formed of what a woman ought to be ; I must find out who she is ; I am in love with her, and \" \" \u2014 Mean to make her a tinker's bride,\" replied Joey, laughing. \"Joey, I shall certainly knock you down, if you apply that term to her. Co us go iO the village, it is close at hand.\" As soon as they arrived at the village, Spikeman went into the ale-house. During the remainder of the day, he was in a brown study, .and Joey amused himself with a book. At nine o'clock the company all quitted the tap-room, and then Spikeman entered into conversation with the hostess. In the course of conversa tion, she informed him that the mansion belonged to Squire Mathews, who had formerly been a great manufacture who had purchased the place ; that the old gentleman had long suffered from the gout, and saw no company, very bad for the village ; that Miss Melissa was his daughter, and he had a son, who was with his regiment in India, and, it was said, not on very good terms with his father; that the old gentleman and choleric because he was alwa; pain ; but that every one spoke well ol Melissa and Miss Araminta, her cousin, who were both very kind to the poor people. Having obtained these particu lars, Spikeman went to bed ; he slept little that night, as Joey, who was his bed-fellow, could vouch for ; for he allowed Joey no r, turning and twisting round in the bed every two minutes. The next morning they arose early and proo way. \"Joey,\" said Spikeman, after an hour's silence, ' ' I have been thinking a great iu.\" \"So I suppose, for you certainly were not sleeping.\" \"No, I could not sleep; the fact is, Joey, I am determined to have that girl, Mathews, if I can ; a bold attempt for a tinker, you will say, but not for a gentleman born as I was. 1 thought I never should care for a woman ; but there is a current in the affairs of mer. I shall now drift with the current, and if it leads to fortune, so much the better , if not, he who dares greatly, does greatly. I convinced that I should mak . iiall not be my fault if I do not gain her.\" \" Do you mean to propose in form with your foot on your wheel ? \" \" No, saucebox, I don't ; bu*. I mean to turn my knife-grinder's wheel into a wheel of fortune ; and, with your help, I will do so.\" \"You are sure of my help, if you are serious,\" replied Joey; \"but how you are to manage 1 cannot comprehend.\" \" I have already made out a programme, although the interw eaving of the plot is not yet decided upon ; but I must get to the next town as fast as I can, as I must make preparations.\" On arrival, they took up humble quarters as usual ; and then Spikeman went to a stationer's, and told them that he had got a commission to execute for a lady. He bought sealing-wax, a glass sea', \" Esperance \" as a motto, gilt-edged note paper, and several'other requisites in the stationery line, and ordered them to be packed up carefully, that he might nol soil , he then purchased scented soap, a hair-brush, and other articles for the toilet; and having obtained all these requisites, he added to them one or two pair of common beaver gloves, and then went to the barber's to get his hair cut. \"I am all ready now, Joey,\" said he, i he returned to the ale-house ; \"and to-morrow we retrace our - \"What! back to the village?\" ' ' Yes ; and where we shall remain some time i reaching the village next me Spikeman hired a bed-room, and, Ii Joey to work the grindstone, remained in his apartments. returned in the evening, he found Spikeman had been very busy with the soap, and his hands ta proper r ; he had i 7>niself, and d his haii well.

PLOTTING, READING, AND WRITING. Spikeman was up early the next morning. When they had breakfasted, he desired Joey to go for the knife-grinder's wheel, and follow Im ii. As soon as the, clear of the village, Spikeman said, \"It will not do to remain at the village ; there's a cottage half a mile down the road, where they once gave me a lodging ; we must try if we can get it now.\" \u25a0n they arrived at the cottage, Spike man made a very satisfactory bargain for board and lodging for a -.ating that they charged so much at the village ;se, that he could not afford to stay there, and that he expected to nave a good job at Squire Mathews's, up at the mansion- As soon as this arrangement was completed, they returned back to the copse near to the mansion-house, Joey rolling the knife-grinder's wheel. \u2022u see, Joey,\" said Spikeman, \"the ling necessary will be to stimulate curiosity; we may have to wait a day or two before the opportunity may occur, but, if necessary, I will wait a month. That vs will vr-ry often be found on Lt by the copse, either alone or with her cousin, I take to be certain, as all iave their favourite retreats. I do not intend that they should see me yet ; I must make an impression first. Now, i the outside, and come with me ; do not speak.\" As soon as they were in the copse, man leconnoitred very carefully, to of the young ladies were on the bench, and finding no one there, he returned to Joey. \" They cannot come without our hearing their footsteps, \" said bpikemm ; \" so now ntly. threw himself down on the turf in front of the copse, and Joey followed his example. |oey, we may as w:ell read a little to pass away the time ; I have b :mes of Byron with me.\" For half-an-hour they were thus occ when they heard the voice of Miss Mathews singing as before as she came down the walk. Spikeman rose and peeped through the foliage. \"She is alone,\" said he, \"whi u I wished. Now, Joey, I am going to read to you aloud.\" Spike man then began to read in the masterly style which we have before referred to : \u2014 \" ' I loved, and was beloved again : \u25a0 , you never knew e gentle frailties: istis true I shorten all my joys and pain To you 'tw' nd as vain ; -ri.' not born to reign, is you There, o'er themselves and nations too. I am, or rather uns, a Prince, ief of thousands and could lead Them on when each would I But would not o'er n The like control. Uut to resume : I loved, and was beloved a . In soo'h it is a happy doom \u2014 But yet where happiness ends in pain.\" \" I am afraid that is but too true, my dear boy.\" said Spikeman, laying down the book; \" Shakspere has most truly said, 'The course of true love never did run smooth.' Nay, he cannot be said to be original in that idea, for Horace and most of the Greek and Latin poets have said much the same thing before him ; ho let us go on again \u2014 \" 'We met in secret, and the hour Which led me to my lady's bower Was fiery expectation's dower ; The days and nights were nothing \u2014 all \\ Inch doth recall, In .he ioi.a; lapse from youth to age, No other like itself.' \" Do you observe the extreme beauty of that passage ? \" said Spikeman. \"Yes,\" said Joey, \" it is very beautiful.\" \" You would more feel the power of it, my dear boy, if you were in love, but your time is not yet come ; but I am afraid we must leave off now, for I expect letters of consequence by the post, and it is useless, I fear, waiting here. Come, put the book by, and let us take up the wheel of my sad fortunes.\" Spikeman and Joey rose on their feet. Joey went to the knife-grinder's wheel, and Spikeman followed him without looking back ; he heard a rustling, never; among the bushes, which announced to him that his manoeuvre had succeeded ; and, as soon as he was about fifty yards from the road, he took the wheel from Joey, desiring him to look back, as if ac cidentally. Joey did so, and saw Miss Mathews foUowing them with her e- \"That will do,\" observed Spikeman; \" her curiosity is excited, and that is all I wish.\" What Spikeman said was correct. Ara-"], [98, "THE POACHER. 82 minta joined Miss Mathews shortly after Spikeman and Joey had gone a \" My dear Araminta,\" said Melissa, \" such an adventure ! I can hardly credit my senses.\" \"Why, what is the matter, dear cousin?\" \" Do you see that man and boy, with a knife-grinder's wheel, just in sight now ? \" \"Yes, to be sure I do; but what of them ? Have they been insolent? \" \"Insolent! thev never saw me ; tin no idea that I was here. I heard voices as I came down the walk, so I moved softly, and when I gained the seat, there was somebody reading poetry so beauti fully ; I never heard any one read with such correct emphasis and clear pronunci ation. And then he stopped, and talked to the boy about the Greek and Latin poets, and quoted Shakspere. There must be some mystery.\" \"Well, but if there is, what has that to do with the travelling tinkers?\" \" What ! why it was the travelling tinker himself, dearest ; but he cannot be a tinker ; for I heard him say that he expected letters of consequence, and no travelling tinker could do that.\" \" Why, no ; I doubt if most of them can read at all.\" \" Now, I would give my little finger to know who that person is. \" \" Did you see his face?\" \"No; he never turned this way; the boy did when they were some distance off. It's very strange.\" \" What was he reading?\" \"I don't know; it was very beautiful. I wonder if he will ever come this way again I if he does \" \"Well, Melissa, and if he does?\" \"My scissors want grinding very badly ; they won't cut a bit.\" \"Why, Melissa, you don't mean to fall in love with a tinker?\" said Araminta, laughing. \" He is no tinker, I'm sure ; but why is he disguised? I should like to know.\" \"Well, but I came out to tell you that your father v ants you. Come along.\" The two young ladies then returned to the house, but the mystery of the morning was broached more than once, and can- i in every possible way. Spikeman, as soon as he had returned to the cottage, took out his writing mal to concoct an epistle. After some time in correcting, he made out a fair copy, which he read to !\u25a0 \" ' I tremble lest at the first moment you cast your eyes over the page, you throw it away without deigning to peruse it yet there is nothing in it which could raise a on the cheek of a modest maiden. If it be a crime to have seen you by chance, to have watched you by stealth, to consider hallowed every spot you visit \u2014 nay, more, if it be a crime to worship at the shrine of beauty and of innocence, or, to speak more boldly, to adore you \u2014 then am I guilty. You will ask, why I resort to a clandestine step. Simply, because, when 1 discovered your name and birth, I felt assured that an ancient feud between the two families, to which nor you nor I were parties, would bar an introduction to your father's bouse. You would ask me wiio I am. A gentleman, I trust, by birth aud education ; a poor one, I grant ; and you have made me poorer, for you have n me of more than wealth \u2014 my peace of mind and my happiness. I feel that I am presumptuous and bold ; but forgive me. Your eyes tell me you are too kind, too good, to give unnecessary pain ; and if you knew hew much I have already suffered, you would not oppress further a man who was happy until he saw you. Pardon me, therefore, my boldness, and excuse the means I have taken of placing this com muuiration before you.' \"That will do, I think,\" said Spikeman ; \" and now, Joey, we will go out and take a walk, and I will give you your direct .... CHAPTER XXXI. IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS. The next day our hero, having received the letter with his instructions, went with the wheel down to the copse near to the mansion-house. Here he remained quietly until he heard Miss Melissa coming down the gravel-walk ; he waited till she had time to gain her seat, and then, leaving his wheel outside, he walked round the cop.-e until he came to her. She raised her eyes from her book when she saw him. \"If you please, Miss, have you any scissors or knives for me to grind Joey, bowing with his hat in his hand. Miss Mathews looked earnestly at Joey. ' ' Who are you ? '' said she at last ; ' ' are you the boy who was on this road knife - grinder and his wheel yesterday afternoon? \" \"Yes. Madame, we came this way,\" replied Joey, bowing again very politely. \" Is he your father?\" \" No, Madame, he is my uncle ; he is not married.\" \"Your uncle. Well, I have a pair of scissors to grind, and I will go for them ;"], [99, "THE POACHER. 83 you may bring your wheel in here, as I '\\ you grind.\" \"Certainly, Miss, with the greatest pleasure.\" Joey brought in his wheel and observ- ><hews had left her book on the seat, it at the marked page and slipped the letter in ; and s; a had done so, when he perceived Miss Mathews and her cousin coming towards him. \" Here a sors ; mind you make them cut well.\" \" I will do my best, Miss,\" replied Joey, who in. mediately set to work. \"Have you been long at this trade?\" hews. \" No, Miss, not very long.\" \"And your uncle, has he been long at it?\" Joey hesitated on purpose. \"Why, I really don't know exai tly how long.\" y is your uncle not with you?\" \" He was obliged to go vfiss \u2014 that is, to a town at some distance from here \u2014 on business.\" \"Why, what business can a tinker have?1' inquired Araminl \" I suppose he wanted some soft solder, . \u25a0i write and read, boy?\" in quired Melissa. \" Me, Miss ! how should I know how to write and read?\" replied Joey, looking up. \" Have you been much about here ?\" \"Yes, Miss, a good deal ; uncle seems to like this part ; we never were so long before. The scissors are done now, Miss, and they will cut very well. Uncle . hopes of getting some work at the mansion house when he came bac!:. \" \" Can your uncle write and read ? \" ve he can a little, Miss.\" \" Whit do I owe you for the scissors?\" \"Nothing, Miss, if you please! I had rather not take anything from you.\" 1 why not from me ? \" se I never worked for so pre ty before- Wish you good mo ladies,\" said Joey, taking up his wheel and rolling it away. \"Well, Araminta, what do you think HOW? That's no knife-grinder's boy; he is as well-bred and polite as any lad I ever \" I suspect that he is a little story-teller, saying that he could not write and read,\" Araminta replied. \"And so do I ; what made him in a hurry to go away? \" \"I suppose he did not like our questions. der whether the uncle will come. Weh, Melissa, I must not quit your father just now, so I must leave you with your book ; \" and, so saying, Araminta took her way to the house. Miss Mathews was in a reverie for some minutes ; Joey's behaviour had puzzled her almost as much as what she had over heard the day before. At last she opened the book, and, to her geat astonishment, beheld the letter. She started\u2014 looked at it \u2014 it was addressed to her. She demurred at fh .he should open it. It must have been put there by the tinker's boy \u2014 it was evidently no tinker's letter ; it must 1 er, and she ought not to read it. There was something, however, so very charming in the whole romance of the affair, if it should turn out, as she suspected, that the tinker should prove a gentleman who had fallen in love with her, and had assumed the disguise. Melissa wanted an excuse to herself for opening the letter. At last she said to herself, \"Who knows but what it may be a petition from some poor person or another who is in distress? I ought to read it at all events.\" Had it proved to be a petition, Miss Melissa would have been terribly disap pointed. \" It certainly is very respectful,\" thought Melissa, after she had read it, \"but I cannot reply to it; that would never do. There certainly is nothing I can take offence at. It must be the tinker himself, I am sure of that ; but still he does not say so- Well, I don't know, but I feel very anxious as to what this will come to. O, it can come to nothing, for I cannot love a man I have never seen, and I would not admit a stranger to an interview; that's quite decided. I must show the letter to Araminta. Shall I ? I don't know, she is so particular, so steady, and would be talking of propriety, and prudence ; it would vex her so, and put her quite in a fever, she would be so unhappy ; no, it would be cruel to say anything to her, she would fret so about it ; I won't tell her until I think it absolutely necessary. It is a very gentlemanlike hand, and elegant language too; but still I'm not going to carry on a secret correspondence with a tinker. It must be the tinker. What an odd thing altogether ! What can his name be? An old family quarrel, too. Why it's a Romeo and Juliet iffair, only Romeo's a tinker. Well, one mask is as good as another. He acknowledges him self poor, I like that of him, there's some thing so honest in it. Well, after all, it will be a little amusement to a poor girl like me, shut up from year's end to year's end, with opodeldocs always in my nose ; so I will see what the end of it may be,\""], [100, "84 THE POACHER. thought Melissa, rising from her seat to go into the house, and putting the letter into her pocket. Joey went back to Spikeman and re progress. \"That's all I wish, Joey,\" said Spike- \" now you must not go there to morrow ; we must let it work a little ; if she is at all interested in the letter, she will be impatient to know more.\" Spikeman was right. Melissa looked up and down the road very often during the next day, and was rather silent during the evening. The second day after, having received his instructions, s with his knife-grinders wheel, for the mansion-house. When he went round the copse where the bench was, he found Miss Mathews there. \"I beg your pardon, Miss, but do you think there is any work at the house?\" \" Come here, Sir,\" said Melissa, as suming a very dignified \"Yes, Miss,\" said Joey, walking slowly to her. \"Now, tell me the truth, and I will reward you with half-a-crown.\" Miss.\" \" Did you not put this letter in my book before yesterday? \" _er, Miss! what letter?\" \" Don't you deny it, for you kno i did ; and if you don't tell me the truth, my father is a magistrate, and I'll have you hed.\" \" I was told not to tell,\" replied Joey, pretending to be frightened. \"But you must tell; yes, and tell me immediately.\" \" I hope you are not angry, & \" No; not if you tell the truth.' \"I don't exactly know, Miss, but a gen tleman \" \"What gentleman ? \" \" A gentleman that came to uncle, Miss.\" \" A gentleman that came to your uncle ; well, go on.\" \"I suppose he wrote the lette. , but I'm not sure ; _?..

Spikeman and Joey wete not long before they made their appearance. Spikeman particularly clean and neat, although vard appear ance of a tinker ; his hands were, by con tinual washing in hot water, and he had paid every attention to his person, except in wearing his rough and sullied clothes. \" My boy tells me, Miss, that you wish to speak to me,\" sa_d Spikeman, assuming the air of a vulgar man.

Do not blame him for that \u2014 now that I have seen you, I cannot ; but, Miss, he told me more. He said that he felt that he was unworthy of you, and had not a competence to offer you, even if he could obtain your favour ; that he discovered that there was a cause which prevented his gaining an introductoin to your family ; in fact, that he was hopeless \u25a0.pairing. He had hovered near you for a long time, for he could not leave the air you breathed ; and, at last, that he had resolved to set his lif-r upon the die and stake the hazard. Could I refuse him, Miss? He is of an old family, but not wealthy ; he is a gentleman by birth and education, and therefore I did not think I was doing so very wrong in giving him the chance, trifling as it might be. I beg your pardon, Madam, if I have offended ; and any message you may have to deliver to him, harsh as it may be \u2014 nay, even if it should be his death\u2014 it shall be faithfully and truly deb. \" When shall you see him, Master Tinker?\" said Melissa, very gravely. \" In a week he will be here, he said, not before.\" \"Considering he is so much in love, he takes his time,\" replied Melissa. \"Well, Master Tinker, you may tell him from me that I've no answer to give him. It is idiculous, as well as highly improper, that I should receive a letter or answer one from a person whom I never sav/. I admit his letter to be respectful, or I should have sent a much harsher message.\" ' ' Your commands shall be obeyed, Miss ; that is, if you cannot be persuaded to see him for one minute.\" 1 ' Most certainly not ; I see no gentle man who is not received at my father's house, and properly presented to me. It may be the custom among people in your station of life, Master Tinker, but not in mine ; and, as for yourself, I recommend you not to attempt to bring another letter.\" \"I must request your pardon for my fault, Miss ; may I ask, after I have seen the poor young gentleman, am I to report to you what takes place?\" \"Yes, if it is to assure me that I shall be no more troubled with his addresses.\" \"You shall be obeyed, Miss,\" continued Spikeman ; then, changing his tone and air, he said, \"I beg your pardon, have you any knives or scissors to grind ? \" \" No,\" replied Melissa, jumping up from her seat, and walking towards the house to conceal her mirth. Shortly afterwards she turned round to look if Spikeman was gone ; he had remained near the seat with his eyes following her footsteps. \" I could love that man,\" thought Melissa, as she walked on. \"What an eye he has, and what eloquence ! I shall run away with a tinker, I do believe; but it is my destiny Why does he say a week, a whole weeifc? But how easy to see through his disguise ! He had the stamp of a gentleman upon him. Dear me, I wonder how this is to end ! 1 must not tell Araminta yet ; she would be fidgeted out of her wits. How foolish of me ! I quite forgot to ask the name of this gentleman. I'll not forget it next time.\""], [102, "86 THE POACHER. CHAPTER XXXIII. WELL DONE, TINKER. \"It is beyond my hopes, Joey,\" said Spikeman, as they went back to the cottage, \"she knows well enough that I was plead ing for myself and not for another, and she has said quite as much as my sanguine wishes could desire; in fact, she has given me permission to come again, and report the result of her message to the non-existent gentleman, which is equal to an assignation. 1 have no doubt now I shall ultimately succeed, and 1 must make my preparations ; I told her that I should not be able to deliver her message for a week, and she did not like the delay, that was clear ; it will all work in my favour ; a week's expectation will ripen th< more than daily meetings. I must leave this to-night ; but you may as well stay here, for you can be of no use to me.\" ' ' Where are you going then ? \" \" First to Dudstone, to take my money out of the bank; I have a good sum, sufficient to carry me on for many months after our marriage, if I do marry her. I shall change my dress at Dudstone, of course, and then start for London by mail, and fit myself out with a most fashionable wardrobe, and et-ceteras, come down again to Cobhurst, the town we were in the other day,- with my portmanteau, and from thence return here in my tinker's clothes to resume operations. You must not go near her during my absence.\" \" Certainly not ; shall I go out at all?\" \"No, not with the wheel; you might meet her on the road, and she would be putting questions to you.\" That evening Spikeman set off, and was absent for five days, when he again made his appearance early in the morning. Joey had remained almost altogether in-doors, and had taken that opportunity of writing to Mary. He wrote on the day after Spike man's departure, as it would give ample time for an answer before his return ; but Joey received no reply to his letter. \" I am all prepared now, my boy,\" said Spikeman, whose appearance was consider ably improved by the various little pel arrangements which he had gone thi during the time he was in London. \"1 h\u00a3ve my money in my pockets, my port manteau at Cobhurst, and now it depends upon the rapidity of iny success when the day is to come that I make the knife grinder's wheel over to you. I will go down now, but without you this time.\" Spikeman set off with his wheel, and soon arrived at the usual place of meeting ; Miss Mathews, from the window, had per ceived him coming down the road ; she waited a quarter of an hour before she made her appearance ; had not she had her eyes on the hands of the time-piece, and knew that it was only a quarter of an hour, she could have sworn that it had \u25a0wo hours at least. Poor girl ! she had during this week run over every cir cumstance connected with the meeting at least a thousand times ; every word that had been exchanged had been engraven on her memory, and, without her knowledge almost, her heart had imperceptibly re ceived the impression. She walked down reading her book very attentively until she arrived at the bench. \"Any knives or scissors to grind, Ma'am?\" asked Spikeman, respectfully coming forward. \" You here again, Master Tinker! Why, I had quite forgot all about you.\" (Heaven preserve us ! how innocent girls will sometimes tell fibs out of modesty.) \" It were well for others, Miss Mathews, if their memory were equally treacherous,\" rejoined Spikeman. \"And why so, pray?\" 1 ' I speak of the gentleman to whom you sent the message.\" ' ' .n.nd what was his reply to you ? \" \"He acknowledged, Miss Mat1 madness of his communication to you, of the impossibility of your giving him an answer, and of your admitting him to your presence. He admired the prudence of your conduct, but, unfortunately, his ad miration only increased his love. He re quested me to say that he will write no more.\" \"He has done wisely, arid I am satisfied.\" \" I would I could say as much for him, Miss Mathews ; for it is my opinion that his very existence is now so bound up with the possession of you, that if he does not succeed he cannot exist.\" \" That is not my fault,\" replied Melissa, with her eyes cast down. \"No, it is not. Still, Miss Mathews, when it is considered that this man had abjured, I may say had almost despised, women, it is no small triumph to you, or homage from him, that you have made him er of your sex.\" his just punishment for having - us,\" \" Peihapsso; yet if we were all pi for our misdeeds, as Shakspere says, who should escape whipping?\" where did you learn to quote Shakspere?\" \" Where I learnt much more.

What could I say, Miss Mathews \u2014 what could I reply to a person in his state of desperation ? To reason with him, to argue with him, had been use- ' could only soothe him by making such a promise, provided that I was per mitted to do it Tell me, Miss Mathews, have I your permission to make the attempt?\" \"First, Mr. Tinker, I should wich to know the name of this gentleman.\" \" I promised not to mention it, Miss Mathews, but I can evade the promise.

You observe, Master Tin ere is the danger of your pleading for yourself, and not for your client ; and there is also the danger of my being insensibly moved to listen to the addresses of a tinker. Now, only reflect upon the awful consequences,\" continued Melissa, smiling. \"I pledge you my honour, Miss Ma thews, that I will only plead for the person whose name you have read in the book, and that you shall never be humiliated, by the importunities of a mender of pots and pans.\" iu pledge the honour of a tinker ; what may that be worth ? \" \"A tinker that has the honour of con versing with Miss Mathews has an honour that cannot be too highly appreciated.

I must now wish you good morning.\" \" When may I have the honour of again presenting myself in behalf of the poor gentleman?\" \"I can really make no appointments with tinkers,\" replied M if you personate that young man, you must be content to wait for days or months to catch a glimpse of the hem of my garment . to bay the moon and bless the stars, and I do not know what else. It is, in shore, catch me when you can ; and now, farewell, good Master Tinker,\" replied Melissa, leaving her own book, and taking the one Spikeman had put into her hand, which she carried with her to the house. It was all up vith Miss Melissa Mathews, that was clear. We shall pass over a fortnight, during which Spikeman, at first every other day, and subsequently every day or evening, had a meeting with Melissa, in every one of which he pleaded his cause in the third person. Joey began to be very tired of this affair, as he remained idle during the whole time, when one morning Spikeman told him that he must go down to the meeting place without the wheel, and tell Miss Mathews his uncle, the tinker, was ill, and not able to come that evening. Joey received his instructions, and went down immediately. Miss Mathews was not to be seen, and Joey, to avoid observ ation, hid himself in the copse, awaiting her arrival. At last she came, accompanied by Araminta, her cousin. As soon as they had taken their seats on the bench, Araminta commenced : \" My dear Melissa, I could not speak to you in the house on account of your father, but Simpson has"], [104, "88 THE POACHER. told me this morning that she thought it her duty to state to me, that you have been seen, not only in the day-time, but late in the evening, walking and talking with a strange-looking man. I have thought it very odd that you should not have mentioned this mysterious person to me but I do think it most strange that you should have been so imprudent. tell me everything that has happened must really make it known to your father.\" \"And have me locked up for mi that's very kind of you, Araminta,\" replied Melissa. \" But consider what you have been Melissa. Who is this man?\" \"A travelling tinker, who brough' letter from a gentleman who has been so silly as to fall in love with me.\" ' ' And what steps have you taken, cousin?\" \" Positively refused to receive a letter, or to see the gentle: \" Then why does the man come again?\" \"To know if we have any knives or _ to grind.\" ome: come, Melissa, this is ridiculous. AU the servants are talking about it ; and you know how servants talk. Why do you continue to see this fellow?\" \"Because he amuses me, and i. of him.\" \"If that is your only reason, you can have no objection to see him no more, now that scandal is abroad. Will you be me that you will not? Recollect, dear Melissa, how imprudent and how unmaidenly it is.\" \" Why, you don't think that I am going to elope with a tinker, do you, cousin?\" \"I should think not; nevertheless, a tinker is no companion for Miss Mathews, dear cousin. Melissa, you have been most imprudent. How far you have told me the truth I know not ; but this I must tell you, if you do not promise me to give up this disgraceful acquaintance, I will im mediatelv acquaint my uncle.\" \" I will not be forced into any promise, Araminta,\" replied Melissa, in \"Well, then, I will not hurry you into it. I will give you soi irs to reply, and if by that lime your own sense does not point out your indiscretion, 1 certainly will make it known to your father ; that is decided.\" So s Araminta rose from the bench and towards the house. \"Eight-and-forty hours,\" said Melissa, it fully , \" it must be decided by that time.\" Joey, who had wit e; ceive how matters stood, made up his mind not to deliver his message. He knew that Spikeman was well, and presumed that his staying away was to make Miss Mathews more impatient to see him. Melissa re mained on the bench in deep thought ; at last Joey went up to her. \"You here, my boy! what have you come for?\" said Melissa. \" I was strolling this way, Madam.\" \" Come here ; I want you to tell me the truth; indeed, it is useless to atten e me. Is that person your un. \" No, Miss, he is not.\" \"I knew that. Is he not the person who wrote the letter, and a gentleman in disguise? Answer me that question, and then I have a message to him which will make him happy. \" \" Pie is a gentleman, Miss.\" \"And his name is Spikeman; is it not?\" \" Yes, \" Will he be here this evening ? This is no time for trifling.\" \" If you want him, Miss, I am sure he wilL\" \"Tell him to be sure and come, and not in disguise, \"said Melissa, bursting into tears. \" That's no use, my die is cast,\" continued she, talking to herself. Joey remained by her side until she removed her hands from her face. ' ' Why do you wait ? \" \" At what hour, Miss, shall he come?\" said Joey. \" As soon as it is dusk. Leave me, boy, and do not forget.\" Joey hastened to Spikeman, and narrated what he had seen and heard, with the message of Melissa. ' ' My dear boy ! you have helped me to happiness,\" said Spikeman. \"She shed tears, did she? Poor thing ! I trust they will be the last she shall shed. I must be off to Cobhurst at once. Meet me at dark at the copse, for I shall want to speak to you.\" Spikeman set off for the town as fast as he could, with his bundle on his head. When half-way he went into a field and changed his clothes, discarding his tinker's rowing it into a ditch for enefit of the finder. He then went into the town to his rooms, dressed himself in a fashionable suit, arranged his port manteau, and ordered a chaise to be at the door at a certain time, so as to arrive at the village before dusk. After he had passed through the village he ordered the postboy to stop about fifty ya I the other side of the copse, and, getting out, desired him to rem;. irned. ras already there, and soon afterwards M. made her appearance, coming down the walk in a hurried manner, in her shawl and bonnet.

Joey put his"], [106, "THE POACHER. 90 money away, and then went lobed, and slept as serenely as the largest landed proprietor in the kingdom. When he awoke next morning, our hero began to reflect upon what he should do. He was not of Spike man's opinion that a travelling tinker was the next thing to a gentleman, nor did he much like the idea of rolling the wheel about all his life ; nevertheless, he agreed with Spikeman that it was a trade by which he could earn his livelihood, and if he could do no better, it would always be a resource. As soon as he had taken his breakfast, he sat down and wrote to Mary, acquainting her with alt that had taken place, and stating what his own feelings were upon his future prospects. Having finished his letter, he dressed himself neatly, and went out to call upon the widow James. Miss Ophelia and Miss Amelia were both at home. \"Well, Master Atherton, how do you do? and pray where is Mr. Spikeman?\" said both the girls in a breath. \"He is a long way from this ! \" replied Joey. \"A long way from this ! Why, has he not come back with you? \" \"No; and I believe he will not come back any more. I am come, as his agent, to take possession of his property.\" \"Why, what has happened?\" \" A very sad accider. t , \" replied our hero, shaking his head ; \" he fell \" \" Fell ! \" exclaimed the two girls in a breath. \" Yes, fell in love, and is married.\" \\ ell now 1 \" exclaimed Miss Ophelia, \"only to think ! \" Miss Amelia said nothing. ' ' And so he is really married ? \" \" Yes ; and he has given up business.\" \" He did seem in a great hurry when he last came here,\" observed Amelia. \"And what are you going to do ? \" \u25a0 ' I am not going to follow his example just yet,\" replied Joey. ' ' I suppose not ; but what are you going to do?\" replied Ophelia. ' ' I shall wait here for his orders ; I expect to hear from him. Whether I am to remain in this part of the country, or sell off and join him, or look out for some other business, I hardly know : 1 think i I shall look out for something else ; I don't like the cutlery line and tra- 1 for orders. How is your mamma, Miss Ophelia?\" \"She is very well, and has gone to iid expect to hear of Mr. Spikeman being married I Who is he married to, Joseph ? \" \"To a very beautiful young lady, daughter os Squire Mathews, with a large fortune.\" ' ' Yes, men always look for money now a-days,\" said Amelia. \"I must go now,\" said Joey, getting up ; \"I have some calls and some inquiries to make. Good morning, young ladies.\" It must be acknowledged that the two Misses James were not quite so cordial towards Joey as they were formerly ; but unmarried girls do not like to hear of their old acquaintances marrying anybody save themselves. There is not only a flirt ihe less, but a chance the less in consequence ; and it should be remarked, that there were very few beaux at Dudstone. Our hero was some days at Dudstone before he re ceived a letter from Spikeman, who in formed him that he had arrived safely at Gretna (indeed, there was no male relation of the family to pursue him), and the silken bands of Hymen had been made more secure by the iron rivets of the blacksmith ; 1 1 ree days after he had written a letter to his wife's father, informing him that he had done him the honour of marrying his daughter ; that he could not exactly say when he could find time to come to the mansion and pay him a visit, but that he would as soon as be conveniently could ; that he begged that the room prepared for them upon their arrival might have a large dressing-room attached to it, as he could not dispense with that convenience; that he was not aware whether Mr. Mathews was inclined to part with the mansion and property, but, as his wife had declared that she would prefer living there to any where else, he had net any objection to purchase it of Mr. Mathews, if they could come to terms ; hoped his gout was better, and was his \"very faithfully, Augustus Spikeman.\" Melissa wrote a few lines to Araminta, begging her, as a favour, not to attempt to palliate her conduct, but to rail against her incessantly, as it would be the surest method of bringing affairs to an amicable settlement To her father she wrote only these few words ; \u2014 \"My dear Papa, \u2014 You will be glad to hear that I am married. Augustus says that, if I behave well, he nd see you soon. Dear papa, your dutiful child, \"Melissa Spikeman.\" That the letters ,.f Spikeman and Melissa put the old gentleman in no small degree of rage, ma; lived; but nothing could be more judicious than the plan Spikeman had acted upor. It is use: plead to a man who is irritated with con-"], [107, "THE POACHER. 91 Stant gout ; he only becomes more despotic and more unyielding. Had Araminta at tempted to soften his indignation, it would have been equally fruitless ; but the com pliance with the request of her cousin, of continually railing against her, had the effect intended. The vituperation of Ara minta left him nothin;-; to say ; there was no opposition to direct his anathemas against ; there was no coaxing or wheed ling on the part of the offenders for him to repulse ; and when Araminta pressed the old gentleman to vow that Melissa should never enter the doors again, he accused her of being influenced hy interested motives, threw a basin at her head, and wrote an epistle requesting Melissa to come and take his blessing. Araminta refused to attend her uncle after this insult, and the old gentleman became still more anxious for .he return of his daughter, as he was now left entirely to the caprice of his servants. Araminta gave Melissa an account of what had passed and entreated her to come at once. She did so, and a general recon ciliation took place. Mr. Mathews, find ing his new son-in-law very indifferent to pecuniar}7 matters, insisted upon making over to his wife an estate in Herefordshire, which, with Melissa's own fortune, ren dered them in most affluent circumse Spikeman requested Joey to write to him now and then, and that, if he required as sistance, he would apply for it ; but still advised him to follow up the profession of \"Tig tinker as being the most inde pendent. Our hero had hardly time to digest the contents of Spaceman's letter when he received a large packet from Mary, ac- ng for her not having replied to him before, in consequence of her absence from the Hall. She had three weeks before received a letter written for Mrs. Chopper, acquainting her that Mrs. Chopper was so very ill that it was not thought possible that she could recover, having an abscess in the liver which threatened to break in ternally, and requesting Mary to obtain leave to come to Gravesend, if she possibly could, as Mi wished to see her before she died. Great as was Mary's repugnance to revisit Gravesend, she felt that the obligations she was under to Mrs. Chopper were too great for her to hesitate ; and showing the letter to Mrs. Austin, and stating at the same time that she considered Chopper as more than a mother to lie obtained the leave which she re quested, and set off for Gravesend. is with feelings of deep shame and humiliation that poor Mary walked down lain street of the town, casting her eyes up fearfully to the scenes of her former life. She was very plainly attired, and had a thick veil over her face, so that nobody recognized her ; she arrived at the door of Mrs. Chopper's abode, ascended the stairs, and was once more in the room out of which she had quitted Gravesend to lead a new life ; and most conscientiously had she fulfilled her resolution, as the must be aware of. Mrs. Chopper was in bed and slumbering when softly opened the door ; the signs of ap proaching death were on her countenance \u2014 her large round form had wasted away \u2014 her I now taper and blood less ; Mary would not have recognized her had she fallen in with her under other cir cumstances. An old woman was in attend ance she rose up when Mary entered, imagining that it was some kind lady come to visit the sick woman. Mary sat down by the side of the bed, and motioned to the old woman that she might go out, and then she raised her veil and waited till the sufferer roused. Mary had snuffed the candle twice that she might see sufficiently to read the Prayer Book which she had taken up, when Mrs. Chopper opened her eyes. \" How very kind of yo. , Ma'am ! \" said Mrs. Chopper ; \"and where is Miss ? My eyes are dimmer every day.\" \" It is me, Mary \u2014 Nancy, that was 1 \" \"And so it is ! O Nancy, now I shall die in peace ! I thought at first it was the kind lady who comes every day to read and to pray with me. Dear Nancy, how glad I am to see you ! And how do you do ? And how is poor Peter ? \" ' ' Quite well when I heard from him last, my dear Mrs. Chopper.\" 1 ' You don't know, Nancy, what a com fort it is to me to see you looking as you do, so good and so innocent ; and when I think it was by my humble means that you were put in the way of becoming so, I feel as if I had done one good act, and that perhaps my sins may be forgiven me.\" \" God will reward you, Mrs. Chopper ; I said so at the time, and I feel it now,\" replied Mary, the tears rolling down her cheeks ; \" I trust by your means, and with strength from above, I shall continue in the same path, so that one sinner may be saved.\" \" Bless you, Nancy ! \u2014 You never were a bad girl in heart : I always said so. And where is Peter now?\" ' ' Going about the country earning his bread; poor, but happy.\" \"Well, Nancy, it will soon be over with me ; I may die in a second, they tell me, or I may live for three or four days ; but I"], [108, "THE POACHER. \u2022-\u25a0-' sent for you that I might put my house in order. There are only two people that I care for upon earth \u2014 that is you and my poor Peter ; and all I have I mean to leave between you. I bave signed a paper al ready, in case you could not come, but now that you are come I will tell you all I but give me some of that drink first.\" Mary having read the directions on the label, poured out a wine-glass of the mix ture, and gave it to Mrs. Chopper, who swallowed it, and then proceeded, taking a paper from under her pillow \u2014 \\ncy ! this is the paper I told you of. I have about ,\u00a3700 in the bank, which is all that I have saved in twenty-two year it has been honestly made. I have, perhaps, much more owing to me, but I do nol it to be collected. Poor sailors have no money to spare, and I release them all. You will see me buried, Nancy, and tell poor Peter how I loved him, and I have left my account books, with my bad debts and good debts, to him. I am sure he would like to have them, for he knows the history of every sum-total, and he will look over them, and think of me. You a this furniture; but the wherry you must give to William ; he is not very honest, but he has a large family to keep. Do what you hke, dearest, about what is here ; perhaps my clothes would be useful wife ; they are not fit for you. Th good deal of money in theupper di it will pay for my funeral and the doctor. ve that is all now ; but do tell poor Peter how I loved him.

I have so longed to have you by my bed-side to read to me, and pray for me ! 1 want to hear you pray before 1 die. It will make me happy to hear you pray, and see that kind face looking up to heaven, as it was always meant to do.\" Poor Mary burst into tears. After a few minutes she became more compose*1 dropping down on her knees by tin of the bed, she opened the Prayer Book, and complied with the request of Chopper ; and as she fervently poured forth her supplication, occasiona' voice faltered, and she would st< brush away the tears which dimmed her sight. She was still so occupied when the door of the room was gently opened, and a lady, with listeen years old, quietly entered the room. did nt- tera until thi knelt down. She finished the prayer, rose, and, with a short curtsey, retired from the side of the bed. Although not recognized hersell lady, Mary immediately remembered Mrs. Phillips and her daughter Emma, having, as we have before observed, been at one time in Mrs. Phillips's service. \"This is the young woman whom you ished to see, Mrs. Chopper, is it not?\" said Mrs. Phillips. \"I am not surprised at your longing for her, for she appears well suited for a companion in such an hour , and. alas ! how few there are ! Sit down, I request,\" continued Mrs. Phillips, turning to Mary. \"How do you find to-day, Mrs. Chopper?\" \" Sinking fast, dear Madam, but not un willing to go, since I ha\\e seen Nancy, and heard of my poor Peter; he wrote to Nancy a short time ago. Nancy, don't forget my love to Peter.\" Emma Phillips, who had now grown tall and thin, immediately went up to Mary, and said. \"Peter was the little boy who rs.

It was her duty to return as soon as possible to her indulgent mistress, and the next morning she was busy in making the necessary arrangements. On the third T try attended friend, the bills wen all paid, and having - les which she wished to retain a e resolved to make over to William, the waterman, not he wherry, but all hand, furniture, an of Mrs. Chopper. This would enable him and his wife to set up in business thei d provide for their family, Mary knew that she had no right to do so wit' consent, but of this she felt she was sure ; having so done, she had nothing more to do but to see the lawyer who had drawn up the will, and having gone through the necessary forms, she received an order on the bank nearest to the Hall for the m which, with what was left in the drawers, after paying every demand, amounted to more than \u00a3700. She thought it was her duty to call upon Mrs. Phillips, before she went away, out of gratis. - kind ness to Mrs. Chopper; and as she had not been recognized, she had no scruple in ing. She was kindly received, and blushed at the praise bestowed upoi As she was going away Emma Phillips followed her out, and putting into her hand a silver pencil-case, requested she would \" give it to Peter as a remembrance of his little friend, Emma.\" The next day Mary arrived at the Hall, first communi- o Mrs. Austin what had occurred, and then, having received our here' last epistles, sat down to write the packet containing all the intelligence we have made known, and ended by requesting _]<\u25a0\u25a0 set off with his knife-g; come to the village near to the Hall, that he might receive his share of Mrs. Chop per's money, the silver pencil-case, and the warm greeting of his ado Joey lot long in deciding. He resolved \u25a0 would go to Mary ; and, having locked up his apartments, he once more . was soon on his way to Hampshire. CHAPTER XXXV. A RETROSPECT, THAT THE PARTIES MAY ALL START FAIR AGAIN. We must now leave our hero on his way to the Hall, while we acquaint our readers with the movements of other parties con- nected with our history. A correspondence had been kept up between O'Donahue and had succeeded in obtaining the pardon of the Emperor, and employ e Russian army, in which he had rapidly risen to th. rank of general. Five or six years had elapsed since he had married, and both O'Donahue and his wife nxious to visit England ; a letter at last came, announcing that he had obtained 3s absence from the Emperor, and in all probability, arrive in the ensuing spring. During this period M'Shane had con- tinued at his old quarters, Mrs. M'Shane still carrying on the business, which every year became more lucrative ; so much so, indeed, that her husband had for some time thought very seriously of retiring altogether, as they had already amassed a large sum, when M'Shane received the letter from O'Donahue, announcing that in a few mon ths he would arrive in England. Major M'Shane, who was very far from being satisfied with his negative position ety, pressed the matter moreeamestly to his wife, who, although she was perfectly content with hei I pn, did not oppose his entreaties. M'Shane found that after disposing of the good-will of the 5S, and the house, they would have a clear 000, which he considered more than enough for their wants, unencumbered as they were with children. Let it not be supposed that M'Shane had ceased in his inquiries after our hero ; on the contrary, he had resorted to all that his invention could suggest to trace him out, but, as the reader must be aware, without success. Both M'Shane and his wife mourned his loss, as if they had been bereaved of their own child ; they still indulged the idea that some day he would re-appear, but when, they could not sur mise. M'Shane had not only searched hero, but had traced his father with as little success, and he had now made up his mind that he should see no more of Joey, if he ever did see him until after the death of his father, when there would no longer be any occasion for secrecy. Our hero and his fate were a continual source of conversation between M'Shane and his wife; but latterly, after not having heard of him for more than five"], [110, "THE POACHER. 94 years the subject had not been so often renewed. As soon as M 'Shane had w ound up his affairs, and taken his leave of the eating-house, he looked out for an estate in the country, resolving to lay out two thirds of his money in land, and leave the remainder in the funds. After about three months' search, he found a property which suited him, and, as it so happened, about six miles from the domains held b Austin. He had taken possession and fur nished it. Asa retired officer in the army he was well received; and if Mrs. M'Shane metimes laughed at for her house keeper-like appearance, still her sweetness of temper and unassuming behaviour soon won her friends, and M'Shane found him self in a very short time comfortable and happy. The O'Donahues were expected to arrive very shortly, and M'Shane had now a domicile fit for the reception of his old friend, who had promised to pay him a visit as soon as he arrived. Of the Austins little more can be said that has not been said already. Austin was a miserable, unhappy man ; his cup of bliss \u2014 for he had every means of procuring all that this world considers as bliss, being in possession of station, wealth, and respect \u2014 was poisoned by the one heavy crime which passion had urged him to commit, and which was now a source of hourly and unavailing repentance. His son, who should have inherited his wealth, was lost to him, and he dared not mention that he was in existence. Everyday Aust1. came more nervous and irritable, more ex clusive and averse to society ; he trembled at shadows, and his strong constitution was rapidly giving way to the heavyweight on his conscience. He could not sleep without opiates, and he dreaded to sleep lest he should reveal everything of the past in his slumbers. Each year added to the irascibility of his temper, and the harshness with which he treated his servants and his unhappy wife. His chief amusement was hunting, and he rode in so reckless a man ner that people often thought that he was anxious to break his neck. Perhaps he was. Mrs. Austin was much to be pitied ; she knew how much her husband suffered ; how the worm gnawed within ; and, h that knowledge, she submitted to all his harshness, pitying him instead of condemn ing him ; but her life was still more em bittered by the loss of her child, and many were the bitter tears which she would shed when alone, for she dared not in her husband's presence, as he would taken them as a reproof to himself. Her led after our hero, and that one feeling rendered her indifferent, not only to all the worldly advantages by which she was surrounded, but to the un kindness and hard-heartedness of her hus band. Mary, who had entered her service as kitchen-maid, was very soon a favourite, and had been advanced to the situation of Mrs. Austin's own attendant. Mrs. Austin considered her a treasure, and she daily became more partial to and more confidential with her. Such was the state of affairs, when one morning, as Austin was riding to cover, a gentleman of the neigh- ood said to him in the course of con versation \u2014 \"By the bye, Austin, have you heard that you have a new neighbour ? \" \" What ! on the Frampton estate, I sup pose ? I heard that it had been sold.\" \" Yes ; I have seen him. He is one of your profession \u2014 a lively, amusing sort of Irish major ; gentlemanlike, nevertheless. The wife not very high-bred, but very fat, and very good-humoured, and amusing from her downright simpleness of heart. You will call upon them, I presume ? \" \"O, of course,\" replied Austin. \"What is his name, did you say ? \" \"Major M'Shane, formerly of the 53rd regiment, I believe.\" Had a bullet passed through the heart of Austin he could not have received a more sudden shock, and the start which lie made from his saddle attracted the notice of his companion. \"What's the matter, Austin, you look pale, you are not well ? \" \"No,\" replied Austin, recollecting him self, \"I am not; one of those twinges from an old wound in the breast came on. I shall be better directly.\" Austin stopped his horse, and put his hand to his heart. His companion rode up and remained near him. \"It is worse than usual; I thought it was coming on last night ; I fear that I must go home.\" \"Shall I go with you?\" \" O no ; I must not spoil your sport. I am better now a great deal ; it is going off fast. Come, let us proceed, or we shall be too late at cover.\" Austin had resolved to conquer his feel ings. His friend had no suspicion, it is true ; but, when we are guilty, we imagine that everybody su-pecLs us. They rode unutes in silence. \"Well, I am glad that you did not go home,\" observed his friend ; \"for you will meet your new neighbour ; he has sub scribed to the pack, and they say he is well mounted ; we shall see how he* rides.\" Austin made no reply ; but, after riding on a few yards further, he pulled up, saying"], [111, "THE POACHER. 95 that the pain was coming on again, and that he could not proceed. His com expressed his sorrow at Austin's indisposi tion, and they separated. Austin immediately returned home, dis mounted his horse, and hastened to his private sitting-room. Mrs. Austin had seen him return and could not imagine tbe cause, went in to her husband. \"What is the matter, my dear?\" said Mrs. Austin. \"Matter ! \" replied Austin, bitterly, pacing up and down the room ; \"heaven and hell conspire against us ! \" \"Dear Austin, don't talk in that way. What has happened?\" Tiething which will compel me, I expect, to remain a prisoner in va) house, or lead to something unpleasant. We must not stay here.\" Austin then threw himself down on a sofa, and was silent. At last the persua sions and endearments of his w ife overcame his humour. He told Shane was the major of his regiment when he was a private ; that he would inevitably recognize him ; and that, if nothing else occurred from M 'Shane's knowledge of his former name, at all events the general supposition of his having been an officer in the army would be contradicted, and it would lower him in the estimation of the county gentlemen. \"It is indeed a very annoying circum stance, my dear Austin ; but are you sure that he would, after so long a period, re cognize the private soldier in the gendeman of fortune?\" \"As sure as I sit here,\" replied Austin, gloomily ; \" I wish I were dead.\" \"Don't say so, dear Austin, it makes me miserable.\" \" I never am otherwise,\" replied Al clasping his hands. \"God forgive me ; I have sinned, but have I notbeen punished?\" \" You have, indeed ; and as repentance is availing, my dear husband, you will receive God's mercy.\" \"The greatest boon, the greatest mercy would be death,\" replied the unhappy man ; \"I envy the pedlar.\" Mrs. Austin wept. Her husband, irri tated at tears, which, to him, seemed to imply reproach, sternly ordered her to leave the room. That Austin repented bitterly of the crime which he had committed is not to be doubted : but it was not with the sub dued soul of a Christian. His pride was continually struggling within him, and was not yet conquered; this it was that made him alternately self-condemning and irascible, and it was the continual warfare in his soul which was undermining his constitution. Austin sent for medical advice for his supposed complaint. The country practi tioner, who could discover nothing, pro nounced it to be an affection of the heart. He was not far wrong ; and Mr. Austin's illness was generally promulgated. Cards and calls were the consequence, and Austin kept himself a close and patient prisoner in his own house. His hunters remained in the stables, his dogs in the kennel, and every one intimated that Mr. Austin was labouring under a disease from which he would not recover. At first this was ex- > irksome to Austin, and he was very impatient ; but gradually he became reconciled, and even preferred his sedentary and solitary existence. Books were his chief amusement, but nothing could min ister to a mind diseased, or drive out the rooted memory of the brain. Austin be came more morose and misanthropic every day, and at last would permit no one to come near him but his valet and his wife. Such was the position of his parents, when Joey was proceeding to their abode. CHAPTER XXXVI, OUR HERO FALL3 IN WITH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE, AND IS NOT VERY MUCH DELIGHTED. We left our hero rolling his knife-grinder's wheel towards his father's house. It must be confessed that he did it very unwillingly. He was never veiy fond of it at any time ; but, since he had taken possession of Spikeman's property, and had received from Mary the intelligence that he was worth ,\u00a3350 more, he had taken a positive aversion to it. It retarded his movements, and it was hard work when he had not to get his livelihood by it. More than once he thought of rolling it into a horsepond, and leaving it below low-water mark ; but then he thought it a sort of protection against inquiry, and against assault, for it told of poverty and honest employment; so Joey roll ith any feel ings of regard towards his companion. How many castles did our hero build as ent along the road ! The sum of money left to him appeared to be enormous. He planned and planned again ; and, like most people, at the close of the day, he was just as undetermined as at the com mencement. Nevertheless, he was very"], [112, "96 THE POACHER happy, as people always are, in anticipa tion ; unfortunately, more so than when they grasp what they have been seeking. Time rolled on, as well as the grindstone, and at last Joey found himself at the ale house where he and Mary had put up previously to her obtaining a situation at the Hall. He immediately wrote a letter to her, acquainting her with his arrival. He would have taken the letter hh only he recollected the treatment he had received, and found another messenger in the butcher's boy, who was going up to the Hall for orders. The answer returned by the same party was, that Mary would come down and see him that evening. When Mary came down Joey wa tonished at the improvement in her ap pearance. She looked much younger than she did when they had parted, and her dress was so very different, that our hero could with difficulty imagine that it was the same person who bad been his com panion from Gravesend. The careless air and manner had disappeared ; there was a retenue\u2014a. dignity about her which as tonished him ; and he felt a sort of re mingled with his regard, for her, of which he could not divest himself. But, if she looked younger (as may well be imagined) from her change of life, she also looked more sedate, except when she smiled, or when occasionally, but very rarely, her merry laughter reminded him of the care less, good-tempered Nancy of former times. That the greeting was warm need hardly be said. It was the greeting of a sister and younger brother who loved each other dearly. \" You are very much grown, Joey,\" said Mary. \" Dear boy, how happy I am to see you I \" \" And you, Mary, you're younger in the fare, but older in your manners. Are you as happy in your situation as you have told me in your letters?\" \" Quite happy ; more happy than ever I deserve to be, m\\ me, Joey, what do you think of doing? You have now the means of establishing yourself.\" \"Yes, I have been thinking of it ; but I don't know what to do.\" \"Well, you must look out, and do not JoeY> that if anytl 1 shall have my money as 1 own,\" \" Nay, Mary, why should I take that ?\" \"Because, as it is of no use to m 1 now, if you succeed, you will \u25a0 pay me in terest for it ; so I shall gain as . You must not refuse your sister, my dear boy.\" \"Dear Mary, how I wish we could live in the same house ! \" \"That cannot be now, joey; you are above my situation at the Hall, even ing that you would ever enter it.\" \"That I never will, if I can help it ; not that I feel angry now, but I like to be independent.\" \" Of course you do.\" 11 And as for that grindstone, I hate the sight of it ; it has made Spikeman's fortune, but it never shall make mine.\" \"You don't agree, then, with your former Companion,\" rejoined Mary, \"that a tinker's is the nearest profession to that of a gentleman which you know of.\" \" I certainly do not,\" replied our hero; \" and as soon as I can get rid of it I will ; I have rolled it here, but I will not roll it much farther. 1 only wish I knew to go.\" \" I have something in my pocket which puts me in mind of a piece of news which I received the other day, since my return. First, let me give you what I have in my pocket \" \u2014 and Mary pulled out the pencil-case sent to Joey by Emma PI \"There, you know already who that is from.\" Yes, and I shall value it very much, for she was a dear, kind little creature ; and when I was very, very miserable, she comforted n \"Well, Joey, Miss Phillips requested me to write when I came back, as she wished to hear that I had arr the Hall.

After which our hero took leave of Maty, promising to corre spond more freely than before ; and once more putting the strap of his knife-grinder's on his journey to Portsmouth. Joey had not gained I \u00bbm the : my grindstone?\" He did > leave it on the road ; he did not know to whom he i \u25a0 away. He rolled it ou for about six miles farther, and then, quite tired, he i to follow the plan formerly nan, and repose a littl turf on I is very i the otl li was shaded ; and die from it hung, he first made his dinner ol laying his head on the bundle, was soon in a sound sleep, from which hc was aw by hearing voices on the other side of the hedge. He turned round, and perceived two mi ide of the road, close to his knife-grinder's wheel. They were in hirts and trousers only, and sitting down on the turf. \"It. * a very good plan,\" ob- ! one of them; \"we should then travel without suspicion.\" ild get off with it with out b Where can the owner of it be?\" he is away upon some 1 another, and has left the wh \u25a0 \u25a0 back.

If we can only get it o it till night, But first . , ie fellow it belongs to may not it here.\" As the 1 this he rose up and the hedge, and our hero immediately perceived that it was his old acquaintance, Furness, the school master and marine. What to do lie hardly At last he perceived Furness ad vancing towards the gate of the field, which was close to where he was lying, and, as escape was impossible, our hero covered his face with his arms, and pre- ! to be fast asleep. He soon heard a \" Hush !\" given, as a signal to the other man, and, after a while, lose to him Joey pretended to snore loudly, and place. At last he heard Furness say \u2014 \"Do you watch by him while I wheel y the grindstone.\" \" But, if he wakes, what shall I do?\" \" Brain him with that big stone. If he does not wake up when 1 am past the I field follow me.\" That our hero had no inclination to ifter this notice may be easily ima- he heard tl med, and the \u25a0 y, much to his d as Furn :.j party who had it in charge; aud [oey continued to snore hard, until at last he heard the departing foot- 5's comrade, who had watched him. He thought it prudent to continue motionless for some time longer, to give them time to be well away from him, and then he gradually turned round and looked in the direction in which they had gone ; he could see nothing of them, and it was net until he had risen up, and climbed up on the gate, that he perceived them two or three fields off, running away at a rapid pace. Thanking heaven t had escaped the danger that he was in, and delighted with the loss of his property, our hoo* recommenced his journey with his bundle over his shoulder, and before tie was safe outside one of the stages, touk him to a town from which there was another which would carry him to Portsmouth, at which sea-port he arrived -ing without further adventure. As our hero sat on I of the coach and reflected upon his last adventure, the more he felt he had reason to congratulate himself. That Furness had deserted from the Marine Barracks at Portsmouth was evident ; and if he had not, that he v\u00bb have recognized j time or other was almost ci .\", he felt sure that he was safe at Portsmouth, as it would be the last place at which Furness would make his appearance ; and he also felt that his eel, in supplying Furness with the ostensible means of livelihood, and thereby preventing his being taken up as a deserter, had proved the best friend to him, and could not have been disposed of"], [114, "98 THE POACHER. better. Another piece of good fortune was his having secured his bundle and money ; for had he left it with the wheel, it would have, of course, sharedits fate. \" Besides,\" thought Joey, \" if I should chance to fall in with Furness again, and he attempts to approach me, I can threaten to have him taken as a deserter, and this may deter him from so doing.\" It was with a grateful heart that our hero laid his head upon his pillow, in the humble inn at which he had taken up his quarters. CHAPTER XXXVII. IN WHICH OUR HERO RETURNS TO HIS FORMER EMPLOYMENT, BUT ON A GRANDER SCALE OF OPERATION. Our hero had received from Mary the name and address of Mrs. Phillips's brother, and, on inquiry, found that he was known by everybody. Joey dressed himself in his best suit, and presented himself at the door about ten o'clock in the morning as Joseph O'Donahue, the name which he had taken when he went to Gravesend, and by which name he had been known to Mrs. Phillips and her daughter Emma, when he made occasional visits to their house. He was admitted, and found him self once more in company with his friend Emma, who was now fast growing up into womanhood. After the first congratu and inquiries, he stated his intentions in coming down to Portsmouth, and their as sistance was immediately promised. They then requested a detail of his adventures since he quitted Gravesend, of which Joey told everything that he safely could ; pass ing ovi ting with Furness by simply stating that while he was asleep his knife-grinder's wheel had been stolen by two men, and that when he awol dared not offer any opposition. Phillips and her daughter both knew that there was some mystery about oui which had induced him to come to and also to leave Gravesend; but, being a; by Mary and himself that he was not to blame, they did not press him to say more than he wished ; and, as soon as he finish' ducing him lo Mr. Small, the brother of Mrs. Phillips, in whose house they then i was then in his office. \" 1' i to wait till to-morrow, and in the mean time you will be able to tell my uncle all about Joey,\" observed Emma. ' ' I think it will be better, my dear.\" re plied Mrs. Phillips; \"but there is Mari anne's tap at the door, for the second time ; she wants me downstairs, so I must leave you for a little while ; but you need not go away, O'Donahue; I will be back soon.\" Mrs. Phillips left the room, and our hero found himself alone with Emma. \"You have grown very much, Joey,\" said Emma; \"and so have I too, they tell me.\" \"Yes, you have indeed,\" replied Joey; \"you are no longer the little girl who con. sorted me when I was so unhappy. Do you recollect that day?\" \"Yes, indeed I do, as if it were but yesterday. But you have never told me why you lead so wandering a life ; you won't trust me.\" \"I would trust you with anything but that which is not mine to trust, as I told you four years ago ; it is not my secret ; as soon as I can I will tell you everything : but I hope not to lead a wandering life any longer, for I have come down here to settle, it I \" What made you think of coming down here?\" asked Emma. \" Because you were here ; Mary told me so. I have not yet thanked you for your present, but 1 have not forgotte kindness in thinking of a poor boy like me, when he was far away; here it is,\" continued Joey, taking out the pencil case, \"and 1 have loved it dearly,\" added he, kissing it, \" ever since I have had it in my possession. I very often have taken it out and thought of you. \" ' ' Now you ai e so rich a man. you should give me som eep for your sake,\" replied Emma, \"and I will be ver ful of it, for old acquaintance e it can I offer to you? you are a young lady ; I would give you ail I had in the world, if i I \" i w you,\" rejoined Emma, \" you were dressed as a young gentleman.\" \"Yes, I was,\" replied Joey, with a and, a. ition of Emma n to his mind the kindness of the M 'Shanes, he passed his hand across his eyes to brush I two thai started. \"I did not nit, i iappy,\" r_ma, taking our hero's b \" I am sure you did not,\" replied Joey, smiling. \"Yes, I was then as you say; but recollect :) 1 have been a inder.\" I now, your friend said, that it was the nearest thing to a gentleman ; \u25a0<-pe you will be quite a gentle man again.\""], [115, "THE POACHER. 99 \" Not a gentleman, for I must turn to some business or another,\" replied Joey. not mean an idle gentleman ; I meant a respectable profession,\" said Emma. \" My uncle is a very odd man, but very good-hearted , you must not mind his way towards you. He is very fond of mamma and me, and I have no doubt will interest himself about you, and Lt your money is not thrown awav. Perhaps you would like to set up a bum boat on your own account?\" added Emma, laughing. Mo, I thank ycu; I had enough of that. Poor Mrs. Chopper I what a kind ire she was ! I'm sure I ought to be very grateful to her for thinking of me as she did.\" \" I believe,\" said Emma, \" that she was a very good woman, and so does mamma. Recollect, Joey, when you speak to my uncle, you must not contradict him.\" \" I am sure I shall not,\" replied Joey ; ' why should I contradict a person so far my superior in years and everything else ? \" tainly not ; and as he is fond of argument, you had better give up to him at once; and, indeed,\" continued Emma laughing, \" everybody else does in the end. I hope you will find a nice situation, and that we shall see a great deal of you.\" \" I am sure I do,\" replied Joey, \" for I have no friends that I may see, except you. How I wish that you did know every thing ! \" A silence ensued between the young people, which was not interrupted until by the appearance of Mrs. Phillips, who had seen Mr. Small, and had made an engage ment for our hero to present himself at nine o'clock on the following morning, after which communication our hero took his leave. He amused himself during the remainder of that day in walking over the town, which at that time presented a most bustling appearance, as an expedition was fitting out; the streets were crowded with officers of the army, navy, and marines, in their uniforms ; soldiers and sailors, more or less tipsy ; flaunting ribbons and gaudy colours, and every variety of noise was to be heard that could be well imagined, from the quacking of a duck, with its head out of the basket in which it was confined to be taken on board, to the martial music, the rolling of the drums, and the occasional salutes of artillery, to let the world know that some great man had put his foot on board of a ship, or had again deigned to tread upon terra firma. All was bustle and excitement, hurrying, jostling, cursing, and swearing ; and joey found himself, by the manner in which he was shoved about right and left, to be in the way of everybody. At the time appointed our hero made his appearance at the door, and, having given his name, was asked into the count ing-house of the establishment, where sat Mr. Small and his factotum, Mr. Sleek. It may be as well here to describe the persons and peculiarities of these two gentlemen. Mr. Small certainly did not accord with his name, for he was a man full six f^t high, and stout in proportion ; he was in face extremely plain, with a turned-up nose ; but, at the same time, there was a lurking good-humour in his countenance, and a twinkle in his eye, which immediately prepossessed you, and in a few minutes you forgot that he was not well-favoured. Mr. Small was very fond of an argument and a joke, and he had such a forcible way of maintaining his argument when he happened to be near you, that, as Emma had told our hero, few people after a time ventured to contradict him. This mode of argument was nothing more than dig ging the hard knuckles of his large hand into the ribs of his opponent \u2014 we should rather say gradually gimleting, as it were, a hole in your side, as he heated in his illustrations. He was the last person in the world in his disposition to inflict pain, even upon an insect \u2014 and yet, from this habit, no one perhaps gave more, or ap peared to do so with more malice, as his countenance was radiant with good humour, at the very time when his knuckles were taking away your breath. What made it worse, was, that he had a knack of seizing the coat lappet with the other hand, so that escape was difficult ; and when he had exhausted all his reasoning, he would follow it up with a pressure of his knuckles under the fifth rib, saying, \" Now you feel the force of my argument, don't you?\" Everybody did, and no one would oppose him unless the table was between them. It was much the same with his jokes ; he would utter them, and then, with a loud laugh, and the insidious insertion of his knuckles, say, \"Do you take that, eh?\" Mr. Sleek had also his peculiarity, and was not an agreeable person to argue with, for he had learnt to argue from his many years' constant com panionship with the head of the firm. Mr. Sleek was a spare man, deeply pock marked in the face, and with a very large mouth ; and, when speaking, he sputtered to such a degree, that a quarter of an hour's conversation with him was as good as a shower-bath. At long range Mr. Sleek could beat his superior out of the"], [116, "THE POACHER. 100 field ; but, if Mr. Small approached once to close quarters, Mr. Sleek gave in im mediately. The captains of the navy used sert that this fibbing enforcement of '//is, on the part of Small, sa- .ill the rules of modern warfare, and never would stand it, unless tl, quired an advance of money ; and then, by submitting to a certain quantity of digs in the ribs in proportion to the unreason ableness of their demand, they usually obtained their object ; as they said he \"knuckled down \" in the end. As for Mr. Sleek, although the best man in the \u25a0 he was their abhorrence ; he was nothing but a watering-pot, a re not plants which required his aid to add to their vigour, Mr. Sleek, even in the largest company, invariably found himself alone, and could never imagine why. Still he was an important personage; and when is to be got on board in a hurry, officers in his Majesty's service do not care about a little spray. Mr. Small was, as we have observed, a navy agent \u2014 that is to say, he was a general provider of the officers and capiains of his ry's service. He obtained their agency on any captures which they might send in, or he cashed their bills, advanced them money, supplied them with their wine, and every variety of s'oek might be required ; and in consequence was reported to be accumulating a fortune. As is usually the c 1 open house for the captains who were his clients, and occasionally invited the junior offio the hospitalities of his table, so that Mrs. Phillips and Emma were of great use to him, and had quite sufficient to do in superintending such an establishment. \u25a0. made our readers better ac quainted with our new characters, we proo:. ' ' Well, young man, I've heard all r leave off vagabondizing, do you?\" \"Yes, a Joey. \"How old ar r you? can you keep book - \" 1 am seventeen, and have kept books,\" replied out innocence; for he considered Mrs. Choppers day-books to \u2022 omination. \"And you have some money \u2014 how much ? \" Joey replied that he had so much of his own, and that his sister had so much more. i pounds; eh, youngster? ness with /\"ioo Ie I am. Money breeds money ; do you land that?\" and here loey received a knuckle in his ribs, which almost took his breath a\\^ay, but which he out flinching, as he presumed it was a mark of good-wilL \" What can we do with this lad, Sleek ? \" said Mr. Small; \"and what can we do with his men \"Let him stay in the counting-house here for a week,\" replied Mr. Sleek, \"and we shall see what he can do ; and, as for his money, it will be as safe here as in a country bank, until we know how to em ploy it, and we can allow 5 per cent, for it.\" All this was said in a shower of spray, which induced Joey to wipe his face with his pocket-handkerchief. \"Yes, I think that will do for the present,\" rejoined Mr. r but you observe, Sleek, that this young lad has very power ful interest, and we shall be expected to do something for him, or we shall ha worst of it. You understand that?\" con tinued he, giving Joey a knuckle again. \" The ladies I no standing against them \u2022 \" Joey thought that tr-ere was no standing such digs in the ribs, but he said nothing. \" I leave him to you, Sleek. I must be call upon Captain James. See to the lad's food and lodging. There's an order from the gun-room of the Hecate.\" So saying, Mr. Small departed. Mr. Sleek asked our hero where he was stopping r recommended him another lodg ing close to the house, with directions how to proceed, and what arrangements to make ; told him to haste as much as he could, and then come back to the counting house. In a couple of hours our hero was back again. ' ' Look on this list ; do you understand it?\" said Mr. Sleek to Joey; \" it is sea stock for the Hecate, which sails in a day or two. If I send a porter with you to the people we deal with, would you be able to get all these thing 1 with a cross? the wine and the oihers we have Joey looked over it, and was quite at home ; it was only bumboating on a large scale. \" O, yes; and I know the , of all these things,\" replied he ; \"I have been used to the supplying of ships at Gravesend.\" \" Why then,\" said Mr. Sleek, \" you are \u25a0i'i I want ; for I have no tune to attend to out-door work now . \" sent for, ar.d our hero soon execute not only with a precision, but with a rapidity, that was satisfactory to Mr. Sleek. As soon articles were all collected, Joea whether he should uke them on board \u2014"], [117, "THE POACHER. IOI nderstand the work, Mr. Sleek, and not even an egg shall be broke, I promise you.\" The second part of the commission was executed with the same precision by our hero, who returned with a receipt of every article having been o and in good condition ; Mr. Sleek was de lighted with our hero, and told Mr. Small so when they met in the evening. Mr. Sleeks opinion was given in the presence of Mrs. Phillips and Emma, who ex changed glances of satisfaction at Joey's nate debfit. CHAPTER XXXVJ1I. MICH THE WHEEL OI' PO] CE OR TWO IN FAVOUR OF OUR HERO. the feelings of our hero towards Emma Phillips, we should hardly be warranted in saying that he was in love with her, although at seventeen years young men are very apt to be, or so to fancy themselves. The difference in their positions was so great, that although our hero would, in his dreams, often fancy himself on most intimate terms with his , rr le patroness, in his waking thoughts she was more an object of adoration and ct -a being to whom he was most i !y and devotedly attached \u2014 one idship and kindness had so wrought upon his best feelings that he would have thought it no sacrifice 1 ; but the idea of ever being allied to her than he now was had entered into his imagination ; all thougl I er he united himself to any female for life, the party selected ,je like Emma Phillips ; or, if not, he would remain single. All his endeavours I o prove himself worthy of her patron age, and to be rewarded by her smiles of encouragei\" met. She was loadstar which guided him on to his . and, stimulated by h to find favour in her sight, Joey never re- in his exertions ; naturally active and metl\" the gieatest satisfaction to Mi found more than half the labour taken off his hands ; \". that if Joey once said a thing : hould be done, it was not only we'! done, but done to the very time .vas stipulated for its completion. cared not for meals, or anytl kind, and often went without his dinner. \"Sleek,\" said Small, one day, \"that poor boy will be starved.\" \" It's not my fault, Sir; he won't co to his dinner if there is anything to do I as there is always something to do, it is as as the day that he can get no dinner. I wish he was living in the house altogether, and came to his meals with us, after the work was done; it would be very advan tageous, and much time saved.\" \"Time is money, Sleek. Time saved is money saved ; and, therefore, he is worthy of his food. It shall be so. Do you see to it.\" Thus, in about two months after his arrival, Joey found himself installed in a nice little bed-room, and living at the table of his patron constantly in com pany with the naval officers, but, what was of more value to him, in the company of >ilips and Emma. We must pass over more than a year, during which time our hero had become a person of some importance. He was a great favourite with the naval captains, as lunctuality and ra] \u25a0 sponded with their ideas of doing business ; and it was constantly said to Mr. Sleek or to Mr. Small, \"Let O'Donahue and I settle the matter, and all will go right.\" Mr. Small Wished him at a salary of per annum, besides his living in the house, and our hero was comfortable and He was well known to all the officers, from his being constan board of their ships, and was a rite. Joey soon discovered that Emma had a fancy for natural curiosities ; and as he boarded almost every man-of-wai came into the port, he soon filled her room with a variety of shells and of birds, which he procured for her. These were presents h he could make and which she could accept, and not a week passed without our hero adding something to her museum of live and dead obj'. : I Emma was now grown up, and was paid such attention to by the officers who frequented her uncle's house (not only on account of her beauty, but on account of the expectation that her uncle. without children, would give her a handsome fortune), that some emotions of jealousy, of which h hardly conscious, would illy give severe pain to our hero. Perhaps, as his fortunes rose, so did his hopes ; certain it is, that sometimes he was very \u25a0:. Emma was too clear-sighted not. h \u25a0 -tened, by h 1 attentions, to remove the feeling ; not that she had any definite ideas upon the any more than Joey, but she could not bear to see him look unhappy."], [118, "THE POACHER. 102 Such was the state of things, when one day Mr. Small said to Joey, as he was busy copying an order into the books, \"O'Donahue, t have been laying out some of your money for you.\" \"Indeed, Sir! I'm very much obliged to you.\" ' ' Yes ; there was a large stock of claret sold at auction to-day; it was good, and .leap. I have purchased to the amount of j\u00a36oo on your account. You I ottle and bin it here, and sell it as you can. If you don't like the bargain I'll off your hands.\" \" I am very grateful to you, Sir,\" replied Joey, who knew the kindness of the act, which, in two months, more than doubled his capital ; and, as he was permitted to continue the business on his own account, he was very soon in a position amounting to independence, the French wine business being ever afterwards considered as ex clusively belonging to \"our hero. t One morning, as Joey happened to be in the counting-house by himself, which was rat her an unusual occurrence, a midshipman came in. Joey remembered him very well, as he had been often there before. \" Good morning, Mr. O'Donahue,\" said the mid shipman. \" Is Mr. Small within ? \" ' ' No, he is not ; can 1 do anything for you?\" ' * Yes, if you can tell me how I am to persuade Mr. Small to advance mea little upon my pay, you can do some thing for me.\" \" I never heard of such an application before,\" replied Joey, smiling. \" No, that I venture you did not, and it requires all the impudence of a midshipman to make such a one ; but the fact is, Mr. O'Donahue, I am a mate with a-ye ir, and upon that I have continued to assist my poor old mother up to the present. She now requires \u00a31.0 in consequence of illness, and I have not a farthing. I will repay it if I live, that is certain ; but I have little hopes of obtaining it, and nothing but my affection for the old lady would induce me to risk the mortification of a refusal. It's true enough that ' he who goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing.'\" \" I fear it is ; but I will so far assist you as to let you know what your only chance fate your case to Mr. Small as you d then stand to him while he answers ; if he puts his knuckles into your ribs to enforce his argu ments, don't shrink, and then wait the result without interrupting him.\" \"Well, I'd do more than that for the old lady,\" replied the poor midshipman, Small made his appearance. The midshipman told his story in very few words, and Mr. Small heard him with out interruption. When he had finished, Mr. Small commenced, \u2014 \"You see, my man, you ask me to do what no navy-agent ever did before\u2014 to lend upon a promise to pay, and that promise to pay from a midshipman. In the first place, I have only the promise without the security; that's one point, do you observe (a punch with the knuckles) ? And then the promise to pay depends whether you are in the country or not. Again, if you have the money, you may not have the inclination to pay ; that's another point {then came another sharp impression into the ribs of the middy). Then, again, it is not even personal secur ity, as you may be drowned, shot, blown up, or taken out of the world before any pay is due to you ; and by your death you would be unable to pay, if so inclined ; there's a third point (and w third dig, which the middy stood boldly up against). Insure your life you cannot, for you have no money ; you, therefore, require me to lend my money upon no security whatever ; for even allowing that you would pay if you could, yet your death might prevent it ; there's another point {and the knuckles again penetrated into the mid shipman's side, who felt the torture in creasing as hope was departing). But,\" continued Mr. Small, who was evidently much pleased with his own ratiocination, re is another point not yet touched upon, which is, that, as good Christians, we must so a money upon no security, or even give it away, for so are we commanded ; and, therefore, Mr. O' Donah ue, you w ill tell M r. Sleek to let him have the money; there's the last and best point of all, eh?\" wound up Mr. Small, with a thumping blow upon the ribs of the middy that almost took away his breath. We give this as a speci men of Mr. Small's style of practical and theoretical logic combined. \"The admiral, Sir, is coming down the street,\" said Sleek, entering, \"and I think he is coming here.\" Mr. Small, who did not venture to chop logic with admirals, but was excessively polite to such great people, went out to receive the admiral, hat in hand. said the admiral, \"the counting-house for business, if you please. I have very unexpected orders to leave Portsmouth. 1 must save the next if possible. The ships will be ready, for I know what our navy can do when required ; but, as you know, 1 have not one atom of stock on board.

Now, tell me \u2014 here is the list of what is required ; boats will be ready and men in plenty to on board ; \u2014 can you get it ready by that time?\" that time, Sir William!\" replied Small, looking over the tremendous cata \" It's now eleven o'clock; can it all te down by four o'clock \u2014 that is the lal can give you?\" \" Impossible, Sir William.\" \" It is of the greatest importance that we sail at five o'clock ; the fact is, I must and will ; but it's hard that I must starve for a whole cruise.\" \"Indeed, Sir William,\" said Mr. Small, \"if it were possible; but two cows, so many sheep, hay, and everything to be got from the country ; we never could manage row morning, perhaps.\" \"Well, Mr. Small, I have appointed no prize-agent yet ; had you obliged me \" Our hero now stepped forward and ran over the list, \"Can you inform me, Sir,\" said he to the flag captain, \"whether the Zenobia or Orestes sail with the squadron?\" \" No, they do not,\" was the reply. \" I beg your pardon, Mr. Small,\" said Joey, \"but I do think we can accomplish this with a little arrangement\" \" Indeed ! \" cried Sir William. \"Yes, Sir William ; if you would imme diately make the signals for two boats to \u2022 in shore, with steady crews to assist me, I promise it shall be done. \" 11 said, O'Donahue!' cried the captain ; \"we are all right now, admiral ; if he says it shall be done, it will be done.\" \" May I depend upon you, Mr. O'Dona hue ? \" \" Yes, Sir William ; everything shall be as you wish.\" \"Well, Mr. Small, if your young man keeps his word, you shall be my prize-agent. Good morning to you.\" \" How could you promise ? \" cried Small, addressing our hero, when the admiral and suite had left the counting-house. \" Because I can perform, Sir,\" replied Joey ; \" I have the cows ami sheep for the Zenobia and Orestes, as well as the fodder, all read)' in the town ; we can get others for them to-morrow , and I know v. I lay my hands on everything ( . ell that's lucky ! but there is no time to be lost.\" Our hero, with his usual promptitude and activity, kept his promise ; and, as Mr. Small said, !t was lucky, for the prize- agency, in a few months afterwards, proved worth to him nearly not to be supposed that Joey neg lected his correspondence either with Mary or Spikeman, although with the latter it was not so frequent. Mary wrote to him month ; she had not many subjects to enter upon, chiefly replying to Joey's comm end congratulating him upon his success. Indeed, now tbat our hero had been nearly four years with Mr. he might be said to be a very rising and independent person. Hiscapital. which jreased very considerably, had been thrown into the business, and he was now a junior partner, instead of a clerk, and had long enjoyed the full confidence both of his superior and of Mr. Sleek, who now entrusted him with almost everything. In short, Joey was in the fair way to com petence and distinction. CHAPTER XXXIX. A CHAPTER OF INFINITE VARIETY, CON- TAINING AGONY, LAW, LOVE, QUAK- RELLING. AND SUICIDE. It may be a subject of interest on the part of the reader to inquire what were the rela tive positions of Emma Phillips and our hero, now that four years had passed, during which time he had been continually in her company, and gradually, as he rose in importance, removing the distance that was between them. \"We have only to reply, that the consequences natural to such a case did ensue. Every year their intimacy increased \u2014 every year added to the hopes of our hero, who now no longer looked upon an alliance with E'.ima as impossible ; yet he still never felt sufficient confidence in himself or his fortunes to intimate such a thought to her ; indeed, from a long habit of veneration and respect, he was in the position of a subject before a queen who feels a partiality towards him ; he dared not give vent to his thoughts, and it remained for her to have the un feminine task of intimating to him that he might venture. But, although to outward appearance there was nothing but respect and feelings of gratituae on his part, and condescension and amiability on hers, there was a rapid adhesion going on within. Their interviews were more restrained, their words more selected ; for both parties felt how strong were the feelings which they would repress ; they were both pensive, silent, and distant \u2014 would talk uncon."], [120, "104 THE POACHER. nectedly, running from one subject to another, attempting to be lively and uncon cerned when they were most inclined to be otherwise, and not daring to scrutinize too minutely their own feelings when they found themselves alone ; but what they would fain conceal from themselves their very attempts to conceal made known to other people who were standing by. Both Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Small perceived how matters stood, and, had they had any objections, would have immediately no longer permitted them to be in contact: but they had no objections ; for our hero had long won the hearts of both mother and uncle, and they awaited quietly the time which should arrive when the young parties should no longer conceal their feel ings for each other. It was when affairs were between our hero and Emma Phillips as we have just stated, that a circumstance took place which, for a time, embittered all our hero's happiness. He was walking down High street, when he perceived a file of marines marching towards him. with two men between them, handcuffed, evidently de serters who had been taken up. A feeling of alarm pervaded our hero ; he had a it which induced him to go into a perfumer's shop and to remain there, so as to have a view of the faces of the deserters as they passed along without their being able to see him. His fore- igs were correct; one of them was his old enemy and persecutor, Furness, the schoolmaster. Had a dagger been plunged into Joey's bosom the sensation could nc painful than what once more found himself so near to his dreaded denouncer. For a short time he remained so transfixed that the w who was attending in the shop whether she should bring him a glass ot water. This inquiry made him re himself, and, complaining of a sudden pain in thi he sat down, and took the wi brought ; but he went home in des;' Tgetting the i -s which brou;:;i I it, and retired to his own room that he collect his thoughts. W3 This i \u25a0\u25a0 en brought back tu the barracks ; he would be tried and pun and afterwards be sot at liberty. How was it possil . , - avoid him, < little chance had h< search < < ojld he bribe him ? Yes, he cou nch enough; but, if he did, on up by a demand for another, and a threat of denouncement if he refused. Flight appeared his only chance ; but, to leave his present position \u2014 to leave Emma \u2014 it was impossible. Our hero did not leave his room for the remainder of the day, but retired early to bed that he might cogitate, for sleep he could not. After a night of misery, the effects of which were too visibly marked in his countenance on the ensuing morning, Joey determined to make some inquiries relative to what the f Furness might be ; and, having made up his mind, he accosted a sergeant of marines, with whom he had a slight acquaintance, and whom he fell in with in the streets. He observed to him, that he perceived they had deserters brought in yesterday, and inquired from what ship they had ted, or from the barracks. The sergeant replied that they ha from the Niobe frigate, f.nd had com mitted theft previous to desertion ; that they would remain in confinement at the barracks till the Niobe arrived, and that then they would be tried by a court martial, and, without doubt, for the double offence, would go through the fleet, Joey wished the sergeant good morning, and passed on in his way home. His altered appearance had attracted the notice of not only his partners, but of Mrs. Phillips, and had caused much distress to the latter. Our hero remained the whole day in the counting-house, apparently unconcerned, but in reality thinking and re-thin over and over again, his former thoughts. At last he made up his mind tha t he would wait lhe issue of the court-martial before he took any decided steps ; indeed, what e knew not. leave the reader to guess the state of mil h Joey remained fortnight previous to the return of the Niobe frigate from a Channel cruise. Two Her her arrival, the signal was made for a court-martial ; the sentence w n before night ; it was, thai ts were to go through the fleet on the ensuing day. This was, however, no consolation to did not feel anim lid dread of him ; he did not want his punishment, but his ire an- .-. It was about nine o'clock on ext morning, when the . that Joey came from his ov n room , he had been thinking all night, and had decided tha e but to quit Portsmo Emma, and his fair prospects for ever ; he had resolved so to do, to make this t was a bitter conclusion to arrive at,"], [121, "THE POACHER. 105 Put it had been come to. His haggard countenance, when he made his appear ance at the breakfast-table, shocked Mrs Phillips and Emma, but they made no remarks ; the breakfast was passed over in , and soon afterwards our hero found himself alone with Emma, who immediately went to him, and with tears in her eyes, said, \"What is the matter with you? you look so ill, you alarm us all, and you make me quite misei \"l.i liss Phillips \" \"Mi ' replied Emma. 11 1 1 rdon ; but, Emma afraid that I must leave you.\" \" Leave us ! \" \"Yes, leave you and Portsmouth for ever, p< I hy, what has occurred?\" \"I cannot, dare not tell; will you so far oblige me to say nothing at present ; but you recollect that I was obliged to leave Gravesend on a sudden.\" \" I recollect you did, but why I know not ; only Mary sa as not your fault.\" \" 1 trust it was not so ; but it was my misfortune. Emma, I am almost dis tracted ; I have not slept for weeks ; but believe me, when I say, that I have done no wrong ; indeed - \" We arc interrupted,\" said Emma, hurriedly; \"there is somebody coming upsta^' hardly time to remove a few feet from our hero ptain B , of the Xiobe, entered the 1 \"Good morning, Miss Phillips, I hope you are well ; I just looked in for a moment before I go to the Admiral's : we have had a catastropl board the Niobe, which I must report itely.\" ! mma ; \" nothing serious, I hope.\" \" Why no, only rid of a blackguard not worth hanging; one of the m was to have gone round the fleet this morning, when he went to the fore part of the ship under the sentry's cl loard, and di inquired Joey, seizing him by the arm. \" His name \u2014 why, how can that interest ' (Donahue? Well, if you wish to know, it was Furness.\" ' 1 am very sorry for him,\" replied our hero. \" I knew him once wh circumstam no longer - trust himself quitted the room, and went to rtment. As soon as h there he knelt down and returned thanks, not for the death of Furness, but for the removal of the load which had so op- I his mind. In an hour his relief greal that he felt himself sufficiently composed to go downstairs ; he went into the drawing-room to find Emma, but she was nol He longed to have some explanation with her, but it was not until the next day that he had an opportunity. \" I hardly know what to say to you,\" said our hero, \"or how to explain my conduct of yesterday.\" \" It certainly appeared very strange, ;ily to Captain B , who told me that he thought you were mad.\" \" I care little what he thinks, but I care much what you think, Emma ; and I must now tell you what, pf-rhaps, this man's death may permit me to do. That he has been most strangely connected with my life i- most true ; he it was who knew me, 10 would, if he could, have put me in a situation in which I must either have d myself to be thought guilty us a crime which I am incapable of, or \u2014 let it suffice to say \u2014 have done, to exculpate , what I trust I never would have done, or ever will do. I can say no more than that, without betraying a secret which I am bound to keep, and the keeping ot my own destruction. \u25a0\u25a0 you first saw me on the wayside, ia, it was this man who forced me from a happy home to wander about the world ; it was the re-appearance of this and his recognition of me, that in duced me to quit Gravesend so suddenly. I again met him, and avoided him, when as deserting; and I 1 at, as he had desened, I could be certain of living safely in this town without meeting an. It was his re-appearance here, as a deserter taken up, which put me in that state of agon .1 have seen me in for these last three weeks ; and it was the ' -dge that, after his punishment, he would be again free, and likely to meet with me when walking about here, which re solved me to quit Portsmouth, as I said to you yesterday morning. Can you, therefore, be surprised at my emotion when I heard that he was r- moved, and that then now no necessity for my quitting my kind patrons and you?\" 1 ertainly, after this explanation, I can not be surprised at your emotion ; but what does surprise me, Mr. O'Donahue, you should have a secret of such importance that it cannot be revealed, and has made you tremble at the recog nition of that man, when at the same time you declare your innocence. Did innocence and mystery ever walk hand in hand ? \""], [122, "106 THE POACHER. \"Your addressing me as Mr. O'Dona hue, Miss Phillips, has pointed out to me the impropriety I have been guilty of in making use of your Christian name. I thought that that confidence which you placed in me when as a mere boy I told you exactly what I now repeat, that the secret was not my own, would not have been now so cruelly withdrawn. I have never varied in my tale, and I can honestly say that I have never felt degraded when I have admitted that I have a mystery con nected with me ; nay, if it should please Heaven that I have the option given me to suffer in my own person, or reveal the secret in question, I trust that I shall submit to my fate with constancy, and be supported in my misfortune by the conviction of my innocence. 1 feel that I was not wrong in the communication that I made to you yesterday morning, that I must leave this place. I came here because you were living here \u2014 you to whom I felt so devoted for your kindness and sympathy when I was poor and friendless ; now that I am otherwise, you are r -leased to withdraw not only your good-will but your confidence in me ; and as the spell is broken which has drawn me to this spot, I repeat, that as soon as I can, with justice to my patrons; I shall withdraw myself from your presence.\" Our hero's voice faltered before he had finished speaking ; and then turning away slowly, without looking up, he quitted the room. CHAPTER XL. IN WHICH OUR HERO TRIES CHANGE OF AIR. The reader will observe that there has been a little altercation at the end of the last chapter. Emma Phillips was guilty of let ting drop a received truism, or rather a metaphor, which offended our hero. \" Did innocence and mystery ever walk hand in hand?\" If Emma had put that qu< to us, we, from our knowledge of the world, should have replied, \"Yes, very often, my dear Miss Phillips.\" But Emma was wrong, not only in her metaphor, but in the time of her making it. Why did she do so? Ah ! that is a puzzling question to an tti only say. at our imminent risk, when this narrative shall be perused by the other sex, that we have made the discovery are not perfect ; that the very best of the sex are full of contradiction, and i _n_ ma was a \"woman. That women very often are more endowed than the generality of men we are ready to admit ; and their cause has been taken up by Lady Morgan, Mr. Jamieson, and many others, who can write much better than we can. When we say their cause, we mean tlie right of equality they would claim with our sex, and not subjection to it. Reading my Lady Morgan the other day, which, next to conversing with her, is one of the greatest treats we know of, we began to speculate upon what were the causes which had subjected woman to man ; in other words, how was it that man had got the upper hand, and kept it? That women's minds were not inferior to men's, we were forced to admit ; that their aptitude for cultivation is often greater, was not to be denied to the assertion that man makes laws, or that his frame is of more robust material, it is no argument, as a revolt on the part of the other sex would soon do away with such advantage ; and men brought up as nursery-maids would soon succumb to women who were accustomed to athletic sports from their youth upwards. After a great deal of cogitation we came to the conclusion, that there is a great difference between the action in the minds of men and women ; the machinery of the latter being more complex than that of our own sex. A man's mind is his despot ; it works but by one single action ; it has one ruling princiole \u2014 one propelling power to which all is subservient. This power or passion (disguised and dormant as it may be in feeble minds) is the only one which propels him on ; this primum mobile, as it may be termed, is ambition, or, in other words, self-love ; everything is sacrificed to it. Now, as in proportion as a machine is simple so is it strong in its action \u2014 so in proportion that a machine is comp nes weak , and if we analyze a wo man's mind, we shall find that her in feriority arises from the simple fact, that there are so many wheels within . working in it, so many compensating balances (if we may use the term, and we use it to her honour), that, although usually more right-minded than man, her strength of action is lost, and has Die by the time that her decision has been made. What will a man allow to stand in the way of his ambition \u2014 love? no \u2014 friendship? no will sacrifice the best qualities, and, which is more difficult, make the worst that are in his disposition subservient to it He moves only one great principle, one propelling power \u2014 and the action being single, it is strong in proportion. But will a woman's mind decide in this way? Will she sacrifice to ambition, love or friendship, or natural lies? No; in her mind the"], [123, "THE POACHER. 107 claims of each are, generally speaking, fairly balanced\u2014 and the quotient, after the calculation has been worked out, although correct, is small. Our argument, after all, only goes to prove that women, abstractedly taken, have more principle, more con science, and better regulated minds than men \u2014 which is true if \u2014 if they could always go correct as timekeepers ; but the more complex the machine, the more difficult it 1 eep it in order, the more likely it is out of repair, and its movements to be disarranged by a trifling shock, which would have no effect upon one of such simple and powerful construction as that in our own sex. Not only do they often go wrong, but sometimes the serious shocks which they are liable to in this world will put them in a state which is past all repair. We have no doubt that by this time the reader will say, \"Never mind women's minds, but mind your own business.\" We left Emma in the drawing-room, rather astonished at our hero's long speech, and still more by his ffor the first time during _quaintance) venturing to breathe a contrary opinion to her own sweet self. Emma Phillips, although she pouted a .nd the colour had mounted to her .ss looked very lovely as she pensively reclined on the sofa. Re buked by him who had ah. attentive, so submissive \u2014 her creature as it were \u2014 she was mortified, as every pretty in is, at any lo< r \u2014 any symptoms of rebellion on the part of a liege vassal ; and then she taxed herself, had she done wrong? She had said \"Innocence and mystery did no; hand in hand.\" Was not that true. felt that it was true, and her own opinion was corroborated by others for she had 00k, either in Burke, or ult, or some great authoi 1 i bit the tip of her nail and th< again. Ye:., she saw how it was ; our hero world, was independent, and was wel in society; I no longer the little Jot-y of Gravesend ; he iow a person of some consequence, and he was a very ungrateful fellow ; but :ld was full of ingratitude ; still she ink better of our hero ; she certainly Well ; at all events she could prove to hi\" it,\u2014 she did not know. Thus ended cogitation the second, lother series. ; our hero said \u2014 what had he n 1 longer be- ; on him her confidence pi him for many years. This was true; but , /e positions, was not the case different? Should he now retain any secret from her? \u2014 there should be no secrets between them. There again there was a full stop before the sentence was complete. After a little more reflection, her own generous mind pointed out to her that she had been in the wrong ; and that our hero had cause to be offended with her ; and she made up her mind to make reparation the first time that they should me. Having come to this resolution, she dis missed the previous question, and began to think about the secret itself, and what it possibly could be, and how she wished she knew what it was, all of which was very natural. In the mean time our hero had made up his mind to leave Portsmouth, for a time at all events. This quarrel with Emma, if such it might be considered, had made him very miserable, and the anxiety he had lately suffered had seriously affected nth. We believe that there never was anybody in this world who had grown to man's or woman's estate, and had mixed with the world, who could afterwards say that they were at any time perfectly happy ; or who, having said so, did not sind that the reverse was the case a moment or two after the were out of their mouth. \"There is always something,\" as a good lady said to us ; and so there always is, and always I'--;. The removal of Furness was naturally a great relief to the mind of our hero ; he then felt as if all his difficulties .nted, and that he had no longer any fear of the consequences which might ensue from his father's crime. He would now, he thought, be able to walk boldly through the world without recognition, and he had built castles enough to form a metropolis when his rupture with Emma broke the magic mirror through whi had scanned futurity. When most buoy- found the truth of the good lady's saying \u2014 \"There is always something.\" After remaining ia his room for an hour. Joey went d -house, where he found Mr Sm . Sleek both at work, for their labours had in creased since Joey had so muoh neglected business. \"Well, my good friend, how do you find yourself?\" said Mr. Small. \"Very far from well, Sir. I feel that I cannot attend to business,\" replied foey, \"and I am quite ashamed of myself. I was thinking that, if you have no objection to allow me a couple of months' leave of absence, change of air would be very serviceable to me. I have something to"], [124, "fo8 THE POACHER. do at Dudstone, which I have put off ever since 1 came to Portsmouth.\" \"T think change of air will be very serviceable to you, my dear fellow,\" replied Mr. Small; \"but what business you can have at Dudstone I cannot imagine.\" \"Simply this\u2014 I locked up my apart ments, leaving my furniture, books, and linen, when I went away more than four years ago, and h \u25a0 ond time to \u25a0 f ter them.\" \"Well, they must want dusting by this time, O'Donahue, so look after them if you please ; but I think looking after your health is of more consequence, so you have my full consent to take a holiday, and remain away three months, if necessary, till you are perfectly re-established.\" \"And you have mine,\" added Mr. Sleek, \"and I will do your work while you are away.\" Our hero thanked his senior partn their kind compliance with his wishes, and stated his intention of starting the next ng by the early coach, and th' the counting-house to make preparations for his j on: i Joey joined the party, which was numer ous, at dinner. It was not until they were in lhe drawing-room after dinner that Mr. Small had an opportunity of communi cating to Mrs. Phillips what were our intentions. Mrs. Phillips considered it a very advisable measure, as Joey had evi dently Silffe' over-exertion migh n the cause, and relaxation would effect the cure. Emma, who was sitting by her mother, turned pale; she had not imagined that our hero would have followed up his ex pressed intentions of the morning, and she asked Mr. Small if he knew when O < hue would leave Portsmouth. The reply was, that he had taken his place on the early coach of the next morning ; and ta fell back on the sofa, say anything more. . n the company had all left, Mrs. Phillips rose, and lighted a chamber e stick to go to bed, and I motions of her motho: Philips shook ol pleasure, and th return quite restored in health. 1 . who found that all chance of an in i with our hero was gone, mustered up courage enough to extend hei hand, and say, \u2014 \"I hope your absi ductive of health and happiness to you, Mr. O'Donahue,\" and then follov \u25a0>\u25a0 mother. Joey, who was in no humour for versation, then bade farewell to Mr. Small and Mr. Sleek, and, before Emma had risen from not a very refreshing night's rest, he was two stages on his way from Portsmouth. CHAPTER XLl. \\HICH OUR HERO HAS HIS HEAD TURNED 'J WAY. Although it may be very proper, when an offence has been offered us, to show that we feel the injury, it often ha that we act too much upon impulse and tremities ; and this our hero felt as the coach wheelee1 second increasing his di; I 1 to take a post-chaise aud return, but the inconsistency would have been so glaring, that shame prevented him ; so he on until he reached the metropolis, and on arriving there, having nothing better to do, he went to bed. The next day he booked himself for the following day's to Manstone, and having so done, he thought he would reconnoitre the domi cile of Major and Mrs. M'Shane, and, now that Furness was no longer to be dreaded, make hi known to them. He went to Holborn accordingly, and found the shop in the same place. the usual enticing odour sent forth from the grating which gave light and air to the kitchen ; but he perceived that uie on door, and entering the coffee room, and looking spot where ing the ! a person similarly era- ) him; \u25a0, it could not be Mrs. M'Shane, as it was a man. Our hero went up to him, and inquired -till carried on the business, and vi 1 they had sold it some time back. His next inquiry, as to what had become of them, produced an \"I don't know.' mis of impatience at being rupted. 1,'nder such circumstances, our hero had nothing more to do but either tu sit down and eat beef or to quit the premises. He preferred the lattei I. where he ler of the day to I his old friends, as fate 'had from seeing them. next morning Joey set off by the coach, and arrived at Manstone a little before dusk. He remained at the principal inn of the village, called the Austin Arms,"], [125, "THE POACHER. 109 in honour of the property in the imm vicinity ; and, having looked at the various quarteri n gs si gn-board contained, without the slight \u25a0 they appertained 10 himself, he ordered supper, and looking out of the window of the first floor, discovered, at no great dis- lown the one street which composed iage, the small a' \u25a0 fore met Mary.

Why did you not say I was your brother?\" \" Bet 5 better to say nothing.\" replied Mary; \"he will not come in again.\" \u25a0'Well, I shall leave you now,\" said Joey, \"and wait till the evening; you wil! be certain to come?\" \" O yes, I certainly shall,\" replied Mary. \" Hush ! I hear my mistress with Mr. Austin. I wish you could see her, you would like her very much.\" The outer door of the study was closed I then the door of the room in which they were conversing was opened, but it was shut again immediately. \" Who was that?\" said our hero, who had not turned round to ascertain. Mrs. Austin ; she just looked in. and seeing I was engaged, she only nodded to me to say that she wanted me, I presume, and then went away again,\" replied \"You had better go now, and I will be sure to come in the evening.\" Our hero quitted the Hall; he had I he presence of his father and mother without knowing it, and all ;e he happened on both occasions to have his face turned in a wrong direction, aud he left the house as unconscious as he went in. As soon as our hero had left the HhII, Mary repaired to her mistress. \"Do you want me, Madam?\" said Mary, as she went to her mistress. \"No, Mary, not particularly, but Mr. Austin sent for me ; he was annoyed at vour having a strange person in the house, and desired me to send him away.\" \"It was my brother, Madam,\" replied Mary. \"Your brother I I am very sorry, Mary, but you know how nervous Mr. Austin is,"], [126, "THE POACHER. 110 and there is no reasoning against nerves. I should have liked to have seen your brother very much ; if I recollect rightly, you told me he was doing very well at Portsmouth, is he not?\" \" Yps, Madam ; he is now a partner in one of the first houses there.\" \"Why, Mary, he will soon have you to keep his own house, I presume, and I shall lose you ; indeed, you are more fit for such a situation than your present one, so I must not regret it if you do.\" \"He has no idea of taking a house, Madam,\" replied Mary, \"nor have I any of quitting you; your place is quite good enough for me. I promised to go down and meet him this evening, with your permission, at the Austin Arms.\" \"Certainly,\" replied Mrs. Austin, and then the conversation dropped. Our hero remained at the inn two days, a portion of which Mary passed with him, and then he set off for Dudstone ; he did not make Mary a confidant of his attach ment to Emma Phillips, although he im parted to her the death of Furness, and the relief it had afforded him, promising to return to see her before he went back to Portsmouth. Joey once more set off on his travels, and without incident arrived at the good old town of Dudstone, where he put up at the Commercial Hotel ; his only object was to ascertain the condition of his lodgings ; for the first two years he had sent the rent of the room to the old woman to whom the house belonged, but latterly no application had been made for it, although his address had been given ; and, occupied by other business more important, our hero had quite forgotten the affair, or if he did occasionally recall it to his memory, it was soon dismissed again. His key he had brought with him, and he now proceeded to the house and knocked at the door, surmising that the old woman was possibly dead, and his property pro bably disposed of; the first part of the surmise was disproved by the old woman coming to the door ; she did not reco our hero, and it was not until he produced the key of his room that she was convinced that he was the lawful w ner of its contents. She told him she could not write herself, and that the party who had written to mouth for her wa d that she felt sure he would come back at some time and settle with her ; and, moreover, she was afraid that the furniture would be much injured by having been shut up so long, which was not only very likely, but proved to be the case when the door was opened ; she also said that she could have made money for him, had he allowed her to let the lodgings furnished, as she had had several applications. Our hero walked into his apartment, which certainly had a very mothy and mouldy appearance. As soon as a fire had been lighted, he collected all that he wanted to retain for himself, the books, plate, and some other articles, which he valued for Spikeman's sake, and reminiscences, and putting them up in a chest, requested that it might be sent to the inn ; and then, upon reflection, he thought he could do no better with the re mainder than to make them a present to the old woman, which he did, after paying up her arrears of rent, and by so doing made one person, for the time, superla tively happy, which is something worth doing in this chequered world of ours. Joey, as soon as he had returned to the inn, sat down to write to Spikeman, and also to Mr. Small, at Portsmouth. having posted his letters, as he did not quit Dudstone until the next morning, he resolved to pay a visit to his former ac quaintances, Miss Amelia and Miss Ophelia His knock at the door was answered by Miss Amelia as usual, but with only one arm unoccupied, a baby being in the other, and the squalling in the little parlour gave further evidence of matrimony. Our hero was obliged to introduce himself, as he was stared at as an utter strange; ; he was then immediately welcomed, and requested to walk into the parlour. In a few minutes the whole of the family history was com municated. The old lady had been dead three years, and at her death the young ladies found themselves in possession of one thousand pounds each. This thousand pounds proved to them that husbands were to be had even at Dudstone and its vicinity. Miss Amelia had been married more than two years, to a master-builder, who had plenty of occupation, not so much in building new houses at Dudstone as in ing the old ones, and they were > well, and had two children. Her sister had married a young farmer, and she could se oney every day in the shape of bullocks and sheep upon the thev also were doing well. Joey remained an hour ; Mrs. Potts was very anxious that he should remain longer, and give her his opinion of her husband ; but this Joey declined, and, desiring to be kindly remembered to her sister, took his leave, and the next morning was on his way to London."], [127, "THE POACHER. 111 CHAPTER XLII. VERY PLEASANT CORRESPONDENCE. As soon as Joey arrived at the metropolis, he went to the correspondent of the house at Portsmouth to inquire for letters. He found one of the greatest interest from Mr. Small, who, after some preliminaries relative to the business, and certain commissions for him to transact in town, proceeded as foUows : \u2014 ' ' Your health has been a source of great anxiety to us all, not only in the counting- house but in the drawing-room ; the cause of your illness was ascribed to over-exertion in your duties, and it must be admitted, that until you were ill, there was no relax- ation on your part ; but we have reason to ise that there have been other causes which may have occasioned your rapid change from activity and cheerfulness to such a total prostration of body and mind. el grieved when I tell you that _ has been very unwell since you left, and the cause of herjllness is beyond the skill of Mr. Taylor, our medical man. She has, I .\u2022:\u25a0_ fided so much to her mother as to let us know that you are the party who has been the chief occasion of it. She has acknowledged that she has not behaved well to you, and has not done you justice; and I really believe that it is this conviction which is the chief ground of her altered state of health. I certainly have been too much in the counting-house to know what has been going on in the parlour, but I think that you ought to know us better than to suppose tl. should not in every point be most anxious for your happiness, and your being con- stantly with us. That Emma blames her- self, is certain ; that she is very amiable, is equally so , your return would give us the greatest satisfaction. I hardly need say I my niece, and am anxious for her happiness ; I love you, my dear friend, and am equally anxious for yours ; and I do trust, that any trifling d between you (for surely you must be on te terms to quarrel, and for her to feel the quarrel so severely) will be speedily overcome.

Like all the i us, she has her faults ; but if she h faults, she is not too proud to acknow them, and that you will allow when you read the enclosed, which she has requested me to send to you, and at the same time desired me to read it first. I trust this communication will accelerate your re covery, and that we shall soon see you again. At all events, answer my letter, and if I am in error, let me know, that I may undeceive others.\" The enclosure from Emma was then opene . ; it was in few words : \u2014 I v dear friend, \u2014 On reflection, I con sider that I have treated you unjustly ; I intended to tell you so, if I had had an opportunity before you quitted us so hastily. alt has preyed upon my mind ever since, and I cannot lose this first opportunity of requesting your forgiveness, and hoping that when we meet we shall be on the same friendly terms that we always had been previous to my unfortunate ebullition of temper. ' Yours truly, \u25a0 Emma.\" That this letter was a source of un qualified delight to our hero, may be easily ned. He was at once told by the uncle, and certainly Emma did not leave him to suppose to the contrary, that he might aspire and obtain her hand. Our hero could not reply to it by return of post. If distress had occasioned his illnc now prostrated him still more ; and he was compelled to return to his bed ; but he was happy, almost too happy, and he slept at last, and he dreamt such visions as only can be conjured up by those who have in anticipation every wish of their heart grati fied. The next day he replied to Mr. Small s, acknowledging, with frankness, ings towards his niece, which a sense of his own humble origin and unworthiness had prevented him from venturing to dis close, and requesting him to use his in fluence in his favour, as he dared no himself, until he had received such assur ance of his unmerited good fortune as might encourage him so to do. To Emma his reply was in few words ; he thanked her for her continued good opinion of him, the idea of having lost which had made him very miserable, assuring her that he was ashamed of the petulance which he had shown, and that it was for him to have asked pardon, and not one who had behaved so kindly, and protected him for so long a period ; that he felt much better already, and hoped to be able to shorten the time"], [128, "112 THE POACHER. of absence which had been demanded by him and kindly granted by his patrons. Having concluded and despatched these epistles, our hero determined that he would take a stroll about the metropolis. CHAPTER XLIII. A VERY LONG CHAPTER, WITH A LONG STORY, \\VH!CH COUL: WELL BE CUT IN HALF. A man may walk a long while in the city of London without having any definite object, and yet be amused, for there are few occupations more pltas-int, more in structive, or more contemplative, than looking into the shop-w . pay a shilling to see an exhibition, wher< .stance you have the advantage of seeing many without paying a farthing, provided that you look after your pocket handkerchief. Thus was our hero amused : at one shop he discovered that very gay shawls were to be purchased for one pound, Bandanas at 31. gd., and soiled Irish linen remarkably cheap ; at another he saw a row of watches, from hum! \u00a32 io<\\, to gold and enamelled at twelve or fourteen guineas, all warranted to go well ; at another he discovered that furs were at half-price, because nobod\\ them in the summer. He proceeded farther, and came to where there was a quantity of oil-paintings exposed for sale, pointing out to the passer-by, that pictures of that de scription were those which he ought not to buy. A print-shop ga*e him an idea of the merits of composition and design shown by the various masters; and as he could not transport himself to the Vatican, it was quite as well to see what the Vatican con tained ; his thoughts were on Rome and her former glories. A tobacconist's trans ported him to the State of Virginia, where many had been transported in former davs. A grocer's wafted him still farther to the West Indies and the negroes, and from these, as if by magic, to the Spice I and their aromatic groves Bat an old ay-shop, with bronzes, china, mar queterie, point-lace, and armour, embraced at once a few centuries ; and he thought of the feudal times, the fifteen. the amber-i>< cane and snuff-box of the I uught htr smiles\u2014 all gone, all dust ; the manship of the times, even portions of their dresses, still existing \u2014 everything less perishable than man.

This placard intimated that there was a mas- le at Vauxhall on that evening, be- i ire-works, water-works, and anything but good works. Our hero had heard of Vauxhall, and his curiosity and he resolved that he wculd pass away the evening in, what was at that time, a rather fashionable resorL It was half-past six, and time to go, so he directed his steps over V bridge, and, having only lost three minutes in pe i the balustrades a barges and wherries proceeding up and down the river, after asking his wa times, he found h he entrance, and, paying his admission, walked in. was a goodly sprinkling of company, but not many masks ; there was . ciad m brass armour, who stood quite motionless, for the armour v. as so heavy that he could hardly bear the He must have suffered very great , ace on such a warm night, but people stared at him as they passed by, a. was more than repaid by the atte which he attracted ; so he stood and suf- :>___.

I think you risk nothing, for he has proved that he is kind. You may then, without fear of detection, pass through the gardens, and be conducted by him to a place of safety. I will remain here for half-an-hour ; should your father and brother meet me, although they may recognize my dress, yet, not having you with me, there will be no grounds for any attack being made, and I will, after a time, return home.\" \"And what is to become of me!\" exclaimed the terrified girl. \"You must send this gentleman to my address to-morrow morning, and he will acquaint me where you are. I am giving you a great deal of trouble, Sir ; but at the same time I show my confidence ; I trust it will not interfere with your other engagements.\" \"Your confidence is, I trust, not mis placed, Sir,\" replied our hero ; \"and I am just now an idle man.

Sir,\" said he to the gentleman in the domino; 'leave us and walk back farther into the dark part. I must take her away on my arm and pass them boldly. Come, Sir, quick ! \" Our hero immediately took the young Jewess on his arm and walked towards the father and brother. He felt her trembling like an aspen as they came close to them, and was fearful that her legs would fail her. As thev passed, the face of our hero was severely s. rutiuized by the dark eyes of the Israelites. Joey returned their star I on his and after they had separated some paces from the father and brother, he whispered to the maiden, \"You are safe now.\" Joey conducted his charge through irdens, and when he arrived at the entrance, he called a coach and put the lady in. \"Where shall he drive to?\" inquired our hero. \"I don't know; say anywhere, so that we are away from this ! \" Joey ordered the man to drive to the hotel where he had taken up his abode, for he knew not where else to go. On his arrival he left the young lady in the coach, while he went in to prepare the landlady for her appearance. He stated that he had rescued her from a very perilous situation, and that he would feel much obliged to his hostess if she would take charge of the young person until she could be restored to her friends on the ensuing morning. People like to be consulted, and to appear of importance. The fat old lady, who had bridled up at the very mention of the introduction of a lady in a domino, as soon as she heard that the party was to be placed under her protection, relaxed her compressed features, and graciously consented. Our hero having consigned over his charge, whose face he had not yet seen, immediately retired to his own apartment. The next morning, about nine o'clock, he sent to inquire after the health of his ;.', and was answered by a request that he would pay her a visit. W' entered the room he found her alone. She liessed somewhat in the Oriental style, and he was not a little surprised at her extreme beauty. Her stature was rather above the middle size ; she was exquisitely formed ; and her ancles, hands, and feet, were models of perfection. She was indeed one of the most exquisite specimens of the Jewish nation, and *_hat is quite suf ficient for her portrait. She rose as he entered, and coloured deeply as she saluted Our hero, who perceived her con fusion, hastened to assure her that he was ready to obey any order she might be pleased to give him, and trusted that she had not been too much annoyed with her very unpleasant position. \" I am more obliged to you, Sir, than I can well express,\" replied she, \"by your kind consideration in putting me into the charge of the landlady of the house ; that one act assured me that I was in the hands of a gentleman and man of honour. All I have to request of y.^u now is. that you will call at No. \u2014 , in Berkeley-square, and inform Mr. S of what you have kindly done for me. You will probably rear from him the cause of the strange position in i you found us and relieved us from.\" As our hero had nothing to reply, he wrote down the address and took his . immediately proceeding to the house of 3 \u2014 \u25a0 \u2014 ; but as he was walking up"], [131, "THE POACHER. 115 Berkeley-street, h .untered by two men, whom he immediately recognized father and brother of the young Israelite ; the brother fixed his keen eye upon our hero, and appeared to recognize him ; at all events, as our hero passed them, they turned round and followed him, and he heard the brother say, \"He was with her,\" or something to that purport. Our hero did not, however, consider that it was advisable to wait until they were away before he knocked at 7he door, as he d that they were on the watch, and that any delay would not obtain the end. He knocked, and was immediately admitted. He found Mr. S pacing the room up and down in great anxiety, the breakfast remaining on the table untouched. He warmly greeted the arrival of our hero. Joey, as soon as he had informed him of he had done, and in whose hands he had placed the young lady, stated the circuinstai.ee of the father and brother being outside on the watch, and that he thought that they had recognized him. \"That is nothing more than what I expected,\" replied Mr. S ; \"but I trust easily to evade then, , they are not aware that the back of this house com municates with the stables belonging to it in the mews, end we can go out by that way without their perceiving us. I've so many thanks to offer you, Sir. for your kind interference in our behalf, that I bow to express them ; to one thing you are most certainly entitled, and I should prove but little rny sincerity if I did not immediately give it you ; that is, my confidence, and a knowledge of the parties whom you have assisted, and the circumstances attending this strange affair. The young lady, Sir, is, as you know, a Jewess by birth, and the daughter of the rabbi, a man of great wealth, and high anc.stry, for certainly Jews can claim the latter higher than any other nation upon earth , I am myself a man of fortune, as it is usually termed, at all events with sufficient to indulge any woman I should take as my wife with every luxury that can be reasonably demnde'!. I mention this to corroborate rny assertion, that it was ealth which has been ray inducement.

I have always had a great respect for the Jewish nation. I consider that evety true Christian should have ; but I will not enter upon that point now. It was probably my showing such a feeling, and my being well versed in their history, which was the occasion of an intercourse of two days ripening into a regard for one another ; and we parted with sincere wishes that we might meet again in this country. At the time I speak of, which was about three years ago, his daughter com paratively speaking, a cnild, and certainly not at that period, or indeed for some time after our meeting again in England, did it ever come into my ideas that I shouli feel anything for her but good-will ; but circumstances, and her father's confidence in me, threw us much together. She has no mother. After a time, I found myself growing attached to her, and I taxed my self, and reflected on the consequences. I \u25a0 are how very severe the Jewish laws were upon the subject of any of their family uniting themselves to a Christian. That it was not only considered that the party concerned was dishonoured before the nation, but that the whole family be came vile, and were denied the usual burial rites. Perhaps you are aware that if a Jew embraces Christianity, the same dis grace is heaped upon the relations. With this knowledge, I determined to conquer my feelings for Miriam, and of course I no longer went to her father's house ; it would have been cruel to put my (for such he certainly was) in such a position ; the more so, as, being a rabbi, he would have to denounce himself and his own children. \"My absence was, however, the cause of great annoyance to the father. He it me, and I was so pressed by him to return, that I had no choice, ut confessed my reasons, which I did not like to do. I therefore visited the house as before, although no: so frequently, and continually found myself in company with Miriam, and, her father being consr.an.iy summoned away to the duties of his office, but too often alone.

It was impossible that Miriam could be absent an hoar without being missed ; and to go out by herself without being seen was equally difficult. Her cousin is married to a Jew, who keeps the masquerade para phernalia and costumes in Tavistock- ,.nd she sometimes accompanies her father and brother there, and, a> i . ousin in the w apartment, while her male relations remain therefore hit upon this plan : on the first masquerade-night at i, dl she should persuade her father and brother to go with her to her cousin's ; that I should be close by in a coach, and, after she had gone in, I was to drive up as her customers do, and obtain two dominoes, and then wait while she escaped from the women's apartment, and came to the street door, where I was to put her in the coach, and drive off to Vauxhall.

The fact was, that our hero and Mr. S had been per ceived by Joseph and his father, as they came out of the mews, and they had im mediately followed them, taking a coach at the same stand, and desiring the coach man to follow the one our hero and Mr. S had gone into. The waiter had hardly time to make the communication before the door was forced open, and the man was so terrified that he retreated behind our hero and Mr. S . into whose arms Miriam had thrown herself for protection. The father and brother did not, however, enter without resistance on the part, of the landlord and waiters, who followed, remonstrating and checking them ; but Joseph broke from them with his dagger drawn ; it was wrenched from him by our hero, who dashed forward. The enraged Israelite then caught up a heavy bronze clock which was on the side board, and crying out, \" This for the Gaw and the Meshumed ! \" (the infidel and the apostate), he hurled it at them with all his strength ; it missed the parties it was intended for, but striking the waiter who had retreated behind them, fractured his skull, and he fell senseless upon the floor. Upon this outrage the landlord and his assistants rushed upon Joseph and his father ; the police were sent for, and after a desperate resistance the Israelites were taken away to the police-office, leaving Mr. S and Miriam at liberty. Our hero was, however, requested by the police to attend at the examination, and, of course, could not refuse. The whole party had been a quarter of an hour waiting until another case was disposed of, before the magistrate could attend to them, when the surgeon came in and acquainted them that the unfortunate waiter had expired. The depositions were taken down, and both father and son were committed, and Joey and some others bound over to appear as witnesses. In about two hours our hero was enabled to return to the where he found that Mr. S had left a note for him, stating that he considered it advisable to start immediately, lest they should require his attendance at the police court, and he should be delayed, which would give time to the relations of Miriam to take up the question ; he hail there fore, set off, and would write to him as soon as he possibly could. This affair made some noise, and ap peared in all the newspapers, and our hero therefore sat down and wrote a detailed account of the whole transaction (as com municated to him by Mr. S ), which he despatched to Portsmouth. He inquiries, and found that the sessions would come on in a fortnight, and that the grand jury would sit in a few days. He therefore made up his mind that he would not think of returning to Portsmouth until the trial was over, and in his next letter he made known his intentions, and then set ol Richmond, where he had been advised to remain for a short time, as being more favourable to an invalid than the confined atmosphere of London. Our hero found amusement in rowing about in a wherrv, up and down the river, and replying to the letters received from Mary, and from Portsmouth. He also received a letter from Mr. S , informing him of his marriage, and requesting that as soon as the trial was over he would write to him. Our hero's health also was nearly re-established, when he was informed that his attendance was required at the court to give his evidence in the case of man slaughter found by the grand jury against Joseph, the brother of Miriam. He arrived in town and attended the court on the following day, when the trial was to take place. A short time after the cause came on he was placed in the witness At the time that he gave hi positions before the magistrate he had not thought about his name having been changed ; but now that he was sworn, and had declared he would tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, when the counsel asked him if his name was not Joseph O'Donahue, our hero replied that\" it was Joseph Rushbrook. \"Your deposition says Joseph O'Dona hue. How is this? Have you an alias, many others. Sir? \" inquired the counsel. ' ' My real name is Rushbrook, but I have been called O'Donahue for some time,\" replied our hero. This reply was the occasion of the opposite counsel making some very severe remarks ; but the evidence of our hero was taken, and was indeed considered very favourable to the prisoner, as Joey stated that he was convinced the blow was never intended for the unfortunate waiter, but for Mr. S .

As soon as joey had been dismissed from the witness-box he returned to the room in which the other witnesses were assembled, with melancholy forebodings that his real name having been given in open court would lead to some disaster. He li been there long before a peac^-officer in, and said to him \u2014 \"Step this way, if you please, Sir ; I have something to say to you.\" joey went with him outside the door, when the peace-officer, looking at him full in the face, said, \" Your name is Joseph Rushbrook ; you said so in the witness box?\" \"Yes,\" replied Joey, \"that is my true name.\" \"Why did you change it?\" demanded the officer. \" I had reasons,\" replied our hero. \"Yes, and I'll tell you the reasons,\" re joined the other, \" you were concerned in a murder some years ago ; a reward was offered for your apprehension, and you absconded from justice. I see that you are the person ; your face tells me so. You are my prisoner. Nov.', come away quietly, Sir ; it is of no use for you to re sist, and you will only be worse treated.\" Joey's heart had almost ceased to beat when the constable addressed him ; he felt that denial was useless, and that the time was now come when either he or his father must suffer : he, therefore, made no reply, but quietly followed the peace-officer, who, holding him by the arm, called a coach, into which he ordered joey to enter, and, following him, directed the coachman to drive to the police-office. As soon as the magistrate had been ac quainted by the officer who the party was whom he had taken into custody, he first pointed out to our hero that he had better 7 anything wliich might criminate himself, and then asked him if his name was Joseph Rushbrook. Joey replied tint it was. \" Have you anything to say that might prevent my committing you on the charge of murder?\" demanded the magistrate. \" Nothing, except that I am not guilty,\" replied Joey. \" I have had the warrant out against him these seven years, or thereabouts, but he escaped me,\" observed the peace-officer ; \" he was but a lad then.\" \" He must have been a child, to judge by his present appearance,\" observed tlle magistrate, who was making out the com mit:al. \"I now perfectly recollect the affair.\" The officer received the committal, and in half an hour our hero was locked up with felons of every description. His blood ran cold when he found himself enclosed within the massive walls ; and, as scon as the gaoler had left him alone, he shuddered and covered his face with his hands. Our hero had, however, the greatest of all con solations to support him \u2014 the conscious ness of his innocence ; but when he called to mind how happy and prosperous he had lately been, when he thought of Emma, \u2014 and that new all his fair prospects and fondest anticipalions were thrown to the ground, it is not surprising that for a short time he wept in his solitude and silence. To whom should he make knewn his situ ation? Alas! it would too soon be known; and would not every one, even Emma, shrink from a supposed murderer ? No ; there was one who would not \u2014 one on whose truth he could depend ; Mary would not desert him, even now ; he would write to her, and acquaint her with his -situation. Our hero having made up his mind so to do, obtained paper and ink from the gaoler when he came into his cell, which he did in about two hours after he had been locked up. Joey wrote to Mary, stating his position in few words, and that the next morning he was to be taken down to Exeter to await his trial, and expressed a wish, if possible, that she would come there to see him ; and, giving a guinea to the turnkey, requested him to forward the letter. \" It shall go safe enough, young master,\" replied the man. \"Now, do you know, yours is one of the strangest cases which ever came to my knowledge?\" continued the man; \" we've been talking about it among ourselves ; why, the first warrant for your apprehension was out more than eight years ago ; and, to look at you now, you cjnnot be more than seventeen or eighteen.\" \"Yes, I am,\" replied Joey; \"I am twenty-two.\" \" Then don't ycu tell anybody else that, and I will forget it. You see youth goes a great way in court ; and they will see that you must have been quite a child when the deed was done \u2014 for I suppose by the evidence there is no doubt of that \u2014 and it won't be a hanging matter, that you may be certain of ; you'll cross the water, that's all ; so keep up your spirits, and look as young as you can.\" Mary received the letter on the following day, and was in the deepest distress at its"], [136, "120 THE POACHER. contents. She was still weeping over it, her work had been thrown down at her feet, when Mrs. Austin came into the dressing-room where she was sitting. 7 ' What is the matter, Mary ? \" said Mrs. Austin. \"I have received a letter from my brother, Madam,\" replied Mary; \"he is in the greatest distress ; and I must beg you to let me go to him immediately.\" \"Your brother, Mary! what difficulty is he in?\" asked Mrs. Austin. Mary did not reply, but wept more. \" Mary, if your brother is in distress, I certainly will not refuse your going to him ; but you should tell me what his distress is, or how shall I be able to advise or help you ? Is it very serious ? \" \" He is in prison, Madam.\" \" In prison for debt, I suppose?\" \" No, Madam ; on a charge of murder, which he is not guilty of. \" \"Murder!\" exclaimed Mrs. Austin, \"and not guilty ! Why \u2014 when \u2014 and where did this murder take place? \" \"Many years ago, Madam, when he was quite a child.\" \"How very strange!\" thought Mrs. Austin, panting for breath, and dropping into a chair. ' ' But where, Mary ? \" \"Down in Devonshire, Madam, at Grassford.\" Mrs. Austin fell senseless from her chair. Mary, very much surprised, hastened to her assistance, and, after a time, succeeded in restoring her, and leading her to the sofa. For some time Mrs. Austin remained with her face buried in the cushions, Mary stood over her. At last Mrs. Austin looked up, and laying her hand upon Mary's arm, said, in a solemn tone \u2014 1 ' Mary, do not deceive me ; you say that that boy is your brother \u2014 tell me, is not that false ? I am sure that it is. Answer me, Mary?\" \"He is not my born brother, Madam, but I love him as one,\" replied Mary. \"Again answer me truly, Mary, if you have any regard for me.

Goei mercy on n I can be done?\" And again Mrs. Austin abandoned herself to bittei Mary was in amazement ; how Mrs. Austin should know anything of Joey's history, and why she should be in such distress, was to her a complete mystery ; sbe remained for some time at the side of her mistress, who gradually became more composed. Mar)7 at last said \u2014 '\u2022 May I go to him, Madam ?\" \" Yes,\" replied Mrs. Austin, \"most cer tainly. Mary, I must have no secrets now ; you must tell me everything. You see that I am deeply interested about this young man as well as yourself ; it is quite sufficient for you at present to know that ; before I say anything more, you mint be candid with me, and tell me how you became acquainted with him, and all that you know relative to his life : that I wiil assist you and him in every way in my power ; that neither money nor interest shall be spared, you may be assured ; and I think, Man-, that, after this pro mise, you will not conceal anything from me.\" \"Indeed I will not, Madam,\" replied Mary, \"for I love him as much as I can love.\" Mary then commenced by stating that she was living at Gravesend when she first met with Joey. There was a little hesitation at the commencement of her narrative, which Mrs. Austin pretended not to observe ; she then continued, wind ing up with the information which she had obtained from Furness the marine, their escape, and her admission into Mrs. Austin's family. \"And it was Joseph Rushbrook that came with you to this house? \" \"Yes, Madam,\" replied Mary; \"but one of the men was quite rude to me Joey took it up. Mr. Austin, hearing a noise, sent down to inquire the cause ; the servants threw all the blame upon Joey, and he was ordered out of the house immediately. He refused even to come back to the Hall, after the treatment he had received, for a long while ; but it was he who was in the parlour when you opened the door, if you recollect, a few weeks ago.\" Mrs. Austin clasped her hands and then pressed them to her forehead ; after a while she said \u2014 \"And what has he been doing since he came here?\" Mary then informed her mistress of all she knew of Joey's subsequent career. \"Well, Mary,\" said Mrs. Austin, \"you must go to him directly. You will want money ; but, Mary, promise me that you will not say a word to him about what has passed between us \u2014 that is, for the present ; by-and-by I may trust you more.\" \"You may trust me, Madam,\" replied looking her mistress h \" but it is too late for me to go this after noon ; I will, if you please, now wait till to-morrow morning.\""], [137, "THE POACHER. 121 \" Do so, Mary ; I am glad that you do not go to-night, for I wish you to stay with me ; I have many questions to ask of you.

Tell Mr. Austin that I am very un well, and do not dine below.\" \"Shall I bring your dinner up here, Madam ? \" asked Mary. \" Yes, you may I ring it, Mary,\" replied Mrs. Aus'in, with a faint smile. Never did two people leave one another both so much wishing to be alone as Mary and Mrs. Austin. The former quitted the room, and, having first executed her com mission, returned to her own apartment, he might reflect without being dis turbed. What could -be the reason of Mrs. Austin's behaviour? What could she know of Joey Rushbrook? and why so interested and moved? She had heard among the servants that Mr. and Mrs. Austin were formerly in a humbler sphere of life ; that he was a half-pay officer ; but there was still no clue to such interest Joey Rushbrook. Mary thought and'thought over and over again, revolved all that had passed in her mind, but could make nothing of it ; and she was still try ing to solve the mystery, when the house maid came into the room and informed her that Mrs. Austin's bell had rung twice. Vitstin, on her part, was still more iered ; she could not regain sufficient calmness to enable her to decide how to act. Her son in prison, to be tried .for his a crime he had not committed ! Would he divulge the truth and sacrifice the father? She thought not. If he did not, would he not be condemned? and if re, cou'd she remain away from him? or ought she not to divulge what the boy would conceal? And if he did confess the truth, would they find out that Mr. Austin and Jo-eph Rushbrook were one and the , rson? Would there be any chance Would he not sooner or later be recognized? How dreadful was her situation ! Then, again, should she nt her husband with the position of m? If so, would he come forward? Yes, most certainly, he would never let Joey suffer for his crime. Ought she to tell her husband? And then, Mary, who knew so much already, who had witnessed and anguish, who was so fond son, could she trust her? Could ; mt trusting her? Such were nous and conflicting ideas which ed that she would say nothing to her husband ; that she would scud Mary hat she would that even- ac conversation with the girl, and decide, after she had talked w7ith her, whether she would make her a confidant or not. Having made up her mind so far, she rang the bell for Mary. \" Are you better, Madam?\" asked Mary, who had entered the room very quietly. \"Yes, I thank you, Mary; take your work and sit down ; I wish to have some more conversation with you about this young person, Joseph Rushbrook ; you must have seen that I am much interested about him.\" \"Yes, Madam.\" ' ' There were some portions of your story, Mary, which I do rot quite understand. You have now lived with me for five years, and I have had every reason to be satisfied with your behaviour. You have conducted yourself as a well-behaved, modest, and attentive young woman.'' \"I am much obliged to you, I for your good opinion,\" replied \" And I hope you will admit that I have not been a hard mistress to you, but, on the contrary, have shown you that I have been pleased with your conduct.\" \"Certainly, Madam, you have; and I trust I am grateful.\" \"I believe so,\" replied Mrs. Austin. \" Now, Mary, I wish you to confide in me altogether. What I wish to know is \u2014 how did you in so short a time become ac quainted with this Furness, ;_ as to obtain this secret from him? I may say, whom did you live with, and how did you live when at Gravesend ? for you bave not mentioned that to me. It seems so odd to me that this man should have told to a person whom he had seen but for a few hours a secret of such moment.\" Mary's tears fell fast, but she made no reply. \"Cannot you answer me, Mary?\" \" I can, Madam,\" said she at last ; \"but, if I tell the truth \u2014 and I cannot tell a lie now \u2014 you will despise me, and perhaps order me to leave the house im mediately ; and, if you do, what will be come of me?\" ' ' Mary, if you think I intend to take advantage of a confession extorted from you, you do me wrong ; I ask the question because it is necessary that I should know the truth \u2014 because I cannot confide in you without you first confide in me ; tell me, and do not be afraid.\" \" 'Madam, I will ; but pray do not forget that I have been under your roof for five years, and that I have been during that an honest and modest girl. I was not so once, I confess it ; \" and Mary's cheeks were red with shame, and she hung her head."], [138, "THE POACHER. 122 \"We are all sinful creatures, Mary,\" replied Mrs. Austin; \"and who is there that has not fallen into error ? The Scrip tures say, ' Let him who is without sin cast the first stone ; ' nay, more, Mary, there is more joy over one sinner that repentcth than over ninety and nine who need no repentance ; shall I then be harsh to you, my poor girl ? No, no. By trusting me you have made me your friend ; you must be mine, Mary, for I want a friend now.\" Poor Mary fell on her knees before Mrs. Austin, and wept over her hand as she kissed it repeatedly. Mrs. Austin was much affected, and as the contrite girl recovered herself, Mrs. Austin leaned on her elbow, and putting her arm round Mary's neck, drew her head towards her, and gently kissed her on the brow. \" You are indeed a kind friend, Madam,\" said Mary, after a pause, ' ' and may the Almighty reward you ! You are unhappy ; I know not why ; but I would die to serve you. I only wish that you would let me prove it.\" \"First, Mary, tell me as much of your own history as you choose to tell ; I wish to know it.\" Mary then entered into the details of her marriage, her husband's conduct, her sub sequent career, and her determination to lead a new life, which she had so sincerely proved by her late conduct. Mary having concluded her narrative, Mrs. Austin addressed her thus : \u2014 \"Mary, if you imagine that you have fallen in my good opinion, after what you have confessed to me, you are much mis taken ; you have, on the contrary, been raised. There have been few, very few, that have had the courage and fortitude that you have shown, or who could have succeeded as you have done. I was afraid to trust you before, but now I am not. I will not ask you not to betray me, for I am sure you will not. On two points only my lips are sealed ; and the reason why they ai I is, that the secret is not mine alone, and I have not permission to divulge it. That I am deeply interested in that boy is certain ; nay, that lie is a near and very dear connection is also the case ; but what his exact relationship is tow ards me I must not at present say. You have asserted your belief of his innocence, and I tell you that ycu are right ; he did not do the deed ; I know who did, but 1 dare not reveal the name.\" \"That is exactly what Joey said to me, Madam,\" observed Mary; \"and, more over, that he never would reveal it, even if he were on his trial.\" \" I do not think that he ever will, Mary, \" rejoined Mrs. Austin, bursting into \"poor boy; it is horrible that he should suffer for an offence that he has not committed.\" \" Surely, Madam, if he is found guilty, they will not hang him, he was such a child.\" \" I scarcely know.\" \"It's very odd that his father and mother have disappeared in the manner they did ; I think it is very suspicious,\" observed Alary. \"You must, of course, have your own ideas from what you have already heard,\" replied Mrs. Austin, in a calm tone ; \"but, as I have already said, my lips on that subject are sealed. What I w7ish you to do, Mary, is, not at first to let him know that I am interested about him, or even that I know anything about him. Make all the inquiries you can as to what is likely to be the issue of the affair ; and, when you have seen him, you must then come back and tell me all that he says, and all that has taken place.\" \" I will, Madam.\" \"You had better go away early to morrow ; one of the grooms shall drive you over to meet the coach which runs to Exeter.

Mary, who had now nothing to conceal, answered freely ; and when Mary wished her good night, Mrs. Austin was more than ever convinced that her boy's rectitude of principle would have made him an ornament to society. Then came the bitter feeling that he was about to sacrifice himself ; that he would be condemned as a felon, disgraced, and perhaps executed ; and, as she turned on her restless pillow, she exclaimed, \"Thank Gad that lie is innocent !\u2014 his poor father suffers ni CHAPTER XLV.

At this moment the head gaoler came to the wicket. \"She wishes to see hei , young Rushbrook,\" said the turnkey. \"Yes, certainly,\" replied the gaoler; \" walk in, and at down in the parlour for a little while till I can send a man with you.\" There was gentleness and kindness of manner shown by both the men towards Mary, for they were moved with her beauty and evident distress. Mary took a seat in the gaoler's room ; the gaoler's wife was there, arid she was more than kind. The ttrrnkey came to show her to the ceil ; and when Mary rose the gaoler's wife said to her. ' ' After you have seen yonr brother, ar child, you had better come back again, and sit down here a little while, and then, perhaps, I can be of some use to you, in letting you know what can be done, and what is not allowed.\" Mary could not speak, but she loe the gaoler's wife, her eyes brimming over with tears; the kind women une her. \"Go now,\" said she, \"and mind you come back to me.\" The turnkej7, without speaking, led her to the cell, fitted the key to the ponderous lock, pushed back the door, and remained outside. Mary entered, and in a second was in the arms of our hero, kissing him. and bedewing his cheeks with her tear.. \" I was sure that you would come, Man/,\" said Joey ; \" now, sit down, and I will tell you how this has happened, while impose yourself; you will be better able to talk to me after a while.\" The) d on the stretchers upon which the bed had been laid during the night, their hands still clasped, and as Joey entered into a narrative of all that had I, Mary's sees gradually diminished, s restored to something like composure. \"And what do you intend !o do when you are brought to trial, my dear boy?\" said Mary at last. \" I shall say nothing, except ' Not Guilty the truth, Mary; I shall make no defence whatever.\" \" But why will you not confess trie truth?\" replied Mary. \"I have often thought of this, and have long made up my mind, Joey, that no one could act as you do, if a parent's life w7ere not con cerned ; you, or anybody else, would be mad to sacrifice himself in this way, unless it were to save a father.\" Joey's eyes were cast down on the stone pavement ; he made no reply. \" Why, then, if I am right in my suppo sition,\" continued Mary \u2014 \"I do not ask you to say yds or no on that point \u2014 why should you not teU the truth? Furness told me that your father and mother had left the village, and that he had attempted to trace them, but could not; and he expressed If sure that they were gone to .re. Why, then, supposing I am right, should you sacrifice yourself for nothing?\" \"Supposing you are right, Mary,\" replied 3 still cast down, \"what proof is there that my parents have left the country? It was only the supposition of Furness, and it is my conviction that they have not. Where they may be, I know not ; but I feel positive that my mother would not leave the country without having first found out where I was, and have taken th her. No, Mary, my father and mother, if alive, are still in this country.\" collect again, my dear boy, that yonr father may be dead.\" \" And if so, my mother would have by this time found me out ; she would have used for me\u2014 done everything \u2014 I feel that she would have \u2014 she would have returned to Grassford, and \"\u2022 \"And what, Joey?\" \"I must not say what, Mary,\" replied our hero; \" I have thought a great deal since I have been shut up here, and I have taken my resolution, which is not to be \u25a0ed ; so let us say no more upon the subject, dear Mary. Tell me all about yourself.\" Mary remained another hour with Joey, and then bade him farewell ; she was anxious to return to Mrs. Austin, and acquaint her with the result of her inter view ; w7ith a heavy heart she walked away from the cell and went down into the parlour of the gaoler. \"Would you like to take anything?\" said the gaoler's wife, after Mary had sat down."], [140, "124 THE POACHER. \"A little water,\" replied Mary. \"And how is your brother?\" \" He is innocent,\" replied Mary; \"he is indeed ; but he won't tell anything, and they will condemn him.\" \"Well, well ; but do not be afraid ; he must have been very young at the time, innocent or guilty, and he won't suffer, that I know ; but he will be sent out of the country.\" \"Then I will go with him,\" replied Mary. ''Perhaps he will be pardoned, dear; keep your spirits up, and, if you have money, get a good lawyer.' an you tell me who would be a good lawyer to apply to? \" \" Yes ; Mr. Trevor ; he is a very clever man, and comes the Western Circuit ; if any one can save him, he can.\" \" I will take his name down, if you please,\" said Mary. The gaoler's wife gave Mary a piece of paper and pen and ink , Mary wrote down the name and address of Mr. 1 and then, with many thanks, took her leave. On her return to the Hall, Mary com municated to Mrs. Austin what had passed. Mrs. Austin perceived that Joey would not swerve from his resolution, and that all that could be done was to procure the best legal assistance. \"Mary, my poor girl,\" said Mrs. Austin, \" here is money which you will find neces sary for your adopted brother's assistance. You say that you have obtained the name of the best legal person to be employed in his behalf. To-morrow you must go to London, and call upon that gendeman. It may be as well not to mention my name. As his sister, you of course seek the best legal advice. You must manage all this as if from yourself.\" \" I will, Madam.\" \"And, Mary, if you think it advisable, you can remain in town for two or three days ; but pray write to me every day.\" \" I will, Madam.\" \"Let me know your address, as I may wish to say something to you when I know what has been done.\" \" I will, Al \"And now you had better go to bed, Mar)' I, you look very fatigued, my poor girl ; 1 need not caution you not to say anything to any of the servants ; good ne Mary <1).. i the bed, she was indeed worn out with anxiety and grief; at last next momii ing, in reply to the curiosity of the' servants, stated that the cause of her journey was the dangerous illness of her brother. As soon as she arrived in London, Mary drove to the chambers of the lawyer, whose direction she had obtained from the Exeter gaoler ; he was at home, and after waiting a short time, she was ushered by the clerk into his presence. \"What can I do for you, young lady?\" inquired Mr. Trevor, with some surprise; \"it is not often that the den of a lawyer has such a bright vision to cheer it. Do me the favour to take a chair.\" \"I am not a young lady, Sir,\" replied Mary; \"I have come to you to re that you will be so kind as to defend my brother, who is about to be tried.\" \"Your brother! what is he charged with?\" \" Murder,'' replied Mary ; \" but indeed, Sir, he is not guilty,\" she continued, as she burst into tears. Mr. Trevor was not only a clever but also a kind and considerate man. He remained silent for some nunutes to Mary time to recover herself. When she was more composed, he said \u2014 \" What is your brother's name? \" \"Joseph Rushbrook.\" 7 ' Rushbrook ! Rushbrook ! I well re member that name, \" remarked Mr. Trevor ; \"strange, the Christian name also the same ! it is singular, certainly. The last time I was concerned for a person of that the means of his coming into a large landed property ; now I _\u25a0 quested to defend one of the same name, accused of murder.\" Mary was astonished at this observatron of Mr. Trevor's, but made no reply. \"Have you the indictment? Where did the murder take place?\" \" In Devonshire, Sir, many years ago.\" \"And he is now in Exeter gaol ? Come, tell me all the particulars.\" Mary tolel all that she knew, in a very clear and concise manner. \" Now, my good girl,\" said Mr. Trevor, \" I must see your brother. In two days I shall be down at Exeter. If you write to him, or see him, before I do, you must tell him he must trust in his lawyer, and have no re e . to do him so much service. Allow me to ask you, a any relations in Yorkshire?\" \" No, Sir, none.\" \"And yet the name and Christian name are exactly the same. It's an odd coin cident however, changed their name into the prop name of Rusli Sir ! \" said Mary, who now thought tiiat she had a clue to Joey's parents."], [141, "THE POACHER. 125 \" Yes, changed it to Austin ; they live \u2022now in Dorsetshire. I mention it because, if interest is required for your brother, and he could prove any relationship, it luable. But, bless me! what is the matter? Smithers,\" cried Mr. Trevor, as he ran and supported Mary, \"some water! : the girl has fainted ! \" It was surprise at this astounding intelli gence, her regard for Mrs. Austin, and ihe light now thrown upon the interest she had shown for our hero, and the conviction of what must be her suffering, which had overcome the poor girl. In a short time she recovered. \"I thank you, Sir, but I have suffered so much anxiety about my poor brother,\" said Mary, faltering, and almost gasping for breath. \"He cannot be a very bad boy, since you are 50 fond of him,\" said Mr. Ti \" No, indeed ; 1 wish I was half as good,\" murmured Mary. \"I will do all I possibly can, and that immediately ; indeed as soon as I have the documents, and have perused them, I will go to your brother a day sooner than I intended. Do you feel yourself well enough to go now? If you do, my clerk shall procure you a coach. Do you stay in London? If so, you must leave your address.\" Mary replied that she intended to set off rer that evening by the mail, and would meet him there. Mr. Trevor handed her oat, put her into the coach, aud she ordered the man to drive to the inn where she was stopping. senses were quite bewildered, ft was late, and the mail was to start in an hour or two. She secured her place, and during her long journey she hardly knew how time passed away. On her arrival, in the morning, she hastened to the prison. She was received kindly as before by the gaoler and his wife, and then attended the turnkey into Joey's cell. As soon as the door was closed sh'7 threw herself down on the bedstead, and wept bitterly, quite 5S of our hero's remonstrance or attempts to soothe her. \"Oh! it is horrible \u2014 too horrible!\" ihe almost fainting gi .nust be done ! grace ! Lord, forgive me ! But my le ad is turned. That you should be here ! That you should be in this strait ! Why was it not me? I\u2014I have deserved all and more I prison, death, everything is not too bad for me ; but you, mv ioy ! \" \u25a0'M is the reason of this? I cannot undo 1 matters worse than they were before?\" said Joey. \"And why should you talk in such a way about your- r did wrong, you were driven to it by the conduct of others ; but your reformation is all your own.\" \"Ah, Joey !\" replied Mary ; \" I should think little of my repentance if I held myself absolved by \u25a0__ few years' good conduct. No, no ; a whole life of repentance is not sufficient for me; I must live on, ever repenting, and must die full of penitence, and imploring for pardon. But why do I talk of myself?\" \"What has made you thus, Mary ? \" \"Joey, I cannot keep a secret from you ; it is useless to attempt it. I have discovered your father and mother ! \" \"Where are they? and do they know anything of my position ? \" ' ' Yes, your mother does, but not your father.\" \"Tell me all, Mary, and tell me quickly.\" \" Your father and mother are Mr. and Mrs Austin.\" Joey's utterance sailed him from astonish ment ; he stared at Mary, but he could not litter a word. Mary again and Joey for some minutes remained by in silence. \"Come, Mary,\" said Joey at last, \"y7ou can now teU me everything.\" Joey sat down by her side, and Mary then communicated what had passed be tween herself and Mrs. Austin ; her ac knowledgment the ner relation; the interest she took in him ; the money she had lavished ; her sufferings, which id witnessed ; and then she wound up with the conversation between her and Mr. Trevor. \u25a0 \u25a0 You see, my dear boy, there is no doubt of the fact. I believe I did promise Mrs. Austin to say nothing to you about it ; but I forgot my promise till just this minute. Now, Joey, what is to be done?\" \"Tell me something about my father, Mary,\" said joey \"I wish to know how he is estimated, and how he behaves in his new position. \" Mary told him all she knew, which was not a great deal : he was respected ; but he was a strange man, kept himself very much aloof from others, and pr seclusion. said Joey, \"you know what were my intentions before ; they are now still more fixed. I will take my chance; but I will never say one word. Y'ou already know and have guessed more than I could wish ; I will not say that you are right, for it is not my secret.\" \"I thought as much,\" replied Mary,"], [142, "126 THE POACHER. \"and I feel how much my arguments must be weakened by the disclosures I have made. Before, 1 only felt for you ; now I feel for all. Oh, Joey ! why are you, so innocent, to be punished this way, and I, so guilty, to be spared ? \" \" It is the will of God that I should be in this strait, Mary , and now let us not renew the subject.\" \" But, Joey, Mr. Trevor is coming here to-morrow ; and he told me to tell you that you must have no reservation with your lawyer, if you wish him to be of service to you.\" \"You have given your message, Mary, and now you must leave me to deal with him.\" \"My heart is breaking,\" said Mary, solemnly. \" I wish 1 were in my grave, if that wish is not wicked.\" \"Mary, recollect one thing; \u2014 recollect it supports me, and let it support you ; \u2014 I am innocent.\" \"You are, I'm sure; would to Heaven that I could say the same for another ! But tell me, Joey, what shall I do when I meet your mother ? I loved her before ; but oh ! how much I love her now ! What shall I do? Shall 1 tell her that I have discovered all ? I do not know how I can keep it from her.\" \"Mary, I see no objection to your I her, but tell her also that I will not see her till after my trial ; whatever my fate may be, I should like to see her after that is decide \" I will take your message the day after to-morrow, ' j go and look out for lodgings, and then write to your mother. Bless you ! \" Mary quitted the cell ; she had suffered so much that she could hardly gain the gaoler's parlour, \u25a0. sat down to recover herself. She inquired of the gaoler's wife if she could procure apartments near to the prison, and the woman requested one of the turnkeys to tai which would be suitable. As soon as Mary was located, she wrote a letter to Austin, informing her of ; seen the lawyer, and that his services were secured anxiety and excie le last days, she retired to bed, and in her sleep forgot her sufferings. CHAPTER XLVI. IN WHICH OUR HERO MAKES UP HIS MIND TO BE HANGED. eero was not sorry to be left alone; for the first time he felt the absence of Mary a relief. He was almost as much bewildered as poor Mar)7, with the strange discovery ; his father a great landed pro prietor, one of the first men in the county, universally respected \u2014 in the first society ! his mother, as he knew by Mary's letters written long ago, courted and sought after, loved and admired ! If he had made .-. resolution \u2014 a promise, he might say \u2014 w hen a mere child, that he would take the onus of the deed upon his own shoulders, to protect his father, then a poacher and in humble life, how mtrch more was it his duty, now that his father would so feel any degradation \u2014 now that, being raised so high, his fall would be so bitter, his dis grace so deeply felt, and the stigma so severe! \" No, no,\" thought Joey, re I to impeach my father now \u2014 to accuse him of a deed which would bring him to the scaffold \u2014 I should not only be considered his murderer, but it would be said I had done it to inherit his posses I should be considered one who had sacrificed his father to obtain his property. I should be scouted, shunned, and de servedly despised ; the disgrace of my father having been hanged would be a trifle compared with the reproach of a son having condemned a parent to the gallows. Now 1 am doubly bound to keep to my resolution, and, come what may, the secret shall die w ith me ; \" and Joey slept soundly that night. The next morning Mr. Trevor came into his cell. \"I OJir sister, Rushbrook,\" said he, \"and, at to assist you, if it is in my power. She has been here since, I have been informed, and, if so, I have no doubt that she has told you that you must have no with yonr lawyer ; your legal friend and adviser in this case is your true frier, is bound in honour to secrecy, and were you to declare now that you were guiity of confidence would onlyiu nest in your defence. I have here all tie he coroner's : the verdict against you ; tell me honestly what did take place, and then I shall know better how to convince the ' it did not.\" \" Yoi Sir, but I can say nothing even lo \\ that, on my honour, I am not g,"], [143, "THE POACHER. 127 \"But, tell me, then, how did it happen?\" \" I have nothing more t say, and, with my thanks to you, Sir, I will say nothing more.\" \"This is very strange: the evidence is \u25a0Strong against you ; was the evidence correct ? \" \"The parties were correct in their evidence, as it appeared to them.' \"And yet you are not guilty ! \" \"I am not; I shall plead not guilty, and leave my fate to the jury.\" \"Are you mad? Your sister is a sweet young woman, and has interested me greatly; but, if innocent, you are throwing \u25a0away your life.\" ! am doing my duty, Sir; whatever you may think of my conduct, the secret dies with me.\" \"And for whom do'you sacrifice yourself in this way, if, as and as your \u25a0 .\u2022-Clares, you are not guilty?\" Joey made no reply, but sat down on the bedstead. \"If the deed was not done by you, by whom was it done?\" urged Mr. Trevor. \"If you make no reply to that, I must throw up my brief. \" \"You said just now,\" returned Joey, if I declared myself guilty of the murder, you would still defend me ; now, e I say I am not, and will not say is, you must throw up your brief. Surely you are inconsistent.\" \" 1 must have your confidence, my good lad.\" \" You never will have more than you have now. I have not requested you to defend me. I care nothing about defence.\" \"Then you wish to be hanged?\" o, I do not; but, rather than say anything, I will take my chance of it\" ' ' This is very sir. . Mr. Trevor ; a pause, he continued, \" I observe ru are supposed to have killed thi? 1 .yres, when nobody else was present ; e known to go out with your father's gun, and the keeper's evidence proved that you poached. Now, as there is no evi dence of intentional murder on your part, it is not impossible that the gun went off by accident, and that, mere boy as you must have been at that age, you were so frightened at what had taken place, that you absconded from fear. It appears to me that that should be our line of defence.\" \" I never fired at the man at all,\" said Joey. \" Who fired the gun, then? \" asked Mr. Trevor. 1 Mr. Trevor, \"I am afraid I can be of little use to you ; indeed, were it 'not that your sister's tears have interested me, I would not take up your cause. I cannot understand your conduct, which appears to me to be absurd ; your motives are inexplicable, and all I can e is, that you have committed the crime, and will not divulge the secret to any one, not even to those who would befriend you.\" -s t . \"Think of me what you please. Sir,\" rejoined our hero; \"see me condemned, and, if it should be so, executed ; and, after all that has taken place, believe me, when I assert to you \u2014 as I hope for salva tion\u2014I am not guilty. I thank you, Sir, you sincerely, for the interest you have shown for me ; I feel grateful, excess ively grateful, and the more so for what you have said of Mary ; but if you were to remain here for a month, you could gain no more from me than you have already.\" \" After such an avowal, it is useless my stopping here,\" said Mr. Trevor ; ,\" 1 must make what defence I can, for your sister's sake.\" \" Many, many thanks, Sir, for your kindness ; I am really grateful to vou,\" replied Joey. Mr. Trevor remained for a minute scan ning the countenance of our hero. There anetlnng in it so clear and bright, so unflinching, so proclaiming innocence and high feeling, that he sighed deeply as he left the cell. His subsequent interview with Mary was short ; he explained to her the difficulties arising from the obstinacy of hor brother ; but at the same time expressed his deter mination to do his best to save him. Mary, as soon as she had seen Mr. Trevor, set off on her return to the Hall. As soon as she went to Mrs. Austin, Mary apprised her of Mr. Trevor's having con sented to act as counsel for our hero, and also of Joey's resolute determination not to divulge the secret. \" Madam,\" said Mary, after some hesi tation, \"it is my duty to have no secret from you ; and I hope you will not be angry when I tell you that I have discovered that which you would have conceal, \"What have you discovered, Mary?\" asked Mrs. Austin, looking at her with alarm. \"That Joseph Rushbrook is your own son,\" said Mary, kneeling down, and kiss ing the hand of her mistress. \"The secret is safe with me, depend upon it,\" she conie id how have you made the discovery, for I will not attempt to deny it? \" Mary then entered into a detail of her conversation with Mr. Trevor. \"He asked"], [144, "128 THE POACHER. me,\" said she, \"as the sister of Joey, if we had any relatives, and I replied, ' No ; ' so that he has no suspicion of the fact. I beg your pardon, Madam, but I could not keep it from Joey ; I quite forgot my promise to you at the time.\" \"And what did my poor child say ? \" \" That he would not see you until after his trial ; but, when hrs fate was decided, he should like to see you once more. Oh ! Madam ! what a painful sacrifice ! and yet, now, I do not blame him ; for it is his duty. \" \"My dread is not for my son, Mary; he is innocent : and that to me is every thing ; but if my husband was to hear of his being about to be tried, I know not what would be the consequence. If it can only be kept from his knowledge ! God knows that he has suffered enough 1 But what am I saying? I was talking nonsense.\" \" Oh, Madam I I know the whole ; I cannot be blinded either by Joey or you. I beg your pardon, Madam, but, although Joey would not reply, I told him that his father did the deed. But do not answer me, Madam ; be silent, as your son has been ; and believe me when I say that my suspicion could not be wrenched from me even by torture. \" \"I do trust you, Mary; and perhaps the knowledge that you have obtained is advantageous. When does the trial come on?\" ' ' The assizes commence to-morrow fore noon, Madam, they say.\" \"Oh! how I long to have him in these arms !\" exclaimed Sirs. Austin. \"It is rndeed a sad trial to a mother, Madam,\" replied Mary ; \"but still it must not be until after he is \" \" \u2014 Yes; until he is condemned! God have mercy on me ! Mary, you had better return to Exeter; but write to me every day. Stay by him and comfort him ; and may the God of comfort listen lo the prayers of an unhappy and distracted mother ! Leave me now. God bless you, my dear girl ! you have rndeed proved a comfort. Leave me now.\" CHAPTER XLVH. IN WHICH OUR HERO PROVES GAME TO THE VERY LAST. Mary returned to Exeter. The trial of our hero was expected to come on on the following day. She preferred bein Joey to witnessing the agony and distress of Mrs. Austin, to whom she could offer no comfort ; indeed, her own state of suspense was so wearing, that she almost felt relief when the day of trial came on. Mr. Trevor had once more attempted to reason with Joey, but our hero continued firm in his resolution, and Mr. Trevor, when he made his appearance in the court, wore upon his countenance the marks of sorrow and discontent ; he did not, never theless, fail in his duty. Joey was brought to the bar, and his appearance was so different from that which was to be expected in one charged with the crime of murder, that strong interest was immediately ex cited ; the spectators anticipated a low-bred ruffian, and they beheld a fair, handsome young man, with an open brow and intelli gent countenance, whose eye quailed not when it met their own, and whose de meanour was bold without being offensive. True that there were traces of sorrow on hrs countenance, and that his cheeks were pale ; but no one who had any knowledge of human nature, or any feeling of charity in his disposition, could say that there was the least appearance of guilt. The jury were empanelled, the counts of the indictment read over, and the trial com menced, and, as the indictment was pre ferred, the judge caught the date of the supposed offence. \"What is the date?\" said the judge; \"the year 1 mean ? ' ' Upon the reply of the clerk, his lordship observed, \"Eight years ago!\" and then looking at the prisoner, added, ' ' Why, he must have been a child 1 \" \"As is too often the case,\" replied the prosecuting counsel ; \"a child in years but not in guilt, as we shall soon bring evidence to substantiate.\" As the evidence brought forward was the same, as we have already mentioned, as given on the inquest over the body, we shall pass it over ; that of Furness, as he was not to be found, was read to the court. As the trial proceeded, and as each fact came forth more condemning, people began to look with less compassion on the prisoner : they shook their heads and compressed their lips. As soon as the evidence for the Crown was closed, Mr. Trevor rose in our hero's defence He commenced by ridiculing the idea of trying a mere child upon so grave a charge, fora child the prisoner must have been at the time the offence was committed . \" Look at him, now, gentlemen of the jury ; eight years ago the murder of the pedlar, Byres, took place ; w hy, vou may judge for yourselves whether more than seventeen years of age; he"], [145, "THE POACHER. 129 could scarcely have held a gun at the time referred to. \" ' ' The prisoner's age does not appear in the indictment,\" observed the judge. \"May we ask his age, my I_ord ' manded one of the jury. \"The prisoner may answer the question if he pleases,\" replied the judge, \"not perhaps he may not yet be seventeen years of age. Do you state your age to the jury, prisoner? \" \" I have no objection, my Lord,\" replied - the shakes of the head of his counsel; \"I was twenty-two last month.\" Mr. Trevor Ut 'us lips at 'his unfortu nate regard for truth in our hero, and, after a eded, observing that the very candour of the prisoner, in not taking of his youthful appearance to deceive the jut)7, ought to be a strong argument in his favour. Mr. Trevor then 1 red to address the jury up ,ess of the evidence, and, as he pro- e.v, gentlemen of the jury, if this case had been ose me to give an op n, I should, i7. any previous knowledge of the prisoner, have just come to the following conclusion :\u2014 I should have said (and your intelligence and good sense will, I have no bear me out in this supposition), that, allowing that the pedlar, Byn receive his death by the prisoner's hand\u2014! say, gentlemen, tie. been the case, for I deny that it is borne out bv t'ne evidence \u2014 that it must have been that, at the sudden meeting with the pedlar, when the lad's conscience told him that what he was doing was wrong, that the gun of the prisoner was discharged unintentionally, and the consequence was fatal : I should then surmise, further, that the prisoner, frightened at the deed which ,1 unintentionally committed, had absconded upon the first impulse. That, gentlemen, I believe to be the real state of the case ; and what was more natural than that a child under such circumstances should have been frightened, and have attempted to evade the inquiry which must Tiave eventually ensued?\" \"You state such to be your opinion, Mr. Trevor ; do you wish me to infer that the prisoner pleads such as his defence ? \" asked the judge. plied Mr. Trevor, in a ing way, \" the prisoner has pleaded not guilty to the crime imputed to him.\" \"That I am aware of. but I wish to Itnow whether you mean to say that the prisoner's defence is, not having anything to do with the death of the ped upon the plea of his gun going off by accident?\" ' ' My I-ord, it is my duty to my client to make no admission whatever.\" \" I .hould think that you would be safe enough, all circumstances considered, if you took the latter course,\" obseived the humanely. srevor was now in a dilemma ; he knew not how to move. He was fearful, if he stated positively that our hero's gun >rf by accident, that Joey would deny it ; and yet if he was permitted to assert this to be the case, he saw, from the bear ing of the judge, that the result of the trial would be satisfactory. It hardly need be observed that both judge, prosecuting coun sel, jury, and everybody in court, were much astonished at this hesitation on the part of the prisoner's counsel. \" Do you mean to assert that the gun went off by accident, Mr. Trevor?\" asked the judge. \"I never fired the gun, my Lord,\" re plied Joey, in a clear, steady voice. \"The prisoner has answered for me,\" replied Mr. Trevor, recovering himself ; \"we are perfectly aware that by making a statement of accidental murder, we could safely have left the prisoner in the hands of an intelligent jury ; but the fact is, ray Lord, that the prisoner never fired ihe gun, and therefore could not be guilty of the murder imputed to him.\" Mr. Trevor had felt, upon our hero's assertion, that his case was hopeless ; he roused up, however, to make a strong appeal to the jury ; unfortunately, it was declamation only, not disproof of the charges, and the reply of the prosecuting counsel completely estabUshed the guilt rjf our hero upon what is called presumptive evidence. The jury retired for a few minutes after the summing up of the judge, and then returned a verdict against our hero of Guilty, but recommended him to mercy. Although the time to which we refer was one in which leniency was sel dom extended, still there was the youth of our hero, and so much mystery in the transaction, that when the judge passed the sentence, he distinctly stated that the royal mercy would be so far extended, that the sentence would be commuted to trans portation. Our hero made no reply ; he bowed, and was led back to his place of confinement, and in a few minutes after- the arms of the weeping Mary were encircled round his neck. \"You don't blame me, Mary?\" said Joey. \" No, no,\" sobbed Mary ; \" all that the world can do is nothing, when we are innocent.\""], [146, "THE' POACHER. 130 \" I shall soon be far from here, Mary,\" Said Joey, sitting down on the bedstead; *' but, thank Heaven ! it is over.\" The form of Emma Phillips rose up in our hero's imagination, and he covered up his face with his hands. \"Had it not been for her !\" thought he. \"What must she think of me ! a convicted felon ! this is the hardest of all to bear up against.\" \"Joey,\" said Mary, who had watched him in silence and tears, \"I must go now ; you will see her now, will you not ? \" he never will see me ; she despises me already,\" replied Joey. \"Your mother despise her noble oh, never ! How can you think \"I was thinking of somebody else, Mary,\" replied Joey. \"Yes, I wish to see my mother.\" \"Then I will go now; recollect what her anxiety and impatience must be. 1 will travel post to-night, and be there by to-morrow morning.\" \\ dear Mary, go, and God bless you ; hasten to my poor mother, and tell her that I am quite\u2014 yes \u2014 quite happy and resigned. Go now, quii_: Mary left the cell, and Joey, whose heart was breaking at the moment that he said he was happy and resigned, for he was thinking of his eternal separation from Emma, as soon as he was alone, threw himself on the bed, and gave full vent to those feelings of bitter anguish which he could no longer repress.

She remained in her own room until the post can when her first object was to secure the the butler had opened them, stating that her mistress was . and requested to see them. She took the same precaution when the other papers came in late in the day, so that Mr. Austin should not read the account of the trial ; this was the more easy to accompli he seldom looked at a As soon as the usual hour had arrived, Mary presented herself to her mistress, and com municated the melancholy result of the trial. Mrs. Austin desired Mary to say to the servant-, that she was going main with a lady, a friend of hers, some miles off, who was dangerously ill, and should, in all probability, not return that night, or even the next, if her friend was not better ; and, her preparations for the journey being completed, she set off with a little before dark on her way to Exeter. But, if Mr. Austin did not look at the newspapers, others did, and amongst the latter was Major M'Shane, who, having returned from his tour, was sitting with O'Donahue and the two ladies in the library of his own house when the post cam-, in. The major had hardly looked at the news paper, when the name of Rushbrook c bis eye ; he turned to it, read a portion, and gave a loud whistle of surprise. \"What's the matter, my dear?\" asked Mrs. M'Shane. \"Murder's the matter, my jewel,\" re turned the major; \"but don't interrupt me just now, for I'm breathless with confusion.\" M'Shane read the whole account of the trial, and the verdict, and then, without saying a word, put it into the hands of O'Donahue. As soon as O'Donahue had finished it, M'Shane beckoned him out of the room. \" I didn't like to let Mrs. M'Shane know ould take it sorely to heart,\" said M'Shane; \"but what's to be done O'Donahue?

He would then tell us how so as to procure his pardon, per ha; \"That's good advice; and now excuse are we to make for running away ?\" \"As for my wife,'' replied O'Donahue, \" I may as well tell her the truth ; she will keep it secret ; and as for yours, she will n please to tell her.\" \"And so she will, the good creature, and that's why I i bear to deceive her about anything ; but, in this instance, it is"], [147, "THE POACHER. 131 all for her own sake ; and, therefore, suppose your wife says that you must go to town immediately, and that I had better accom pany you, as it is upon a serious affair ? \" \" Be it so,\" replied O'Donahue ; \"do you order the horses to be put to while I settle the affair with the females.\" This was soon doe.e, and in half an hour the two gentlemen were on their way to ; and as soon as they arrived, which was late in the evening, they established themselves at the principal hotel. In the mean time Mrs. Austin and Mary had also arrived, and had taken up their quarters at another hotel, where Austin would be less exposed, it ,7er, too late to visit our hero when thev arrived, and the next morning they proceeded to the gaol, much about the same hour that M'Shane and O'Donahue paid their visit to Mr. Tr< Perhaps it will be better to leave to the imagination of our readers the scene which occurred between our hero and his mother, as we have had too many painful ones already in this latter portion of our nar rative. The joy and grief of both meeting again, only to part for ever \u2014 the strong conflict between duty and love \u2014 the lacer ated feelings of the doting mother, the true and affectionate son, and;the devoted servant and friend \u2014 maybe betterimagined than expressed ; but their grief was raised to its climax when our hero, pressed in his mother's arms as he narrated his adven tures, confessed that another pang was added to his sufferings in parting with the object of his earliest affections. \" My poor, poor boy, this is indeed a bitter cup to drink!\" exclaimed .Mrs. Austin; \"may God, in his mercy, look down upon you, and console you 1 \" \" He will, mother ; and when far away, not before \u2014 not until you can safely do so \u2014 promise me to go to Emma, and tell her that I was not guilty ; 1 can bear any thing but that she should despise me.\" \" 1 will, my child, I will ; and I will love arly for your sake. Now go on with your history, my dear boy.\" We must leave our hero and his mother in conversation, and return to M'Shane and O'Donahue, who, as soon as they had breakfasted, repaired to the lodgings of Mr. Trevor. M'Shane, who was spokesman, soon entered upon the business which brought them there. Mr. Trevor stated to him the pertinacity of our hero, and the impossibility of saving ,m condemnation, remarking, at the same time, that there was a mystery which aid not fathom. M'Shane took upon himself to explain that mystery, having, as we have before observed, already been sufficiently clear sighted to fathom it ; and referred to O'Donahue to corroborate his opinion of the elder Rushbrook's character. \"And this father of his is totally lost sight of, you say?\" observed Mr. Trevor. \" Altogether ; I have never been able to trace him,\" replied M'Shane. \" I was observing to hrs sister \" said Mr. Trevor. \" He hasno sister, \"interrupted M'Shane. ' ' Still there is a young woman \u2014 and a very sweet young woman too \u2014 who came to me in London, to engage me for his defence, who represented herself as his sister.\" ' ' That is strange, ' ' rejoined M 'Shane, musing. \" But, however,\" continued Mr. Trevor, \"as I was about to say, I was observing to this young woman, how strange it was, that the first time I was legally employed for the name of Rushbrook, it should be a .hicfa, in the opinion of the world, produce the highest gratification, and that in the second in one which has ended in misery.\" ' ' How do you mean ? ' ' inquired M 'Shane. \"I put a person of the name of Rush brook in possession of a large fortune. I asked our young friend's sister whether he could be any relation, but she said no.\" ' ' Young Rushbrook had no sister, I am sure,\" interrupted M'Shane. ' ' I now recollect, \" continued Mr. Trevor, \"that this person who came into the fortune stated that he had formerly held a commission in the army.\" \"Then depend on it it's Rushbrook him self who has given himself brevet rank,\" replied M'Shane. \"Where is he now?\" \"Down in Dorsetshire,\" said Mr. Trevor ; \"he succeeded to the Austin estate, and has taken the name.\" \" 'Tis he ! 'tis he ! I'll swear to it,\" cried M'Shane7 \"Phillaloo! Murder and Irish! the murder's out now. No wonder this gentleman wouldn't return my visit, and keeps himself entirely at home. I beg your pardon, Mr. Trevor, but what sort of a looking personage may he be, for, as \\ have said, I have never seen this Mr. Austin ? \" \"A fine, tall, soldierly man; I should say rough, but still not vulgar, dark hair and eyes, aquiline nose ; if I recollect right\u2014\" \" 'Tis the man ! \" exclaimed O'Donahue. \" And his wife \u2014 did you see her ? ' ' asked M'Shane. \" No, I did not,\" replied Mr. Trevor."], [148, "THE POACHER 132 \"Well, I have seen her very often,\" rejoined M'Shane; \"and a very nice creature she appears to be. I have never been in their house in my life. I called and left my card, that's all ; but I have met her seveial times ; however, as you have not seen her, that proves nothing ; and now, Mr. Trevor, what do you think we should do?\" \" I really am not prepared to advise ; it is a case of great difficulty ; I think, how ever, it would be advisable for you to call upon young Rushbrook, and see what you can obtain from him ; after that, if you come here to-morrow morning, I will be better prepared to give you an answer.\" \" I will do as you wish, Sir ; I will call upon my friend first, and my name's not M'Shane, if I don't call upon his father afterwards.\" \"Do nothing rashly, I beg,\" replied Mr. Trevor ; \" recollect you have come to me for advice, and I think you are bound at least to heat what I have to propose before you act\" \"That's the truth, Mr. Trevor; so now, with many thanks, we will take our leave, and call upon you to-morrow.\" M'Shane and O'Donahue then proceeded to the gaol and demanded permission to see our hero. \" There are two ladies with him, just now,\" said the gaoler; \"they have been there these three hours, so I suppose they will not be much longer.\" \" We will wait then,\" replied O'Donahue. In about a quarter of an hour Mrs. Austin and Mary made their appearance ; the former was closely veiled when she entered the gaoler's parlour in which O'Doi and M'Shane were waiting. It had not been the intention of Mrs. Austin to have gone into the parlour, but her agitation and distress had so overcome her that she could scarcely walk, and Mary had per suaded her as she came down to go in and take a glass of water. The gentlemen rose when she came in; she immedi recognized M'Shane, and the sudden rush into her mi, hat might be the issue of the meeting, was so overwhelm ing, that she dropped into a chair and sainted. Mary ran for some water, and while she did so, M'Shane and O'Donahue went to the assistance of Mrs. Austin. Tl was removed, and, of course, she was im mediately recognized by M'Shane, who was now fully convinced that Austin and Rushbrook were one and the same person. Upon the first signs of returning anima tion, M'Shane had the delicacy to with draw, and making a sign to the gaoler, he and O'Donahue repaired to the cell of our hero. The greeting was warm on both sides. M'Shane was eager to enter upon the subject ; he pointed out to Joey that he knew who committed the murder; indeed, plainly told him that it '.vas the deed of his father. But Joey, as before, would admit nothing ; he was satisfied with their belief in his innocence, but, having made up his mind to suffer, could not be per suaded to reveal the truth, and M'Shane and O'Donahue quitted the cell, perceiv ing that unless most decided steps were taken, without the knowledge of our hero, there was no chance of his being extricated from his melancholy fate. Struck with admiration at his courage and self-devotion towards an unworthy parent, they bade him farewell, simply promising to use all their endeavours in his behalf. CHAPTER XLIX. THI. INTERVIEW. According to their arrangement, on the following morning, M'Shane and O'Dona hue called upon Mr. Trevor, and after half an hour's consultation, it was at last decide he] should make an a to see Austin, and bide the issue of the interview, when they would again com municate with the lawyer, who v. return to town on the following day. They then set off as fast as four horses could convey them, and drove direct to the Hall, where they arrived about six o'clock m the evening. It had so happened that Austin had the evening before inquired for his wife. The servant reported to him what Mary had told them, and Austin, who was in a fidgety humour, had sent for the coachman who had driven the carriage, to inquire w Mrs. Austin's friend was very ill. The coachman stated that he had not driven over to the place in question, but to the nearest post-town, where Mrs. Austin had taken a post-chaise. This mystery and concealment on the part of not very agreeable to a man of Mr. Austin's temper ; he was by turns indignant and d ; and after having passed a sleep less night, had been all the day anxiously ng Mrs- Austin's return, when the i of wheels was heard, and the ear- ns M'Shane drove up to the door. a'iry if Mr. Austin was at home, the servants replied that they would as' i and Austin, who imagined that this uu-"], [149, "THE POACHER. 133 usual visit might be connected with his wife's mysterious absence, desired the but ler to show in the visitors. Austin started at the announcement of the names, but recovering himself, he remained standing near the table, drawn up to his full height. \"Mr. Austin.\" said O'Donahue, \"we have ventured to call upon you upon an I some importance: as Mr. Austin, we have not the pleasure of your acquaint ance, but we were formerly, if I mistake not, serving his Majesty in the same regiment.\" \"I do not pretend to deny, gentlemen, that you once knew me under different circumstances,\" replied Austin, hae vou please to be seated, and then probably you will favour me with the cause of this visit.\" \" May I inquire of you, Mr. A, f you may have happened to look ove, ipers within these tys? \" \" No 1 and now I recollect \u2014 whi unusual \u2014 the papers have not been brought to me regula \"Thev were probably withheld from you in consequence of the intelligen woulrl have conveyed to you.\" \"May I ask what that intelligence may be?\" inquired Austin, surprised. \"The trie . and sentence to transportation for life of one Joseph Rush- brook, for the murder of a man of the name of Byres,\" replied M'Shane. \" Mr. Austin, you are of course aware tha1 your son.\" \"You have, of course, seen the and he has made that statement to you ? \" replied Mr. Austin. e have seen the party, but he has not made that statement,\" replied O'Dona- hue ; \"but do you pretend to deny it?\" \" I an. not aware upon what grounds you have thought proper to come here to interrogate me,\" replied Austin. \"Sup- that I had a son, and that son Las, as you say, been guilty of the deed, it certainly is no concern of yours.\" . th your leave, Mr. Austin,\" said M 'Shane-, \"let me prove that he is your son. You were living at Grassford, the murder was committed ; your n away in consequence, and fell into the hands of Captain (now General) O'Do7 him your son was made over to me, and I adopted him ; but having been recognized, when at school, by Fur ness, the schoolmaster of the village, he absconded to avoid being apprehended ; ave never seen him from that time \u25a0\u2022 rday morning, when I called upon him, and had an interview, as soon as his mother, Mrs. Austin, had quitted the cell in Exeter gaol, where he is at present con fined.\" the cause of Mrs. Austin's absence explained ; a could he any longer refuse to admit that Joey was his son. After a silence of a minute, he replied \u2014 \"I have to thank you much for your kindness to my poor boy, Major M'Shane ; and truly sorry am I that he is in dilemma. Now that I am acquainted with it, I shall do all in my power. There are other Rushbrooks, gentlemen, aud you cannot be surprised at my not immediately admitting that such adisgr_.ee has occurred to my own family. Of Mrs. Austin having been with him I assure you I had not any idea ; her having gone there puts it beyond a doubt, although it has been carefully conceale-d from me till this moment.\" It must not be supposert that because Austin replied so calmly to Major M 'Shane, he was calm within. On the contrary, from the very first of the interview he had been in a state of extreme excitement, and the s7ruggle to command his feelings was terri ble ; indeed, it was now so painfully ex pressed in his countenance, that O'Donahue said \u2014 ' ! Perhaps, Mr. Austin, you will allow me to ring for a little water ? \" \" No, Sir, thank you,\" replied Austin, gasping for breath. 'Since you have admitted that Joseph Rushbrook is your son, Mr. Austin,\" con- . M'Shane, \"your own flesh and blood, may I inquire of you what you in tend to do in his behalf? Do you intend to allow the law to take its course, and your son to be banished for life ?\" \"What can I do, gentlemen? He has been tried and condemned : of course, if any exertion on my part can avail \u2014 but I fear that there is no chance of that. \" ' r. Austin, if he were guilty I should ive interfered ; but, in my opinion, he is innocent ; do you not think -o ? \" \"I do not believe, Sir, that he ever would have done such a deed ; but that avails nothing, he is condemned.\" \" I grant it, unless the real murderer of the pedlar could be brought forward.\" \"Y-e-s,\" replied Austin, trembling. \"Shall I denounce him, Mr. Austin?\" \"Do you know him?\" replied Austin, starting on his feet. \"Yes, Rushbrook,\" replied M'Shane, in a voice of thunder, \" I do know him, \u2014 'tis yourself! \" itin could bear up no longer, he fell down on the floor as if he had been shot. O'Donahue and M'Shane went to his assistance; they raised him up, but he"], [150, "THE POACHER. *34 was insensible ; they then rang the bell for assistance, the servant came in, medical advice was sent for, and M'Shane and O'Donahue, perceiving there was no chance of prosecuting their intentions, in Mr. Austin's present state, quitted the Hall just as the chaise with Mrs. Austin and Mary drove up to the door. CHAPTER L. IN WHICH IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE STORY WINDS UP TO THE SATIS- FACTION OF THE READER. It was not for some time after the arrival of the medical men that Mr. Austa be recovered from his state of insensibility, and when he was at last restored to life, it was not to reason. He raved wildly, and it was pronounced that his attack was a brain fever. As, in his incoherent ex clamations, the name of Byres was fre quently repeated, as soon as the medical assistance had withdrawn, Mrs. Austin desired all the servants, with the exception of Mary, to quit the room ; they did so with reluctance, for their curiosity was excited, and there was shrugging of the shoulder-, and whispering, and surmising, and repeating of the words which had escaped from their unconscious master's lips, and hints that all was not right passed from one to the other in the servant In the mean time, Mr . Austin and Mary remained with him ; and well it the servants had been sent were not to know what had taken place so long ago, for now Austin played the whole scene over meed himself as a murderer, spoke of his son, and of his remorse, and then imagine him self in conflict with Byres\u2014 he clenched his fists \u2014 and he laughed and chuckled \u2014 and then tions for lhe deed which he had done. \"Oh, Mary, how is this to end?\" ex claimed Mrs. Austin, after one of the paroxysms had subsided. \"As guilt always must end, Madam,\" iry, bursting into tears, and misery.\" \"My dear Mary, do not distress your self in that manner ; you are no longer guilty.\" \"Nor is my master then, Madarr I am sure that he has repented.\" \"Yes, ia tas repented most sincerely; one ha ittered his whole life \u2014 he never has been happy since, and never will be until he is in heaven.\" \"Oh, what a happy relief it would be to him!\" replied Mary, musing. \"I wish that I was, if such wish is not sinful.\" ' ' Mary, you must not add to my distress by talking in that manner ; I want your support and consolation now.\" \"You have a right to demand every thing of me, Madam,\" replied Mary, \"and I will do my best, I will indeed ; I have often felt this before, and I than'. God for it ; it will make me more humble.\" fever continued for many days, during which time Mr. Austin was attended solely by his wile and Mary ; the latter had written to our hero, stating the cause of her absence from him in so trying a period, and had received an answer, stating that he had received from very good authority the information that he was not likely to leave the country for some weeks, and re questing that Mary would remain with his until his father's dangerous illness was decided one way or the Cher ; he stated that he should be perfectly satisfied if he only saw her once before his de parture, to arrange with her relative to her and to give her legal autho. act so- him, previous to his removal from the country. He told her that he had perceived an advertisement in the London papers, evidently put in by his friends at Portsn handsome r to any one who could give any ace\" him \u2014 and that he was fearful that some of those who were at the trial would read it, (lake known his position , he begged Mary to if it wera only a few lines, and sr- 1 love to his mother.

This intelligence was communicated to his wife, who wept anc wished, but dared not utter what she wished ; Mary, however, took an oppor- when Mrs. Austin had quitted the etistin, who was in such a feeble state that he could hardly speak, that the time would soon come when he would be summoned before a tribunal, and conjured him by the hopes t of forgiveness, now that the world was fading away before his eyes, to put all pride, and to do that justice to in which our hero's noble conduct is him demanded \u2014 to make a con fession either in writing or in presence of witnesses, before he died \u2014 which would the innocence of his only child, the heir to the property and the name. There was a struggle, and a long one, in the proud heart of Mr. Austin before he could consent to this act of justice. Mary had pointed out the propriety of it early in the morning, and it was not until late in the evening, after having remained in silence and with his eyes closed for the day, that Austin made a sign to his wife to bend down to him, and desired her in a half-whisper to send for a magl His request was immediately attended to ; and in an hour the summons was answered whom Austin had been on good terms. Austin made his deposition epported by Mary while he signed the paper. It was done ; and when she would have removed the pen from his fingers, she found that still held fast, and that his head had fallen back ; thi: conflict between his pride and this act of du , tec overpo for him in his weak conditioi Austin was dead before the ink of his signature had time to dry. The gentleman who had seen summoned in his capacity of magistratt thought it advisable to remove' from the scene \u25a0 tress without attempting to communicate with Mrs. Austin in h_r present cl. \u25a0versation with O'Dona- hue and M'Shane at the time that he was summoned, and Mr. Austin's illness and the various reports abroad had been there canvassed. O'Donahue and M'Shane had 1 the secret ; but when their friend was sent for, anticipating that some such would take place, they requested him to return to them from the Hall ; he did so, and acquainted them with had passed. \"There's \u25a0 lose, then.\" said ine ; \"I will, if you please, . \u25a0copy of this deposition.\" O'Donahue er, :ered into a brief narrative os the circumstances and the behaviour of our hero ; and, as soon as the copy of the deposition had been attested by the magis- he and M'Shane ordered horses, and set off for London. They knocked up Mr. Trevor at his private house in the middle of the night, and put the document into his hands. \"Well, Major M'Shane, I would gladly have risen from a sick bed to have had this paper put into my hands ; we must call upon the Secretary of State to-morrow, and I have no doubt but that the poor lad will be speedily released, take possession of his property, and be an honour to the country.\" \"An honour to old England,\" replied \u25a0 ne ; \" but I shall now wish you good night.\" Shane, before he went to bed, imme diately wrote a letter to Mrs. Austin ac quainting her with what he had done, and the intentions of Mr. Trevor, sending it by express ; he simply stated the facts, with out any comments. But we must now return to Portsmouth. The advertisement of Mr. Small did not escape the keen eye of the police-constable who had arrested our hero \u2014 as the reader must recollect the arrest was made so quietly that no one was aware of the cir cumstance, and as the reward of _fioo would be a very handsome addition to the .\u00a3200 which he had already received \u2014 the man immediately set off for Portsmouth on the outside of the coach, and went to mall, where he found him in the counting-house with Mr. Sleek. He soon introduced himself, and his business with them ; and such was Mr. Small's impa tience that he immediately signed a cheque for the amount, and handed it to the 0 then bluntly told him that our hero had been tried for murder, and sentenced to transportation, his real name being Rushbrook and not O'Dona hue. This was a heavy blow to Mr. Small: having obtained all the particulars from the police -constable, he dismissed him, and was for some time in consultation with -aeek ; and as it would be imp long to withhold the facts, it was thought advisable that Mrs. Phillips and Emma should become acquainted with them im mediately, the more so as Emma had ac knowledged that there was a mystery about our hero, a portion of which s' acquainted v Mrs. Phillips was the first party to whom the intelligence was communicated, and she was greatly distressed. It was some time before she could decide upon whether"], [152, "136 THE POACHER. Emma, in her weak state, should be made acquainted with the melancholy tidings, but as she had suffered so much from suspense, it was at last considered advis able that the communication should be made. It was done as cautiously as possible ; Emma was not so shocked as they supposed she would have been at the intelligence. have been prepared for this, or something like this,\" replied she, weeping in her mother's arms, \"but I cannot I that he has done the deed ; he told me that he did not, when he was a child ; he has asserted it since. Mother, I must \u2014 I will go and see him.\" \"See him, my child ! he is confined in gaol.\" \" Do not refuse me, mother, you know not what I feel \u2014 you know not \u2014 I never knew myself till now how much I loved him. See him I must and will. Dearest mother, if you value my life, if you would not drive reason from its seat, do not refuse me.\" Mrs. Phillips found that it was in vain to argue, and consulted with Mr. Small, who at length (after having in vain re monstrated with Emma) decided that her request should be granted, and that very day he accompanied his niece, travelling ali night, until they arrived at Exeter. In the mean time Mrs. Austin had re mained in a state of great distress ; her husband lay dead ; she believed that he had confessed his guilt, but to what extent she did not know, for neither she nor Mary had heard what passed between him and the magistrate. She had no one but Mary to confide in or to console, no one to advise with or to consult. She thought of sending for the magistrate, but it would appear indecorous, and she was all ai and doubt. The letter from M 'Shane, which arrived the next afternoon, relieved her at once ; she felt thai, her boy was safe. [ary, dear, read this; he is safe,\" exclaimed she ; \" God of heaven, accept rateful tears.\" mnot you spare m. ?\" re- \u25a0 rry, returning the li are you.

My dear, dear child.\" ry did not wait a second command ; she sont for post-horses, and in hall an as on her way to Exeter ; travelling is much spi ma and her uncle, she arrived there but a few hours after tl Our hero had been anxiously waiting for Mary's daily communication, the post time had passed, and it had not arrived. Pale and haggard from lon\u00a3 consineirent and distress of mind, he was pacing up and down, when the bolts were turned, and Emma, supported by her uncle, eniered the cell. At the sight of her, our hero uttered a cry, and staggered agains; the wall ; he appeared to have lost his self-control. \" Oh,\" said he, \" this might have been spared me, I have not deserved Emma, hear me. As I hope for future happiness, I am innocent; I am \u2014 I am, indeed \u2014 ,\" and he fell sense less on the pavement. Mr. Small raised him up and put him on the bed ; after a time he revived, and remained where he had been laid, sobbing convulsively. As soon as he became more composed, Emma, who had been sitting by him, the tears coursing each other down her pale cheeks, addressed him in a calm voice. ' ' I feel \u2014 1 am sure that you are innocent, or I should not have been here.\" \" Bless you for that, Emma, bless you ; those few words of yours have given me more consolation than you can imagine. Is it nothing to be treated as a felon, to be disgraced, to be banished to a distant country, and that at the very time that I full of happiness, prosperous, and anticipating? \u2014 (but I cannot dwell upon that). Is it not hard to bear, Emma? and what could support me, bu^. the con sciousness of my own innocence, and the assurance that she whom I love so, and whom I now lose for ever, still believes me is a balm ; a consolation ; and I will now submit to the will of Heaven.\" Emma burst into tears, leaning her face on our hero's shoulders. After a time she replied, \"And am I not to be pitied? Is it nothing to love tenderly, devotedly, madly \u2014 to have given my heart, my whole thoughts, my existence to one object \u2014 (why should T conceal it now?)\u2014 to have been dwelling upon visions of futurity so pleasing, so delightful, all rig away as a dream, and leaving a sad reaUty like this ? promise; you will not refuse Emma \u2014 who by your side when you first met her, she who is kneeling before you n \" I dare not, Emma, for my heart tells me that you would propose a step which must not be you must leave me now, and so-* i \"For ever! for ever!\" cried springing on her feet. \" Mo ! no !\u2014 u .

We must allow the day to pass away ; during which Emma and our hero, M 'Shane and Mary, were sitting together; tears of misery w7iped away \u2014 tears of joy still flow ing and glistening with the radiance of intermingled smiles. The next morning M'Shane and O'Dona hue arrived, the Secretary of State had given immediate orders for our hero's release, and they had brought the docu ment with them. The following day they w7ere all en route, Emma and her uncle to Portsmouth, where they anxiously awaited the arrival of our hero as soon as he had performed his duty to his parents. We must allow the reader to suppose of Mrs. Austin in once more holding her child in her embrace, and the smiles and happiness of Mary at his triumphant acquittal ; the wondering of the domestics, the scandal and rumour of the neigh bourhood. Three days sufficed to make all known, and by that time Joey was looked upon as the hero of a novel. On \"th day he accompanied the remains of his father as chief mourner. The funeral was quiet without being mean ; there was no attendance, no carriages of the neighbouring gentry followed. Our hero was quite alone and unsupported ; but when the ceremony was over, the want of respect shown to the memory of Iris father was more than atoned for by the kindness and consideration shown towards the son, who was warmly, yet delicately, welcomed as the future proprietor of the Hall. Three months passed away, and there was a great crowd before the house of Mr. Small, navy-agent, at Portsmouth. There large company assembled, the O'Donahues, the M 'Shanes, the Spike- mans, and many others. Mrs. Austin was there, looking ten years younger ; and Mary was attending her at the toilet, both of them half smiles, half tears, for it was the morning of our hero's wedding day. Mr. Small strutted about in white smalls, and Mr. Sleek spluttered over everybody. The procession went to the church, and soon after the ceremony, one couple of the party set off for the Hall ; where the others went is of no consequence. have now wound up the history of little Joey Rushbrook, the poacher. We have only to add, that the character of our hero was not the worse as he grew older, and was the father of a family. The Hall was celebrated for hospitality, for the amiability of its possessors, and the art which they possessed of making other people happy. Mary remained with them more as a confidant than as a servant ; in deed, she had so much money, that she re ceived several offers of marriage, which she invariably refused, observing with the true humbleness of a contrite heart, that she was undeserving of any honest, good man. Everybody else, even those who knew her history, thought otherwise ; but Mary continued firm in her resolution. As for all the rest of the personages introduced into these pages, they passed through life with an average portion of happiness, which is all that can be expected. In conclusion, we have only one remark to make. In this story we have shown how a young lad, who commenced his career with poaching, ultimately became a gentleman of \u00a3j,<xx> a-year , but we must remind our youthful readers, that it does not follow that ever)7 one whe com mences with poaching is to have the same good fortune. We advise them, therefore, not to attempt it, as they may find that instead of a-year, they may stand a chance of going to where our hero very narrowly escaped from being sent ; that is, to a certain portion of her Majesty's do minions beyond the seas, latterly termed Australia, but more generally known by the appellation of Botany Bay. THE END."], [154, ""], [155, "A RENCONTRE"], [156, ""], [157, "A RENCONTRE. One evening I was sitting alone in the salle ei manger of the Couronne ei' Or, at Boulogne, when Colonel G , an old acquaintance, came in. After the first greeting he took a chair, and was soon as busily occupied as I was with a cigar, which was occasionally removed from our lips as we e.sked and replied to questions as to what had been our pursuits subsequent to our last rencontre. After about half an hour's chit-chat, he observed, as he lighted a fresh cigar \u2014 - \" When I was last in this room I was in companv with a veiy strange personage.\" ' Male or female?\" inquired I. emale, \" replied Colonel G . \" p.\\_ together it's a story worth telling, and as it will pass away the time, I will relate it you \u2014 unless you wish to retire.\" As I satisfied him that I -.vas not anxious to go to bed, and very anxious to hear iris story, he narrated it as near as I can recol- the following words : \u2014 \" I had taken my place in the diligence from Paris, and when I arrived at Dame der Vicloires it was all ready for a start ; the luggage, piled up as high as an English haystack, had been covered over and buckled down, and the conducteur was calling out for the passengers. I took my last hasty whiff of my cigar, and un- willingly threw away more than half of a really good Havannah ; for I perceived that in the intti-ieur, for which I had booked myself, there was one female al- ready seated : and women and cigars are such great luxuries in their respective ways, that they are not to be indulged in at one and the same time\u2014 the world would be tppy, and happiness, we are told, is not for us here below. Not that I agree with that moral, although it comes from very high authority ; \u2014 there is a great deal of happiness in this world, if you knew how ret it; or rather, I should say, of ire : there is a pleasure in doing good ; there is a pleasure, unfortunately, in doing wrong ; there is a pleasure in looking forward, ay, and in looking back- ward also ; there is pleasure in loving and being loved, in eating, in drinking, and though last, not least, in smoking. I do not mean to say that there are not the drawbacks of pain, regret, and even re morse ; but there is a sort of pleasure even in them : it is pleasant to repent, because you know that you are doing your duty ; and if there is no great pleasure in pain, it precedes an excess when it has left you. I say again, that, if you know7 how to extract it, there is a great deal of pleasure and of happiness in this world, especially if you have, as I have, a very bad memory. \" ' A lions, Messieurs ! ' said the conduc teur; and when I got in I found myself the sixth person, and opposite to the lady : for all the other passengers were of my own sex. Having fixed our hats up to the roof, wriggled and twisted a little so as to get rid of coat-tails, &c. , all of which was effected previous to our having cleared Rue Notre Dame des Victoircs, we began to scrutini-e each other. Our female com panion's veil was down and doubled, so that I could not well make her out ; my other four companions were young men, all Frenchmen, apparently good-tempered, and inclined to be agreeable. A few seconds were sufficient for my reconnoitre of the gentlemen, and then my eyes were naturally turned towards the lady. She was muffled up in a winter cloak, so that her figure was not to be made out ; and the veil still fell down before her face, so that only one cheek and a portion of her chin could be deciphered :\u2014 that fragment of her physiognomy was very pretty, and I watched in silence for the removal of the veil. \"I have omitted to state that, before I got into the diligence, I saw her take a very tender adieu of a very handsome woman ; but as her back was turned to me at the time, I did not see her face. She had now fallen back in her seat, and seemed disposed to commune with her own thoughts : that did not suit my views, which were to have a f her face. Real politeness would have induced me to have left her to herself^"], [158, "A RENCONTRE. 142 but pretended politeness was resorted to that I might gratify my curiosity ; so I inquired if she wished the window up. The answer was in the negative, and in a very sweet voice ; and then there was a pause, of course \u2014 so I tried again. \" ' Vou are melancholy at parting with your handsome sister,' observed I, leaning forward with as much appearance of interest as I could put into my beautiful phiz. \" 'How could you have presumed that she was my sister ? ' replied she. \" 'From the strong family likeness,\" re joined I, ' I felt certain of ft' \" ' But she is only my sister-in-law, Sir \u2014 my brother's wife.' \" ' Then, I presume, he chose a wife as like his sister as he could find . nothing more natural \u2014 I should have done the same.' \" ' Sir, you are very polite,' replied the lady, who lowered down the window, add ing. ' I like fresh air.' \" ' Perhaps you will find yourself less in commoded if you take off your veil ? ' \" ' I will not ascribe that proposition to curiosity on your part, Sir,' replied the lady, \u2022as you have already seen my fac_.' \" ' You cannot, then, be surprised at my wishing to see it once more.' \" ' You are very polite, Sir.' \" Although her voice was soft, there was a certain quickness and decision in her manner and language which were very remarkable. The other passengers now addressed her, and the conversation became general. The veiled lady took her share in it, and showed a great deal of smartness and repartee. In an hour more we were all very intimate. As we changed horses, I took down my hat to put into it my cigar case which I had left in my pocket, upon which the lady observed, ' You smoke, I perceive ; and so, I dare say, do all the rest of the gentlemen. \u2014 Now, do not mind me; I am fond of the smell of tobacco \u2014 I am used to it.' \"We hesitated. ' ' Nay, more, I smoke myself, and will lake a cigar with you.' \" 'This was decisive. I offered my cigar case \u2014 another gentleman struck a light. Lifting up her veil so as to show a very pretty mouth, with teeth as white as snow, she put the cigar in her mouth, and set us the example. In a minute both windows were down, and every one had a cigar in his mouth. \" ' Where did you k-arn to smok> dam ? ' was a question put to ; ' \u25a0 by the 1 ho sat next to her. \" ' Where? \u2014 In the camp \u2014 Africa--' where.

Were you at Constantine?' ' ' ' Yes, I was ; I followed the army during the whole campaign.' \"The diligence stopped for supper or dinner, whichever it might be considered, and the conducteur threw open the doors. ' Now,' thought I, ' we shall see her face ; ' and so, I believe, thought the other pas sengers : but we were mistaken ; the ladv went up-stairs and had a basin of soup taken to her. When all was ready we found her in the diligence, with her veil down as before. \"This was very provoking, for she was so lively and witty in conversation, and the feature? of her face which had been dis closed were so perfect, that I was really quite on a fret that she would leave me without satisfying my curiosity : \u2014 they talk of woman's curiosity, but we men have as much, after all. It became dark , lady evidently avoided further conversation, and we all composed ourselves as well as ould. It may be as well to state in few words, that the next morning she was as cautious and reserved as ever. The diligence arrived at this hotel \u2014 the pas sengers separated\u2014 and I found that the lady and I were the only twro who took up our quarters there. At all events, the Frenchmen who travelled with us went away just as wise as they cam-.:. \" ' You remain here? ' inquired I, as soon as we had got out of the diligence. \" 'Yes,' replied she. 'And you ' \" 'I remain here, certainly; but I hope you do not intend to remain a' It is too cruel of you.\" \" ' I must go to my room now and make myself a little more comfortable ; after that, Mons. l'Anglais, I will speak to you.

As a child, I was wakened up with the drum and fife, and went to sleep with the bugles ; as a girl, I became quite conversant with every military ma n\u0153uvre ; and now that I ara a woman grown, I beheve that I am more fit for the baton than one half of those marshals who have gained it. I have studied little else but tactics ; and have, as my poor husband said, quite a genius for them \u2014 but of that hereafter. I was married at sixteen, and have ever since followed my husband. I followed him at last to his grave. He quitted my bed for the bed of honour, where he sleeps in peace. We'll driru to his memory.' \"We emptied our glasses, when she continued ; \u2014 \"'My husband's regiment was not ordered to Africa until after the first dis astrous attempt upon Constantine. It fell to our lot to assist in retrieving the honour of our army in the more successful expedi tion which took place, as you of course are aware, about three months ago. I will not detain you with our embarkation or voyage. We landed from a steamer at Bona, and soon afterwards my husband's company were ordered to escort a convoy of provisions to the army which were col lecting at Mzez Ammar. Well, we ar rived safely at our various camps of Drean, Nech Meya, and Amman Berda. We made a little ddtour to visit Ghelma. I had curiosity to see it, as formerly it was an important city. I must say that a more tenable position I never beheld. But I tire you with these details.' \" ' On the contrary, I am delighted.' \" 'You are very good. I ought to have said something about the travelling in these wild countries, which is anything but pleasant. The soil is a species of clay, hard as a flint when the weather is dry, nning into a slippery paste as soon as moistened. It is, therefore, very fatiguing, especially in wet weather, when the soldiers slip about, in a very laughable manner to look at, but very distressing to themselves. I travelled either on horseback or in one of the waggons, as it happened. I was too well known, and I hope I may add, too well liked, not to be as well provided possible. It is remarkable how soon a Frenchman will make himself comfort able, wherever he may chance to be. The camp of Mze_ Ammar was as busy and as as if it was pitched in the heart of France. The followers had built up little cabins out of the branches of trees, with their leaves on, interwoven together, all in straight lines, forming streets, very com modious, and perfectly impervious to the"], [160, "A RENCONTRE. 144 withering sun. There were restaurants, cafe's, dibis de vin et eau-de-vie, sausage sellers, butchers, grocers \u2014 in fact, there was every trade almost, and everything you required ; not very cheap certainly, but you must recollect that this little town had sprung up, as if by magic, in the heart of the desert \"'It was in the month of September that Damremont ordered a rtconnoi in the direction of Constantine, and a bat talion of my husband's regiment, the 47th, was ordered to form a part of it. I have said nothing about my husband. He was a good little man, and a brave officer, full of honour, but very obstinate. He never would take advice, and it was nothing but \" Taistoi, Coralie\" all day long \u2014 but no one is perfect. He wished me to remain in the camp, but I made it a rule never to be left behind. We set off, and I rode in one of the little carriages called cacolets, Avhich had been provided for the wounded. It was terrible travelling, I was jolted to atoms in the ascent of the steep mountain called the Rass-el-akba ; but we gained the summit without a shot being fired. When we arrived there, and looked down beneath us, the sight was very picturesque. There were about four or five thousand of the Arab cavalry awaiting our descent ; their \u2022white bournous, as they term the long dresses in which they infold themselves, waving in the wind as they galloped at speed in every direction ; while the glitter \u2022of their steel arms flashed like lightning upon your eyes. We closed our ranks and \u2022descended ; the Arabs, in parties of forty -or fifty, charging upon our flanks every minute, not coming to close conflict, but stopping at pistol-shot distance, discharging their guns and then wheeling off again to a distance \u2014 mere child's play, Sir ; neverthe less there were some of our men wounded, .and the litre v upon which I Tiding was ordered up in the advance to take them in. Unfortunately, to keep clear of the troops, the driver kept too much on one side of the narrow defile through which we passed ; the consequence was, that the waggon upset, and I was Tthrown out a considerable distance down the precipice ' \" ' And broke your nose,' interrupted I. \" ' No, indeed, Sir, I did not. I escaped with only a few contusions about the region \u2022of the hip, which certainly lamed me for some time, and made the jolting more disagreeable than ever. Well, the ricon- succeeded. Damremont was, Hogether. I told him so , but he was an ob old fool, and his answer was not as polite as it might have been, considering that at that time I was a very pretty woman. We returned to the camp at Mzez Ammar; a few days afterwards we were attacked by the Arabs, who showed great spirit and determination in their desultory mode of warfare, which, however, can make no impression on such troops as the French. The attack was continued for three days, when they decamped as suddenly a had come. But this cannot be very in teresting to you, Monsieur.' \" * On the contrary, do not, I beg, leave out a single remark or incident.' \" 'You are very good. I presume you know how we militaires like to fight our battles over again. Well, Sir, we remained in camp until the arrival of the Due de Nemours \u2014 a handsome, fair lad, who smiled upon me very graciously. On the ist of October we set off on our expedition to Constantine ; that is to say, the advanced guard did, of which my husband's com pany formed a portion. The weather, which had been very fine, now changed, and it rained hard all the day. The road was one mass of mud, and there was no end to delays and accidents. Ho , the weather became fine again, and on the 5th we arrived wad gues of Con stantine, when the Arabs attacked us, and I was very nearly taken prisoner.' ' ' ' Indeed ! ' ' ' Yes ; my husband, who, as I before observed to you, was very obstinate, would have me ride on a caisson in the whereas I wished to be in the advance, where my advice might have been useful. The charge of the Arabs was very sudden ; the three men who were with the c.z were sabred, and I was in the arms of a chieftain, who was wheeling round his horse to make off with me when a ball took him in the neck, and he fell with me. I dis engaged myself, seized the horse by the bridle, and prevented its escape ; and I also took possession of the Arab's .pistols and cuneter.' \" ' Indeed !

The next day we arrived before Constnntine, and we had to defile s guns. At one portion of the road, men and horses were tumbled over by their fire ; the caisson that I was riding upon was upset by a ball, and n down the ravine, dragging the horses after it. I lay among the horses' legs \u2014 they kicking furiously; it was a r that my life was preserved : as it was '"], [161, "A RENCONTRE. 145 \" ' You broke your nose,' interrupted I. \" ' No, Sir, indeed I did not. I only received a kick on the arm, which obliged me to carry it in a sling for some days. The weather became very bad ; we had few tents, and they were not able to resist the storms of rain and wind. We wrapped ourselves up how we could and sat in deep of water, and the Arabs attacked us before we could open the fire of our batteries ; we were in such a pickle that, had the bad weather lasted, we must have retreated ; and happy would those have been who could have once more found Wes safe in the camp of Mzez Ammar. I don't think that I ever suf fered so much as I did at that time \u2014 the r had even overcome the natural gallantry of our nation ; and so far from ing any attention, the general re mark to me was, \"What the devil do \u25a0 here? \" This to be said to a woman ! \"It was not till the 10th that we could manage to open the fire of our batteries. It was mud, mud, and mud again ; the men and horses were covered with mud up to their necks \u2014 the feathers of the staff were covered with mud \u2014 every ball which was fired by the enemy sent up showers of mud ; even the face of the Due de irs was disfigured with it. I must at our batteries were well situated, ept the great mortar battery. This I pointed out to Damremont when he passed me, and he was very savage. Great men don't like to be told of their faults ; , er, he lost his life three days after wards from not taking my advice.

The verv reply, when made known to the troops, filled them with admiration of their enemy, and they swore by their colours that if ever they overpowered them they would give them no quarter. \"'In two days. General Vall-ie, to whom the command fell upon the death of Damremont, considered the breach suffi ciently wide for the assault, and we every hour expected that the order would be given. It came at last. My poor husband was in the second column which mounted. Strange to say, he was very melancholy on that morning, and appeared to have a pre sentiment of what was to take place. \" Coralie,\" said he to me, as he was scrap ing the mud off his trousers with his pocket knife, \" if I fall, you \".ill do well. I leave you as a legacy to General Vall_e \u2014 he will appreciate you. Do not forget to let him know my testamentary dispositions.\" \" ' I promised I would not. The drums beat. He kissed me on both cheeks. \"Go, lulippe,\" said I ; \"go to glory.\" He did ; for a mine was sprung, and he with many others was blown to atoms. I had ed the advance of the column, and was able to distinguish the form of my dear Philippe when the explosion with the vast column of smoke took place. When it cleared away, I could see the wounded in every direction hastening back ; but my husband was not among them. In the time the other columns entered the breach \u2014 the firing was awful, and the ;e dreadful. It was more than an hour after the assault commenced before the French tricolour waved upon the minarets of Constantine. \" 'It was not until the next day that I could make up my mind to search for my husband's body ; but it was my duty. I climbed up the breach, strewed with the corpses of our brave soldiers, intermingled with those of the Arabs ; but I could not rind my husband. At last a head which had been blown off attracted my attention. I examined it \u2014 it was my Philippe's, black ened and burnt, and terribly disfigured : .ho can disguise the fragment of a husband from the keen eyes of the wife of his bosom? I leaned over it. \" My poor Philippe!\" exclaimed I; and the tears were bedewing my cheeks when I perceived the Due de Nemours close to me, with all his staff attending him. \" What have we said he, with surprise, to those about him. \" A wife, looking for her husband's body, mon Prince,\" replied I. \"I cannot find it; but here is his head.\" He said something very complimentary and kind, and then walked on.

At last it occurred to me that his testamentary dispositions should be at tended to, and I wrote to General \\ informing him of the last wishes of my husband. His reply was very short ; it was. that he was excessively flattered, but press of business would not permit him to administer to the will. It was not polite. \"'On the 26th I quitted Constantine with a convoy of wounded men. The dysentery and the cholera made fearful ravages, and I very soon had a caisson all to myself. The rain again came on in torrents, and it was a dreadful funeral pro cession. Every minute wretches, jolted to death, were thrown down into pits by the road-side, and the cries of those who sur vived were dreadful. Many died of cold and hunger ; and after three days we arrived at the camp of Mzez Ammar, with the loss of more than one-half of our sufferers. \" ' I took possession of one of the huts built of the boughs of the trees which I formerly described, and had leisure to think over my future plans and prospects. I was young and pretty, and hope did not desert me. I had recovered my baggage, which I had left at the camp, and was now able to attend to my toilet.
