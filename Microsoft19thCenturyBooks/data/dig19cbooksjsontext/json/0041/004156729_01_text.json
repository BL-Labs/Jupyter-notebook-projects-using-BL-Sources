The present Work is executed upon the same Plan, as the Author's two former Volumes of The Topography of England. The favourable reception of Avhich, by the Public, has excited his sincere gratitude. Whilst his experience in Research has greatly diminished the difficulty of his Undertaking. The Kingdom of Great Britain ha\\-ing beeen recently united with Ireland a perfect uniformity with the preceding Volumes is not to be expected, particularly in that kind of information Avhich incidentally arises from Returns ordained by Law, or directed by Government, or either House of Parliament. Of this kind are the Poor Returns of 1803, arising from the legal Provision for the Maintenance of the Poor ; a Policy singular and peculiar to England, and not likely to be imitated elseAvhere, as the most able opinions are not agreed Avhether the benefit is com mensurate Avith the great expense and infinite trouble occasioned by the Poor's Rate ; which, hoAvever, has made the Boundaries of Parishes, and their relati\\7e value, better known in Eugland than, perhaps, in any other Country. Neither has any authentic Inquiry into the Population of Ireland hitherto been instituted, though a Bill to that effect Avas introduced into The House of Commons in February 1806 ; but which was silently abandoned by its Author. In England also the Liber Regis, compiled chiefly rom the Valor of King Henry the Eighth, furnished a mass of Ecclesiastical Information of Avhich the Author fully availed himself. Mr. Seward, in the Appendix to his Topogra phia Hibernica No. VI, has given a Table of the First Fruits of the Ecclesi astical Benefices in Ireland, as taxed in the King's Books, Avhich he states, to have been accurately copied from the Original Record in the Chief Remembrancer's Office, ancl was printed in a Tract, intituled, \"Valor Beneficiorum Ecclesi asticorum in Hibernia,\" which has been used upon the present occasion. In addition to this Valor, Avhich appears to have been compiled between the 29\u00b0 of Henry VIII (1538), and the 5\u00b0 of Charles I (1630), authentic Ecclesiast ical Information of great weight and value has recently been obtained by Government, so that the state of the Church of Ireland is better knoAvn, and consequently better illustrated than that of England in the former Volumes of this Work. i 1"], [16, "via PREFACE. In the month of June 1805, The House of Commons ordered certain Returns to be made from the several Dioceses of Ireland, and these Returns Avere ordered to be printed in February 1806. They are signed by the Registers of the several Dioceses, and contain the names and number of parishes comprised in each Union of Parishes ; the period of time when such parishes Avere united, and the Authority under which such Union was effected ; the number of acres of Glebe which appertain to each parish ; Avhether any Glebe House for the Residence of the Incumbent is erected thereon ; and the distance at which United Parishes lie from each other, Avhen such parishes are not contiguous ; and Avhether any and Avhat number of Churches, in which Divine Service is performed, are noAv sever ally thereon, or Avere at the time when such Parishes were united. .- ___,_- But the spirit of Inquiry, so successfully begun, did not rest here. In a dis patch from Earl Spencer, dated Whitehall, the 18th of June 1806, to His Grace the Lord Lieutenant (then Duke of Bedford), Ave find His Lordship stating, that \" Among all the important subjects which are involved in the Government of that \" part of the United Kingdom 0A*er Avhich Your Grace is appointed by His \" Majesty to preside, there is none on Avhich His Majesty's paternal care for the \" Avelfare of His Subjects leads Him to look with more anxiety than the Present \" State of the Established Church of Ireland, and the obvious necessity of \" adopting, without delay, any proper measure for its Support, and for remedying \" those Evils under Avhich it at present unfortunately labours.\" \" In having recourse to Your Grace on this occasion\", continues the Noble \" Earl, \" I have the greatest satisfaction in knowing that your Habits, Opinions, \"and Disposition, are such as to inspire the fullest confidence of your cordial \" concurrence in promoting these important Objects ; and I flatter myself that \" the mode of proceeding AA'hich, upon the most mature Consideration, it has \" been thought advisable to pursue, Avill ensure to us the zealous Co-operation \" of the very respectable Prelates Avho are noAv placed at the Head of the \" Church of Ireland, at the same time that it affords the most unobjectionable \" as well as effectual means of procuring the Information required. \" With these Views I have His Majesty's Commands to direct Your Grace to \" Avrite to The Lord Primate, and the three other Archbishops of Ireland, desir \" ing that they will, with as little delay as possible, procure in their respective \" Provinces, and transmit to Your Grace, for His Majesty's Information, the most \" accurate Accounts that can be furnished osthe actual Situation osthe Established \" Church of Ireland, more especially on the following important Points: \" The present State of Residence of the Clergy in each Diocese respectively, \" and the means which exist of enforcing it : the Obstacles Avhich may be in the \" Avay of it, by the want of Churches, of Glebe Houses, or otherwise ; and the \" best mode of applying such Funds as noAV are applicable, or may hereafter be \" granted by Parliament for these Purposes :"], [17, "PREFACE. IX \" The number of Livings, in each Diocese, of a Value too small to afford to Re \" sident Incumbents the means of comfortable subsistence : \" The AlloAvance now given to Curates in cases of allo.ved Non-residence of the \" Incumbent, and the number of Curates Avho may be resident or non-resident \" upon their Cures : \" The State of the Unions of parishes * the number and extent of each Union; \" the authority by Avhich they Avere made ; and the propriety of their being re \" spectively continued or dissolved. \u2014 The Regulations which it may be proper to \" establish by Law or otherwise on this subject, both to prevent any Union being \" henceforth improperly made, and to preserve the Churches and Glebe Houses \" from dilapidation, Avhere there are more than one in the united parishes ; \u2014 and, \" generally, all such other matters of information as may suggest themselves to \" Your Grace, or as may occur to the Archbishops themselves, as likely to be use \" fui toAvards enabling His Majesty to give effect to His benevolent and paternal \" intentions for the protection and support of the Established Church of that \" part of the United Kingdom.\" In consequence of these instructions, the Lord Lieutenant addressed a Circular Letter, dated the 16th of July 1806, to the several Archbishops of Armagh, Dub lin, Cashel, and Tuam, communicating to them the foregoing dispatch, and ex pressing his fullest reliance on their earnest assistance and zealous co-operation in forwarding the King's intentions ; And, at the same time, subjoining a List of Queries a to be submitted to the several Bishops within each Province. a As these Queries are so excellent, and exemplary, the author has been induced to subjoin them in the following note. \" Queries To be addressed by the several Archbishops of Ireland, to the Bishops in their respective Provinces. or would any other distribution of the parishes, com prehended within any Union, be expedient?

Should such Unions be continued or dissolved ? b"], [18, "K PREFACE. Upon the Answers to these Questions, Avhich were ordered to be printed by The House of Commons on the 29th of July 1807, and Avhich contain many valua ble remarks, This Topographical Dictionary of Ireland rests its principal claim to the attention of the Public. The enlightened Eart avIio first moved the inquiry, and the Reverend Prelates who so attentively promoted his intentions, have merited the warmest gratitude of their Country. It has long been the mis fortune of Ireland to be little known: But from henceforth, let no one complain osthe Avant of intelligence concerning The Established Church. The approbation of an humble individual may be of no moment, but the Author hesitates not to avow this to be, in his limited capacity, one osthe most satisfactory and valuable Reports Avhich has ever been laid before The United Parliament. Of the publications Avhich have preceded the present Work, in illustrating the Topography of Ireland, the first in order is, \" The Post-Chaise Companion*: Or, Traveller's Directory through Ireland. Dublin 1786. 8vo.\" This Book Avas printed by Mr. Wilson, and usually goes under his name. At page 5, of the Introduction, this description of the roads of Ireland is stated to be upon a 4. AVhat cause is there for the non-residence of such as do not reside ? 2. What are the powers which now exist, of en forcing residence, or which it may be necessary to recommend to the legislature to provide for that pur pose ? 5. By whom are the duties discharged? 6. Is there any Glebe House within the Benefice ? 7. In what parish is the Glebe House situated ? VI. 8. AVhat Glebe Lands belong to the Benefice ? p. Are they contiguous to, or, how far removed What is the best mode of applying such funds as are now applicable, or hereafter may become so, to the purpose of building or reparing of Churches or Glebe Houses, or the improvement of Glebes or otherwise ? from each other ? 10.

IV. What is the allowance now given to Curates in case of permitted non-residence of the Incumbent ; and the number of Curates, resident or non-resident, upon their Cures ? VIII.

XI plan similar to Mr. Patterson's useful Book of the English Roads ; with this very material advantage, that descriptions of ToAvns are given, together Avith accounts of the most remarkable Buildings, Antiquities, modern Improvements, natural Productions, and many other particulars Avorthy the Traveller's attention. The actual Surveys by Messrs. Taylor and Skinner are also said to have been used, and many other Avell authenticated documents. Sir Richard Colte Hoare in his expressive language says, this \" is the best lter I ever saAv.\" And it is worthy of remark, that the late Mr. Gough has incorporated almost the Avhole of this book in his edition of Camden's Britannia, 1789. In the year 1789, was published \" The Hibernian Gazetteer; being a De scription of the several Provinces, Counties, Cities, Post and Fair Toavns, Alphabetically arranged; avith a concise Historical and Geo graphical Account of Ireland. The whole collected from the best Authorities and most accurate Observations. By William Wenman Seavard, Esq. Dublin. 1789- 12mo.\" The Author in his Preface says, \" the nature of the present Undertaking at once evinces its utility. It was intended to give a concise view of the State of this Kingdom, and its Antiquities, in a manner both pleasing and instructive.\" After a Avell turned compliment to the merit of the writings of the late Charles Smith, M. D., Mr. SeAvard concludes his Preface with an extract from some important queries, Avhich Dr. Smith recommends to the curious, to enable them to make proper inquiries into the Natural and Civil State of their respective Neighbourhoods. In this publication, Mr. Seward has thrown into an Alphabetical form the Descriptions, contained in Wilson's Post-Chaise Companion, prefixing an Historical Introduction. The design being laudable, it appears to have met Avith suitable encouragement. And, in the year 1797, we find the same Gentleman publishing under an improved form, \" Topographia Hibernica; or, The Topography of Ire land, Ancient, and Modern. Giving a complete View of the Civil and Ecclesiastical State of that Kingdom. Dublin, 1797, 4to.\" In this edition, Mr. SeAvard has availed himself of the labours of The Rev. Mr. Archdall, and more especially of The Rev. Dr. Beaufort, who, in 1792, published his \" Memoir of a Map of Ireland;\" which, under this modest title, contains n succinct account of the Civil and Ecclesiastical State of Ireland, and an Index of all tbe Places Avhich appear on his Map. The careful Research exemplified in the Construction and Explanation of this truly Original Map are generally known. But, it would be unpardonable in the Author, who has compared Dr. Beaufort Avith the more recent Ecclesiastical Au thorities, not publicly to bear testimony of his Accuracy of Investigation, in collect ing materials for a Book, which is an Ornament to Ireland. In the present Work, the subjects are arranged in the same order as in the Topo-"], [20, "Xli PREFACE. graphy of England ; Avith such unavoidable omissions, as have been explained in the beginning of this Preface. The Orthography of the names of parishes has been determined by a careful comparison osthe Diocesan Returns, Dr. Beaufort's Memoir, and other Topogra phical Books. As the Reader may require an explanation of that part of the Work whiph relates to the Provinces, it is proper to mention, that Ireland is divided, Avith respect to its Civil or Politica.1 distinctions into the Four Provinces of Ulster, Leinster, Connaught, and Munster; Avhich are subdived into Thirty-two Counties, in the following manner.- \u2014 The Province of Ulster comprises the nine Northern Counties, being those of Antrim, Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry, Monaghan, and Tyrone. Together with the great body of Water, Lough Neagh, which, according to Dr. Beaufort, covers 58,200 acres. The Province of Leinster comprises the twelve Eastern Counties, being* Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, King's County, Longford, Louth, Meath, Queen's County, West Meath, Wexford, and Wicklow. The Province of Connaught comprises the five Western Counties, beino* G al way, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo. The Province of Munster comprises the six Southern Counties, beino- Clare Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford. With respect to its Church Establishment, Ireland is divided into the four Provinces of Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam. An Archbishop presides OArer each. These Provinces are subdivided into Thirty-tAvo Dioceses Avhich are united or consolidated under eighteen Bishops, in the following order. The Archbishop of Armagh, avIio is Lord Primate, and Metropolitan of all Ireland, presides over the eight Suffragan Bishops of Ardagh, Cloo-her Derry, Down and Connor, Dromore, Kilmore, Meath, b ancl Raphoe, in the Northern Province. The Archbishop of Dublin, who is Lord Primate of Ireland, presides over the three Suffragan Bishops of Kildare, Leighlin and Ferns, and Ossory, in the Eastern Province. The Archbishop of Cashel, avIio is Lord Primate of Munster, presides over the five Suffragan Bishops of Cloyne,Cork_.>ztf Ross, Killaloe and Kilfenora, Limerick and Ardfert and Aghadoe, and Waterford and Lismore, in the Southern Province. The Archbishop of Tuam, who is Lord Primate of Connaught, presides over the three Suffragan Bishops of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, Elphin, and Killala and Achonry in the Western Province. b The Bishop of Meath has piccedence of all Bishop., and next to him The Bishop of Kildare. The other Bishops take place according to the date of their Consecration. ."], [21, "PREFACE. xm Tlie number of Deanries in this Kingdom is Thirty-three, and of Archdeaconries Thirty-four. But the Archdeacons, according to Dr. Beaufort, have not a Visita torial jurisdiction ; the Government of the Church of Ireland, which is in most tilings conformable to that of England, differing Avith respect to Visitations : For in Ireland, the Bishops hold a Visitation annually, and the Archbishop visits his Suffragans every third year. When the Province, therefore, is mentioned, in Succession to the County, it is to be understood with reference to the Civil Jurisdiction. And, on the other hand, when the Province is noticed, in its order with the Diocese, it applies to the Established Church. The Distances and Bearings osthe several parishes are given from their nearest Post-Office towns, which are all set from the City of Dublin. The distances from thence are according to the Post-Office account. In all cases, Avhere distance is expressed, the scale of Irish miles has been used, in 'conformity with the Road Books. And, in all the Cross roads (as observed in the Preface to the former Volumes), the direct distance has been measured on the Map from the nearest Post-Office toAvn to the place in question, and to that distance, one seventh part more has been added ; except in mountainous or marshy counties, Avhen a greater proportion has occasionally been allowed. For the information of strangers, it may also be proper to remark, that eleven Irish Miles are equal to fourteen English Miles. A considerable alteration having taken place in the state of the Representation of Ireland on the Union in 1801, the following Extract, Avith the hope of its being found useful, is copied from \" An Act to regulate the Mode by avhich the \" Lords Spiritual andTemporal, and the Commons, to serve in the Par \" liament of the united klngdom on the part of ireland, shall be *' summoned and returned to the said parliament. whereas it is \" agreed by the Fourth Article of Union, That Four Lords Spiritual of Ireland, by \" Rotation of Sessions, and Twenty-eight Lords Temporal of Ireland, elected for \" Life by the Peers of Ireland, shall be the Number to sit and vote on the Part of '.'.

This priory was in hiffh estimation, on account of numerous miracles which were said to have been wrought there. The ruins of this noble structure stand a little to the East of the town ; the walls of the Steeple, the Choir with some of the Cloisters, the Dormi tory, and the Chapel for Morning Prayer, remain entire. In the church is a fine figure of St. Brandon, in alto relief; adjoining was a Round tower 120 feet in height, and esteemed the finest in Ireland; but being neglected, it unfortunately fell to the ground in the year 177.1.\" \u2014 ArchdaWs Monast.

This monastery was in such high repute, that a general Chapter of the Order was holden in it, in the year 1510. At the suppression of Religious houses, this monastery and its possessions were granted to Sir Edmund Fitzgerald, who assigned the same to Sir Arthur Chichester, ancestor to the Earl of Donegal.

Of the great Baronial Estates, attached to this Castle, it may not be improper briefly to mention, that Sir Theobald Bourke, the Fourth Viscount of Mayo, being left a Minor, preferred a petition, upon his father's death and forfeiture, to the Commissioners of Government for a maintenance : Who declared, on the 15th of April, 1653, that if he would repair to Dublin, and make application to them, they would take care that he should be decently educated, and maintained. He repaired to Dublin accordingly, and was placed under the tuition of Mr. John Stephens, then Master of the Free School. Some time after which, he wras sent for to Eng land by his mothers relations, with whom he lived till the Restoration of the King.

According to the Ecclesiastical Report, \" many new arrangements of parishes, highly advan tageous and conducive to the establishment osthe Protestant Church, might ob viously be made in the Diocese of Clonfert, were the Government to extend to it"], [207, "CLO the same policy under which it has been pleased at different periods to regulate, I believe, every other Diocese in Ireland : namely, to enable the Bishop, by grant ing him a compensation, to restore the Quarta Pars (or, certain portions of Tythe due out of different parishes), or rather grant them (all Tythes being originally the property of the Diocesan) to the officiating Parochial Incumbents. Of such a measure, the first result would be to release the Diocesan from the necessity of employing a Tythe Proctor ; or, as it happens in some cases, where the Incum bent wishes to become tenant to the Quarta Pars, from trafficking with one of his clergy for a property not unimportant to either. In the hands of the Incum bent, these portions would individually increase much in value: their dispartition would lay a reasonable foundation for the dissolution of several of the present Unions: new churches and additional Incumbents might follow ; a competenc*y would be established for general residence, and a single Manse House would no' longer remain the opprobrium of the union of two not inconsiderable Sees. In the instance of three Benefices, viz., Clonfert, Donanaghta, and Kiltormer, I have the best authority to assert that these three Benefices would afford equal, if not superior incomes to six Clergymen : and three additional churches might be built in situations not remote from any church, if the respective native tythes of each parish were relinquished by the Diocesan, and conferred upon the Incum bent. In respect to the parish of Clonfert, upon any dissolution of the Union, I conceive it might be ad viseable to constitute it part of the Corps of the Deanery of Clonfert, which Dignitary is at present without cure of souls, in order to induce the Dean to reside at Clonfert : where, from the solitude of the situation, and un civilization osthe lower orders of people, such an association to the residence of the Ordinary might prove very beneficial to the cause of religion and morality.\" How sensible, and judicious!

The Bishoprick of Clonfert (valued in the King's Books at \u00a324. sterling) was founded, according to Dr. Beaufort, near the close osthe Sixth century; and the See of Kilmacduagh, in the beginning osthe Seventh.

In the old Dio- cese of Clonmacknois, united to Meath in the year 1568, there is a Dean. (The Rev. Thomas V. Dawson, A.M., in 1806), but no other Dignitary or Prebendary. \u2014 \"This monastery, which belonged to the Regular Canons of St. Augustin, was peculiarly and universally esteemed, it was uncommonly extensive, and amazingly enriched by various Kings and Princes. Its landed property was so great, and the number of cells and monasteries subjected to it so numerous, that almost half of Ireland was said to be within the bounds of Clonmacnoise. And what was a strong inducement, and contributed much towards enriching this house, it was believed, that all persons who were interred in the holy ground belonging to iit, had insured to themselves a sure ancl immediate ascent to Heaven; many princes (it is supposed for this reason) chose this for the place of their sepulture; it was the Jona of Ireland. Yet notwithstanding the reputed sanctity of this monastery, and the high estimation in which it was holden by all ranks of people, it appears, that the abbey and town were frequently plundered, burnt and destroyed by de- spoilers of every kind, from the unpolished Irish desperado, to the empurpled King. The abbey also suffered by the hands of the barbarous Ostmen, and not only by them, but (with concern do we add) by the English then settled in the kingdom, whose errand hither, we would wish to think, was to conciliate the affections of the people, to unite them in bonds of friendship, and teach them to live like fellow citizens and subjects; instead of this, we are compelled to say, they too often joined in the sacrilegious outrages of other wicked men, and re- peatedly disturbed and despoiled the peaceful seminary of Clonmacnoise; sparing neither book, vestment, or any other appendage of the sacred altar, which be- longed to these truly inoffensive men. The situation of Clonmacnoise is delight- ful. It stands about ten miles from Athlone, on the banks osthe Shannon, and is raised above the river on ground composed of many small elevations, on which are a few of the buildings which did belong to this ancient house. Several other ruins appertaining to it may also be seen in the little vallies between the hills. The whole is bounded to the East and North with very large bogs. Here are two Round towers, elegantly built of hewn stone; the larger, which is called O'Rourk's, and wants the roof, is 62 feet in height, and 56 in circumference, and the walls are three feet eight inches in thickness. The other Tower, called Mac Carthy's, is seven feet in diameter within, and the walls are three in thickness, and 56 in height, including the conical shaped roof. The next considerable building we find here, is the Cathedral, which was the ancient abbey (founded, in the year 548, by St. Kieran) the doors of it are richly carved. There are several old monuments in this church, on which are inscriptions, said to be partly in Hebrew and partly in Irish. At length this abbey, which was formerly endowed with very large"], [212, "CLO possessions, suffered a gradual decline, and iu the course of time was reduced and despoiled of all its property. The cemetery contained about two Irish acres, on which ten other churches were afterwards built by tbe Kings and petty Princes of the circumjacent country, who, though at perpetual war whilst living, were con tent to rest peaceably beside each other. The several founders named these churches as follows: Temple Righ, or Melaghlin's Church, built by O'Melaghlin, King of Meath, and to this day it is the burial-place of that family ; Temple O'Con nor, built by O'Connor Dun ; Temple Kelly ; Temple Finian, or Mac Car thy, built by Mac Carthy-more of Munster; Temple Hurpan, or Mac Laffys Church; Temple Kieran ; Temple Gauney ; Temple Doulin, which is now the parish church ; and Temple Mac Dermot ; this last was much larger than any of the others, and before the West door stands a large old cross of one entire stone, much defaced by time, on which was some rude carving, and an inscription in antique and un known characters : the North doors are very low, but guarded with small pillars of fine marble, curiously hewn. Another of these churches hath within it an arch of greenish marble, flat wrought, and beautifully executed, the joints of which are so close, that the whole appears to be of one entire stone. Besides the cross before mentioned, there are three others in the church-yard. Here we also find Temple Easpic, or The Bishop's Chapel, and on the West of the cemetery lie some ruins of the Episcopal Palace, which may still be seen. The 9th of September is annually observed as the patron day, when great numbers from the most distant parts of Ireland, assemble here in pilgrimage.

For such a masterly defence of his ship, and against such a Arery unequal force, it was \" Resolved, at a Court of Directors held on Thursday the 10th of June 1779, that in consideration osthe gallant defence made by the Officers and Seamen osthe ship Bridge water, against an American Ship of War of superior force, which after an engagement of some hours Avas obliged to sheer off, a gratuity of Two thousand pounds, be paid to the said Officers and Seamen, in such proportion as shall be settled by the Com mittee of shipping.

Some people have given the invention of this purgatory to the great St. Patrick, but others, Avith more proba bility, ascribe it to Patrick who was Prior here about the year 850. This pur gatory continued a long time in high repute both at home and abroad. We find, in our records, several safe conducts granted by the Kings of England to for eigners desirous to visit it, ancl particularly in the year 1358, to Maletesta Un garus, Knt. ; another bearing the same date, to Nicholas de Beccario, a Nobleman of Ferr^iria; and, in 1397, one to Raymond, Viscount de Perilleux ancl Knight of Rhodes, with a train of 20 Men ancl 30 Horses. But this purgatory must haA*e fallen afteiAvards into disrepute, for we find, that by the authority of the Pope, Alexander VI (he having considered the same in the light of imposition), it was demolished on St. Patrick's Day, in the the year 1497, by the Father Guardian of the Franciscans of Donegal, and some other persons of the Deanery of Lough cm, who were deputed for this purpose by the Bishop. A Canon of the priory of St. Dabeoc usually resided on the Island, for the service of the church and pil grims. \u2014 The extent of this island is scarcely three quarters of an Irish acre; the Cave of tbe purgatory is built of free-stone, and covered Avith broad fla\u00b0s and green turf laid over them ; in length, Avithin the walls, it measures sixteen feet and an half, aud in breadth, about two feet and an inch ; Avhen the door is shut no light can be discovered, save Avhat enters at a small window in the corner.

This City returns two Members to Parliament ; the Electors being, Freemen and Freeholders. TheUNivERSiTY, being a Borough in itself, returns also one Member; the Election being in, The Fellows and Scholars. It is called Eblana Civitas by Ptolomey. According to Dr. Beaufort, it is impossible to give even an adequate Sketch of the"], [298, "DUB City of Dublin in a short tract; but it Avould be unpardonable to omit some of its principal features. It extends above two miles in every direction, and is rapidly increasing in size, opulence, and beauty. The River Liffey, which passes through its centre, is crossed by six Bridges, one of Avhich is of great elegance. The Harbour is defended from the inclemency of the winds and waves by a strong mole or wall, extending nearly four miles in length, and terminating with a Light-house, Avhich is erected about a mile from the Eastern ancl adjacent to the Southern bar. Corresponding to this handsome ancl useful Pharos, there stands on the Promontory of Hoath, which forms the North side of the Bay, another very complete Light-house. The vast number of country-houses, and neat villages, which cover the shores of the Bay, the varied and undulating summits of the WickloAV Mountains in the southern back-ground, and the prospect of the City at the WTest end, compose one of the grandest scenes that can be imagined. Of the many Public Edifices that adorn it, the most remarkable are,\u2014 The Castle, which stands nearly in the middle of the city, and is the residence of the Vice roy,\u2014The Parliament-House;\u2014 The University,\u2014 The Royal Exchange,\u2014 and The Custom-House ;_all buildings of great magnificence. The Courts of Justice are almost finished in the same style,\u2014 The Linen Hall,\u2014 The Bar racks,\u2014 Hospitals for Invalids,\u2014 for the children of sailors and of soldiers, for the education of youth, and for the reception of the aged and infirm of various descriptions\u2014 are too numerous to mention separately. The Royal Irish Academy Avas incorporated in 1786. The Dublin Society, for the improvement of agriculture and useful arts, which Avas incorporated so early as the year 1749, has truly ans.vered the end of its institution, by promoting objects of the utmost importance to Ireland. Two Canals are begun on the opposite sides of the river, Avith Avhich they are immediately to communicate. The Southern Navigation extends up .vards of forty miles, to the River Barroxv, which is navigable ; and a branch of this canal is carried on in a Avestern direction toAvards the Shannon. The Northern Canal has also communication Avith that great River in the County of Longford, and, by a collateral Cut unites with the Boyne navigation. To the West end of the toAvn adjoins The Ph\u0153nix Park, a Royal Demesne of great beauty, Avhich extends above two miles in length, and a mile ancl an half in breadth, on the North side of the Liffey. The Corporation of this City consists of a Lord Mayor, Recorder, 24 Aldermen (all of whom are Justices of the Peace), two Sheriffs, a Common Council, and other Officers. It is almost needless to say, that most branches of commerce and every kind of trade are exercised in Dublin, and that the city is daily advancing in Avealth and industry. The first mention, which Ave find of the See of Dublin, is in the Seventh century. In the year 1152 it Avas erected into an Archbishoprick, which is valued in the King's Books at .\u00a3534.15. .2f Irish Money : Ancl, in 1214, the Bishoprick of Glandelagh, which had been founded in the Sixth Gentury, was incorporated Avith Dublin. It is 50"], [299, "BUB miles in length, from North to South, and 36 miles in the greatest breadth ; con- taining the whole county of Dublin, the most of Wicklow, and part of tAvo other counties. The Chapter of St. Patrick's, Dublin, consists of the Dean (who is elective by the Archbishop and Chapter), the Precentor, Chancellor, Treasurer, two Archdeacons, of Dublin ancl Glandelagh, and nineteen Prebendaries. The Members of the Collegiate Chapter of Christ Church are the Dean, Precentor, Chancellor, Treasurer, the Archdeacon of Dublin, and three Prebendaries : This Deanery is annexed to the Bishoprick of Kildare. The Cathedral of St. Patrick is a large and venerable Pile ; and the Archbishop's Palace is a very antique building. His Grace has also a small Country Residence at Tallagh, of no very modern date. The most remote part of the Diocese is thirty four miles from Dublin. The General Post-office Avas established by Act of Parliament, on the 1st of August 1 784 : The present Post-Masters General (in 181 0) are The Right Hon. Earl O'Neil, and The Right Hon, the Earl of Ross : The Secretaries are Sir John Lees, Bart., ancl Edward S. Lees, Esq. There are six Packets between Dublin and Holyhead; and two Packet Wherries. The Mails for England leave Dublin every evening, except Sunday, and are due in Dublin every day, except Wednesday. \u2014 \" The celebrated Religious Foundation osthe Abbey osthe Virgin Mary owes its origin to the Danes, about tbe year 948, immediately after their conversion to Christianity; although others fondly ascribe it to some of our Irish princes. At the first it was of the Benedictine Order, then the most celebrated in the Western Avorld. In 1 139, it was granted to the Monks osthe Cistertian order. On the 27th of May, 1304, this beautiful and noble abbey, with the church and steeple, Avere destroyed by sire : At this time it Avas the Repository of the Rolls of Chancery, which Avere all consumed, to the 28th of King Edward the First, except tAvo Rolls of that year. The Abbot had a Seat in Parliament as a Baron.\u2014 By the testimony of a venerable Record, The Black Book of Christ Church, Ave are informed, that about the year of Our Lord 1038, Sitric, the son of Ableb, or rather Aulif, tbe Danish Prince of Dublin, gave to Donat, Bishop of that See, a place, Avhere the Arches or Vaults Avere founded, to erect a Church to the honour of The Blessed Trinity. Donat built an Episcopal Palace contiguous to the church. The Religious of this Community were Secular Canons, not tied to the observance of strict monastic rules, or belonging to any of the Cenobitical Orders : yet they were a sort of Monks lax in discipline, and bound to such regulations as the Bishop prescribed. On the advancement of Laurence O'Toole to the See of Dublin, in A. D. 1163, he made them Canons Regular of the Order of Arras, a branch osthe Augustinians. On the llth of January 1283, certain of the Scotch Nation, to retaliate upon some of the citizens for doing them an injury, set Skinner-Row on fire, which communicating to this church, destroyed the steeple and chapter-house, with the dormitory ancl cloisters. It is recorded, to the honour of the citizens on this occasion, that they agreed to make a collection"], [300, "D U & sufficient for repairing the priory, before they Avould repair their own dwellings which had suffered by the fire. In the year 1300, a final and amicable agreement Avas made between the Prior and Canons of The Holy Trinity and the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Avhich was strengthened by the Com mon Seal of each Chapter. The principal heads of it Were, That the Arch bishop should be consecrated and enthroned in Christ Church; that each church should be called Cathedral and Metropolitical ; that Christ Church as being the greater, the mother, and the elder church, should have the precedence m aU rights and concerns of the church ; that the cross, mitre, and ring of every Archbishop, in whatever place he died, should be deposited in Christ Church; and that each church should have their turn in the interment of the bodies of their Archbishop, unless otherwise ordered by their wills. In 1538, St. Patrick's Staff, that was brought hither from Armagh, as a relique of high estimation, Avas publicly com mitted to the flames. The Prior of the Holy Trinity always sat as a Baron in Parliament. In 1541, King Henry the Eighth, by Letters Patent, dated the 10th of May, changed the Priory into a Dean and. Chap ter, confirming their ancient estates and immunities, and made Payneswick, Avho Avas the last Prior, the first Dean ; but it is to be remarked, that in some leases of lands, dated the 4th of De cember 1540, he is named Dean.\u2014 In the year 1146, Dermot, the son of Murchard, King of Leinster, founded an Abbey, for Nuns following the Rule of St. Augustin, in a village called Hogges, adjoining the East end of the City of Dublin, and near the present church of St. Andrew. No women Avere admitted into this house, till they Avere past the age of thirty years. \u2014 It is supposed, that the Knights Templars bad a Priory in a place, called Casgot, in the South suburbs of the city ; and that Walter de Fernsfield Avas a great benefactor to it. Probably this is the place, Avhere noAv stands the palace of the Archbishop, in St. KeA'in's Street. \u2014 The Nunnery of St. Mary les Dames Avas situated Avithout the East gate of the city, Avhich from thence was called, The Gate of St. Mary les Dames, and the avenue leading from the Castle to the University acquired the name of Dame Street. In 1487, the person, called Lambert Simnell, being supported by divers of the Nobility, was croAvned King in the Priory of The Holy Trinity, by the name of Edward; the croAvn made use of, on this occasion, Avas borroAved from the statue of the Blessed Virgin, which stood in the church of this Nunnery. \u2014 King Henry the Second having granted the City of Dublin to a Colony from Bristol, they built the Abbey of St. Olave for such of their countrymen as should be inclined to embrace the order of St. Augustin, and called it from the abbey of the same order and name in their native toAvn.\u2014 Very little is known of the monastery of Witeschan.\u2014 The Priory of All Hallows, or All Saints, was situated on Hoggin-Green, now called College-Green, and Avas founded about the year 1 166, for Canons osthe Order of Aroasia, by Diarmit, the son of Murchard, King of Leinster. In 1590, in Easter Holy days, the city, at the persuasion of"], [301, "J) U L Archbishop Loftus, granted the priory for the founding of an University ; and the whole building, the steeple excepted, Avas for that purpose immediately demolished. \u2014 The Abbey of St. Thomas was founded in that part of Dublin, now called Thomas Court, for Canons of the Congregation of St. Victor, by William Fitz Andelm, butler to King Henry the Second. \u2014 The Priory of St. John the Baptist was situated in St. Thomas Street, Avithout the West, or the NeAV Gate, of the city. A Roman Catholic Chapel is erected on part of the site of this Priory ; the ancient steeple still remains.\u2014 The Friary of St. Saviour, in OstmantOAvn, on the North bank of the River, near the old bridge, is now called The King's Inns. It was founded near the great bridge (on tbe place where stood the Chapel of St. Saviour), between the years 1202 and 1218, by William Mareschal the elder, Earl of Pembroke. The whole site Avas afterwards appropriated to the use osthe laAvyers, ancl is called The King's Inns, where a magnificent building is erected, which contains the Courts of Law, tbe Rolls, and all the other Public offices ap- pertaining thereto. \u2014 The Monastery of St, Francis Avas built in the year 1235, upon a piece of ground given for that purpose by Ralph le Porter, and was situated in that part of the suburbs of the city, which is now called Francis Street.\u2014 The Monastery of The Holy Trinity Avas founded about the year 1259, for Friars of the Order of St. Augustin, by one osthe family of Talbot. It Avasa very consid- erable foundation, and Avas the general College for all the Friars of that Order in Ireland. This monastery was situated on the ground Avhereon Crow Street, with a Theatre and other buildings, have been since erected \u2014 TheCarmelite Monastery, or White Friars, was built by Sir Robert Bagot, Knt., Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in the reign of King Edward the First, in the parish of St. Peter, in the South suburbs osthe city.\u2014 Very little mention is made osthe Hospital of St. Stephen, Avhich Avas situate in the South suburbs of the city; and on the site whereof Mercer's Charitable Hospital has been erected.\u2014 Henry Loundres, Arch bishop of Dublin, about the year 1220, founded an Hospital, in honour of God and St. James, in a place, called The Steyne, near the city of Dublin.\u2014 John Allen, Dean of the Cathedral of St. Patrick, in 1504, founded an Hospital for sick poor, to be chosen principally out of the families of Allen, Barret, Begge, Hill, Dillon, and Rodier, in the Dioceses of Meath and Dublin.\"\u2014 ArchdaWs Monast.

Richard Pocock,"], [351, "G I A LL. D., to The Royal Society of London, and inserted in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. 48. part 1. pp. 226. et seq. \u2014 \" In a Letter, Avhich I Avrote in 1747 to Martin Folkes, Esq., President of The Royal Society, which Avas read in January, ancl printed in the Philosophical Transactions for that month, I observed, in relation to the Giant's Causeway, that there appeared in the Sea-Cliffs three strata of Pillars betAveen 30 and 40 feet high, Avith strata of a black Rock betAveen them ; that the CauseAvay itself was the lowest of all these, extending in a point into the sea; and that another is seen towards the top of the Cliff. Last summer I took another vieAv of it ; I went from Bally- Castle, which is about 10 miles to the East of the CauseAvay. When I came two miles to the West of Bally-Castle, Avithin less than a mile of Ballintoy, half a mile to the South of the Sea-cliffs, and about a quarter to the South of the road, I saw the same kind of Pillars in a low hill ; I observed both Hexagons and Pentagons. The Rocks towards the sea appeared as if they were formed in the same manner ; but Avhen I came to them, I found it Avas only common rock in several strata, and perpendicular joints. I Avent on about two miles to a Peninsula, called Don- severik, Avhere I saw some tendency in the rock toAvards this Avork of nature; and going about half a mile further, came to the beginning of the pillars in the Sea-cliff, as I believe, about five miles from the Causeway; and the shore ancl cliffs being shaped mostly in little semicircular Bays, I had many very beautiful views of the upper and middle strata of Pillars : in one, particularly, they had much of the ap- pearance of ruined Portico's one over the other; and turning the little end ofa Spy- glass, it appeared something like the ruins of Palmyra, as a View of them is repre- sented in a Copper-plate, published in the Philosophical Transactions. This won- derful Avork of nature is continued on in the cliffs for about a quarter of a mile beyond the Giant's Causeway.

The Pillars here are small ; and being about a mile and a half from Ballimagarry, Avhere the Earl of Antrim has a ruined house, lately burnt cIoavii, it served, as I suppose, for a Quarry for building part of that house in Avhich I saw a great number of the stones, and particularly one of nine sides. I saw others near two miles farther, to the South of the road in a low hill, within two miles of Coleraine ; so that the Avhole extends for about eleven Irish miles, or fourteen English. \u2014 As I spent a Aveek at the Causeway, and sent aAvay by sea to Dublin as great a variety of the stones as I could conveniently get, particularly a large octagon, Avith the eight large stones round it ; a pair of less, Avith eight pair, that encompass it ; two small pentagon pillars, about fourteen inches over, one of them 3 feet 10\u00a3 inches high, the other 5 feet 7 inches ; one hexagon pillar, about the same size, and 5 feet 5 inches high ; all which I have placed in my garden ; so I have had an opportunity of considering it at leisure.

The Archbishops of Dublin could not obtain quiet possession till 1479> in Avhich year, on the 30th of May, a surrender Avas made in the Cathedral of St. Patrick, Dublin, by Friar Dennis White, Avho had long usurped that See, in opposition to the Regal authority : From this \u00e6ra, Glandelagh has continued a desert: here the Mountains cast a melan choly gloom on the inferior valley, contracting every prospect ; and so awful, so venerable is the scene, that, even to a momentary beholder, it appears as if formed for the study of the Eremetic life: Such was the situation chosen by St. Coemgene, or Keivin, who, descended from a Noble family, was born, A. D. 498 ; this Saint received the Sacrament of Baptism from the hands of St. Cronan, a priest, and at the age of seven years he Avas placed under the care and tuition of Petrocus, a Briton, who had passed many years in this kingdom for the exercise of learning. Under this Reverend man St. Keivin continued till 510, when his parents, Coinlogb and Coemhella, sent him to the cell of Dogain, Lochan, and \u00c6neas or Enna, three holy Anachorites, with Avhom he studied a considerable time, previous to his embracing the Monastic profession ; after which he took upon him the cowl and retired to these Wilds, Avhere he Avrote many learned Avorks, particularly the life of St. Patrick, ancl Avhere, he founded his Abbey, under the InA'ocation of St. Peter and St. Paul : Here he presided as Abbot and Bishop for a series of years, on the approach of death he received the sacrament from the hands of St. Mochuorog, and died on the 3d of June, A. D. 618, having nearly completed the uncommon and venerable age of one hundred and tAventy years. His eminent virtues, his exemplary sanctity, and the miracles said to have been Avrought by the Saint, drew multitudes from toAvns and cities, from ease and affluence, from the cares and avocations of civil life, and from the comforts and joys of society, to be spec tators of his pious acts and sharers in his merits, and, with him, to encounter every severity of climate and condition: This influence extended even to Britain, ancl induced St. Mochuorog to convey himself hither, who fixed his Residence in a Cell on the East side of Glendalogh, Avhere a city soon sprang up, and a seminary was founded, from whence Avere sent forth many saints and exemplary men, whose sanctity and learning diffused around the Western world that universal light of letters and religion, which, in the earlier ages, shone so resplendent throughout"], [354, "G L A this remote, and, at that time, tranquil Isle, and were almost exclusively confined to it. On the 3d of June, annually, numbers of every sex and age flock to the Seven Churches, ancl there celebrate the Festival of the esteemed and venerated St. Keivin. The ruins of this abbey (being the first which a traveller perceives) ' are situated in the bottom of the vale, and consist of two buildings parallel to each other (the larger one, on the South, being the church) ; on the East end of the abbey is an arch, of extremely curious workmanship ; the columns on the sides recede one behind another, and are very short, but do not diminish : the capitals are ornamented in a singular manner, most of them Avith human heads at the ana-les, and dragons or other fabulous ' animals at the sides; the heads have much the appearance of those in Egyptian sculpture, Avith large ears, long eyes, and the tresses of the hair strait ; the ring-stones of the arch are indented trian- gularly, in imitation of tbe Saxon architecture, and in some parts human heads and other ornaments are Avithin the triangular mouldings. On the removal of some heaps of rubbish from under the ruins of this arch, a few stones beautifully carved were found, many of them belonging to the arches, and some to the archi- trave of the AvindoAV : the architrave is twelve inches broad, and a pannel is sunk, ornamented lozengc-Avise, and an ovelo forms the lozenge, with a bead running* on each side ; the centre of the lozenge is decorated on one side, in bas relief, Avifh a knot delicately carved; the other Avith a flower in the centre, and mould- ings corresponding to the shape of the lozenge. The half-lozenge, at the bottom of the pilaster, in one is silled Avith a bas relief of a human head, Avith a bird on each side pecking at the eye, and the other by a dragon, tAvisting its head round and the tail turned up betAveen its legs into the mouth. Here is another stone, apparently the capital of a column; two sides of it are visible, both are ornamented Avith a patera, but each side iu a different manner; one consists of a floAver of sixteen large leaA-es and fifteen smaller ones, relieved the eighth of an inch, and the other of six leaves branching from the centre, with another leaf extending between their points. \u2014 In describing the other ruins of this desolated city (which appears to ha\\-e been built in an elegant style of Grecian architecture), av\u00ab in some measure outstep the bounds originally prescribed, in which Monastic -dwellings Avere alone included; but their contiguity to the abbey, Avhich we have just noAV quitted, induces us to proceed to the next erection, called The Church op the Trinity ; It stands on a rising ground, North of the Abbey ; and, as the inhabit- ants say, was dedicated to the Holy Trinity ; in the front of this church is a cir- cular building upon a square base, which evidently was intended foo.* a belfry, a sufficient space being left for the rope to come down. Hence let us come to The Seven Churches, for Avhich Glandelagh has been for many centuries remarkable, and for which it will be celebrated, even Avhen the vestiges now remaining are no more. The entrance to the area, on Avhich these churches stand, is on the North-east side, through the ruins of a gateway, sixteen feet six inches in length,"], [355, "G L A by sixteen feet in Avidth ; the arches, which are still entire, are nine feet seven inches wide and ten feet high, and the ring-stones, of mountain granite, are the full depth of the Avail ; the outside arch is composed of twenty four stones, ancl the inside one of twenty seven, which are tAvo feet six inches in depth. \u2014 The Cathedral Church ranks as the first, and owes its origin to St. Keivin, by Avhom it was dedicated to the Patron Saints of the Abbey. It measures forty eight feet in length and thirty in Avidth ; on the South side Avere three small windows, and at the East end Avas an arch seventeen feet six inches Avide, behind Avhich Avas another building thirty seven feet six inches in length, by twenty three feet in width, Avith a beautiful AvindoAV at the East end, on the North are two small ones, and one on the South, with a door three feet eight inches wide, communicating to a small building of sixteen feet by ten, the door of the church is seven feet four inches high, three feet six inches Avide at top, and three feet ten at bottom : the jambs are composed of four courses and a lintel at top, over which is a discharging arch ; the stones are the entire depth of the Avails, Avith a reveal cut at the inside for the door, which appears to have turned on pivots ; holes are cut for bars across, and iron cramps and bolts appear in some places; several courses of this building are of hewn stone, as Avell as a kind of pilasters, which project from the ends of the wall to the front and rear, ancl measure two feet six inches in Avidth ; the Avail of the building to the East, Avithin these, is detached, and has the appearance ofa more modern style. Under a small AvindoAV, at the South side of the choir, is a tomb of freestone, ornamented, and in the cemetery stands a Round tower, one hundred and ten feet high, uncommonly Avell built, and in fine preservation, the roof alone having suffered by time ; at the bottom it measures fifty two feet in girth, and the walls are four feet thick. The remains of several crosses may still be seen amongst these ruins, and that situated in the cemetery of this church, particularly merits notice, being one entire stone, eleven feet in height \u2014 St. Keivin's Kitchen (its vulgar appellation), Avas undoubtedly one of the Seven Churches, ancl is now almost entire, having suffered alone in the ruin ofa Avindow, the only one in the church, this Avas placed about eight feet from the South-east angle, and was ornamented Avith an architrave elegantly Avrought, but being of free-stone, it was conveyed aAvay by the neighbouring inhab- itants, and brayed to powder for domestic use. The area of this church mea- sures tAventy tAvo feet nine inches by fifteen, in height it is twenty feet, and the Avails are three feet six in thickness ; at the East end is an arch five feet three inches in Avidth, which communicates to another building ten feet six in length,. by nine feet three in width ; on the North side of Avhich is a door two feet two inches Avide, which communicates with another chapel of the same length, and seven feet nine inches in width; each of these buildings Iras a small window in the centre to the East, the walls are three feet thick, and both measure twelve feet in height. The foundation, with two or three courses osthe building, is laid"], [356, "G L A of cut mountain grit ; the door is six feet eight inches high, two feet four inches wide at top, and two feet eight inches at bottom, most of the stones run through the entire thickness of the wall ; the lintel is five feet eight inches in length, by eleven inches and an half in depth, ancl a rude cornice, projecting about five inches, and measuring sour feet ten inches long, by six inches in depth, is worked out of the same stone. A round Belfry rises from the West end of the church, the entrance to it is through a square hole in the cove of the church, over which, between the cove and the roof, is a large space, open to the belfry, that received its light from a small windoAv. The height of this tower is about forty five feet; the roof, both of the church and toAver, is composed of thin stones, very neatly laid, and with a very high pitch ; the ridge of the roof is about thirty feet above the ground, and the double building at the rear, is only twenty feet; hav ino* ascended the roof of this building, Ave discover a groove cut in the East end of tbe larger building, Avhich sheAvs that this Avas not the original toAver, but much higher ancl narroAver than the former; indeed the walls of the double building are separated from those of the larger, and, though undoubtedly very an cient, vet the inferiority of the materials and Avorkmanship, evidently sIioav that this Avork Avas posterior to the former, and erected by much less skilful builders. \u2014 Our Lady's Church, the most Westward of the seven, aud nearly opposite to the Cathedral, is now almost in ruins; but from the doorway, and the few remains of Avails, it appears to have been built with more knoAvledge osthe art than the other buildings. The door consists of only three courses ; the lintel is five feet six inches in length, and fourteen inches and an half in depth ; the door is six soet four in height, two feet six in Avidth at top, and two feet ten at bottom; a kind of architrave is Avorked round the door six inches broad, and in the bottom of the lintel an ornament is Avrought in a cross resembling the flyer of a stamping press. The Avails are carried up with heAvn stone, in general of a large size, to about the height of the door, and the remainder are'of the rude mountain rag-stone, but laid incomparably well. At the East end was an arch of hewn stone exactly similar to that osthe Cathedral. \u2014 The Rhefeart, literally the Sepulchre of Kings, is famous for having seven princes interred within its limits ; in this church i$ the tomb of Mac Mthuil, or O'Toole, the ancient Chieftain osthe country, with the following inscription, in the Irish character : \u2014 JESUS CHRIST Mile Deacb Feucb Corp Re Mac Mthuil. See here the Resting-place of the body of King Mac Tbuill, who died in Christ 1010. . Many others of this family are said to have been interred here, where a stone cross, .elegantly carved, is still preserved. \u2014 Priory of St. Saviour, commonly called the Eastern Church. Of this building, little can be said, the foundation Only remaining ; but about five years since, a quantity of stone, remarkably well"], [357, "G L A wrought, was discovered here, and on removing an heap of rubbish, the collection of many centuries, two clusters of columns Avere found, with curious emblematic decorations, Avhich had supported a great fretted arch, composed of the before- mentioned stones, which led to the discovery. \u2014 The Ivy Church, is situated somewhat to the WestAvard, and has large breaches in its walls long since over- grown Avith ivy; nothing Avorthy of remark can be found in this building, which is entirely unroofed. \u2014 Teampullna Skellig. Situated in the recess of the South mountain, Avas the ancient Priory of the Rock, ancl was also called, The Temple of the Desert, both expressive of the Irish appellation. \u2014 The celebrated Bed of St. Keivin, on the South side of tbe Lough, is a cave, hewn in the solid rock, on the side osthe mountain, exceeding difficult in ascent and terrible in prospect, for it hangs perpendicular over the lake, at an alarming height above the surface of the water; at a small distance from this bed, on the same side of the mountain, are to be seen, the ruins of a small stone building, called St. Keivin's Cell.\u2014 We shall now bid adieu to this illustrious Seminary, which (in the language of a late eminent Avriter) ' was once the Luminary of the Western World, Avhence savage Septs and roving barbarians derived tbe benefits of knowledge and tbe blessings of religion'. The romantic shape of the surrounding- Mountains, many of Avhich are covered with a fresh spring of Avood, and others, though of a surprising height, retaining the liveliest verdure almost throughout the year; these, added to the winding form ofa very fertile valley, which termi- nates in a Lake of considerable extent, increase our veneration ; in a word, on a re- view of such a scene, ' to abstract the mind from all local emotion Avould be im- possible, if it were endeavoured, ancl Avould be foolish, if it were possible. What- ever withdraAVs us from the poAver of our senses; Avhatever makes the past, the distant, or the future, predominate over the present, advances us in the dignity of thinking beings. Far from us and from our friends be such frigid philosophy as may conduct us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dig nified by Avisdom or by virtue.

The architecture of this erection was uncommonly fine, the building consists of an high steeple nearly square, supported on each side by a beautiful Gothic arch, and in the centre by a great variety of ogives passing diagonally from each angle, &c. : on the East side thereof is a small Chapel, 21 feet in breadth and 24 in length; the roof is arched, and beautifully supported by a number of ogives from the sides and angles ; on the South side is a Gothic tomb, which, according to O'Hallaran, is that of the founder, with a cross thereon but no inscription ; the tradition of the"], [374, "HOR place, however, informs us, that this tomb was erected for the Good Woman, Avho brought the Holy relique hither : between the nave and steeple is a space of 21 f. 6 in. in breadth, and 30 in length, detached from the nave by an arch, Avhich, we suppose, made a part of the choir : the nave is 49 feet broad, ancl 58 long; on each side is an arcade of four arches, with lateral aisles Avhich pass on either side of that part we conclude to have been the choir : the entrance is by a door at the \u2022West end, under a large window.

The difference in the work of this monastery is very extraordinary; nothing could have been more highly finished than the steeple and chapels, wliich are built of marble and limestone, yet the nave, the aisles, and adjoining ruins, are miserably mean.

Several Chapters of this Order were holden in Atherdee and in Dublin by David O'Buge, who was born in this town, and was a man of sound erudition, as such, he was in the highest estimation at Oxford and at Treves in Germany, and Avrote several learned works. He was well versed in Divinity, Philosophy, Rhetorick, and the Canon and Civil laAV, and Avas generally called the burning Light, the Mirror, and the Ornament of his country.

The River Bann is the only outlet for seven rivers and innumerable streams, that pour their tributary Avaters into this great Inland sea; Avhich, though by far the largest, is by no means the most beautiful of the Irish lakes. The shores are mostly formed either by an inanimate strand, or marshy borders liable to frequent floods; and are, of course, deficient in those \\-aried banks and bold promontories, without Avhich such extensive sheets of water cannot haA*c a picturesque effect, unless Avhen the uniformity is broken by frequent Islands of different size ancl character: \u2014 but there are only tAvo in this Lake ; a very small one near the mouth of the Blackwater, and Ram Island, Avithin a short distance of the Antrim shore, remarkable only for an ancient Round tower. The vieAVs are more pleasing in Lough Beg, a small Lake, into which these waters again expand, after a course of about a mile through a very contracted channel. The form of Lough Beg, its Islands, some Avooded points of land, Avith intervening lawns ancl rocks, the magnificent Rotunda at Bal lyscullen, and the beautiful lightness of Toome-Bridge, produce the most happy effect.

The situation chosen by these Religious was very singular. The Island, whereon the Monastery is built, consists of about two acres of dry ground; all the surrounding parts being a soft morass, scarcely accessible by human feet, and yet, on this Isle stands the remains of a beautiful edifice ; not large, but constructed in so fine a style, and with such materials, as excites our wonder Iioav they could have been transported thither. The length of the Church is 44 feet, the width about 18 ; the arches of the Choir and the Western portal are semicircular, and adorned Avith a variety of curious mouldings ; the WindoAvs were contrasted arches, such as appear over the West entrance to the church of St. Edmund's Bury, in Suffolk, but they are decaying, and some are fallen doAvn. The antiquity of this Monastery is indisputable ; for it is mentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis, who came into Ireland in 1185, as Preceptor ancl Secre tary to King John, then Earl of Morton. He says this Island borders upon North Munster and the confines of Leinster, and that there a feAV Culdees, or Colidei, did devoutly serve God. To tbe East of the Abbey Church is a small Oratory, but no vestige of Monastic dwellings can be found on this Isle, save only the Abbey and the Abbot's room adjoining it, which Avas over the Cellars, and but small ; whatever others might have been, were probaly formed of wood, and in the lapse of many centuries have ceased to exist. Superstition established an opinion, so early as the age of Giraldus, that no person could die in this Isle let his malady be ever so extreme, or his fate ever so urgent : the merits of the Patron Saint and those of his Religious, secured this privilege to an Isle so favour ed, and hence it acquired the appellation of Insula Viventium, or, The Island of the Living. This Legendary celebrity brought, from tbe remotest parts, innu merable Pilgrims, to expiate their sins at the altar of St. Columba, and a gainful trade was carried on for more than Ten centuries; which enabled the monks to improve their Abbey and add such decorations as the fashion and taste osthe clay required : for we are not to suppose, that the present church is the same as the original, Avhich Avas erected in the Seventh century : that Avas probably of Avood, in Avhich state it continued till the invasion of the Ostmen, Avhen a neAv style of Architecture commenced, and Monaincha Avas constructed of more durable materials. However, the salubrity and supernatural power of the Isle Avas not so great as to prevent the emigration of its Religious inhabitants to the main land. They found the noxious vapours of the surrounding marshes ancl swamps highly injurious to their constitutions, and tbey, as Ware informs us, fixed their residence at Corbally ; Avhere is at this day, in good preservation, a small neat Chapel of a cruciform shape, Avith narroAV slits for windows, and many other particulars indicating a respectable antiquity.

D. 1568, it was found that the Monastery of Canons Regular of the Virgin Mary, in the Island of the Living, otherwise called Inchenebo, was seized of the folloAving lands ;"], [580, "M O N the Island, Avhich contained three acres of moor, wherein were tAvo Chapels ; and near the island, a Village, called Corballi, in which the Prior and Convent dAvelt, where also Avas a Church, formerly the church of the Priory and Parish, and is still the parish church ; in this village Avere eight waste cottages, and the land Avhich belonged to the priory consisted of 180 acres of arable and pasture, annual value 30s. ; 140 of unprofitable, and 16 acres of Avood ancl under- Avood, annual value ,\u00a30..2..8, &c.

It is hand somely situate on each side of the River Barroxv, Avhich divides the town ; the greater part thereof being in the Queen's County. The Magistrates are a Sovereign, two Portrieves, and a Recorder. It gives title of Earl to the family of Daxvson. According to the Ecclesiastical Report, the parish of Lea cannot well be consid ered without reference to the town of Portarlington. At Lea, two miles from Portarlington, there is a decayed old Church, which can scarcely be prevented by ordinary repairs from falling. It is inconveniently situate for the toAvn, and equally so for the numerous Protestant Inhabitants of the country. By a plurality of voices, at a late vestry, it has, therefore, been determined to change its site, and to re-build it still further from the town, by Avhich means Portarlington, containing about 1500 inhabitants, Avill be in a worse state than it now is. In Portarlington there are two Chapels, and two Schools, endowed by the Earl of Gahvay, in 1702; one Chapel, and School, for Protestant French Refugees, and the like for the English Protestant Settlers and native Irish, on his Lordship's Estate. A rent-charge of ,\u00a340. per annum was settled on each Chaplain, \u00ab\u00a320. per annum on the English Schoolmaster, and \u00a3.12, on the French master; and the Bishop of Kildare, the Diocesan, and his successors, were appointed trustees for ever. The chapels, and schools, Avith their endoAvments, Avere accordingly conveyed to the Bishop, for the time being, and shortly after, because there Avere many French Protestants in the place, a pension of \u00a350. was granted to the French Chaplain, for the time being, Avhich is enjoyed to this day. When the chapels Avere conveyed in trust to the Bishop, they were newly built; repairs Avere little thought of; and the fund, provided for that purpose, Avas only a fine of <\u00a320., to be paid on the demise of each of three lives, on the perpetual renewal of Avhich, the lands, charged Avith the above rent of \u00a3 122., are holden for ever. At present there is one sum of \u00a3.20. in baud, Avhich bears interest : but, as the two Chapels are absolutely in ruins, and must be shortly altogether abandoned for Avant of necessary repairs, the Bishop considers himself (so far as the buildings are concerned) incapable of ful filling the purposes of this trust.

The Hon. and Right Rev. PoAver French le Poer, D- D. andWTL. D., Lord Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, in 1802. It is 74^- m. S. S. W. from Dublin. It has six Post-days in the Aveek. The Fairs are holden on the 4th of May, 24th of June, and 25th of October. This City sends one Member to Parliament; the Electors being, Freemen and Freeholders. It Avas originally built in the year 879, but destroyed, in 981 : It was considerably enlarged by Earl Strongbow, in 1171; and still further, in the reign of King Henry the Seventh, who granted clivers privileges to the citizens. King Richard the Second landed, and Avas crowned here, in 1399- In 1690, King James the Second embarked from hence for France, after the Battle of the Boyne. King William the Third resided here tAvice, and confirmed its Privileges. Here is a Charter School, for 60 Boys. The Members of the Corporation consist of a Mayor, Recorder, two Sheriffs, 18 Aldermen, and 19 Assistants, a Town Clerk, Coroner, Clerk of tbe Crown and Peace, Mareschal, Searcher, Public Notary, Water-Bailiff, SAVord-Bearer, four Serjeants at Mace, and other Officers. The Privileges of their Charter are very extensive. The City of Waterford is well built, and contains about 35,000 souls. It stands on the South side of the River Suir, which is embanked by a very noble Quay, extending the whole leno-th of the Town: Vessels of great burden can come up to this Quay, but the largest ships generally lie a few miles lower down : a very flourishing commerce with England, and other countries, is the happy consequence of sucb a situation. The principal articles of Export are beef, pork, butter, grain, and linen. Packet-boats are also established between this Port, and Milford Haven in South Wales, for the convenience of the South of Ireland. As tliere is no bridge over the Suir below Carrick, the only communication with the County of 4 u"], [736, "WAT Kilkenny is by a Ferry, an inconvenience to which the great depth and breadth osthe ri\\'er has hitherto compelled the inhabitants to submit. This city is about twelve miles distant from the Sea : The harbour runs almost tAvelve miles up the country, nearly in a straight line, and is all the way deep and clear. Here are several Charity Sehools, and Humane Foundations, well supported: Many of the public edifices are extremely elegant : Tbe private dwellings are generally modern, and Avith the other improvements of the city, keep pace Avith the increase of its opulence. It gives title of Viscount to the family of Lumley, that of Earl to the family of Talbot, and that of Marquess to the Earl of Tyrone. The See of Water ford (which is Aralued in the King's Books at \u00a3.72.. 8.. 1 Irish Money,) was united, according to Dr. Beaufort, in tbe year 1536, to the See of Lismore : The Bishoprick of Lismore had been founded in tlie beginning of the Seventh century ; but that of Waterford Avas not established until the Eleventh, Avhen the Ostmen or Danes settled on the Irish Coast. This very small Diocese is confined to the Eastern part of the County of Waterford, ancl does not extend above 10 miles in length, ancl 7 miles m breadth. But the Diocese of Lismore is 30 miles long, and about 29 miles broad, including the greatest part of the County of Waterford, and a considerable portion of tbat of Tipperary. The Union stretches in length 39- miles from East to West, and 29 miles in breadth. The Chapter of Waterford consists only of the Dean, Precentor (see, Kilbarrymeaden), Chancellor (see, Monemointer), and Treasurer (see, Lisnakill), for there are no Prebendaries, and the Archdeacon has not a vote. The Cathedral of Waterford is a very elegant church, erected Avithin a feAV years. Tbe Bishop's Palace, Avliich stands close by it, is a handsome modern structure of no great size, and very much confined in situation, \u2014 \" The Priory of St. Catherine is the first House of Religion Avhich appears ; it Avas founded by the Ostmen for Augustinian Canons of the Congregation of St. Victor, but Ave know not at Avhat period. \u2014 The Hospital of St. Stephen, in St. Stephen's Street, was founded for Lepers, and endowed by the Power family. This Hospital must have been erected before tbe Benedictine Abbey, for John Earl of Morton, in his Charter to that Abbey, confirmed the Leper-House to the Poor of the City.\u2014 John Earl of Morton arrived in Waterford, A. D. 1185, when he founded the Priory of St. John the Evangelist in the suburbs of the City, for Monks of the Order of St, Benedict, and confirmed to them the lands of Ballyowedin. In the Charter he calls it his Alms-House, and makes it a Cell to the Abbey of St. Peter and St Paul in the City of Bath, Somersetshire. Peter de Fonte Avas a munificent Bene factor to this House.\u2014 The Friars Preachers, or Dominicans, were introduced into this city, A.D. 1226. And upon application of the Citizens to King Henry III, on the 20th of February, he granted his Royal approbation, that their intend ed house should be built on that waste piece of ground, late the site of an ancient tower. The building, Avas accordingly begun, and concluded. The steeple was a very strong building, and the Monastery (of St. Saviour), noAv the County"], [737, "WES Court-house, is called Black Friars. \u2014 A Friary Avas founded, in 1240, for Con ventual Franciscans by the Lord Hugh Purcel, who was interred in the same year, on the right hand of the High Altar. The steeple is still entire, and, with the rest of the Abbey, is constantly kept in repair. Here are several ancient Tombs, on one is the figure of a man in armour, in high relief, Avith a shield on his left arm, on which are three Lions passant guardant in pale, but no inscription (this Avas the monument of the Founder). The Holy Ghost Hospital has been since erected on part of the ruins of the Friary.\" \u2014 ArchdaWs Monast. Hibern. pp. 698. et seq.
