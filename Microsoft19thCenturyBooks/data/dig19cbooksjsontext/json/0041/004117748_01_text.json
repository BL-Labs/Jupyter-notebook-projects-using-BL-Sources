In the Preface to the last edition of this Treatise, the classification of Minerals then adopted was announced as only a temporary expedient. The system of Mohs, valuable in its day, had subserved its end ; and in throw ing off its shackles for the more consistent principles flowing from recent views in Chemistry, the many difficulties in the way of perfecting a new classification led the author to an arrangement which should \"serve the convenience of the student without pretending to strict science.\" A classification on chemical principles was however proposed in the latter part of the volume, in which the Berzelian method was coupled with crys tallography, in a manner calculated to display the relations of species in com position as well as form, and prominently \" exhibit the various cases of isomorphism and pleomorphism among Minerals.\" The progress of Science has afforded the means of giving greater precision and simplicity to this arrangement, until now it seems entitled to become the authorized method of a System of Mineralogy. Whether regarded from a physical or chemical point of view, the groupings appear in general to be a faithful exhibition of the true affinities of the species. The mind uneducated in Science may revolt at seeing a metallic mineral, as galena, side by side with one of unmetallic lustre, as blende; and some systems, in accordance with this prejudice, place these species in separate orders. Like the jeweller, without as good reason, the same works have the diamond and sapphire in a common group. But it is one of the sublime lessons taught in the very portals of Chemistry, that nature rests no grand distinctions on lustre, hardness, or color, which are mere externals, and this truth should be acknowledged by the Mineralogist rather than defied. Others, while recognizing the close relations of the carbonates of lime, iron, zinc and manganese, (calcite, spathic iron, smithsonite and diallogite,) or of the silicates of lime, iron, manganese, (wollastonite, augite, rhodonite,) are somewhat startled by finding silicate of zinc, or silicate of copper, among the silicates of the earths or of other oxyds. But the distinction of \" useful \" and \"useless,\" or \"ores\" and \"stones,\" .although bearing on \"economy,\" is not Science. The advantages which the arrangement of the last edition afforded those interested in mining and metallurgy, is secured in the present volumes by an index to the useful ores, in which their distinctive characters and their rela-"], [14, "6 PREFACE. tive importance in the Arts are mentioned, and references are given to the pages where the full descriptions are to be found. During the four years since the appearance of the last edition, the Science of Mineralogy has increased in species from 625 to 660 ; and this notwith- standing the bankruptcy of some 45 of the number. The important work of Rammelsberg on Chemical Mineralogy, has been continued in a fifth Supplement, issued in 1853. A similar review of the Progress of the Sci- ence by Dr. Gustav Adolph Kenngott, conducted with like thoroughness, though with less criticism, has appeared in Vienna, and already two large volumes have been issued, one reviewing the Science for the years 1844 to 1849, the other, for 1850 and 1851. During this period also, Professor Gustav Rose has published his Krystallo-chemische Mineral-System (1853) ; Professor Von Kobell, a work on Mineralogical Nomenclature (1853), and a new edition of his excellent Tables for the Determination of Minerals, (1853) ; Dr. Franz Leydolt and Professor Adolf Machatschek, of Vienna, their elements of Mineralogy based on the system of Mohs (1853); Dr. Kenngott of Vienna, \"Das Mohs'sche Mineralsystem\" (1853), and also a portfolio of plates of figures for the construction of Models of crystals (1854) ; Professor Quenstedt of Tubingen, the first part of a Treatise on Mineralogy (1854) ; Dr. C. F. Naumann, a revised edition of his invaluable Elements of Crystallography (1854) ; Dr. Friederich Pfaff of Erlangen, Elements of the Mathematical Relations of Crystals (1853) ; F. H. Schro- der of Clausthal, Dr. Rammelsberg of Berlin, and Jos. Pecirka of Prague, smaller Manuals on the same subject, (1852, 1853) ; Dr. J. Zimmermann of Stuttgart, a small \"Tashenbuch der Mineralogie \" (1852); Nicolai von Kokscharov, the able Crystallographer of St. Petersburg, the first numbers of his \"Mineralogie Russlands,\" in quarto, (1853, 1854); H. J. Brooke and W. H. Miller, a new and original Treatise under the title of Phillips's Mineralogy (1852) ; C. F. Plattner, an enlarged edition of his extended Treatise on the Blowpipe (1853) : besides the great work of Dr. Gustav Bischof, on Chemical and Physical Geology, begun in 1846, now number- ing 2950 pages, (the last issue in 1853), and yet wanting another part to be complete; also G. H.Otto Volger's Essays on the Development of Minerals, (Studien zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Mineralien,) as the basis of Sci- entific Geology and a rational Mineral Chemistry, (Zurich, 1854); and von Waltershausen's Treatise on the Volcanic Rocks of Sicily and Iceland. Moreover, various valuable papers have been issued in Scientific Journals and Transactions abroad, by Haidinger, Rammelsberg, Breithaupt, Scheerer, von Kobell, Rose, Bunsen, Hermann, von Rath, Hausmann, Sandberger, Wohler, Baer, Kenngott, Schabus, Kokscharov, Scacchi, Meneghini, Delesse, Damour, Deville, Descloizeaux, Senarmont, Chapman, Mallet,"], [15, "7 PREFACE. Scott, Percy, and other able investigators. In this country have appeared Foster & Whitney's Report on the Geology and Mineralogy of the Lake Superior Region, (1851 and 1853); and J. D. Whitney's Mineral Wealth of the United States (1854). Moreover, Dr. J. Lawrence Smith and G. J. Brush, have labored with important results in American Mineralogy, clear ing away many doubtful species ; and other researches have been pub lished by T. S. Hunt, F. A. Genth, J. C. Booth, J. D. Whitney, C. U. Shepard, J. W. Mallet, W. P. Blake, M. H. Boye and T. H. Garrett. Of all these Publications, Bischof 's \" Lehrbuch\" stands first in importance. Mineralogy was well nigh a lifeless Science, having only powers of increase by accretion, like the objects of which it treats, \u2014 the addition of a new Min eral now and then being the great event of interest in its progress. Bisch of, by his elaborate researches and profound views, has given it a new im pulse. He makes every analysis of a Mineral an important element in the study of Mineral history, showing the necessity of their multiplication, and well exposing the leanness of Chemical formulas when given as a substitute for analyses. The associations and collocations of Minerals, their changes from exposure to atmospheric and other agencies, and even the infinitesimal ingredients in their constitution, are all made to bear on the question of the origin and progress of Mineral and Rock Formations. A Mineral species is shown to have a history of its own, \u2014 its perfect state, its liabilities to altera tion and decay, its successive changes, and again its renovation or its meta morphosis into a new species. These views taken in their wide extent, con stitute the proper basis of the Science of Geology, and should have their full exposition in a work on that Science. But the elements of the subject are with propriety indicated in a Mineralogical Treatise. While dwelling with deserved emphasis on the researches of Bischof, we should not forget that others have labored in the same department,* prominent among whom, are Haidinger, Volger, Breithaupt, Blum, Bunsen and Delesse. The work next in importance, more especially in its bearing on the crys tallization of Minerals, is the \" Elementary Introduction to Mineralogy,\" by Brooke & Miller. It stands preeminent for its original measurements, and its thorough revision of the angles of Crystals, and will remain a permanent source of information on these points. In the preparation of the present edition, the author takes pleasure in making special acknowledgments to the work of Bischof, for facts and prin ciples relating to the Chemistry of the alteration of Minerals ; to Rammels berg's Supplement to his Chemical Mineralogy, a work whose earlier parts contributed largely to the preceding edition of this Treatise ; to Kenng ott's and Kokscharov's publications ; and to the critical observations in the \" Miner alsystem\" of G. Rose. Frequent use has also been made of the work of Brooke <fc Miller, in the crystallography of the species, from which the"], [16, "8 PREFACE, angles and planes of crystals have often been cited. The var.ous Scientific Periodicals of Russia, Germany, Italy. France and Britain, some of them down to June last, have been searched for their facts, and every effort has been made to post the work up to the day of publication. American Mineralogy owes much to the careful revision it has received at the hands of Messrs. Smith & Brush ; and the author would express his special personal obligations to each of these Chemists. From Dr. F. A. Genth, of Philadelphia, he has derived generous aid both in suggestions and results of researches. Mr. T. S. Hunt has kindly contributed several new analyses throwing much light on the minerals of Canada ; and valua ble observations and analyses have been received from J. D. Whitney and Professor Booth. Many and various have been the favors, in the way of new facts, opinions and recent discoveries, which the author owes to Mr. Louis S\u00e6mann of Paris. He is also largely indebted to Robert P. Greg, Jr., of Manchester, England, for information respecting the Mineralogy of Great Britain, liberally furnished from a work by him and W. G. Lettsom, now in the press. The author would also express his gratitude to Messrs. T. S. Hunt, C. M. Wheatley, B. Silliman Jr., L. Wilder, T. F. Seal, W. T. Vaux, L. Stadtmuller, and G. J. Brush, for the privilege of figuring Crystals of American Species in their possession. Similar favors were received from the lamented J. E. Teschemacher of Boston, who ever rejoiced to devote himself and his cabinet to the progress of the Science, and continued his communications with the author, until the day before his death in Novem ber last. In the preparation of this edition, the subject of Crystallography has been revised and simplified. A system of notation for the figures of Crys tals, both brief and simple, h*s been adopted ; and many new and original figures have been introduced. The hom\u0153omorphous relations of mineral species have been worked out with considerable care, in or ler to arrive at their true fundamental forms, and trace the bearing of the subject on their composition and classification. The Table of atomic weights has been cor rected according to the most recent results, and the percentages of the for mulas have been recalculated to correspond with it. The subject of pseu domorphs is treated at some length, and along with the descriptions of the species, a paragraph is devoted to the altered forms which each presents. These changes, together with the remodeling of the classification, and. the large additions throughout, render the Treatise more properly a new work, than a revised edition.

The productions of our globe naturally distribute themselves into three grand divisions, the Animal, the Vegetable, and the Mineral or Inorganic ; and our knowledge of the various kinds of objects in these departments constitutes the natural sciences, Zoology, Botany, and Mineralogy. The first two divisions include all beings possessed of vitality : beings which increase by an assimilation of nutritive substances taken internally ; which arrive at maturity by a series of successive developments; whose parts are mutually dependent, and cannot be separated without destroying the perfection of the individual ; which, after a certain period, lose the capability of continuing the usual functions of life, and consequently die. The powers of vitality being no longer present to counteract decomposition, death is soon followed by a complete destruction of the original living being. The third division, on the contrary, contains those natural objects that are not possessed of life ; objects which increase by accretion merely, or an external addition of particles unaltered by any powers of assimilation in the object ; which are equally per fect in the embryo state or at the earliest commencement of their formation, and in the enlarged individual ; whose individuality is not destroyed by a separation of parts; whose formation is originally the result of chemical attraction, and, consequently, they are not, from their nature, necessarily liable to decomposition. There is thus a strong line of demarkation in nature between o"], [26, "18 INTRODUCTION. those bodies which live, grow, and die, and those which exist only by virtue of chemical and cohesive forces. The whole range of inorganic substances, whether made by art or existing in the earth's crust, fall into the last division, for they are produced by the same laws, and by like modes of aggregation. They constitute the Inorganic Kingdom. Minerals, as the term is used, are those species of this vast kingdom, that occur ready made in the earth's crust. They exist by no different forces from the compound that proceeds from the laboratory ; for it matters not whether sulphuric acid and lime come together in the work shop of art or nature ; whether the hand of man bring the mate rials into juxtaposition, a running brook, a mineral spring, or a volcanic fumarole : the result in both cases is gypsum, identical in chemical, physical, and crystallographic characters. In many cases art has not yet found out the methods of imitating nature, and some of the requisites, as indefinite time, unlimited mass, weak and prolonged electric forces, and peculiar juxtaposition of ele ments and compounds, are not readily commanded by the chemist. Still the forces are the same in kind, and in this respect the inor ganic kingdom is single and undivided. The Science of Miner alogy hence treats of only a small part of the third kingdom of nature. It includes here and there a species from the system \u2014 that is, those species that happen to have been formed by out floor processes. The limits of the department are not based on any grand points of difference between these and other inorganic compounds ; they are assumed, in order to present together a col lection of facts, which the student conveniently considers in one connection \u2014 facts relating to the natural productions of our globe. It is important, at the outset, that the distinctions here laid down be fully appreciated ; for very partial views of nature are received, when minerals are supposed to constitute a complete system in themselves. The explorer of some contracted territory might as well claim the species he finds to constitute exclusively a kingdom, as one who takes a wider portion or the whole of the earth's surface. The scope of the word mineral is conventional. It is convenient to include under it, all inorganic natural objects which are proper chemical compounds, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous ; and this convenience is a sufficient ground for the course. Moreover the"], [27, "19 INTRODUCTION. physical conditions of solidity, liquidity, gaseity, are not even specific distinctions in the wide inorganic kingdom, and hence afford no reasonable or necessary limit to the mineral department. Mineralogy is closely related to the Science of Geology. The former considers minerals as independent bodies ; the latter, in their dependent relations, constituting soils and various rocks. It is the object of Mineralogy to describe the individual qualities of the several mineral species, while Geology treats of them only as associated in the structure of the earth. To an intermediate department, Chemical Geology, belongs the discussion of the origin and formation of minerals, both as simple species and as aggregated in rock masses. MINERALOGY: SUBDIVISIONS OF THE SUB.JECT ADOPTED IN THE FOLLOWING TREATISE. The aggregation of inorganic matter depends on a power called crystallization, or crystallogenic attraction, by the action of which minerals receive a regular structure and take on certain forms called crystals. This power is universal, like vitality in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and hence an inorganic species has as much its characteristic form as a plant or animal. Under the head of Crystallology, or, the Science of the Structure of Minerals, this subject occupies Part I. of the following treatise. Crystallology includes two sections; 1. Crystallography, or, descriptions of the crystalline forms of minerals ; 2. Crystal logeny, or, the origin ofthe forms and structure of crystals. The properties of minerals come next under consideration : \u2014 First, those depending on the transmission and reflection, of Light and Heat, on Electricity, Magnetism, Gravity, Cohesion, and also their relations to the senses of taste and smell, or their Taste and Odor. These, the Physical Properties of Minerals, constitute the subject of Part II. Next follow : \u2014 Part III. On the Chemical Characters and Relations of Minerals. Part IV. On Taxonomy, or Classification."], [28, "20 INTRODUCTION. Part V. Determinative Mineralogy, or Tables for the determina tion of Species. Part VI. Full descriptions of the species-, under the head of Descriptive Mineralogy. In treating of the properties of minerals, a work on Mineralogy is necessarily brief. A full discussion of the relations of crystals to light, heat, and electricity, would lead us out of our proper science into Physics ; for it is by means of crystals that many of the fundamental laws of light, heat, and electricity, are exhibited. These subjects are considered, therefore, only so far as they afford aid in discriminating among minerals, and throw light on the char acters of species."], [29, "MINERALOGY. PART I. CRYSTALLOLOGY, OR, THE SCIENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF MINERALS. SECTION I. CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. A crystal is an inorganic solid- bounded by plane surfaces symmetrically arranged, and resulting from the forces of the constituent molecules. In its original signification, this term was applied only to crystals of quartz, which the ancient philosophers believed to be water congealed by intense cold. Hence the term, from xpuafraXXoff, ice* It now includes all those regular solids that owe their formation to the attraction that produced the xputfraXXoj of the ancients, or which, like that, possess a regular form, whatever may be the color or the degree of transparency of opacity.

They occur of all sizes, from the merest * Diodorus II. p. 163, Wess. \u2014 roiis yap KpvardXXovi \\16nv5 rrlv oiicratnv ii; vSaros Kadapov iraytpTOi, oiiy vkq Ipv^ovg, d\\\\ virH Bciov Trvpoq Svva[i\u20acl0S.

A single ciystal of quartz now at Milan, is three and a quarter feet long, and five and a half in circumference ; and its weight is estimated at eight hun dred and seventy pounds. One of the gigantic beryls from Ac worth, New Hampshire, measures four feet in length, and two and a half in circumference ; and another at Grafton, is over four feet long, and thirty-two inches in one of its diameters, and does not weigh less than two and a half tons. But the highest perfection of form and transparency are found only in crystals of small size. Variety and Constancy of Form. \u2014 Each mineral, as has been remarked, has its own mode of crystallization, by which it may be distinguished, just as we distinguish a plant by its characters and mode of growth. For example, a crystal of calc spar is known at once by its angles, wherever it may have been found, and also by a peculiarity of internal structure. The same is true for other species : consequently, measurement of angles and examination of structure' have become important means of distinguishing minerals. The constancy of angle between similar planes in the same species, is a fact of the highest importance in the science : it is not abso lutely perfect, owing to some causes hereafter to be stated, yet it admits of but little variation. The variety of form presented by a single mineral, may be very great. Calc spar is found in double pyramids, in prisms, rhombo hedrons, and many other forms; pyrites, in cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons; and so with other species. But however great the number, all the forms in each case are referable to a single type, and little skill is required to trace out extreme simplicity amid ap parent complexness : for all the various modifications take place according to a simple unvarying law. Thus a multiplicity of crys talline shapes is produced for each species. It is the object of Crystallography to point out the number and relations of these forms, and their internal structure ; and thence to explain the man ner in which the study of them is available in science. All inor ganic compounds \u2014 those of art as well as minerals \u2014 may take on a crystalline structure; and hence, this subject has the widest bear ing, for it is the science of structure in the whole inorganic world. Even the shapeless mass has a regular internal structure in its minute grains, of the same identical character with that of the crystal of like composition and species. In treating of the subject of Crystallography, we take up, first, the normal forms and structure of simple crystals, discussing (1) the Systems of Crystallisation; (2) the Modifications of form in Crys tals; _ (3) Cleavage or internal structure ; (4) Distortions and Irregu larities; (5) the Modes of Measurement. We next pass to abnor mal forms\u2014 -that is, (6) Twin or Compound Crystals ; then (7) to Mineral Aggregates ; and (8) to Pseudomorphous Crystals."], [31, "SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. 23 I. SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. The internal structure of crystals \u2014 especially their cleavage \u2014 led early crystallographers to the recognition of thirteen Primary Forms. There are crystals, as those of galena, whose internal structure is cubical, the mineral affording cubes on dissection ; there are others, as fluor spar, that afford the regular octahedron in a similar manner ; and there are others, as blende, whose cleavages yield dodecahedrons. In view of this fundamental character, which is one of the most unvarying and profoundly essential of a species, all of these forms, the cube, octahedron and dodecahedron have equal claims to be regarded as primary in the inorganic kingdom. In the same manner we arrive at the other so-called primary -forms. But viewed without reference to structure, several of these forms are essentially identical ; and they may all be included under six Systems of Crystallization. In many species no internal structure is apparent ; and in many others it is ambiguous, or affords two or more distinct forms at the same time; so that often a. prim aiy form cannot be recognized. Whereas the system of crystallization is in each case distinct and certain, being based on simple mathematical relations of the planes. The subject of Crystallography is much simplified by this classification of crystalline forms, and greater precision is given to the description of species. In treating of the subject of Crystallography, the parts of crys tals especially considered, are as follows : \u2014 1. Faces or planes: which are of various forms, triangular, square, rectangular, trapezoidal, polygonal. A series of three or more planes, making with one another parallel intersections, is called a zone. 2. Edges : formed by the meeting of planes, and either rectan gular, obtuse, or acute. Edges are said to be similar, when the planes, by the meeting of which they are formed, are respec tively equal, and equally inclined to one another, unlike or dis similar, when not thus equal. 3. Plane angles : the angles of the faces. 4. Inters acial angles : the mutual inclinations of .two planes. 5. Solid angles : the meeting of three or more planes, and either trihedral, tetrahedral, polyhedral. Solid angles are said to be similar when included by the same number of plane angles, equal each to each, and equally inclined to one another. 6. Axes : lines connecting points diagonally opposite, as the apices of opposite solid angles, the centers of opposite edges, or of opposite faces. In Crystallography there are three axes employed, (except ing for hexagonal forms), and these axes are either at right angles with one another, producing orthometric forms, or oblique, produ-"], [32, "24 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. cing clinometric forms * and they may be either all equal, or but two equal, or all unequal. In order to illustrate the relations of the six systems of crystalli zation, we may briefly mention, by way of introduction, the char acters of some of the simpler solids. 1. Prisms having a i-sided base,\u2014 When the base is square and the prism erect, as in f. 2, the form is a Right Square Prism ;f the four lateral planes are equal rectangles, either longer or shorter than the breadth, according to the height of the prism, and the basal edges are unlike the lateral. If these lateral planes equal the basal, and like them are squares, the form is a cube, (f. 1), bounded by six equal squares. When the base is a rectangle in stead of a square, the prism is a Right Rectangular Prism, (f. 3). In each of the forms mentioned the solid angles are eight in number, and are equal and rectangular. The edges, which are twelve in number, vary with the shape of the base and the height of the prism. In the cube the twelve are equal ; in the square prism the eight basal are equal, (four at each base), but they differ from the lateral ; in the rectangular prism, two at, each base differ in length from the other two, and hence there are three sets of edges, four in each. Again, the base may be a rhomb, a form in which the sides are equal ; an erect prism with such a base is a Right Rhombic Prism, (f. 4). As two of the angles in the base are obtuse, and two acute, the solid angles corresponding differ in like manner, two at each base ; and so also the lateral edges are two obtuse and two acute. But the four lateral faces, like the basal edges, will be equal. If, instead of a rhomb, the base is a rhomboid, a figure in which * Orthometric, from opbos, straight, and jit-rpov, measure; clinometric, from k\\ivu, to incline', and pirpov. \\ The following figures represent the forms of bases alluded to : \u2014 Square. Rectangle. Rhomb. Rhomboid. The square and rhomb have equal sides : the rectangle and rhomboid have only the opposites equal."], [33, "SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. 25 two opposite sides are unequal to the other two, the four lateral faces will correspond to the basal edges, and only the opposites be equal. This form is the Right Rhomboidal Prism, (similar to f. 4, or like f. 5, if placed on one of its lateral planes). Again, the base may be a rhomb, but the prism stand oblique on its base. Thus we have, as another form, an Oblique Rhombic Prism, (f. 6, a front view, and 7, a side view). As in the right rhombic prism, the basal edges are equal in length ; but from the inclination of the prism, two of these edges at each base are obtuse, and two acute. Such a prism may be longer or shorter than its breadth. If equal in length to its breadth, and the lateral planes just equal the basal, the form is hounded by six equal planes, like a cube, but having oblique angles ; it is called a Rhombo/iedron. Again, an oblique prism may have a rhomboidal instead of a rhombic base, and is then an Oblique Rhomboidal Prism, (f. 8). The edges of each base are of four kinds, for two opposite are longer than the other two, and, of each pair, one is obtuse and the other acute. So also with the solid angles ; the four are different. at each base. In this solid, therefore, only diagonally opposite edges are similar \u2014 that is, are equal in length and in the included angles ; and in the same manner, only opposite solid angles are equal, or consist of equal plane angles equally inclined. These particulars are readily understood from a model of the form. 2. Prisms homing a six-sided base. \u2014 When the prism is a regular hexagon, and erect, it is called the Hexagonal Prism, (f. 9 or 10). 3. Octahedrons. \u2014 Octahedrons are 9 10 8-faced solids, \u2014 as the term implies, derived from oxraws, S-ti?ne$, and k6ga, face. These faces are triangles, as in f. 11, 12, 13, and the form is like two 4-sided pyramids united base to base. Holding an octahedron with a solid angle uppermost, the upper and lower solid angles are called its vertical solid, angles ; the other four, its lateral or basal solid an gles ; and the horizontal plane in which the apices of the lateral solid angles lie, is the base of the octahedron. In the Regular Octahedron (f. 11) the base is square, and the eight faces are equal equilateral triangles. The edges are twelve and all equal ; the faces incline upon one another at an 4"], [34, "26 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. angle of 109\u00b0 28' 16\", and have the plane angles all 60\u00b0. The solid angles are six, and mutually equal. Like the cube the solid is every way symmetrical. When the base is square, and the vertical height greater or less than it is in the regular octahedron, (that is, the distance between the apices ofthe vertical solid angles greater or less than that be- ll 12 13 14 tween the apices of the lateral), the form is a Right Square Octahe dron, (f. 12), having the faces isosceles triangles^ buit not equilateral. The four basal edges are equal and similar, but they differ in length from the eight equal pyramidal edges, and also in the angle of the including planes. The vertical solid angles also differ in the plane angles ot which they consist from the lateral or basal. The base in other octahedrons is rhombic, and in this case the form is called a Right Rhombic Octahedron, (f. 13) : the length may be less or greater than the breadth. The basal edges are alike in length and other respects ; but as the plane angles of the base are of two kinds, two obtuse and two acute, so the pyramidal edges differ accordingly. 4. Dodecahedrons. \u2014 -A dodecahedron is bounded by twelve faces ; the name is from <5w<5\u00a3xa, twelve, and I8pu,faee. In a common kind of dodecahedron, called the Rhombic Dodecahedron, these faces are equal rhombs, as shown in f. 14. Like the octahedron and cube, this solid is every way symmetrical. The interfacial angles are 120\u00b0 ; and the plane angles of the faces are 109\u00b0 28' 16\" and 70\u00b0 31' 44\". The edges are twenty-four and similar. The solid angles are fourteen in number, and of two kinds ; eight obtuse, formed by the meeting of three obtuse plane angles, and six acute, enclosed each by four acute plane angles. From these descriptions of the thirteen simplest forms among crystals, we pass to the systems of crystallization. The of Crystallization are based on certain relations in the axes of these forms. In forms belonging to the same system, the axes are alike in number, and in their mutual intersections and general relations as to length. 1. Monometric or Tesseral System. In the Monometric system, the three axes are rectangular in their intersections and equal. The cube, regular octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron, which are here included, are alike in their perfect symmetry : the height,"], [35, "27 SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. length, and breadth are equal, and their axes are equal and rectan gular. In the cube (f. 1) these axes connect the centres of oppo site faces; in the octahedron, (f. 11), the apices of opposite solid angles ; in the dodecahedron, (f. 14). the apices of opposite acute solid angles. The relations of these forms, and the correspondence in their axes, will be understood after a brief notice of the transi tions between the forms. If the eight angles of a cube are sliced off evenly, keeping the planes equally inclined to the enclosing faces, we first obtain the form in f. 15, then that in f. 16, and finally a regular octahe dron, and the last disappearing point of each face of the cube is the apex of each solid angle of the octahedron. Hence, the axes of the former necessarily connect the apices of the solid angles of the latter. By cutting off as evenly the twelve edges of another cube, the knife being equally inclined to the faces, we have the form in f. 17 ; then f. 18 ; and finally, the rhombic dodecahedron, (f. 14), with the axes of the cube connecting the same points in each. These forms are thus mutually derivable. Moreover, they are often presented by the same mineral species, as is exemplified in galena, pyrites, and the diamond. The process may be reversed, and the cube made from the octa- hedron or dodecahedron, as will be readily understood from a com- parison, in order, off. 11, 16, 15, 1, and f. 14, 18, 17, 1. The octahedron also is changed to a rhombic dodecahedron by removing its twelve edges, (f. 19), and continuing the removal till the original faces are obliterated, thus producing the dodecahedron. The name Mononutric alludes to the equality of the axes, and is from fj-ovoj, one, and f^rpov, measure. Tesseral is from the Latin tes- sera, for cube or dice, and originally from the Greek word for four* 2. Dimetric System. In the Dimetric System, the three axes are rectangular in their intersections, and one, called the vertical, differs in length from the two lateral, which are equal. * Isometric system of Hausmann; Tessular of Mohs and Haidinger ; Tesseral of Naumann ; Regular of Weiss and G. Rose ; Cubic of Dufrenoy and Miller."], [36, "28 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The right square prism, (f. 2), aud square octahedron, (f. 12), are of this svstem. The axes of the prism connect the centres of oppo site face's, and cross at right angles. The octahedron has the same relation to the prism as the regular octahedron to the cube ; the 2n axes connect the apices of opposite solid angles. A replacement ofthe angles of the prism, (f. 20), con tinued, leads to the octahedron. The vertical axis is a varying axis, and may be longer or shorter than the lateral. The name of the system alludes to the two kinds of axes, and is from &c, twofold, and fAM-pov, measure* 3. Trimetric System. In the Trimetric System, the three axes are rectangular in their intersections, and unequal. It includes the right rectangular prism, (f. 3), the right rhombic. (f. 4), and the rhombic octahedron, (f. 13). The three axes inter sect at right angles, but are unequal. In the rectangular prism, the axes connect the centres of opposite faces ; in the rhombic prism, the vertical connects the centres of the basal faces, the late ral the centres of opposite lateral edges; in the octahedron, the axes connect the apices of opposite solid angles. By the transitions of these solids, it appears that these positions of the axes correspond throughout. If the lateral edges of a rec tangular prism are removed parallel to a vertical diagonal plane, the form becomes finally a rhombic prism, as shown in f. 3, 21, 22, 4 ; and so if the lateral edges of a rhombic prism are in like man ner removed, (f. 22, 21, 3), the result is a rectangular prism. This relation of these two forms is also shown by the rhombic prism within, f. 21 ; the Lateral faces of one prism are opposite the lateral edges of the other ; and the centre of the face ot the rectangular prism, where the axis terminates, is a point identical with the termination of the corresponding axis in the rhombic prism. It is, hence, apparent that the positions assigned to the axes are not ar bitrary, but depend on the actual relations of the forms. Both of these prisms occur often in the same mineral. The rhombic octa hedron, (f. 13), moreover, is derived from the rectangular prism, by * Pyramidal of Mohs ; Viergliedrige, or zwei-und-einaxige of Weiss; Tetragonal of Naumann ; Alonodimetric of Hausmann ; Quadratic of von Kobell."], [37, "SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. 29 removing the solid angles of the latter, a process begun in f. 23 ; and it comes from a rhombic prism by removing the basal edges of the prism, as shown in f. 24. The axes are the same points pre cisely in the three forms. The longer lateral axis is called the maerodiagonal, (from fj.axpos, long), and the other, the brachydiago nal, (from short). The name Trimetric alludes to the exist ence of axes of three kinds, (the three being unequal), and is from \u25a0rpis, threefold, and (xerpov.* 4. Monoclinic System. In the Monoclinic System, the three axes are uneciual ; one, called the vertical, (a), is inclined to one of the lateral, arid at right angles with the other, (c) ; and the two lateral (b, c) are at right angles with one another. It includes the right rhomboidal and oblique rhombic prisms. In the oblique rhombic prism, (f. 6), the vertical axis connects the centres of the bases, and the lateral the centres of opposite lateral edges ; the lateral, b, c, intersect one another at right angles ; the vertical is at right angles with c, but inclined to b. The axis c, which is at right angles with the other two, is called the orthodiag onal, (from opaV, straight) ; and the axis b, which is inclined to the vertical, is the clinodiagonal, (from xXivu, to incline). In the right rhomboidal prism the axes connect the centres of opposite faces. But they have the same relations as just explained : they are unequal, and there is one oblique intersection. To under stand the relations of these solids, the rhomboidal 25 prism must be placed on a rectangular plane for its base, as in f. 5, and then the vertical axes in the forms correspond, as shown in f. 25, in which both forms are combined. The removal of the lateral edges of one prism produces finally the other prism, the relation being the same as between the right rectangular prism and right rhombic. The name \u25a0monoclinic is from .uovoj, one, and xXivu, to incline.^ 5. Triclinic System.% In the Triclinic System, the three axes are unequal, and all the intersections {a to b, a to c, and b to c) are oblique. It includes the oblique rhomboidal prism, (f. 8). The name of the system is from rpij, three-times, and xXivw. * Prismatic or Orthotype of Mohs ; Ein-und-einaxige of Weiss ; Rhombic and Anisometric of Naumann; Binary of Weiss; Trimetric and Orthorhombic of Haus mann. \\ Hemi-prismatic and Hemiorthotype of Mohs ; Zwei-und-eingliederige of Weiss ; Mo noclinohedral of Naumann ; Klinorhombic of Kobell and Hausmann ; Augitic of Haidinger; Oblique of Miller. . \u2122 *? . .-*.. .. ,, a Taa- t- .... p aar \u25a0 m ,1.

The Diclinic system has been indicated by Naumann, as occur ring in an artificial salt. It differs from the triclinic in having two of the intersections (as a to b, and b to c) oblique, and one (a to c) rectangular. The prismatic form corresponding would be an ob lique rectangular prism, resembling f. 8. 6. The Hexagonal System* In this system there are three equal lateral axes, intersecting at angles of 60\u00b0, and a vertical axis of varying length at right angles with the lateral. It inclines the hexagonal prism and rhombohedron. In the hex agonal prism the vertical axis connects the centres of the bases. Tbe lateral axes connect the centres of the opposite lateral faces or opposite lateral edges, (f. 9, 10) ; in each case (as is seen from the character of a regular hexagon) the intersections are at angles of 60\u00b0. In the rhombohedron two of the angles, diagonally opposite, con sist of three equal plane angles ; the line connecting the apices of these two angles is the vertical axis (a) of the rhombohedron, and the solid is said to be in position when this line is in a vertical po sition, (f. 26, 27, 28). The other six solid angles are similar, and are called the lateral angles. Placing the rhombohedron in position, the apices of the six lateral solid angles are at equal distances around the vertical axes. There are also six lateral edges, alike symmetrical in position, around this axis ; and there are three terminal edges meeting at each extremity of the vertical axis. Looking down from above on a rhombohedron thus placed, the symmetry of arrangement in the lateral edges is at once perceived ; and it is readily understood that lines connecting the centres of opposite lateral edges, will be three in number, like those of the hexagonal prism, and will intersect at 60\u00b0. If the lat eral edges are replaced by planes parallel to the vertical axis, a regular hexagonal prism, terminated by a three-sided pyramid, is * Rhombohedral of Mohs ; Sechsgliedridge or drei-und einaxige of Weiss; Hexago nal of Naumann ; Monotrimetric of Hausmann."], [39, "31 SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. formed, as shown in f. 29 ; and if the lateral angles are removed in an analogous manner, another similar 30 31 form is produced, (f. 30). The two differ in the form of the planes R, at their extremities. When at the same time the vertical solid angle is re moved, the terminal plane of the hexagonal prism is formed, (f. 31). A hexagonal prism is reduced to a rhombohedron by removing alike three alternate edges of one base, and three edges of the other base alternate with these, (f. 31), and continuing the removal till the original form is obliterated ; or again, by removing in a correspond ingmanner the alternate solid angles. The hexagonal prism and rhombohedron are consequently closely related forms ; both are presented by calc spar and many other species. Rhombohedrons are obtuse when the angle at the terminal edges is greater than 90\u00b0, (f. 26, 27) ; and acute when it is less, (f. 28). In the former case, the terminal solid angles are made by the meeting of three equal obtuse plane angles, and the lateral by the meeting of one obtuse and two acute plane angles. In acute rhombohe drons the terminal edges are acute ; the lateral obtuse ; the termi nal solid angles are made by the meeting of three equal acute plane angles, and the lateral by the meeting of one acute and two obtuse plane angles. The cube is the intermediate form, having angles of 90\u00b0 ; when placed with an octahedral axis vertical, it has a position corresponding with that of the rhombohedron ; the axis a in a rhombohedron of 90\u00b0 (or cube) = Vf =1-224745. Under these systems. of crystallization, and the forms described, the variety of possible forms or dimensions is unlimited. The cube, regular octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron, are of unvarying relative dimensions. But the right square prism has one axis (the vertical) unequal to the other two, and it may be longer or shorter in any proportions. The right rhombic prisms may be indefinitely various in the angles between the lateral faces ; and the oblique prisms may differ in other angles also. Rhombohedrons may occur of every angle ; and the hexagonal prism, like the right square prism, may be indefinitely varied in the relation between the ver tical axis and the lateral. By these modes, and also by differences of structure hereafter to be explained, the actual fundamental forms of crystallization be come exceedingly numerous, although they belong to a few simple types. However numerous the kinds of substances existing in the inorganic kingdom, there is no limit, owing to this possible varia tion of dimensions, to the crystallographic distinctions which may exist among them. In each system there is a prism whose sides are parallel to the"], [40, "32 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. planes in which the axes lie, and whose edges equal the axes. Such is the square prism, f. 2, in the dimetric system ; the rectangular prism, f. 3, in the trimetric; f. 5 in the monoclinic, etc.: such prisms are the type-prisms of the several systems. There is also m each system (excluding the monometric) another prism, like the rhombic prism, (f. 4), in the trimetric, or f. 6 in the monoclinic system, which has for its lateral faces vertical planes connecting the extremities of the lateral axes : these are distinguished as the axial or fundamental prisms. The type-p>-isms are diagonal to these, and are called also the diagonal prisms.* II. MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. In explaining further the laws of crystallography, we might adopt either the mathematical method of referring directly to the axes of the forms, or the less abstract mode of basing the statements of the laws and their explanations on the type-prisms. The latter mode, as it affords the mind distinct solids for contemplation and comparison, is much more simple to the learner, and is here adopted. Moreover, as the edges of such prisms have the same directions and lengths as the axes, their relations to the derivative forms are more readily apprehended, than those of an assumed octahedron, or any other solid that might be taken as the type of the system. As the number of forms among the crystals of a single species is often quite large, there is at first much apparent difficulty in trac ing their connections, or distinguishing any symmetry of arrange ment. The law governing these modifications is, however, of the utmost simplicity. In its application, it is necessary to have fully * The relations ofthe several forms of crystals are elegantly exhibited by means of models made of glass. They may be made from common window or plate glass, by cutting the glass in the form of the faces of the solid to be made, and then unit ing them by means of glue. The author has generally found it. convenient to have a small cord between two adjacent pieces of glass, as the adhesion between the glass and the cord, by means of the glue, is much stronger than between two pieces of glass and glue alone. The forms thus far finished, may be rendered much firmer, and, at the same time, the glue and cord concealed, by covering the edges with nar row strips of paper, cut for the purpose; colored glazed paper is preferable, as it is less easily soiled. The primaries, when completed, may be placed within a second ary, which afterwards can be closed up, and the edges papered. In this way, a primary may be enclosed within any of its secondaries so as to exhibit clearly the relations of the two solids. The plane angles of the faces in the monometric solids, are given in the following pages ; by laying them off, a plane figure may be drawn, having the form of the desired face ; by then placing the plate of gla'ss over the figure, it may be cut with a diamond and a rule.

In the cube the edges are all similar in length, being equal and rectangular. In the right square prism, also, the edges are rectangular, yet the lateral are not equal to the basal in length, and therefore the two are dissimilar. In the right rhombic prism, the lateral edges are of the same length, but two are obtuse and two acute, and hence they are dissimilar ; the basal edges are similar to one another, being all rectangular and of equal length, and also being included by planes respectively equal. This similarity of edges and angles is in each case a consequence of the similar axial relations of the planes. I. LAWS OF SYMMETRY AND RESULTING FORMS. The modifications of crystals take place according to the follow ing simple laws : I. All. the similar parts of a crystal may be simultaneously and similarly modified. II. Half the similar parts of a crystal maybe similarly modified independently of the other half. The forms resulting according to the first law are termed holo lisdral forms, from oXoj, all, tSpu, face. All similar edges or similar angles of the type prisms, according to this law, will be alike in the number and positions of their planes. The forms proceeding from the second law are termed hemihe dral. According to it, half the similar parts are alike in their mod ifications, and unlike those of the other half; and the parts of either half thus modified are alternate or symmetrically related, so that the result is in general a symmetrical solid. The planes of one half are distinguished by the sign -J-, and those of the other by the sign \u25a0 \u2014 \u2022. The examples under the law of hemihedrism may be classed as follows, referring them to the type prisms of each system. I. Those forms in which half the similar angles or edges are modified independ ently of the other half, producing \u2014 1. In the monometric and dimetric systems, tetrahedral and sphenoidal forms, by the independent replacement of the alternate angles ; their opposite faces are not par allel, and they are hence called inclined hemihedrons ; as in Boracite, Copper pyrites. The replacement in the dimetric system of two opposite basal edges at one base, and the other two at the opposite base, is of the same kind ; as in Edingtonite. 2. In the trimetric system, monoclinic forms, by the replacement of half the similar parts of one base and the diagonally opposite of the other, unlike the other half; as in Datholite, Humite. 3. In the trimetric and hexagonal systems, hemimorphic forms, by independent replacements at the opposite extremities of the crystal; as in Topaz, Calamine, Tourmaline. i. In the rhombohedral system, by the replacements of the alternate basal edges or angles of the rhombohedron \u2014 forms usually called tetartohedral or quarter forms, on the ground that mathematically the rhombohedron is hemihedral to the hexagonal prism, which is the type of the hexagonal system. 5"], [42, "34 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. II. Those forms in which all the similar angles or edges are modified, but by half the full or normal number of planes, producing \u2014 1. In the monometric system pyritohcdral forms, by a replacement of the edges or angles; as in Pyrites. Such forms have opposite faces parallel, and are often called parallel hemihedrons. 2. In the dimetric system, pyramidal and scaleno'iilal forms, by a replacement of the eight solid angles, according to two methods. 3. In the hexagonal system, pyramidal and gyroidal forms, by a replacement of the solid angles of the hexagonal prism, or the six lateral angles of the rhombohe dron, according to two methods; as in Quartz and Apatite. Explanations of these kinds of hemihedrisni are given in the re marks which follow on the forms of the several systems of crystal lization. 1. Monometric System. 1. flololiri )t-iil. \u2014 In accordance with the first law of symmetry, if a single edge of a cube, octahedron or dodecahedron, be trun cated, all will be simultaneously truncated, (f. 17, 19, 43), for all are similar. If on an edge there is one plane inclined unequally to the adjoining faces, there will be two such planes, one inclined towards each face with like angles, as in f. 32 ; such edges are said to be beveled ; moreover all the edges of these solids will be simi larly beveled.* a. Tetrahexahedronj-. \u2014 A bevelment of the edges of a cube is represented in f. 32, and the result of a continuation of the process in f. 33. This form is bounded by twenty-four triangular faces. Figure 34 is a similar solid, proceeding from a different angle of bevelment. The above name indicates the general resemblance to the cube or hexahedron, and at the same time expresses the num ber of its faces. It is derived from <rerpoM\u00a3,four times, s|, six, and s5pa, face ; the 4x6-faced solid. The planes i2 in f. 35, which are observed to replace the solid angles of the octahedron inclining at the same time on its edges, when extended to the obliteration of the primary faces, produceZhe same form as above, (f. 33). The replacement of the six acute solid * An edge is beveled, when replaced by two planes, which are respectively in clined at equal angles to the adjacent faces. f Called Fhioroid, by Haidinger."], [43, "35 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. angles of the dodecahedron by four planes resting on its faces, (f. 36), if continued, results in the same solid.* By varying the angle of bevelment of the cube, tetrahexahe drons of different angles may be produced. b. Trisoctahedron, \u2014 The angles of the cube are represented as replaced by three planes in f. 37 and 47 ; in one, they incline on the primary faces ; in the other, on the edges of the cube. The completed forms obtained by these replacements are seen in f. 39 and 49. Fig. 38 is an intermediate form, between 37 and 39, having also octahedral planes, (1). The resulting solids, though con siderably unlike, have a general resemblance to octahedrons, with a three-sided pyramid substituted for each octahedral face. Like the octahedron, they are formed on the angles ofthe cube by a re- placement by three planes instead of one, which accounts for their general resemblance to this solid. The name, trisoctahedron, is de rived from r\u00a3i\u00a3, three-times, oxtw, eight, and iSpa, face, 3x8-faced solid. The faces of one of these solids are four-sided, or tetragonal, those ofthe other, three-sided, or trigonal ; they .are, therefore, dis tinguished by the names tetragonal trisoctahedron and trigonal tris octahedron. The usual name of the former is trapezohedron. The tetragonal trisoctahedron or trapezohedron-]- (f. 39) may be de- rived from the octahedron, by replacing its angles by four planes, inclining on its faces, (f. 41 or 42) ; from the dodecahedron, by a trun cation of its twenty-four edges, (f. 43, 44), or by replacing the solid angles, obtuse or acute, by planes inclined on the edges, (f. 45, * The system of notation used in the figures is explained on a following page. It may be observed here that the expressions, 22, 33, and the like, are to be read as if written, 2-2, 3-3 ; that i stands for infinity ; and that there is .thus a correspond ence between the mathematical symbols for the pianos, and the lettering.

The planes 33, on f. 41 and 45, result in the trapezohedron off. 40 ; and the planes 22, off. 42 and 43, in that off. 39. The truncation of the shorter edges of tetrahexahedrons produce trapezohedrons, (f. 46, 33 being the trapezohedral planes on the tetrahexahedron i |) ; and others proceed from planes on the angles inclined on the same edge. The trigonal Trisoctahedron (f. 49) has been observed to pro ceed from a cube by a replacement of the angles by three planes, as in f. 47. It proceeds from an octahedron by beveling its twelve edges, (f. 48), and from a dodecahedron by a replacement of its eight obtuse splid angles, by three planes inclining on the faces. c. Hexoctahedron.*\u2014 Figure 50 represents a cube, with six planes on each angle, and consequently forty-eight in all. The resultino solid is completed in f. 51.

Others, differing in their angles, may result from a re placement of the six acute solid angles of the dodecahedron by eight planes, or the eight obtuse by six planes. 2. Hemihedral. The exemplifications of the law of hemihedrism, are of frequent occurrence. Figure 53 is an example ofthe first kind of hemihedrism, in which half the angles of the cube are modified, while the remaining half are unmodified. Figure 67 is an instance of the second kind. All the edges are similarly replaced, but by one of the two beveling planes represent ed in f. 32. The plane i2 is enlarged in f. 68. From this last figure, it will be observed, that the suppressed planes are those which were alternate, and that two planes, i2, incline on each face, 0. The crystals have therefore a symmetrical character. Another instance is observed in f. 73, in which each angle ofthe cube is replaced by three out of the six intermediaries in f. 50 ; that is, by half the number of planes which the first law would require. A. Tetrahedral hemihedrons. a. Tetrahedron or Hemi-octahedron. \u2014 If half the angles of a cube are replaced by a single plane, (f. 53, 54), the resulting form is a tetrahedron or hemi-octahedron, (f. 55, 56, one (+) resulting from the angles modified in f. 53, and the other ( \u2014 ) from a replacement of the other set of angles.) The same form may proceed from an octahedron by an extension of one half of its faces to the oblite ration of the other half, (f. 57). The plane angles of the tetrahedron are 60\u00b0 ; the interfacial 70\u00b0 31\u00b0 44'.

Hemi-trisoctahedrons. \u2014 The planes 22 in f. 37, when occuring on but half the angles, produce the solid in f. 59. The faces are trigonal, and the solid is called a cuproid. The planes 2 in f. 47, when occuring on but half the angles of the cube and enlarged, form the solid in f. 60 ; its faces are tetrago nal, It is the deltohedron of Haidinger. Figure 61 represents the i cuproid combined with the tetrahe dron ; f. 62, the same with planes of a tetrahexahedron, *3 ; f. 63, with planes of a dodecahedron ; f. 64, with planes of a deltohedron, similar to f. 60. c.

It is the pyritoid of Haidinger."], [47, "MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. 39 Figures 71, 72, exhibit the planes on the octahedron, which, ex tended, give rise to f. 69. b. Parallel or Pyritohedral Hemi-hexoctuhedron. \u2014 When all the 8olid_ angles ofthe cube are replaced by three alternate planes out of six intermediaries, (f. 73), a form like that in f. 74 is pro- duced. It has parallel opposite faces. It is the diploid of Hai dinger. Figure 75 shows the same planes on an octahedron. 2. Dimetric System. The modifications of the basal and lateral edges of a square prism, take place independently, owing to their dissimilarity. The lateral edges are included by equal planes, and, therefore, may be truncated or beveled, (f. 76, 78). The basal edges are similarly replaced ; but being the intersections of unequal planes, they are never truncated or beveled. A plane on these edges, therefore, inclines unequally bn the adjacent faces, (f. 80, 83). The similar intermediary planes on each angle can be but two in number, (f. 88). The production of a square octahedron from the replacement of the angles of the square prism, is explained on page 28, (f. 20, 12). By giving different inclinations to the plane on the angles, other octahedrons are obtained of longer or shorter vertical axes. A truncation of the lateral edges of the typical square prism, skives rise to another square prism, (f. 77), the axial prism. Bevelment of the same lateral edges, (f. 78), affords eight-sided prisms, (f. 79). of different angles, according to the angle of bevelment. The fundamental octahedron (f. 12) proceeds from the axial prism, by a replacement of the basal edges, (f. 80, 81) ; the basal edges of this square prism corresponding to the angles of the other ; (compare f. 80 and 20). Another series of octahedrons is formed on the angles ofthe axial sqmare prism, (f. 82), or the basal"], [48, "40 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. edges of the diagonal square prism, f. 83 ; f. 84 represents the octahedron li of f. 83, and also within this, that of \\i. The octa- hedrons of one series replace the pyramidal edges of the other, (f. 85), or are situated on the angles basal or vertical, and incline on these edges, (f. 86), li or 2% being octahedral planes of one series, and 1 of the other. Figure 87 represents the octahedron 1, combined with the lateral faces of the diagonal or type prism. Two planes on each angle of a square prism, (as in f. 88), give rise to a double eight-sided pyramid, (f. 89), which may be of various proportions, according to the inclination. The same planes on the octahedron 1, either bevel the edges, (f. 90), or replace the angles by two planes corresponding to each terminal edge. In this solid the terminal edges are of two kinds, one, the axial, (2T), terminating in the poles of the lateral axes ; the other, the diagonal, ( Y), inter mediate in position. The hemihedral forms are as follows :\u2014 1. The sphenoidal, corres ponding to the tetrahedral of the monometric system, the alternate angles being replaced alike. Half the planes 1, off. 20, produce the scalene pyramid represented in f. 91 ; and the other half, that of f. 92 ; and two planes on half of the angles, afford the form in f. 93. Figure 94 represents the sphenoid with the vertical planes of the diagonal square prism ; and f. 95 shows the combination of"], [49, "MODD7ICATION8 OF CRYSTALS. 41 i 93, with the octahedron li. 2. Pyramidal, produced by the occurrence of one of the two planes on each angle, (see f. 88), the occurring plane at each extremity, about the edge of the prism, being on the same side of the edge, or in the same vertical line \u2014 as in f. 96. The resultant form is a square octahedron ; occurs in Tungsten. Another kind of hemihedrism may occur, whicli is like the last, except that the plane at each extremity, about each edge of the prism, is on different sides of the edge, as in f. 97 ; the resultant form is represented in f. 98. In 96, the plane is the left of one base, and (the prism being inverted) the right of the other, (or the reverse) ; in f. 97, the plane is the right of each base, (or the left). 3. Trimetric System. The edges of the right rectangular prism are of three kinds, (being diflerent in length), and those of each kind are, according to the law mentioned, independently modified, (f. 99, 103, 105). Moreover, none of them can be truncated or beveled, in conse quence of the inequality of their including planes. Planes on the angles incline unequally on the three adjacent, unequal planes. The angles are similar, and therefore will be modified simultaneously, (\u00a3 23). The lateral edges of the right rhombic prism admit of trunca tion and bevelment, because of the equality of the lateral planes. The obtuse, however, are modified independently of the acute, (f. 101, 102). The obtuse solid angles, and the acute, are also independent in their modifications, (f. 107, 108). The replace ments of the basal edges are similar and simultaneous, (f. 24). On page 28 it is shown that a replacement of the lateral edges of the rectangular prism, (f. 21, 22), produces a right rhombic prism. By varying the inclination ofthe replacing planes, differ- 6"], [50, "42 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. ent rhombic prism are obtained. In f. 99, i% I, and i 2, are planes of three such prisms, /, being the prism represented in f. 4, and in the interior of f. 100, having the same axes as the rectangular prism ; vi corresponding to the prism ?2 ?2, in f. 100, \u2014 (that is, having the same angle between the planes, as 'h i~i, in f. 99) ; and ii corresponding to the prism *2 -ii, in f. 100. Figure 101, rep resents tne rhombic prism I, with the same planes i7i, and f. 102, with the planes -12. A replacement of the basal edges produces other rhombic, prisms, which are horizontal in position, and are called domes, (from 8og.y}, or damns, house, or placed like the roof of a house). Figure 104 represents the dome corresponding to the planes 17 in f. 103 ; it is parallel to the longer lateral axis, and is called a macrodome, (from fiaxpos, large and dome). Figure 105 contains planes (li, 27) of two domes parallel to the shorter lateral axis, which are called brachydomes, (from fyo-yys, short and dome). These brachydomes are presented completed in f. 106, the outer being 27, and the inner 17. The former has the vertical axis twice that of the latter. In f. 107, the planes 17 and 17, (f. 103, 105), are repre sented on a rhombic prism, the angles of which they replace. The production of a rhombic octahedron, by replacing the angles 107 108 109 of a rectangular prism, or basal edges of a rhombic, i^ mentioned on page 28 ; (compare f. 23, 24, with 13). Other planes on the"], [51, "MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. 43 angles produce other octahedrons. The planes I2, in f. 108, cor respond to the octahedron of f. 109 \u2014 (that is, have the same mutual inclinations <as the faces of the latter); the longer lateral axis is twice that of f. 13, or that of the dotted figure in 109. The planes 22, in f. 110, in the same manner correspond to the octahedron inf. Ill, in which, both the vertical axis and one of the lateral are twice the same in f. 13. The planes 27, in f. 110, belong to a macrodome different from that in f. 103, 104. Hemihedrism, in the trimetric system, produces two kinds of forms. 1. Monoclinic, when the lower extremity of a crystal in front, and the diagonally'opposite, differ in their modifications from the upper extremity in front ; the forms resemble those of the monoclinic system, but differ in having the angle between the vertical and lateral axes 90\u00b0. An example is shown under datho lite and humite. 2. Hmimorphic, when all the similar parts of one base are modified alike, but unlike the corresponding parts of the other, as in calamine and topaz, (q. v.) In this system, the angle between O and the vertical prismatic planes, is 90\u00b0, and ii : ii=90\u00b0. 4. Monoclinic System In the Monoclinic System \u2022 the obliquity of the crystals (or of the vertical axis towards the clinodiagonal) makes the upper and lower parts in front different, one obtuse and the other acute, and they aire independently modified, as in f. 112, 113. But the angle < if the vertical axis with the orthodiagonal being right, and there fore alike on opposite sides, the planes on the four lateral angles"], [52, "44 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. of the oblique rhombic prism are alike, as in f. 114. The four planes li, in the last mentioned figure, make a clinodiagonal prism, or elinodome; the plane It, in f. 112, is a hemi-orthodome ; and the same with -li, f. 113. The lateral edges are replaced as in the trimetric system. The relation of the two forms, in f. 5 and 6, is shown in f. 25. Octahe drons may result in this system as in the trimetric ; but they consist of two sets of planes, or hemi-pyramids, as shown in i. 115, in which 1,1, are on the obtuse angles of the outer prism, or cor respond to the obtuse basal edges of the inner, while -1 are on the acute angles or edges. The completed oblique octahedron corresponds to the planes 1, 1, -1, -1, as in f. 115, 116. The ver tical axis a is oblique to b, the clinodiagonal, but at right angles 116 with c, the orthodiagonal. The angle of obliquity is called the angle y or C. Other octahedrons arise from planes of different inclinations. In this system, the angle between the plane 0 and ii, (f. 5), is 90\u00b0 ; O on other prismatic planes is an oblique angle ; ii on the faces of different clinodomes is oblique : ii on ii, and all hemi-orthodomes, =90\u00b0. The particular plane to be taken as 0, or as I, may be a question for particular species ; the 0 will always be one of the planes in the clinodi agonal section ; while any prismatic planes not parallel to either diagonal, or any octahedral planes, may be taken as /. When there is no very distinct cleavage to guide to a decision, (and even when such cleavage exists,) it is common, though not always best, to assume those planes as the fundamental form, which will render the calculations and symbols of the planes most simple. 5. Triclinic System. As only diagonally opposite edges or angles (f. 8) are similar in the Triclinic System, there can be in a triclinic crystal but two planes of a kind, as in f. 117, 118. The inclination of O on I, differs from 0 on /'. The prism formed by planes on the pris matic edges of I', s, parallel to the diagonals, has the same relation to the form in f. 8, as that of f. 5 lo f. 6, ofthe monoclinic system; but unlike the prisms of the nionoclinie system, O does not make"], [53, "MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTAL6. 45 a right angle with any of the lateral planes ; there are no right angles in triclinic forms. The replacement of the basal edges of the prism, in \u00a3 8, by homologous planes, may produce an octa hedron ; but it will be included by four sets of planes, two of a kind, as represented in f. 119. These planes occur independently on crystals, and, owing to their independence, actual octahedrons are not met with in nature. 6. Hexagonal System. 1. Holohedral. a. In the Jiexagonal prism, (f. 10), the basal edges are alike and have similar modifications, and the same is true of the lateral edges, and the solid angles. When a similar plane occurs on each basal edge, (f. 120), or each basal angle, (f. 121), the resulting solid is a double six-sided pyramid, (f. 122), called an isosceles dodecahedron, or a dihexagonal pyramid; it is the Quartzoid of Haidinger. Figure 121 represents planes of three different pyramids on the angles, viz., 12, |2, 22, which differ in the length of the vertical axis. Each solid angle of the hexagonal prism, may be replaced by two similar planes, (as inf. 123), 123 124 and the extension of such planes produces a double twelve-sided pyramid, (f. 124) \u2014 the berylloid. Tbe berylloid has two kinds of terminal edges, one, X, the ax ial ; the other, Y, the diagonal. The truncation of the lateral edges of the hexagonal prism leads to a secondary hexagonal prism, (f. 9), and (f. 121) diagonal to the first ; and bevelment leads to different twelve-sided prisms. Li the rhombohedron, the vertical solid angles, as they are formed by the meeting of three equal planes and equal plane angles, may be truncated, or replaced by three or six similar planes. The edges, for a similar reason, maybe either truncated or beveled."], [54, "46 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The terminal edges, however, are replaced independently ot the lateral. The lateral angles, six in number, are replaced simultaneously. Two like intermediary planes may occur on each. The derivation of two six-sided prisms from a rhombohedron, has been explained on page 30 ; one, by a truncath >n < if the six lateral edges, (f. 29); the other, by a replacement ofthe six lateral angles, by planes parallel to the vertical axis, (f. 30). The remain ing parts ofthe primary faces on the first of tbe above prisms, are rhombic ; those on the second, are pentagonal. A truncation of the terminal edges of the rhombohedron, is observed in f. 125. Since these edges are six in number,' three at one end of the crystal, alternating with three at the other, the solid formed by the extension of these planes, must be an oblique solid, contained under six equal faces: or, in a word, a rhombohedron. Moreover, because the lateral angles are six, and three alternate are nearer the lower extremity of the axis, and the remaining three near the upper extremity, the planes on these angles, if not parallel to the vertical axis, incline alternately above and below, (f. 126); and, therefore, by their extension, will jjjive rise to rhoinhohedrous. These rhombohedrons will differ in the lengths of their vertical axes, as these planes vary their inclination. The nearer they approach to parallelism to the vertical axis, the longer the a.\\is of the rhombohedron; and the six-sided prism formed on these angles may be considered a rhombohedron, with an infinite axis. Moreover, other rhombohedrons may be formed by replacing the terminal angles by three planes inclined on the faces or terminal edges; and as the planes of such secondary rhombohedrons &\\y proach horizontally, they approximate to tlie terminal or truuca-"], [55, "MODIFICATIONS OF CRY8TAL8. 47 ting plane, O, which plane may be viewed as a rhombohedron with the axis=0. In f. 127, the lateral edges of a rhombohedron are beveled; an extension of these beveling planes produces the solid represented in the dotted lines of this figure, which is called a scalenohedron. It is a solid included by twelve scalene faces. The twelve edges are of three kinds : 1, tbe longer terminal, Y ; 2, the shorter ter minal, X; 3, the basal, Z. By other beveling planes, (f. 128), other scalenohedrons are formed ; and as the vertical axis increases, they pass into the diagonal hexagonal prism, i2, (f. 9). This prism may hence be considered a scalenohedron with an infinite axis. Bevelments of the terminal edges (f. 129) give rise to other similar solids ; and replacements of the lateral angles by two planes, (f. 130), afford still other scalenohedrons. Again, the replacement of the terminal edges of scalenohedrons, or of the angles, by planes inclined on these edges, gives rise to different rhombohedrons. In f. 131 there are planes of the rhombohedron, iR ; in f. 132, planes of -5R ; in f. 1.33, planes of |i?; in f. 134, planes of -2R. A bevelment of the terminal edges, or a replace ment of the angles by two planes inclined against each terminal edge, produces other scalenohedrons, (f. 133, 134). . When a rhombohedron has its lateral angles replaced, as in f. 126, and the plane is inclined to the vertical axis at the same angle as R, a dihexagonal pyramid or quartzoid results. Such is the origin of the pyramids of crystals of quartz. In crystallographic calculations, the rhombohedron, scaleno hedron, and related forms, are regarded as hemihedral modifica tions of the hexagonal prism, and we proceed now to speak of them in this relation. 2. Hemihedral. As the rhombohedron results from a hexagonal prism by a re placement of the alternate basal edges (f. 31) or angles, it is in this relation hemihedral ; and since either set of alternate edges of tbe prism may give rise to a series of rhombohedrons, it is usual"], [56, "48 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. to distinguish one set by the sign +, and the other by the sign -. In the double pyramid of quartz, as just explained, we have a form in which both of these rhombohedrons, +R and -R, are combined, producing a symmetrical solid. The scalenohedrons have the same relation. To comprehend this form and other hemihedrons more fully, the holohedral form, in f. 123, may be again referred to. It is a hexagonal nnsm with two planes on the angles at either base, inclined on each face, one the right, (r), at the right upper angle of each face, the other the left, {Ij. In hemihedral forms, half of these planes are suppressed. 1. If, as in f. 135, the suppressed planes are those below, for the left face /, (f. 123), those above, for the middle /, those below, for the right, and so on, alternating around, the resulting forms are scalenohedrons ; for each occurring pair, I, r, corresponds, as is seen, to a face (R) of the rhombohedron. This kind of hemihe drism is called the rhombohedral, by Naumann. If the faces that are suppressed in f. 135, should be the occurring faces, and the others were suppressed, the same solid would result in an inverse position. If the rhombohedral plane R, in f. 135, is taken as +i?, then the scalenohedron, in the same figure, will be + , and the inverse one, \u2014 ; for, in f. 135, the planes I, R, r, belong to the same axial sector; while R would not be in the same sector with the planes of the inverse scalenohedron. Where vari ous scalenohedral planes occur together, there may be among them both + and \u2014 , with + or \u2014 rhombohedral planes. 2. In another kind of hemihedron, the occurring planes of the two, r, I, in f. 123, may be the r on each angle at one base, and the I on each at the other base, as in f. 136. This variety is exem plified in apatite. It is called the pyramidal hemihedrism by Naumann, the resulting solid being a six-sided pyramid. 3. In another kind of hemihedron, the occurring planes may be the r of both bases, as in f. 137, or the I of both bases. This occurs in quartz, (see under that species), and is called the trape zohedral by Naumann, the resulting solid, made up of such planes extended, being a trapezohedral double pyramid. It is also called gyroidal liemihedrism, the planes gyrating to the right or left at each base."], [57, "MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. 49 A triangular prism, a hemihedral form of the hexagonal prism, and also hemihedrons of twelve-sided prisms, are of frequent occurrence in Tourmaline. 3. Tetartohedral Forms. Tetartohedral forms are true hemihedral, if the rhombohedron under which they occur, is taken as the type of the crystal ; but referred to the hexagonal system, as is conveniently done in calcu lations, they are tetartohedral forms, or contain only one-fourth the number of planes occurring under complete symmetry. 1. In one kind of tetartohedrism, the occurring planes are the alternate of those on the angles in f. 136 \u2014 that is, only the alternate r's of one base, and the alternate Z's, at the other. A form of this kind consists of six planes, and being oblique, is a kind of irregular rhombohedron. It is found in Titanic Iron, and is called rhombo hedral tetartohedrism. 2. In a second kind \u2014 the trapezohedral tetartohedrism of Nau mann, (also gyroidal), \u2014 the occurring planes are the alternate r's at both bases, (f. 137), (or the alternate Z's). It is observed in Quartz. (See under that species).' 3. There is also a third kind, in which the opposite extremities of a rhombohedrally modified prism are unlike in their modifica tions, as seen in Tourmaline. It is an example of hemimorphic tetartohedrism. II. LAW OF NUMERICAL PROPORTION, IN THE MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. This law gives a mathematical basis to the science, adding to symmetry of arrangement a numerical relation in the position of the planes. It is as follows : The position of planes is related in some simple ratio to the relative lengths of the axes of a ciystal. For example. \u2014 In a cube the axes are equal. A plane on an edge, if extended to meet the axes, would cut. two of these axes at some distance from the centre of the crystal. Now this distance for these axes will either be as 1 : 1, (i, f. 17), that is, a ratio of equality -^a truncating plane ; or a ratio of 1 : 2, (like v'2, f. 32, 33), 1 : 3, (f. 34), 2 : 3, or some other simple ratio. There is no hap hazard scattering of faces, but a complete subserviency to this sim ple law. If the axes are unequal, as in a trimetric form, then the ratio is of the same character, except that the relative lengths of the axes come into the consideration. Thus if a, b, are the axes, the ratios will be la : lb, (17, f. 103, or li, f. 112), or la : 2b, la : Sb. and so on. To\" explain more precisely, let AA, RB, CC, f. 138, be three axes crossing at right angles, as in the monometric. dimetric, and trimetric systems; a, b, c, may stand for the halves of these axes, or for ' AS, BS, CS, respectively. All planes of a crystal meet (or will meet if extended) one, two. or"], [58, "50 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. three of these axes. A plane may pass through A, and be.paral lel to BB, CC, or through B, and be parallel to A A, CC ; or through C, and be parallel to A A, BB. Such planes meet one axis, at a distance 1, A- nr.A +Ur. a-anlir Cat Q Tl 1aTfiTllt.fi distAffCe. and the others only at an infinite distance, which is equivalent to being parallel to them. Hence the expression 1 : oo : oo describes, in a general manner, the position of such planes ; and it becomes more spe cial by adding the letters marking the par ticular axes that are meant in each case, as la : oob : \u0153c, when parallel to b and c, cca : <xb : lc, when parallel to a and b, etc. The faces of a cube, square prism, and rectan gular prism, are of this kind. See also \u00a35. Again, a plane may pass through the points B and C, and be par allel to AA', or through A and C, and be parallel to BB', or through A and B, and be parallel to CC. Such planes meet two axes at a distance 1, and are parallel to the third ; and hence 1 : 1 : oo is a general expression for them , (that is, for the first case, when the plane is parallel to AA, lb : lc : cost, or what is the same, cost : lb : lc ; and so for the others). Or the plane which is parallel to AA, and cuts BB' and CC, may meet BB' at a distance from the centre, equal to 2b (=2BS) while it. meets CC at the distance lc, (=1CS). Then the expression \u0153a:2b: lc indicates the plane. If the ratio of b : c equals 3 : 1 instead of 2 : 1, the expression becomes cost : Sb : lc. In the same manner, Sa : oab : lc, would imply that the plane is parallel to BB', and meets AA at a distance Sa, while CC is met at a distance lc. Again, if the plane passes through the points A, B, C, it has the parameters la:lb: lc ; or if a, b, c, are equal, it becomes 1:1:1. But if A be removed to twice its distance from S, then the ratio would be 2a: lb: lc ; or if B be removed to twice its distance from S, the ratio would be la :2b: lc.' or if both A and C be so removed, it would be 2a : lb : 2c. Thus, in all cases, what ever the position of the plane, the ratio admits of being expressed in simple numbers. The planes may not actually meet the axes, but would meet them in each case, (when not parallel to them), if the plane and the axes were extended ; and thus meeting them, the ratios of the parameters would be as indicated ; for these ratios, for a plane of given inclination, are the same, whether the intersections are nearer to, or farther from S, on the principle that a line paral lel to the base of a triangle cuts the sides proportionally. ma:nb: rc is a general expression for all planes, in which ra, n, r, may have any value, from unit to infinity. Figure 106 shows the relations to the axes ofthe planes 1. and 2. off. 105. Figure 109 is made up of the planes of f. 108, and"], [59, "51 MODDJICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. has the axes la :1b: 2c, the octahedron within being the fundamen tal octahedron, with the ratio la :1b: lc. Figure 111 corresponds to the planes 22 of f. 110, and has the axes 2\u00ab : IJ : 2c. In f. 100, the inner prism has the ratio co\u0153 : lb : lc ; i% i'i is the form 22 of \u00a3 101, having the ratio cost :1b :2c ; and i~2 ii is the form H of f. 102, having the ratio cost: 2b : lc, as tbe drawing of the axes showfc. The annexed figure (f. 139) will further aid in elucidating the principle above stated. It repre sents a rhombic prism with three planes on its basal edges; and for further illustration there are four planes on the angle to the right, be sides two vertical planes, (the corres ponding planes on the left side are not indicated). Within the rhombic prism there are the three axes, stst', bo', cc', crossing at S, the halves of which axes we call st, b, c, as above ; b is the shorter lateral axis, and c the longer. 1. It is obvious that the vertical planes of the rhombic prism meet two of the lateral axes at the distance lb, lc, and are parallel to the vertical axis. Hence the expression for them is cost : lb : lc. 2. The terminal plane is parallel to the lateral axes, and meets only the vertical ; or what is equivalent, it corresponds in position to the plane of the lateral axes, in which the vertical axis is zero. Hence it is designated la: cob: <x>c ; or 0a:lb: lc. 3. The plane ii is parallel to a, the vertical axis, and also to b, the shorter lateral axis, and meets the axis c. Hence the expres sion cost : \u0153b : lc. The parallelism to bb' is apparent in the fact that the upper and lower edges of the plane are parallel to this same axis bb'. 4. Consider next, 1, 2, which are planes of as many octahe drons. These planes are inclined towards the three axes ; and being on the edges of the rhombic prism, they have the same ratio for the lateral axes as that prism, that is, lb : lc, and they differ in the length of the vertical axis, towards which they vary in inclina tion. From b, c (which are connected by a dotted line) lines are drawn to points in the vertical axis ; viz, to \\a, a, 2a ; \\a bisects the axis a; a is the extremity of the axis ; and 2st is at double the distance of st from*!?. Hence of these triangular planes, the plane \\abc=\\a:lb: lc; abc=a:b: c; 2abc=2a-/b:c. These three planes correspond to the three planes on the left basal edge of the prism, being parallel to them. So, also, the three triangular planes having be' at base,"], [60, "52 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. and \\a, a, 2a, respectively as the apices, correspond to the three planes on the other basal edge. Hence the expressions for the planes are. For i, \\a : lb : lc. 1, 1st : lb : lc. 2, 2st : lb : lc. All those forms which have for the lateral axes the ratio of unity, are described as belonging to the fundamental series. 5. Take next the planes $i, It, 27. These planes are all parallel to the shorter lateral axis bb', because their mutual intersections, as well as the intersection of the last with it, are parallel to this axis, for all are horizontal. The line nn is drawn through the extremity of the axis cd, parallel to bb1; and parallel to nn or bb' we draw oo, pp, qq, through \\a, a, 2a; and from nn we run parallel lines to oo, pp, qq. The planes nnoo, nnpp, nnqq, are parallel to the axis b, and each consequently corresponds to a plane of the same series with 17, 27 ; moreover they are respectively parallel to li, 2i, and therefore represent these particular planes, 27 being parallel to nnqq, 11 to nnpp, \\i to nnoo. The expressions for the planes (horizontal prisms or domes) are therefore, For \\a : ooj : lc. 15, 1st : oo& : lc. 25, 2st : coj : lc. The fact of parallelism to these particular planes, in an actual crystal, would be shown, in this as in other cases, by a measure ment of the inclinations of these faces. Calculation, the axes being given, would afford the inclination to the plane of the lateral axes of the planes nnoo, nnpp, etc., and the correspondence with the ob served inclinations would prove the identity ; or from the observed inclination, the position of the plane nnoo could be determined, or what is equivalent, the length of the vertical axis. But this parallelism of the planes, in the figure, is obvious, from the parallelism of certain lines. The planes nnpp and abc', which have the same vertical axis, meet in the line ac', and this line is parallel to np. Moreover, a plane ah'd has the same intersection with nnpp. Consequently, the mutual inclinations of the planes ale', nnpp, ab'cl, will be parallel to one another. Now abd is the plane 1 ; and ab'd another 1 on the back side of the crystal, meet ing 17. And if 17 corresponds to nnpp, it must make parallel inter sections with the two planes 1, which, in fact, it does. There is the same evidence that and 27, are planes corresponding to nnoo and nnqq, as above represented. 6. There remain the planes 2g and ii. We extend the axis bb' to twice the distance bS, (to 2b) ; then connect 2b with d, and both with 2a. The plane thus outlined has the vertical axis 2a, one lateral 2b, the other lc ; and consequently is expressed by 2a :2b: lc ; and this is the plane 22."], [61, "MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS.- 53 The triangular plane 2a 2b d intersects nnqq, in the line d 2a ; and so also does the plane 2st b d. The same course of reasoning as the above, shows that the intersections of nnqq or 27 with 2 abd or 2, must be parallel. Consequently, if 22 corresponds to 2st 25 c', it must make parallel intersections with 2 and 27, which it does. The same parallelism would happen, whatever the length of the axis b, and the above reasoning only determines the vertical axis. That the lateral axis b is, in this case, 2b, is shown by a correspondence between calculation and measurement. The plane ti, is parallel to the vertical axis, but not to either of the lateral axes. By doubling bS, extending it to 2b, and connecting 2b with c', we have the position of the plane, it corresponding to xst : 2b : lc. The intersection of the plane 2a 2b d with a vertical plane passing through 2b d, would be parallel to 2b d, and therefore horizontal, (in a right prism). Hence the intersection of 22 with 2,' if 22 corresponds to 2a2bd, should be horizontal or parallel to 2b d; and as it is thus parallel and horizontal, 2b is correct for that plane. Zones. \u2014 a. Oblique or Transverse [Zones. \u2014 In f. 140, AA'(a), BB'(b), CC'(c), are the three axes of a crystal. By connecting the extremities of these axes, the plane ABC is formed, which corresponds to a ratio of equality for the axes \u2014 that is, la :1b : lc. Make CD, DE, each equal OC ; and connect A and B with D and K Then the planes ABC, ABD, ABE, are alike in the ratio of the axes a and b, but differ in the axis c, they cor-"], [62, "54 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. responding respectively to la : lb : lc, la : lb : 2c, la : lb : 3c, CD being equal to 20 C, and OF to SOC. So there may be any number of planes, in which the axis c shall increase until it reaches infinity ; and, in this last case, the plane will be parallel to the axis c, as ABUV. Referring all these planes to the octahedron of the figure, the fundamental octahedron, they replace the edge AB at different inclinations, and all are alike in having the inter- section with the face ABC,paralUl to the edge AB, or to the edge of the vertical section through the axis 5. Hence flows the following law : I. All planes, whose intersections with am, octahedral plane are parallel to the edge AB, in that octahedron, have the same ratio of atob; or if parallel to the edge A C, they have the same ratio of a to c. If the octahedron, instead of being the fundamental octahedron, is that expressed by the ratio 2a : lb : lc, which differs from the fundamental octahedron in having the vertical axis twice as long, the ratio still holds ; and the planes, if making parallel intersec tions to AB, would be 2a : lb : lc, 2a : lb : 2c, 2a : lb : 3c, and so on to 2a : lb: <xc, the last, the truncating plane, or that parallel to axis c. Or if they make parallel intersections to AC, so that the ratio a to c is constant, they may be 2st : lb : lc, 2a : 2b : lc, 2a : Sb : lc, and so on to 2a :<xb : lc, in which the last is parallel to the axis b. Making 6^ half of OC, and connecting A and B with F, we have the plane AFB corresponding to 1st : 15 : \\c ; or making OI a quarter of OC, we have AIB, corresponding to 1st : lb : \\c ; and so till c becomes zero, when the plane is identical with the axial plane ABA'B', or is a plane parallel to it, and its ratio is la :1b : Oc. This last plane is a lateral plane of a rectangular or square prism. There is thus a zone of planes indicated, lying between 1st : 15 Oc, on one side, and 1st : 15 : Oc, on the other \u2014 that is, in the trimetric system for example, between a vertical plane parallel to axis 5 and its opposite. In like manner, there is another zone parallel to the edge AC, between la : 05 : lc, on one side, and 1st : 05 : lc, on the opposite, or between the other vertical plane of a rectangular prism and its opposite. And whatever the length of the axes of the octahedron, each edge may have its corresponding zone of planes. In the annexed figure, (f. 141), one of the zones of planes is represented : it lies between ii, (the smaller lateral plane of a rectangular prism), and its opposite ; it is the same"], [63, "MODDJICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. 55 illustrated in the preceding figure, (f. 140), 1\u00a7 being plane ABE; l2,ABD; 1, plane ABC; 2a, plane ABF; 44,plane A BI. 17 is the horizontal prism at the middle of the zone. The fraction in 1st : 15 : \\c, is avoided by doubling all the terms, making 2a : 25 : lc, in which there is the same ratio for the axes. The plane GCH, (f. 140), is drawn to correspond to the expres sion 2st : 25 : lc, OC being equal to 2a, (or 20A), and OH to 25, (or 2 OB); and it is seen that GCH and AFB are parallel planes in the figure, and therefore identical. So, in place of 1st : 15 : \\c, we may write ia : 45 : lc, this being equivalent to 1st : 15 : Jc, the difference being that, while 5 is the unit axis in one, c is so in the other, and this difference is to be carefully observed. These planes on the octahedron, in \u00a3 140, replace the angle C, and have the intersection with A CB parallel to AB. Hence the above law extends not only to planes about the edge AB, with parallel intersections, but to all planes making intersections parallel to the edge ; and tbe same as to edge A C. The expression 1st : 15 : Oc, is equivalent to cost : <x5 : lc, (a re sult of dividing each term by 0) ; and this last is the one usually employed for such vertical planes. The zone (B) making intersections parallel to the edge AB, or the brachydiagonal section, in the octahedron 1st : 15 : lc, will hence be, beginning with 17, and passing to ii, (f. 141), 1 : 1 : co . . 1:1:3. . -1:1:2.. 1:1:1. .l:l:J..l:l:i.. 1:1:0; or the equivalent, 1 : 1 : 00 . . 1:1:3. .1:1:2. .1:1:1.. 2:2:1.. 4:4:1. . 00 : 00 : 1. The latter is the form adopted.

When ra becomes infinite, the two zones form a single series of vertical prisms, as for example, od:1:oo..oo:1:3..c<o:1:2.. c\u00a9:1:1.. co:2:l..co:4:l . . 00 : co : 1. When axis 5 is infinite, the zone B becomes a verti cal series of horizontal planes parallel to axis 5 : and when axis c is infinite, the zone C becomes a similar vertical series, parallel to axis c. The basal plane falls into each of these series. These ver tical zones are two out of the many series that may exist in crystals. 5. Vertical Zones. \u2014 The planes and abc, in \u00a3 139, are parts of a vertical series having intersections parallel to 5c, and varying in the vertical axis. This series, as the vertical axis diminishes, finally terminates in the top plane 0\u0153 : 15 : lc ; and as it increases, ends"], [64, "56 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY; in the vertical plane cost : 15 : lc, or the vertical plane i. This is a zeme of planes, having the general expression ma :1b : lc ; it includes the terminal plane, and the faces \u00a3, 1, 2,, i. The planes 2i and ii are in another zone. The fact of a hori zontal intersection between them is proved as already explained, and it follows that all planes having, in like manner, the ratio for the lateral axes 25 : lc, will have Horizontal intersections. This series is the zone m : 2 : 1, (or ma : 25 : lc.) It follows also, that whatever the ratio of 5 to c, all planes of like ratio will have horizontal intersections, (the planes of the axes 5 : c being assumed to be horizontal), and consequently there will be as many vertical zones as there may be values ofb:e. Again, the planes \\i 15, 25, ii (f. 139) are in a similar zone paral lel to axis 5, in which, therefore, 5=oo ; the general expression is m : co : 1, (or nut : oo5 : lc). As the vertical axis increases, ra in creases, and when ra=co, the plane is vertical, nnoo, nnpp, nnqq, nnyy, illustrates the series; the last corresponds to the plane ii.. A similar series, on the other edge and solid angle of the rhombic prism, would have the general expression m : 1 : co, (or ma : lb : cdc.) Hence, the second law : \u2014 II. Planes which have their mutual intersections honzcmtal, {the plane ofthe lateral axes being horizontal), are identical in the ratio between their lateral axes ; and the converse. A tabular view of these vertical zones is here presented. The 0 stands for the basal plane, in which each zone terminates above. The first column corresponds to a vertical zone parallel to axis c ; the second, to other zones with 15 : nc as the ratio of the lateral axes, in whicli n has a different value for each possible zone ; the third, for the fundamental series, in which the ratio of the lateral axes is 15 : lc ; the fourth, for other zones having the ratio of the lateral axes nb : lc ; the fifth, for the zone parallel to axis 5. We have used / for any fraction less than a unit, m and n for numbers greater than a unit. Expressions for planes in the different Crystallographic Sys tems. \u2014 The several systems of crystallization, since they differ in their axes, require each some peculiarity in the expressions used for their planes. In the Monometric system, as the axes are all equal, there is correctly no vertical axis, and a=b=c.

In the Dimetric system, the vertical is a varying axis; but 5=c. The vertical faces of the prism (f. 2) will be expressed by the same symbol as the faces of the cube, oo : 1 : oo ; the first term being considered here and elsewhere as referring to the axis a. The ter- minal plane is more conveniently considered as having the vertical axis reduced to zero, (0), as above illustrated. A prism diagonal with the prism just alluded to (or that truncating its edges, f. 77) will have the ratio co : 1 : 1. Planes parallel to either axis b or c, (on the basal edges, as in f. 83), will have alike the general expres- sion, m : co : 1. In the Trimetric system, the lateral axes differ from one another, as well as from the vertical. Hence one vertical face ofthe rect- angular prism (f. 3) has the expression co : lb : <x-c, and the other co : co5 : lc. This expression is made more concise by using in place of the letters, the mark - for the longer lateral axis, and - for the shorter. Thus, considering 5 shorter than c, the expression oo : 15 : coc becomes oo : T : 5b \u25a0 and co : aob : lc, becomes oo : oo : l, which last means simply that the plane is parallel to the shorter lateral axis, this being infinite, (co). So in all other cases, the gen- eral formula ma : nb : re, becomes ra : \u00ab : r, signifying that the plane has for its parameters, ra times the vertical axis, n times the shorter lateral, and r times the longer lateral, whatever in any case may be the values of m, n, r. The lateral planes of the rhombic prism have the ratio oo : 1 : 1. In the Monoclinic system, one of the lateral axes is inclined to the vertical, and the other not. The expression ma : nb : re, in this system, is abbreviated by using an accent for the inclined axis ; thus the ratio becomes ra : n : r. In the prism, f. 5, the right hand lateral plane has the expression co : co : 1 ; and the front plane, the expression co : i : oo ; while the planes on the edges, or the lateral plane of 6, have the ratio oo : 1 : 1, the same as for the right rhombic prism. Again, the planes on the angles of f. 114, as they are parallel to the clinodiagonal, come under the general ex- pression m : co : 1. Owing to the inclination of the vertical axis, the planes in front, above the plane of the axes BB, CC, differ from those below ; and the two are distinguished by the signs for plus and minus, as in f. 112, 113. The Triclinic and Hexagonal systems will be the subject of remarks on a following page. System of Notation. \u2014 The ratios above given are inconveniently long for use in the descriptions of crystals, and have been abbrevi- ated by Naumann. In all cases, one of the last two terms in these ratios may be a unit. Thus the ratio 6 : 3 : 2 is equal to 3 : f : 1. We may therefore indicate the ratio of 5 to c by simply a single 8"], [66, "58 CRYST ALLOGkAPHYa figure. Thus, \u00a7, in this case, is as explicit as f : 1, when we wish only the general expression. Hence, 3 : f would express accu rately the plane. Naumann writes the 3 (or number referring to the vertical axis) before a P, and the other figure after, thus, 3P\u00a7 ; se also oo_Poo ; ooP, (for ooPl, the unit being implied) ; 3P, (for 3P1, as in the last) ; and generally mPn, for any plane. In the mono metric system, the letter O, (initial of Octahedron), is adopted^ in place of P. The letter has no special meaning, and the expression is as explicit and more concise, when written without it, thus, 3-f , istead of 3P|; 3 instead of SP; co-go, instead of coPoo ; rara, instead of mPn, In some cases, however, the use of the letter is convenient, and especially for hemihedral crystals. In tlie Triinrtrif system, the expressions become \u0153 : 5>, corres ponding to oo : oo : 1 ; 3-a, corresponding to 3 : a : 1 ; m-n for m : 1 : n, or m-n, for m : \u00bb : 1. Naumann writes mpn, or m7jn. It is preferable to place the long or short mark over the figure refer ring to the longer or shorter, respectively, of the lateral axes, as iiiPn, or mPn. In the Moiwclinic system, ra : 1 : n becomes m-n, (or mPn) ; and ra : \u00bb : 1, becomes m-n(m.Pn). Tlie symbol for a plane is used for the whole form whicli the planes of a kind constitute. Tims the general symbol for a plane ofthe regular octahedron (O or 1) is used to designate the octahe dron ; the general symbol of a face of the cube, (zdOca, or oo-co), indicates the cube as a whole. Tlie Zones alluded to on a preceding page, are well exhibited through these symbols. Thus, if we write I for any number less than a unit, and m and n for any numbers greater, the series in the dimetric and trimetric systems will be as followrs : Dimetrie System. Trimetric System. In the table for the dimetric system, the column 1 is a series of octahedrons ending below in a square prism ; 2, different series of 8-sided pyramids, whh,, one for each possible value of n, and ending below in corresponding 8-sided prisms ; 3, series of octahedrons di agonal to those of column 1, and ending in the diagonal prism.

The table includes a fourth of an upper half of a crystal, the same being repeated in each fourth around. The monoclinic system is similarly presented in the following table : s Column 1 is the orthodiagonal zone, or series parallel to the or thodiagonal; 3, the fundamental series of octahedrons, the ratio of tlie lateral axes being lb : lc, and containing also the fundamental rhombic prism ; 5, the clinodiagonal series ; 2 and 4, zones between the fundamental zone and the orthodiagonal series on one side, and the clinodiagonal on the other, each having its rhombic prism. The middle horizonal line of planes, co-oo, \u0153-n, oo, &c, is a series of vertical prisms ; the planes above it are +- those below are \u2014 , ex cepting in the 5th column, in which those above and below are alike as they are clinodomes, (see page 43). The table comprises a fourth of the crystal, including the parts below as well as those above the middle section. The various secondary planes of crystals often have a general re lation among themselves, which is worthy of more study than it has yet received. Under Humite, figures are given, (taken, with a change in the notation, from a paper by M. Scacchi), which show a remarkable arithmetical progression in the series of planes. Thus in one zone, there are the octahedral planes t3q, f, |, f, |; in another figure, the planes f , f , \u00a7, \\ ; in a third, the series, r\\, T% , rb ii f > i? f) t j an(i other examples of similar character are seen in the same figures. It is evident that the planes of each type be long together in one system and have a mutual dependence.

At other localities there is often a very different, series of planes, many of whicli are pe culiar to the place, or occur only in the combination there ob served. The mutual dependence of the planes is such that they essentially belong together as much as the different parts of a curve of a given equation. It is customary to mention the known com binations of forms of a species, enumerating even those which are mere simplifications of a given type, and giving the whole equal importance. The distinction of the various forms of each species into separate types of de] tendent series remains to be studied out. The fact that the axes of crystals have specific dimensions, is at the basis of the relation by multiples upon which the arrangement of the planes depends. In the monometric system, as the axes are equal, the positions of the planes are independent of any given length. Thus, if we find a plane on an edge of a cube inclined to its face at an angle of 153\u00b0 26', as Rb on ba, (f. 142), the ratio of \u201e Ph to Pa (equivalent to the ratio of the axes of the plane ab) will be found to be 1 : 2, in dicating that the plane has the ratio 1 : 2 : \u0153. In the triangle Pba, the angle Pah =153\u00b0 26' \u2014 90\u00b0=63\u00b0 26' ; and then the ratio P\u00ab(=l) : Pb::B: tan63\u00b026' = l : 2. H- But in the dimetric and other systems, the inclinations of the planes afford the ratios not simply of ra : n, as in the monometric system, but of ma : nb, (or ma : n, making 5=1), etc., the lengths of one or more of the axes being included in the ratio. In deciding upon the planes to be considered those of the fundamental series, in a dimetric or trimetric crystal, and particularly upon the plane that, will give the length of the fundamental vertical axis, or of the lateral axes, we may be, at times, guided by an octahe dral cleavage, in which case the cleavage plane will be the face 1:1: 1, \u2014 or 1:1: oo. In the trimetric system, there is often a ver tical cleavage, parallel to the faces of a rhombic prism, which rhombic prism would be therefore the fundamental prism So : 1 ; 1 ; and when that is the case, the angle of the prism indicates at once the ratio of the lateral axes. If this angle, for example, is 100\u00b0, we have this angle of a rhomb to determine the ratio of the diagonals, (the lateral axes) ; the diagonals divide the rhomb into four right angled triangles, each having angles of 50\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 ; and hence the ratio 5(=1) : c: :P:tan 50\u00b0, which gives the value of c. In the majority of cases, for one or more ofthe axes, some plane"], [69, "61 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS must be empirically assumed to be that based on the ratio of unity ; and in deciding upon which, we may be guided often by finding some plane more frequent than others in occurrence ; or by detecting analogies with some other species ; or by the desirable ness of having such a plane as will give the most simple expres sions for the ratios ofthe other planes, an arbitrary criterion often convenient, rather than correct. We arrive in any case, at a ratio for the axes, upon which the whole structure of .the crystal is based. If, for example, we obtain as the axial ratios of a : b, for a series of planes, 2-4 : 1, 1-2 : 1, 0-6 : 1, it matters little which plane is as sumed as fundamental. If the first, then st=2-4, 5=1 ; and then the planes will be in order, 1 : 1 : op, \\ : 1 : oo, \\ : 1 : oo. But if we take the second as the fundamental one, (as would probably be done), then st=l-2, 5=1, and the ratios for the planes will be 2 : 1 : oo, 1 : 1 : co, J : 1 :\u2022 od. Both indicate the same general relation among the planes. The calculation of the axes in such a case, by plane trigonometry, would be similar to that above. The inclina tion ofthe plane. on the base of a crystal, subtracted from 180\u00b0, (or diminished by 90\u00b0), gives the angles of the triangle P5st, and then working the triangle by the equation, Pa (=1) : P5 : : R : tan Pst5, we have, as the result, a ratio like one of the above. Pursuing the same with another plane as a c, another ratio will be obtained, which is some multiple of the first. In the trimetric and triclinic systems either of the three axes may be called the a rtinil, and authors are not all agreed on this point with regard to particular minerals. So also in the monoclinic sys tem, where there is no cleavage to determine the plane 0P, or that of the lateral axes, this plane must be assumed from analogy or ar bitrarily as the case may be. Still, in comparing the angles of different species, it is necessary to ascertain, by some facts or analo gies, which are actually the homologous axes, as only such are prop erly related. It is convenient to remember that when RPQ is a right angle, the sum of the angles Red, Qac, is 270\u00b0 ; or whatever the angle, RPQ, Rca+Qao=lS0\u00b0+RPQ. If RPQ is 100\u00b0, then Rca+Qac =280\u00b0. Another elementary fact in geometry of frequent use in crystallography is, that the sum of the two angles cPa and caP of the triangle cPa, equals the external angle Rca. So that Rca being known, Pac is found by subtracting aPc, the angle of the edge, from Rca. Plane and spherical trigonometry may be used also for deter mining the axes from any given planes, and for ascertaining the angles from the axes. But the calculations by means of equations derived from analytical geometry are the most complete, and most general in their application ; and to these we now proceed, pre senting more in detail many points barely glanced at in the pre ceding pages."], [70, "62 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY.

CO, or a : b : c, A A', BB', CC being three rectangular axes, each bisected at 0. The plane ABC is similar in its parameters, except that the axis C'O is on the opposite side of 0.

Several of these equations are deducible from the explanations on pages 53 to 56. When co enters into the equation, on reducing it, all the terms not containing co as a coefficient are expunged, a result that follows necessarily, from dividing the whole equation by infinity ; and if co2 occurs, all but the terms containing oo2 are for a like reason dropped. a.

The law holds for the hexagonal system, as well as the mono metric, dimetric, and trimetric. Either face ofthe type-prism in the rectangular systems, maybe taken as the basal ; and the planes of the zones which in this new position become vertical, (or their intersections horizontal), have essentially the same relation. In this case, the angle Us the in clination on the assumed base, and ra is the coefficient of the axis"], [73, "65 Mathematical crystallography. at right angles to this base, which axis becomes for the time the vertical. II. MONOMETRIt: SYSTEM. 1. Inclinations between planes of different forms* 5. In the monometric system, since the axes are equal, (st=5=c=l), the values of ra, n, in equations, stand for the axes. m-n is a general expression for holohedral planes or forms ; \u2014 ~ for inclined hemihedrons, (as in f. 53 to 66), [OIAl for parallel hemibedrons, (as f. 67 to 75). 6. The general equation for the mutual inclination of two planes m-n, m'-n', is n ,-._ '\"\u00bb'' (\u00ab\u00bb'-|-l)+-/\"'' OOS V\u2014 ~ V(TOa(n!-(-l)-|-n2) V(\u00ab'a (n'2+l) +\u00bb'2) 7.

From this table, the inclinations of any form on a face of the cube, octahedron, or dodecahedron, may be calculated. 8.

TRIMETRIC SYSTEM. 1. Inclinations between planes of different forms. 24. In the trimetric system the forms mPn are octahedrons ; that is, for any particular plane mPn on a crystal there will be eight in all, and these extended, produce an octahedron like f. 13. The inclination of a plane mPn, on another m'Pn', may be as certained by means of the general formula, p. 62, by substituting (b being the longer lateral axis) when the forms are m-n and m'-n', ma, nb for a, b. -m'n, n'b, c for a', b', d. m-n and m'-n, ma nc for a c. m' a, b, n'c for a', b', d. m-n and m'-n' ma nc for a c. m'a, n'b c for a', b', d. 25. a.

Combinations in the Trimetric System. 31. On this subject see the general laws on pages 53 to 56, which contain many of the specific cases below. In this system, as in the preceding, forms with a horizontal intersection have n=n. In a rhombic octahedron, mP planes truncating or bevelling the terminal edges have m'=m ; but as one edge is connected with the maerodiagonal, and the other with the brachydiagonal, the planes differ, \u2014 those of the maerodi agonal edge being m-n or m-x, and those of the brachydiagonal m-n or to-x. In the following table, forms are said to be of the same kind,"], [86, "78 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. when connected with the same axis, and consequently having the same mark, w or \u2014 , placed above their signs. m' m 1. m'-n', bev. macrod. terminal edge of m-n , when ) 2. m'-n', bev. brachyd. terminal edge of in' it, when j 3. m'-n', bev. brachyd. terminal edge otm-n, when I 4. m'-n', bev. macrod. terminal edge of m-n , when J n' n Hi' =Hl. 2mm' 5. m\"-\u0153 , repl.

The form m-n completed is a double twelve-sided pyramid or berylloid, (f. 124) ; m and m-2 are double six-sided pyramids or quartzoids, (like f. 122 in form), the series to-2 inter mediate to the series in, (see f. 121); so and x-2 are hexago nal prisms, respectively corresponding to the pyramids. xto, ex cept when ;*=2 represents twelve-sided prisms. mR (equivalent to form Z') stands for rhombohedrons, (R, fig. 126, and other rhombohedrons of the same series). The use of the signs + and - for rhombohedrons and scalenohedrons is explained on page 48. The scalenohedron has the general sign \u00b1\u2014^. Designated with reference to the axis of that rhombohedron from which they are derived, they come under the expression mRn, in which m, equals the semi-axis of mP, and n is a coefficient, which multiplied into to will give the semi-axis of the form mRn. The expression -'\u25a0Z is reduced to the form m'Rn ' by making , m(2\u2014 n) , , tt, to \u2014 \u2014 ', and n' \u2014 , n 2\u2014 \u00bbi' and conversely the latter is reduced to the former by making m\u2014m'n', and n \u2014 \u2014 \u00a3- M'+l- 33. For each mR there is a series of scalenohedrons mRn, corresponding to a replacement of the lateral edges of the rhom bohedron mR, in which n may have any value ; when this value"], [87, "79 Mathematical crystallogra pi i St. is infinite, the form is the prism to\u00c6co, and this is equivalent to x-2, since the prism is necessarily a prism diagonal to the funda mental prism. The latter sign is the one which is commonly used for the prism. The pyramidal hemihedral forms, represented in f. 136, p. 48, have the symbol \\ (^' or rl r or \\ being used according as the planes are to the left or right above. The gyroidal hemihedral forms, analogous to f. 137, p. 48, have the symbol r yUAL) or ] bZZ The corresponding tetartohedral forms have the same symbols, except that 4 is written for 2 ; or else the equivalent \u201e , with r or I prefixed. 1.

All the axial intersections in this system are oblique. As in the trimetric system, the longer lateral axis and the axial section corresponding is called the maerodiagonal, the shorter the brachydi agonal, The fundamental octahedron (f. 119) has only opposite faces similar ; the upper are respectively 1 and 1', and the lower -1 and -1'. The maerodiagonal and brachydiagonal planes may be distin guished by a long or short mark (-or-), as in the trimetric sys tem, and the lower planes from the upper by prefixing a minus ( \u2014 ) to the former (or the reverse). The planes between the macro diagonal and brachydiagonal vertical zones to the right from those to the left, may be distinguished by adding the accents.

Let the mutual inclination of the sectional planes of the fundamental form at their intersections in the axes a, b, c, be rep resented respectively by A, B, C ; and the inclination of the axes by a, /3, y : that is, the inclination of a on b, by y, a on c, by /?, b on c, by a. Let also the inclinations of a face of the fundamental octahedron, on the maerodiagonal, brachydiagonal, and basal sec tions be represented by X, Y, Z, respectively, and finally the incli nations of the edge Xonabyf* Y on a by * Z on b by <r \" 5 \" v \" C \" p \" C \" T M-+v+y=*+p+/S=a'+r+a=180o. b.

If the plane in the basal section is considered the base, and the vertical solid angle of the octahedron the vertex, of one of these pyramids, its lateral interfacial angles are identical with the angles X, Y, A ; and since the terminal edges are X, Y and the axis a, the plane angles at the summit are X: Y, X : a, and Y : a, of which, the last two angles equal respectively and *. If we make the vertex A a centre, and describe with any given radius an arc on each of the faces, a spherical triangle is formed, whose an gles equal the inclinations of the faces of the pyramid, viz, X, Y, A, and whose sides are measured by the plane angles at the vertex, two of which are f*. and *. In this spherical triangle, if the angles A, /a, and * are given, (that is, two sides, p. and *, and the included angle A), the angles X and Y are readily determined by Napier's theorem. 1.

When the angles X and Y in any particular form are de sired, it will be necessary to obtain the values of <a and * for that form, and with these values and the angle A, the desired angle may be obtained by the above equations. In a similar manner, Y and Z, and X and Z, may be known from r and f, and <s and v. If X and Y are determined, and v and f are known, Z may be obtained by the equation, Cos Z-\u2014 \u2014 r sin (X \u2014 V) : or cos Z=-. \u2014 : sin ( Y \u2014 Z), sinif v T> ' sini/* v ' in which +- is an angle to be determined by the equation, Cot += cos v tan 13; or cos -4= cos f tan C.

In consequence of the parallelism of the intersections of o', a' and o\", the planes o' replace the edges C(fig. 49) of the hemi-hexoctahedron o\", and are inclined on the longest edge B, (f. 74) ; and therefore from \u00a7 3, re'=- i \u2014'- Sub- (mn \u2014 1 mn+m'(m \u2014 n')m stituting 4 for m, and 2 for re, and reducing the equation, we obtain n'=im'.

Because also o'\u00bb forms parallel intersections with M and a', (2), o\"=4-2. o', o\", o'\", form parallel edges between M and a, and the same are parallel with e, and they are, therefore, of the general form m-m. Consequently, from the above, o'=2-2. As the mutual intersections of a\", olv, o'\", are parallel to one another, and also to the normal section, m'=m, and since o'v=4-2, o'\"=4-4, and a\"=4. The planes ov replace the basal angles ofthe pyramid 1, and their edges of inter section with the same a are parallel, or in other words, a truncates edge Y of the form o\" (m-n); therefore, (\u00a7 22, a, 1), m(n+l)=2m'n; or since m'=l, m(re-f-l)=2n. Again, since o\" replaces the edges between e (l-oo) and o', (2-2), m(re \u2014 l)=n, (\u00a7 3, a, 2). Therefore, m(re-fl)=2m(re\u2014 1) .-. re=3 and o'=|-3. Since the intersections of oT and o\" are horizontal, re'=n, and consequently o\"=3-3. To determine o' by measurement, we measure the angle o' : M, from which by sub tracting 90\u00b0, we obtain \\T.

Hence to determine m for any plane, we have only to measure the angle between the plane and a, and subtract 90\u00b0 ; this gives \\TJ, and then the equation 2m \u2014 1=2'34 tan \\U, gives m.

Consequently, a = l-\u00bb, (\u00a753). The intersection of o'(m-n) with e (1) is parallel to the clinodiagonal edge of octahedron 1, consequently n=m (\u00a7 53 5), and o'=.m-m. Again, o' forms parallel intersections with a(l - oo) and ils, (oo), and therefore its sign is of the general m m form m -\u2022 But from the above, n=m, and consequently \u00bb\u00ab= from m \u2014 1 * J m \u2014 1 , which we find m=2, and o=2-2. The edge o' : a' (m'-oo ) is parallel to the orthodiagonal edge of o' (2-2) conse quently m=2, (\u00a7 53, 1, 6), and a'=2-oo. The intersection of o' (2-2) with e' (oo-\u00bbi), is parallel to the basal section of 2-2, (apparent in the crystal, though not in the figure, a perspective representation of it); hence re'=2, (\u00a7 53, 1, a), and t'=oo-2. Thus all the expressions for the planes of this crystal have been determined with out a measurement. If the intersection of o' with M were not apparent in the crystal, it would be necessary first to determine e' by measuring the interfacial an gles M : e and e' : e ; these angles 136\u00b0 35' and 117\u00b0 51' diminished by 90\u00b0 give the angles X in the two forms M ( go) and e', ( cdA') ; and then, since tan 46\u00b0 35'=2 tan 27\u00b0 51', it follows that m'=2 and e'=\u00b0o - 2. Thence since the intersection of o' with e' is parallel to the basal section of o', {m-m), o'=2-2, (\u00a7 53, 1, a), as before found. The same might have been similarly determined by measuring the inclina tion of 1 on a and a'. For the calculation of the dimensions and angles of the crystal we have as data, go-qo : 1-00=140\u00b0 40', oo-co ; \u2014 l-oo =126\u00b0 8', oo-oo : oo=136\u00b0 35'. 180\u00b0\u2014 140\u00b0 40'=39\u00b0 20'=,,', 180\u00b0\u2014 126\u00b0 8' =53\u00b0 52'=,,, 136\u00b0 35'\u2014 90\u00b0=46\u00b0 35'=A'inoo.

In the projection of crystals, the eye is supposed to be at an infinite distance, so that the rays of light fall from it on the crystal in parallel lines ; and not diverging as in ordinary landscape perspective. If parallel lines were drawn from the ver- tices of the solid angles of a crystal, to a board placed behind it, and the points thus formed on the board were connected by straight lines, as in the crystal, a re- presentation of the crystal would be formed, constructed according to the mode of projection employed in crystallography. The plane on which the crystal is projected, is termed the plane of projection. This plane may be at right angles with the ver- tical axis, may pass through the vertical axis, or may intersect it at an oblique angle. These different positions give rise, respectively, to the horizontal, vertical, and oblique projections. The rays of light may fall perpendicularly on the plane of projection, or may be obliquely inclined to it ; in the former case the projection is termed ortho- graphic, in the second clinographic. In the horizontal position of the plane of pro- jection, the projection is always orthographic. In the other positions, it may be either orthographic or clinographic. It has been usual to give the plane of projection an oblique position, and to use the orthographic mode of projection. Itis however preferable to employ the vertical position and clinographic projection, and this method is elucidated in the following pages. The projection of the axes of a crystal, is the first step preliminary to the projec- tion of the crystal itself. It will be more convenient to illustrate first the projec- tion of the axes in the monometric system, which are equal and intersect at right angles. The projection of the axes in the other cases, may be obtained by varying the lengths of the projected monometric axes, and also, when oblique their inch nations. Monometric System.\u2014 When the eye is directly in front of a faee of a cube neither the sides nor top of the crystal are visible, nor the secondary planes that'mav be situated on the intermediate edges. On turning the crystal a few degrees from right to left, a side lateral plane is brought in view, and by elevating the eye slightly the 153 terminal plane becomes apparent. Half the planes on tne crystal are now visible, and consequently this is a convenient position for projecting it. In the following demonstration, the angle of revolution is designated t, and the angle of the elevation of the eye.t.

It is usual to adopt such a revolution and such an elevation of the eye as may be expressed by a simple ratio between the projected axes. Let us designate the ratio between the two axes as projected after the revolution alluded to (MN : MH) by 1 : r ; and the ratio of b'N to MN by 1 : s. Now the character of the view will vary with the values assumed for r and s. Suppose r to equal 3 and s to equal 2, then proceed as follows : Draw two lines AA', H'H (f.154) intersecting one another at right angles. Make MH=MH' =6. Divide HH' into r parts, and through the points, N, N', thus determined, draw perpen diculars to HH'. On the left hand vertical, set 154 off, below H', a part H'R, equal to -6=- H'M and from R draw RM, and extend the same to the vertical N'. B'B is the projection of the front horizontal axis. Draw BS parallel with MH' and connect S, M. From the point T in which SM intersects BN, draw TC parallel with MH. A line (CC) drawn from C through M, and extended to the left vertical, is the projection ofthe side hori zontal axis. Lay off ou the right vertical, a part HQ equal to -MH, and make MA=MA'=MQ ; AA' is the vertical axis. r The values of r and s commonly taken, are r=3, s=2, in which case, ,1=18\u00b0 26', andt = 9\u00b0 28'. It is not unusual to give s the value of 3, in which case \u00a3=6\u00b0 20'. This affords a narrower terminal plane. The angle t! is obtained by the equation cot d=r, the angle e by the equation cot \u00a3=r s. The regular octahedron may now be drawn, by connecting the extremi ties of the horizontal axes, and then uniting them by right lines with the points A, A', as in f. 155. If lines be drawn through the points B and B', parallel with C C, and through C, C, parallel with the axis BB', a plane figure abed is formed, which is a hori- zontal section of the cube. Through the points a, b, c, d, draw lines piirallel with the vertical axis AA', and extend them each side of these points, to a distance equal to the vertical semiaxis MA. By con necting the upper and also the lower extremities of these perpendiculars by lines parallel with the lines ab, be, cd, da, the figure will represent a cube. The cube may .also be projected by drawing lines from Mto the centre of each edge of the octahedron, and then extending these lines to double their length. Then extremities are the vertices of the angles of the cube. It is convenient to have at hand an accurate figure of a cube drawn on a large scale, as it may readily be used by methods explained beyond for making figures ot the type prisms of either of the other systems. Such a figure may be made as above explained It mav also be constructed with a graduated arc, or a scale oi signs as follows. Draw two lines as AA' and HH, f. 154, crossing at right angles ; .draw a. lineCC, making an angle 3\u00b0 11' with H'H, and BB', making an angle 26 34, with H'H, each crossing AA' in M. Then, M being the centre of each axis, make AA' 4i inches in length, CC 4^ inches, BB 1* inches. From these axes the cube is"], [108, "100 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. readily constructed. The axes are more exactly, AA' 4'245 in., CC 4-038 in., BB' 1,500 'in. Dimetric System. \u2014 In the dimetric system the vertical axis may be made to cor respond to the dimensions in a dimetric crystal, by laying off on MA and MA', (taken as units), extended if necessary, a line equal to a-i-b; or if 6, the horizontal axis of the prism =1, the line should equal a (the vertical axis) simply. After deter mining thus the points A\", A'\", the dimetric octahedron may be formed in the same manner as the regular octahedron above described, except the points A\", A'\" should be substituted for A, A'. The method of describing the cube, already ex plained, may be employed also for the right square prism. Another right square prism may be represented by drawing lines parallel with the vertical axis, through the extremities of the horizontal axes, making them equal to the vertical axis, and uniting their extremities. Also another square octahedron may be constructed by connecting the points a, b, c, d, with the extremities of the vertical axis. Trimetric System. \u2014 The monometric axes may be adapted to trimetric forms as follows: if the axis 6=1, lay off MA\" and MA'\" equal to a, andMC\", MC\" equal to c: if c=l, make MB\", MB'\", equal to 6. By connecting the extremities of the axes, as already explained, the rhombic octahedron may be constructed. The rectangular prism may be projected in the same manner as the cube ; the rhombic prism in the same man ner as the second square prism just described ; and the rectangular octahedron in the same manner as the second dimetric octahedron explained in the last section. In changing a figure of a cube (in which the edges =1) to a square or rectangu lar prism oo- oo, it is only necessary to shorten or lengthen the edges to correspond with the axes of the new prism. Monoclinic System. \u2014 The axes a and 6 in the monoclinic system are inclined to one another at an oblique angle=y. To pro ject this inclination, and thus adapt the mono metric axes to a monoclinic form, lay off on the axis MA, Ma= MA cos y, and on the axis BB' (before or behind M, according as the inclina tion of 6 on a, in front, is acute or obtuse) M6=MBXsin y. From the points 6 and a, draw lines parallel respectively with the axes AA' and BB', and from their intersection D', draw through M, D'D, making MD=MD'. The line DD' is the clinodiagonal and the lines AA, CC, DD' represent the axes in a monoclinic solid in which a=6=c=l. The points a and 6 and the position of the axis DD' will vary with the angle y. The relative values of the axes may be given them as above explained ; that is, if 6=1, lay off in the direction of MA and MA' a line equal to a, and in the direction of MC and MC a line equal to c, <fcc. 156 Thermit rhomboidal prism may be projected in the same manner as the cube or right rectangular prism, and the oblique rhombic prism, in the same manner as the right rhombic prism. Diclinic System.*\u2014 In the diclinic system, the vertical section through the hori zontal axes intersect one another at right angles, as in the preceding system but the inclination of a to 6 (y) and a to c (0) are each oblique. This obliquity may be given the monometric axes as follows : Lay off on MA, (f. 156), Ma=MAXcos y and on the axis BB', (brachydiagonal), M6=MB'Xsin y. By completing the paral lelogram Ma D'6, the point D' is determined. Make MD=MD' \u25a0 DD' is the pro jected brachydiagonal. Again lay off on MA, Ma'=MAXeos 0, and on MC, to the left, Mc=MC Xsin 0. Draw lines from a' and c parallel to MC and MA \u25a0 E' the intersection of these lines, is one extremity of the maerodiagonal ; and the 'lineE'E * The diclinic system differs from the triclinic in having only two of the axial intersections oblique instead of the three. As no example of it has been observed among minerals, and the forms are as well described in the triclinic system, it was not treated of in the earlier part of the work."], [109, "101 DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. in whicli ME=ME', is the maerodiagonal. AA', DD'.EE' are the axes in a diclinic form, in which the axes are equal. From the observations on the preceding systems of crystallization, the method to be employed in giving the axes their relative values in a particular diclinic form, is sufficiently obvious. The construction of the oblique rectangular prism is analogous to that of the cube. Triclinic System. \u2014 The vertical sections through the horizontal axes in the triclinic system are obliquely inclined ; also the inclination of the axis a to each axis 6 and c, is oblique. In the adaptation of the monometric axes to the triclinic forms, it is therefore necessary, in the first place, to give the requisite obliquity to the mutual inclination ofthe vertical sections, and afterwards to adapt the horizontal axes, as in the diclinic system. The inclination of these sections we may designate A, and as heretofore, the angle between a and 6, y, and a and c, 0. BB' is the analogue of the brachydiagonal, and CC of the maerodiagonal. An oblique inclination may be given the vertical sections, by varying the position of either of these sections. Permitting the brachydiagonal section ABA'B' to remain unaltered, we may vary the other section as follows : Lay off on MB,M6'=MBXcos A, and on the axis C'C, (to the right or left of M, according as the acute angle A is to the right or left), Mc=MCX sin A; completing the parallelogram M6' Dc, and drawing the diagonal MD, extending the same to D' so as to make MD'=MD, we obtain the line DD'; the vertical section passing through this line is the correct macrodiagonal section. The inclination of a to the new ma crodiagonal DD' is still a right angle ; as also the inclination of a to b, their oblique inclina tions may be given them by means of the same formulas employed in the diclinic system, ex cept that the axis D'D is to be substituted for C'C. The vertical axis AA' and the horizontal axes EE' (brachydiagonal) and FF' (macro diagoifal) thus obtained, are the axes in a tri- clinic form, in which a=6*=o=l. Different values may be given these axes, according to the method heretofore illustrated. Hexagonal System. \u2014 In this system there are three equal horizontal axes, at right angles with the vertical. The normal position 15g of the horizontal axes is represented inf. 158. The eye, placed in the line of the axis YY, ob serves two of the semiaxes, MZ and MU, pro jected in the same straight line, while the third, MY, appears a mere point. To give the axes a more eligible position for a representation of the various planes on atetraxonal solid, we re volve them from right to left through a certain number of degrees S, and elevate the eye at an angle c. The dotted lines in the figure repre sent the axes in their new situation, resulting from a revolution through a number of degrees equal to <5=YMY'. In this position the axis MY' is projected upon MP, MU' upon MN, and MZ' on MH. Designating the intermediate axis I, that to the right II, that to the left III, if the revolution is such as to give the pro- \u25a0 jections of I and II, the ratio of 1 : 2, the relations of the three projections will be \u2122Ut\u00b0Z taker (PM : HM) equal to 3, and \u2022 (b'P : PM) equal to 2, these being the most convenient ratios for representing the hexagonal crystalline forms. Ihe tal lowing will be the mode of construction : . , 1. Draw the lines AA.HII (f.159) at right angles with, and bisecting each other. Let HM=6 orHH=26 Divide HH into six parts by vertical lines. These lines, in cluding the left and' right hand verticals, may be numbered from one to six, as in"], [110, "102 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. the figure. In the first vertical, below H, lay off HS=^ 6, and from S draw a line through M to the fourth vertical. YY' is the projection of the axis I. aa T?..rt,.a A- rla'saar n hnp to the Sixth ver- 2. From x draw a line to iue -_-._-* ver- tical and parallel with HII. From T, the extremity of this line, draw a line to N in the second vertical. Then from the point U in which TN intersects the fifth vertical, draw a line through M to the second ver- tical ; UU' is the projection of the axis II. 3. From R, where TN intersects the third vertical, draw RZ to the first vertical parallel with HH. Then from Z draw a line through M to the sixth vertical : this line ZZ' is the projection of the axis III. 4. For the vertical axis, lay off from N on the second vertical (f. 159) a line of any length, and construct upon this line an equilateral triangle ; one side (NQ) of this triangle will intersect the first vertical at a distance, HV, from H, corresponding to Z'H in f.158 ; for in the triangle NHV, the angle HNV is an angle of 30\u00b0, and HN= JMH. MV is therefore the radius of the circle, (f. 158). Make therefore MA=MA' =MV ; AA' is the vertical axis, and YY', UU', ZZ' are the projected horizontal axes. The vertical axis has been constructed equal to the horizontal axes. Its actual length in different hexagonal or rhombohedral forms may be laid off according to the method sufficiently explained. If lines be drawn through the.extremities ofthe horizontal axes, parallel with the vertical axis, and the parts above and below be made equal to the vertical semiaxis, their extremities will be the vertices of the angles of a hexagonal prism, and by connecting them we obtain the projection of this solid. A double hexagonal pyramid, the isosceles dodecahedron, may be pro jected by connecting the extremities of the horizontal axes with each other, and also uniting them with the extremities of the vertical axis. By drawing lines through the extremities of each horizontal axis, parallel to a line connecting the extremities of the other two axes, a plane hex agonal figure will be obtained, which is the section of a hexagonal prism diagonal with the one above referred to ; and by connecting the angles of this hexagonal plane with extremities of the vertical axis, a second isosceles dodeca hedron is projected. To construct a rhombohedron, lay off verticals through the extremities of the horizontal axes, and make the parts both above and below these extremities, equal to the third of the vertical semiaxis, (f. 160). The points E, E, E', E', Ac, are thus determined ; and if the extremities of the vertical axis be connected with the points E or E', rhombohedrons in different positions, mR or \u2014 mR, will be constructed. Delineation of Secondary Planes on the Primary Forms. \u2014 Previous to drawing the secondary planes on a primary, it becomes necessary to determine the direction of the intersections of these planes with the primary faces, and also in most eases, with other secondary planes. The principles of analytical geometry have afforded Naumann formulas for these intersections; but it would be giving this article too great an extension to enter into a full discussion of this method of determining in tersections. It is in general sufficient to employ the method of construction. In the employment of the plan of construction, the projection of the prism 0, co - go, is the most convenient preliminary step ; that is, the cube in the monometric system, right square prism in the dimetric system, the rectangular prism in the trimetric, the right rhomboidal in the monoclinic, and the prism 0, oo-oo , oo-\u0153 ,"], [111, "Drawing of Figures of crystals. 103 in the diclinic and triclinic systems. This is advisable because in these forms the lateral edges are equal and parallel to the vertical axis, and the basal edges, to the horizontal axes ; and consequently in laying off the different planes, these edges may be substituted for the axes. Suppose, for example, the right rectangular prism has been projected, (f. 161), and it is required to place on its angles the plane 2, whose parametric ratio is 2 : 1 : 1. Since 2 refers to the vertical axis, we lay off on the lateral edge (e) twice as many parts of this edge as of each of the terminal edges, (e and e). Consequently, by taking a point in the edge e distant from a, \\ the length of e, and a point in each e and e, \\ their respective lengths, and then joining these points, the conditions will be complied with, and the plane 2P will be constructed. If the plane to be intro duced were 4-2, the parametric ratio of which is 4:2:1, (in which 4 refers to the vertical axis and 2 to the longer horizontal) we should in the same manner mark off 4 parts of e, 2 of e, and 1 of e ; if the plane were 4-~2 (in which 2 refers to the shorter horizontal axis), 2 parts of e should be laid off, and 1 of e. By connecting the points thus determined, the plane 4-2 or 4-2\" would be delineated. If the plane were 2-oo (2 : go : 1), which represents a plane on the longer terminal edge, 2 parts of e should be laid off, and 1 of e ; from the determined points in e and e, lines should be drawn to the opposite edges parallel with the edge e, and by connecting the extremities ofthe lines thus drawn, the desired representation of a plane 2-oo would be completed. The same should be repeated on all the similar edges. This will suffice to illustrate the manner of substituting the edges for the axes, and also the method of delineating single planes. The manner of determining the intersection of planes, we may illustrate by an example. Suppose it were required to place the planes 1, 2, 4-2', and 2-2 ,on a right rectangular prism. Two rectangular prisms should first be accurately projected by the method which has been explained. One, of a size which may be considered convenient for a representation of the crystal, drawn with light pencil marks ; the other of larger dimensions, for the purpose of determining the direction of the in tersections ; these intersections, when determined, are to be transferred to the smaller figure. On f. 161 we may first lay down the plane 1, by drawing lines con necting the centres of the three edges about the angle. These lines are necessarily parallel to the diagonals ofthe three faces; the triangle mno is therefore the plane 1. By connecting the points m, 6, n, the plane 2 is constructed ; for the plane m6re cuts off 2 parts of e to 1 of each e and e, as the expression 2 requires. To lay off 4-gJ (4:1: 2), let the whole edge ab represent 4 ; then an (-J- of e) will represent 2 parts on the edge e, and ap (J of e) will equal 1 part on e, agreeably to the ex pression 4-2\"; npb is therefore the plane i-i. The perimeters of the planes npb (4-5') and nmo (1) intersect one another in the points re and a; consequently the line of intersection between these two planes must be situated between these points, and therefore the direction of the intersection of 1 and 43 is n a. The planes nmb (2) and npb (4-if) intersect in the line \u00bb6, and therefore the inter section of 2 and 4-if is in the direction of n6."], [112, "104 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, Again, the intersection of 1 and 2 has the direction of mn. We may next lay off the plane 2-2,\" (2:2: 1), which may be constructed by marking off 2 parts on each e and e, and 1 part on e. Such a plane is mro, since ao=^e, am =|e, and ar=\u00b1e. Therefore the intersection of mro (2-2 ) with mno (1) has the di rection of the common line mo. The perimeters ofthe planes mro (2-2) and nj\u00bb6 (4-~2) intersect in the points a and 0. If therefore these planes formed an edge of intersection it would have the di rection of the line a0 or ro. The line ro ofthe plane mro (2-2 ) is parallel to re6 of the plane mre6 (2) ; the in tersections of 2-2\" and 2 would therefore be parallel with these lines. In this man ner all the mutual intersections of these and other planes may be obtained. Fig. 162 exhibits these planes in their respective positions, as1 above determined. The planes may be lettered as in the figure ; ?nreo=a, \u00bbre\u00ab6=a', mro=o, npb=b'. The edges a : P and a : a' were made parallel with mn, (f. 161). The intersection of P with 6 has the direction mr, that of P with 6', the direction of np. The intersections of a, o, iii, are parallel with mo ; those of a' 6, M, have the direction 6re, as deter mined above. The edge a : o' is drawn in the direction na, explained above as the intersection of npb and remo. Finally, the edge M : a' is drawn parallel with mb, and the edge m : 6 parallel with pb, which in f. 161 is obviously the intersection of pbn with m. The planes o and 6' do not meet; were the plane a' wanting, their intersection would have been drawn parallel with a0 or the edge a' : 6'. In this manner a sketch of a crystal may be made or rectified, or a figure may be drawn, whose prototype has not been observed. The crystallographie expressions, however, do not indicate the size of the planes. The edge M : 8' might have been so drawn as not to have formed an intersection with the plane P. Again, these secondary planes might have been so extended, that in connection with the corres ponding planes on the other angles, they should obliterate mostly or entirely the primary faces. The intersections of the planes would not however be changed in direction. There would be new intersections of planes on opposite parts of the same primary face, to be determined in the above manner. We may now add the planes J -do, 2-dd, l-oo , and oo : the two former are replace ments of the longer terminal edge e, the third is situated on the shorter edge e, and the last is a replacement of a lateral edge. We may also suppose that f-do meets the planes a and 6; 2-dd the plane 6; l-oo the planes a' and 6' ; and oo the planes a' and 6'. It is therefore necessary to deter mine the direction of these intersections. For this purpose f.161 is redrawn, (f.163), to avoid confusion irom the multiplicity of similar lines, (this would not be required in practice), and the lines in the preceding figure, not including the new planes, are here dotted. 163 The plane ntuv is so drawn that are equals le an at=% of Je, which fulfills the condi tions for the plane f-\u0153 (f : oo: 1). Again, srow is the plane 2-co (2 : oo: 1); for it cuts off 4 of c and 4 of e or 2 parts of e to 1 of e. P The perimeters ofthe planes vntu (f-5 ) and mno (1) intersect in the points re and a; the intersections of j-oo with 1 has therefore the direction are, and is parallel with the edge a : 6' in f. 162. The perimeters ofthe planes vntu (j-db) and mro, (2-2), intersect in the points a and y ; and a line from a to y marks the direction of the edge between the planes j-oo and 2-2. The perimeters of_the planes srow (2-\u0153) and mro (2-2 ) coincide in the line ro. The intersection of 2-co and 2-2 has therefore the direction ro, .and is parallel with the edge 6 : a' in f. 163. Again, the plane gmol represents l-oo (1 : l : oo), for it cuts off equal parts ofthe"], [113, "105 DRAWINGS OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. edges e and e. The perimeters of the planes gmol and nmo (1) coincide in the line mo ; their intersection is therefore parallel to this line, or to the edges a : 6 and o : M, I 162. The perimeters gmol and npb (4-2') intersect in the points a and f ; aline from a to { therefore marks the direction of the edge between l-a> and 4-2', (6'). Again, the plane prkh is the projection of go, ( oo : 1 : 1), for it cuts off equal por tions of e and e, and is parallel with the lateral edge. The perimeters prkh ( cd) and m6re (2) intersect in the points c and f ; a line between these points is parallel with mn. The intersection of these planes will therefore be parallel with mn, or the edge a : a', (f. 162). The perimeters prkh (oo) an&pnb (4-2') intersect in the points p and J. A line drawn from p to f determines therefore the intersection of oo and 4-lj (6'). 164 165 Figure 164 contains these additional planes laid down according to the above de ductions. The edge a : e' (\u00a3 -do ) is parallel with the edge a : 6' ; the edge e' : o has the direction ay; the edge e\" (2-oo\") : 6 is parallel with the edge o : a'; the edge a : e (l-oo ) is parallel with edge a : o or m : 6 ; the edge o' : e has the direction of a line from a to f ; the edge a' : e ( oo) is parallel with the edge P : a ; and finally the edge e: 6' has the direction of a line drawn from/i to f. In this manner the intersections of all possible planes may be determined and transferred. It should be observed that similar parts of a crystal are similarly modified. Fig. 146 is a completed representation of a crystal which presents the planes above designated, viz. : 0. co-co. oo-oo. 1. 2. 2-2- 4- ss. l-^>. |-oo. 2-oo . oo. P M M a a' o 6' e e' e\" e This same descriptive expression applies equally to f. 165, which contains the same planes as f. 164, but differently proportioned in size. The planes M have been diminished by the enlargement of e, thus producing a modified rhombic prism. The directions of the intersections are identical with those in f. 164. This figure illus trates a preceding remark, that the descriptive expression of planes indicate merely their situation, and not their size. According to the same method, crystals may be projected in each of the crystallo graphic systems, after their axes have been accurately laid down. It was remarked that the figure employed for determining the intersections should be large : in a large figure slight variations from the true direction or position of lines produce errors of less magnitude. Also the lines should be carefully and delicately drawn. With the point of a needle on glazed cards, a great degree of accuracy may be attained. Projection of Simple Secondary Forms in the Monometric System. \u2014 The projection of many of the simple secondary forms, \u2014 for example, the trisoctahedrons, the hex octahedrons, <fcc. \u2014 by the method of construction which has been explained, would be a long and tedious process ; at least when compared with the more simple method, depending on the relative lengths ofthe axes and the rhombic and trigonal interaxes in these forms. The right lines passing through the centre of the octa hedron to the centres of its edges, are called rhombic interaxes ; and those which pass to the centres of the faces, are the trigonal interaxes. In the several mono metric forms, the extremities of one or more of these interaxes extended or dimin- 14"], [114, "106 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. ished in their lengths, occupy the vertices of the solid angles. If therefore these points (the extremities ofthe interaxes) can be determined in the several crystalline forms, it will only remain to connect them, in order to form a projection of these solids. The principles of analytical geometry afford the means of determining how much the interaxes of the regular octahedron must be increased or diminished to equal the interaxes in these different forms. It is thus found that each half of a trigonal m teraxis for any form mPn must be increased by that portion expressed in the fraction 2 mn \u2014 (m+n) _ mn+(m+n) ' and for each half of a rhombic interaxis, we have the corresponding fraction \u2014 \u2014 . By giving m and n different values from 0 to go, the value of these interaxes for any monometric form may be obtained. The following values are thus deduced for several occurring forms: Trig, interax. Rhombic interax. Trig, interax. Rhombic interax. 2 (f. 49) I 0 og-2 (f. 33) 1 i oo (f. 14) i 0 oo-3 (f. 34) \u00a3 i 3-f (f. 51) 4 | 2-2 (f. 39) * I 4-2 $ ;L 3-3 (f. 40) | i 7 To construct the form 4-2, the octahedron is first to be projected, and its axes and interaxes drawn. Then add to each half of each trigonal interaxis, five-seventli9 of its length ; and to each half of each rhombic interaxis, one-third of its length. The extremities of the lines thus extended, are situated in the vertices of the solid angles of the hexoetahedron 4-2, and by connecting them, the projection oi this form is completed. In the inclined hemihedral monometric forms \u2014 that is, those hemihedral forms whose opposite faces are inclined to one another and not parallel, as the tetra hedron, &q. \u2014 the rhombic interaxes do not terminate in the vertices of the solid angles, and may therefore be thrown out of view in the projection of these solids. The two halves of each trigonal interaxis, terminate in the vertices of dissimilar angles and are of unequal lengths. One is identical with the corresponding in the holohedral forms, and is called the holohedral portion of the interaxis ; the other is the hemihedral portion. The length ofthe latter maybe determined by adding to the half of the octahedral interaxis that portion of the same indicated in the formula 2 mre \u2014 (rei \u2014 re) mn+(m \u2014 re)' If the different halves of the trigonal interaxes be assumed at one time, as the holohedral, and again as the hemihedral portion, the reverse forms- -and \u2014 may be projected. The following table contains the values of the above fraction for several of the inclined hemihedral forms, and also the corresponding values for the holohedral portion of the interaxis.

The parallel hemihedrons (for example, the pentagonal dodecahedron, or hemitetra hexahedron) contain a solid angle, situated in a line between the extremities of each pair of semiaxes, which is called an unsymmetrical solid angle. The vertices of these angles are at unequal distances from the two adjacent axes, and therefore are not in the line of the rhombic interaxes. The co ordinates of this solid angle for any form, as srei-re] \u25a0 , may be found by the formulas m(n \u2014 1) n(m \u2014 1) \u25a0\u2014 and ;-. By means of these mn\u2014 1 mn \u2014 1 J formulas, the situation of two points, a and 6, (f. 166) in each of the axes may be deter mined : and if lines are drawn through a and 6 in each semiaxis parallel to the other axes, the intersections c c' , of these lines will be the vertices of the unsymmetrical solid an- [m-re] gles, those marked c of the form \u2014 r \u2014 and and those marked c' of the form \u2014 . The trigonal interaxes are of the same length as in the holohedral forms. The values of these interaxes, and of the coordinates of the unsymmetrical solid angle for different parallel hemihedrons, are contained in the following table : Trigonal Coord, of the Trigonal Coord, of the interaxis. unsym. sol.

The scalenohedron (f. 127 dotted lines) mR\" admits of a similar construction with the rhombohedron mR.

IH. CLEAVAGE. The mineral mica, as is well known, easily splits into thin transparent plates or lamin\u00e6. This is often effected with little more difficulty than separating the leaves of a book, and at once sug gests the idea, that like a book, this mineral may be composed of a great number of closely applied leaves. This property of mica depends on its crystallization, and the process of separation is termed cleavage, Galena is another instance of a mineral capable of easy cleavage. It differs from mica, however, in having three cleavage directipns at right angles with one another. This min eral, therefore, instead of splitting into thin plates, breaks into small cubes, Calcereous spar also admits of easy cleavage, but yields rhombohedrons. The directions in which a crystal may be cleaved, are termed natural joints, and the slices obtained, are called lamin\u00e6. The facility with which cleavage may be obtained, is very une qual in different minerals. In some instances, as in the first above cited, the lamin\u00e6 are separable by the fingers. In others, a slight blow of the hammer is sufficient ; others require the application of a sharp-cutting instrument, and often some considerable skill in its use. When other means fail, it may sometimes be effected by heating the mineral and plunging it, when hot, into cold water. Attempts of this kind are occasionally effectual with quartz. In many instances, cleavage cannot be obtained by any means, owing to the strong cohesion of the lamin\u00e6. In these cases, however, the direction of cleavage is sometimes indicated by lines on the surface. It is often important to observe these lines when cleavage is possible, in order to determine its direction before applying the knife. When cleavage is easily obtained, it is said to be eminent. The general laws, with respect to cleavage, are as follows : 1. Cleavage in crystals of the same species yields the same form and angles. 2. Cleavage takes place parallel either to one or more of the faces of a fundamental form, or to its diagonals, or to some second ary planes. 3. Cleavage is obtained with equal ease or difficulty parallel to similar faces, and with unequal ease or difficulty parallel to dis similar faces. 4. Cleavage parallel to similar planes, affords planes of similar lustre and appearance, and the converse. According to the laws above stated, cleavage is obtained with equal ease or difficulty parallel to all the faces of a cube, octahe dron, dodecahedron, or rhombohedron, which solids are contained under equal planes._ The right square prism, right rhombic prism, and oblique rhombic prism, may be cleaved with equal ease or dif ficulty, parallel to their lateral planes, since these are similar. Of-"], [117, "109 CLEAVAGE. ten, however, no cleavage can be effected in these prisms, except parallel to the bases, and, in many instances, not even in this di rection. Frequently the cleavage is diagonal ; in the square prism it will be alike in both vertical axial planes, but in the rhombic prisms it will be unlike, since these planes are not equal. The right rectangular, right rhomboidal, and oblique rhomboidal prisms, have the cleavage unequal parallel to their faces, if attain able at all in these directions ; and according to the third law, the cleavage in the three directions will produce faces of unlike lustre and general appearance. This is exemplified in gypsum : in one direction, it is cleavable with great facility into thin lamin\u00e6 of perfect transparency, and highly polished surfaces ; in a second direction the crystalline lamin\u00e6 first bend and then break, exhibit ing a surface which is not smooth, nor possessed of much lustre ; in a third direction, it is brittle, and breaks immediately on at tempting to bend it, affording a surface smoother than the second, but not polished. In thick masses the second and third cleavages are scarcely attainable. Two of these cleavages incline at an oblique angle, but one is at right angles with the third. Cleavage is said to be basal when in a form it is parallel to the base, (0) ; and lateral, when parallel to the lateral planes. Pris matic, when parallel to the lateral planes oo. Diagonal, in a rhombic prism, when vertical and parallel to the planes go-go. In the trimetric system, maerodiagonal, if parallel to the longer diagonal ; brachydiagonal, if parallel to the shorter diagonal. In the monoclinic system, clinodiagonal, if parallel to the inclined lateral axis ; orthodiagonal, if parallel to the other lateral axis. When rhombohedrons have a cleavage parallel to a plane trun cating the vertical angle, it is described as basal, it being parallel to the base of the related hexagonal prism. When the cleavage is parallel to the faces of a rhombohedron, it is styled rhombohedral. Other cleavages are described by mentioning the particular plane with which they correspond in direction. M. A. Baudrimont has recently observed that the three primary rhombohedral cleavages of calc spar are not always absolutely equal, and, moreover, that there are other cleavages not before re cognized. His observations seem to show, that while the fact that the vertical axis is normally an axis of symmetry, as demonstrated by the crystallization, and by optical, thermotic, and acoustic inves tigations, still extrinsic circumstances cause some variations from perfect symmetry in the cleavage, and also correspondingly in the lustre and transparency. The cleavages observed by him are as follows : \u2014 1. Parallel to the faces ofthe primary rhombohedron. 2. Parallel to the longer diagonal of the primary faces. 3. Parallel to the shorter diagonal of the primary faces. i. Parallel to different secondary planes."], [118, "110 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. I. Of the first kind the cleavage may be, a.

The laws of crystallization, when unmodified by extrinsic causes, should produce forms of exact symmetry ; the angles being not only equal, but also the homologous faces of crystals and the several dimensions. This symmetric harmony is, however, so uncommon, that it can hardly be considered other than an ideal perfection. Crystals are very generally distorted, and often the fundamental forms are so completely disguised, that an intimate familiarity with the possible irregularities is required, in order to unravel their complexities. Even the angles may vary rather widely in crystals that are seemingly pure. The irregularities of crystals may be treated of under four heads:* 1. Imperfections of surface; 2. Variations of form and dimensions ; 3. Internal imperfections and impurities ; 4. Vari ations of angles. I. IMPERFECTIONS IN THE SURFACES OF CRYSTALS, 1. Striated Surfaces. The parallel furrows on the surfaces of crystals are called stri\u00e6, and such surfaces are said to be seated. Each little ridge on a striated surface is enclosed by two narrow planes more or less regular. These planes often correspond in po sition to the secondary or primary planes of the crystal, and we may suppose these ridges to have been formed by a continued oscil lation in the operation of the causes that give rise, when acting un interruptedly, to enlarged planes. By this means, the surfaces of a crystal are marked in parallel lines, with a succession of narrow planes meeting at an angle and constituting the ridges referred to. * Many of the following facts, with the general arrangement of them are ex tracted from JNaumann's work on Crystallography."], [119, "IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. 111 This combination of different planes in the formation of a surface has been termed the oscillatory combination . The horizontal stri\u00e6 on prismatic crystals of quartz, (f. 189 and 193), are examples of this combination, in which the oscillation has taken place between the prismatic and pyramidal planes. As the crystals lengthened, there was apparently a continual effort to assume the terminal pyramidal planes, which effort was interruptedly overcome by a strong tendency to an increase in the length of the prism. In this manner, crystals of quartz are often tapered to a point, without the usual pyramidal terminations. Cubes of pyrites are generally striated in 167 such a way that the stri\u00e6 on adjacent faces are at right angles with one another, as in the accompanying figure. These lines are par allel to the intersections of the primary sur faces with the planes of a pentagonal dode cahedron, (f. 67, 68, and 69), the most common secondary of pyrites ; and they have evidently resulted from an oscillation be tween the primary and this secondary. Diagonal stri\u00e6 sometimes occur. on the iron pyrites. faces of a cube, showing an oscillatory combination between the cube and octahedron. The rhombic dodecahedron is often striated parallel either with the longer or the shorter diagonal of its faces ; the former resulting from an oscillatory combination of the dode cahedron with the regular octahedron, and the latter with the cube or planes bevelling the edges of the cube, as in 169 Aplome. The accompanying figure represents a distorted crystal of magnetic iron from ITad dam, Ct, illustrating the oscillation between the octahedron and dodecahedron. Tlie faces of trapezohedral garnets are often striated parallel with the symmetrical diagonal, show ing an oscillation with the dodecahedron. Khombohedrons of chabazite and red silver ore are often striated parallel to the terminal _3] \u2022 31- .. ... *n_i. *i_ \u2022 j.\" -__ edges, indicating an oscillatory combination Magnetic iron. between the primary faces and a secondary plane replacing these edges. Prisms of tourmaline are very commonly bounded by three con- vex surfaces, owing to an oscillatory combination of the planes I and i2. (See under Tourmaline). It is obvious that the irregularities described must at times affect the angle of inclination between planes. The interfacial angles of a rhombic prism are thus made more obtuse, being sometimes increased 15 or 20 degrees, and occasionally, as just stated, the angles are lost in a curved surface. This seldom leads to"], [120, "112 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. important error, since the striations generally show that the faces are not simple planes. Tremolite, Tourmaline, &c, are examples. The striations on the lateral surfaces of foliated minerals like mica and gypsum, are merely the edges of lamin\u00e6. The interposition of foreign substances in parallel lines also pro duce striations. Brewster attributes to this source the parallel di agonal hues in some rhombohedral crystals of cale spar. Besides striations, the surfaces of crystals are sometimes formed of minute crystals ; such are the faces of octahedral crystals of fluor, consisting of minute cubes. Cubes of galena occur at Rossie having truncated angles and edges, in which the surfaces are covered with cubic prominences, the sides of which are parallel to the planes on the angles. These surfaces were probably eroded by some solvent or chemical agent.* Angular markings are also often observed, as on quartz crystals, beryls, &c, indicating the internal structure of the crystal. 2. Camemous Crystals. Crystals not unfrequently occur with a deep pyramidal de- 169 pression occupying the place of each plane, as is often observed in common salt, alum' and sul phur. The annexed figure represents a cavern ous cube of salt. In the solution of crystals, the same form is sometimes obtained, owing to the fact that the centres ofthe faces yield sooner than the edges and angles. A remarkable cav ernous crystal of pyrites, from Aim erode, is de scribed by Hausmann. It is an elongated cube common salt. with its upper edges replaced by faces of the dodecahedron ; but instead of a corresponding replacement of the lateral edges, a deep rectangular channel occupies the place of each. It resembles a cruciform crystal of Harmotome ; but the striations show that is not compound. Crystals of gold are often thus cavernous. Sometimes the octa hedrons occur with a triangular cavity, in place of each face. The same is met with in other species. They may often be imitated in metallic species by pouring off the fused metal just after crys tallization begins ; the diagonal planes of the crystal joining oppo site edges are entire, while the faces are wanting, snowing that the cohesion in the latter is weaker. Other crystals with cavernous faces are produced by an increase of a crystal on certain sides or planes, and not on others, as in f. 170, of calcite, in which, after the crystal had reached considerable size,_ it was enlarged on the planes R and not on a. In f. 171, also calcite, a six-sided prism tapering above nearly with a curve, was * For a paper of great interest by Brewster on the optical figures produced by the action of solvents on the surfaces of crystals, see Phil. Mag. (4), v. 16, Jan. 1851."], [121, "113 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. afterwards, by a subsequent process, capped with a flat rhombo hedral crystal of the same species. It is from Bristol, Ct. 3. Cwrved Surfaces. Curved surfaces resulting from what is termed oscillatory com bination, have already been noticed. Other curvatures proceed from a curvature in the lamin\u00e6 constituting the crystal. Crystals of diamond have convex faces, and they are sometimes almost spheres, (f.185, and f. 266 under Diamond). This mode of curvature, in which all the faces are equally convex, is less common than that in which a convex surface is opposite and parallel to a corres ponding concave surface. Rhombohedrons of spathic iron and pearl spar are usually thus curved, as is shown under spathic iron, The saddle-shaped crystals of the same mineral, are re markable instances of several curvatures in the same face. A singular curvature is shown in the accompa- 172 nying figure of white iron pyrites. The conical crystals of brown zinc blende and the lenticular and conical crystals of gypsum, are other examples. Crystals of quartz are^sometimes curved and twisted. When this takes place in the left-handed and right handed crystals, the twist is to the right or left, according as the crystal is right or left-handed.* The surfaces of crystals are sometimes rounded, in consequence of having been partially fused, or dissolved. The globular quartz of St. Lawrence Co., 1ST. Y., is supposed by Prof. Emmons to have been thus rounded. Prismatic crystals of quartz are sometimes aggregated by then sides, and thus form plates, with the terminations of the crystals on the opposite surfaces. As the crystals continue enlarging at the extremities, these expand, while the confined sides can receive no additions ; and the consequence sometimes is that crystals are formed with the prismatic sides concave, the prism being smallest * Fig. 151 of quartz, is a left-handed crystal, as is apparent from the relative situations ofthe planes. 15"], [122, "114 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. at middle and largest at the base of the pyramid. It is not usual that such crystals are easily separated from one another, but this sometimes happens. n. VARIATIONS TN THE FORMS AND DIMENSIONS OF CRYSTALS. The simplest modification of \\form in crystals, consists in a sim ple variation in length or breadth, without a disparity in similar secondary planes. The distortion, however, extends very generally to the secondary planes, especially when the elongation of a crystal takes place in the direction of a diagonal, instead of the crystal lographic axes. In many instances, one or more secondary planes are obliterated by the enlargement of others, proving^ a source of much perplexity to the young student. The interfacial angles re main constant, unaffected by these variations in form. As most of the difficulties in the study of crystals arises from these distortions, this subject is one of great importance to the student. Monometric System. \u2014 A - cube, (f. 1), lengthened or shortened along one axis, becomes a right square prism, (f. 2), and if varied in the direction of two axes is changed to a rectangular prism, (f. 3). Cubes of pyrites, galena, fluor spar, &c, are generally thus distorted. It is very unusual to find a cubic crystal that is a true symmetrical cube. In some species the cube or octahedron, (or other monometric firm), is lengthened into a capillary crystal or needle, as happens in Red Copper and Pyrites. Crystals of acic ular pyrites occur at the Middletown (Ct.) lead mine. An octahedron flattened parallel to a face is reduced to a tabular crystal, (f. 173). If lengthened in the same direction, it takes the form in f. 174 ; or if still farther lengthened to the obliteration of A', it becomes an acute rhombohedron, (same figure). When an octahedron is extended in the direction of a line be tween two opposite edges, it has the general form of a rectangular octahedron ; and still farther extended, as in f. 175, it is changed to a rhombic prism with dihedral summits. The figure represents this prism lying on its acute edge, (spinel, fluor, magnetite)."], [123, "115 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. The dodecahedron lengthened along a diagonal between the ob tuse solid angles, becomes a six-sided prism with three-sided summits, as in f. 176 ; and shortened in the 179 same direction, is a short prism of the same kind, (f. 178). Both resemble secondaries to a rhombohedron, and are common in garnet and zinc blende. When lengthened in the direction of one of the crystallographic axes, it becomes a square prism with pyramidal summits, (f. 177), and shortened along the same axis it is reduced to a square octahedron, with truncated basal angles, (f. 179). The trapezohedron is still more disguised by its distortions. When elongated in the line of an octahedral axis, it assumes the form in f. 180 ; and still farther lengthened, to the obliteration of some of the planes, becomes a scalene dodecahedron, (f. 181). This has been observed in fluor spar. If the elongation takes place along a crystallographic axis, it changes to a double eight-sided 180 181 182 183 pyramid with four-sided summits, (f. 182); or if these summit planes are obliterated by a farther extension, it becomes a com plete eight-sided double pyramid, (f. 183). Still more complex forms are of occasional occurrence among monometric crystals, especially when modified by secondary planes. Fig. 184 represents a garnet from Monzoniberg ; it is a combination of the dodecahedron and trapezohedron ; but the crystal is so al tered by distortion, that only four dodecahedral faces (e) remain, and sixteen of the trapezohedral, (a') ; and the latter are of very"], [124, "116 ( K VSTALLOGRAPHY. unequal size. Fig. 185 is a distorted twin of diamond. It is short ened in the direction of a diagonal, so that only two octahedral planes (a) remain, and 12 out of 48 planes o'\u2014 the six around each 184 185 186 Diamond. Galena. a, (f. 51). Fig. 186 represents a crystal of Galena from Rossie. It is a shortened cube ; the lateral faces are very irregularly curved, and consist of the primary faces of the cube and the planes trun cating the lateral edges. Some of the terminal edges are also truncated. Tlie crystal is surmounted by a low pyramid, consist ing of four planes on each of the angles and edges, which, owing to the distortion, do not occur elsewhere on the crystal. The cleav ages of the crystal easily explain the relations of the several planes to the primary. The scalene dodecahedron of calcite is shown distorted in f. 187, 187 which appears, however, to be an eight-sided prism, bounded laterally by the planes R, e', <?', and R, and their opposites, and terminated by the re maining planes. The following figures of quartz, (f. 188, 189), represent distorted forms of this mineral, in wliich some ofthe pyramidal faces by en largement displace the prismatic faces, and nearly obliterate some of the other pyramidal faces. Figures 339, 340, under Quartz, are other crystals less distorted. The in- Calcite* clination of E on a or a\" is the same in all the various distorted forms ; and by measuring the angles, and also by observing the similar surfaces of like planes, the ho mologous parts may be distinguished, however much disguised. The angle a on a around the prism is 120\u00b0; and consequently by a"], [125, "IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS, 117 measurement these planes may be detected. It is also a help to note that like planes are alike in surface. Quartz. Quartz. The prismatic planes of quartz may be usually distinguished from the other faces, by their horizontal stri\u00e6. Fig. 190 of apatite is the same form that is represented in f. 191\u00ab but greatly distorted. The planes e', e, e\", between P and the right M, are enlarged, while the corresponding planes below are in part obliterated. By observing that similar planes are lettered alike, the two figures maybe compared throughout. Fig. 192 represents a hexagonal prism of beryl distorted so as to resemble a rhombic prism with the acute lateral edges truncated, two opposite planes M being nearly obliterated by the extension of the other four. Curved Crystals. \u2014 Curves in imbedded crystals are of frequent occurrence ; and in implanted crystals they are not very uncom- mon. The annexed figure of quartz (f. 193) illustrates this kind of distortion ; the same is described by Beck as occurring in the apatite of St. Lawrence Co., N\". Y. Six-sided prisms of calcite are occasionally curved in the same manner. In many species, the crystals appear as if they had been broken transversely into many pieces, a slight displacement of which has given a curved form to the prism. This is common in tourmaline"], [126, "118 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, and beryl. The beryls of Monroe, Conn., often present these in terrupted curvatures, as represented in f. 194. Quartz. Beryl, Monroe, Ct.

The plates of ice were attached to the edges ofthe stones and curv ed away from the mortar.* Similar crystallizations of gypsum from the mam moth cave of Kentucky, have been described by Dr. Locke of Cincinnati.

Le Conte, on this subject, Proc. Amer. Assoc. iii, 1850, p. 20."], [127, "IRREGULARITIES Otf CRYSTALS. 119 m. INTERNAL IMPERFECTIONS AND IMPURITIES. The transparency of crystals is often destroyed by disturbed crystallization, or by impurities taken up from the solution during the process of crystallization. Oxyd of iron, chlorite, pyrites, silica, and alumina, are among the most common of these impurities. Any mineral, indeed, that may be dissolved or mechanically sus pended in the menstruum with the crystallizing mineral, may be thus entangled and forced into the constitution of crystals. The impurities often take a symmetrical arrangement. In gene ral, foreign matters collect most abundantly about the centre and along the diagonals, and also in planes between the centre and edges of the crystal. The latter taking place in the cube, produces an arrangement similar in form to the cavernous cubes above de scribed. In chiastolite, the foreign matter is arranged about the central axis, and in planes running from this axis to the edges, and also about the lateral edges and exterior surface ofthe crystal, (see fig ures under Andalusite). Dr. Jackson has observed the same in staurotide. Tremolite has also been observed, according to Nau mann, with an interior tesselated structure, like chiastolite. It had crystallized in contact with pulverulent carbonate of lime and mag nesia. Fluor spar, common salt, and numerous other species, some times present similar appearances. The zircons of St. Lawrence County, .New York, often have a tesselated structure. Some crys tals are grayish-white with the exception of the angles, which are bright chestnut-brown, either of a uniform color, or in parallel stripes about the plane 33. In one crystal from this region, Pro fessor Beck found a nucleus of carbonate of lime, and it is proba ble, as he suggests, that the white coloring matter thus symmetri cally arranged, is carbonate of lime. Crystals of quartz from Southington, Ct., have an asteriated structure within, arising from the meeting at centre of six whitish planes, corresponding to the six lateral edges of the crystals; the exterior of the prism is also whitish. In many instances, the foreign matter lies in layers parallel with some of the exterior planes. This is often noticed in crystals of quartz, in which there are layers of different colors parallel with the faces of the terminal pyramids, owing usually to intermissions in the process of their formation. In this way transparent crystals sometimes have an exterior coating of an opaque white color, or contain a crystal within of different color, &c. Tabular crystals of heavy spar are often banded parallel with the lateral faces. The mica from Jones's creek near Baltimore, contains opaque lines or bands in concentric hexagonal figures, which arise from the same cause. In one specimen the meeting of two hexagonal"], [128, "120 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY . figures indicated a compound structure, or twin crystallization, a fact not apparent from any peculiarity on the surface of the mica. A mica trom New Hampshire has similar markings, and in one transparent specimen in the cabinet of Dr. Jackson of Boston, there are broad bands of a deep black color meeting at angles of 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, the angles of the crystal. Among the most remarkable impurities are the drops of liquids that occur in many crystals. In some cases they appear to be simply water or a solution of the mineral itself, and when exposed by tracture, crystallization takes place on evaporation. In other instances, they are resinous fluids of different kinds, as first de tected by Sir David Brewster in topaz, quartz, and other minerals. The same author has discovered in topaz innumerable micro scopic crystals arranged more or less in extensive layers, though sometimes in concentric arches or radiations, among which were many different forms, as the tetrahedron, the cube and its seconda ries, rhombohedron, hexagonal plates, prisms with plane and pyra midal summits, flat octahedron more or less modified, rectangular plates. Some of the tesseral crystals melt easily and others not at all ; and others are infusible : so that at least five different substan ces were indicated.* Two different fluids have been recognized by Brewster in some topazes. In one crystal a cavity 0\"18 in. long was partly filled with a fluid of still different character, besides different crystals. Fluor spar, Calcite, and Heavy spar are other species that have been found to contain fluids. A microscopic examination of iridescent feldspar has brought to light that in some cases it contains minute crystals of specular iron disseminated through it, to which the peculiar iridescence is owing. The same is true of some red Cancrinite. TV. VARIATIONS IN THE ANGLES OF CRYSTALS. The greater part of the distortions described occasion no change in the interfacial angles of crystals. But those imperfections that produce convex, curved, or striated faces, necessarily cause vari ations, as explained on pp. Ill, 113. The surfaces of larger crystals often have a composite character, as a magnifying glass will show, if not visible to the naked eye ; they appear as if there had been a tendency to the formation of smaller crystals, while the crystal was enlarging. The polygonal markings on quartz crystals are of this character. Octahedrons of fluor sometimes have the faces made up of little cubes. Such a cause produces more or less irreg ularity in the planes and their inclinations. Sometimes while * See further on this subject, Trans. Roy. Soc. of Edinburg, for 1823 and 1826 ; and Trans. Royal. Soc. London, 1847, xvi, 11 ; Phil. Mag. [41 v. 235, 1853 ; also Amer. Jour. Science, xii, 214, 1827, and [2] v, 420, 1848."], [129, "121 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. enlargement is in progress and far advanced, portions of a crystal become more or less independent in their crystallization, and thus quite large variations from symmetry result, exhibited either in the unnatural protuberance or breadth of certain parts, or a subdi vision into distinct crystals. Besides imperfections from these sources, there are others de rived from the presence of impurities, entangled in the crystal lizing mineral. Such impurities, although in many instances sym metrically arranged, still influence unfavorably the form of the crystal; the foreign particles are guided in an imperfect degree by the forces of the crystallizing molecules, and have not the powers of arrangement in themselves which can carry each to its place ; and hence impure crystals, as macles, commonly differ much in their angles. When these foreign ingredients are not thus sym metrically arranged, their injurious effect on the form is even more striking ; and there are few cases of crystals of large size, in which such impurities do not exist. Even the presence of foreign ingredients in solution, when the crystallization is going on, seems often to affect the angles ; and such ingredients may be included in the species without its being at all apparent except by analysis. According to the measurements of calc spar by A. Baudrimont, the rhombs of this mineral seldom have the three angles at sum mit perfectly identical. The variations of angles just alluded to, are of no constant cha racter, and are therefore imperfections. They often amount to 30' even in crystals that appear regular, and sometimes to two or three degrees. A cube under some circumstances may have the angles of a rhombic prism ; but the identity of the similar faces, and the tesseral character in the modifications of the crystal, will still be apparent ; the six bounding planes will be alike in lustre, cleavage, hardness, and stri\u00e6, however much the angles may vary, and this is never the case with any but equilateral solids. The distribution of modifying planes will prove in like manner the perfect simi larity of the edges and angles. So in a form resembling a rhom bohedron, if the angles at the lateral edges differed fundamentally from one another, the edges would be unlike, and the modifications would be monoclinic, (or those of an oblique rhombic prism), in stead of rhombohedral. Thus by means of the modifications and physical characters, as already illustrated, we may distinguish without difficulty between accidental variations and those of a fundamental character. Without such modifications some cubical crystals, as of salt, might be taken for rhombohedrons of 92\u00b0 or 93\u00b0. The angles of crystals are varied also by temperature. But this kind of variation depends on the nature of matter or its relation to heat, and is not properly noticed in this place. 16"], [130, "122 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. V. DETERMINATION AND MEASUREMENT OF CRYSTALS. Owing to the irregular variations of form in crystals, it is evident that the shape alone is seldom sufficient to determine the system of crystallization. The indications giving important aid, may be briefly reviewed. a. Cleavage,- \u2014 Cleavage being alike parallel to like faces, and unlike parallel to unlike faces, if a cube affords three equal rec- tangular cleavages, (equal in ease and alike in lustre), the form must be monometric ; if two equal rectangular cleavages, it is dimetric ; if three unequal, it is trimetric. Again, if the angle between the cleavage planes is oblique, this gives further evidence as to the system, as the principles already explained sufficiently elucidate. b. Lustre, Hardness, Color, Character of Suifaces. \u2014 Like planes are alike in lustre, hardness, stri\u00e6, whatever may be the variations in size. Hence, if a cube has like stri\u00e6 on all its six sides, the form is plainly monometric ; but if the surface of one of its oppo- site sides differs from that of the others, the form belongs to some other system. So hardness and color often differ, and lustre almost uniformly, for unlike planes. (See beyond, under Color). c. Refraction, Polarization. \u2014 As explained on a following page, the system of crystallization has generally a direct relation to the polarizing properties of the crystal. When we have but fragments of a mineral, this mode is highly important. d. Heat, Elasticity. \u2014 The properties of crystals as regards the conduction of heat, and their elasticity, have a direct dependence on their crystalline form ; but the means of making observations on these points are not yet easily obtained, and require much skill in their application. e. Character of the modifications of crystals. \u2014 The position of planes upon crystals is an unerring guide to the system of crystal- lization, when the crystal is much modified, (except in some ofthe grosser distortions), and may serve to correct deductions from meas urements. If a cube is' found to have slightly oblique angles on measurement, and still the edges are all modified alike, and the angles also alike, there is good evidence that the crystal is mono metric, for only like parts of a crystal are alike in their modifica tions. If the crystal were rhombohedral, as the apparently oblique angle might be thought to imply, there would be two kinds of edges to the rhombohedron, and two kinds of solid angles, to be modified differently. If a cubical crystal has different planes in number or inclination on a set of lateral edges from what it has on the basal, the form must be dimetric. The same principle is easily applied, to other cases. In such examinations, the characters men tioned in the following table should be noted : \u2014"], [131, "123 DETERMINATION OF CRYSTALS. 1.

Measurement of Angles. \u2014 The importance of this means of as certaining the system of crystallization is obvious. As has been im plied, it may lead to erroneous deductions ; but in most cases it enables us to correct conclusions drawn from other sources. It generally gives essential aid in carrying out the mode of discrim ination last laid down. The occurrence of the angle 120\u00b0 should always suggest the pos sibility (not the certainty) that the form may be hexagonal or mo nometric ; or of 109\u00b0 28', or 70\u00b0 32', that the form may be the regular octahedron ; or of 135\u00b0, that one of the planes giving the angle truncates a rectangular edge. * The rhombohedron is the only solid included in this division, any of whos\u00ab angles admit of a truncation or replacement by three or six planes. f The terminal edges of the octahedrons are here termed lateral, in order that these statements may be generally applicable both to prisms and octahedrons."], [132, "124 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. USE OF GONIOMETERS. The angles of crystals are measured by means of instruments called Goniometers. a. Common Goniometer, called also, Haufs Goniometer.\u2014 The simplest of these instruments, called the Common Goniometer, is here represented. It consists, 1, of a semicircular arc graduated to half degrees, and, consequently, measuring 180\u00b0 ; 2, two arms, one of which, ab,is stationary, or admits only of a sliding i notion back- ward and forward, by means of slits, gh, ik. The other arm turns on o, the centre of the arc, as an axis ; there is also a slit, np, in this arm. By means of these slits, the parts of the arms below o, that is, ao, co, may be shortened, which is found necessary for the measurement of small crystals. The faces, whose inclination is to be measured, are applied between the arms ao, co, which are open ed till they just admit the crystal, and are seen to be closely ap plied to the surface of the same. This should be determined by close examination, holding it at the same time up to the light and observing that no light passes between the arm and the plane of the crystal. The number of degrees on the arc, between k and the left edge of d, (this edge being in the line of the centre o of the arc), is the required angle. For measuring crystals partially imbedded, the arc is usually jointed at fi so that the part, as may be folded back on the other quadrant. When the angle has been measured, the arms are se cured in their place by the screw at o, and the arc restored to its former position, and there fastened by the bar, mo. The angle may now be read off. The arms sometimes admit of being separated from the arc, in order to obtain more conveniently the required angle. They may then be adjusted to the arc* in a very simple manner, which will be understood by the observer without expla nation, and the angle read off as above."], [133, "125 MEASUREMENT OF CRYSTALS. When a goniometer is not at hand, approximate results may be obtained by means of an extemporaneous pair of arms, made care fully of mica, or even of Bristol board. After taking the angles with them in the manner explained, place them on a sheet of paper, and with a pencil and ruler lay off the angle by drawing lines parallel with, or in the direction of, each arm of the forceps. This angle may then be measured by means of a graduated arc, or a scale of cords or tangents. The results obtained with a common goniometer are seldom within a quarter of a degree of the truth. For polished crystals, we have a much superior instrument in the Reflective Goniometer of Wollaston. b. The Reflective Goniometer of Wollaston. \u2014 The reflective goni ometer is represented in the annexed figure. The principle on which this instrument is constructed may be understood by refer ence to the following figure, which represents a crystal, whose an- gle, abc, is required. The eye at P, looking at the face ofthe crystal, be, observes a reflected image of m, in the direc tion of Pn, The crystal may now be so changed in its position, that the same image is seen reflect ed by the next face, and in the same direction, Pn. To effect, this, the crystal must be turned 197 around, until abd has the present direction of be. The angle dbc, measures, therefore, the number of degrees through which the crystal must be turned. But dbc, subtracted from 180\u00b0, equals the required angle of the crystal, abc. The crystal is, therefore, passed in its revolution through a number of degrees, which subtracted from 180\u00b0 give the required angle. This angle evidently might be measured by attaching the crystal to a graduated circle, which should turn with the crystal This object is convenient ly accomplished by the in genious and simple contri vance of Wollaston. AB is the circle, gradua ted to half degrees. By means of the vernier, v, minutes are measured. The wheel m is attached to the main axis, and moves the graduated circle, together with the adjusted crystal. The wheel n is connected with an axis that passes through the main axis, (which is hollow for the purpose), and moves merely"], [134, "126 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. the parts to which the crystal is attached, in order to aid in its adjustment. The contrivances for the adjustment of the crystal are at p, q, r. To use the instrument, it must be placed on a small stand or table, and so elevated as to allow the observer to rest his elbows on the table. The whole, thus firmly arranged, is to be placed in front of a window, distant from the same from six to twelve feet, with the axis of the instrument parallel to it. Before operation, a dark line should be drawn below the window near the floor, paral lel to the bars of the window ; or, what is still better, on a slate or board, placed before the observer on the table. The crystal is attached to the movable plate q, by a piece of wax, and so arranged, that the edge of intersection of the two planes, including the required angle, shall be in a line with the axis of the instrument. This is done by varying its situation on the plate q, or the situation of the plate itself, or by means of the adjacent joints and wheel, r, s,p. When apparently adjusted, the eye should be brought close to the crystal, nearly in contact with it, and on looking into a face, part of the window will be seen reflected, one bar of which must te selected, or a cord stretched across the window, for the experi ment. If the crystal is correctly adjusted, the bar or cord will ap pear horizontal, and on turning the wheel, n, till this bar, reflected, is observed to approach the dark line below, seen in a direct view, it will be found to be parallel to this dark line, and ultimately to coincide with it. If there is not a perfect coincidence, the adjust ment must be altered until this coincidence is obtained. Continue then the revolution of the wheel, n, till the bar or cord is seen by reflection in the next face, and if here there is also a coincidence of the reflected bar or cord with the dark line seen direct, the ad justment is complete ; if not, alterations must be made, and the first face again tried. A few successive trials of the two faces, will enable the observer to obtain a perfect adjustment. After adjustment, 180\u00b0 on the arc should be brought opposite 0 on the vernier. The coincidence of the bar and dark line is then to be obtained, by turning the wheel n, As soon as obtained, the wheel m should be turned until the same coincidence is ob served, by means of the next face of the crystal. If a line on the graduated circle now corresponds with 0 on the vernier, the angle is immediately determined by the number of degrees marked by this line. If no line corresponds with 0, we must observe which line on the vernier coincides with a line on the circle. If it is the 18th on the vernier, and the line on the circle next below 0 on the vernier, marks 125\u00b0, the required angle is 125\u00b0 18' ; if this fine marks 125\u00b0 30', the required angle is 125\u00b0 48'. Some goniometers are furnished with a small polished reflector attached to the foot of the instrument, below the part s q, and placed at an oblique angle so as to reflect a bar of the window."], [135, "127 COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. This is an important improvement, as the reflected bar answers the purpose of the line drawn below tbe window, and is more conven iently used. This reflector may be easily added to the common instruments, placing it at an angle of about 45\u00b0, or such as will reflect the bar to the eye when looking towards the crystal while observing. Mitscherlich 's Goniometer has a small lens mounted in a tube for sighting the crystal ; but the lens diminishes so much the light reflected by the crystal to the eye, that it is not generally ol much value. This instrument is furnished also with a micrometer screw for aid in turning the graduated circle, and certain valuable contrivances for adjusting the crystal. Mohs's Goniometer diners from Wollaston's mainly in having the circle horizontal. Rabinefs Goniometer has a horizontal graduated circle. The crystal is placed at centre on the axis, with the edge vertical. There are two glasses mounted horizontally, with tubes and cross threads, for sighting the crystal : both are attached to the gradu ated arc, one moveable, the other fixed. The crystal is so placed that one face, (of the two including the required angle), on being viewed through the movable glass reflects the sight-threads of the other glass ; it is then turned around till the other glass gives the same reflection. The arc through whicli the crystal is revolved, is then read off on the graduated circle. Adelman?s Goniometer is an ingenious contrivance, made at Paris, combining a common and a reflecting Goniometer. It is much less costly than Wollaston's. , In goniometrical measurements, a knowledge of the simple mathematical principles stated on page 61 are of great importance. For accurate measurements of the angles of crystals, the temper ature of the crystals should be noted ; the angles often change somewhat with a change of temperature, as stated in the remarks on Heat. YI. COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. The compound crystalline structure of minerals is exhibited either in distinct crystals having a composite character, or in ag- ?regated crystallizations. The former are called Compound or \\mn Crystals ; they have regular facets and the same perfection of outline and angle as simple crystals. Compound crystals may be compared to monsters in the animal kingdom. They may be composed of two united crystals, or of several. Compound Crystals,, composed of two individuals, or Twin Crystals. \u2014 Representations of some of these compound forms are"], [136, "128 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. given in the following figures, and in connection with the descrip tions of many species through the succeeding pages of this work. Their structure may be imitated by cutting a model of a crystal in two halves, inverting one ofthe halves, (or revolving it 180\u00b0), and 199 200 then applying it thus inverted to the other half. Fig. 199 is an octahedron, which is re presented as cut in two in the plane abed, If we revolve one half 60\u00b0 or 180\u00b0, and reapply it to the other, it produces the form in I 200. In compound crystals, composition may take place parallel to different secondary planes, but generally it occurs parallel to some face of the fundamental prism, or to the diagonal planes, that is, parallel to planes I, ii, li, or 1. Composition parallel to other faces is occasionally met with. There are two modes in which composition may take place. They may be explained by reference to the method of imitating them, as follows. On dividing a crystal into halves, and holding the plane of division vertical, \u2014 (1). One ofthe halves maybe inverted, as if by revolution 180\u00b0, on a horizontal axis at right angles to the plane of section, and the two again united by the surfaces that were separated. (2). One ofthe halves may be turned around, through 180\u00b0, as if by revolution on a horizontal axis parallel to the plane of sec tion, and the face opposite and parallel to that of the plane of section may then be applied to the other half. 201 202 Fig. 201 represents an oblique prism, bisected vertically along the plane a c. The back planes may be considered as lettered like those in front with the ad dition of an accent. The first of these two modes of compo sition is illustrated in f. 202 ; p m t is inverted so that the back plane m' is in front, in place of to, and^> is at top in place ofp'. In the second mode, t' would be the outer plane instead of I, the latter being the plane of union with P M T; and p' would be at top as before, but m would remain in front. In the junction of the two parts, by this second mode, an obtuse plane angle of one of them comes against an acute of the other, so that the two parts do not fit into a symmet rical solid, unless the acute edges of the prism (the opposite edges a and c) be truncated, which is usually the fact in species in which this mode of composition occurs, viz. Feldspar and Albite. The first of these modes of composition may occur in each of the systems of crystallization, though not always apparent in all, in"], [137, "129 COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. the external form. Examples of it are sometimes distinguished by internal arrangements of color, or by optical characters, when not otherwise recognizable. The second mode is of rare occur rence. In the monometoic system there may be composition in three directions, (1), parallel to an octahedral face or a plane truncating the angle of a cube ; (2), parallel to a dodecahedral face, or a plane truncating the edge of a cube ; (3), parallel to a face of the cube. The first kind produces forms with reentering angles ; and the se cond and third also when occurring in hemihedral forms. Tlie third kind and the second, except in the case mentioned, are not distin guishable by the form, as the inversion of the halves of a cube parallel to a cubic face, or parallel to an edge, produces only a cube still, and no change of the apparent form. Such twins in holohedral forms cannot therefore be recognized by the external form when they occur. Fig. 200 represents a twin of the first of these kinds ; it occurs in Spinel, Magnetite, &c. \"When the form is shortened parallel to the plane of union, it becomes tabular, and is sometimes quite thin tabular. Fig. 203 exhibits the same kind of composition in a dodeca- hedron. One half, as in the case of the octahedron, is revolved 60\u00b0, (or the result is equivalent to this). In a cube it pro duces a solid made up of two cubes united by their angles, parallel to an octahedral plane. In a form like f. 34, the result is similar in kind, but sometimes the six faces about one solid angle, and the six about the diagonally opposite, form .together a twin having the form of a low double six-sided pyramid, resembling somewhat f. 89, as in Native Copper, the interme diate parts being absent, 185 is an example in the Diamond. In f. 273 of Blende, a revolution of 60\u00b0 produces the solid m f. 273 A. In the dimetric system twins may occur parallel to (1) the basal plane (0) of a prism ; (2) a lateral plane, ii ; (3) a vertical diag onal plane I ; (4) a plane replacing a basal edge of the prism %%, usually plane li; (5) a plane replacing an angle, usually plane 1. Only the last two kinds are marked by reentering angles in holo hedral forms, or are recognizable except it be by optical characters, while all may be distinguished in hemihedral forms. The annexed fig. 204 represents a square prism terminating m a pyramid, divided by a diagonal section ; andf. 205 shows the form resulting from revolving one of the halves thus formed 180\u00b0. It is common in tin ore, (Cassiterite). 17"], [138, "130 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The square octahedron li or 1 gives rise to twins by composition parallel to one of its faces, similar to f. 200, but of less symmetrical character, a process that may be instructively followed through by cutting out models. A form of this kind is represented in f. 295 ; composition is parallel to li. Tabular forms may result with this kind of composition ; and thin tables thus formed are sometimes aggregated, or, as it were, piled up, together. In the trimetric system composition may occur in the same di rections as in the dimetric ; and as the lateral axes are unequal, twins formed by composition parallel to these axes, (as to planes Bor 11), are different in kind. Composition parallel to the axial sections, as ii or ii, does not produce twins recognizable as such by external form ; but when it takes place parallel to the plane I, (f. 4, 22, 24), as these planes form a rhombic prism, there are reentering angles, as shown in Aragonite, (q. v.) An example of composition par allel to plane li is given in f. 332, under Manganite. In the oblique systems, twins parallel to the axial sections may have reentering planes, or planes in abnormal positions, as a result of the composition, as well as those formed by composition in other directions. Fig. 357 (Augite) represents an example of com position parallel to ii, the simple form of whicli is shown in f. 350. Fig. 362 is another in Hornblende ; f. 361 is the simple form. Fig. 415, 416 (Albite) are examples of composition parallel to ii ; the former, by an inversion of the first kind, and the other of the second kind, described on page 128. Fig. 424, 425, are twins of Orthoclase, compounded parallel to ii, similar to the last men tioned of Albite. In f. 428 composition is parallel to 2i. Gypsum and several other species afford additional examples. In the hexagonal system, twins of rhombohedral forms occur compounded (1) parallel to the terminal plane O (OR) ; (2) the prismatic planes I or 02 : the rhombohedral faces (R) ; (4) planes truncating the terminal edges, or \u2014 IR \u25a0 (5) rarely parallel to the face of the pyramid 1-2 and the rhombohedron \u2014 2R. When composition is parallel to O. the twin appears as if made"], [139, "COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. 131 by a revolution through 60\u00b0 of one half of the simple crystal, the axis of revolution being the vertical axis of the prism. Several figures under Calcite (q. v.) are forms of this kind. A similar mode of composition produces the form in f. 300 A, (Pyrargyrite) ; the hexagonal prism of the simple crystal has its alternate edges truncated ; and in the compound form (produced through a revo lution of one half 60\u00b0) this truncation appears on half of each edge alternately above ancl below. Composition parallel to I is repre sented hi one of the forms of Calcite, (q. v.) Composition parallel to R occurs in Calcite, Chabazite, Quartz, &c. Composition par allel to \\R is met with in Calcite and Pyrargyrite ; see f. 300. Composition parallel to \u2014 2R is exemplified under Calcite, (q. v.) Composition parallel to the pyramid 1-2, or an edge of the common pyramid of Quartz, sometimes occurs, (f. 342). In the compound forms which have been described, the crystal is generally as complete and well finished as the simple form, and it is obvious that the formation of the twin commenced with the nucleal molecule, which itself possessed the compound character, or consisted essentially of two molecules. Such twins are prop erly paragenic ; and they are distinct from another kind, meta genic, in which the composition took place subsequently to the commencement of the crystal. In metagenic twins, the two parts of the twin are not united along a diagonal section, but by parts more or less distant from the proper centre of either. Such are the forms represented in f. 345, 346, (Quartz). A mode of metagenic composition is 206 observed in doubly geniculated crystals, as those of Rutile, annexed figure. The gen iculations take place at equal distances either side of the centre of the crystal, and are evidently the result of some cause acting after the crystal had begun to form. The geniculation is usually parallel to a plane of common occurrence, either, one of those of the fundamental form, or its simplest modifications. This geniculation often is frequently repeated in the same crystal, and thus the ends of a crystal are, by successive geniculations, bent around together or into Rutile- one another, as happens in Rutile. Compound Crystals composed of more than two Individuals. \u2014 In the monometric system, in which the axes are all equal, the composition occurring along one octahedral section may occur parallel to all such sections alike ; and hence comes a compound form of pyrites, (f. 282 A), made up of pentagonal dodecahedrons. It corresponds to an interpenetration of two pentagonal dodecahe-"], [140, "132 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. drons, a right and a left, (+ and \u2014 ). Li a similar manner there re sults the compound form represented in f. 306, which becomes very complex when the crystals are highly modified. Fig. 272 A, represents a crystal of Galena of this kind,_ distorted, by being shortened in the direction of an octahedral axis. In tetrahedral forms, composition parallel to the cubic faces pro duces the form in f. 207, which may be viewed as made of two interpenetrating tetrahedrons. By this method is formed the twin of Diamond represented in f. 267 A. With the compo sition parallel to an octahe dral face, the form in f. 208 is produced, also made of two interpenetrating tetra hedrons. It illustrates the 207 208 origin of the twin of Gray Copper in f. 303 A. In the dimetric system, the eight octahedral sections are similar to one another, as in the monometric, aud hence there may be com position simultaneously parallel to all. Yery complicated forms are thus produced in Copper Pyrites and Tin Ore. Fig. 295 A, represents one of the occurring forms of Copper Pyrites. 209 In the trimetric system, cruciform and stel- late crystals are common. Fig. 209 represents a form in chrysoberyl. Other varieties are shown in f. 233, 234, 236, beyond ; others under Staurotide, Aragonite, Cerusite, and Harmo tome. In the stellate forms, the compound crystals consist of three or six rays, when the angle of the prism is near 120\u00b0, or one-third of 360\u00b0, and fide rays when about one-fifth of 360\u00b0, as in Marcasite. In rhombohedral species, as Pyrargyrite, Chabazite, Levyne, and Cinnabar, compound crystals occur, which in the simplest form resemble f. 306 of Fluor spar. They may be viewed as formed by the interpenetration of two rhombohedrons a + and a \u2014 , with the vertical axis as the axis of composition, or by a composition of six crystals united parallel to the prismatic planes I. In Ilmenite, anal- 210 ogous forms occur ; by composition, upon the form in f. 314, compound crystals nearly similar in their faces to f. 313, are produced. Stellate forms also occur in the rhombo hedral system, as represented in the accom panying figure of a crystal of snow, (f. 210). Another form of compound crystal in this system is represented in f. 300, under Pyrargyrite. It consists of four crystals, united parallel to the faces \u2014 |R."], [141, "COMPOUND* CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. 133 Crystals are often grouped in linear series, as in Native Cop per and Silver, and thus constitute long threads or reticulations. In clustered crystals, it is generally a fact that adjoining crystals are parallel in position, and united by a plane parallel to one of the principal sections or planes of common occurrence. Senar mont mentions the union in Galena parallel to the octahedral faces as common ; and he also describes an instance where the union was parallel to the plane 3-f . The positions of crystals on the supporting rock seem at first to be without any regularity. By closer inspection we detect even here the same law of harmony that governs the formation of the simple and compound crystal. The various positions assumed cor respond generally with the more common kinds of composition in twin crystals. Brooke observes with respect to certain artificial crystallizations of nitrate of lead, that some of the octahedrons \" had their axes perpendicular to the surfaces on which they rested\" \u2014 -\"others rested on one of their planes, and others were attached by an edge to the bottom of the vessel ;\" thus exemplify ing three kinds of composition. This regularity is not always manifest on account of the unevenness of the surface on which they rest. In general, however, on glancing the eye over a surface covered with crystals, a reflection from one face will be accom panied with reflections from the corresponding face in each of the other crystals, showing that the crystals are similar -throughout in their positions. * This tendency to parallelism in the positions of associated cystals is even apparent in crystalline aggregates. In granite, for example, which is composed of feldspar, quartz, and mica, the feldspar crys tallizations have usually a common position ; that is, the corres ponding extremities lie in the same direction, or nearly so. On this account granite is cleavable in one direction more easily than in others, and this direction is that of the perfect cleavage plane of the feldspar. The parallel positions of the mica in gneiss causes the fissile character of that rock. In some cases also, crystals of different minerals associated to gether take a parallel or continuous position. Thus crystals of Albite and Feldspar, and of Staurotide and Kyanite, at times have this relation ; and Breithaupt has observed the same between crys tals of Rutile and Specular iron, the crystals of Rutile in this case having the vertical axis in the direction of a lateral axis of the Specular iron. Haidinger has observed Pyroxene and Hornblende crystals associated in parallel positions. A prism of Calcite terminating in the planes \u2014 J, has been ob served, in which each plane \u2014 \u00a3 was covered with small crystals of quartz all lying symmetrically, with their pyramids pointing towards the summit. The subject of twin crystals will receive further illustration in the chapter on Crystallogeny."], [142, "134 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. Yn. CRYSTALLINE AGGREGATES AND AMORPHOUS VARIETIES. The greater part of the specimens or masses of minerals that occur on our globe, may be described as aggregations of imperfect crystals. Even those whose structure appears the most purely im palpable, and the most destitute internally of anything like crys tallization, are probably composed of crystalline grains. We, consequently, include under the above head, all the remaining varieties of structure in the mineral kingdom. The only certain exceptions are bquids and gases, which require so few remarks, that a separate caption for them is imnecessary. The individuals composing imperfectly crystallized individuals, may be, 1. Columns, or fibres, in which case the structure is columnar. 2. Thin lamin\u00e6, producing a lamellar structure. 3. Grains, constituting a granular structure. 1. Columnar Structure. A mineral possesses a columnar structure, when it is made up of slender columns or fibres. There are the following varieties of the columnar structure: \u2014 Fibrous: when.the columns or fibres are parallel. Ex. gypsum, asbestus. Fibrous minerals have often a silky lustre. Reticulated: when the fibres or columns cross in various direc tions, and produce an appearance having some resemblance to a net. Stellated or stellular : when they radiate from a centre in all directions, and produce star-like forms. Ex. stilbite, wavellite. Radiated, divergent: when the crystals radiate from a centre, without producing stellar forms. Ex. quartz, gray antimony. 2. Lamella/r Structwe. The structure of a mineral is lamellar, when it consists of plates or leaves. The lamin\u00e6 may be curved or straight, and thus give rise to the curved lamellar, and straight lamellar structure. Ex. tabular spar, some varieties of gypsum, talc,\" &c. When the lamin\u00e6 are thm and easily separable, the structure is said to be foliaceous. Mica is a striking example, and the term micaceous' is often used to describe this kind of structure. 3. Gremiular Structure. The particles in a granular structure differ much in size. When coarse, the mineral is described as coarsely granular : when fine, finely granular ; and if not distinguishable by the naked eye, the structure is termed impalpable. Examples of the first may be"], [143, "COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. 135 observed in granular carbonate of lime ; of the second, in some varieties of specular iron ; of the last, in chalcedony, opal, and other species. The above terms are indefinite, but from necessity, as there is every degree of fineness of structure in the mineral species, from perfectly impalpable, through all possible shades, to the coarsest granular. The term phanero-crystalline has been used for varieties in which the grains are distinct, and crypto-crystalline, for those in which they are not discernible. Granular minerals, when easily crumbled in the fingers, are said to be friable. 4. Imitative Shapes. Reniform : kidney shape. The structure may be radiating or concentric. Rotryoidcd : consisting of a group of rounded prominences. The name is derived from the Greek Gorgus, \u00ab bunch of grapes. Ex. linionite, chalcedony. Mammillary : resembbng the botryoidal, but composed of larger prominences. Globular : spherical or nearly so ; the globules may consist of radiating fibres or concentric coats. When attached, as they usu ally are, to the surface of a rock, they are described as implanted globules. Nodular : in tuberose forms, or having irregular protuberances over the surface. Amygdaloidal : almond-shaped, applied usually to a greenstone containing almond-shaped or sub-globular nodules. Coralloidal: like coral, or consisting of interlaced fle.xuous branchings of a white color, as in some arragonite. Dendritic : branching tree-like. Mossy : like moss in form or appearance. Filiform or Capillcury : very slender and long like a thread or ha.ir. Acicular : slender and rigid like a needle. Reticulated : net-like. Drusy : closely covered with minute implanted crystals. Stalactitic : when the mineral occurs in pendant columns, cylin ders, or elongated cones. Stalactites are produced by the percolation of water, holding \"mineral matter in solution, through the rocky roofs of caverns. The evaporation of the water produces a deposit of the mineral matter, and gradually forms a long pendant cylinder or cone. The internal structure may be imperfectly crystalline and granular, or may consist of fibres radiating from the central column, or may have a broad cross-cleavage. Common stalactites consist of carbonate of lime. Chalcedony,"], [144, "136 CRYSTALLOGENY. gibbsite, brown iron ore, and many other species, also present sta lactitic forms. Amorphous : baving no regular structure or form either crys talline or imitative. The word is from a.,privitive, and f*op<pr|, shape. YHI. PSEUDOMORPHOUS CRYSTALS. A pseudomorphous crystal possesses a form that is foreign to the species to ichich the substance belongs. Crystals sometimes undergo a change of composition from aque ous agency or some other cause, without losing their form : for ex ample, octahedrons of spinel change to steatite, still retaining the octahedral form ; cubes of pyrites are altered to red or brown iron ore ; anhydrite becomes gypsum by the addition of water: or crys tals are sometimes removed entirely, and another mineral is sub stituted ; as, for example, cubes of fluor spar may be transformed to quartz, without a change of form. Iii these and other ways, many minerals appear under a form of crystallization which does not belong to the species. The discus sion of the origin and chemical relations of pseudomorphs will be more properly considered in the chapter on Chemical Mineralogy. Pseudomorphous crystals are distinguished, generally, by their rounded angles, dull surfaces, and often granular composition. They either have no cleavage, or the cleavage is wholly different in direction from that of the mineral imitated. Their surfaces are frequently drusy, or covered with minute crystals. Occasionally the resemblance to real crystals is so perfect, that they are distin guished with difficulty. SECTION H. CRYSTALLOGENY. Crystallogeny, or the formation of crystals, may be discussed either from a practical point of view, by treating of the processes of crystallization and attendant circumstances ; or theoretically, by considering the nature of molecular attraction in crystallization, and the laws under which it acts. Under the former head, only a few of the causes that determine the modifications of form in crys tal are here mentioned, as a full discussion of the methods of crys tallizing minerals by art belongs rather to chemical science."], [145, "137 PRACTICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. I. PRACTICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. Crystallization may take place \u2014 from a solution of a crys tallizable material ; from a state of fusion by heat ; from a state of vapor, another condition dependent on temperature ; from a solid state without fusion, under a continued elevation of temperature. The crystallization of sugar or alum is a common example of the first mode ; the formation of ice, of the second ; the production of snow from vapor, of the third ; and the usual mode of hardening steel, (since it depends on varying the size or system of crystallization of the crystalline grains), is an example of the fourth. All solidi fication of inorganic matter is probably crystallization, and the solid condition is arrived at in one or the other of these methods. Frequently, however, the solid is formed immediately upon the combination of the elements that constitute it, or upon the libera tion of the substance from some other state of combination. The formation of distinct crystals usually requires a freedom from disturbing causes, a slow rate of progress in the process, and a large supply of material, or else a gradual supply from some constant source. In nmny instances a crystal that has been long out of a solution, may be restored and further enlarged. Crystallization without a change from the solid state, is well illustrated by facts mentioned to the author by Mr. N. P. Ames. If a bar of tempered steel, bent in the form of a semicircle, be heated on the inner side, when the heat has reached a certain point, the bar may easily be bent around and made to curve in tbe oppo- site direction. He states that until the moment when the requisite temperature is acquired, the bar does not yield ; but at this mo- ment, a change takes place which is distinctly felt in the hands, and the bar at once bends. He carefully measured the inner and outer curves of the bar, after thus bending it, and found them of the same length as before. This shows that there had been no compression of the particles on the inner side, which would have shortened that side, and therefore, also, that there was actually a freedom of motion among the particles on either side. He ob- serves, moreover, that the elasticity of the inner and outer sides was the same, which would not have been the case were the former compressed. By the old method of restoring a warped swTord-blade it was rendered unequally elastic, and would spring more easily on one side than the other ; but by the means here explained, the elas- ticity is perfectly equal on both sides. Here, then, there is a change in the position of the particles throughout tbe bar, pro- duced by a temperature very far short of fusion. The same ex periment was often repeated, and he found that, at every time he bent the steel, the temperature required was a little above that at which it bent the preceding time. The change resulting from fric tion or long repeated concussion, is probably owing to the com- 18"], [146, "138 CRYSTALLOGENY. bined action of the heat thus excited, and the vibration that takes place. Mr. Ames states instances in which a large bar of iron, used as an axle through a heavy wheel of cast iron, broke square off in the middle, after use for a few months ; and in one case, there were two other fractures on either side of the^ centre. In these instances, the bar was rendered coarsely crystalline, and was wholly unlike the original iron. Causes of secondary planes. \u2014 Beudant, in his treatise on Miner alogy, in which this subject has received some attention, states as the principal cause of secondary planes, the nature of the solvent, and of the substances it holds in solution. He remarks, that when the solvent contains, mechanically sus pended, minute particles of foreign matter, the crystals formed con tain more or less of these foreign particles regularly arranged, either in concentric layers with the lamin\u00e6 of the crystal, or in the direction of a diagonal, or occasionally intermingled without regu lar order ; and that the crystals thus impure, are more simple and regular than those obtained from a clear liquid. Crystals of quartz are seldom perfectly regular bipyramidal prisms, except when they contain large portions of chlorite or oxyd of iron. But if the sol vent contains other substances in solution, either solid, liquid, or gaseous, secondary forms are usually produced. \" Common salt, crystallizing from pure water, presents, almost invariably, a cubic form. But in a solution of boracic acid, it always occurs with trun cated angles,\" (f. 15). The Rev. E. Craig, in an interesting article on Microscopic Chemistry, in the Lond. and Ed. Phil. Mag. and Jour, of Science, July, 1836, p. 13, states the following remark able transformations in crystals of carbonate of copper, produced by a change in the nature of the solvent : \" If sulphuric acid be added to carbonate of copper, crystals speedily appear presenting the form of six-sided tabular prisms. Add a little ammonia, the form is changed entirely to a long rectangular prism, with the angles replaced. Add a little more ammonia, and the form changes to several varieties of the rhombic octahedron : a little nitric acid restores again the form of the rectangular prism. In all these suc cessive changes, it is not that a few crystals of another form have been superadded, but each time the metamorphosis is seen to take place in the whole mass.\" There are many evidences that the same cause has operated in nature to produce the peculiar secondary planes a crystal presents. Aragonite, in iron mines, crystallizes in very acute pyramidal crys tals ; but in the gypsum clays, accompanying the saliferous depos its, it always appears in prismatic crystals, grouped so as to form hexagonal prisms. Other similar instances might be added ; but this will suffice to establish the fact, that secondary planes often arise from the peculiar nature of the solvent. Another cause may be the electrical state of the rock support-"], [147, "139 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. ing the crystal, and also its nature. M. Planiava has observed that, in some instances, in which the form of the floating crystal was the primary, it assumed secondary planes as soon as it attached itself to the sides of the vessel.* In some instances, secondary planes proceed from some perma nent peculiarity in the molecule ; for, without this supposition, we cannot account for the invariableness in the occurrence of a par ticular secondary form of some minerals ; for example, the pris matic form in quartz, whose primary is a rhombohedron. The influence of magnetism or electricity on crystallisation has received some attention, especially from Mr. Robert Hunt. By placing the poles of a horse-shoe magnet against a glass vessel or a plate of glass, in or on wdiich crystallization was in progress, he has found the crystals to be guided in their positions by the poles of a magnet. The facts he has developed have a bearing upon .the uniformity of position in crystallizations over large areas. But other causes have aided in directing the crystalline structure of rocks, and among them the pressure to which the material was subjected during crystallization may be the most important. f M. Lavalle has shown, (L'lnstitut, 1853, 90), among his results, that when a crystal of alum lies on one of its sides, as it enlarges, the under surface and the opposite, if there is one similar, enlarge more than the rest ; and if an angle be cut off and it be laid on this face thus made, a similar plane forms on the opposite angle, but not on the others ; and if all the edges are removed by solution, the crys tal will complete again every edge and angle. Brewster has made some very remarkable investigations on the optical figures which reflected light exhibits upon the surfaces of crystals acted on by solvents, showing the points or directions oi weakest cohesion. Phil. Mag. 1853, [4], v, 16. II. THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. THEORIES OF VARIOUS AUTHORS. Speculations on the nature of molecules have displayed the in genuity of men of science in various ages of the world. The Gre cian philosophers, to account for the various phenomena in nature, imagined the ultimate particles of matter to be at different times \" round, oval, lenticular, flat, gibbous, oblong, conical, smooth, rough, quadrilateral,\"^:, and, to afford these atoms the means of uniting in the production of compounds, provided them with hooks. * Kastner's Archiv.

Sci, [2], iii, 393, 394, where there are references to writers on this point. \\ Epicurus."], [148, "140 CRYSTALLOGENY. The investigations of modern times have not, indeed, answered the inquiry, what is this plastic power in nature ; but philosophers have been led to satisfy themselves with calling it by the general tenn, attraction, a term rather expressing the fact, that particles com bine, than explaining the nature of this power. This subject lay uninvestigated, from the times of the ancient philosophers till the 13th century.* From the 13th to the 17th century, appeared Albertus Magnus,f Agricola,^ C\u00e6salpinus,\u00a7 Boe tius de Boot,|| Baptista von Helinont,^\" Christian Huygens,** Boyle,ff and many others, who advanced various hypotheses as to the seeds of crystals, their generation, &c. But, excepting Huy gens, who in a very recondite treatise first developed the doubly refracting nature of Iceland spar, and inferred that its elementary particles were spheroids, to account for this peculiar refraction, none made any real improvements on the speculations of their prede cessors. With Nicolaus Steno, towards the latter part of the 17th cen tury, commences a new era. This author examined minutely the different forms of several minerals, and first deduced the important principle afterwards rediscovered, that, although the faces of crys tals are subject to sequent variations of form, their inclinations remain constant.%% In the commencement of the 18th century, Gulielmini publisbed on the crystallizations of the salts, and ad vanced another principle equally fundamental, that cleavage in crystals of the same substance yields constantly the same forms. Gulielmini was led, by his observations, to the same conclusions as * Many of the following facts have been cited from a valuable work on the His tory of Crystallography, by Dr. C. M.

Several writers on these subjects appeared during the half cen tury following Gulielmini ; but they made no essential additions to facts. \u2014 The theory of tetrahedral atoms was proposed by Ludwig Bourguet.f J. Woodward makes quartz crystal the source of all crystalliza tions, concerning whicli he thus expresses himself in his treatise on his collection of \" English Fossils,\" X P- 146 : \" There is in all spar more or less crystal, which renders it more or less diaphanous,\" &c. Again, p. 220 : \" Crystal, pure and without mixture of other matter, concretes even into an hexagonal figure, pyramidal or columnar, terminating in an apex or point. Mineral or metallic matter con creting with it, frequently determines it to other figures peculiar to the disposition of each kind of that matter. Iron concreting with crystal, determines it to a rhomboidal figure ; tin, to a quadrilate ral pyramid ; lead, to a cubic.\" Somewhat similar was the opinion of Linn\u00e6us, who supposed that all crystals contained a salt, and to this owed their crystalliza tions This theory obtained considerable credit at that time. We find it clearly expressed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1749, p. 250, by W. Borlase : \" 'Tis by the force of salts that liquid bodies are thrown into all the geometrical planes, angles, and more com pounded shapes, the variety of which is no less surprising, than the constancy and uniformity of each particular species.\" The discov eries in chemistry soon dissipated these views, and at last established philosophers on this settled ground, that the power of crystallization is naturally and independently inherent in all inorganic matter. Immediately preceding the commencement of the Abbe Haiiy's very successful scientific career, appeared Bergman, Werner, and Rome de Lisle. Bergman has the honor of discovering the funda mental forms of crystals, and Rome de Lisle that of first measuring * De Salibus Dissertatio epistolaris physico-medico-mechanica conscripta a Domi nico Gulielmini; Lugd.

Haiiy seems to have entered on his studies with an entire ignorance ofthe results of Bergman and Gulielmini, and in all his observations was an original investigator. A mere accident, the dropping of a crystal from his hands and its fracture in conse quence, exhibited to him the rhombohedral particles of carbonate of lime. He was thus led to commence his investigations, and with his philosophic mind soon arrived at general conclusions with re gard to the primary forms. \u2014 An obvious theory as to their struc ture, that already proposed by Gulielmini, was the next result of his investigations. The primary cube he imagined to be constituted of cubic molecules, for cubes, and cubes only, can be obtained by mechanical division. Similarly, the rhombohedron was formed of rhombohedral molecules. Investigations, with respect to the situation of secondary planes, and the laws which govern their formation, gave Haiiy what ap peared to be additional proof of the correctness of his theory. _ He discovered that the secondary planes on the edges of crystals might be exactly imitated by composing a primary of its molecules, and dropping one row (or, in his phraseology, by a decrement of one 211 212 row) of particles in height and breadth, (f. 211), or, two rows in one direction, and one in the other, (f. 212), and so in some simple ratio for all planes. These splendid results proved that the science of Crystallography was founded on a mathematical basis, and they seemed to establish the truth of Haiiy's views, on the same sure foundation. It appeared, however, to be a difficulty, that cleavage was ob tained, in some instances parallel to two primaries at the same time. The rhombic prism, besides its rhombic cleavage, admitted of cleavage parallel to a diagonal, thus dividing it into two three sided prisms. Again, octahedrons could not be composed of octa hedral molecules, except by leaving large spaces, to fill which, tet rahedrons were necessary. Haiiy surmounted the first difficulty, by supposing the molecules to be composed of still simpler sobds, which he called integrant molecules. These are the tetrahedron, the three-sided prism, and the parallelepiped. The second diffi culty, however, remained, and could only be avoided by the im probable hypothesis of two nucleal solids, an octahedron, and a tetrahedron. The difficulties lay unremoved, when Dr. Wollaston brought forward his ingenious views on the spherical forms of the mole cules of bodies, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1813. It is easily conceived, that many of the primary solids in crystallog-"], [151, "THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 143 raphy may be formed by the regular aggregation of spheres. Two four-sided pyramids of shot, (similar to those frequently seen in arsenals), placed base to base, form the regular octahedron, (f. 213). If, to the octahedron, two three sided pyramids are added, tetrahedrons, 218 214: one to each of two opposite faces, a rhombohedron is formed, (f. 214). A rhombohedron of this kind is easily ob tained in the cleaving of fluor spar ; it is reduced to the octahedron by separating two tetrahedrons. Rhombohedrons, however, occur of various angles. To obtain these, it is only necessary to suppose the particles of other rhombohedrons to be spheroids, instead of spheres ; spheroids are also his molecules of the prisms. The formation of the cube is illustrated by Dr. Wollaston, as follows : \" Let a mass of matter be supposed to consist of spherical particles, all of the same size, but of two dif ferent kinds in equal numbers, represented by black and white balls ; and let it be required that, in their perfect intermixture, every black ball shall be equally distant from all surrounding white balls, and that all adjacent balls of the same denomination shall also be equidistant from each other. I say, then, that these conditions will be fulfilled, if the arrangement be cubical, and that the particles will be in equilibrio.\" He had previously stated, that \" a cube may evidently be put together of spherical particles, arranged four and four above each other ; but this is not the form which simple spheres are naturally disposed to assume, and, con sequently, this hypothesis alone is not adequate to its explanation.\" This theory is in some respects far more simple than that of Haiiy. Yet it is manifest that it received but sparingly the atten tion of the philosophic mind of Dr. Wollaston. The cube and rhombohedron are similar solids, differing merely in that the latter is oblique. It is surely improbable, that their atomic arrange ments should be as different as Wollaston's theory supposes ; or with reference to the cube alone, that its formation, or even the explanation of it, should require two kinds of particles. Other theories have been proposed, but only one seems to de mand a notice in this place, before entering upon that which ap pears to afford the best explanation of the phenomena. I refer to the Chemical theory, as it may be called, since chemical facts are usually explained by a reference to its principles. According to this theory, the atoms of the elements are either spheres or sphe roids, and the molecules of compounds result from a juxtaposition of the elementary atoms. These elementary atoms, moreover, are so arranged, that the compound molecule has the sbape of the pri mary form of the compound."], [152, "144 CRYSTALLOGENY. It will be remembered that crystals are solids of definite dimen- sions, and constant angles, exhibiting a perfect symmetry in their several parts, and an exact regularity in the occurrence of second- ary planes. In order, therefore, that the similar parts of a crystal should be similarly modified, there should be a corresponding similarity in the different parts of a molecule. The molecule of the cube, besides having the form of a cube, should present a uni- formity of character on its six opposite parts, corresponding to the faces of the cube. Such molecules, it is evident, cannot be formed by the juxtaposition of the elementary atoms. An atom of sulphur, the fundamental form of which is a rhombic octahedron, united to an atom of lead, whose primary is the regular octahedron, could not in any way be made to receive the cubic form of galena. Nor were the molecules equal spheres, would it be a less difficult task ; and if the form were possible, still the compound molecule would not contain similar atoms in its similar parts, and could not possess that symmetrical character necessary to account for the regularity in the ocurrence of secondary planes. Such examples might be multiplied indefinitely. The chemical theory is equally unsatisfactory, in all attempts to account for crystallographic phenomena. Indeed, it may be con- sidered as formed merely for illustrating combinations in a lecture room. In the explanations of optical phenomena, it has been re jected by the principal theorists, who, in accounting for the double refraction of crystals, suppose the molecules to have spherical and ellipsoidal forms, and a homogeneous structure. Without further introduction, I proceed to explain what is con ceived to be the most probable view of the nature of molecules and molecular action in the formation of crystals. ON CRYSTALLINE MOLECULES.* By crystalline molecule is understood, the molecule in the state peculiar to it, when about to enter into the constitution of a crystal, or when a constituent part of a crystal. Evidently, some important change takes place in molecules, at the time of crys tallization. The moment before, when in the liquid state, they are in close connection, but move freely among themselves ; in the act of crystallization, they unite, almost instantaneously, and are firmly compacted in the hard, unyielding crystal. Forms ' of Molecules.\u2014 Adopting the idea of spherical and spheroidal molecules, we suppose the molecule of each primary to * The following views on crystallogeny were first published by the author in the American Journal of Science, 1836, xxx, 275, in an article on the formation of Compound or Twin Crystals."], [153, "THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 145 be that spheroidal body or ellipsoid,* which, described within the prism, touches the centres of its faces. These molecules, by their aggregation, will build up the same forms that proceed from the aggregation of Haiiy's polyhedral molecules ; for they have the same proportional height, breadth, and thickness, and therefore, by combination, must produce a solid of the same dimensions.f Such molecules are potentially correct representatives of the forces of attraction indicated by the forms and structure of crystals, whether actualities or not. Crystallogenic Attraction, \u2014 Crystallogenic attraction, and the attraction exerted in solidification, appear to be one and the same : and consequently the subject before us is that of solidification in general. Attraction acting in every direction from the centre of a par ticle, will cause an addition of particles in no fixed direction, and * The following remarks are made in explanation ofthe solids, termed ellipsoids or solid eclipses, and their conjugate axes and diameters. A A ' R\"R' ac a aal \u25a0,,,.. . I 1 a a a. , . A Tt A'R' +TaT/a laaa aaaa /avnaaciTaC it AA' BB' is a plane ellipse. AB, A'B', two lines crossing at right angles, are termed its conjugate axes ; a'b', ab, are conjugate diameters. The relative situation of the conjugate diameters is such, that if a line be drawn, touching the ellipse at a, the extremity of one diameter, ab, it will be parallel to the other a'b'. When ab and a'b' are equal, they are termed the equal conjugate diameters ; when they intersect at right angles, they are conjugate axes. The revolution of a plane semi-ellipse, AB'B, around one axis, describes the surface of a solid, which is denominated an ellipsoid of revolution. The ellipsoid of revolution has its sections in one direction, circles. If these sections are ellipses, the solid is still an ellipsoid, but .not one of revolu- tion, as the simple revolution of a plane ellipse will not describe it. The axes of ellipsoids are three, and intersect at right angles. The three conjugate diameters are any lines so drawn that a plane touching the ellipsoid at the ex tremity of one, is parallel to the plane in which the other diameters are situated. Each face of a prism, which touches the ellipsoid at the extremity of one crystallo genic axis, is necessarily parallel to the plane in which the other two axes are situated. Consequently, the crystallogenic axes (lines connecting the centres of opposite faces) are always the conjugate diameters of the ellipsoid, and, if they in tersect at right angles, they are the conjugate axes. f The above approaches the view of Brewster, deduced from the study of the refraction of crystallized and other substances, and published in 1830; but this philosopher considers the form ofthe molecule not that of the spheroid which may be inscribed within a primary, but another spheroid of such dimensions that the change of form superinduced upon it by the forces of aggregation determines the exact form of the combination. The form of the ultimate molecules of crystals existing separately, are regarded as determining only within certain limits the prim itive form to which they belong ; while the precise form of the crystal and its doubly refracting structure are produced by the action of the forces of aggregation. The theory is suggested by the fact that compression will give a doubly refracting structure to glass and other substances not otherwise possessing it. The progress of science will probably soon clear up these doubtful points. See Brewster on Double Refraction, Transactions Royal Society for 1830, and American Journal of Science, xxi, 296 ; also an article by the author, American Journal of Science, [2], iv, 364. 19"], [154, "146 CRYSTALLOGENY. must invariably produce a spherical solid. Proof of this fact is observed in every drop of water, or globule of mercury, whose sphe ricity results from this condition of attraction. To form solids, bounded by a definite number of surfaces, there must be a definite number of directions for the exertion of attraction. If attraction is exerted in but one direction, the particles will unite only in this direction, and by their union will form only a single line of spheres; exertion in two directions will, in a similar manner, produce a figure of two dimensions only, that is, a plane ; in three direc tions, a figure of three dimensions, or a solid bounded by six faces, as the cube. For the construction of prisms, it is therefore neces sary that the mutual attraction of the particles be strongest in three directions in each molecule. These directions may be denominated axes, and their extrem ities, poles ; the two, relatively, -positive and negative, or north and south, This polar character is a fundamental law of molecu lar force. In each instance, the axes connect the centres of the faces or opposite edges of the prism ; action in these directions will produce solids like the prisms. , The attraction within a molecule is not supposed to be confined to the extremities of the axes. On the contrary, every portion of the surface exerts attraction. But the attraction is strongest at the poles, and weakest at an intermediate point between them. The crystallogenic axes of the cube are three equal lines inter secting each other at right angles, and hence the molecule is a sphere, with three equal conjugate axes, as axes of attraction, (f. 215). Influenced by these axes, the' spheres will combine, as in f. 216, and a cube will be formed in the same manner as by the aggregation of an equal number of cubes. The square prism has its breadth and width equal, but a varying length ; and the mole- cule, consequently, is an ellipsoid of revolution, (f. 217), with rect angular axes. The rectangular prism has three unequal dimen sions, and therefore the ellipsoidal molecule is not an ellipsoid of revolution. Fig. 218 is a transverse section of the prism and ellip soid. The axes are rectangular, as in the preceding forms. The right rhombic prism has a similar molecule to that of the rect angular prism, but its lateral crystallogenic axes, which connect the centres of opposite faces, are obliquely inclined to one another ; and being equal, are the equal conjugate diameters, instead of con-"], [155, "THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 147 jugate axes, (f. 219). The vertical axis, as in the preceding prisms, is still one of the conjugate axes. The same is the 220 fact with the right rhomboidal prism ; but its lateral axes are unequal, and may be any unequal conjugate diameters of the ellipsoid, at right angles with the vertical axis. In the preceding, we suppose that both the rhombic and rectangular prisms may be crystallogenically primary prisms. In the oblique prisms, the vertical axis is inclined, and is not therefore one of the conjugate axes, but a conjugate diameter to each of the lateral axes, which are also conjugate diameters. The lateral conjugate diameters are equal in the rhombic, but unequal in the rhomboidal prism. In the rhombohedron, the lines connect- ing the centres of opposite faces are equal, and consequently the ellipsoid is one of revolution, and the three crystallogenic axes, its equal conjugate diameters, (f. 221 and 222).* A comprehensive view of the molecules and their axes is given in the following table : Prisms, all of whose cryst. axes intersect at I axes equal \u2014 Cube. right angles, and are therefore conjugate -J two only equal \u2014 Pt.

Moreover, we perceive that all the prismatic primaries may pro- * The rhombohedron thus formed differs materially from that proposed by Wollas ton, (f. 135).

It has been stated that the axes of attraction have polarity. It may be inferred, with reference to the rhombohedron, that the three poles about each vertical solid angle are of the same name, those about one, north, and those about the other, south ; in crys tals of tourmaline there is then some correspondence between the crystallogenic poles and those induced by heat. The polarity in any case must vary with the condition or position of the crystal with reference to surrounding matter. Examples of a change from such a cause are found in some compound crystals, alluded to on a following page. Laws governing the Crystalline Molecules in the formation of the Primary Solids. \u2014 The molecules of matter in the act of crys tallization, must be subservient to the usual law of attraction, the repulsion of like poles amd the attraction of unlike ; that is, two norths or two souths repel, a north and a south mutually attract. There is this peculiarity, that only the unlike poles of similar axes can unite. An attraction exists between the north pole of the vertical axis of one molecule, and the south pole of the vertical of another ; but none between the north of the vertical axis, and the south of a lateral, when the lateral and vertical are unlike axes. This is a natural inference from the general nature of at traction. It also proceeds from the nature of axial attraction, that similar axes by their union form a straight line ; that is, will unite as in f. 224, and not as in f. 226. 224 Paragenic Compound Crystals.\u2014 -The mutual influence of the molecules causes them to assume the parallel position of f. 224, unless some peculiar circumstances operate to prevent it. During the formation of crystals, myriads of which are sometimes pro duced at a single process of crystallization, it must be no uncommon occurrence that two molecules, in close proximity, assuming simul taneously their axes, should have the position given in f. 225. A north and south pole are here adjacent, as in f. 224 ; but the north pole of the other axis in one molecule, has the direction of the south pole in the other molecule. The natural tendency to an in version of one molecule, in order that the uniting axes may be in"], [157, "149 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. the same straight line, is inferior to the attraction exerted between the adjacent north and south poles ; the molecules therefore unite as in f. 226, and constitute, by their union, a nucleus, each half of which acts independently of the other, though in connection with it, and thus produces a compound crystal. To this accident is owing the formation of compound crystals, in which composition is parallel to a face of a rhombic prism. Fig. 227 represents a crystal of Aragonite thus formed, and f. 228, a horizontal section of the same. The planes ii, ii, truncate the acute lateral edges, as may be observed by comparing with f. 225. It is obvious that the axes of the molecules, which are at right angles with those represented in f. 226, (and therefore since they point towards the observer, cannot be represented), may either pre sent their similar poles in the same direction, or by the inversion of one molecule, opposite poles may point in the same direction, as is the case with the parallel axes in the figure. There are therefore the above two methods of forming compound crystals like the above. In the right rhombic prism, however, both these methods produce the same result as regards external form. But in oblique prisms the difference of structure is apparent. We here perceive that those accidents to which molecules gov erned by axial attractions are necessarily liable, actually take place in nature ; and they afford strong presumptive evidence of the truth of the theory proposed to account for them. In the formation of other compound crystals, two molecules unite in points of equilibrium of attraction between two poles, and thus give rise to twins of a second kind ; or in similar points between three poles, producing twins of a third kind. In the first case, the situation of the molecules is that given in f. 230, where they are retained in combination by the action of two north poles of one molecule, on the two south poles of the other. It is obvious that this is an instance of composition parallel to an edge of a prism. In the second case, the combination is due to the action of"], [158, "150 CRYSTALLOGENY. three poles of one molecule on three opposite of the other, and consequently the composition is parallel to a plane on an angle. An example of the second kind of twins is given in f. 357, under Pyroxene, which represents a crystal compounded parallel to the edge ti. Figures of crystals of Feldspar represent other forms resulting by this method : the similar poles of the vertical axes lie in opposite directions. The third kind of twins is exemplified in figures of Calcite, and in other species. Compound crystals composed of more than two individuals, arise from the occurrence of the above species of composition parallel to two or more faces, edges, or angles, simultaneously. Examples of which are represented in figures beyond. Fig. 231 represents a horizontal section of a crystal of Cerusite, four of whose lateral angles equal 117\u00b0 14', the obtuse angle ofthe primary rhombic prism, and two equal 125\u00b0 32', twice the acute 231 232 233 angle of the same. In this instance, composition of the first kind has taken place parallel to two faces of the molecule A. Fig. 232 is a horizontal section of f. 233, (another crystal of the same mineral). Composition has here taken place between A and B, and subsequently, though almost consentaneously, C was added by the attractions between the poles represented in contact. In the preceding prism, (f. 231), the union of B and C with A, was effected at the same instant, but here the addition of C was subse quent to the union of A and B, and from this has arisen the equal inclination of C to the other molecules. In compound crystals thus formed, each face of the prism is a primary plane. The same form may result from the union of A and B merely, without the addition of C, provided the prism A and B have one of their acute lateral edges \u2014 the distant ones \u2014 ; truncated ; for the two upper edges in f. 232 are parallel to the shorter diagonals of A and B, and therefore are also parallel to the truncating plane just referred to. The second figure under the"], [159, "THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 151 species Aragonite is an instance of this mode of formation ; two of the lateral planes of the prism are the planes ii, and four are primary planes, 7\", and the crystal is composed of two individuals, the planes with the letters accented below, belonging to one, and those without the accent, belonging to the other. A horizontal section of f. 234, a crystal of Witherite, is exhibit ed in the outer lines of f. 235. This prism differs from the prece ding in the disposition of its primary angles, which are lettered a, b, c, d. The angles m and n, each equal twice the acute angle. To form the nucleus, A, B, and C, D, were first united,_ and then the compound nuclei AB, CD, were joined by the action of the axes, which are here represented as nearly in contact. Fig. 236 is also based on this mode of structure. In f. a nucleus is in which composi tion has been effected parrallel to all the lateral faces of the molecule A. The truncation of the lateral edges of the four crystals, B, C, D, E, would give rise only to a cruciform crys tal. But the action of the central mole cule A, in conjunction, will cause an addition of particles parallel to A, and thus produce the other two rays. This is a horizontal section of a stellate crys tal of cerusite, (see under that species,) and possibly, also of the similar stellate forms of snow. 23>7 Stellate or hexagonal twins, like those of f. 234 to 237 ap>pear to be impossible in oblique ciystals. There are monoclinic species which are near 120\u00b0 in the vertical prism \u2014 Orthoclase is an ex ample ; but although in trimetric species of the same angle such"], [160, "152 CRYSTALLOGENY. compound forms are very common, they are not known in Ortho clase and species of similar form. From the nature of the aggre gation it is evident that the attraction above and below the middle plane must be perfectly symmetrical, or else such symmetrical aggregations of molecules about a centre could not take place. It is true that three oblique prisms of 120\u00b0 might be placed with their backs together so as to make a triple crystal with a symmetri cal pyramid at one extremity, and a corresponding concavity below. But in the molecules of such prisms, the lateral axes will have the front poles n (or s), and the back poles the reverse ; so that in such an aggregation, all the molecules in the nucleus would be united by poles of the same name, which is an impossibility. If the prisms were joined by the acute angle, the summit would be a cluster of projections. We have sufficient reason, therefore, for concluding that in monoclinic forms such twins are not possible. Moreover, trimetric forms, when hemihedral, as in Datholite, do not become stellately compounded, since they are potentially monoclinic. The second mode of composition, mentioned on page 128, does not come under the explanations thus far presented. This kind of twin cannot occur except under certain conditions. If two mole cules are united by an axis, n to s, an inversion like that referred to would bring n against n, or s against s, and would be impossible. But if two molecules were united by a middle point between an n and an s, then an inversion might take place, and the right half of the compound form might have the plane of section in or out, and constitute a twin in one case of the first mode, and in the other of the second mode. Thus it appears to be, in Feldspar and Albite. An important conclusion hence follows. The lateral crystallo genic axes in these species are not at right angles with one another, like the crystallograpihic ; they intersect at an angle corresponding with the angle of the fundamental prism, or to lines connecting the centres of _ opposite lateral faces. The crystallographic axes are a mathematical convenience simply, and are not necessarily the crys tallogenic ; the latter may intersect at oblique angles as well as right angles, as has been assumed in the preceding pages. The same conclusion follows from the relations of the trimetric species near 90\u00b0 in angle to monometric forms. For very many of them approach the regular octahedron, not in the rhombic octahedron that is formed on the edges ofthe rhombic prism, but in the rectangu lar octahedron formed on the angles of this prism, and consisting of planes ll and li The axial lines connecting the lateral solid angles of such an octahedron are homologous with those of the regular octahedron ; but they cross at an oblique angle, corresponding to the angle of the rhombic prism. Metagenic Compoimd Crystals.\u2014 Metagenic crystals have been described as either \u2014"], [161, "THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 153 1. Doubly geniculated crystals, that is, those which have been apparently bent subsequently to their formation ; or \u2014 2. Those which are composed of two distinct crystals, united by their similar parts. Compound crystals of the former kind result from a reversion of the original polarity in the molecules of the crystal, after the crys tal has attained some size. The causes of this reversion are, pro bably, agents that are not unknown to us. Heat will have this effect on crystals of tourmaline and other minerals, their polarity varying with the temperature. Electricity is equally an efficient agent in producing similar results. Let AB (f. 238) represent a line of molecules in a crystal in the act of formation, with its poles situated as there seen, the marked poles being north. The particle C is supposed to be on the point of obeying its axes of attraction, by uniting the pole n with m. At this moment there is a sudden reversion of the polarity of the crystal, as represented in A'B'. The molecule C now finds a re pellant pole opposing it \u2014 since m and n are both north \u2014 and is immediately drawn around by the attraction between o, the nearest south, and m, and the union exhibited in A\"B\"C takes place, pro- during a geniculation in the crystal. The process, going on simul taneously at the other extremity of the crystal, causes another geniculation of the same. Fig. 239 is a section of a crystal, in which there is seen both a paragenic and metagenic composition. The latter was effected as above described. Geniculation, parallel to a plane on an edge, (or plane li), may be illustrated by means of f. 240 ; AB is again tbe crystal, C the next particle to be added. The molecules are those of a right square prism, which form is peculiarly subject to these accidents. In the figure, these mole cules lie on one of their sides, and only one lateral axis is seen ; the other directing its north pole, s, towards the observer. The union of m and n is again prevented by a reversion of the polarity ; m therefore attracts the nearest north pole, which is s. A revolution of 90\u00b0 must hence take place. But during this time, the unlike poles t and u, (the vertical of the prism), are acting on one another, and tending towards a union ; consequently, the molecule will as- 20"], [162, "154 CRYSTALLOGENY. sume the intermediate position seen in A\"B\"C, in which, contact has taken place at the point of equilibrium between two poles. Fig. 206 represents a crystal of Rutile geniculated, either by this or the next method. A similar composition could not occur in the right rectangular prism ; for s could not be united to m, since they belong to unlike axes, and consequently, there must be a revolution of 180\u00b0, to bring r into union with m. We hence see why the right square prism is particularly subject to this kind of geniculation. An explanation of metagenic geniculation, parallel to an octa hedral plane 1, flows readily from the above. Fig. 316, under Cassiterite, may be an example of this kind of geniculation. The remaining kind of compound crystal is represented in f. 346, of the species Quartz. It is perfectly analogous to the ordinary union of two molecules ; for the crystals are united by their similar faces. They were, probably, brought originally into this parallel situation, by a process analogous to electrical induction, or the mu tual action of their attracting influences. . FORMATION OF SECOND.ARY PLANES, AND ORIGIN OF CLEAVAGE.* It has been abundantly explained that the same substance may crystallize under a variety of forms, all being modifications of one type. A species may occur under the form of a cube, or a cube with truncated edges, or with bevelled edges, or with variously modified angles. If, then, a certain state of the attraction m a molecule will produce the primary cube, some variation from this state is necessary to produce another form, and a different variation for every different secondary form. In view of the fixed simple ratios of mathematical exactness, governing secondary planes, it is obvious that the variations which the attraction undergoes, are in some fl\u0153ed ratio. And as similar parts of crystals are similarly modified, and similar parts are those similarly situated as regards like axes, the homologous parts of molecules experience the variation similarly and simultaneously. The only exceptions to this last principle are the cases of hemi hedrism, in which half the similar parts are modified alike ; and hence it follows that in some cases the parts of a molecule on two opposite sides of a pole may undergo a different amount of va/ria tion of attraction- but this takes place symmetrically, with refer ence to all the poles. In the formation of a cube with truncated edges, the cube is not finished out on the edges. There is, therefore, when secondary planes are formed, a diminution of the force of attraction in the * See an article by the author in the American Journal of Science, [2], iv, 364."], [163, "155 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. line of the primary axes, since these axes fail of completing the primary solid; and this diminution, as above shown, is in some simple ratio. In an enlarging cube, the molecules are added in planes of increasing breadth, as in this way only would the form continue to be a cube. If we consider the case, we find that the central molecule attracts a molecule by each of its poles, and also simultaneously the added molecules act by their lateral axes to complete the plane. We observe in the sectional view (through the centre) in f. 241, when A by its axes unites with four B's, the B's, simultane- ously, while in the act of union, unite with B', B', B', B' ; and thus the square form is retained. This is a sim- ple statement of the process. If now when the B's are uniting, their lateral axes do not act at the same time, then the forming cube will have the edges trun cated as in f. 17. To understand this we must study the steps in the process. Fig. 242 presents the same secondary planes as in f. 17, without the primary faces. It is obvious that in the enlarge ment of such a secondary, when the summit molecule is annexed, its lateral axes do not act as they do when the cube is formed : but when another molecule is added beyond, then they act laterally. This may perhaps be more clearly seen in the transverse section in f. 243. When A attracts B, B does not act laterally as in f. 241 ; it does not so act until B attracts C, when a C is added either side of B. So C acts laterally when a D is added to C, and not before, Again, m.f. 244 we have a section of another figure, (the same secondary as in f. 32), showing the arrangement of molecules in a solid, presenting such a section. Examining it, we perceive that when G is added to the extremity of the central axis, two mole cules, G, G, are added on either side of F, and none laterally to G."], [164, "156 CRYSTAIXOGENY. This figure represents the formation of the secondary plane, hav ino- the ratio 1 : 2, as is evident from inspection, and f. 242 or 243, another with the ratio 1:1. If the period of time occupied by the union of a molecule be represented by p, then when the lateral axes act only after the pe riod of time p, and then add a single row of molecules, the second ary plane is the truncating plane 1:1. For the plane having the ratio 1 : 2, in which two are added laterally to one terminally, or what is equivalent, one laterally for every half one terminally, the time would be \\p ; for the plane 1 : 3, the time would be \\p.

Fig. 245 (the same secondary as in f. 15) will aid the mind in conceiving of it. Here, when the summit particle unites itself, it adds nothing laterally, as was the case also in f. 243 ; when another unites beyond, then four particles are united, one by each lateral pole ; but these four add nothing, until still another particle is added to the summit. In this case there is an interval of time p, between the action of the terminal and lateral axes, and another interval p, between the adding of the four molecules and the action by their lateral axes. And this is the difference between the plane truncating an angle, (f. 15), and another truncating an edge of a cube, (f. 17). This plane trun cating an angle has the ratio 1:1:1. For a plane 1 : 2 : 2, the times will be each \\p, and for any plane 1: m: n, the times will be kp and \\p. It appears that the lateral axes act less speedily therefore for the truncating plane of an angle, than for that of an edge : the centre of the former in a cube is 54\u00b0 44' from the centre of the face ofthe cube, and the centre of the latter from the same is 45\u00b0. We have before observed, that the production of secondary forms depends on the fact, that the force of attraction in the axes of the molecules, when secondaries are produced, is less than that which is exerted when the primary prism or cube is formed. But we cannot suppose the whole force of attraction in a molecule to be different in different circumstances. No facts nor reasoning would sustaia this conclusion. We may admit that the attraction may be more concentrated in the primary axes, in some cases than"], [165, "157 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. in others. It is well known that the polar condition in bodies does not imply an addition of force, but simply an axial action or concentration of the force. This concentration or excited action may be induced by the condition of neighboring bodies or influ ences ; and different bodies should differ widely in their suscepti bility to it, as is evidently the fact. \"Now if the attraction is less concentrated in the primary axes, when a secondary plane forms, the interval of time above alluded to as characterizing the forma tion of different secondaries, will be longer or shorter according to the state of concentration in the primary axes. The more or less diffused state of the attraction is connected with the kind of secondary produced. But when we observe in a complex crystal the evenness of the faces, the neat regularity of the edges, and the perfection through out, even when many secondary planes are combined, it appears clear that such forms could not result from simply a generally dif fused state of the attraction, any more than a primary could be so produced. In each case there must be as many distinct poles as there are planes. When therefore the principal axes lose their concentration, this loss consists in a distribution of the force into subordinate axes intermediate between the primary axes. For a truncation of the edges of a cube, the intermediate axes would have their poles just at the middle point between every two poles of the primary axes ; for a truncation of the angles, the poles would be at the middle point between every three poles. We have remarked on the symmetrical arrangement of secondary planes in general, and this would follow from the necessary symmetrical ar rangement of such axes. Moreover, the length of time p, will be greater the farther the secondary pole is situated from the primary poles. And this is true in fact. The pole for the octahedron is the most distant, being at the central point between three primary poles. The number of combined secondary forms may still seem mysterious. But a crystal, in its capacity as a unit, would neces sarily have a corresponding character in its different parts to that ofthe molecules of which it consists, and consequently the attrac tion exerted by the molecules in these different parts would corres pond, occasioning thus the secondary planes. The relative extent of the several different kinds of planes will depend primarily on the relative force of action in the different sets of axes. These considerations lead us to conclude, that the diminution of attracting force in the primary axes, on which the formation of a secondary depends, consists in the partial action of this force along intermediate axes, symmetrically situated with reference to the primary axes ; and the greater or less amount of diminution, determines the kind of distribution* * In the case of substances that very seldom crystallize or never, we have evi dence that the polar forces are weak."], [166, "158 CRYSTALLOGENY. The relation of the planes in Humite (see page 59, and this species beyond) have an important bearing on this subject. The planes, or the numbers expressing their axial proportions, are parts of infinite series, which are different in the three crystals. Such mathematical series point out definitely a mutual dependence in the planes of each form ; they suggest that the modifications of the attraction upon which they depend, are connected with the different conditions of the attraction that may be represented by curves to which such infinite series lead. The same crystalline form may have different cleavage. For example, cubes of Galena have a cubical cleavage, while cubes of fluor spar have an octahedral cleavage, or yield octahedrons when cleaved. These different circumstances would result, provided that in one case (for Galena) the three primary axes of the molecule were dominant, and in the other, the eight intermediate or octa hedral axes. The arrangement of the molecules in each case would depend on the dominant axes, and so also would the direc tion of the cleavage. Hence, the direction of cleavaye may some times indicate in any species of matter which set of axes is dom inant, the primary or a secondary set. In the preceding paragraphs, after explaining the general polar action of crystallogenic or cohesive attraction, we have pointed out the modifications of condition this attraction undergoes, the simple ratios presented by these modifications, and their dependence on the formation of intermediate axes. Cohesive attraction, instead of being a constant force, as might be inferred from the ordinary definitions, appears therefore to be complex in its actions, yet sim ple in the general laws by which this complexity is produced. Owing to some intrinsic or extrinsic influence, (the presence and condition of matter near by or commingled with the crystal lizing material), the primary axes may be sustained in an excited state. But if there is nothing to sustain or excite this concentra tion, and the action is quiet, or if bodies around induce it, owing to their own condition, the attraction becomes more diffused, and se condary axes multiply. All the crystals of a locality or region have usually the same form. The constancy of certain forms in some species is evidence of the peculiar susceptibilities of the molecules of these substances. Thus the calc spar in the limestone of Lockport has the dog-tooth shape, the scalene dodecahedron ; that of Boonville, E\". Y., occurs in short six-sided prisms. That of the Rossie lead region in com plex combinations of different secondary planes with the primary. These facts indicate, that the variations of attraction, pi-oducing secondary forms, depend often on surrounding bodies favoring the concentration or diffusion of the attracting force ; and the causes often act in nature simultaneously over wide areas. Cleavage, \u2014 The pecubarities of cleavage give us information on"], [167, "159 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY another point, respecting cohesive or crystallogenic attraction. The facility of cleavage in prisms differs in the direction of unlike axes. Topaz cleaves easily parallel to the base of the prism, and hardly at all in other directions. This difference does not depend upon the relative strength of attraction in the unequal axes ; for it is often the reverse of this. Again, while some of the hardest substances have perfect cleavage, other soft species have none. If then this quality has no relation to the strength of the at traction which unites molecule to molecule, it must depend on some peculiarity in the manner in which tbis force acts. This force may act in two ways ; \u2014 either continuously or intermittedly ; and the latter mode only, could produce the result in view. The action of force in nature appears to be generally intermittent. Al ternate action and comparative inaction, with corresponding results, are everywhere exemplified in organic growth ; and it is therefore no anomaly that it should be exemplified in the inorganic kingdom.* When, therefore, cleavage is produced in crystallization, the union of layers of molecules takes place by an intermitted action ; that is, with regular successive variations or pulses in the intensity of the force of attraction. This intermitted action, when reduced to the adding simply of single layers in succession, becomes con tinuous. On these principles there might be every variety of this quality in nature, and there should be no necessary connection between cleavage and strength of attraction. We therefore infer that the action of cohesive attraction is often intermittent, pro ducing seriate results, (as exemplified in the cleavage of crystals), and the specific rate of intermittent action is different for unequal axes.f * The successive layers in wood, the periodical reproduction of leaves or flowers, and of young in animals, and the seriate arrangement of parts in many plants and animals, all illustrate intermittent growth. In some zoophytes the buds form in successive series of two, four, or six, or some other fixed number ; in other cases opposite 6ides alternate in budding, or when there are several rows, the rows bud in succession ; and these are examples of intermittent action. The spiral arrangement of leaves in vegetation, is another illustration of inter mittent growth ; for here the different sides of the growing plant bud successively, for the simple reason, of universal application, that reproduction produces tem porary exhaustion, or, that force is exerted intermittedly. The pulsation of molecular force is also an example of intermitted action, and must lie at the basis of the universal principle on this subject to which we have alluded. The reality of this pulsation we cannot doubt. The undulatory theory of light must be received as fully demonstrated ; and if it is an ether that pulsates, it is molecular force which makes it pulsate, and this implies pulsating action in molecular force itself. The attraction of cohesion is shown by cleavage to be intermittent in intensity ; we do not learn from it that there is any actual intermission of time in the exertion of the force, or a variation in rate of pulsation. f Many crystals, as remarked on page 110, have parallel striations, which consist of alternations of two or more sets of planes. Thus cubes of pyrites very generally have their faces marked with stri\u00e6 which are oscillations between a plane replacing the edge, and either a face of the primary cube, or another plane of the same"], [168, "160 CRYSTALLOGENY. In aggregated crystallizations, there is a mass of material entering the solid state together, and no opportunity exists for sin- gle crystals to perfect themselves. While a liquid mass is cooling, whenever the temperature of solidification is reached, at numb* less points throughout the mass, crystallization will begin : and together, an aggregation of crowded crystals or grains is produced, with no external regularity of form ; in other words, the granular structure. The same will \"happen in a crystallizing solution, if the process goes on rapidly. When a solution is spread thinly over a large surface, minute crystalline points incrust the whole ; and if the solution be gradu- ally supplied as crystallization goes on, it is obvious that the minute points may elongate into crowded prisms or fibres, producing a fibrous structure. Such a structure is common in narrow seams in rocks, and the fibres are usually elongated across the seam. The concentric structure is another result depending on the rate of solidification connected often with the rate of chemical com- bination. In the first place, the nucleus is always a cluster of molecules, instead of a single one, as in a simple crystal. The structure sometimes commences around some foreign body as a centre, though the aggregation is often without any proper nucleus except that of the cluster of molecules that first solidified. The second principle, on which the concentric structure depends, is the tendency of a body to communicate its own condition to other bodies within its influence. This law \u2014 the law of equilibrium, and contact or catalysis in chemistry \u2014 is one of the universal laws of existence. According to it, eitner a collection of molecules enter- ing the solid state, or any foreign body already solid, will tend to bring adjacent bodies into the same or an intermediate condition. If susceptible to this influence, the particles adjoining become as- similated, and unite to the nucleus ; these again act upon others adjoining, and thus a spherical form is produced, as a result of successive development.* The influence of foreign substances associated with a crystalliz- ing mineral is known to cause, not only secondary planes, but also considerable variations in the angles of crystals, even when they are chemically inert. This has been attributed to an intervention simply of the foreign particles among the others. But M. Nickles secondary. Some octahedrons of fluor spar have faces which consist of minute cubes. These facts, and they are common and well known, show a frequent intermittent mode of action in the different axes of molecules, (or a seeming strife between dif ferent sets) ; and such examples are well called an \" oscilLatory combination\" of planes. Crystals of snow often well illustrate intermittent action. _ * The concentric structure here explained is analogous in many respects to the circular and spherical forms in vegetation. The growing lichen extends itself cir cularly, owing to progressive assimilation or development. This proves no simi larity of nature between the organic forces and cohesive attraction ; it only shows that different forces act under a common law."], [169, "161 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. regards it as due to a change in the axial molecular attractions of the crystallizing material, and by way of illustration he alludes to the influence upon a planetary system from the sudden appearance in it of a new body: the attractions of the foreign particles modify more or less the molecules of the associated material. This chemist states that bimalate of ammonia was thus changed a de1 gree or more in angle in his experiments.* It has long been known that a change in refraction or polarization is produced by this cause : but Senarmont has quite recently rendered certain salts (as nitrate of strontian) pleochroic by the same process \u2014 that is, by the introduction of foreign substances through crystallization, which were afterwards removed by recrystallizations in pure water. f We have thus reviewed some of the various facts presented by matter, as it exists around us. Observation has proved more prof itable than closet speculation in animal and vegetable Physiology ; and thus it will be with regard to the organizing force of the so called inorganic kingdom. The fact that the attraction of molecules is liable to modifications of condition, and especially the simple yet fixed relations between these modifications, nothing but a crystal could make known to us. Yet the principle is as wide as the uni verse in its application*; for we*live in a universe of molecules, and all the grandeur of physical nature is the result of molecular forces. From the late rapid progress in science, we may be encouraged to hope that ere long this entrance to one of the innermost recesses of the works of nature will be thrown open, and that the qualities of atoms or molecules, their forms and peculiarities, will soon be fully understood. Its connection with the science of chemistry, and other physical sciences, renders it deserving of very minute experimental research. Beautifully and truly was it long since observed by Gulielmini, in his work on Crystallization \u2014 an author who, though afterwards forgotton, had a clearer insight into the nature of crystallization, than any of his contemporaries, and many of his successors \u2014 p. 144 : \" Crystallizatio geometrizantis natur\u00e6 opus quoddam est, et sane mirabilissimum ; dignum ideo ut totis ingenii viribus totaque mentis contentione exquiratur, non quod spectet tantam am\u0153nitatem et voluptatem, qu\u00e6 mirabilium scientiam consequitur, verum etiam ob maximam in re physica utilitatem ; videtur quippe Natura hie se prodere, et omni exuta velamine non qualis esse potest, sed qualis actu est sese pr\u00e6bere conspiciendam.\" * Compt.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. I. CHARACTERS DEPENDING ON LIGHT. Light may(be either reflected, transmitted, or emitted. The qual ities of minerals thus produced are of six kinds : \u2014 1. Lustre; depending on the power and manner of reflecting light. 2. Color ; depending on the kind of light reflected or trans mitted. 3. Diaphaneity ; depending on the power of transmitting light. 4. Refraction ; depending on the manner of transmitting light. 5. Polarization ; depending on the manner of transmitting or reflecting light, and due to the polar nature of force. 6. Phosphorescence ; depending on the power of emitting light. I. LUSTRE, The lustre of minerals varies with the nature of their surfaces. A variation in the quantity of light reflected, produces different degrees of intensity of lustre; a variation in the nature of the re flecting surface, produces different kinds of lustre. a. The kinds of lustre recognized are six. 1. Metallic : the lustre of metals. Imperfect metallic lustre is expressed by the term sub-metallic. 2. Vitreous : the lustre of broken glass. An imperfectly vitre ous lustre is termed sub^vitreous. The vitreous and sub- vitreous lustres are the most common in the mineral kingdom. Quartz possesses the former in an eminent degree ; calcareous spar, often the latter. This lustre, in each case, approaches the lustre of bro ken glass of the color of the mineral. 3. Resinous : lustre of the yellow resins. Ex. Opal, and some yellow varieties of Blende. 4. Pearly: like pearl. Ex. Talc, Brucite, Stilbite, &c. When united with sub-metalbc, as in Hypersthene, the term metallic pearly is used. 5. Silky :_ like silk ; it is the result of a fibrous structure. Ex. fibrous Calcite, fibrous Gypsum."], [171, "COLOR. 163 6. Adamantine : the lustre of the diamond. When also sub metallic, it is termed metallic-adamantine. Ex. Cerusite, Pyrargy rite. b. The degrees of intensity are denominated as follows : \u2014 1. Splendent: reflecting with brilliancy, and giving well defined images. Ex. Specular Iron, Cassiterite. 2. Shining : producing an image by reflection, but not one well defined. Ex. Celestine. 3. Glistening : affording a general reflection from the surface, but no image. Ex. Talc, Copper Pyrites. 4. Glimmering : affording imperfect reflection, and apparently from points over the surface. Ex. Flint, Chalcedony. A mineral is said to be dull when there is a total absence of lus tre. Ex. Chalk, the Ochres, Kaolin. These different degrees and kinds of lustre are often exhibited differently by unlike faces ofthe same crystal, but always similarly by like faces. The lateral faces of a right square prism may thus differ from a terminal, and in the right rectangular prism the lateral faces also may differ from one another. The surface of a cleavage plane in foliated minerals, very commonly differs in lustre from the sides, and in some cases the latter are vitreous, while the former is pearly. As shown by Haidinger, only the vitreous, adamantime and metallic lustres belong to faces perfectly smooth and pure. In the first, the index of refraction of the mineral is 1*3 \u2014 1*8 ; in the second, 1*9 \u2014 2-5 ; in the third, about 2-5. The pearly lustre is a result of reflection from numberless lamell\u00e6 or lines within a translucent mineral, as long since observed by Breithaupt. n. COLOR. The external color of minerals often differs from the color of the powder, or that of a scratched surface. The latter, called the Streak, is the most constant character, since it seldom varies in the same species. The mineral species are liable to so many accidental mixtures of foreign substances, that, in general, little reliance can be placed on the external color. The metals and the metallic oxyds are among those species which are least subject to variation. The following eight colors have been selected as fundamental, to facilitate the employment of this character in the description of minerals : White, Gray, Rlack, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, and Brown. a.

Play of Colors. \u2014 An apptearance of several prismatic colors in rapid succession on turning the mineral. This property belongs in perfection to the diamond ; it is also observed in precious opal, and is most brilliant by candle light. Change of Colors. \u2014 'Each particular color appears to pervade a larger space than in the play of colors, and the succession produced by turning the mineral is less rapid ; Ex. Labradorite. Opjalescence. \u2014 A milky or pearly reflection from the interior of a specimen. Observed in some Opal, and in Cat's eye. Iridescence. \u2014 Presenting prismatic colors in the interior of a crystal. Tarnish. \u2014 A metallic surface is tarnished, when its color differs from that obtained by fracture ; Ex. Erubescite. A surface pos sesses the steel tarnish, when it presents the superficial blue color of tempered steel ; Ex. Columbite. The tarnish is irised, when it exhibits fixed prismatic colors ; Ex. specular iron of Elba. The tarnish and iris colors of minerals are owing to a thin sur-"], [174, "166 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. face film, proceeding from different sources, either from a change in the surface of the mineral, or foreign incrustation. Hausmann states that hydrated oxyd of iron (usually formed from pyrites) is one of the most common sources of it, and produces the colors on anthracite and specular iron. Arsenic becomes irised through the action of hydrogen from the atmosj)here : arsenical cobalt, nickel, and iron, by oxydation : galena probably, from the formation of sulphate of lead at the surface : magnetic iron and some ferrugin ous silicates from a change in the oxyd of iron to a hydrate : pyrites, and probably also copper pyrites and variegated pyrites, from the formation of a hydrate of iron : antimony glance and other anti mony ores from the formation of antimony ochre ; Gray Copper and other arsenical ores probably from the oxydation of the arsenic. The irised colors may also proceed from a disengagement of car bonic acid or water, as in Spathic iron and Diallogite. Heat some times favors it, as in the case of steel. Dichroism, Pleochroism. \u2014 Some crystals, viewed by transmit ted light, \"present different colors in different directions. This prop erty is termed pleochroism, (from the Greek irXsos, full, and xpoa, color), or dichroism, (from <W, two-fold, and xPoa); when the colors are different in two directions only. This property is exhibited by crystals which have at least two kinds of axes ; the colors are the same in the direction of like axes, and different in the direction of unlike axes. Iobte owes its name (dichroite) to this property. Mica is nearly opaque in one direction, while it is transparent and of a different color in another. Monometric crystals are sometimes pleochroic, the color differing in the direc tion of unlike diagonals. An instrument called a dichroscope has been contrived by Haidinger for examining this pe culiarity of crystals. An oblong rhombohedron of Iceland spar has cemented to each extrem ity a glass prism of 18\u00b0. It is placed in a metallic cylindrical case, as in the figure,'hav ing a convex lens at one end, and a square hole at the other. On looking through it, the square hole appears double ; and when a pleochroic crystal is examined with it, by transmitted light, on revolving it, the two angles, at inter- vals in the revolution, have different colors, the colors being those which the transmitted light affords. Andalusite, Tourmaline, Corundum, Topaz, Idocrase, Euclase, Mica, show well the property, and any colored crystals not monometric that are sufficiently trans parent. Dichroism is thus detected by looking in but one direc tion, and the two colors are brought into direct contrast, and made thereby obvious when not otherwise perceived."], [175, "167 REFRACTION. III. DIAPHANEITY. The diaphaneity of a mineral is its capacity of transmitting light. The following terms are adopted to express the different degrees of this property. Transparent : when the outline of an object seen through the mineral is perfectly distinct. Gypsum, Quartz. Subtransparent, or semi-transparent : when objects are seen, but outlines are not distinct. Translucent: when light is transmitted, but objects are not seen. Carrara marble. Subtranslucent : when merely the edges transmit light, or are translucent. When no light is transmitted, the mineral is said to be opaque. This property occurs in the mineral kingdom, in every degree from a perfect opacity to a perfect transparency, and most minerals present, in their numerous varieties, nearly all the different shades. Few minerals, except the metals, are perfectly opaque. It is always similar in the direction of like axes of a crystal, and often dissim ilar in the direction of unlike axes. TV. REFRACTION, POLARIZATION. A full account of the refraction and polarization of light belongs more especially to a treatise on optics, where the student will find the subject discussed at length. The remarks in this place are necessarily confined to a few simple explanations. a. Simple Refraction. \u2014 If we look into a cup obliqely, at such an angle that an object at its bottom is just concealed from view by its sides, on filling the cup with water, this object will become visible. This is owing to a bending or refracting of the rays of light, by the water. This effect is termed refraction, and is pro duced by all transparent bodies, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. The part of the ray AED, within the 248 water, is nearer the perpendicular BC, than if it had proceeded in its original direction AE ; or, if we consider the ray as passing from the water into the air, the part AE, is farther from the same perpendicular than if it had proceeded in the original direction DE. We have therefore this important principle: Light, in passing from a rarer ~c tT\\ to a denser medium, is refracted towards the perpendicular ; if from a denser to a rarer, it is refracted from the perpendicular. It has been proved by experiment, that at whatever angle we look at the surface of the water, there will be a constant ratio between AB and CD, provided the eye and the object are at the"], [176, "168 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. same distance, A and D, from E. That is, if AB is twice the length of CD, viewing it at one angle, it will be twice at every other angle, until the eye is perpendicular over the object D, when there is no refraction. But AB is the sine of the angle AEB, which is the angle of incidence, and CD is the sine of the angle CED, which is the angle of refraction. This principle may there fore be thus stated : The sine of the angle of incidence beans a constant ratio to the sine of the angle of refraction. This ratio is termed the index of refraction. In water, the ratio is as 1-335 to 1. 1-335 is therefore the index of refraction of water. The following are the indices of refraction for the substances enumerated : Tabasheer, 1-211 Witherite, 1-700 Ice, 1-308 Boracite, 1-701 Water, 1-335 Chrysoberyl, 1-760 Cryolite, 1-349 Feldspar (Adularia), 1-764 Fluor Spar, 1-436 Corundum \u2014 white, 1-768 Alum, 1-457 \" red, 1-779 Borax, 1-475 \" blue, 1-794 Gypsum, 1-525 Garnet, 1-815 Chalcedony, 1-553 Zircon, 1-961 Rock Salt, 1-557 Cerusite, 2-084 Quartz, 1-548 Sulphur, 2-115 Euclase, 1-642 Blende, 2-260 Calcite 1-654 Diamond, 2-439\u20142-755 Aragonite, 1-693 Crocoisite, 2-500\u20142-974 There is some variation often in the same species, and it fre quently corresponds to a change of color. Double Refraction. \u2014 Many crystalline substances give two im ages instead of one, owing to double refraction. If a line be viewed through a transparent crystal of calc spar, it will appear double in every direction but one \u2014 that of the vertical axis of the rhom bohedron. One image is seen by the ordinary refraction of light ; the other, by an extraordinary refraction. If the same crystal is placed over a point, and turned around, one image will appear to revolve around the other. The direction in which there is no re fraction is called the axis of double refraction, or neutral line, since in its direction the ordinary and extraordinary rays coincide. Double refraction increases in passing from this direction to one at right angles with it. In some instances the extraordinary ray is situated between the ordinary ray and a perpendicular to the surface of the crystal; and in others it is exterior to this ray. The former possess a greater index of refraction for the extraordinary than for the ordi nary ray, and the axis is called a positive axis of double refraction. In the latter, the reverse is the case, and the axis is a negative axis. Calcite has a negative axis, quartz, a positive. The following are the indices for a few substances :"], [177, "169 POLARIZATION. Ordinary ray. Extraordinary ray. Calcite (neg.) 1*654 1*483 Aragonite (neg.) 1*693 1*535 Quartz (pos.) 1*548 1*558 Euelase (pos.) 1*643 1*663 Topaz (pos.) 1*632 1*640 Zircon, tin ore, rutile, apophyllite, gothite, brucite, tungsten, and ice are examples of a positive axis ; and idocrase, scapolite, meio nite, tourmaline, corundum, emerald, apatite, nepheline, dioptase, alum, pyromorphite, arsenate and molybdate of lead, cinnabar, anatase, of a negative axis. When there are two axes of double refraction, both rays, as shown by Fresnel, are due to extraordinary refraction. The two axes are in a vertical plane in right prisms, but not necessarily so in oblique prisms. The apparent angle between these axes has been determined for many minerals, and has served to distinguish species. The following are some examples : Cerusite, _ 5\u00b0 15' Celestine, 50\u00b0 Strontianite, 6\u00b0 56' Comptonite, 56\u00b0 6' Mica\u2014 different kinds, 1\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 50', Topaz (Scotland), 56\u00b0 60\u00b0 to 78\u00b0 Gypsum, 60\u00b0 Talc, 7\u00b0 24' Iolite, 62\u00b0 50' Aragonite, 18\u00b0 19' Adularia, 63\u00b0 Chrysoberyl, 27\u00b0 51' Topaz (Aberdeenshire), 65\u00b0 Anhydrite, 28\u00b0 7' Axinite, 73\u00b0 Epsomite, 37\u00b0 24' Kyanite, 81\u00b0 48' Barytes, 37\u00b0 42' Epidote, 84\u00b0 19' Stilbite, 41\u00b0 42' Andalusite, 87\u00b0 33' Zinc Vitriol, 49\u00b0 42' Chrysolite, 87\u00b0 56' Topaz (Brazilian), 49 \u2014 50\u00b0 Copperas, 90\u00b0 Monometric solids which have the three axes equal to one an- other have no double refraction. But all other forms exhibit this property; and if the horizontal diameters are equal, as in the dimetric and hexagonal systems, there is but one cuxis ; if unequal, two axes, as in the trimetric and oblique systems. Polarization. \u2014 The polarization of light is intimately connected with double refraction, this polarity being exhibited by the extra- ordinary ray, which is said to be a polarized ray. When such a ray is viewed by means of another doubly refracting crystal or crystalline plate, (called from this use of it, an analyzing plate), the ray of light becomes alternately visible and invisible, as the latter plate is revolved. If the polarized light be made to pass through a doubly refracting crystal, then on viewing it in the man- ner stated, rings of prismatic colors are developed, and on revolv- ing the analyzing plate, the colored rings and intervening dark rings gradually change places. If crystalline plates having one axis of double refraction be viewed in the direction of the axis, the rings are circles, and they are crossed by a dark or light cross. 22"], [178, "170 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. Fig. 249 shows the position of the colored rings and cross in calc spar, and f. 250 the same at intervals of 90\u00b0 in the revolution of the plate. With a crystal having two axes of double refraction, Calcite. Nitre. there are two series of elliptical rings, as in f. 251 and 252, the latter alternating with the former in the revolution of the plate. Light is polarized also by other means. If a ray of light be reflected from a plate of glass at a certain angle it is polarized ; and so each reflecting substance has its own angle for polarizing light. In glass the angle between the ray and a perpendicular to the glass, is 56\u00b0 45', or between the ray and the glass, 35\u00b0 15', but varying somewhat for the kind of glass. In fluor spar the latter angle is 34\u00b0 51', in quartz 33\u00b0 2', calc spar 31\u00b0 9', diamond 21\u00b0 59'. Again, if light be made to pass through a series of thin transparent plates of glass or mineral substance it is polarized, the angle of polarization differing as the number of plates is varied. The angle of polarization or double refraction, varies widely in the same species, it varying with small differences of composition or the presence of impurities, and also the condition of crystals. Senarmont even refers all the micas to a single form, notwith standing the wide difference in the angles. In common mica (species museovite) the angle is acknowledged to vary between 45\u00b0 and 78\u00b0. Phlogopite ranges in the angle between 3\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. Plates of transparent tourmaline, cut parallel to the vertical axis, are conveniently used both for the polarizer and analyzer ; and it is necessary only to put the mineral between two such tourmaline plates and look through, revolving one of them, to see the rings and their changes. In mica they are well shown ; but it is often necessary to look very obliquely to distinguish both of the poles in the biaxial micas, and the plate of mica must not be too thin. _ As the light from certain parts of the sky in a clear day is polarized, a single tourmaline is often sufficient to show the rings to the observer looking towards the sky. The angle between the two poles is easily measured, when the crystals are not too minute, or the angle not too large. A con venient method, of sufficient accuracy for the mineralogist, is to"], [179, "171 PHOSPHORESCENCE. take a graduated horizontal circle, having an arm moving over it, attached at the centre. Tire mica being put between the polarizer and analyzer, place it vertically (by means of some contrivance for the purpose) upon the movable arm, precisely at the centre of the circle. Look through until the middle of the system of rings is seen in the direction of a cord stretched vertically across a win dow ; then move the arm until the centre of the other system of rings is seen in the same direction ; the angle over which the arm has passed, will be read off on the graduated circle. By a very simple arrangement, easily inferred from the above, a common Wollaston's goniometer may be employed. A contrivance for this purpose has been planned by Mr. W. P. Blake, and an instrument of the kind has been recently constructed which gives very accurate results, by Soleil of Paris. It is adapted with a small telescope for observing very small plates. Other instruments have been devised expressly for this purpose, hut it is not neces sary to speak of them in this place. Polarization has the same relation to crystalline form as double refraction. Some monometric crystals give the rings of colors due to polarization ; but the rings have a symmetrical arrange ment like the faces of the crystals, and have been shown by Biot to be due not to the molecular character of the crystal, hut to its cleavage or lamellar structure, the lamell\u00e6 polarizing as a series of thin plates, in the manner just mentioned. A peculiar polari zing structure in apophyllite, not according with the general law for dimetric crystals, is explained by him in this manner. Com pression will give a doubly-refracting crystal to many monometric crystals. Besides ordinary or plane polarization, there is also what is called circular polarization. Quartz crystals have been described as sometimes right-handed and sometimes left-handed in their modifications. The circles of colors, when plates of crystals cut transverse to the axis are examined, have a spiral character, and on revolving the analyzer, the spiral is found to turn to the right in right-handed crystals, and to the left in left-handed. V. PHOSPHORESCENCE. Phosphorescence, or the emission of light by minerals, may be produced in different ways ; by friction, by heat, or by exposure to light. By friction. Light is readily evolved from quartz or white sugar, by the friction of one piece against another, and merely the rapid motion of a feather will elicit it from some specimens of \u00a3ul phuret of zinc. Friction, however, evolves light from1 a few only of the mineral species. By heat. Fluor spar is highly phosphorescent at the temperature"], [180, "172 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. of 300\u00b0 F. Different varieties give off light of different colors ; the chlorophane variety, an emerald green light ; others purple, blue, and reddish tints. This phosphorescence may be observed in a dark place, by subjecting the pulverized mineral to a heat below redness. Some varieties of white limestone or marble emit a yel low light. By the application of heat, minerals lose their phosphorescent properties. But on passing electricity through the calcined mine ral, a more or less vivid light is produced at the time of the dis charge, and subsequently the specimen when heated will often emit light as before. The light is usually of the same color as previous to calcination, but occasionally is quite different. The light induced by electricity is in general less intense than that of the unaltered mineral, hut ia much increased by a repetition of the electric discharges, and in some varieties of fluor it may be nearly or quite restored to its former brilliancy. It has also been found that some varieties of fluor, and some specimens of diamond, calc spar, and apatite, which are not naturally phos phorescent, may be rendered so by means of electricity. A dozen discharges through a non-phosphorescing statuary marble in pow der, caused it to emit a yellow light when subsequently heated. Electricity will also increase the natural intensity of the phosphor escent light. Acquired phosphorescence is not, however, equally permanent with the natural. On 21 days of exposure to the light, according to Mr. Pearsall, many specimens lost partially, and some entirely, this property ; in others, the color of the light was changed ; and generally to purple and orange tints. If laid away in a dark room, they retained this property for a much longer period of time. Mr. Pearsall states that some colored fluors that had been rendered white by calcination, received a bluish or reddish tint, by means of repeated electrical discharges.* Light of the sun. The only substance in which an exposure to the light of the sun produces very apparent phosphorescence, is the diamond, and some specimens seem to be destitute of this power. This property is most striking after exposure to the blue rays of the spectrum, while in the red rays it rapidly loses its phosphorescence. * Jour. Boy. Institution, i, 77, 267."], [181, "173 ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM. H. ELECTRICITY\u2014 MAGNETISM. The electric and magnetic characters of crystals hear hut slightly upon the Science of Mineralogy, although of high interest to the student of physics. Frictional Electricity. \u2014 The development of electricity by friction, is a familiar fact. There is no line of distinction among minerals, dividing them into positively electric and negatively electric ; for both kinds of electricity may be presented by differ ent varieties of the same species, and by the same variety in dif ferent states. The gems are positively electric only when polished ; the diamond alone among them exhibits positive electricity, whether polished or not. The time of retaining electric excite ment is widely different in different, species, and topaz is remark able for continuing excited many hours. Pyro-electricity. \u2014 On heating crystals of some minerals, they become electric with opposite polarity in opposite parts. This property is called pyro-electricity. Tourmaline, calamine, and boracite, are among the species thus affected. They are peculiar in having the opposite parts dissimilarly modified, and in these opposite parts are the opposite poles. The polarity continues as long as the temperature is increasing, and becomes reversed when it commences to decline ; and when the heat is stationary it disap pears. This subject has been investigated by the Abbe Haiiy, Canton, Becquerel, Brewster, Erman, Kohler, Hankel, Riess, and Eose. Rose and Riess* name one of the poles the analogue electric pole, and the other the antilogue electric pole. The former becomes positive while the crystal is heating and negative while cooling ; and the latter the reverse, being negative while heating and posi tive while cooling. Becquerel says of the tourmaline : f \" At 30\u00b0 C, electrical polarity was sensible ; it continued unchanged to 150\u00b0, as long as the temperature continued to rise ; if stationary an in stant, the polarity disappeared, but shortly manifested itself re versed, when the temperature commenced to decline. If but one end of the crystal was heated, the crystal was unpolarized, and when two sides were unequally heated, each acquired an electrical state independent of the other \" In tourmaline, the extremities of the prism are dissimilarly modified, and that end which presents * .Uber die Byro-electricitat der Mineralien, von P.

In f. 456, under tourmaline, the upper extremity is the antilogue pole, (positive under increasing heat), and the other is the analogue pole. The pyramid of the analogue end is more flattened by its facets than that of the anti logue end. 253 254 Analogue Pole. Antilogue Pole. The figures here given represent the extremities of a crystal from Gouverneur, ~N. T., as drawn by Rose. On the antilogue end we find the rhombohedral faces, 4r, Sr', while on the other the longest rhombohedron is 2r', thus conforming to the statement just made. Pyro-electric polarity has been observed in the following sub stances ; the names of those who first observed it, are annexed. Tourmaline, Lemery. Prehnite, Haiiy. Topaz, Canton. Electric Calamine, Haiiy. Axinite, Brard. Sphene, Haiiy. Boracite, Haiiy. Rhodizite, Rose. Scolecite, Haiiy. Heavy Spar, Brewster. Rock Crystal, Brewster. Riess and Rose have confirmed the observations with regard to the above mineral species. Brewster has added Calcite, yellow Beryl, Celestine, Cerusite, red cmd blue Fluor span; Diamond, Orpiment, Analcime, Amethyst, Idocrase, MeUitef, Sulphw, Garnet, and Iolite. But the more recent investigations of Riess and Rose have failed to detect this property in any but the species first enumerated. Pyro-electricity is of two kinds :* \u2014 either terminally polar, or centrally polar. In the former, the extremities are opposite poles. In the latter, two sides of a prism are of the same name, and the opposite pole to each is intermediate between the two. * Biess and Bose."], [183, "ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM. 175 The examples of the first kind are Tourmaline, Calamine, and Scolecite, xmiaxial; Axinite, biaxial; Boracite and Rhodizite, with four axes. Calamine, like tourmaline, has the sharper extremity the anti logue end, and the more flattened the analogue. Compound crystals from Altenberg haAre both ends analogue, and the middle, between the twins, antilogue electric. As in tourmaline, the pyro-electric axis corresponds with the vertical axis of the prism. Boracite, which crystallizes in cubes with the opposite solid angles differently modified, has four pyro-electric axes, correspond ing to the four octahedral axes. In f. 53 of this species, the plane 1 is the antilogue pole, and the unmodified angle the analogue pole ; and, generally, the antilogue pole is most largely modified by secondary planes, or has larger facets. Phodizite resembles boracite in its pyro-electricity. The species in which pyro-electricity of the second kind has been observed, are prehnite and topaz. If f. 255 represent a tabular crystal of prehnite, the poles will be situated as marked, the analogue being central, and the antilogue at either extremity of the shorter diagonal of the rhombic prism. Topaz has in a similar manner a central analogue pole and an anti logue at either extremity of the shorter diagonal. In some instances there is a separate set of similar poles near one or the other angle, as in the following figure ; \u00b11 \u25a0 1 \u25a0 1. _. !_\u25a0____ J\u00bb____ __T_ _ mis nas arisen probably trom tne com pound nature of the crystal. The particular character of the axes in Sphene, Barytes, and rock crystal has not been made out. Two specimens \"of Barytes were heated to 180\u00b0 R, and positive electricity was observed, but not negative, and it was hence inferred that the pyro-electricity was centrally polar, as in topaz. Quartz was found to be pyro-electric in a single small crystal six lines long and two thick, after failing in six others, five of which were an inch in length and one half an inch thick. Great caution is required in the trial with this mineral, as the crystals are so readily rendered electric by friction. , Magnetism. \u2014 Substances have been divided into magnetic and diamagnetic. The magnetic take a longitudinal position between the poles of a strong magnet, the diamagnetic a transverse position. In the former division are iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, cerium, osmium; among the latter, bismuth, antimony, tin, mercury, gold, arsenic, zinc, lead. Magnetism is most strongly exhibited by iron and its compounds."], [184, "176 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MtNEEaiLS. and specimens of magnetic iron often have, polarity. Rmenite and specular iron ore are also at times magnetipolar. The or dinary mode of testing whether a mineral is magnetic or not, is to bring it near a pole of a delicately suspended magnetic needle, and observe whether it causes it to vibrate ; and another mode is to apply a strong magnet to the mineral in powder. These are suf ficient for the mineralogist, without all the delicacy required for the purposes of physical science. Delessse has experimented ex tensively upon the magnetic force of minerals, and has determined the relative amount for numerous species. Calling this force for Styrian steel 100-000, the following are some of his results :\u2014 Native platinum, 2-173\u20143*047 Magnetic iron ore, .

Labradorite of an antique green pophyry, 0*077 Hornblende, 0*012\u20140*057 Crystcdlo-magnetic action. \u2014 The magnetic polarity thus far alluded to, belongs to the mass, and has no relation to crystalline form. There is also a kind of polarity directly related to the crys talline or optical axes of minerals, as has been recently developed by Faraday and Plucker. Pliicker observes that a crystal of kya nite, suspended horizontally, points very well to the north, by the magnetic power of the earth only, and is a true compass needle, from which even the declination may be obtained ; and the line of direction is the line of the optical axes. Other crystals, which are called negative, take a transverse or equatorial position. The latter are diamagnetic crystals, according to Knoblauch. A bare allusion to the subject is all that is proper in this place. m. HEAT. There are two sets of phenomena observed with crystals under the action of heat, in addition to phosphorescence and pyroelectric qualities. (a.) Crystals expand unequally in the direction of unequal axes, and alike in the direction of like axes. The monometric solids change equally in all directions ; but those of other systems have"], [185, "HEAT. 177 directions of least and greatest dilatation ; and these correspond with axial lines in the crystals. Any dimetric or hexagonal crystal dilates alike in corresponding parts about the vertical axis ; for the lateral axes of the crystal are equal. But the trimetric and clino metric forms have three unequal axes, and dilate unequally along these axes. Crystals are not only enlarged ; their interfacial angles are also varied. This change in the angles takes place in all crys talline forms, excepting those of the monometric system. Mitscher lich found that in calc spar there was a diminution of 8' 37\" in the angle of the rhombohedron, on passing from 32\u00b0 to 212\u00b0 F., the form thus approaching that of a cube, as the temperature in creased. Dolomite, in the same range of temperature, diminishes 4' 46\" ; and in aragonite, between 63\u00b0 and 212\u00b0 F., the angle of the prism diminishes 2' 46\", and lz : li increases 5' 30\" ; Nitratine is increased about 27' ; in gypsum I: ii is increased 5' 24\", /: 1, 4' 12\", and li : ii is diminished 7' 24\". In some rhombohedrons, as of calc spar, the vertical axis is lengthened, (and the lateral shortened), while in others, like quartz, the reverse is true. The variation is such either way that the double refraction is dimin ished with the increase of heat ; for calc spar possesses negative double refraction, and quartz, positive. According to Fresnel, the same is true of gypsum. The dilatation for calc spar, according to experiment, is 0-001961. Li nitre, an increase of temperature of 180\u00b0. changes the angle li : li, 44', but scarcely at all the angle i~: I. Dr. Kopp has shoAvn that in the carbonates of lime, magnesia, iron, manganese, and zinc, which are nearly the same in their crys tals, the vertical axis (axis ct) is shorter the greater the atomic vol ume. And since heat diminishes the density, and therefore neces sarily increases the volume, the axis a should be lengthened by an increase of temperature, as is actually the case. He has deter mined by calculation, that the change of angle for 180\u00b0 F. (from 32\u00b0 to 212\u00b0) should be 7' 37\", which is but 57\" less than Mitscher lich's observations \u2014 a near coincidence, when we consider the difficulties of measuring exactly the dilatation and change of angles. (p.) Crystals conduct heat according to a similar law to that of their expansion. This subject has lately been investigated by Senarmont. This author states that, from a point in a tesseral or monometric crystal, heat is conducted equally in all directions, so that the isothermal surfaces are spherical surfaces, concentric about the point. In crystals of the dimetric and hexagonal sys tems, (whose molecules are ellipsoids of revolution), the isothermal surfaces are the surfaces of concentric ellipsoids of revolution. In the other systems, (in which the molecules are ellipsoids not of revolution), the isothermal surfaces are surfaces of concentric ellip soids not of revolution. The correspondence with the phenomena of light is striking. 23"], [186, "178 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. Yet there are some points of difference. Quartz and calc spar differ, in the former being optically attractive, and the latter optic ally repulsive. , Yet both have a prolate thermic ellipsoid. Oblate thermic ellipsoids have, however, been found in idocrase, specular iron, and corundum ; and the most prolate occur in attractive crys tals. The heat rays appear thence to correspond to light rays which he beyond the extreme red. In calc spar, the proportion of the axes of the ellipsoid is 1-12 ; in quartz, 1-312 ; in beryl, 1-11; in idocrase, 1-13 ; in rutile, 1-27. In aragonite, the proportion of the horizontal axes is 1-22 ; in bournonite, for a perpendicular ellipse, parallel with the longer diagonal, 1-31, and parallel with the shorter diagonal, 1'29. In feldspar, augite, and gypsum, for the three principal elliptical sections, \u2014 1, vertical to the axis of sym metry, (a thermal axis), and 2 and 3, parallel to the axis of sym metry and one of the other two thermal axes : Feldspar.

The melting of the wax took place in circular or elliptical areas, according to the material, with great precision and uniformity for the same plate. A correspondence to the phenomena of light and heat in the un equal elasticity of crystals along unequal axes, was first observed by Savart.* M. Wiedemann,t moreover, has investigated the figures pro duced on different faces of crystals, by electricity acting on a light powder, or some kinds of oil ; and he finds the same general cor respondence between circular and elliptical areas and the axes, as was distinguished for heat by Senarmont. * Eecherches sur 1' elasticity du cristal de roche, etc., Ann. Ch. Phys. [1], xl, 113. f Poggendorff's Annalen, lxxvi, 1849."], [187, "SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 179 IV. SPECIFIC GRAVITY. The specific gravity of a mineral is its weight compared with that of another substance of equal volume, whose gravity is taken at unity. If a cubic inch of any mineral weighs twice as much as a cubic inch of water, (water being the unit), its specific grav- ity is 2, if three times as much, its specific gravity is 3, &c. In the case of solids or liquids, this comparison is usually made with water; but for gases, atmospheric air is assumed as the unit. It results from the nature of a fluid, that the weight lost by a solid immersed in water, is equal to the weight of an equal volume of water. The determination of specific gravity is, therefore, a very simple process. We ascertain the weight out of water, by weighing it in the usual manner ; we then determine the weight in water ; and the loss by immersion, or the difference of the two weights, is the weight of an equal volume of water : that is, if a mineral weighs 120 grains out of water, but 90 on emersion, it has lost 30 grains, which is the weight of a volume of water equal to that of the mineral. The \"mineral, consequently, weighs in this instance 4 times as much as the water ; for 4x30 grains equals 120 grains, which is the weight of the mineral. The rule for the pro- cess is, therefore, \u2014 Divide the weight out of water by the difference of weights obtained out and in water. The water employed for this purpose should be distilled, to free it from all foreign substances. Since the density of water varies with its temperature, a particular temperature has been selected for these experiments, in order to obtain uniform results : 60\u00b0 F. is the most convenient, and has been generally adopted. But the temperature of the maximum density of water, 39-5\u00b0 F., has been recommended as preferable. If a pair of scales is used for obtaining the weight, they should be exceedingly delicate, when perfect accuracy is required. For original investigations they should turn with the 1000th of a grain. The weights must be selected with care, and should vary from the twentieth of a grain to 120 grains. To weigh the mineral im- mersed in water, it may be attached to the scales by a single fibre of raw silk or a fine hair, and thus let down into a jar of water, care being taken that the scales be kept perfectly dry. The attach- ment of the fibre of silk to the scales may be made by means of a small hook attached to the lower part of one scale. For the ordin- ary investigations of the mineralogist, in the determination of species, it will be found most convenient, if the scales are not pro vided with this hook, to make a small hole through the centre of one scale, and through it attach a horse hair permanently to the scale. By tying a slipping knot in the horse hair, the minerals under investigation may be attached and detached without diffi culty, owing to the elasticity of the hair."], [188, "180 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. To insure accuracy, those specimens should be selected which are perfectly free from foreign substances, and contain no vacuities, even under a magnifying glass. If vacuities exist, they may usually be removed by coarsely pndverizing the mineral. An im palpable powder is apt to swim on the surface, although heavier than water. A better and more simple process than the above, and one avail able for porous as well as compact minerals, is performed with a light glass bottle, capable of holding exactly a thousand grains (or any known weight) of distilled water. Pour out a few drops of water from the bottle after filling it and then weight it. Then add the powdered mineral till the water is again to the brim, and re weigh it. The difference in the two weights, divided by the loss of the water poured out, is the specific gravity sought. The weight of the glass bottle itself is here supposed to be balanced by an equivalent weight in the other scale. Rose has recently observed that fine pulverization of a mineral, and even of a metal, gives uniformly a higher specific gravity than is obtained from the solid mass, and he considers the result therefore as involving a slight error. The mineralogist is so seldom required to take the specific gravity of liquids or gases, that an explanation of the different methods employed is unnecessary. V. CHARACTERS DEPENDING ON COHESION. These characters are of three kinds : \u2014 1. Hardness ; 2. Tenacity ; 3. Fracture. I. HARDNESS. A harder body is distinguished from a softer, either by attempt ing to scratch the one with the other, or by trying each with a file. Each of these methods is used by the mineralogist in determining the hardness of the species, though the latter is in most cases to he preferred. Both methods should be employed when practicable. Certain varieties of some minerals give a low hardness under the fie, owing either to impurities or imperfect aggregation of the particles, whilst they scratch a harder species, \u2014 showing that the particles are hard, although loosely aggregated. Chiastolite, spinel, and sapphire are common examples of this fact. \"When the mine ral is too hard to be impressed by a file, the peculiarity of the grating sound will suffice to the practised ear. To give a definite character to the results obtained with respect to the hardness of minerals, the distinguished German mineralogist Mohs introduced a scale of hardness. Mohs's scale consists often minerals, which gradually increase in hardness from 1 to 10. The"], [189, "181 HARDNESS, intervals between 2 and 3, and 5 and 6, are larger than the others. Breithaupt has therefore introduced another degree of hardness between each of the above, and thus his scale consists of twelve minerals. Mohs's scale is as follows : 1. Talc ; common laminated light green variety. 2. Gypsum ; a crystallized variety. 3. Calcite ; transparent variety. 4. Fluor Spar ; crystalline variety. 5. Apatite ; transparent variety. 5-5. Scapolite; crystalline variety. 6. Feldspar (orthoclase) ; white cleavable variety. 7. Quartz; transparent. 8. Topaz; transparent. 9. Sapphire ; cleavable varieties. 10. Diamond. If the file abrades the mineral under trial with the same ease as No. 4, and produces an equal depth of abrasion with the same force, its hardness is said to be 4. If with more facility than 4, but less than 5, the hardness may be 4\\ or 4^, written in decimals 4-25, 4-5. Several successive trials should be made to obtain certain results. The use of the file is acquired with very little experience ; usu ally a single trial is sufficient. Care must be taken to apply the file to edges of equal obtuseness. That part, also, of the specimen should be selected which has not been altered by exposure, and has the highest degree of transparency and compactness of struc ture. The pressure for determination should be rather heavy, and the file should be passed three or four times over the specimen. Rock salt is usually given in the scale of hardness for No. 2; but crystals are nearer 3. Many specimens present different degrees of hardness on dis similar faces; as an example of which, we mention kyanite and mica. This is confined to the inequilateral primary forms, and like the similar difference of color, lustre, &c, finds a ready explana tion in the theory of their formation ; unlike faces are the result of the action of unlike axes. This difference in faces parallel to unlike axes may be perceived in nearly all cases, when the methods of trial are exceedingly deli cate, fluygens long since observed that the cleavage face of a crystal of calc spar differed in hardness from the other faces ; and even in a monometric crystal it has been found that the faces of the cube and octahedron are not exactly alike in this respect.* * This subject has been examined by Frankenheim, (De crystallorum coh\u00e6sione, 1829, and Baumgartner's Zeitschrift fur Bhysik, ix, 94 andj 194), Seebeck (Hart mann's Jahrbiicher der Min. u. Geol. i. 123) and Franz, (Pogg. Ann. lxxx, 1850, 37)."], [190, "182 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. n. TENACITY. Solid minerals may be either brittle, sectile, malleable, flexible, or elastic. Fluids are either gaseous or liquid. 1. Brittle ; when parts of a mineral separate in powder or grains on attempting to cut it ; kerolite, calc spar. 2. Sectile ; when pieces may be cut off with a knife without falling; to powder, but still the mineral pulverizes under a ham mer. This character is intermediate between brittle and malleable ; gypsum. 3. Malleable; when slices may be cut off, and these slices flatten out under a hammer ; native gold, native silver. 4. Flexible ; when the mineral wiU bend, and remain bent after the bending force is removed; talc. 5. Elastic ; when after being bent, it will spring back to its orig inal position ; mica. A liquid is said to be viscous, when, on pouring it, the drops lengthen and appear ropy ; petroleum. The unequal elasticity of unlike faces of crystals has been shown by Savart in his Acoustic investigations, and he thus distinguishes the rhombohedral from the other faces in the pyramid of quartz crystal. m. FRACTURE. The natural fracture of crystalline minerals has already been noticed under clea/oage. The fracture of amorphous minerals varies in the form and kind of surface produced. 1. Conchoidal ; when a mineral breaks with curved concavities, more or less deep. It is so called from the resemblance of the con cavity to the valve of a shell, from concha, a shell ; flint. 2. Even ; when the surface of fracture is rough, with numerous small elevations and depressions. 4. Hackly; when the elevations are sharp or jagged; broken iron. VI. TASTE. Taste belongs only to soluble minerals. The different kinds of taste adopted for reference are as follows : 1. Astringent ; the taste of vitriol. 2. Sweetish astringent ; taste of alum. 3. Saline; taste of common salt. 4. Alkaline; taste of soda. 5. Cooling ; taste of saltpeter. 6. Bitter ; taste of epsom salts. 7. Sour ; taste of sulphuric acid."], [191, "183 CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF MINERALS. VH. ODOR. Excepting a few gaseous and soluble species, minerals in the dry unchanged state do not give off\" odor. By friction, moistening with the breath, and the elimination of some volatile ingredient by heat or acids, odors are sometimes obtained which are thus designated : 1. Alliaceous; the odor of garlic. Friction of arsenical iron elicits this odor ; it may also be obtained from any of the arsenical ores or salts, by means of heat. 2. Horse-radish odor ; the odor of decaying horseradish. This odor is strongly perceived when the ores of selenium are heated. 3. Sulphureous ; friction will' elicit this odor from pyrites and heat from many sulphurets. Bituminous; the odor of bitumen. 5. Fetid; the odor of sulphuretted hydrogen or rotten eggs. It is elicited by friction from some varieties of quartz and limestone. 6. Argillaceous; the odor of moistened clay. It is obtained from serpentine and some allied minerals, after moistening them with the breath ; others, as pyrargillite, afford it when heated. PART III. CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. I.

As the use ofthe table in deducing formulas involves the fre- quent multiplication of the oxygen per-centage, the multiples by the digits 1 to 9 are given, for the compounds of most common occurrence, at the foot of the two preceding pages.* The modes of combination and uses of chemical language are explained in chemical treatises, to which reference should be made by the student. A few brief illustrations are here added : By atomic weights is understood the combining proportions ofthe elements. For example, when iron and oxygen combine, they unite in the proportion of 350 parts by weight of iron to 100 of oxygen, or in some simple multiple of this ratio. The protoxyd contains one part or atom of each, and has therefore the atomic weight 450 ; the peroxyd (more precisely sesquoxyd) contains 2 of iron (2x350 = 700) to 3 of oxygen, (3x100=300), and therefore has the atomic weight 1000, (700+300=1000). To ascertain the per-centage of oxygen in this oxyd, we have 300 of oxygen in 1000 parts ; hence the ratio, 1000 are to 300 as 100 to the number of parts in 100; therefore dividing 300x100 by 1000 gives the oxygen per-centage. Hence too if we multiply the per-centage of oxygen by the atomic weight of the oxyd, we obtain as a result, after dividing by 100, the oxygen amount in the compound. For alumina, 46-7x642-5 -\u2022-100=300, the amount of oxygen ; and in this way the correct- ness of the oxygen per-centage may be verified. The mode of deducing chemical formulas may be illustrated by two or three examples. 1. We have an analysis of Red Silver Ore as follows: Silver 59-02, antimony 23-49, and sulphur 1749 per cent. It is desired to ascertain the relative number of atoms of each element in the compound. This number must depend on the weights of the atoms, as compared with the quantity of each, for the less the weight, the greater the number of atoms. The rule consequently is,- \u2014 -Divide the per-centage of each element by the atomic weight of the same ; as, 59-02 by 1350, the atomic weight of silver, and so on. (See preceding table). This process gives the relation, 0-0437 : 0-0146 : 0-0875, and dividing each by the smallest, to simplify it, it becomes 3:1:6, which is therefore the number of atoms of each, silver, antimony, and sulphur. The formula 3Ag+lSb+6S, or Ag3Sb S6, expresses this relation. * Since the printing ofthe first half of the preceding table, (and a portion also of the second volume of this work), an article has appeared in the L. E. and D. Philosophical Magazine, noting the fact that Eose's Niobium is properly Hatchett's Columbium, and that consequently the name Columbium should be given it. The true Tantalum of Berzelius is another metal. Hence, after Columbium, p. 184, the Symbol Cb should be written ; and for Columbic acid Cb. The atomic weight of Columbium is yet undetermined, though near that of Tantalum."], [195, "COMPOSITION OF MINERALS. 187 As chemistry makes known a sulphuret of silver consisting of 1 of sulphur to 1 of silver, and also a sulphuret of antimony contain ing 3 of sulphur to 1 of antimony, the ingredients are regarded as thus combined in the compound. The 3 Ag take 3S, making 3 AgS, and leave 3S for the lSb to form l(SbS4) ; so that Red Silver Ore is supposed to be represented by the formula 3AgS-fSbSs; or Ag'Sb, if the mark (') be used, as is common, for Sulphur. 2. An analysis of Feldspar gives in 100 parts, Silica 64-78, Alumina 18-38, Potash 16-84. Now if we ascertain the proportion of oxygen in these constitu ents we learn the ratio of the constituents, since we know that silica contains 3 of Oxygen, alumina 3, and potash 1. From the above table we find that 100 of silica contain 52-98 of oxygen; consequently if 100 give 52-98, the amount in 64-78 parts will be found by multiplying 52-98 by 64-78, and dividing by 100 ; or what is equivalent, multiplying 0-5298 by 64-78. So in 100 parts of alumina the oxygen is 46-7 ; hence the oxygen in 18-38 parts of alumina will equal 18-38x46-7-h100. In this way we ascertain that 64-78 of silica contain 34-32 oxygen, ) ( 12 18-38 of alumina \u00ab 8-58 \u00ab g ffM* 3 16-84 of potash \" 2-86 \u00ab J \u25a0 ( 1 Hence the amount of oxygen in the potash, alumina, and silica, is as 1 : 3 : 12. Now as each atom of silica contains 3 of oxygen, 12 atoms of oxygen correspond to 4 of silica : so also 3 of oxygen for the alumina correspond for a like reason to 1 of alumina ; and 1 of oxygen for the potash to 1 atom of potash. The compound therefore contains 4 parts of silica to 1 of alumina and 1 of pot ash. The next step in the usual method, is to determine how these constituents are combined ; how much of the silica with the pot ash, and how much with the alumina. Reference is made to the possibility or probability of certain compounds, which Chemistry alone can teach ; but aid is found in the principle, that the num ber of atoms of oxygen in each acid and base is usually some sim ple multiple, the one of the other. If in the above compound, 1 of silica be united with 1 of -potash, the ratio alluded to is 1 to 3 ; and if the alumina be combined with the remaining 3 atoms of silica, the same ratio holds. This is the mode of combination commonly adopted ; it is expressed in the following formula, the dots as explained, indicating the oxygen : tSi+ilSi'. The index 3 expresses the number of atoms of silica : had the 3 been written as a prefix, thus, 3S1 Si, it would have meant 3 atoms of a compound of silica and alumina."], [196, "188 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. The formula might also he written with equal precision, and without dividing the silica between the bases, as follows : (K+Si) Si4. In a similar manner, an analysis of Garnet affords the ratio of ingredients as follows : 8 of lime (3Ca), 1 of alumina (lil), 2 of silica (2Si), corresponding to the oxygen ratio 3 : 3 : 6 or 1 : 1 : 2. Appor tioning the silica to the bases, we have the formula Ca3Si+\u00a3lSi, in which the oxygen ratio for each member is 1 : 1. Idocrase and Meionite afford other simple examples. 3. In Feldspar, above cited, the protoxyd portion is often not potash alone, but part soda or lime. Again, in Garnet, the prot oxyds, instead of being alllime, may be part magnesia, protoxyd of iron, &c. In each case, however, all the protoxyds added [to gether, make up the same specific number of atoms as if there were but one alone. So the peroxyd portion may not be all of it alumina, but part peroxyd of iron, the amount of this peroxyd of iron being just equivalent to the deficiency in the alumina ; that is, an equivalent not in actual weight, but in atomic weight. In Garnet, as stated above, the oxygen ratio is 1 : 1 : 2 ; and what ever the peroxyds or protoxyds, the ratio still holds. Suppose an analysis of Garnet affords the per-centage, Silica 39-6, alumina 22-5, lime 32-6, protoxyd of iron 5-3 : we ascertain the oxygen in each constituent in the manner explained, (in the Silica, by mul tiplying 0-5298 by 39-6, \u2014 in the alumina, by multiplying 0-467 by 22-5, \u2014 in the lime by multiplying 0-2857 by 32-6, \u2014 in the protoxyd of iron by multiplying 0-2222 by 5-3) ; then on adding the oxygen ofthe protoxyd of iron to that of the lime, the amount just equals that of the alumina, as the oxygen ratio requires. Moreover the oxygen of all the protoxyds and peroxyds together equals the oxygen ofthe silica. As different protoxyds may thus replace one another, and as dif ferent peroxyds likewise admit of mutual replacement, itis common to write B as a general symbol for the protoxyds of a compound, and S for the peroxyds. It is also common to write the special symbols ofthe protoxyds which replace one another, in parentheses, with a comma between them. Thus in the Garnet referred to, in which lime and protoxyd of iron replace one another, the gen eral formula may be either B'Si+ilSi ; or (Ca, feJ'Si-f SlSi. The proportions of the lime and protoxyd of iron are not here stated, but may be ; if 1 : 2, the formula becomes ttCa+JFe)\"Si-)-*lSi. Again, the formula (Ca, ]&g)C, signifies that the compound is a"], [197, "189 COMPOSITION OF MINERALS. carbonate of lime and magnesia, in definite or indefinite propor tions ; (jCa-Kfig)<3 that the proportion is 1_: 1 ; (f Ca+\u00a3ivig)0 that the proportion is 2 : 3, f and ij having this ratio, and together equaling a unit. &C is a general expression for a carbonate of any prot oxyd. 4. The formula for Garnet, B'Si+ilSi, may also be written with equal precision as follows : (iB\u00bb+iSl)Si, the ratio 1:1:2 being still retained, and the fact being also pre sented to the eye that the oxygen of all the oxyds is to that of the silica as 1 : 1. In Gehlenite, another silicate of alumina and lime, the oxygen ratio is 3:3:4, which gives 6 : 4 or 3 : 2 for the ratio of the oxyds and silica, (that is, the oxygen of the silica is two thirds that of all the oxyds), while that of the protoxyds and peroxyds is 1 : 1. The formula may hence be E'Sit+KSil- ; or ($fc'-|4H)Si*. In the first of these formulas each of the two members has the same oxygen ratio 3:2; in the second this ratio is also retained, and is more briefly expressed, without the hypothetical idea that the silica in the compound is divided off between the protoxyd and peroxyd bases. 5. To deduce the per-centage atomic relations from a formula, the process above described is reversed. For example : for feld spar we have 4 of silica, 1 of alumina, 1 of potash. In the pre ceding table the atomic weight of silica is 566-25, and four times this is 2265. Setting this down and the atomic weights of alumina and potash below it, and adding, we have 4 of Silica 2265 1 of Alumina, 642*5 1 of Potash 588*86 Total atomic weight ofthe feldspar, 3496*36 Now if this amount (3496-36) of feldspar contains 2265 of silica, what will 100 parts contain ? Hence, to obtain the per-centage, we divide the atomic weight of each constituent in succession by the sum of the whole, and this gives the per-centage relation for each ; viz. Silica 64-78, alumina 18-38, potash 16-84. 2. Relations of Minerals, as exhibited in the Principles of Lso- morphism or Hom\u0153omorphism, and Dimorphism. The principle has now been long established that analogous elements, bases, or acids, may replace one another in compounds, without an essential change in the crystalline form of the species. Mutual replacement of protoxyd of iron, protoxyd of manganese, lime, and magnesia, in garnet, has already been alluded to. Sim ilarly arsenic and phosphoric acids may replace one another, and"], [198, "190 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. the crystallization remain unchanged, or with but a slight variation of angle. This capability of mutual replacement without change of form has been traced to a similarity of form in the replacing substances, and such substances are said to be isomorphous, (from ictos, equal, and pp-pi, form), or hom\u0153omorphous, (from ojjwioj, similar, and .\".opr-p*-]). Absolute identity of form between related species occurs only when the crystallization is monometric. In this system very wide variations in composition take place, through isomorphous substi tutions, without the slightest change of angle. There is a balance of forces in these equiaxial forms which is not overcome even when the substitutions are such as would make a difference of two or three degrees in a rhombohedral form. Thus in Garnet, mag nesium and calcium take one another's places with no change in the angle of the form, while the same substitution in a rhombohe dral carbonate makes a difference of nearly two and a half degrees. The term Isomorphism is hence strictly applicable only to mon ometric species, while LLom\u0153omorphism is of general application. The more important isomorphous groups of elements, bases, and acids, as regards the constitution of minerals, are the following : 1. Oxygen, Fluorine. 2. Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine. 3. Sulphur, Selenium ; Sulphuric and Selenic Acids, with also in part Tantalic, Columbic, Molybdic, and Tungstic Acids. 4. Chromic and Yanadic Acids. 5. Arsenic, Phosphorus, Antimony, Bismuth ; Arsenic and Phosphoric Acids. 6. Titanium, Tin ; Deutoxyd of Tin, and of Titanium. 7. The metals of the Hydrogen Group, (see beyond) ; their pro toxyds ; their sesquoxyds. In the Sulphurets, Cu or 2Cu replaces lPb, lFe, &c. Hom\u0153omorphism, as Laurent has observed, is not confined to forms of the same system alone. Thus Orthoclase and Albite, one monoclinic and the other triclinic, are in fact hom\u0153omorphous ; so also Natrolite and Scolecite; Epistilbite and Heulandite. The approximation of form between Idocrase and the monometric octa hedron may be regarded as hom\u0153omorphism, as stated by Laurent; and still as the monometric species undergo the various isomorph ous substitutions without a change of angle, it is a less satisfactory case than the others mentioned. The same element may crystallize in different systems, so that the two forms are unrelated. Carbon is an example, the diamond being one form, (monoclinic), and graphite another, (hexagonal). In physical characters, the two are different ; both as to hardness, specific gravity, color, optical characters, and also chemical reactions to some extent. This property of presenting two inde- pendent forms is called dimorphism, from 6,s, twice, and h-op^, form."], [199, "191 HOM\u0152OMORPHISM, DIMORPHISM. In some cases, the same substance has three independent forms. Thus carbonate of lime is sometimes rhombohedral, as in Calcite ; sometimes trimetric, as in Aragonite ; sometimes monoclinic, as in Barytocalcite. This is an example of trimorphism. Rutile, Brookite, and Anatase, are three forms of Titanic Acid. Garnet, Allanite, in part, and Biotite, are three forms of the same silicate. Carbon is regarded as actually trimorphous, the diamond and graphite, as just stated, being two forms or conditions, and charcoal the third condition. Two substances may be both hom\u0153omorphous aud correspond ingly dimorphous ; and they are then described as isodimoiphous. Thus both Titanic Acid and Oxyd of Tin are dimorphous, and they are hom\u0153omorphous severally in each of the two forms. This is an example of isodimorphism. There are also cases of isotrimorphism. Thus there are the fol lowing related groups ; the angle of the rhombohedral forms here given is R : R ; of the trimetric and monoclinic, I : I : Rhombohedral. Trimetric. Monoclinic. BC Calcite, 105\u00b0 5'. Aragonite, li6\u00b0 10'. Barytocalcite, 95\u00b0 8'. BS Dreelite, 93\u00b0-94\u00b0. Anglesite, 103\u00b0 38'. Glauberite, 83\u00b0-83\u00b0 20'.

Calcite, Aragonite, and Barytocalcite, are an undoubted case of trimorphism, the same compound (Be) occurring under these three forms. Dreelite, Anglesite, and Glauberite, constitute another like series, and moreover it is closely parallel in angle with the former. The difference between the angle R : R of Calcite and Dreelite is near that between L : L oi Anglesite and Aragonite, and also that between /: /of Glauberite and Barytocalcite. In the third line we have the sulphato-carbonate Susannite near Dree lite in angle, Leadhillite (identical with Susannite in composition) near Anglesite, and Lanarkite, another Sulphato-carbonate, near Glauberite, forming thus a third parallel line. The sulphuric acid in these sulphato-carbonates dominates over the carbonic acid, and gives the form of the sulphates enumerated in the second line of the table. The known cases of dimorphism among the elements are \"the following : 1. The two forms monometric and hexagonal (R : i?=82\u00b0-88\u00b0). \u2014 Arsenic, Antimony, Phosphorus, Bismuth, Palladium, Iridium, Iron (?), Copper, Carbon. 2. The two forms monometric and dimetric. \u2014 Tin. 3. The two forms trimetric and monoclinic. \u2014 Sulphur, Selenium. The hom\u0153omorphous groups among minerals are numerous, and in many of them species very various in composition are in cluded."], [200, "192 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. Before giving a list of them, the methods of comparison and evidence of true aflinity or homology may be briefly reviewed. Monometric System.\u2014 In this system, as the dimensions are un varying, the species fall into a single group, unless cleavage and hemihedrism are important distinctions. Cleavage is often of little importance. The two species Gray Copper and Tennantite, analo gous in composition, have one, an octahedral, the other, a do decahedral cleavage. Sylvine (chlorid of potassium) has a cubic cleavage, while the related compound, chlorid of ammonium, has an octahedral. Llemihedrism is often of value in marking off spe cies. It is a remarkable fact that while the protoxyd of zinc is rhombohedral, like the pero.xyd of iron and aluminium, and unlike other protoxyds, the sulphuret of zinc is tetrahedral,_ unlike most related protosulphurets. Again, the borates, Boracite and Rho dizite, are hemihedral; and so also are all minerals containing boracic acid, that crystallize in other systems, excepting those that are oblique in crystallization. On the other hand, the related compounds, FeS\u00b0 (pyrites), Co (S,As)', and Co As2 differ, the first two being hemihedral, while the last is not so \u2014 indicating apparently that the sulphur here determines the hemihedral character. Dimetric and Trimetric Systems. \u2014 In the dimetric system, there are two square prisms to each form, one diagonal to the other, and the axial dimensions of a species will vary according as we assume one or the other to be the fundamental prism. This uncertainty is one to be set aside by the best means we may have, and to be admit ted where analogies still leave it unremoved. The length of the vertical axis also varies directly according as one octahedral plane or another in a series is referred to the unit octahedron. There is often a number of planes, between which we may choose, one of which will give a vertical axis two or three times as long as another. Here is a second source of doubt. The planes assumed as those of the unit octahedron by crystallographers, are ordinarily so assumed because they afford a simple view of the relations of the planes ; and with no better evidence of correctness than this, they may lead to error, when we have in view a comparison of form be tween different species. Cleavage affords the best criterion with regard to the vertical prism, the cleavage prism being usually the true fundamental prism. But in some cases there are no vertical cleavages, and only basal or octahedral. An octahedral cleavage affords important evidence as to the fundamental octahedron, whenever it occurs. Frequency of occurrence of planes is another criterion, and one of some value in determining the true fundamental prism and the unit octahedron ; yet it is often a false guide. A striking example of its want of value in another system, is seen in Calcite, the funda mental rhombohedron of which is of rare occurrence ; also in Fluor, which is oftenest in cubes, although its cleavage is octahedral ; \u2014 so also in Quartz, Tourmaline and other species, in which the fun-"], [201, "193 HOM\u0152OMORPHISM. damental form is far less common than some of the secondary forms, if ever observed. Twin-composition parallel to an octahedron plane, is good evi- dence as to which is the true unit-octahedron, since twins are form- ed, with rare exceptions, parallel to planes of unit or primary value In the monometric system they occur only parallel to the three pri- mary sections \u2014 that is, parallel to a cubic face, an octahedral and a dodecahedral ; and they are almost always parallel to corresponding sections in the dimetric system. Still the doubt may remain whe- ther the plane of composition, if a unit plane, belongs to the fun- damental or diagonal series ; and it is possible that it may be some other than a unit plane. There is hence no criterion which is an unfailing reliance. All the several characteristics must be reviewed, and also the analogies with other species, in order to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. In very many cases, we may make out a relation in the angles of the series of octahedral planes occurring in dimetric species, when it is impossible to decide with certainty which plane in the series belongs to the unit-octahedron for the species. This serial relation is of the highest importance, and is independent of all the doubts above alluded to. It indicates a fundamental analogy between the species so related. Thus the table beyond shows that the oc- tahedron regarded as 1 in zircon and rutile, is identical nearly in angle with that considered \\ in Eagyagite ; and if these two planes have this relation, then the plane 2 of the former and 1 of the latter will be likewise related ; so that there is a serial relation be- tween the forms of the species. Again, 1 in zircon is nearly iden- tical in angle with the intermediate octahedron 2i of Scapolite and Hellilite. There is no valid reason for making this octahedron of scapolite one of the diagonal series ; and none also for assuming it as 2i rather than li or 4i, excepting the frequency of occurrence of the plane. This example and the further application of the same principle apparent in the table will suffice to illustrate what we mean by the serial relation of forms. In Trimetric forms, doubts are still more varied. It is first ne- cessary to decide which is the true vertical axis, as either of the three axes may be made the vertical. The best evidence on this point, is that afforded by cleavage, the prism of most perfect cleav- age being almost always parallel to the true vertical axis. The next point is to determine the unit vertical prism from which we may ascertain the relation of the lateral axes (b : c). This may be the clea/oage prism just alluded to. Yet in some cases two species evidently closely related in form, have cleavage paral- lel to different prisms. In Augite, in the monoclinic system, cleavage is parallel to a prism of 87\u00b0 6 ' , and in hornblende, close ly hom\u0153omorphous with augite, it is parallel to a prism of 124\u00b0 30' ; the last has twice the breadth of the other, \u2014 a simple mathematical relation which proves an actual analogy of form 25"], [202, "194 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. in the two species ; and this is sustained by finding that all the planes of one may be very simply deduced from the type of the other. Another criterion is afforded by twin composition, on the prin ciple already explained. Although as stated above, it is not al ways sure evidence, it is in very many cases of high authority. Similarity in modes of composition always suggests, if it does_ not prove, that species are related inform, and_ that the planes of composition are homologous. Thus we have evidence in the twins parallel to a prism near 120\u00b0 in angle, ofthe relation which exists be tween Aragonite, Cerusite, Chrysoberyl, Copper Glance, etc. ; and at the same time, of the wide discrepancy between Aragonite and Bournonite, and between Chrysolite and Chrysoberyl. The prism of Bournonite (115\u00b0 58'), near the fundamental prism of Aragonite, is only a secondary prism (if) ; the twins of Bournonite are formed parallel to the true fundamental prism of the species, that of 93\u00b0 40'. Chrysolite also affords no stellate twins like those of Chryso beryl ; the angle of its vertical prism is 94\u00b0 3', and it belongs to a different zone from that of Chrysoberyl. Chrysoberyl and Ara gonite, on the contrary, are closely related ; they have similar twins, and the former has a brachydome of 108\u00b0 26', the latter of 109\u00b0 39'. Additional assistance, but of less certain value, may be had by reference to the frequency of occurrence of planes, or superior lus tre or smoothness, and also by noting the resemblance in habit to species that are already well determined. After determining the true vertical axis and unit vertical prism, a unit dome or octahedron must next be ascertained, in order to fix the length of the vertical axis. Here twin composition, the fre quency of occurrence of planes, and rarely cleavage, come in to af ford help, yet only to afford presumptive, not demonstrative, evi dence. Analogies with other species chemically related, afford very essential aid, and should never be overlooked. N otwithstanding the doubts that may remain, we may, as in the dimetric system, discover a serial relation in the angles, and this is sure evidence of a true mathematical relation between forms. If we cannot decide whether the form which crystallographers have made the unit octahedron is in fact, the true unit octahe dron, we may discover that the angles of the forms \\ , 1, \\ or 2, are similar to a series in another species, and prove thus a true fundamental resemblance. Clinohedral Systems. In the Monoclinic System the same diffi culties exist. _ Of the three axes the vertical must lie in the clino diagonal section, but it may have any position in this section. A crystal in this system is hence like a wheel, any spoke of which may be made the vertical one. When there is distinct cleavage parallel to a prism, the axis parallel to the faces of this cleavage prism may be regarded as the true vertical axis. But the top plane"], [203, "HOM\u0152OMORPHISM. 195 of this prism is yet to be assumed or ascertained : either by taking a plane of cleavage, when there is one ; or one of twin-composition; or one of most frequent occurrence ; or one suggested by analogies with other species. The criterion appealed to by the crystal lographer is usually, simplicity in calculation \u2014 one of some im portance, but often misrepresenting the true relations of species. Rhombohedral System. The remarks on the Dimetric System apply in principle here. In this system, there are two hexagonal prisms to each species, one diagonal to the other, (one lettered /, the other i2) ; also two series of pyramids, one corresponding to each prism, (one lettered 1, 2, 3, &c, the other 12, 22, 32, &c.) Either series may be the fundamental series : and in a series ol pyramids, there may be a choice between two or three of them as to the unit pyramid. Hence the angle of pyramid 1 in one species, may be near that assumed by the crystallographer as 2 in another, and which might as correctly be made 1. In the table beyond, such relations are seen in numerous cases. The serial re lations in angle exhibited are devoid of hypothesis on this point. After the above explanations, the following tables are pre sented. In the Dimetric and Rhombohedral Systems, the accepted values of the planes are given, without conforming them to one or more types. In the Trimetric System, the related species for the different groups are reduced to a common type, and the values of the planes as adopted by the best authors, when not the same as taken in the table, are mentioned in parentheses. 1.

In the Dimetric System, there are two grand groups, the first (Rutile Group) consisting of Sections I, II, HI, and IV ; and the second (Idocrase Group) of Y and YI. The simple relation as to the vertical axis in the sections of each of these groups is obvious without further remark. In the first of these groups, the basal angle of the fundamental octahedron is near 90\u00b0 (4\u00b0 to 7\u00b0 above it), and in the second near 109\u00b0 28' ; or taking li of Idocrase as 1, the basal angle is also near 90\u00b0, but 1\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 less than 90\u00b0. In the hexagonal system, there are also several Sections, if we take the values of the vertical axis as usually deduced. But the second section becomes united to the first if we take the plane \\ as 1 ; and the IY, also, if we take & as 1, the ratios of the axes for the sections being of this simple kind. In Section Y, an intermediaet pyramid is very near in angle a pyramid in each of the other sections. The basal angle of pyramid 1 in this section is near 90\u00b0, and hence R : R in Calcite, &c, is near 105\u00b0, and to this angle many species approximate. In Section IY, the angle R : R is near 90\u00b0, but 1 to 6 degrees less than 90\u00b0. In Section HI, the angle R : R is also near 90\u00b0, but 2 to 5 degrees above it. There are close correspondences in angle between Hexagonal and Dimetric species, as the two tables exhibit to the eye ; and they indicate a kind of Hom\u0153omorphism ; for a like inclination of the base on a pyramidal plane is truer evidence of analogy or identity than equality in the calculated axes ; it is a correct measure of the relations in the ellipsoidal molecules of the two forms. With equal axes in a Dimetric and Hexagonal form, the inclination of O on li in the former will equal O on 12 of the latter ; but O on 1 in the two will diverge widely, because in one the lateral axes cross at 90\u00b0 and in the other at 60\u00b0 ; hence the unsatisfactory character of comparisons between the forms of the two systems made from the calculated axes."], [205, "HOM\u0152OMOEPHI8M. 197 Dimetric System.* * The angles given in the Dimetric System, are the inclinations of the basal plane 0 on the octahedral planes specified ; and in the Hexagonal System, those of 0 on different pyramids specified, (or rhombohedrons). The isomorphous groups of species presented in this and the following tables, have to a large extent been made out by other authors. Von Kobell as early as 1831 showed the relations of a large part of the dimetric species in principle as above presented. The alu mina group first indicated by Mitscherlich, was extended by Prof. G. Rose, who added the rhombohedral metals and Red Zinc Ore. Frankenheim and others have labored extensively in this department. The relations of the groups to one another in these several tables were first presented as here given by the author in the Jour. Lyceum Nat. Hist. N. Y. 1864, vi, 37, and Am. J. Sci. [2], xvii, 430, xviii, 35, and many additions to the groups were made by him at the same time, and to some extent in earlier papers. I.

It is important to observe that the regular octahedron is represented by these united domes or the rectangular octahedron, and not by the rhombic octahedron of these trimetric species, and hence the axes of this rectangular octahedron (and not those of the rhombic, or the crystallographic axes) are homologous with those of the regu lar octahedron. Antimony Glance is an exception to this remark, and probably also Bournonite and Polycrase. The relation of Topaz to Andalusite in form and formula, indi cates the hom\u0153omorphism of oxygen and fluorine. At the same time the divergence in the angle of the domes shows the distinct ive influence of fluorine ; and the same is seen in the relations of Chondrodite and Chrysolite, or in the unlike angles of the three types of Chondrodite alone. In Table H, section I has the macrodome near 60\u00b0 and the bra chydome near 70\u00b0 32', both monometric angles, and these angles necessarily require that the vertical prism should be near 101\u00b0 34' in angle ; and hence the frequency of angles near this. In Valentin ite the brachydome has exactly the angle 70\u00b0 32', and the axes have nearly the typical value 1 : Vj : v\u00a3. Section H has the macro dome of 70 to 75\u00b0 or near the brachydome of section I. Sec tion IH has the macrodome of 83\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, or near the brachy dome of section II, and 90\u00b0 is nearly a mean between the macro dome and brachydome. In section IV, the macrodome is between 114\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 in angle, and 120\u00b0 is nearly a mean between the two domes. The vertical axis in section HI is two-thirds that of section I ; and taking \\i as li, the two groups would coalesce. We hence perceive that in the change that takes place in a case of dimorphism from the monometric to these trimetric forms, the characteristics of the monometric system are still to a consid erable extent retained. In Table IV, Section I has the angle of the macrodome near 70\u00b0 32' ; II, brachydome near 109\u00b0 28' ; HI, macrodome near 109\u00b0 28' ; IV, brachydome near 120\u00b0. By a change of position, making one or the other of the lateral axes the vertical axis, many of the species might be referred to Table IV. Although the cleavage is opposed to this change, it is of interest to view the species in this way, in order to apprehend more fully all the relations of the forms. Hausmann nas thus compared the anhydrous sulphates and carbonates. The following Table (IV A) contains the species ofthe Tables I to HI, which admit of this change ; and in the first column, the particular dome is mentioned which is here made the vertical prism. In the following and preceding tables, the only changes from the fundamental forms adopted by other authors,* are such as de- \u00bb The fundamental forms adopted through the Descriptive part of this work, are ma<le to correspond with these tables, when there was no doubt as to the pro priety of it ; in other cases they stand as given by the best authors."], [211, "203 H0M\u01520M0EPHISM. pend on the simple ratios 1 : 2 and 2 : 3. The general principle is everywhere illustrated, that species may be hom\u0153omorphous and still vary by the simple ratios 1 : 2 or 2 : 3 ; a fact which has been illustrated by reference to augite and hornblende, and is also exemplified in the case of Andalusite, Topaz and Staurotide, and in other species.* Table TV.

In the Triclinic System, the feldspars (exclusive of orthoclase) make a natural group, having I: T nearly 120\u00b0, and character ized by a basal and clinodiagonal cleavage. Orthoclase is proper ly of the same hom\u0153omorphous group, although Monoclinic (or more probably Diclinic.) In the discovery of the first facts in Isomorphism, the grand principle was announced by Mitscherlich, that analogous com pounds of related elements were alike in crystallization, and the converse proposition was deduced, that similarity of form was evidence of similar or analogous composition. Dr. H. Kopp, in pursuing this subject, observed that such hom\u0153omorphous com pounds were closely similar in atomic volume, and he obtained the following results for the carbonates : in Table I, and this although not an observed prism, may be made the fundamental prism, as the mere frequency of occurrence of a form (that having the angle 129\u00b0 20' in Staurotide) is not necessarily proof of its being the fundamental form. But the plains of twin composition have complex expressions with either of these fun damental forms, and become simple (1, and li) only when the larger lateral axis is made two-thirds the usual length, in which case the prism is 109\u00b0 20'."], [213, "205 HOM\u0152OMORPHISM.

Subsequent investigation showed that there may be resemblan ces of form among unrelated compounds. A simple multiple re lation in the atomic volume was to some extent detected in such species, and this fact was regarded as the true explanation of the identity of forms. The author obtained simpler results by reduc ing the aggregate atomic volume of the compounds to a unit value by dividing by the number of atoms in the compound.* The fol lowing are examples of the atomic volumes thus obtained. 1.

Yet the range of numbers is wide. From the tables on the preceding pages the subject of Isomorph ism has a still wider extension. Some modification of earlier views are required, as was long since urged by von Kobell (1832.) \u00bb See Am. J. Sei. [2], ix. 1850, xii, 204."], [214, "206 CHEMICAL mineralogy. It is still true that similarity or analogy of composition may be exhibited in similarity of crystallization; and when forms are similar and composition is analogous, hom\u0153omorphism is evidence of a hom\u0153omorphism in the constituents of the compound. Thus the similarity of form between Tantalite and Heavy spar is evi- dence th'at tantalic and sulphuric acids are hom\u0153omorphous. But it is also evident that similarity of form may be independ- ent of relations in composition, and result from a certain mathe- matical dependence of the prismatic forms on the monometric. The elements are mostly monometric in one state or another ; and as the prismatic forms are derived from these elements, and often have a monometric form as one of their dimorphous states, the re- tained impress of the monometric forms, found in the angles ofthe domes, determines the prismatic angles, and leads often to identity of form when there is no analogy either in the nature of the ele- ments or their proportions in the compound. Among the striking cases of hom\u0153omorphism with unlike consti- tution, are the following: one group includes Sulphur, the Anhy- drous sulphates fis, Marcasite Fe S2, Descloizite 1VV. Another includes Childrenite a phosphate, Epistilbite a silicate, Orpi- ment As2 S3, Mispickel Fe (S, As)a, Aurotellurite (Ag, Au) Te\". Another contains Tourmaline a silicate, Nitratine a nitrate, Py- rargyrite a sulphuret, the Anhydrous Carbonates, Iodic silver. Again, along with arsenic and some other metals, there are pro- toxyds, as protoxyd of zinc, many peroxyds, (as of iron, &c.) and \"Wnlemite, a silicate of zinc. The tables are made up of similar examples. In many cases of hom\u0153omorphous compounds which are ap- parently dissimilar in composition, a resemblance may hereafter be detected when the true relations of the constituents are better understood. Hermann has discussed the varying composition of Scapolite, Epidote, Tourmaline, and other species, and explains it by suppos ing the mineral to include two silicates which are mutually re placeable. Thus for the Scapolite group, these silicates or \" heter omerous molecules\" are a, B8Si+2fiSi,\u2014 b, ESi+BSi, Meionite=\u0153; Edingtonite, which he refers to the group,=\u00ab+12 S ; Wernerite, one variety a+b ; another variety a+2b ; a third a+6b; a fourth, a+12b ; a fifth, \u2014I. This mode of explaining the facts is but partial in its bearing, and tends to give increased complexity to the subject, by multiplying points demanding ex planation. Scheerer endeavors to explain the relations of various magne sian species, hydrous and anhydrous, on the hypothesis that three parts or atoms of water may replace one of magnesia, and that three of alumina may replace two of silica. He thus reduces Talc,"], [215, "H0M\u01520M0EPHISM. 207 Steatite, and certain other magnesian silicates, to the hornblende type ; and another set of related species to the augite type ; and still a third group to the type ESi. But the so-called species refer red to are for the most part uncrystallized, and therefore not well adapted to settle questions in this department. Others have met some of the difficulties by the view that prot oxyds and peroxyds may replace one another, in the proportion of the oxygen they contain. It is found in Epidote and Idocrase, that while the protoxyds and peroxyds vary in their oxygen pro portions, the ratio of the sum of the two to the silica is constant. Now a fact that is thus a constant one for a species is a fundamen tal fact of the profoundest signification ; and there is hence the best reason to accept of the oxygen ratio between the oxygen of all the bases (protoxyds and peroxyds) and the silica as the es sential characteristic of the species. The oxygen ratio of the pro toxyds and peroxyds may still be in general a simple ratio, and this is probably true for the species mentioned, the two prevalent ratios being 1 : 2 and 3 : 2.* This relation may be expressed in the formula in the manner al ready explained, (p. 189), making 3B replace K ; thus the general formula (I), and two special formulas (2), (3), of idocrase, are, \u2014 (1.) (B3,K)Si, (2.) (4B3-Bfi) Si, (3.) (|fi3+f\u00bb)Si. In Tourmaline, as Rammelsberg has shown, there are five vari eties, differing widely in the oxygen ratios of the protoxyds, perox yds, horacic acid, and silica, and varying nearly indefinitely for the boracic acid, \u2014 the ratios for the protoxyds, peroxyds and boracic acid lying between 1:3:1 and 1 : 14 : 3. I et there is the con stant ratio 4 : 3 between the oxygen of all the oxyds, including the boracic acid, and that of the silica. -This ratio of 4 : 3 is conse quently the characteristic of the species. Disregarding this fact, and making the boracic acid replace silica, we obtain no common type of formula for the species ; Rammelsherg's formulas being (1.) B3Sia+3fiSi, (2.) E3Si!-|-4K\u00a7i, (3.) B3Si2+6fiSi, (4.) RSi+Sfigi, (5.) B'Si-f4fi'Si. But recognizing the true bearing of this ratio, we are compelled to place the boracic acid with the bases, and make it, on the principle stated, replace the other oxyds. The general formula is then (fi3, K, B) \u00a7i*. in which B\", fi, B vary between 1:3:1 and 1 : 14 : 3.f Thus the' mode of making the oxyds replace one another in the proportion of the oxygen they contain appears to exhibit the true simplicity of nature. * The whole oxygen ratio for B, S, Si in Idocrase, is 1 : 1 : 2, for one variety, and 1 : J : If (or 3 : 2 : 5) for the other. Adding the first two terms, we have 1 : 1 for the ratio of the oxygen of the bases and silica in each. f See further under Tourmaline, vol. ii, p. 271."], [216, "208 CHEMICAL MINEKAOGY. The correctness of this application of the principle alluded to, is proved by the remarkable isodimorphism of Tourmaline and Cal cite. R : R in these species is respectively 103\u00b0 and 105\u00b0. Now Calcite and Barytocalcite are dimorphous, and related carbonates. Moreover Barytocalcite and Euclase are quite nearly related in form* Therefore Tourmaline and Euclase are dimorphous. Moreover, since the accepted formula of Euclase is (fi;'si*, Tourma line and Euclase have on the ground taken, and no other, analogous formulas. Another example illustrating the fact that R3 and fi replace one another, is afforded by Spodumene and Augite. The crystalliza tion of these species is the same, and the resemblance is so close, that G. Rose, in his recent classification, places them together, al though this does not correspond with the principles of his system. The augite oxygen ratio for the protoxyds and silica is 1:2. Spodumene contains peroxyds, with the oxygen ratio 1 : 4 : 10. Adding the 1 and 4, we have 1+4 : 10 or 1 : 2, the true augite ratio, and thus the species are reduced to the common type. The formulas of the two species are therefore f.-a Aijgite, E3Si\" ; Spodumene, (E3,fi)Si3, or exactly (jfe8-f |fi)\u00a7i', the oxygen ratio of the oxyds in Spodumene being 1 : 4. Again, this principle brings together the hom\u0153omorphous spe cies Zircon and Meionite, in which the ratio is 1 : 1 ; so also Wil lemite and Phenacite, which, with the same ratio 1 : 1, are nearly alike in rhombohedral form and angle ; so also Danburite and Ax inite, both of which are triclinic. The fact that the protoxyds and peroxyds are thus mutually re placeable is further shown by the crystallization ofthe oxyds them selves. The protoxyd of zinc is well known to be isomorphous, in many species with the protoxyd bases ; yet it crystallizes in hexa- fonal forms, with the angles of alumina and other peroxyds. And ence it should also be capable of replacing peroxyds, and not only should this be true of protoxyd of zinc, but also of the other prot oxyds by which zinc is replaceable. The protoxyds may exist ap parently in two states, in one of which they replace protoxyds, in the other peroxyds. The peroxyd of iron is also supposed to crys tallize in octahedrons in martite, and if this be sustained, the ar gument is double-headed ; for we then not only have protoxyds with the hexagonal form of peroxyds, but peroxyds with the mon ometric form of protoxyds. The principle is sustained again by another well-known fact, that the peroxyds and protoxyds combine together and form monometric species, as in magnetite, spinel, etc f * See paper by the author, Am. J. Sci. [2], xvii, p. 216. f There are many examples showing that the rhombohedron of 84\u00b0 to 88\u00b0, and a monometric form are related as the two furms of a dimorph, and that there is thus a mutual dependence. Arsenic, Antimony, Palladium, present both form3, proving"], [217, "209 H0M\u01520M0EPHISM. Many deductions bearing on the principles of Chemistry might be deduced from the facts that have been presented,* and large citations might be. made from various authors. But the discussion has proceeded far enough to exhibit the be.iring of the subject on the classification of minerals. The arrangement which is explained beyond, is a systematic view of the hom\u0153omorphous groups of species under the several grand divisions ; and the parallel groups in the same division, which are analogous in composition, are ex amples of dimorphism \u2014 or, to use the more general term, of plec morphism. Cause of Dimorphism. \u2014 The occurrence of one of two forms of a dimorphous substance rather than the other, has been shown by Mitscherlich, Rose, and others, to result in many instances from the different temperatures attending crystallization. When a right rhombic prism of sulphate of zinc is heated to 126\u00b0 F., certain points in its surface become opaque, and from these points bunches of crystals shoot forth, in the interior of the specimen ; and in a short time the whole is converted into an aggregate of these crystals diverging from several centres on the surface of the original crystal. The small crystals, thus formed at 126\u00b0 F., are oblique rhombic prisms ; and the same form may be obtained by evaporating a solution, at this temperature, or above it. Sulphur crystallizes from fusion in oblique rhombic prisms, while the com mon form obtained by evaporation is a rhombic octahedron. Rose has obtained crystals of aragonite by evaporating a solution of carbonate of lime to dryness by means of a water bath, and crystals of calc spar by permitting the solution to evaporate in an open vessel at the ordinary temperature. The crystals of aragonite were minute six-sided prisms and double six-sided pyramids. They change to rhombohedrons of calc spar if left moist ; but if washed and dried at once, they remain permanent. By expos ing aragonite to a low temperature, the crystal falls to pieces, in consequence of the change to calc spar which takes place; or if the prisms hold together, they consist, after the change, of an aggregate of minute particles of calc spar.-j- Artificial ara gonite has been observed in the interior of a copper boiler used to supply hot water for household purposes at Port Eliot, Corn wall. The crystals were minute six-sided prisms, and were at- this correlation. The oxyds come under this system, the peroxyds presenting usually this rhombohedron, but sometimes its correlate ; the protoxyds usually the monometric form, but sometimes the rhombohedral. * We call attention to one point, the close hom\u0153omorphous relations of Sulphur, prismatic sulphuret of iron, (Mareasite Fe S1), and the anhydrous sulphates, tablj 2, p. 200; and of Orpiment A6a S3, and mispickel Fe, (S, As)'. In the former grouii, the sway of the Sulphur is seen ; in the latter, that of the Arsenic. The same domi nant sulphur influence is seen in the Sulphato-earbonates, Susannite having the form of Dreelite, (a sulphate), and Leadhillite the form nearly of Anglesite. + Bose, Lond. and Ed. Phil.

Yet it is proba ble that the nature of the solvent, or the presence of some ac cidental ingredient in the solution, may have some effect in changing the molecules ; but in general the only effect of these causes is to produce secondary planes. Rose did not succeed in obtaining aragonite crystals by mixing a strontian salt with the solution of lime, and shows that the strontia in arragonite does not alone produce the rhombic form. The presence of one base in place of another isomorphous with it, often decides the form, as with the soda in albite and pot ash in orthoclase, the latter causing a monoclinic form, the former a triclinic in a compound otherwise identically the same. n. CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. The chemical properties of minerals are ascertained (1) by the action of acids and other re-agents ; 2, by heat, concentrated by means of the blowpipe, assisted by various chemical re-agents ; 3, by chemical analysis. This subject, especially the last division of it, falls into the department of chemistry. Only the more ordinary chemical and blowpipe tests are here mentioned. I. CHEMICAL TESTS. The simplest use of acids consists in the detection of a volatile ingredient expelled by them. A carbonate is thus distinguished. The acids ordinarily employed are the sulphuric, muriatic, and nitric, and they are commonly diluted with one-half water. Car bonate of lime, when dropped into either of these acids diluted, gives off bubbles of gas, an effect called effervescence. Some car bonates require the addition of heat. Before making this trial it should be observed that the mineral is quite pure, as a carbonate in seams or fissures might give a fallacious result. Another gas of a pungent odor is obtained when common salt is subjected to the action of sulphuric acid ; and another of acrid character when cop per and some other metals are acted on by nitric acid. In such examinations with acids it is important to observe the odor of the escaping gas \u2014 whether very suffocating and disagreea- * Lond. and Ed. Phil. Mag. [8], xii, 330, 1841. t Pogg. li, 606, 1840."], [219, "CHEMICAL TESTS. 211 ble, or merely pungent ; also, its color, and the color of the solution. In many instances, solution is obtained without effervescence ; and often a mineral is but partly soluble, and the insoluble part is thrown down in the state of a powder ; frequently, it may be in soluble in cold, but soluble in hot acid. The fumes given off will sometimes redden paper tinged blue with litmus or cabbage liquor, owing to their acid character ; others will blacken paper that is charged with acetate of lead, because of the sulphur they contain. Others, again, will discharge the color of brazilwood in paper, a property of hydrofluoric acid, which acid, when driven off from a mineral by strong sulphuric acid, will also corrode glass placed over it. Another effect of the action of acids is the formation of a jelly. To accomplish this, the finely pulverized mineral is thrown mto a strong acid, and a gentle heat applied. After a short time, as the solution cools, it gelatinizes; or in other cases, partial evaporation is necessary hefore the jelly appears. In a few instances, a jelly may be formed with cold acid. By heating the mineral, this property is often destroyed ; but occasionally it takes place, with equal facility, before and after heating, and sometimes not at all until after heating. The minerals that gelatinize in this manner are silicates ; it arises from the separation of the silica in a gelatin ous state. The following are some ofthe more common chemical re-actions : a. Carbonates. \u2014 Effervesce with dilute muriatic acid, yielding a colorless inodorous gas, which gives a white precipitate when passed into lime water. The fumes slightly redden moist litmus paper and heat restores the blue color. b. Sulphates. \u2014 No effervescence with acids. When in solution, they give with barytic water a white precipitate not soluble in water, or the muriatic, nitric, or sulphuric acids. c. Nit/rates. \u2014 With strong sulphuric acid give white corrosive vapors of nitric acid. With heated muriatic acid yield an acid that dissolves gold, becoming at the same time yellow. d. Phosphates. \u2014 Well dried and heated in a glass tube with potassium, give a phosphuret, which in water produces phospliur- etted hydrogen, a gas which inflames on coming into the atmos- phere, and has a garlic odor. The phosphates generally dissolve unchanged in muriatic and nitric acids. In sulphuric acid thev are for the most part decomposed \u2014 forming double salts. With nitrate of silver the soluble phosphates, or neutral nitric solutions of the insoluble, produce a characteristic yellow precipitate of phosphate of silver. When molybdate of ammonia is added to a solution of any phosphate, and then muriatic or nitric acid in ex- cess, a yellow color soon appears, and after a while a yellow pre- cipitate is thrown down. e. Fluorids. \u2014 If a pulverized fluorid be subjected to the action ot strong sulphuric acid, in a platinum crucible, and heat be applied,"], [220, "212 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. fumes will be given off which will corrode a plate of glass placed over the crucible. /.

Any chlorid heated in sulphuric acid yields muriatic acid, which acts as just stated with nitrate of silver; or heated with oxyd of manganese, affords chlorine. g. Silicates. \u2014 Fuse in a silver crucible with three or four times their weight of caustic potassa or soda, yielding a silicate soluble in water, which gives with an acid a precipitate (silica) that dries to a white, insoluble powder, harsh to the touch. Many silicates gelatinize with acids, as already stated. They dissolve with effer vescence in strong fluohydric acid. h. Borates. \u2014 If a borate in powder is heated with sulphuric acid, and alcohol is then added, the flame will have a green color, especially on the edges. i. Salts of Lime. \u2014 In solution, even if dilute, give with oxalic acid or oxalate of ammonia a white precipitate insoluble in water or acetic acid, but very soluble in either of the stronger acids. k.

Compounds of ALangemese. \u2014 The oxyds heated with muriatic acid give chlorine. Heated with potash or its nitrate, the salts give manganate of potassa, which affords a green color with water, and a rose tint with dilute acids that is destroyed by sulphurous acid or organic matters. m. Compounds of Copper. \u2014 Mostly soluble in nitric acid. Me tallic iron in the solution becomes coated with metallic copper ; potash or soda produces a blue precipitate, which becomes black on boiling ; ammonia a green, which is soluble in an excess of am monia and becomes fine blue. n. Compounds of Zinc. \u2014 The sulphate gives a white precipitate with potash, soluble in an excess of this re-agent ; no precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen. Acetate of zinc affords an abundant white precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen. o.

Compounds of Tin. \u2014 Dissolved in muriatic acid, form a chlorid, which with chlorid of gold give a purple color, or if strong, a brown precipitate. q. Compounds of Mercury. \u2014 The protosalts in solution give with potash a black precipitate insoluble in excess ; with sulphu retted hydrogen a black insoluble precipitate ; with metallic cop per, they yield metallic mercury, which is dissipated by heat. \"With muriatic acid afford a white precipitate or calomel. r. Compounds of Silver. \u2014 Dissolved in nitric acid, a chlorid or muriatic acid throws down a dense, white, curdy chlorid of silver, which blackens on exposure, and is soluble in ammonia. With metallic copper it affords metallic silver. s. Gold. \u2014 Dissolves in nitromuriatic acid, (aqua regia), but not in either of the acids unmixed. The solution gives, with proto chlorid of tin, a purple precipitate, and with protosulphate of iron, metallic gold. t. Platinum. \u2014 Dissolves in nitromuriatic acid, and not in either of the acids unmixed ; the solution gives with muriate of ammonia a yellow precipitate, which heated in a platinum crucible gives metallic platinum in powder. n. ACTION WITH THE BLOWPIPE. The first of the following figures represents the simplest kind of blowpipe. It is merely a bent, tapering tube of brass, from seven to ten inches long, with a minute aperture at its smaller end. It is used to concentrate to a point the flame of a lamp or candle ; and this is done by blowing through it while the smaller end is just within the flame. After blowing awhile, the moisture of the breath often condenses in the tube ; and to receive this moisture, and prevent its passing out at the beak, the chamber at o (see 257 258 259 f. 258, 259) is usually added. The air chamber in f. 259 is a cylinder, into which the tube abc is screwed at c, and the smaller piece, des, at d. The point ef, screws off, and is made of platinum in order that it may be cleaned when necessary, by immersion in an acid. When the blowpipe is made of brass, it is usual to have an ivory mouthpiece, as it is more agreeable in the mouth. Silver is the best material ; and the point, at all events, should be of pla tinum. Wollaston contrived a conven ient pocket instrument on the plan of a common pencil case. The instru ment represented in f. 259 has a screw"], [222, "214 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. at b. On unscrewing it, the part be may be inserted at a into the part ab, and the two screwed together again. In this way it is as portable as Wollaston's, and has the advantage of being more easily made tight with the screw, and is less liable to get out of order. Operations with the blowpipe often require an unintermitted heat for a considerable length of time, and always_ longer than a single breath of the operator. It is therefore requisite that breath ing and blowing should go on together. This may be difficult at first, but the necessary skill or tact is soon acquired. Let the learner attempt first to breathe through his nostrils with his cheeks inflated and mouth closed. This accomplished, if the blowpipe is now put to the mouth, he will find no difficulty in continuing his respirations while the muscles of the inflated cheeks are throwing their contained air through the blowpipe. When the air is nearly exhausted, the mouth may again be filled through the nose with out intermitting the process of blowing. The chamber at o has been recently made of india rubber, with valves, which does away with all the difficulty. The blowpipe flame consists of two cones : an inner of a blue color, and an outer, yellow. The heat is most intense just be yond the extremity of the blue flame. The inner flame is called the reduction flame, and the outer the oxydation flame. A mineral reduced to the metallic state by the inner, may often be oxydized, or combined with oxygen, in the outer flame, where it is in con tact with the atmosphere. For oxydation, the beak of the blow pipe should have a large aperture, and the wick of the lamp should also be large : the heat may be that of incipient redness. The best flame is that of a lamp with a large wick, fed by olive oil. A common candle with a large wick will answer for most of the purposes of the mineralogist, and is most conveniently carried about. When used, the wick should be bent in the direction of the flame. To support the mineral in the flame, either charcoal or platinum forceps or wire may be used. The charcoal should be well burnt but firm ; that from pine wood is the best, as it burns with least ashes. The reaction of the carbon of the coal aids in reducing or decomposing many mineral species. A convenient kind of forceps is represented in the annexed figure. It is made of steel, with platinum points, ab, and pins at^,^>, for opening the forceps. The mineral kyanite, and also mica, are sometimes used for a support when more convenient means are not at hand."], [223, "215 BLOWPIPE EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. To test the presence of water or a volatile ingredient, the min eral may be supported near one end of a test tube, which may be three or four inches long, and the bore little larger than a quill. The flame is concentrated on the exterior of the tube beneath the assay, and the volatilized substance usually condenses in the upper part of the tube. By inserting into the upper end of the tube a strip of litmus or other test paper, it is ascertained whether the fumes are acid or not, the color of she paper, if so, changing to red. The specimen to be subjected to the flame of the blowpipe should be a very small thin fragment, especially when the mineral is not very fusible ; for fusion is often thus obtained, when impos- sible with a fragment without thin edges. A fragment as large as a pea might afford a score of pieces, large enough for a blow- pipe trial. Many minerals remain unaltered before the blowpipe, unless some substance be added to aid in the fusion or reduction. These substances are called fluxes. Those in common use are borax, car- bonate of soda, and salt of phosphorus or microcosmic salt* Care should be taken to obtain the fluxes pure, and for this purpose it is well to dissolve and recrystallize the borax ; and the soda should be tested for sulphuric acid, as any adulteration with this acid will give the glass obtained with silica, a brown or reddish color. These fluxes should be powdered and added to the mineral, and the whole assay should not exceed the size of a small pea. One fourth this size is better than larger. The soda should be added in small successive doses ; this flux is often absorbed by the char- coal, but generally reappears when the heat is sufficiently raised. Besides the fluxes mentioned, other tests are sometimes used, of which the following are the most important. a. Nitrate of cobalt in solution, for distinguishing alumina and magnesia. This solution should be pure, free from alkali and slightly concentrated. Berzelius recommends having a bit of plat- inum wire in the cork stopper, in order to take out a drop upon it when required for use. b. Boracic acid and iron wire, used in testing for phosphoric acid. c. Tin-foil, for using with certain peroxyds of metals to reduce them to protoxyds. The assay, previously heated in the reducing flame, should be touched with the end of the tin-foil ; a very mi- nute quantity of a metallic oxyd is often thus detected. d. Gypsum and fluor, used as tests of one another. When two parts of the former rendered anhydrous by heating, and one of the * This salt, a phosphate of soda and ammonia, may be made by dissolving sixteen parts of sal-ammoniac in a small quantity of boiling water, and afterwards adding 100 parts of crystallized phosphate of soda, boiling gently the whole, and then setting it away to cool. The salt of phosphorus is deposited in small crystals. If the heat be too great during ebullition, decomposition takes place."], [224, "216 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. latter, are mingled and heated, they fuse to a clear glass, which is a milk-white enamel on cooling. The globule from fluor and heavy spar is transparent when cold ; and that with sulphate of strontian is more or less frothy. c. Saltpetre is employed in discovering manganese, bringing out the characteristic amethystine color when the quantity of this met al is too small to color glass without this reagent. The heated globule is touched with the point of a crystal, just at the moment of suspending the blast. The melted mass swells, foams, and either becomes immediately colored, or is so soon, upon cooling. f. Anhyelrous bisulphate of potash, used for detecting lithia. It is kept in a coarse powder in a phial well secured from moist ure. g. Oxalate of nickel, or nitrate of nickel, used to detect potash. The nickel must be quite free from cobalt ; it may be tested by treating it with borax, with which it should give a brown, not a blue bead. h. Nitroprussid of sodium* for detecting sulphur. The effects of the blowpipe are various. Some minerals are volatilized wholly or in part, others fuse at a low temperature ; while others melt only on the edges, (then called subfusible), or are wholly infusible. Kobell has proposed the following scale for denoting in figures the degree of fusibility : 1. Gi'ay antimony. \u2014 2. Natrolite. \u2014 3. Cinnamon Stone, (var. of garnet). \u2014 4. Black Hornblende. \u2014 5. Feldspar. \u2014 6. Chondrodite. The fusibility, when equal to that of natrolite, is designated by 2 ; or if like hornblende, by 4, and so on. The fluxes are also often required in obtaining the pure metals from the metallic ores. The following are some of the reactions with the fluxes : 1. Silica, Silicates. \u2014 Silica dissolves with effervescence in soda. The silicates are decomposed by salt of phosphorus, and the silica is set free, often remaining as a silica skeleton in the globule. Co lumbia acid, on the contrary, forms a clear glass with salt of phos phorus. 2. Potassa, Soda, Lithia.\u2014 Soda gives an intensely yellow color to the flame, even when in combination : yet this color may be otherwise produced. Potash salts often give a violet tinge, and a lithia salt a red color to the flame ; but the presence of soda vi- * It is readily obtained by treating two parts of the powdered ferrocyanid of sodi um with five parts of common nitric acid previously diluted with its own volume of water. The solution when the escape of gas has ceased, is heated in a water bath, until a salt ofthe protoxyd of iron gives a slate colored (and no longer a blue) pre cipitate. It is then cooled, when a precipitate forms ; the liquid is next filtered and neutralized with carbonate of soda, when a green or brown precipitate goes down leaving it ruby colored ; this liquid is poured off and evaporated, a crystal lization takes place of nitrate of potash and soda, together with the new salt, the last in crystals of a splendid ruby-red color."], [225, "BLOWPIPE EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. 217 tiates the test by communicating its own color. A glass of borax containing potash becomes blue when a little oxalate of nickel is carefully added, and one of soda, brown ; and this holds good for the potash salt, although soda be present. A lithia salt fused on platinum foil, if soda be present, produces a yellow stain ; but this stain is produced also by other reagents. If a lithia mineral be mixed with one part of fluor finely pulverized, and one and a half parts of bisulphate of potash, the flame is red ; if no lithia is pre sent, it is faint violet. 3. Lime. \u2014 Lime and lime salts give a brilliant white light. They sometimes tinge the flame reddish, but more faint than car bonate of strontia. 4. Magnesia. \u2014 Magnesia and many magnesian silicates afford a clear rose-red color with cobalt solution, after a long heat. A fragment after heating, should be moistened with the solution, and then heated again ; the color deepens on cooling. Magnesia is not acted on by soda. 5. Alumina. \u2014 If a fragment of alumina, or if an aluminous sili cate, after heating to redness, be moistened by cobalt solution and again heated, but not to fusion, it assumes a fine blue cdlor. The harder species should be finely pulverized. The test is sure except when oxyds of certain metals are present ; and also when saltpeter is present, since it gives a blue color with silica and zirconia, and in some other cases. 6. Arsenic and Arsenical Compounds. \u2014 Give off usually arseni- cal fumes having an alliaceous odor when heated on charcoal or with soda. With many of the compounds heated in a tube, white arsenic or orpiment is condensed ; and with charcoal metallic arsenic is obtained on the tube in crystals. 7. Selenium and Seleniurets. \u2014 Give a horse-radish odor in the outer flame on charcoal ; yield in a tube a sublimate in the form of a dark red powder. 8. Sulphurets. \u2014 A glass made of soda and silica becomes red or orange yellow when sulphur is present. Heated on charcoal with soda and then adding a drop of water, the sulphurets yield sul- phuretted hydrogen, which blackens silver foil or test paper con- taining acetate of lead. Heated in a glass tube closed below, with litmus paper above, they redden the paper and yield often a sulphureous odor. A more delicate test for sulphur is the nitroprussid of sodium, as. published by Prof. J. W. Bailey. Heat by blowpipe any sul- phuret or sulphate (or anything containing sulphur) upon char- coal with carbonate of soda, put the fused mass into a watch glass with a drop of water, and add a particle not larger than a pin's head of the nitroprussid of soda ; there will be a magnificent purple at once. If this test for sulphur is tried upon parings of nails, hair, albumen, &c, the carbonate of soda should be mixed with a little starch, which appears to prevent the loss of any off 28"], [226, "218 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. the sulphur by oxydation. On winding up a piece of hair four inches long by coiling it around one point of a platinum support, moistening it and dipping it into the mixture of carbonate of soda with starch, and then heating by the blowpipe, the fused mass will give with the nitroprussid an unmistakable action indicative of sulphur. By careful management perfectly satisfactory results may be obtained from a piece of hair less than an inch long. 9. Tellurium and Tellurets. \u2014 Give fumes but no odor. Heated on charcoal, the oxyd covers the charcoal with a brownish yellow coating, and the inner flame directed upon this coating is tinged bright green. In a tube the fumes rise and cdat the glass, and when heated the coating melts into drops, which are but slowly driven off by the continued heat. 10. Chromium. \u2014 Oxyd of chromium with borax gives an emer ald green color ; but on platinum wire in the outer name the color nearly disappears. Chromic iron gives the same color, and it is brightened on the addition of tin-foil. 11. Antimony. \u2014 The ores of antimony afford fumes usually white on charcoal, which are inodorous. The oxyds form with soda on the platinum wire, a clear colorless bead, which becomes white on cooling ; on charcoal they are reduced. In an open tube, anti mony gives white fumes, which coat the glass, and vaporize easily on a new application of the heat, without fusion to globules. 12. Bismuth. \u2014 Fuses and gives off inodorous fumes. On char coal it becomes surrounded with a dark brown oxyd, which is pale \u2022 yellow on cooling ; the flame directed on the coating is not tinged ; ultimately the metal is wholly vaporized. 13. Titanium. \u2014 Titanic acid with borax yields a colorless glass, which becomes milk-white on flaming, if not without. In the inner flame the glass with little of the assay is first yellow and afterwards amethystine and transparent. With more assay on charcoal in the inner flame becomes dark blue or nearly black on cooling ; but it is pale blue afterwards on flaming. With salt of phosphorus, it forms in the outer flame a clear colorless glass ; in the inner flame, a red or violet-blue glass, when cold, especially if tin be added. When iron is present the color after heating in the inner flame is deep red on cooling. Siliceous titanic minerals, as sphene, do not give the reaction with borax, except after long heat ing in the inner flame with salt of phosphorus, and it is apparent only on cooling. 14. Tin. \u2014 Oxyd of tin is slowly dissolved by borax to a trans parent glass, which is transparent on cooling. With soda or cyanid of potassium on charcoal it is easily reduced ; and if borax also be added, a very minute quantity of tin may be detected when present in other minerals. 15. Cerium. \u2014 Oxyd of cerium affords with borax and salt of phosphorus, a fine red or dark yellow glass in the outer flame, which becomes white on flaming. The protoxyd changes to"], [227, "BLOWPIPE EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. 219 peroxyd, and the latter is not changed in the inner flame. In the compounds with silica, cerium is not distinguishable from iron by the blowpipe. 16. Lead. \u2014 Minium is black while hot, but at a low red heat changes to a yellow oxyd. The ores of lead on charcoal, with or without soda, are reduced ; unlike tin, they often give a coating of oxyd on the charcoal, when heated in the outer flame. 17. Zinc. \u2014 Oxyd of zinc with borax gives a clear glass, which is milk-white on flaming ; or with more assay, is enamel-white on cooling. In the inner flame on charcoal, fumes are given off, and a white coating surrounds the assay. With soda on charcoal, the ores, even when containing little zinc, afford the peculiar bluish flame of burning zinc, and the oxyd is deposited on the coal. With cobalt solution, a green color, while tin gives a bluish green. 18. Cadmium. \u2014 Oxyd of cadmium, even when in small propor tions in other minerals, when heated on charcoal deposits a red dish brown powder ; it forms from cadmiferous blende before the zinc begins to incrust the charcoal. 19. Copper. \u2014 Oxyd of copper gives a fine green glass -with bo rax, which becomes cinnabar-red on cooling. The ores are re duced on charcoal with soda, and a malleable copper-colored globule obtained ; when the copper is combined with oxyds that are reduced together with it, borax and tin should be used. If iron be present, the copper and iron are obtained separately. 20. Manganese. \u2014 Oxyd of manganese gives with borax in the outer flame an amethystine globule, (very deep, with much manga nese), which becomes colorless in the inner flame. With soda on platinum the oxyd gives a green color which is bluish green on cooling. When other metals are present, soda should be added, and then the bluish green color is obtained, even with less than one per cent, of manganese. 21. Iron. \u2014 With borax in the outer flame, oxyd of iron gives a dark red glass, which becomes yellowish or colorless on cooling. In the inner flame it affords a bottle green color, or a bluish green in a more perfect reduction. With tin the green color is hastened. The peroxyd becomes magnetic when heated in the inner flame. 22. Cobalt. \u2014 Oxyd of cobalt gives a clear blue bead with borax, which does not become opaque on flaming. As in other metallic species, the sulphurets should be roasted before testing for the cobalt. 23. Nickel. \u2014 Oxyd of nickel forms a dark yellow or reddish glass with borax, which is nearly colorless on cooling ; but with more ofthe oxyd, the glass is dark brown, while hot, and becomes red on cooling ; and with saltpetre in the outer flame the color is changed to a blue or deep purple, distinguishing it from oxyd of iron. Silver. \u2014 The ores on charcoal, with, if not without, a flux, are reduced to the metallic state. But when other metals are pies-"], [228, "220 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. ent, lead is to be mixed with the assay, with the borax, and thus an alloy of lead and silver formed, from which the silver may be obtained by cupellation. 25. Chlorids. \u2014 A dull green pearl, made by dissolving a little oxyd of copper in salt of phosphorus, becomes surrounded by a fine blue or purple flame if a chlorid be added, which continues till the chlorine is expelled. 26. Fluorids. \u2014 When fluorids are heated with salt of phospho rus previously melted in an open glass tube, the glass is coroded, and Brazil paper, placed within the tube, is turned yellow. The salt of phosphorus for this experiment should be free from all chlorids. If the fluorine is present only in small quantity the assay may be heated in the same way without the salt of phosphorus. 27. Sulphates. \u2014 Like the sulphurets, in their reaction with a glass of borax and silica. 28. Nitrates. \u2014 Deflagrate on burning coals, and also give off a red gas when heated in a matrass with a drop of sulphuric acid. 29. Phosphates. \u2014 If a phosphate be fused with boracic acid, and the extremity of a small iron wire be inserted into the melted globule, and the whole be heated in the reduction flame, the globule formed at the extremity of the wire will prove to be more or less brittle, when struck with a hammer on an anvil. As the bead cools, a flash of light is usually seen. Before this trial it should be ascertained that no sulphuric or arsenic acid is present, which also may form a globule with the iron ; nor any metallic oxyd reducible by the iron. 30. Borates. \u2014 When a borate is melted with three parts of the flux called Turner's reagent, (a mixture of two parts of fluor spar and one of bisulphate of potash), the flame at the instant of fusion is brightly tinged with green. This trial should be made in a dark place. For a more complete account of the blowpipe and of its use in chemical analysis, I would refer to the Treatise by Berzelius (Whitney's translation) and also that of Plattner. In addition to the instruments already described, the following are important: 1. A small hammer, with a slightly rounded face and a transverse sharp edge at the other extremity. 2. An anvil, or piece of steel 3 inches long, 1 broad, and T3g- thick \u2014 to be used for pulverizing minerals, for which purpose the specimen should be first wrapped in a piece of paper. 3. Platinum foil, for enveloping minerals that decrepitate. 4. Fine Platinum wire, bent at one end into a circle one or two lines in diameter ; it very conveniently holds the assay in fusion. 5. Cutting pliers, for separating small fragments of a mineral for assay. Cupellation. \u2014 Cupellation is a process by which one metal in ;an alloy is oxydized and absorbed by a porous material, and the other left pure. It is used for separating silver and gold from"], [229, "BLOWPIPE EXAMINATION OF MINERAL8. 221 lead. It is performed before the blowpipe by making a small rounded cavity in charcoal, about as deep as broad, (say i inch), putting in fine bone ashes a little moistened, and made smooth by pressure, and upon this, after drying slowly, the assay ; then heat ing in the outer flame. When the alloy of silver and lead is thus treated, the lead becomes an oxyd and is absorbed by the bone ashes, and the silver, though extremely minute in quantity, re mains as a brilliant globule in the cavity.* The ordinary process of cupellation is as follows: The assay is heated in a small cup (called a cupel) made of bone ashes, (or in a cavity containing bone ashes), while the atmosphere has free access. The heated metal is oxydated by the air passing over it, and the oxyd formed sinks into the porous cup, leaving the pre cious metal behind. In order to fuse the alloy and still have the atmosphere circulating over it, the cupel is placed in a small oven shaped vessel, called a muffle, (f. 261) ; it is of infusible stone ware, and has a number of oblong holes 261 through which to admit the flame from the fire, and give exit to the atmosphere which passes into it. The muffle is insert ed in a hole fitting it in the side of a verti cal furnace, with the open mouth outward and even nearly with the exterior surface of the furnace. The fire is made within the furnace, below, around, and above ; and after heating up, the cupel is put in the muffle with the assay in its shallow cup-shaped cavity. It thus has the heat of the furnace to fuse the assay, and the air at the same time is drawn in over it through the large opening of the muffle. The oxygen of the atmosphere unites with the lead of the assay, and produces an oxyd, which oxyd sinks into the cupel, leaving the silver or gold behind. The completion of the process is at once known by the change of the assay suddenly to a bright shining globule. In the cupellation of gold containing copper, lead is melted with the assay. The lead on being fused in a draft of air oxydi zes, and also promotes the oxydation of the copper, and both oxyds disappear in the pores of the cupel, leaving the gold behind, and the silver alloyed with it. In this process the gold is melted with three times its weight of silver, (a quartation, as it is termed, the gold being one part out of the four of the alloy), in order by diffusion to effect a more complete removal of the silver as well as the contained copper. The cupel is placed in the heated furnace, and the gold, silver, and lead on the cupel ; the heat is sustained until the surface of the metal is quiet and bright, when the cupel lation is finished ; the metal then is slowly cooled and removed. * A table by Prof. W. W. Mather, is contained in the American Journal of Science, [2], iii, 414, which gives the ascertained weight of globules of silver, of given di ameter's. Similar tables are given in different Treatises on chemical analysis."], [230, "222 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. The button obtained, after annealing it by bringing it to a red heat, is rolled out into a thin plate and boiled in strong nitric acid. This process is repeated two or three times with a change of the acid each time, and the silver is thus finally removed. At the United States mint, half a gramme of gold is submitted to assay. The assay-gold and quartation-silver are wrapped in a sheet of lead weighing about ten times as much as the gold under assay. After cupellation, the plate of gold and silver, loosely rolled into a coil, is boiled for 20 minutes in IJ oz. of nitric acid, of 20 to 22\u00b0 Beaume ; the acid is then poured off and another portion of strong er acid is added, about half the former quantity, and boiled ten minutes ; then the same again. The gold thus purified is washed and exposed to a red heat, for the purpose of drying and annealing it, and then weighed. HI. PSEUDOMORPHS AND METAMORPHIC CHANGES IN MINERALS. Pseudomorphs were formerly viewed as singular freaks of na ture, of occasional or rare occurrence. As science advanced, their numbers were found to be large, collections of them began to be made, and chemistry was variously taxed for their individual ex planation. At the present time they are looked upon as types and evidences of vast metamorphic changes and processes of de cay or reformation in inorganic nature, which have modified extended rock strata, and altered the structure of the earth's surface. The earliest systematic treatment of the subject was made by Haidinger in Brewster's Edinb. Jour., vols. ix, x. In 1843 ap peared the extended work of Blum, which has been followed by two supplements. Since then, the wide range of metamorphic action as illustrated by pseudomorphs has been discussed with ability, and many new developments by Bischof, in his Chemical and Physical Geology. The work of Volger on the history of minerals, issued the year past, follows up the same subject in some of its departments with critical care, and some original views. Various memoirs by other authors have also appeared, illustrating this important topic. Mineralogy is thereby becoming a living sci ence, and the active germ from which the science of Geology in some of its departments is to have its true development. More over, it is receiving a purification itself, by the thorough study of the liabilities of species to change, thus making known the causes of variations in analyses, and bringing to light the true types of the original species. A high importance is given moreover to these variations ; for each marks out principles that have operated ex-"], [231, "PSEUDOMORPHS. 223 tensively in the earth's history. Even the smaller differences in the varieties of species are proving to have an influential bearing on the alterations of these or other species ; and they have also become essential data towards discussing the origin and peculiari ties of associated species and the genesis ofthe beds of rock in which they occur. Every analysis has therefore a high interest, a special as well as a general value, and they cannot be too much multi plied, nor too fully presented in a Mineralogical Treatise. The formulas commonly given have their value, if they are right, which is not always sure. But the details of the analyses have a higher and wider importance, geological as well as mineralogical. Pseudomorphs have been classed under four grand heads : 1. Pseudomorphs by alteration: those formed by a gradual change of composition in a species ; e.g., change of Augite to Steatite. 2. Pseudomorphs by substitution : those formed by the replace ment of a mineral which has been removed, or is gradually under going removal ; e. g., petrifaction of wood. 3. Pseudomorphs by incrustation : those formed through the in crustation of a crystal which may be subsequently dissolved away ; often the cavity is afterwards filled by infiltration ; e. g., change of Fluor to Quartz. 4. Pseudomorphs by paramorphism : those formed when a min eral passes from one dimorphous state to another ; e. g., change of Aragonite to Calcite. These different kinds of change are not always distinguishable without special study. In some cases a change may take place through alteration of the surface, and then, this process ceasing, the interior may be dissolved out, leaving a pseudomorph like one of incrustation ; or a pseudomorph that appears to be a result of alteration, explicable on chemical grounds, may be wholly due to substitution simply. Again, changes of some Scapolites to a feldspar, and of Augite to Uralite, (hornblende), have been considered by Scheerer exam ples of paramorphism ; Scapolite being considered dimorph ous with some feldspar, and Augite with Hornblende. But while such paramorphic changes undoubtedly take place with Aragonite, their occurrence in these silicates \u2014 which are common associates in the same rock, and must have been formed under like circum stances \u2014 is hardly probable.

These examples of pseudomorphism should be understood as cases not simply of alteration of crystals, but in many instances of changes in beds of rock. Thus all serpentine, whether in moun tain masses or the simple crystal, has been formed through a process of pseudomorphism, or in more general language, of metamorphism. The same is true of other magnesian rocks, as stetatitic, talcose, and chloritic slates. The crystalline rocks often offer examples of a change similar in nature. The Graphite of these rocks may be but a pseudomorph (or metamorph) after some vegetable product, and as truly so as the petrified wood of more recent times. Thus the subject of metamorphism, as it bears on all crys talline rocks, and that of pseudomorphism, are but branches of one system of phenomena ; the chemistry is the same for both. The common change of pyrites, forming the main ingredient of the upper part of metallic lodes, to earthy red or brown iron ore, thus producing the gossan of miners, is an example of these pro cesses now in progress. In a similar manner, lodes containing copper pyrites are sometimes changed above to red or black copper ore, or impure chrysocolla, or malachite, mixed with which are the results of alteration of other minerals, (as iron py rites, arsenical pyrites, and other sulphurets and arseniurets), that were associated with the copper ores ; and often the gossan con tains disseminated silver or gold derived from the decomposed ores. These are cases of pseudomorphism, as truly as when a sim ple crystal of iron pyrites becomes limonite ; the mode of change and its laws are the same. In like manner, the erubescite of the upper part of a copper lode is a comparatively modern product, arising from the alteration of vitreous copper ; or copper pyrites and vitreous copper may have each proceeded from the yellow copper pyrites ; for the erubescite and then the vitreous copper usually disappear as the lode is more deeply explored. So, when Spathic Iron is the veinstone of a lode, it is often extensively changed to earthy brown iron ore, more or less impure from mixed ingredients. Again, phosphates and arsenates of copper, lead, &c, as well as carbonates and sulphates, are among the surface species, or those that occupy the upper part of metallic lodes ; they are the results of alteration within those depths to which atmospheric agencies penetrate."], [235, "227 METAMORPHISM. Causes of Change* The causes of change are the simplest and most universal oper ations about us. (1), The solvent power of ordinary waters, cold or hot, or of steam ; (2), the reactions, according to chemical prin ciples, of the ingredients dissolved in these waters, or in mineral or sea waters, heated or at the ordinary temperature ; (3), the pro cess of gradual oxydation to which some substances are liable, and the reaction of substances thus formed on the ingredients at hand, aided or promoted by electrical currents or heat ; (4), the action of exhaling gases from the earth, with or without volcanic action. Ordinary waters hold in solution, as is well known, more or less of mineral matter. The Professors Rogers subjected a large num ber of minerals in powder on filters to the action of water contain ing carbonic acid ; there were among them, different feldspars, tourmaline, mica, leucite, hornblende, pyroxene, epidote, axinite, garnet, prehnite, zeolites, steatite, serpentine, chlorite ; and in all cases the water that passed the filter gave evidence of the presence of an alkali, or lime, or magnesia, and some even gave the tests with the first drops. Pure water gave with many of them a sim ilar result, but more slowly. By digesting for forty-eight hours in carbonated water, hornblende, actinolite, epidote, chlorite, serpen tine, feldspar, mesotype, &c, they procured a quantity of lime, magnesia, oxyd of iron, alumina, silica, and alkali, and the dis solved ingredients of these minerals severally amounted to from 0-4 to 1 per cent, of the whole mass. The lime, magnesia, and al kalies were in the condition of carbonates, and the iron passed from the state of carbonate to that of peroxyd during evaporation. Thus forty grains of hornblende digested for forty-eight hours in car bonated water at 60\u00b0 F., with repeated agitation yielded silica 0-08, oxyd of iron 0-05, lime 0-13, magnesia 0-095, manganese, a trace. The silicates of magnesia, lime, and manganese, were especially ready in yielding to this action. These facts illustrate two important points : 1. That ordinary waters upon and through the earth's surface, are constantly active in dissolving and decomposing minerals and rocks ; and that even species reputed indestructible are thus acted upon. 2. That the waters are thus furnishing themselves with chemical agents for effecting other changes. These waters penetrate all rocks, as well as percolate through soils, or run in streams over the earth's surface. Hence the action is a universal one, everywhere going on ; and the results are uni versal. Bones, shells, corals, and animal remains generally are also sources of carbonate of lime, phosphates, and fluorids ; mid plants may contribute also potash and soda, and sometimes silica. * The following observations are derived mainly from Bischof's extensive work."], [236, "228 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. Carbonic acid is a constant ingredient of the atmosphere, and is dissolved by the rains as they descend ; and hence this active decomposing agent is present in ordinary waters. It is also a re sult of different mineral changes. Sulphate of iron along with vegetable matters gives oxygen to the carbon of the vegetable matter, and thus produces carbonic acid and pyrites or sulphuret of iron, and the large quantities of pyrites in coal beds shows on how grand a scale this process has acted. Sulphate of zinc in a similar manner produces carbonic acid and blende or sulphuret of zinc. Bischof observes that the carbonic acid which has thus been eliminated, must have been sufficient in quantity to make if together an atmosphere of carbonic acid equal in height to our present atmosphere. Again, decomposition of sulphurets pro duces sulphuretted hydrogen ; this by oxydation by means of the atmosphere forms sulphuric acid, and the sulphuric acid acting on limestone produces gypsum, it may be in extensive beds, and liberates carbonic acid. Sulphurous acid also forms about volca noes, which becomes sulphuric acid, with the same result. More over silica in waters accompanied by heat will decompose lime stone and liberate carbonic acid. Hence it is that this gas is exceedingly common in exhalations from mineral springs, and occurs more or less in all waters. The dissolving and decomposing action of carbonated waters is therefore general. The sea and all other sources partake of this character, and unite in carrying on the changes to which the pro cess leads. The chemical agents with which ordinary waters are generally supplied, are the following : Carbonic acid: carbonate of potash, of soda, bicarbonate of mag nesia, of lime, of protoxyd of iron; chlorids of sodium, of magnesi um, of calcium ; sulphate of soda, of lime, of magnesia ; silica or silicate of soda, of magnesia, of lime ; phosphate of lime ; with rarer ingredients, as fluorine, in some of* its compounds, nitrates, salts of lithia. Mineral waters contain the same ingredients only in larger quantities ; also, boracic acid and borates, sometimes traces of arsenic, copper, and other metals, bromids, iodids, sidphuretted hydrogen. The sea differs rather in the proportion of the salts than in their kinds. Chlorid of sodium or common salt is most abundant ; next chlorid and sulphate of magnesium ; then chlorid of potassium, of magnesium, sulphate and bicarbonate of lime, some silicate, according to Bischof, a silicate of magnesia), bromids, iodids, fluorids, boracic acid, and hydrosulphurets. The carbonic acid in sea water, most abundant about shores where animal life may contribute it by respiration, enables it to dissolve shells and corals, and form bicarbonate of lime.* * See on this subject, Bischof, Vol. I, p. 966, and elsewhere."], [237, "METAMORPHISM. 229 The following are the constituents of different natural waters in 10,000 parts : I, Sea water from near coast of France, Vogel; II, ib. near Havre, Riegel ; III, Mediterranean, Laurent ; IV, Geysers, Dr. Sandberger ; V, Rhine, Muller ; YI, Thames, near Twickenham, Clarke ; VII, Artesian well, near Vienna, Ragsky (containing also free carbonic acid, 4-44 cub. in. in 26 Prussian ounces) ; VIII, Salt Springs of Wiesbaden, Fresenius, (to the analysis add, chlorid of lithium 0'0018, chlor. ammonium 0-17, iodid of magnesium trace, bromid of magnesium 0-04, silicate of alumina 0-0051, arsenic acid 0-0015, traces of carbonate of baryta, strontia, oxyd of copper, and 32-2 cub. cent, nitrogen) ; IX, Marienbad, temp. 11-85\u00b0 C.

An alteration or decomposition may go on at slow pace, but it is all sure progress, and in process of time it will make itself apparent ; with past geological ages to work in, the results may be measured only by the extent of the earth's surface itself. Heat may occasion greater activity in these changes ; and the wide prevalence of thermal springs, and volcanic regions, extinct and active, and the foldings, elevations, and crys tallization of rock strata, show that this aid has been extensively given. The saline and other ingredients of waters are derived from various mineral species. Lime. \u2014 From Calcite, and related species, Gypsum, Apatite, much Pyroxene (some giving 20 p. c), Hornblende (12 p. c), Wollastonite (46 p. c), Scapolite (20 p. c.) and related species, Oligoclase (3 p. c), Labradorite (11 p. a), Anorthite (15 p. a), Andesite (5 p. c), Epidote (21 p. c), Allanite (10 p. c), Idocrase (33 p. c), Garnet (some 30 p. a), Axinite (20 p. c), Margarite (10 p. c.); also from shells, Bones, etc. Potash. \u2014 From Orthoclase (12 p. c), less abundantly from the other feldspars; Mus- covite (9 p. c), Biotite(8 p. c), Lepidolite (4 \u2014 10 p. c), Phlogopite (6\u201410 p. c), Nepheline (5 p. c), Leucite (21 p. c), some Tourmaline, Scapolite. Hence Potash is abundant in granitic and most feldspathic rocks. Soda.\u2014 From Albite (10 p. c), Oligoclase (8 p. c), other feldspars less abundantly. Nepheline or El\u00e6olite (16 p. a), some Scapolite (5 p. c), Acmite (10 p. c), some Tourmaline, some Mica, Analcime, and many Zeolites. Soda is therefore largely distributed in Granites, Syenites, and various igneous rocks, besides being so abundant in Seawater. Magnesia.\u2014 From Talc or Steatite (33 p. c), and Talcose rocks, Serpentines (40 p. c.), and related minerals, Chlorite (33 p. a), and Chlorite rocks, Pyroxene (some 20 to 25 p. c.), Hornblende (some 20\u201430 p. c), Chrysolite (50 p. c), Chondrodite (55 p. e.), Iolite (10 p. c), Biotite (18 p. c), Phlogopite (26 p. c), Spinel (20 p. e.)

Phosphoric Acid. \u2014 From Apatite and other phosphates; also sparingly disseminated in Basaltic and other rocks ; also from bones, shells, corals, and all animal re- mains, and soil which contains the results of their decomposition. The following are some of the modes in which the ingredients in waters act, and the results of the operations. Governing the whole, is the general principle in chemistry, that in decompositions the resulting compound is less soluble than the compound attacked. 1 Carbonic acid (C) in solution. a. Dissolves calcite (CaC), and thus aids in forming pseudomorphs by substitution after calcite, the new mineral present, as carbonate of iron or carbonate of man- ganese, taking its place. Hence Spathic Iron, Diallogite, etc., after Calcite. 4. Acts on Scapolite; combines with the lime and forms carbonate of lime (CaC); and when the lime is removed C if it continues to act, removes alkalies, as alka- line carbonates. e. Acts on Labradorite and the lime feldspars ; combines with the lime, making car- bonate, of lime, (Calcite). Hence part of the Calcite in amygdaloids. If too little C to take up all the lime, the rest separates as silicate of lime. Hence may come Wollastonite ; and with hydrous silicate of alumina, the zeolites containing lime; with alumina and silicate of soda from the soda of a feldspar, come the zeolites containing soda, and with infiltrating waters holding baryta in solution, those containing baryta. In the above process, part of the silica is set free as soluble silica ; hence may come silica in the form of rock crystal, agate, chalcedony, opal, common in amygdaloids. Also with the feldspars, atmospheric waters, in which there is little C, carry off part of the alkalies, and the rest separates as alkaline silicates, in solution, and leave Kaolin, (SP Si* fi*), containing 6ome disseminated silica, that is set free by the process. d. Acts on pyroxene, hornblende, trap or basalt, (usually composed of labradorite and augite,) and amygdaloid : if solution is saturated with C, lime is removed as carbonate of lime, also the magnesia as carbonate of magnesia ; and thus by the removal of the bases may come Cimolite. With less C, the magnesia is not acted upon until the lime is mostly removed, and if C is exhausted, the magnesia separates as silicate of magnesia; hence may come Saponite; and if iron is present, chlorite, both of which are common in amygdaloids. \u00ab. Acting on olivine, removes the protoxyd of iron and some magnesia, as carbonate, hence serpentine after olivine. Carbonate of magnesia is a common associate of serpentine. /. Dissolves gelatinous silica, and the silica crystallizes as quartz on heating slowly to 200 or 300 C. (Senarmont). 2. Alkaline Carbonate in Solution, (KC or NaO with water). a. Decomposes CaF (fluor spar), especially if heated, making carbonate of lime (Ca 0) ; hence the pseudomorph Calcite after Fluor. b. Acts on heavy spar, (BaS), heated to 80\u00b0 F, affords Witherite, and alkaline sul- phates, (BaC), hence Witherite after Heavy Spar. Temperature much below 80\u00b0, the sulphate is restored. Hence Heavy Spar after Witherite."], [240, "232 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. c. Acts on Celestine, (Sr S) heated to 80\u00b0 F., affords Strontianite (Sr CJ^and alka- line sulphates; hence Strontianite after Celestine. Similarly on Pb \u00bb?. d. Acts on Silicate of lime, decomposing it, forming Carbonate of Lime. e. Acts on pyroxene, the lime of pyroxene takes the C, and the alkalies take the place of the lime; hence Green Earth after Augite. The same on Scapolite; hence Mica after Scapolite ; and also, Algerite after Scapolite ; in a similar man- ner other altered alkaline forms. f. Acts on an aluminous hornblende, the alkalies are left, and Ca removed ; hence Mica after Hornblende. Or Fe and 5fg removed and Chabazite is formed, (oxy- gen ratio of which for bases and silica is 1 : 2, as in hornblende). g. Acts on phosphate of lime (apatite), producing carbonate of lime and alkaline phosphate ; hence Calcite after Apatite. h. Dissolves alumina, and may remove part ofthe alumina from aluminous minerals. t. Acting on Sulphate of Copper, forms carbonate of copper or Green Malachite, (Rose). k. Bicarbonate of Soda acts on Sulphate of lime and forms Calcite if the solution is very weak, (2\u00b0 Beaume); or Aragonite, if Btronger, (5\u00b0 or 6\u00b0) ; and hence ara- gonite in gypseous and saliferous deposits ; the same acting on sulphate of magnesia heated forms Carbonate of Magnesia; on sulphate of iron forms Carbonate of Iron, etc. ; on sulpho-arsenite of silver, forms Light red silver, Sen- armont. Potash in solution acting on gypsum forms calcite, the carbonic acid in this case coming from the atmosphere. 3. Alkaline Silicate in solution, (derived largely from decomposition of feldspars. a. Acts on sulphate or chlorid of lime, produces Silicate of lime, and sulphate of alkali ; hence Wollastonite. b. Acts on sulphate of magnesia, if heated, produces Silicate of magnesia and sul- phate of alkali. c. Acts on BaS or SrS, no decomposition. d. Acts on Mg Cl, produces Silicate of magnesia and chlorid of alkali. e. Acts on bicarbonate of lime, heated, a partial decomposition, complete only after a long trial; forms alkaline carbonate, carbonate of lime, and free silica; hence quartz, Ac, (in part) in amygdaloid ; and Quartz after Calcite. f. Acts on bicarbonate of iron, similar result. g. Acts on Magnesia Alba, similar result. h. Acts on carbonate of iron (FeC), and carbonate of magnesia, (J$IgC), together produces augite ?. i. Acts on aluminous hornblende, gives alkali removing lime, and forms mica; hence Mica after Hornblende. k. Acts on ferruginous grains, and forms Glauconite, (green grains of cretaceous for- mation containing alkalies). I. Decomposed when organic matter and an alkaline carbonate, which give rise to ammonia, are present, and silica separates, as opal, quartz, chalcedony ; a com- mon process. m. With phosphate of lime (Ca'P) or phosphate of alumina no action, even when heated ; and hence these compounds may coexist with alkaline silicates. n. Potash silicate acted on by solution of common salt, more or less changed to soda silicate. o. Decomposed by carbonic acid, if the silicate contains no more than l\u00a3 to 16Si ; and hence alkaline silicates and carbonates of alkali coexist ; so also silicate of soda and bicarbonate of lime, as in Cancrinite. p. Silicate of baryta in solution is changed by sulphate of magnesia, lime or Boda to sulphate of baryta. Silica in solution is often distributed through other minerals, and may thus give them an unnatural hardness. The hydrous magnesian silicates and zeolites appear especially to be at times affected by this cause. 4. Sulphate of Soda in Solution. a. Acts on chlorid of calcium, forms gypsum. b. Acts on chlorid of magnesium, forms sulphate of magnesia. c. Acts on BaC forms sulphate of baryta, (Heavy Spar). 5. Carbonate of Lime in Solution, as Bicarbonate. a. Acts on alkaline silicates, producing Silicate of Lime, Alkaline Carbonates, and free Silica ; hence Quartz, Ac, in rocks."], [241, "METAMORPHISM. 233 b. Acts on sulphate or chlorid of copper, and affords Sulphate of Lime and Carbonate of Copper. c. Dissolves fluor spar ; hence infiltrating waters in limestone dissolve out fluorids, (as Fluor Spar), and carry them to open spaces where they may crystallize. Perhaps the same with Apatite. d. Acts on sulphuret of iron and forms Sulphate of Lime and Carbonate of Iron, or Limonite by oxydation of iron. e. Acts on blende and forms Carbonate of Zinc, (Smithsonite). /.

Acts on Witherite (BaC) at ordinary temperature, producing Heavy Spar (BaS), hence Heavy Spar after Witherite. b. Acts on Barytocalcite.similarly ; hence Heavy Spar after Barytocalcite. c. Acts on Strontianite (SrC) ; heuce Celestine after Strontianite. d. Acts on Carbonate of Magnesia, producing Sulphate of Magnesia and Calcite. e. Acts on Silicate of Strontia, yielding silicate of lime, and Sulphate of Strontia, (Celestine). /. Acts on an alkaline silicate, affording Silicate of Lime. g. Dissolves Apatite, (6asj?). h. Acted on by organic matter, yields carbonic acid by deoxydation of sulphuric acid and lime, and forms sulphuret of calcium and water. t. Decomposed by steam, sulphuretted hydrogen produced. 7. Carbonate^ of Magnesia in solution as bicarbonate. a. Acts on Ca(5 and produces a double carbonate of lime and magnesia, or Dolo- mite; hence Dolomite after Calcite. b. Acts on sulphate of lime, and produces Dolomite ; hence Dolomite after Gypsum. c. Acts on silicate of lime, forming silicate of magnesia ; hence steatitic compounds. d. Acts on pyroxene, the carbonic acid taking off lime and leaving magnesia; hence Hornblende after Augite, Pyrallolite after Augite, Bronzite and Hypersthene after Augite. Further action, removing all the bases but magnesia, and adding magnesia in place of the lime, and water taken up ; hence Serpentine, Steatite, Talc, after Pyroxene. 8. Sulphate of Magnesia in solution. _ _ o. Acts on carbonate of baryta, (BaC), produces Heavy Spar, (BaS), and carbonate of magnesia, (SlgC) ; and similarly with carbonate of strontia ; hence Heavy Spar after Witherite, Celestine after Strontianite. 9. Silicate of Magnesia in solution. _ a. With carbonate of magnesia, (MgC), produces the siliceous variety of magnesite. b. Acts on SlgC, produces Steatite; hence Steatite after Magnesite. c. Acts on Spinel, produces Steatite ; hence Steatite after Spinel ; similarly for Chias- tolite, Feldspar, Augite, and many other steatitic pseudomorphs. 10. Sulphate of Iron in solution. a. Acts on phosphate of lime in solution, (from animal remains), and produces phos- phate of iron ; hence Vivianite ; similarly from sulphate of copper in solution, Phosphate of Copper or Pyromorphite. b. Acts on carbonate of lime, and'produces carbonate of iron and sulphate of lime ; hence Spathic Iron after Calcite. Similarly sulphate of zinc produces carbonate of zinc ; and hence Smithsonite, (ZnC), after Calcite. 11. Carbonate of Iron, (FeC), in solution, as bicarbonate. a. Acts on phosphate of lime, and produces Vivianite or phosphate of iron, (probably the common process). b. Acts on silicate of lime, and forms silicate of protoxyd of iron, Hisingerite, Pin- gerite, Chloroph\u00e6ite, Silicates of Iron, resulting from decomposition of basalt, and minerals containing iron. 12. Sulphuretted Hydrogen or Hydrosulphurets in solution, (produced by oxydation of sulphurets, or- by deoxydation of sulphates in water, through the intervention of organic matter with water). a Acted on by organic matter, a deposit of Sulphur, as in some sulphur water. 30"], [242, "234 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. 6. Acted on by sulphurous acid, a deposit of Sulphur, as about volcanoes, (2HS-f SO2\u2014 JHO+3S). c. Changed by oxydation through oxygen of atmosphere, to sulphuric acid and wa- ter, and some sulphur deposited ; and sulphuric acid, with chalk, or calcite, then forms gypsum, and gives rise to other sulphates; hence Gypsum after Calcite and Gaylussite. Hence gypsum beds and the sulphur they contain. d. The sulphur acid acts on augite, feldspar, Ac, in volcanic regions especially, and produces complete decomposition, separating silica as Hyalite, Quartz, sili- ceous incrustations, Sinter, forming also Cimolite, Pholerite, Lenzinite, Scarbro- ite, Ac. Lithomarge after Feldspar and Topaz. e. Acts on sulphate of zinc, and reduces it to sulphuret of zinc. /. Acts on carbonate or phosphate of lead, and changes it to Sulphuret of Lead or Galena ; on Native Silver, and changes it to Sulphuret. g. Acts on chlorids of the metals, and forms sulphurets; thus Blende, Pyrites, Galena, Copper Glance, Silver Glance, Bismuth Glance, Antimony Glance, Tetrahedrite (Durocher). 14. Oxydation. a. The protoxyd of iron is especially liable to peroxydation, when moisture is pres- ent; and compounds containing it, whether silicates or carbonates, often undergo alteration by this means. The protoxyd of iron usually passes to the state of a hydrous sesquoxyd (Fe3 fi') and then to anhydrous sesquoxyd (3Pe). Spathic iron (Fe C) often goes through these changes, becoming brown, black, and when finally anhydrous, red, unless it passes to the crystalline state. Py- roxene, augite and augitic rocks, mica, garnet, often show commencing decom- position in the peroxydation of the iron; if carbonic acid exists in the moist- ure, the iron may pass into the state of carbonate ; but then in many cases it passes soon to a hydrous oxyd. b. The protoxyd of manganese is still more liable to oxydation, and it may pass to two states of oxydation, with or without water. This liability is so strong that some species, as the phosphates of protoxyd of manganese, are seldom found in an unaltered state. The silicates become black, and several species have been made from analyses of the altered varieties. c. Sulphurets, arseniurets. Many sulphurets (RS2 or RS) change readily to hydrous sulphates, by an oxydation of the sulphur and metal (air and moisture being present) often developing nitrogen if the oxygen is derived from the air; or sulphuretted hydrogen if partly from the water; and frequently some sulphur is set free. The sulphates may then promote other changes. 15. Deoxydation. By means of organic matter, sesquoxyd of iron (3Pe) may be reduced to protoxyd (Fe) ; and thus a carbonate of iron may be formed if carbonic acid is present or is formed in the process. Hence spherosiderite. Sulphate of lime, of iron, of zinc, by the same means, maybe reduced to sulphurets, sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid often being given out at the time, the carbonic acid forming from the oxygen removed by the carbon of the or- ganic matter ; thus come Pyrites, Blende, etc., by the wet way; when a sul- phate, oxyd of iron and organic matter are together, pyrites may be formed; thus sulphurets may have been produced in fossil plants, as in Fuci. 16. Other reactions and results. a. Alkaline phosphates act on a magnesian salt and form phosphate of magnesia : also upon lime in Scapolite and form phosphate of lime. 6. Sulphate of baryta is rarely decomposed, like sulphate of lime, by organic mat- ter. Sulphate of copper in solution, in contact with porous limestone forms Brochantite. c. The decomposition of species containing iron, (as some augites, hornblende, Ac), gives rise iu many cases to silicates of iron, as Hisingerite, pinguite, chloro- ph\u0153ite, etc. d. Alkaline fluorids, acting on pargasite, may form Chrondodite (? ) ; with wollas- tonite, they are decomposed into alkaline silicate and fluor spar (CaF). e. Moisture, acting on anhydrite, water is absorbed and the species is changed to gypsum. Hence Gypsum after Anhydrite. Acting on other minerals it is more or less absorbed, and promotes their decomposition. Added to Labradorite, it may form Mesolite."], [243, "METAMORPHISM. 235 /. The degree of solubility of silicates of strontian and barytes accounts for their non-occurrence as species among minerals. g. In pseudomorphs of oxyds of iron after calcite, it is probable, as Volger urges, that the calcite first passes to the condition of spathic iron ; then to a hydrous' sesquoxyd (Fe2H3, Pe H2, or Pe S); then to an anhydrous sesquoxyd (at 160\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, C. Senarmont); then it may be by deoxydation to Magnetite (Fe Fe), or to Fe ; and then to FeC or carbonate of iron again, if carbonic acid is present. h. Carbonated waters dissolve silicate of zinc without decomposing it. i. Organic matter with heat to 1 50\u00b0 to 250\u00b0 G, reduces salts of copper or lead. k. Steam, acting for a period of time, will dissolve away or decompose many sili- cates; alter some sulphurets promoting their oxydation ; at a high temperature acting on Galena, it will carry off the sulphur as sulphurous acid and sulphuret- ted hydrogen and leave metallic lead ; acting on chlorid of iron, deposits Specu- lar Iron, regarded by Gay Lussae and Mitscherlich the origin of specular iron of volcanoes ; acting on chlorid or fluorid of tin, forms oxyd of tin or Cassiterite ; on the same of titanium, forms brookite, anatase, or rutile; on the same of sili- con, forms quartz: Daubree, (Compt. Rend. 1849, 227, 229), who observes that these minerals just mentioned (rutile, quartz and specular iron) are associates in the Alps; acting on the furnace product Ti Cy-f-3Ti3N, produces crystals of Anatase. I. Carbonate of lime is decomposed by silica at the temperature of boiling water, and carbonic acid expelled ; hence carbonic acid given out by many waters. It is thus seen that in the decomposition of a silicate, there may not only be a removal of the alkalies and earths, but in other ca- ses, a large addition of alkalies. It is also obvious, that no mine- ral can withstand the agencies to which it may be exposed, and even when apparently unaltered, changes may have already been begun. Bischof regards the feldspar called Andesine as Oligoclase from which some silica has been removed by the methods explained, and scapolites are considered as mostly altered, the Meionite oxy- gen ratio being taken as the true ratio of the unaltered species. Although these particular cases may be doubted, it is altogether probable that different feldspars and scapolite are liable to a loss of silica or other ingredients from this means. In several of the processes of alteration, silica is set free. This silica takes on the form of opal or quartz, according as it is soluble or insoluble silica, these being two isomerous states of the same species. Delesse has experimented on the loss of silica produced by the action of a potash solution, heated to boiling, on different igneous rocks in powder. He found no action on granite : but on porphy- ry a loss of 5-35 per cent., Basalt 7-60, Black lava 4-50, Obsidian 18-39, Retinite 9-50 to 12-23, Trachyte 17-06 to 36-00. There was also a removal of some alumina, the porphyry losing a trace, the Basalt 2-85 per cent., Black lava 2-60, Obsidian 3-78, Retinite 1-16 to 1-25, Trachyte trace to 2-39. The partially altered rocks were much the most easily acted upon, and those containing quartz the least. The Retinite, Perlite, Trachyte which contain the silica partly in the soluble condition or in easily attacked glassy silicates are most readily acted upon. The loss of alumina was greatest in the glassy rocks, and in those that contain augite."], [244, "236 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. The various recent papers on pseudomorphs by Haidinger should have attentive study in this connection. Various applications of the principles that have been presented will be found throughout the Descriptive part of this work. On these principles and others of like nature which science may de velop, the changes and origin of minerals and rocks are to he studied. Bischof, in all his discussions, has direct reference to Ge ology, and arrives at a Neptunian theory \u2014 making nearly all rocks by the \"wet\" way \u2014 in which few will follow him. The subject needs a much more extended investigation from the opposite point of view before the exact limits of the two agencies fire and water shall be appreciated. We have aimed in the preceding pages at a brief review of the elements of the subject, such as is appropri ate to a treatise on Minerals ; a fuller discussion pertains rather to Chemical Geology. As an appendix to the above, some further results of Chemistry in the formation of minerals, and the artificial products of furna ces, may be mentioned, although several of the processes appear not to be the out-door processes of nature.

Associated minerals may obviously have been either cotemporaneously or successively formed. If the former, the species were alike in the general phenomena attending their origin ; if the latter, there may still have been many circumstances in common, arising from their condition in the same rocks, or their dependence on the same sys tem of causes, or from the earlier contributing more or less to the material in the latter; or again, they may have no relation except that of relative position. The chemistry of the formation of species is therefore to be learned from a thorough study of all these con ditions, as well as from the principles of chemical science itself. This subject properly pertains to geological science : and we only pass in rapid review in this place some of the more frequent associ ations of mineral species.

TAXONOMY. I. MINERALOGICAL SPECIES. It has already been remarked, that the power of crystalliza tion in the inorganic kingdom is, in a certain sense, analogous to that of vitality in the other kingdoms of nature. As in these king doms, therefore, the existence of species and their peculiarities depend on the action of this vitality, so in the organic kingdom the existence and individuality of species are determined by the power of crystallization. It must be understood that the term crystallization, as here used, includes not merely the action of the attraction that aggregates the molecules in the formation of a crys tal, but also the power that fixes the form and condition of the molecule. Regularly crystallized minerals alone, therefore, are properly perfect individuals in the mineral department ; imperfect crystalli zations, like the monsters among organic bodies, have arisen from a suspension of the regular plan of nature by some extraneous in fluence. It would, hence, be theoretically correct, and in accord ance with the practice in the sciences of Botany and Zoology, to confine the term species to perfectly crystallized individuals, and in the descriptions, to give their characters alone, reserving for subsequent remark, the imperfect crystallizations or mineral mon sters. But inorganic nature differs from organic, in this essential particular, that while in the latter, exceptions to this regular organ izing action are but seldom observed, in the former, they are far the most numerous, perfect individuals being of comparatively rare occurrence. A mineral species, therefore, is any natural inorganic sub stance, composed of particles capable in favorable circumstances of combining by means of their mutual attractions so as to consti tute a crystalline solid. We thus include among mineral species the liquids found in nature, for they require only a proper temperature, or favorable circumstances of pressure, and a freedom from disturbing causes, to enable them to assume a regular crystalline form. The condi tions of liquidity, gaseity, and solidity, are only different physical OS"], [250, "242 TAXONOMY. states of substances, and are never admitted as specific distinctions ; much less can they separate one division of inorganic species from another, and thus be made a criterion for limiting the mineral department. We also include all natural inorganic products, in which a tendency to crystallization can be detected, although they have never been observed in regular crystals. We exclude all me chanical aggregates, which, as they are composed of heterogeneous particles, can never assume, from any innate powers, the forms of a crystalline solid. This definition implies that the substance in the case of each species is a definite chemical compound, as such only are of homo geneous composition. But chemical analysis is not therefore always an available test of the homogeneity of a crystal ; crystal lization is quite as generally important as a test of chemical com bination, and is often referred to for this purpose. The question still arises, what is distinctively a mineral spe cies ? By some authors, every separate chemical compound among minerals has been arranged as a separate species, however like others in crystallization or physical characters. But since it has been found that, in accordance with the principles of isomor phism, there are elements which may replace one another indefi nitely and still the form of the crystals remain the same, crystalli zation has been assumed as the only authoritative test of identity or distinction of species : and this idea has been the means of greatly simplifying the science. The species garnet would make, according to the old chemical view, a dozen or more species. The species hornblende includes a still greater variety of different chemical compounds. Indeed, as magnesia, lime, protoxyd of iron, and protoxyd of manganese, are substitutes for one another in all proportions, the species based on composition alone would be without number. Isomorphism has thus come to the aid of the science, and removed much perplexity. In some instances, however, this principle has seemed inadequate, and while those regarding the crystallographic criterion as paramount have retained together the varieties of like crystallization, others insist ing upon a seeming incompatibility of chemical formula have widely distributed them. The species Epidote and Tourmaline are examples. But research may yet discover a principle (if not already accomplished) which will embrace these seemingly anom alous cases, and establish the canon that individuals of analogous constitution which are one in crystallization, constitute a single species ; they are at least so far identical as to pertain naturally to a common group, whether we call it a genus, family, or species, or by any other name. The canon must be allowed some flexibility in the present state of science. Minerals are so seldom in distinct crystals, that it becomes necessary to weigh well what importance should be attached to other characters."], [251, "243 MINERALOGICAL SPECIES. After crystallographic characters, chemical composition takes the highest place, or rather both are on the same level. The physical characters differ much in value. 1. Lustre. \u2014 -The distinction of metallic lustre from non-metallic, is of the first importance ; but all the different kinds of non-metal lic lustre are sometimes presented by the same species. 2. Streak. \u2014 A highly important character, seldom varying with the color of the mineral. 3. Hardness. \u2014 The liability of some minerals to decomposition, their accidental impurities, and the mechanical states they may present, render this in certain instances a character of some uncer tainty. An allowance of 0-5 at least, should usually be made for variation. 4. Specific Gravity. \u2014 Subject to variation, like hardness, espe cially through variations in composition arising from impurities and substitution of isomorphous substances in the composition of species. 5. Color. \u2014 Subject to but little variation in those species that have a metallic lustre, and not without some value in the discrim ination of non-metallic minerals. 6. Diaphaneity. \u2014 Subject to wide variations in the same species. 7. State of Aggregation. \u2014 More especially useful among the metallic minerals, and occasionally among the non-metallic species. 8. Taste. \u2014 Useful only among the soluble minerals. 9. Fracture. \u2014 Seldom of much value except in distinguishing varieties. 10. Refraction, Polarization. \u2014 Of great value in determining the character of crystallized substances, whose form is not distinct. By these means, species have been distinguished when the mineral was invisible unless magnified. The properties of elasticity and conductility of heat afford analogous results. 11. Phosphorescence, Electricity, Magnetism, and Odor, are each of limited importance. \u2022 In the determination of minerals, and especially the institution of new species, the value of the above characters should be well weighed. With distinct crystals, identity or non-identity may be fully ascertained. And with two or more concordant chemical analyses, when the species is crystalline and homogeneous, the determination may be as satisfactory. But when not obviously crystalline, and especially if earthy and opaque, analysis is often unsatisfactory, as there may be reasonable doubts of the homoge neity of the substance. Physical characters, without chemistry or crystallography, seldom afford a proper basis for the institution of a species. \u2022 Haste in making species is the bane of the Science ; and every bad species, introduced through carelessness or a worse reason, cannot fail to prove a millstone to the reputation of its author."], [252, "244 TAXONOMY. n. CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS. In the classification of minerals it must be fully understood that we are dealing with but a small part of the third depart ment of nature \u2014 the Inorganic Kingdom. The term Mineral Kingdom, so often used, is fundamentally erroneous, although all natural products not organic may be embraced under it. The dis tinction between natural and artificial inorganic products is con venient for the student, but is contrary to strict science ; for noth ing authorizes the wide separation usually admitted but the neces sities of the school-room, or the fact that mineral information is the A B C of another science, and the basis of certain arts. Any classification therefore that can claim to be perfect, must take into consideration the whole range of inorganic compounds ; and each species should have its place fixed on the broadest principles of the science of inorganic nature. The fullest development of the science of Chemistry is required to give the classification its highest perfection. While considering the relations of Species, it should also be observed that some minerals are only the result of the decay or alteration of others. Eve?y species has its perfect state, and also its changes from the influence of various disorganizing causes, which, like disease in organic beings, result in modifications ofthe type, and it may be in the total destruction of the original mineral. We cannot therefore give the history of a species without embra cing these results of alteration, and we shall naturally cluster about the original species, others that originate in their decay, especially such of these results of alteration as are uncrystallized. As usually presented in full title among the other species, they are a burden to the Science. The Science will thus take on a consistent aspect and prove a more efficient handmaid to Geology. With this restriction, the classification of Minerals must flow directly from the principles of Chemistry. The true basis for the classification of compounds is found in the relations of the elements. These relations are indicated in a general way in the following classification of them. The elements exhibit their resemblances in their crystallization or isomorphous re lations ; and in their entering into like compounds with the same or analogous elements. Thus Iron, Chromium, Manganese, form both protoxyds and sesquoxyds, RO and R203 ; Sulphur and Selenium form acids RO3 ; Arsenic and Phosphorus, Acids R205 ; Tin and Tita nium compounds RO'. The affiliations are seen to be most intimate when the stable compounds, or those of most common occurrence, are alike. Iron may exist in the compound ROa like Tin, but still the metals are rather remotely related, as RO3 is the stable . and common compound of the latter, while it is not at all so of the"], [253, "CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS. 245 former. The principles of isomorphism, as well as other consider ations, remove Carbonic Acid far from Titanic Acid, although each contains 2 of oxygen. The arrangement of the elements is as follows : \u2014 1. HYDROGEN GROUP. Either RO, R'O3, or RO\", the most stable and common states of oxydation. 1. Hydrogen Section. \u2014 Hydrogen. 2. Iron Section. \u2014 RO or R!03, the most common or stable state of oxydation. Crystallization mostly monometric, sometimes dimorphous, and then both mon- ometric and hexagonal. \u2014 Gold; Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Iridium ; Mercury, Silver, Copper, Uranium, Lead ; Zinc, Nickel, Cobalt, Man- ganese, Chromium, Iron, Aluminium, Beryllium, Thorium, Cerium, Lanthanum, Didymium, Yttrium, Erbium, Terbium, Magnesium, Calcium, Strontium, Baryum ; Sodium, Lithium, Potassium. 3. Tin Section. RO3 the most common and stable state of oxydation ; crystal- lization dimetric. \u2014 Tin, Titanium. 2. ARSENIC GROUP. Oxyds include the compounds RO3 or R\u00ab05, these the most stable or common states of oxydation, and acting as acids. 1. Arsenic Section. R205* a common state of oxydation ; crystallization usually hexagonal, sometimes monometric ; or dimorphous, and both hexagonal and monometric. \u2014 Nitrogen ; Phosphorus, Arsenic, Antimony, Bismuth, Osmium, Tellurium (?). 2. Sulphur Section. RO3 the most stable state of oxydation ; crystallization, (in part), trimetric or monoclinic. \u2014 Sulphur, Selenium ; Tantalum, Columbium, Tungsten, Molybdenum, Vanadium. 3. CARBON GROUP. 1. Boron Section. The common oxyd ROs, either a base or acid. \u2014 Boron. 2. Carbon Section. The common oxyd RO2, always an acid. \u2014 Carbon. 3. Silicon Section. The common oxyd ROs, always an acid. \u2014 Silicon. 4. CHLORINE GROUP. Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine. 5. OXYGEN GROUP. Oxygen, Fluorine (?). The Hydrogen Group passes into the Sulphur Section of the Arsenic Group through Chromium, which forms an acid RO3 anal ogous to the v anadic ; also through Iridium and Palladium, which are in part rhombohedral in crystallization. The Arsenic and Sul phur Sections are united through Tellurium, which is most anal ogous in its characters to the Arsenic Section, but is not known to afford the oxyd R\"0\\ The Carbon Group is most nearly related to the Hydrogen Group through Boron, whose oxyd BOa may re place the peroxyd bases of Aluminium, Lon, &c.'t * Equivalent to ROs if the double atom of the element be taken as adopted in the table of atomic weights, pp. 184, 185. f The relations of the elements may be viewed as follows, adopting Laurent's theory with regard to the oxyds. The oxyds RO, R203, RO2, RO3, are equivalent to RO, RJO, RIO, RJO ; in which 1 of oxygen is combined with a metal in different"], [254, "246 TAXONOMY. The classification of the elements establishes the fundamental points in the classification of compounds or minerals. The elements of the Hydrogen GrouD enter as electro-positives, (1) Into compounds with elements of the Arsenic Group ; (2) Into compounds with elements of the Chlorine Group ; (3) Into compounds with elements of the Oxygen Group. The elements of the Arsenic and following Groups also enter into combination with Oxygen. There are hence the classes \u2014 (1) Sulphurets, Arseniurets, etc. ; (2) Chlorids, Bromids, etc. ; (3) Oxyds. In each of these divisions there may be Binary Compounds and Double Binary Compoitnds, the latter consisting of an acid in combination with bases, as the salts ; the former being bases alone, either singly or united together, as the ordinary sulphurets, oxyds, &c. The Binary Oxygen Compounds are either (1) Oxyds of Elements of the Hydrogen Group ; (2) Oxyds of Elements of the Arsenic Group; or (3) Oxyds of Elements of the Carbon Group. The Double Binary Oxygen Compounds or Salts, may be Salts (1) of Acids RO3 ; (2) of Acids R'O' ; (3) of Acids RO' ; (4) of Acids R'O\". Such are the main points in the classification followed in this work. In general principle it is like that of Berzelius, and there fore closely related to the systems adopted by various authors in mineralogy. The details of the system will be gathered from the synopsis given beyond. Analogous composition requires that species should be grouped together in the same division ; and species that are related in form constitute a natural group in such a division. From the facts already stated, it appears that boracic acid should be regarded as a base in all silicates. Datholite is related to Euclase as well as Sphene in both form and formula, if the bo racic acid is thus regarded; and Axinite has also the simple oxygen ratio 1:1. Again, titanic acid in the so-called silico-titanates, acts as a base, this acid RO2 united with RO being equivalent to R3Os, and replacing thus an ordinary peroxyd. See under Sphene, ii, 269.* The true relations of the anhydrous Silicates are made out by states, virtually equivalents, as they saturate equal quantities of oxygen. These states are R, Rs, Ri, Ri. The metals of the Hydrogen Section in the state ex pressed by R appear to be monometric and mutually replaceable ; in the state of Rl rhombohedral * in the state of Ri dimetric, as in Tin, Titanium. Chromium in the states R and R# is related to Iron ; in the state Ri it should be classed with Vanadium, as exemplified in the relations of the Chromates and Vanadates. Iron in the state of Ri (as in the deutoxyd) is related to Tin and Titanium. The dimor phous forms of a metal may depend on these different states or conditions. * Also a paper by the Author, in the Am. J. Sci. [2], xvii, p. 218."], [255, "247 CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS. taking, as the basis, the oxygen ratio between all the Oaxyds and the silica, as explained on p. 207. They may for the most part be grouped into four grand sections. 1. Oxygen ratio for the bases and silica 1 : 3. 2. Oxygen ratio for the bases and silica 1 : 2. 3. Oxygen ratio for the bases and silica 1 : 1. 4. Oxygen ratio for the bases and silica 1 to less than 1. The first group includes one or two doubtful species, Edelforsite a silicate of lime, Mancinite a silicate of zinc. The second includes Augite, Spodumene, Rhodonite, Beryl, &c, and is the Augite Section. The third includes Garnet, Chrysolite, Zircon, Meionite, Idocrase, Epidote, &c, and is the Garnet Section. The fourthin cludes Andalusite, Topaz, Staurotide, Kyanite, Sillimanite, Sphene, Euclase, Tourmaline, &c, constituting the Andalusite Section. Besides these, there may be another group, characterized by the ratio 1 : 1\u00a3, represented in Eulytine, (Bismuth Blende), and Leu cophane. The composition of Eulytine is however still in doubt. There are in some cases accessory ingredients, or an excess of base or silica, which cause divergences from these ratios, and in dicate another principle which should be recognized alongside of the prominent central one. Thus Hornblende and Augite are related in form and so closely in composition that they graduate into one another, and a mineral with the form of one may have the composition of the other. Yet the oxygen ratio of Augite is 1 : 2, and of Hornblende 1 : 2\u00a3. In Hornblende there is an addition therefore of one eighth to the silica, without removing the species from the Augite type. Meionite has the oxygen ratio for the bases and silica of the Garnet Section 1 : 1, and Bischof and Rose regard this as the true ratio of all Scapolite. The analyses of Scapolite give mostly the ratio 1 : 1\u00a3, and taking this (as is probably correct) as the Scap olite ratio, there is here an addition of one third to the silica, which does not interfere with close hom\u0153omorphism with Meionite. Again, Sodalite, Hauyne, and Nosean have a like trapezohedral form and also a common composition, except that one contains a portion of chlorid of sodium, another of sulphate of lime, anoth er of sulphate of soda; and the accessory ingredients do not inter fere with the fundamental resemblance of the species. In Ittne rite there is the same form and composition, with water as the ac cessory ingredient. Nepheline and Cancrinite are closely allied to one another both in form and composition, except that the lat ter includes a portion of carbonate of lime and soda ; this addition in Cancrinite causes scarcely any divergence from the angles of Nepheline. In Staurotide, the oxygen ratio for theperoxyds and silica is mostly 1 : \\ ; yet some good analyses afford the ratio 1 : \u00a7 ; and moreover there is a difference in specific gravity, corresponding"], [256, "248 TAXONOMY. with the difference of composition, the ratio 1 : \u00a3 being connected with the highest. In Andalusite the ratio is 1 : \u00a7 ; yet_ a chemist analyzing Andalusite and associated Kyanite finds this ratio for the latter, and 1 : \u00a3 for the former, in which last several analysts agree with him. The analyses of Sillimanite afford the oxygen ratios 1 : \u00a7, 1 : f , 1 : J, and perhaps also 1 : 1. The facts therefore go to show that there may be an addition to the amount of silica without altering the type of the species. In the Feldspars, Anorthite, a well characterized species, has the oxygen ratio for the bases and silica 1 : 1, as in Meionite. Oli goclase, Andesine, Labradorite, and Albite, are all Triclinic and closely hom\u0153omorphous with Anorthite. Yet these species differ from Anorthite in having an increased proportion of silica, and this silica is therefore added without changing the type. 1 : 1 is therefore the type ratio of the Feldspars, while 1 : 1, 1 : \u00a3, 1 : 2, 1 : f, 1 : 3, are the occurring ratios. The Micas illustrate the same principle ; the type ratio is 1 : 1, as with the feldspars. The Hydrous Silicates are also in many cases examples of the same, the water often not affecting the type, and the species, if the water is excluded, having an analogy in form and composition to anhydrous species. In characterizing the sections of silicates laid down, it is there fore necessary to recognize not only the type ratios for the group, but also the variations on this type that occur. It appears also preferable to make distinct sections of the Micas and Feldspars, as these species form natural groups by themselves. The Feld spar section is characterized by a ratio of 1 : 3 for the oxygen of the protoxyds and peroxyds, which ratio does not occur in the other sections of anhydrous Silicates. With respect to the Sulphurets and Arseniurets, an important fact is established by the hom\u0153omorphism of the species, as re cognized by Frankenheim, viz : that Arseniurets and Sulphurets are related in form, and also in formula, if the halved atomic weight of arsenic be adopted. Thus Fe S2, Fe (As, S)a, Fe As2, are related compounds. In the following synopsis, it will be observed, that the species of each division are associated on the ground of their analogy in composition and divided into groups, according to their crystalline forms. These groups are therefore in many cases mutually dimor phous, or rather pleomorphous. The many cases of pleomorphism among minerals and their exact relations, are therefore exhibited in the arrangement.* * The classification which is here adopted, both in its Berzelian features, and its grouping species of like crystallization together, is similar to that published in the last edition of this work. There are however many modifications introduced, es pecially in the arrangement of the Silicates ; and greater precision has been given to all of its divisions.

NOMENCLATURE. A systematic nomenclature like that for botany and zool ogy, is out of place in this science, except it be based upon re lations among the whole range of inorganic products. More over, it is not necessary nor desirable.* The number of minerals known is less than seven hundred, and the double names of Natu ral History, therefore, can well be dispensed with. The addition of the'termination ite or lite, (originally from X.\u00c6os, stone), answers sufficiently well the purposes of science. The best names allude to some prominent characteristic of the species; others are given in honor of those who have labored in the science, or in reference to a prominent locality of a species. It should be remembered that the use of names of persons emi nent in other sciences, or of such as are ignorant of all science, is wholly at variance with good usage and propriety ; moreover, an attempted flattery of the politically distinguished is degrad ing to science, and cannot be too strongly discountenanced. It is important that the names when taken from a locality, or the name of a person, should retain their original orthography ; and also when not thus derived, that they should be of Greek derivation.f * The author has here departed widely from principles deemed important in the first two editions of this treatise. The arrangement of Mohs, followed in the main in those editions, cannot stand the test of the developments of science. Even on its assumed ground of being a natural system, it is in many parts singularly artifi cial; being little better in some of its groupings than an ancient classification of plants which arranged the hard wood species in one group, the herbaceous in anoth er, or collected together flowers of a color. For it is on no better ground that the diamond is placed alongside of topaz and sapphire ; spathic iron near heavy spar, (instead of near calcite) ; graphite near psilomelane ; allophane with green mala chite ; mica in the same order with cronstedite, spodumene with prehnite; iolite with quartz and chrysolite : and so on. Yet in justice to this Mineralogist of merited celebrity, it should be said, that very many natural groupings were em braced in his classification \u2014 far more, indeed, than in any of the chemical systems of that time, for the latter refusing almost all reference to physical characters, and considering only the elements present, instead of the mutual relations of the con stituent elements, broke up species into fragments and strewed them about into most heterogeneous assemblages. f Von Kobell has published a valuable work on Mineralogical Nomenclature, entitled, \" Die Mineral-Namen,\" etc. Munchen, 1853."], [264, "PART V. DETERMINATIVE MINERALOGY. In the following Tables for the Determination of Minerals, the student is supposed to have the requisite means for determining the blowpipe and ordinary chemical characters of minerals, so far at least as to be able to test \u2014 * 1. The effervescence or non-effervescence with the three min eral acids. 2. The solubility, more or less perfect, in these acids, cold or hot, or the insolubility of a mineral in the same reagents. 3. The presence of water by subjecting the mineral in a mat rass or tube closed below, to the blowpipe heat. 4. The character of the water or fumes given off with the acids or heat, whether containing fluoric or other acids, or alkaline. 5. The blowpipe reactions for sulphur, phosphorus, boracic acid, and other cases of this kind. 6. The presence of arsenic, and each of the volatile metals ; also of copper, lead, &c. The student is advised to study well the use of the blowpipe, and the various effects of the fluxes ; and for this purpose Whitney's translation of Berzelius on the Blowpipe, (published at Boston), will be found the best guide in the English language.f Two tables are here given, one in which the general divisions are based on lustre, streak, and blowpipe and chemical characters ; and another, in which the species are arranged under the several systems of crystallization. * It is obvious that for correct results, the testing should be carefully performed. It is not sufficient in trying for carbonic acid, to'put a drop of dilute acid on the specimen; for carbonate of lime may be present as an impurity, and give rise to effervescence : a fragment should be tested in a test tube and its complete solution and effervescence to the end ascertained. To ascertain whether a mineral yields a malleable globule before the blowpipe with the fluxes, soda should be tried, if not successful with borax, and in some cases cupellation is necessary. f Plattner's \" Die Probirkunst mit dem Lothrohre\" (3d edit.', Leipzig, 1853) is a large and full work on the subject, giving the most recent facts, and including also reactions with acids and other chemical reagents."], [265, "DETERMINATIVE MINERALOGY. 257 Before presenting the Tables for determining species, a few facts upon some prominent minerals may be stated, that may aid the student in naming the specimens of his Cabinet. 1. Quartz. \u2014 No mineral is more common, or more varying in its colors, than quartz. It is the most abundant ingredient of gravel beds, of the pebbles of the fields, and of the sands of shores, as well as a characteristic ingredient of granite and many rocks. It will therefore be everywhere encountered by the student. He will hardly err in pronouncing a specimen to be quartz, whatever the color, if on trial he finds it equal to 7 in hardness, and there fore scratching glass with facility and not attacked by a file \u2014 not at all cleavable \u2014 infusible before the blowpipe \u2014 not acted upon by acids hot or cold \u2014 easily dissolved to a bead before the blowpipe with carbonate of soda \u2014 specific gravity not over 2-84. After a little experience, the hardness and absence of cleavage will suffice to determine it in almost all its varieties. Calcite. \u2014 The mineral next in abundance to quartz, and as varied in its aspects, is limestone or calcite. Here \u2014 a knife-point easily scratches the surface \u2014 a drop of dilute muriatic acid causes an immediate effervescence \u2014 the blowpipe does not produce fusion, but gives an intense light, and the mineral after heating is alkaline, (being reduced to quicklime) \u2014 the specific gravity is not over 2-8 \u2014 and when not compact massive, there is a very perfect cleavage. Zeolites. \u2014 The hydrous silicates of alumina and some alkali or earth (potash, soda, or lime) are often called zeolites. They are most commonly found associated together in cavities or seams in amygdaloidal rocks, though occurring also in other rocks, as gran- ite, &c. On page 317, Vol. H, several groups are mentioned. The Stilbite group is distinguished by its pearly cleavage ; the forms are often laminato-radiate, and a drusy surface of a crystalline mass is made up of narrow oblong projections. In Group IV, there is no perfect pearly cleavage ; the forms are often acicular, and radiated masses consist of slender fibres, with the exterior often made of the squarish blunt or acute extrem- ities of crystals. The other groups do not present fibrous forms ; the species occur mostly in short and stout glassy crystals, anal- cime showing usually faces of the trapezohedron (f. 39) and cha- bazite often in rhombohedrons which are nearly cubes. Hornblende, Pyroxene, Epidote. \u2014 These minerals fall among anhydrous species that are fusible before the blowpipe and have an uncolored streak. Epidote has commonly a characteristic yel- lowish-green color, and this variety is unlike any pyroxene or hornblende ; it shades into brown, gray, and grayish-white, and may sometimes be red. Hornblende and Pyroxene vary from white to black through grass-green and olive-green shades. Horn blende and Pyroxene are distinctly cleavable, and prisms when broken longitudinally often show a cleavage plane or splintery look; Epidote has no very distinct cleavage, and the crystals oo"], [266, "258 DETERMINATIVE MINERALOGY. and columnar forms have a more solid aspect, with a smoother surface, without any splintery appearance in the fracture or a tendency to further subdivision of the columns. In this last it resembles columnar Tourmaline, which is also distinct, from Horn blende in its more compact look, with no vertical lines of cleavage in the several fibres or columns. Hornblende and Pyroxene are often distinguished with difficulty when not in crystals, except by the aid of chemical analysis. The crystals of Hornblende are often six-sided prisms, with angles approaching 120\u00b0 (two angles of 124|*0 and four of about 118\u00b0) or rhombic prisms of 124-J\u00b0 ; while Pyroxene crystals are as commonly four-sided prisms near 90\u00b0 in angles, (87\u00b0 6' and 92\u00b0 54'), or eight sided prisms near 135\u00b0 in each angle of the prism. Feldspars. \u2014 The feldspars are 6 to 7 in hardness, and occur either in tabular crystals or cleavable massive ; never fibrous columnar and rarely granular ; the lustre is vitreous, sometimes inclined to pearly, and the colors are white to flesli-red com mon ; but sometimes bluish, greenish, and brown. There is one perfect cleavage, giving a smooth surface ; another less perfect, at right angles, nearly or quite, with the former : if at right angles the species is Orthoclase ; if varying three or four degrees from ninety, it is triclinic and therefore some other feldspar. Spodumene is a whitish, grayish, or pale greenish mineral, resembling a feldspar ; but it has two very distinct cleavages making between them an angle nearly of 1 35\u00b0. Micaceous Minerals.- \u2014 The following are the names of the only unmetallic minerals that are properly micaceous in any of their varieties \u2014 that is, which consist of very thin, easily separable lamin\u00e6 : 1. Muscovite, Phlogopite, Biotite, Lepidolite. \u2014 Closely related, with lamin\u00e6 elastic, unless they have undergone alteration \u2014 affording no water, or only a trace in a lube \u2014 B.B. fusing only on the edges ; with acids, little or no action ; with cobalt solution sometimes a clear blue, but usually dull. G.=2-75 \u2014 3*2 ; H.=l\"5 \u20142. See further, pp. 221 to 227. 2. Pyrophyllite, Margarite, Euphyllite. \u2014 Lamin\u00e6, (excepting in Pyrophyllite), rather brittle, colors white or pale, affording water in a tube ; B.B. fusing on thin edges ; Pyrophyllite swells out. With acids, little or no action ; a blue color with cobalt solution. G.=2-7 \u20143-1 ; H.=3-5\u2014 4-5, (1-5 in Pyrophyllite.) See pp. 291, 300, 303'. 3. Chlorite, Ripidolite, Clinochlore, Pyrosclente. \u2014 Lamin\u00e6 not elastic, flexible, _ affording water in a tube \u2014 feel often a little greasy \u2014 B.B. fusing on the edges, more easily than the preceding ; in cobalt solution no blue color. Somewhat attacked by acids; colors mostly dark green, except pyrosclerite, which is often reddish. See further, pp. 291-296. 4. Talc. \u2014 Like the last in most of the characters, but lamin\u00e6 more greasy, much softer, and less thin, and color mostly very"], [267, "259 DETERMINATIVE MINERALOGY. pale green; B.B. infusible, and with acids not dissolved; with cobalt solution, with some difficulty, a reddish color. 5. BruciU. \u2014 Somewhat like talc, whitish or greenish in color ; B.B. infusible, heated in a tube affords water ; in the acids entirely soluble without effervescence. See further, p. 133. 6. Diallage, Hypersthene, Bronzite, Clintonite, Chloritoid. \u2014 Often nearly micaceous, though more properly foliated. The lamin\u00e6 are brittle, and do not separate easily. The same is true of Marmolite, which has some resemblance to talc, and differs from the species just enumerated in having a greasy feel. 7. Gypsum. \u2014 A crystallized variety : it is very soft, lamin\u00e6 sep arable, hardly flexible without breaking, often transparent, and generally colorless. B.B. whitens and crumbles, but fuses only with difficulty. 8. Uranite, (p. 430), Red Zinc Ore, (p. 110), Copper Mica, (p. 428). \u2014 Uranite is bright green, or yellow ; Red Zinc Ore is bright or deep red ; Copper Mica is deep green. Crystals of Uranite are square tables, and those of Copper Mica hexagonal. Copper Mica gives a copper reaction ; Red Zinc Ore is oxyd of zinc. Erythrine (Cobalt Bloom) is peach-blossom red in color, with often a bluish tinge. Pharmacolite and Vivianite have also a very perfect cleavage in one direction. The classification in the body of the work may be conveniently used in determining species. A specimen, for example, may be easily ascertained to be a sulphate, and next a hydrous sulphate, if such ; and then by turning to the section containing hydrous sulphates, a few further trials will enable the student to ascertain which of the species described he has in hand. To facilitate the use of the work in this way, a few remarks on certain compounds, in addition to those to be derived from the chapter on chemical tests and blowpipe analysis, are here offered, and also an index to some of the prominent classes of species. Sulphurets, Sulphates. \u2014 Sulphurets may have a metallic lustre, or an unmetallic lustre with a colored streak. Only Blende (sul- phuret of zinc) and Voltzite (an oxysulphuret of zinc) have an un- metallic lustre and an uncolored streak. Consequently, with these exceptions, any unmetallic species with an uncolored streak which contains freely of sulphur, must be a sulphate. The sulphates are all unmetallic in lustre, and they are often colorless. Helvin, Hauyne, and Nosean are silicates containing a very little sul- phur. Phosphates. \u2014 All the phosphates have an unmetallic lustre. The streak may be colored or uncolored. None of them are soluble m water, or have taste, excepting a single phosphate of ammonia ; and the pure phosphates give no odor in any way before the blow pipe. Besides the direct test for phosphorus, the tests for carbonic acid, boracic acid, sulphur, separate them from the carbonates,"], [268, "260 DETERMINATIVE MINERALOGY. borates, and sulphates ; the test for fluorine from fluorids, although traces of fluorine often occur in phosphates ; the complete solu bility (without gelatinizing) in muriatic acid, hot or cold, dis tinguishes them from the silicates. There are the following ex ceptions to this last character : viz., Xenotime, Childrenite, Mona zite, Turquois, Lazulite, which are also B.B. infusible. Molybdates, Tungstates. \u2014 The Molybdates and Tungstates are un metallic in lustre. The streak is colored, (yellow or yellowish, rarely red from chrome,) excepting in Scheelite, which is often white. Specific gravity never under 6. Columbates, Tantalates. \u2014 Mostly submetallic in lustre, with an iron-black, velvet-black, or brownish black color. But Wohlerite and Pyrochlore are yellow to brown, and Yttrocolumbite yellow to black ; streak yellowish to nearly colorless.

In the Descriptions of Species, tbe characteristics are mentioned in the fol lowing order : \u2014 1, Structure ; 2, Hardness, Specific gravity, Lustre, Color, Diaphaneity, etc. ; 3, Chemical Composition and reactions, etc. ; 4, Geologi cal position ; 5, Localities and Mineral associates, etc. ; 6, Altered Forms. Under Structure are included, the system of crystallization, axial dimen sions, occurring forms and angles, cleavage, modes of composition, and semi crystalline aggregations. To avoid any ambiguity in the angles and prisms referred to in the follow ing pages, and render the subject intelligible to those who may not be famil iar with crystallographic language, a few explanations are here given in recapitulation of some of the principles more fully elucidated in the chapters on Crystallography. The annexed figure represents a rectangular prism with replaced edges and angles. 0 is the basal plane of the prism ; ii the larger lateral plane, parallel to the longer lateral axis ; ii the smaller lateral plane, parallel to the shorter lateral axis, a, b, c, are the axes, of which a is the vertical, b the shorter lateral or brachydiagonal, c the longer lateral or macrodiagonal. / are planes on the edges of the rectangular prism, which when ex tended would form a vertical rhombic prism, hav ing its axes b and c in the ratio of lb : lc. It is therefore the unit or fundamental vertical prism- li are planes parallel to the longer lateral axis, and having for the axes a, b, the ratio la: 16; extended upwards they form a dome, (so named from domus, a house), which is called the macrodome. The planes li in a similar manner form what is called a brachydome, they being parallel to the shorter lateral axis ; its axes a, c, have the ratio la : lc, that is, the two di agonals of this horizontal prism have this ratio- These two domes are there-"], [332, "4 mTEODUCTOKY REMARKS. fore the unit domes. The planes 1 on the eight angles are planes of an oc tahedron, having for the axes a, b, c, the ratio la :1b: lc. It is therefore the unit or fundamental octahedron, (1). Its pyramidal edges, if the octahe dron were completed, as in f. 13, would be of two kinds, two at each ex tremity opposite to the axis c, the longer lateral axis, and two opposite to b, the shorter lateral axis. The former is the macrodiagonal edge, the latter the brachydiagonal. By doubling the length of the vertical axis, the lateral being fixed, we form the octahedron 2 ; by trebling it the octahedron 3 ; by halving it the octahedron \\ ; and so for the domes, doubling the vertical axis we have the dome 2i or li ; by halving the same, the dome \\i or \\i, and so On. The letter t stands for infinity, and means that the plane is parallel to one of the axes ; i, that it is parallel to the longer lateral axis ; i, that it is parallel to the shorter lateral axis : i or I alone, or as the initial letter in a symbol, signifies that the plane is parallel to the vertical axis. A plane ii is parallel both to the vertical and longer lateral ; ii, both to the vertical and shorter lateral. The octahedrons alluded to above have for the axes b, c, the ratio 16 : lc, and belong to what is called the fundamental series. But others may exist with different ratios for 6 and c, and any value for a. If the ratio for b, c, is lb : 2c, then as b is the shorter lateral axis, if the vertical axis is lo, the octa hedron is 1 2 ; or if the vertical axis is 3a the plane is 32, or if \\a, it is So for the ratio 3b: lc; if the vertical axis is, lo, the octahedron is 1 3, or if 2a, it is 23 ; and if the vertical axis is infinite, the plane is parallel to the vertical axis, and the symbol is 13. The first figure or letter in these sym bols always refers to the vertical axis, and the second to one of the lateral axes. The planes may thus be viewed as lying in vertical zones, a different zone for every ratio of the lateral axes b : c. Each series, or zone, terminates above in the basal plane of the prism, for which a=0, and below in a vertical prism, for which a is infinite. The small tables inserted in connection with the crystalline forms of many of the species consist of the vertical zones of occurring planes. The planes of a vertical zone have mutual horizontal intersections in the crystal. Con sequently in a crystal not oblique the inclination of the basal plane, 0, on any plane in a zone, subtracted from 270\u00b0, gives the inclination of the prismatic plane of the same zone on that plane, and the tangents of the supplemental angles of 0 on the planes of a zone vary as the coefficient of the vertical axis for each plane. Thus, suppose there are the planes li, 2i, Si, take the supplement of 0 : li, (which, if 0 : li is 124\u00b0, equals 180\u00b0 \u2014 124\u00b0=56\u00b0); then the tangent of this angle, doubled, will be she tangent of the supple-"], [333, "mTEODUCTORT REMARKS. 5 ment of 0 : li, and trebled, of the supplement of the angle of 0 : 3i. The same for the planes 1, 2, 3, or I2, 2 2, 32; and so on. In these tables, the column of the fundamental series of octahedrons is distinguished from the oth^r columns by being enclosed by heavier lines. Reading across the tables, planes with the vertical axis equal, (that is, with the initial figure of the symbol the same), are in the same horizontal line ; and the planes in any one of these transverse lines between the fundamental column and the right-hand column have their mutual intersections parallel ; and so also with planes between it and the left. The horizontal line made up ofthe symbols of the vertical prisms is also enclosed by heavier lines. For fur ther elucidation of these tables, see page 58, etc., under Crystallography. In the Dimetric System, the lateral axes are equal, and there is no distinc tion of longer and shorter axis. The symbols li, li, apply to planes about the base of a square prism parallel to either lateral axis, as in figure 83, p. 40. In the Monoclinic System, the planes above the middle horizontal section in front differ from those below, on account of the obliquity of the crystal, and those of one set are -j-, and the other \u2014 . In the Rhombohedral section of the Hexagonal System, the planes 1, 2, 3, \\, etc. are planes of rhombohedrons, having for the vertical axis, la, 2a, 3a, \\a, etc., la being the value of the axis in the fundamental rhombohedron, (R). The angle of a Rhombohedron mentioned, is always that over a terminal edge, as that between the upper planes R of figure 26, p. 30. Qn gradually shortening the rhombohedron in figure 26, it may become %R, \u00a3 R, and so on, till the length becomes 0, and the rhombohedron is reduced to a flat plane. Hence starting from this plane, (which corresponds to the basal plane of the rhombohedron or hexagonal prism), the rhombohedron as it elongates reaches the form of figure 26 ; and continuing the elongation, the vertical axis doubles, \u2014 trebles, \u2014 and so on, till finally, it becomes infinite and the rhom bohedron is then a six-sided prism. If a diminution in length n ow com mences by planes inclined to the opposite extremities .of the vertical axis, these planes correspond to another series of rhombohedrons which are dis tinguished by a minus ( \u2014 ). The planes, 0 . . . . \\ . . 1 . . 2 . . . / (or co ) . . . . \u2014 2 . . \u2014 1 . . \u2014 i . . . . 0, lie in a single vertical zone ; and the same relation exists for the tangents of the supplemental angles of the inclination on 0, as is mentioned above. In the Hexagonal prism, the tables include one sixth of either extremity of the prism, commencing with, the fundamental series or zone, m .. I, and continuino* around 30 decrees to the intermediate series to2 . . ?2 ; the prism i2 truncates the lateral edges of prism /, as shown in figure 121."], [334, "INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 6 The above explanations may suffice to give a general idea of the system of notation used in this work and the principles on which it is based ; and they will subserve completely their end if they tempt the reader to study carefully the chapters on Crystallography, the difgculties iu which with most persons are more imaginary than real. The angles of the domes mentioned (in the descriptions of species) are the angles at top, unless otherwise stated. Those of the octahedral forms, are the angle at the macrodiagonal edge, as the angle 1 : 1 in the preceding figure over It, (indicated by the syllable mac) ; that at the brachydiagonal edge, or 1 : 1 over li, (brack.) ; that at the basal edge or 1 : 1 over the base, (bas.) Those of the vertical prism, may similarly be either the macrodiago nal (over ii) or oracAydiagonal, (over ii). The angles of Monometric forms are mentioned in a table on pages 70, 71. The dimensions of the axes given in the following pages are those that correspond to the values of the angles mentioned in the same line of the text. But in very many species, these angles admit of variations from change of temperature, and often still wider variations from other causes. They are therefore to be regarded only as approximations, or the best mean results that have been arrived at. In the classification of the mineral species here adopted, the grand subdi visions are as follows : I. Native Elements. II. Combinations with Elements of the Sulphur and Arsenic Sections. 1.

The Chilian gold afforded Domeyko 84 to 96 per cent, of gold and 15 to 3 per cent, of silver, (Ann. d. Mines, [4], vi). Copper is occasionally alloyed with gold, and also palladium and rhodium. A Brazilian specimen of Palladium gold (Porpezite) from a place called Porpez, af- forded Berzelius, Gold 85*98, palladium 95*8, silver 4*17. Gold amalgam has been reported from California, especially near Mariposa. Rhodium gold has the specific gravity 15*5 \u2014 16*8. It is brittle, and contains, according to Del Rio, 34 to 43 per cent, of rhodium. The mineral nagyagite con- tains 8 to 9 per cent, of gold. Native gold is largely obtained from alluvial washings. It is also found dissemi- nated in certain rocks, especially the quartz veins that intersect talcose, mica, and argillaceous schists. It is sometimes found also in gneiss, granite, and porphyry. It is often contained in pyrites, constituting the auriferous pyrites. The detritus af- fording gold dust has proceeded from some gold-bearing-rocks. Gold is widely distributed over the globe. It occurs in Brazil, (where formerly a greater part of that used was obtained), along the chain of mountains which runs nearly parallel with the coast, especially near Villa Rica, and in the province of Minas Geraes ; in New Grenada at Antioquia, Choco, and Giron ; in Chili ; spar- ingly in Peru ; in Mexico ; in New Mexico, near Santa Fe, Cerillos, Avo ; in Guate- mala, and near Panama; in the Rocky Mountains, near the Great Salt Lake; in California, between the Sierra Nevada and the Sacramento and San Joaquim ; in the southern of the United States. In Europe it is most abundant in Hungary at Konigsberg, Schemnitz, and Felsobanya, and in Transylvania at Kapnik, Vorospa- tak, and Offenbanya ; it occurs also in the sands of the Rhine, the Reuss, and the Aar ; \"on the southern slope of the Pennine Alps from the Simplon and Monte Rosa to the valley of Aosta ; in Piedmont ; in Spain, formerly worked in Asturias ; in many of the streams of Cornwall ; near Dolgelly and other parts of North Wales ; in Scotland, in considerable amount, near Leadhills, and in Glen Coich and other parts of Perthshire; in the county of Wicklow, Ireland; in Sweden, at Edelfors. 2"], [338, "10 descriptive mineralogy. In the Urals are valuable mines at Beresof, and other places on the eastern or Asiatic flank of this range, and the comparatively level portions of Siberia; also in the Altai mountains. Also in the Cailas mountains in Little Thibet. There are mines in Africa, at Kordofan, between Darfour and Abyssinia; also south of Sahara in the western part of Africa, from the Senegal to Cape Palmas ; also in the interior on the Somat, a day's journey from Cassen ; also along the coast opposite Madagascar, between 22 and*35 degrees south latitude, supposed to have been the Ophir ofthe time of Solomon. Other regions are China, Japan, Formosa, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, western coast of Borneo, and the Philippines. The gold of commerce comes mostly from Asiatic Russia, Australia, Brazil, Bohe mia, Transylvania, Africa, the East India Islands, California, and the southeastern parts of the United States. The Russian mines, until the discovery of the mines of California and Australia, were the most productive in the world. They are principally alluvial washings, and these washings seldom yield less than 65 grains of gold for 4000 pounds of soil ; never more than 120 grains. The alluvium is generally most productive where the loose material is most ferruginous. The mines of Katherinenburg are in the parent rock \u2014 a quartz constituting grains in a half decomposed granite called \" bercsite,\" which is connected with taleose and chloritic schists. The shafts are sunk verti cally in the beresite, seldom below 25 feet, and from them lateral galleries are run to the veins. These mines afforded between the years 1725 and 1841, 679 poods of gold, or about 30,000 pounds tro}'. The whole of the Russian mines yielded in 1842, 970 poods of gold, or 42,000 pounds troy, half of which was from Siberia, east of the Urals. In 1843, the yield was nearly 60,000 pounds troy, or about $13,000,000; in 1845, it amounted to $13,250,000 ; and in 1846, to 1722*74*6 poods, equal to 75,353 troy pounds, and $16,500,000; in 1851, $15,000,000. Fig. 263 is by G. Rose from a Ural crystal. At the Transylvania mines of Vorospatak, the gold is obtained by mining, and these mines have been worked, since che time of the Romans. The annual yield of Europe, exclusive of Russia, is not above $1,000,000. Austria afforded in 1844, 6785 marks. The sands of the Rhone, Rhine, and Danube, con tain gold in small quantities. The Rhine has been most productive between Bale andManheim; but at present only $9000 are extracted annually. The sands ofthe richest quality contain only about 56 parts of gold in a hundred millions; sands containing less than half this proportion are worked. The whole amount of gold in the auriferous sands of the Rhine is estimated at $30,000,000, but it is mostly covered by soil under cultivation. Africa yields annually at least 4500 pounds troy, ($850,000), and Southern Africa, 1250 pounds, ($235,000). The mines of South America and Mexico were estimated by Humboldt to yield an nually about $11,500,000; but the amount has much diminished. Brazil of late has furnished about 17,500 pounds troy. It is estimated that between 1790 and 1830, Mexico produced $31,250,000 in gold, Chili $13,450,000, and Buenos Ayres $19,500, 000, making an average annual yield of $i6,050,000. The mines of Australia yield 60 or 80 millions of dollars a year. They are situ ated mostly in southeastern Australia, especially about Mt. Alexander, in lat. 37\u00b0 S., long. 144\u00b0 20' E ; the valleys of Forest Creek and Fryer's Creek are most productive. The mines ofthe Southern United States have produced till recently about a million of dollars a year. They are mostly confined to the States of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, or along a line from the Rappahannock to the Coosa in Ala bama. But the region may be said to extend north to Canada ; for gold has been found at Albion and Madrid in Maine, Canaan, N. H., Bridgewater, Vermont, Ded ham, Mass., and on the Chaudiere river, and elsewhere in Canada. Traces occur also in Franconia township, Montgomery Co., Pennsylvania. In Virginia, the principal deposits are in Spotsylvania county, on the Rappahan nock, at the United States mines, and at other places to the southwest ; in Stafford county, at the Rappahannock gold mines, ten miles from Falmouth, in the Culpepper county, at Culpepper mines, on Rapidan river ; in Orange county, at the Orange Grove gold mine, and at the Greenwood gold mines; in Goochland county, at Moss and Busby's mines; in Louisa county, at Walton's gold mine; in Buckingham county, at Eldridge's mine. In North Carolina, the gold region is mostly confined to the three ranges of counties between Frederick and Charlotte, which are situated about in a line running northeast and southwest, parallel nearly with the coast."], [339, "GOLD, 11 The mines of Mecklenburg are principally vein deposits; those of Burke, Lincoln, and Rutherford, are mostly in alluvial soil. The Davidson county silver mine had afforded $7000 of gold in 1844. In Georgia, the Shelton gold mines in Habersham county have long been famous ; and many other places have been opened in Rabun and Hall counties, and the Cherokee country. In South Carolina, the principal gold regions are the Fairforest in Union district, and the Lynch's creek and Catawba regions, chiefly in Lancaster and Chesterfield districts ; also in Picken's county, ad joining Georgia. There is gold also in eastern Tennessee. In Canada, it occurs at St. Francois Beauce, Aubert, Gallion, Sherbrooke, Melbourne, etc., with some platinum and iridosmine. Viewing the gold region of the Eastern United States as a whole, it is perceived that it ranges along the Appalachians, particularly the eastern slope, from Maine to Alabama, having nearly a northeast and southwest course. Gold also occurs in Arkansas, Texas, and the Rocky Mountains. The California mines are mostly .alluvial. They yield 50 millions of dollars an nually. The gold is found in the gravel and sand of the valleys, and beds of streams leading from the Sierra Nevada into the adjoining valley of the Sacramento and San Joachim. Pebbles of quartz abound over the region, and magnetic iron sand is also abundant. All the tributaries of these rivers have their auriferous sands, and the dry valleys and gorges, (runs of water only in the wet season), also yield it abundantly. In the higher country, or along the dry ravines, the gold is in larger pieces, or grains, and occasionally cavities in the surface of the subjacent rocks, (called pockets), are laid open, which .afford large quantities of the metal. Lower down the streams, the gold is in finer grains, usually flattened scales, a form which partly results from the condition in lamin\u00e6 in the original rock, and partly from the trituration the grains are subjected to among the gravel under the action of running water; for as in other regions of alluvial gold, the auriferous earth, or gravel, has resulted from the wear of auriferous rocks, and water has been some way concerned in producing, transporting, and distributing it. The gold being specifically four or five times heavier than ordinary pebbles, it settles high up the streams, and only the small particles are carried far below. The scales have been observed by Mr. J. E. Tesehemacher to be sometimes hexagonal plates. Zircons have been observed in the auriferous sands, and also platinum; diamonds have been re ported. Fig. 262 represents a crystal of gold of natural size, as published by F. Alger. C. U. Shepard describes another crystal from California which is a pentagonal dode cahedron two fifths of an inch in diameter. The color of the grains varies from a pale to a deep yellow, the shade depending mainly on the proportion of silver present ; there is generally great uniformity in the appearance of the grains of the same locality, The gold rock of the United States is to a great extent a micaceous or taleose schist, with veins or beds of quartz. The gold is mostly confined to these veins, though also found to some extent in the rock either side. The schist is often half decomposed or rusted. The quartz is usually more or less cellular, or wanting in perfect compactness, and sometimes tabular ; yet it is at times quite solid. Iron pyrites is frequently present, and by decomposition it stains the rock with iron rust. Other minerals often associated with the gold, are copper pyrites, blende, galena, anglesite, zircons, sulphur, (in minute crystals, proceeding from the decom position of pyrites). Heavy spar is sometimes a large constituent of the vein, and fluor spar is now and then present. The peculiar appearance of the quartz, some what cellular, more or less rusted, and its position in veins, through an imperfect 6hale, and generally not firmly attached to the enclosing walls, afford the best indi cations of the presence of gold, though the absence of all these conditions is not evidence that no gold is to be found. The grains of gold may sometimes be seen in the cavities of the quartz, or it sparkles on a surface of fracture. But very com monly a mass of quartz that shows nothing to the eye, yields gold on trial. The same kinds of rock and veins of quartz were observed by the author in 1842 near the Umpqua river, Southern Oregon, and pebbles from similar rocks were met with along the Sacramento ; and the resemblance to other gold districts was re marked at the time ; but there was no opportunity for exploring the country where gold has since been found. Masses of gold of considerable size have been found in North Carolina. The largest was discovered in Cabarras Co. ; it weighed twent3*-eight pounds avoirdu pois, (\" steel-yard weight,\" equals 37 lbs. troy), and was 8 or 9 inches long by 4 or"], [340, "12 DESCRIPTIVE MINERaiLOGY. 5 broad, and about an inch thick. The largest mass yet reported from California weighed 20 pounds. In Paraguay, pieces from 1 to 50 pounds weight were taken from a mass of rock which fell from one of the highest mountains. Several speci mens weighing 16 pounds have been found in the Ural, and one of 27 pounds; and in the valley of Taschku Targanka, in 1842, a mass was detached, weighing very nearly 100 pounds troy. This mass is now in the Museum of Mining Engineers at St. Petersburgh. A mass found recently in Australia had the enormous weight of 134 lbs. 7 oz., and afforded 109 lbs. 11 oz. of fine gold ; it sold for \u00a35,532. Another of 27 lbs. 6 oz. 15 dwts. was obtained at Forest Creek, South Australia. An examination of a gold rock for gold is a simple process. The rock is first pounded up fine and sifted; a certain quantity ofthe sand thus obtained is washed in a shallow iron pan, and as the gold sinks, the material above is allowed to pass off into some receptacle. The largest part of the gold is thus left in the angle of the pan; by another similar process a further portion is obtained; and when the bulk of sand is thus reduced to a manageable quantity, the gold is amalgamated with clean mercury ; the amalgam is next strained to separate any excess of mer cury, and finally is heated and the mercury expelled, leaving the gold. In this way, by successive trials with the rock, the proportion of gold is quite accurately ascer tained. It is the same process used with the larger washings, though on a small scale. Mercury unites readily with gold, and thus separates it from any associated rock or sand ; and it is employed in all extensive gold washings, though much gold may be often obtained by simple washing without amalgamation. The operation of hand washing is called in Virginia panning. With a small iron pan, they wash the earth in a tub or in some brook, and thus extract much gold from the gravel or soil, which is said to pan well or pan poorly, according to the result. Masses of quartz, with no external indication of gold, examined in the above way at a Virginia mine, afforded an average of more than eight dollars to the bushel of gold rock. When gold is alloyed with copper or silver, the mode of assay for separating the copper depends on the process of cupellation ; and that for separating the silver, on the power of nitric acid to dissolve silver without acting on gold. (See chapter on chemical reactions). The uses of gold are well known ; and also that it owes a great part of its value to its extreme malleability, and the fact of its not tarnishing on exposure. Although a costly metal, it is one of the cheapest means of ornament, on account of the thin ness of the leaves into which it may be beaten. A grain of the metal may be made to cover 56f square inches of surface, and the thinnest leaf is but 1,280,000th of an inch thick. Perfectly pure gold is denominated gold of 24 carats, or fine gold. If it contains 22 parts of pure gold to 2 of silver, or 1 of copper and 1 of silver, it is said to be 22 carats fine ; so also for 20 carats fine, it contains 20 parts of pure gold. The carat is divided into -j, -g , -j-g, 3-5- parts, for a more minute specification of the quan tity of gold. The standard of gold of the United States consists of 900 parts of gold to 100 of an alloy of copper and silver. The eagle (10 dollars) contains 232 grains of fine gold. PLATINUM.

B.B. infusible. Soluble only in heated nitro-muriatic acid. Acts slightly on the magnet ; but this property depends on the amount of iron it contains. Platinum was first found in pebbles and small grains, associated with iridium, rhodium, osmium, palladium, gold, copper, and chrome, in the alluvial deposits of Brazil, Choeo, and Barbacoa, in South America, where it received its name, platina, irom. plata, silver, of which word platina is a diminutive. Occurs at Nischne Ta gilsk, and Goroblagodat, in the Ural, here, (as elsewhere), in alluvial or drift mate rial ; the gravel has been traced to a great extent up Mount La Martiane, which consists of crystalline rocks. It has been formed into coins of eleven and twenty-two rubles each, by the Russians, which are not a legal tender, but pass conventionally, and principally in the southern provinces of the empire. Russia affords annually about 800 cwt. of platinum, which is nearly ten times the amount from Brazil, Columbia, St. Domingo, and Borneo. The amount coined from 1826 to 1844, equaled 2\u00a3 mill ions of dollars. Platinum is also found on Borneo; in the sands of the Rhine; at St. Aray, val du Drac; county of Wicklow, Ireland; on the river Jocky, St. Do mingo ; in the California gold region ; in traces with gold in Rutherford Co., North Carolina; at St. Francois Beauce, etc., Canada East. Borneo affords 600 to 800 pounds per year. Although platinum generally occurs in quite small grains, masses are sometimes found of considerable magnitude. A mass, weighing 1088 grains, was brought by Humboldt from South America, and deposited in the Berlin museum ; specific gravity 18*94. In 1822 a mass from Condoto was deposited in the Madrid museum, measur ing two inches and four lines in diameter, and weighing 11,641 grains. A specimen was found in the year 1827, in the Ural, not far from the Demidoff mines, which weighed 10 -j-g- Russian pounds, or 11-57 pounds troy, and similar masses are not uncommon ; the largest yet seen weighed 21 pounds troy, and is in the Demidoff cabinet. The infusibility of this metal, and its property of resisting the action of the air and moisture, and nearly all chemical agents, render it highly valuable for the con struction of philosophical and chemical apparatus ; for vessels for the concentration of sulphuric acid ; for crucibles and capsules in chemical analysis ; for covering other metals, and for painting on porcelain. It may be drawn into wire of extreme tenuity ; Dr. Wollaston succeeded in obtaining a wire not exceeding the two thou sandth of an inch in diameter. The metal platinum was first discovered by Ulloa, a Spanish traveler in America, in the year 1735. This metal fuses readily before the \" compound blowpipe;\" and Dr. Hare suc ceeded in 1837 in melting twenty-eight ounces into one mass. The metal was almost as malleable and as good for working as that obtained by the other process ; it had a specific gravity of 19*8. He afterwards succeeded in obtaining from the ore masses which were 90 per cent, platinum, and as malleable as the metal in ordinary use, though somewhat more liable to tarnish, owing to some of its impurities.

Composition. \u2014 Palladium, alloyed with a little platinum and iridium. Infusible alone before the blowpipe, but fuses readily with sulphur. By continuing the heat, the sulphur is driven off, and a globule of palladium obtained. Palladium occurs with platinum, in Brazil. Quite large masses of the metal are brought from that country. It is extracted from the auriferous sands by first fusing it with silver, and consequently forming a quaternary alloy of gold, palla dium, silver, and copper, which is granulated by projecting it into water. By means of nitric acid all but the gold is dissolved ; and from the solution, the silver is first precipitated by common salt as an insoluble chlorid, and then, after separating the chlorid, the palladium and copper are precipitated by plates of zinc. This precipi tate is redissolved in nitric acid, an excess of ammonia added, and then hydrochlo ric acid sufficient to saturate; a double chlorid of palladium and ammonium is de posited as a crystalline yellow powder, which on calcination produces spongy palladium. The metal is malleable and when polished has a splendid steel-like lustre, which does not tarnish. A cup weighing 3 J pounds was made by M. Breant for the mint of Paris, and is now in the garde-meuble of the French government. One part fused with six of gold forms a white alloy ; and this compound was em ployed at the suggestion of Dr. Wollaston, for the graduated part of the mural circle, constructed by Troughton for the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. It has been employed for balances and mathematical and surgical instruments. A brown oehreous substance associated with the Palladium Gold of Brazil, has been considered a Palladium Ochre or oxyd. It is soluble in muriatic acid. Detected by Johnson and Lampadius, (J. f. pr. Chem. xi, 309). Hexagonal Palladium. \u2014 The native palladium also occurs in small hexagonal ta bles, with perfect lateral cleavage : Color pale steel-gray ; lustre bright. Occurs at Tilkerode.

Mercury in the metallic state is a rare mineral; the quicksilver of commerce is mostly obtained from cinnabar, one of its ores. Its most important mines are those of Idria in Carniola, and Almaden in Spain. At Idria it occurs interspersed through a kind of elay 6late, from which it is obtained by washing. It is found in small quantities at Wolfstein and Mbrsfeld, in the Palatinate, in Carinthia, Hungary, Peru, and other countries ; also at Peyrat le Chateau, in the department of the Haute Vienne, in a disintegrated granite, unaccompanied by cinnabar ; in California."], [343, "SILVER. 15 AMALGAM.

The Kongsberg native silver contains some per cent, of mercury, which accounts for its whiteness, and perhaps for its fine crys tallization, (S\u00e6mann). B.B. fuses rather easily, and often crystallizes on cooling. Soluble in nitric acid, and again deposited by a plate of copper. Native silver occurs in masses or in aborescences and filiform shapes, in veins of calcareous spar or quartz, traversing gneiss, slate, and other ancient rocks. The filiform varieties are often composed of one or more series of octahedrons, either closely united or arranged linearly in straight rows. This structure is apparent in most of the Norwegian and Mexican varieties. The mines of Kongsberg in Norway, have afforded magnificent specimens of native silver. One specimen among the splendid suite from this locality in the royal collection at Copenhagen, weighs upwards of 5 cwt., and recently two masses have been obtained weighing severally 238 and 436 pounds. The principal Saxon localities are at Freiberg, Schneeberg, and Jobanngeorgenstadt ; the Bohemian, at Przibram, and Joaehimstahl. It also occurs in small quantities with other ores, at Andreasberg, in the Hartz, in Su.abia, Hungary, at Allemont in Dauphiny, in the Ural near Beresof, in the Altai at Schlangenberg, and in some of the Cornish mines. Mexico and Peru are at present the most productive countries in silver. In Mex ico it has been obtained mostly from its ores, while in Peru it occurs principally native. A Mexican specimen from Batopilas weighed when obtained 400 pounds; and one from Southern Peru, (mines of Huantaya), weighed over 8 cwt. During the first eighteen years of the present century, more than 8,180,000 marks of silver were afforded by the mines of Guanaxuato alone. In the United States it is disseminated through much of the copper of Michigan, occasionally in spots of some size, and sometimes in cubes, according to J. D. Whitney, at Copper Falls Mine. It has been observed at a mine a mile south of Sing Sing prison, which was formerly worked for silver ; at the Bridgewater copper mines, New Jersey ; in interesting specimens at King's mine, Davidson Co., N. C. ; at Prince's location, Lake Superior, Canada. Altered Forms. \u2014 Pseudomorphs, consisting of horn silver and silver glance.

Dissolves readily in nitric acid, with the extrication of the red fumes of nitrous acid, and produces a blue solution with ammonia. Copper occurs in beds and veins accompanying its various ores, and sometimes associated with iron. It is frequently found in loose masses imbedded in the soil. In Siberia, and the island of Nalsoe, in Faroe, it is associated with mesotype, in amygdaloid, and though mostly disseminated in minute particles, sometimes branches through the rock with extreme beauty. Common in Cornwall, at manv ofthe mines near Redruth ; and also in considerable quantities at the Consolidated mines, Wheal Buller, and others. Brazil, Chili, and Peru afford native copper ; a mass now in the museum at Lisbon, supposed to be from a valley near Bahia, weighs 2616 pounds. This metal has been found native throughout the red sandstone region of the eastern United States, particularly in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and more abun dantly in New Jersey, where it has been met with sometimes in fine crystalline masses, especially at Brunswick, Somerville, Schuyler's mines, and Flemington. One mass from near Somerville, on the premises of J. C. Van Dyke, Esq., of Brunswick, weighed 78 pounds, and is said originally to have weighed 128. Near Brunswick a vein or sheet of copper, a line or so thick, has been traced for several rods. Near New Haven, Conn., a mass was formerly found weighing 90 pounds. No known locality exceeds in the abundance of native copper, the Lake Superior copper region, near Kewenaw Point, where it exists in veins that intersect the trap and sandstone. Masses of great size were observed in this district near the Ontanagon river, by Mr. Schoolcraft, in 1821. A large mass was thrown down in the Lake Superior region, July 8th, 1853, at the North American mine ; it was about 40 feet long, and its estimated weight was 200 tons. This copper con tains intimately mixed with it about T3^ per cent, of silver ; often this metal is in visible grains, lumps, or strings, and occasionally a mass of copper when polished, appears sprinkled with large silver spots, resembling, as Dr. Jackson observes, a porphyry with its feldspar crystals. The copper occurs in trap or sandstone, near the junction of these two rocks, and has probably been produced through the re duction of copper ores. Strings of copper often reticulate through crystals of anal cime and prehnite. The copper of Chili also contains silver, and sometimes 7 to 8 per cent. NATIVE LEAD. Plomb Natif, H. Gediegen Blei, W.

Sci. xii, 154, and [2], v, 292), where it is said to have been found in a vein or plate, two inches thick, attached to a mass of miea-slate rock. It con tained graphite in the broad lamin\u00e6 into which it was divided; and it had no ob vious crystalline structure, nor was any developed by etching with nitric acid, as in most meteoric irons. Foreign specimens are also reported to have been found. Cramer describes one weighing four pounds, obtained in the mine of Hackenburg. It is said to have been observed in thin lamin\u00e6 in an iron stone conglomerate in Brazil and in lava in Au vergne; also in the keuper in Thuringia, in an argillaceous sandstone, containing fossils. It afforded but a trace of nickel : G. =5*24, (Pogg. lxxxviii, 1853, 145, where other localities are mentioned).* The presence of metallic iron in grains in basaltic rocks (from Giant's Causeway, etc.,) has been announced by Dr. Andrews. After pulverizing the rock and sepa rating by means of a magnet the grains that were attracted by it, he subjected the grains to the action of an acid solution of sulphate of copper in the field of a mi croscope, which salt, when there is a trace of pure iron present, gives a deposit of copper ; and in his trials there were occasional deposits of copper in crystalline bunches. Meteoric iron usually contains 1 to 20 per cent, of nickel, besides a small per cent age of other metals, as cobalt, manganese, tin, copper, chromium; also phosphorus common as a phosphuret, sulphur in sulphurets, carbon in some instances, chlorine.

The crystalline struc ture of this iron is very remarkable as developed by nitric acid on a polished sur face. Silliman has observed that the nickel is segregated along the lines of crystallization, and that it is not uniformly alloyed with the iron, as had been previ ously supposed, (communicated to the author). It was brought from Red river. Still more remarkable masses exist in South America ; one was discovered by Don Rubin de Celis in the district of Chaco-Gualamba, whose weight was estimated at 30,000 lbs., and another was found at Bahia in Brazil, whose solid contents are at least twenty-eight cubic feet, and weight 14,000 lbs. The Siberian meteorite, dis covered by Pallas, weighed originally 1600 lbs. and contained imbedded crystals of chrysolite. Smaller masses are quite common. Meteoric iron is perfectly malleable, and may be readily worked into cutting instruments, and put to the same uses as manufactured iron. M. Bahr has observed grains of native iron in a fragment of petrified wood. The iron was mixed with limonite and organic matter, and is supposed to have been produced by the deoxydation of a salt of iron by the organic matter of the wood. He calls the iron Sideroferrite.

The Newjanskite is not decomposed and does not give an osmium odor. With nitre, the characteristic odor of osmium is soon perceived, and a mass obtained soluble in water, from which a green precipitate is thrown down by nitric acid. It occurs with platinum in the province of Choco in South America, and in the Ural mountains. It was first distinguished by Dr. Wollaston, who discovered that the specimens were an alloy of iridium and osmium.

Native arsenic commonly occurs in veins in crystalline rocks and the older schists, and is often accompanied by ores of antimony, red silver ore, realgar, blende, and other metallic minerals. The silver mines of Freiberg, Annaberg, Marienberg, and Schneeberg, afford this metal in considerable quantities ; also Joachimstahl in Bohemia, Andreasberg in the Hartz, Kapnik in Transylvania, Orawitza in the Bannat, Kongsberg in Norway, Zimeoff in Siberia, in large masses, and St. Maria aux Mines in Alsace. In the United States it has been observed by Jackson at Haverhill, N. H., on the estate of Mr. Francis Kimball, in thin layers in dark-blue mica slate, stained by plumbago, and containing also white and magnetic pyrites; also at Jackson, N. H. The name Arsenic is derived from the Greek appcpucov or apccvinov, masculine, a term applied to orpiment or sulphuret of arsenic, on account of its potent proper ties.

Composition. \u2014 Pure sulphur, but often contaminated with clay or bitumen ; burns with a bluish flame at a low temperature, with the strong odor of sulphurous acid ; becomes resinously electrified by friction ; is insoluble in water, and not acted on by the acids. Sulphur is dimorphous, the crystals being obtuse oblique rhombic prisms, of 90\u00b0 32', and inclination of the vertical axis=95\u00b0 46', when formed at a moderately high temperature, (125 C, according to Frankenheim). The great repositories of sulphur are either beds of gypsum and the associate rocks, or the regions of active and extinct volcanoes. In the valley ofNoto and Mazzaro in Sicily, at Conil near Cadiz in Spain, Bex in Switzerland, and Cracow in Poland, it occurs in the former situation. Sicily, and the neighboring volcanic isles, the Solfatara near Naples, the volcanoes ofthe Pacific ocean, <fec, are localities of the latter kind. The crystals from Sicily are sometimes two or three inches in diameter. It is also deposited from hot springs in Iceland ; and in Savoy, Swit zerland, Hanover, and other countries, it is met with in certain metallic veins ; near Cracow and in Upper Egypt there are large deposits. A fibrous variety is found near Siena in Tuscany. Sulphur is found near tbe sulphur springs of New York, Virginia, <fec, and also in coal deposits and elsewhere, where sulphuret of iron is undergoing decompo sition ; also in microscopic crystals at some of the gold mines of Virginia and North Carolina ; and as a powder in the Western lead regions in fissures in the limestone. It occurs in small masses in limestone on the Potomac, twenty-five miles above Washington. The sulphur mines of Sicily, the crater of Vulcano, and the Solfatara near Naples, afford immense quantities of sulphur for commerce. It is also largely obtained in roasting the sulphurets of iron and copper. This species is hom\u0153omorphous with Barytes and Marcasite if \u00a71 be taken as the unit macrodome.

Transparent ; trans lucent when dark colored. Fracture conchoidal. Composition. \u2014 The diamond is pure carbon crystallized. It burns, and is wholly consumed at a temperature of 14\u00b0 Wedgewood, producing carbonic acid gas. It is not acted on by acids or alkalies. Exhibits vitreous electricity when rubbed. Index of refraction 2'439. The refraction of light by the diamond is often irreg ular, probably arising from the cause which has produced the convex forms. In some plates from crystals, Deseloiseaux has observed a fixed star of six symmetrical rays, and in others, allied in character, the rays were replaced by three large elliptical areas. Deseloiseaux shows that the rays are symmetrical with reference to the faces of the octahedron, and supposes them to be due to foreign matter. The diamond appears generally to occur in regions that afford a laminated granular quartz rock, called itacolumite, which pertains to the taleose series, and owes its lamination to a little talc or mica. This rock is found at the mines of Brazil and the Urals ; and also in Georgia and North Carolina, where a few diamonds have been found. It has also been detected in a species of conglomerate, composed of rounded siliceous pebbles, quartz, chalcedony, <fec, cemented by a kind of ferru ginous clay. Diamonds are usually, however, washed out from the soil. According to M. Denis (Ann. des M. [3], xix, 602) the diamond in Minas Geraes, Brazil, is found"], [353, "25 DUMOND. in two different deposits ; one called gurgulho, consisting of broken quartz, and covered by a thin bed of sand or earth ; the other, cascalho, of rolled quartz pebbles, united by a ferruginous clay, resting usually on taleose clays, the whole, the debris from taleose rocks. The first deposit affords the finest diamonds, and both contain also gold, platinum, magnetic iron, rutile, <fec. The most celebrated mines are on the rivers Jequitinhonha and Pardo, north of Rio Janeiro, where the sands (the waters being turned off) are washed by slaves. It has lately been found in Bahia, on the river Cachoeira, at the mines of Surua and Sincora ; and Damour has recog nized in the sand of the locality, quartz, feldspar, rutile, brookite, anatase, zircon crystals, diaspore, magnetic iron, gold in grains, anhydrous phosphate of alumina and lime, a silicate of yttria, and a hydro-phosphate of yttria. At Bagagem, Minas Geraes, an enormous diamond of 247 1 carats has recently been found. The Ural diamonds occur in the detritus along the Adolfskoi rivulet, where worked for gold, and also at other places. In India, the diamond is met with at Purteal, between Hyderabad and Masuli patam, where the famous Kohinoor was found ; but there are now only two places of exploration, and these are let to some of the natives for less than 25 francs a year ; and if the hands find a stone worth four or five rupees ($2 to $2\u00a3) a month, they consider themselves fortunate. To such a state are the famous mines of Golconda now reduced. Found also near Parma in Bundelcund, where some of the most magnificent specimens have been found ; also on the Mahanuddy near Ellore. The locality on Borneo is at Pontiana, on the west side of the Ratoos mountain. The river Gunil, in the province of Constantine in Africa, is reported to have afforded some diamonds. In the United States, a few crystals have been met with in Rutherford Co., N. C, and Hall Co., Ga. (Am. J. S. [2], ii, 253, and xv); in Australia, on the banks of the Turon. The diamond has been found massive in Brazil, in small black pebbles, having the specific gravity 3*012 \u2014 3*416. They proved on trial to be pure carbon excepting 2*07 to 0*27 per cent. This compact diamond is sold in the region at 75 cents the carat of three and one-sixth grains troy. The largest diamond of which we have any knowledge is mentioned by Tavernier, as in possession of the Great Mogul. It weighed originally 900 carats, or 2769*3 grains, but was reduced by cutting to 861 grains. It has the form and size of half a hen's egg. It was found in 1550 in the mine of Colone. The Pitt or Regent diamond weighs but 136*25 carats, or 419J grains; but is of unblemished trans parency and color. It is cut in the form of a brilliant, and is estimated at \u00a3125,000. The Kohinoor measured on its arrival in England about If inches in its greater diameter, over f of an inch in thiekness, and weighed 186-L- carats. It has since been recut and reduced to a diameter of 1-2- by If nearly ; and thus diminished over one-third in its weight. It is supposed by Mr. Tennant to have been originally a dodecahedron, and he suggests that the great Russian diamond and another large Blab weighing 130 carats were actually cut from the original dodecahedron. Tavernier gives the original weight at 787-J carats. The Rajah of Mattan has in his possession a diamond from Borneo, weighing 367 carats. The mines of Brazil were not known to afford diamonds, till the commencement of the 18th century. Maure mentions one crystal from these mines of 120 carats, but they rarely exceed 18 or 20. Colorless diamonds are most highly esteemed. When cut and polished, a dia mond ofthe purest water in England, weighing one carat, is valued at \u00a38; and the value of others is calculated by multiplying the square of the weight in carats by 8. except for those exceeding 20 carats, the value of which increases at a much more rapid rate. This rule is scarcely regarded in market, as the standard of purity and taste for different countries differs, and the slightest tinge of color affects greatly the commercial value. The method of polishing diamonds was discovered in 1456, by Louis Berquen, a citizen of Bruges, previous to which time, the diamond was known \"only in its un cut state. The diamond is valuable for the purposes of engraving and cutting glass, and the curvature of the crystalline faces much improves it for this purpose. It is also used in powder for polishing and cutting other gems, and in splinters for drilling. It has been used for lenses for microscopes, on account of its slight chromatic aber ration, and the large field it consequently affords ; but the crystals often have an 4"], [354, "26 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY.. irregularity of internal structure, even when clear, which unfits them for this purpose. The diamond is supposed to be of vegetable origin. It has probably proceeded from the slow decomposition of some vegetable material or bituminous matter. Black specks, like charcoal, have been observed in some crystals : but this proves nothing necessarily respecting their origin, since this is the form which carbon un crystallized assumes, whatever its source.

The anthracites of Pennsylvania contain 85 to 92 per cent, of carbon ; those of South Wales, 88 to 95 ; of France, 80 to 83 ; of Saxony, 81 ; of Russia, sometimes 94 per cent. Anthracites differ much in hardness and readiness of combustion. The softer are called free-burning coals, and contain a trace of bitumen. Fossil Coak. \u2014 More compact than artificial coak, and some varieties contain con siderable bitumen. From the Edgehill mines near Richmond, Va., according to Genth, who attributes its origin to the action of a trap eruption on bituminous coal. II. Bituminous Coal. \u2014 The proportion of' bitumen is indefinite, varying from 10 to 60 per cent., and the coal is said to be Dry or Fat, according to the amount of bitumen. The coal is softer than anthracite, less highly lustrous, of a more purely black or brownish -black color, and the specific gravity varies between 1*14 and 1*5 ; 1*26 \u2014 1*37, Pennsylvania; 1*27, Newcastle, England; 1*199, Lancashire cannel; 1*27\u20141*32, Scotland; 1*2\u2014 1*33, France; 1*27\u2014 1.*3, Belgium; Albert coal, Hillsboro, 1*129; Jet coal, Grayson Co., Ky., 1*166; ib. Breckenridge Co., Ky., 1*14\u20141*16. Of bituminous coal, there are several varieties. Pitch or caking coal, when heated, breaks into small pieces, which, on raising the heat, unite in a solid mass. Its color is velvet black, or grayish-black. Specific gravity, 1*269. It burns readily, with a yellow flame, but requires frequent stir ring to prevent its caking, by which the ingress of air for combustion is prevented. Cherry coal resembles caking coal, but does not soften and cake, when heated. It is very frangible, and hence, in mining it, there is considerable waste. Near Birmingham, the loss in mining, including the pillars, amounts to two-thirds of the whole. It burns more rapidly than caking coal, with a clear yellow flamei Splint coal is a dry coal, harder than the cherry coal ; it is a 'coarse kind of can nel coal. There are other varieties which are still less bituminous ; the flint coal of En-"], [355, "MINERAL COAL. 27 gland is of this kind, and approaches anthracite ; the flew coal of Wedgebury in Staffordshire is ot a similar nature ; and the crow coal of Cumberland at Alston Moor is almost without bitumen. Cannel coal has a dark grayish-black or brownish-black color, a fine compact tex ture, a large conchoidal fracture, and receives a good polish. It burns readily, without melting, with a clear yellow flame, and it has been used as a substitute for candles, whence its name. It abounds at Lesmahago, about twenty miles from Glas gow, also in different parts of Ayrshire, where it is made into inkstands, snuff-boxes, and other similar articles. The .Albert coal of Nova Scotia has the appearance of asphaltum, and is partially soluble, (about 20 per cent.), but it has not the fusibility of asphaltum. It is the melanasphalt of Wetherill. The Jet Coal of Breckenridge and Grayson Cos., Ken tucky, is like jet in compactness and beauty, and is worked with tools like Cannel Coal. Both this variety and the Albert Coal are strongly electrical when rubbed. .Jet resembles cannel coal, but is blacker, and has a more brilliant lustre. It occurs in detached pieces in clay, on the coast near Whitby in Yorkshire, and at Ballard Point, and elsewhere. It is the Gagates of Dioscorides and Pliny, a name derived from the river Gagas in Syria, near the mouth of which it was found. Brown coal is more recent in origin than the carboniferous era of geologists. It sometimes closely resembles common bituminous coal. Other varieties have a brownish-black color, bright coal-like lustre, with something of the texture of wood remaining; and often the form and ljbre ofthe original tree is retained : this is called Lignite. Lignite burns with an empyreumatic odor. Brown coal occurs in beds, usually of small extent, and is seldom as pure from pyrites as the more ancient bituminous coal. There are, however, some workable mines. , Professor W. R. Johnson obtained the following results in his analyses of coals : Vol. combus- Ash and Moisture, tible matter. Fixed carbon, clinkers. 1.

Dr. Wetherill obtained, (Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc. x, 353), Carbon 82*670, H 9*141, O, N, 8*189=100; and he states that 4 parts were soluble in ether and 30 in turpentine. For the geological evidence distinguishing coal of the true carboniferous era, reference may be made to geological treatises. The beds of coal occur interstratified with clay slate, and sandstone, or grit rock, forming distinct layers, varying from a fraction of an inch to 30 feet or more in thickness. In the United States, the anthracites occur east of the Alleghany range, in rocks that have undergone great contortions and fracturings, while the bitumin ous are found farther west in rocks that have been less disturbed ; and this fact and other observations have led some geologists to the view that the anthracites have lost their bitumen by the action of heat. Extensive beds of mineral coal occur in Great Britain, covering about one-tenth the whole area, or 11,859 square miles ; in France ; in Spain ; in Belgium, covering one twenty-second the whole area, or 518 square miles; in Netherlands, Prussia,"], [356, "28 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Bavaria, Austria, Northern Italy, Silesia, Spain, Russia on the south near the Azof. It is found in Asia, abundantly m China, in Persia in the Cabul territory, and in the Khorassan or Northern Persia, in Hindostan, north of the gulf of Cutch, in the province of Bengal (the Burdwan coal field) and Upper Assam, in Borneo, Labuan, Sumatra, several of the Philippines, Formosa, Japan, New South Wales and other parts of New Holland, New Zealand, Kerguelen's Land ; in America, besides the United States, in Chili, at the Straits of Magellan, Northwest America on Vancou ver's Island near the harbor of Camosaek, at Bellingham Bay in Puget's Sound, at Melville Island iu the Arctic seas, and in the British Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. In the United States there are four extensive coal areas. One of these areas, the Apalachian coal field, commences on the north, in Pennsylvania and southeastern Ohio, ,and sweeping south over western Virginia and eastern Kentucky and Ten nessee, to the west of the Apalachians, or partly involved in their ridges, it con tinues to Alabama near Tuscaloosa, where a bed of coal has been opened. It has been estimated to cover 65,000 square miles. It embraces several isolated patches in the eastern half of Pennsylvania. The whole surface in Pennsylvania has been estimated at 15,437 square miles, or one-third the whole area of the State. A second coal area (the Illinois) lies adjoining the Mississippi, and covers the larger part of Illinois, the western part of Indiana, and a small northwest part of Ken tucky ; it is but little smaller than the preceding. A third occupies a portion of Missouri and Iowa west of the Mississippi. The second and third are separated by only a narrow belt of silurian rock, and properly belong together as one ; and the united area is half larger than that of the Apalachian coal field. A fourth covers the central portion of Michigan. Besides these, there is a smaller coal region (a fifth) in Rhode Island, which crops out across the north end of the island of Rhode Island, and appears to the northward as far as Mansfield, Massachusetts. Out of the borders of the United States, on the northeast, commences a sixth coal area, that of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which covers, in connection with that of Newfoundland, 18,000 square miles, or 2-9ths the whole area of these Provinces. The mines of western Pennsylvania, commencing with those of the Blossburg basin, Tioga Co., those of the States weBt, and those of Cumberland or Frostburg, Maryland; Richmond or Chesterfield, Va., and other mines south, are bituminous. Those of eastern Pennsylvania, constituting several detached areas, \u2014 one the Schuyl kill coal field, on the south, worked principally at Mauch Chunk on the Lehigh, and at Pottsville on the Schuylkill ; another, the Wyoming coal field, worked at Car bondale, in the Lackawanna region, and near Wyoming, besides others intermediate, those of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and some patches in Virginia, are anthra cites. Cannel coal is found near Greensburg, Beaver Co., Pa. in Kenawha Co., Va., at Peytona, etc. ; also in Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana. In England, the principal coal fields are the Manchester of Lancashire and Chesh ire; the Great Central of South Yorkshire, Nottingham, and Derby; that of South Wales, Glamorganshire, <fec. ; the Newcastle field of northern England. In Scot land, a range of beds extends across from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde; whole area 1650 square miles. In Ireland, the three are the Limeric fields about the mouth of the Shannon, the Kilkenny fields to the eastward, and those of Ulster on the north.* Mineral coal occurs in France, in small basins, 88 in number, and covering in all, according to Taylor, 1-1 17th of the whole surface. The most im portant are the basin of the Loire, between the Loire and the Rhone, and that of Valenciennes on the north, adjoining Belgium. In Belgium, it occupies a western and eastern division, the western in the provinces of Namur and Hainault, and the eastern extending over Liege. Coal beds more recent than the true coal era are sometimes worked. That of * For full statistics with reference to coal and coal fields, reference may be made to the very complete work on coal by R.

Gray antimony occurs with spathic iron in beds, but generally in veins. It is often associated with blende, heavy spar, and quartz. It is met with in veins at Wolfsberg, in the flartz, and at Posing, near Presherg in Hungary. Its most celebrated localities, however, are Felsobanya, Schemnitz, and Kremnitz in Hungary, where it often occurs in diverging prisms, several inches long, accompanied by crystals of heavy Bpar and other mineral species. In Dum friesshire it occurs fibrous and laminated ; in Cornwall massive ; and compact at Magurka in Hungary. Also abundant in Borneo. In the United States, it occurs at Carmel, Penobscot Co., Me , and at Cornish and Lyme, N. H. ; also at \" Soldier's Delight,\" Md. This ore affords nearly all the antimony of commerce. The crude antimony of the shops is obtained by simple fusion, which separates the accompanying rock. From this product most of the pharmaceutical preparations of antimony are made, and the pure metal extracted. This ore was employed by the ancients for coloring the hair, eyebrows, Ac, to increase the apparent size of the eye ; whence they called the ore rr>,aTv6<p8ai\\iiov, from -rXnriit, broad, and oijeaXpos, eye. According to Dioscorides, it was prepared for this purpose by enclosing it in a lump of dough, and then burning it in the coals till reduced to a cinder. It was then extinguished with milk and wine, and again placed upon coals and blown till ignition ; after which the heat was discontinued, lest, as Pliny says, \" plumbum fiat,\" it become lead. It hence appears that the metal antimony was occasionally seen by the ancients, though not distinguished from lead.

Massive varieties of erubescite are found in the United States at Mahoopeny, near Wilkesbarre, Penn., and in other parts of the same State, in cupriferous shale, associated in small quantities with vitreous copper ; also in granite at Chesterfield, Mass., also in New Jersey. At the copper mine Bristol, Conn., it is abundant, and occurs in fine crystallizations, (f. 1, 14, 43, and 43 with planes 0). At Cheshire, it is met with in cubes, along with heavy spar, malachite, and vitreous copper. This species is a valuable ore of copper.

B.B. on charcoal decrepitates unless heated with caution, fuses, gives off sulphur, and at last affords a globule of pure lead. Galena occurs in beds and veins, both in crystalline and uncrystalline rocks. It is often associated with blende, iron, and copper pyrites, the carbonate and other lead ores, and occurs in a gangue of heavy spar, calc spar or quartz. At Freiberg in Saxony, it occupies veins in gneiss; in Spain in the granite hills of Linares, and also in Catalonia, Grenada, and elsewhere ; at Clausthal and Neudorf in the Hartz, and at Przibram in Bohemia, it forms veins in clay slate ; in Styria it occurs in the same kind of rock in beds ; at Sala in Sweden, it forms veins in granular limestone ; through the gray-wacke of Leadhills and the killas of Cornwall, are disseminated veins of this ore ; and in mountain limestone occur the rich repositories of Derbyshire, Cumberland, and the northern districts of England, as also those of Bleiberg, and the neighboring localities of Carinthia. In the Isle of Man, cubes 12 inches across occur. In the English mines it is associated with calcareous spar, pearl spar, fluor spar, heavy spar, witherite, calamine, and blende. Other localities are Joachimstahl, where it is worked principally for the silver ; in Bohemia southwest of Prague ; in the Daouria mountains, Siberia ; in Algeria ; near Cape of Good Hope ; in Australia. Extensive deposits of this ore in the United States exist in Missouri, Hlinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The ore occurs in what has been called \"cliff\" limestone, asso ciated with blende, calamine, (\" dry-bone\" of the miners), carbonate and sulphate of lime, pyrites, and often an ore of copper and cobalt. The mines of Missouri were discovered in 1720, by Francis Renault and M. la Motte ; they are situated in the counties of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison. The lead region of Wisconsin, according to D. D. Owen, comprises 62 townships in Wisconsin, 8 in Iowa, and 10 in Illinois, being 87 miles from east to west, and 54 miles from north to south. Throughout this region there is scarcely a square mile in which traces of lead may not be found. The occurrence of calc spar in the soil, or sink holes in lines, are considered indications of lead. The diggings seldom exceed 25 or 30 feet in depth. From a single spot, not exceeding 50 yards square, 3,000,000 lbs. of ore have been raised. The mines of the Upper Mississippi afforded in 1847 about 77,000 pigs of 70 pounds, and in 1850, 570,000; those of Missouri 125,000 to 150,000 pigs. Galena occurs also at Cave-in-Rock, in Illinois, associated with fluor spar. Veins at Rossie, in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., traverse, nearly perpendicularly, the gneiss of the region, and vary from one to three or four feet in width. Crystals often very large, (like f. 272, without i). It occurs with calcite, iron and copper pyrites, and some blende and celestine. NearWurtzboro, Sullivan Co., a large vein occurs in mill stone grit ; it is associated with blende, iron and copper pyrites. The Ancram lead mines, Columbia Co., have afforded considerable lead. In Maine, veins of con siderable extent exist at Lubec, where the ore is associated with copper pyrites and blende ; also less extensively at Blue Hill Bay, Bingham, and Parsonsfield ; in New Hampshire at Eaton, with blende and copper pyrites, and also at Haverhill, Bath, and Tamworth ; in Vermont at Thetford ; in Connecticut at Middletown, in a vein in argillite, massive and crystalline. Southampton, Leverett, and Sterling, Mass., afford small quantities of galena ; also Austin's mines in Wythe Co., Walton's gold mine in Louisa Co., and other places in Virginia; at Brown's Creek, and at Hays boro, near Nashville, it occurs with blende and heavy spar ; in the region of Choco late river and elsewhere, and Lake Superior copper districts. Argentiferous galena occurs at Monroe and Middletown, Ct. ; Bath, Haverhill, Eaton, Shelburne, and other places in New Hampshire, (C. T. Jackson). Galena in cubes is sometimes a furnace product, (Hausmann). Altered Forms. \u2014 Minium, anglesite, cerusite, pyromorphite, wulfenite, gray copper, dialogite, quartz, limonite, pyrites, calamine, occur as pseudomorphs after galena, partly from alteration and partly through removal and substitution. A change to the carbonate (cerusite) with the setting free of sulphur, is the most common. The supersulphuretted lead of Johnston is galena mixed with free sulphur.

B.B. infusible both alone and with borax, or only the thinnest edges rounded. By a strong heat in the outer flame on charcoal vapors of zinc are evolved, which coat the charcoal. Dissolves in nitric acid, during which sulphuretted hydrogen is dis engaged. Some specimens phosphoresce when struck with a steel or by friction. Blende occurs in both crystalline and sedimentary rocks, and is usually associated with galena; also with heavy spar, copper pyrites, fluor, spathic iron, and fre quently in silver mines. Derbyshire, Cumberland, and Cornwall, afford the black varieties ; also Transyl vania, Hungary, and the Hartz. Sahla in Sweden,Ratieborzitz in Bohemia, and many Saxon localities, afford splendid black and brown crystals. A variety having a divergent fibrous structure and presenting botryoidal forms, is met with in Corn wall ; at Raibel ; and at Geroldseck in Baden. Blende abounds with the lead ore of Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois. In New York, Sullivan Co., near Wurtzboro', it constitutes a large part of a lead vein in millstone grit, and is occasionally in octahedrons; in St. Lawrence Co., brown blende occur s at Cooper's falls, in a vein of carbonate of lime ; at Mineral Point with galena, and in Fowler, on the farm of Mr. Belmont, in a vein with iron and copper pyrites traversing serpentine ; at the Ancram lead mine in Columbia Co., of yellow and brown colors ; in limestone at Lockport, in honey and wax-yellow crys tals often transparent ; with galena on Flat Creek, two miles southwest of Spraker's Basin. In Massachusetts, at Sterling of a cherry-red color, with galena ; also yel lowish brown at the Southampton lead mines ; at Hatfield with galena. In New Hampshire at the Eaton lead mine ; at Warren, a large vein of black blende. In Maine it occurs at the Lubee lead mines ; also at Bingham, Dexter, and Parsonsfield. In Connecticut, yellowish-green, at Brookfield ; at Berlin of a yellow color ; brown ish-black at Roxbury, and yellowish-brown at Lane's mine, Monroe ; a white blende (Cleiophane of Nuttall) occurs at Franklin, N.

The hepatic cinnabar or liver ore is an impure variety, sometimes affording a brownish streak ; it is occasionally slaty, though commonly granular or impalpable in structure. Cinnabar occurs in beds in slate rocks, and rarely in granite or porphyry. It has been observed in veins, with ores of iron. Good crystals occur in the coal formations of Moschellandsberg and Wolfstein in the Palatinate ; also in Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. The most important European beds of this ore are at Almaden in Spain, and at Idria in Carniola, where it is usually massive. It occurs at Richenau in Upper Carinthia ; in beds traversing gneiss at Dunbrawa in Transylvania ; in gray wacke at Windisch Kappel in Car inthia; at Neumarktel in Carniola ; at Ripa iu Tuscany ; at Schemnitz in Hungary ; in the Urals and Altai ; in China abundantly, and in Japan ; at San Onofre in Mexico ; at Huanca Velica in Southern Peru, abundant ; in the Province of Co quimbo at Guallilinga and Punitaqui ; and forming extensive mines in California. The California beds occur at New Almaden, in a mountain to the south of San Jo.se', between the Bay of Francisco and Monterey. This ore is very abundant, and of easy access. The variety corallinerz, from Idria, has a curved lamellar structure. This ore is the source of the mercury of commerce, from which it is obtained by sublimation. When pure it is identical with the manufactured vermillion of com merce. The above figure is from an elaborate paper by Schabus, Wien. Akad. vi, 63. MILLERITE, Haid. Capillary Pyrites.

On charcoal in the exterior flame, converted into a globule of red oxyd of iron ; in the interior flame it fuses and continues to glow, after the blowpipe is removed. The mass on cooling, is magnetic and has a metallic crystalline structure, and a yellowish color on a surface of fracture. Dissolves in muriatic acid, excepting the sulphur. Crystalline plates of this species have been observed at Kongsberg in Norway, and at Andreasberg in the Hartz ; but they are of rare occurrence. It generally occurs massive, in fissures of crystalline rocks ; also found at Kupferberg in Siberia, Bodenmais, Breitenbrunn, Fahlun; at Joachimstahl on crystals of pyrargyrite. Cleavable varieties accompany iolite at Bodenmais in Bohemia. The compact specimens are abundant in Cornwall, at Appin in Argyleshire, Saxony, Siberia, and the Hartz. It has also been observed in the lavas of Vesuvius, and in some me teoric stones. Trumbull, Conn., and the adjoining town of Monroe, afford the cleavable varietv of this species ; at the former place it occurs in the topaz and fluor vein, at the latter in a quartz vein, in gneiss. Compact varieties occur with iron pyrites, at Stafford, Corinth and Shrewsbury, Vt., and in many parts of Massachusetts; also a mile and a half north of Port Henry, Essex Co., N. Y., near Natural Bridge in Diana, Lewis Co., and with magnetic iron ore at O'Neil mine, and elsewhere, in Orange Co., N. Y. In Canada in large veins at St. Jerome, &c. Its inferior hardness is sufficient to distinguish it from common pyrites. GREENOCKITE, Brooke and Connel, Jameson's Jour, xxviii, 390 ; Breithaupt, Pogg. li, 274. Sulphuret of Cadmium.

Some varie ties are very liable to decomposition on exposure to the atmosphere. A variety from Cornwall, Lebanon Co., Pennsylvania, gave J. C. Booth (as com municated to the author) 2*39 per cent, of copper, affording the formula (Fe, Cu) S3. The analysis afforded, S 53*37, Fe 44*47, Cu 2*39. This variety tarnishes, readily, assuming the bluish tarnish of steel. The ballesterosite is a variety in cubes from Galicia, containing traces of zinc and tin, (Bull. Geol. de F. vii, 21). A variety occurring with millerite at the Kearney Ore bed, Gouverneur, N. Y., is nickeliferous ; it is pale bronze and radiated botryoi- dal in structure ; H.=5*5; G.=4*863, (Am. J. Sci., [2], xv, 444.) It sometimes contains mechanically mingled, a minute quantity (perhaps one five thousandth part) of gold, and is then termed auriferous pyrites. Auriferous pyrites occurs in most gold regions. Iron pyrites occurs abundantly in rocks of all ages, from the oldest crystalline to the most recent alluvial deposits. It usually occurs in small cubes, but often modi- fied as above described ; also in irregular spheroidal nodules and in veins, in clay slate, argillaceous sandstones, the coal formation, &c. Cubes of gigantic dimensions have been found in some ofthe Cornish mines ; pentagonal dodecahedrons and other forms occur on the island of Elba, sometimes three or four inches in diameter. Large octahedral crystals are found at Persberg in Sweden. Magnificent crystals have been brought from Peru ; but still more brilliant and well-finished crystals occur at Traversella in Piedmont. Alston Moor, Derbyshire, Cornwall, Fahlun in Swe- den, Kongsberg in Norway, are well-known localities. The clay at Munden in Hannover, and the chalk at Lewes in Surry, have afforded some remarkable com- pound crystals. It has also been met with in the Vesuvian lavas in small irregular crystals. At Rossie, N. Y., fine crystals (f. 180, 181) occur at the lead mine in green shale ; at Scoharie, a mile west of the court house in single and compound crystals, often highly polished and abundant ; in interesting crystals at Johnsburgh and Chester, Warren Co., N.

Massive varieties are abundant in Connecticut in gneiss at Colchester, Ashford, Tolland, Stafford, and Union ; in Massachusetts at Hawley and Hubbardston ; in Maine at Bingham, (saw-"], [384, "56 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. mills), Brooksville, and Jewell's Island ; in New Hampshire at Unity ; in New York in Franklin, Putnam, and Orange Cos., and elsewhere. This species affords the greatest part of the sulphate of iron and sulphuric acid of commerce, and also a considerable portion of the sulphur and alum. The name pyrites is derived from the Greek, wplrns, a term applied to this mineral, because, as Pliny states, \" there was much fire in it,\" as was made apparent by fric tion. This term was applied to flint and some siliceous millstones for a similar reason. Altered Forms.\u2014 Pyrites readily changes to sulphate of iron by oxydation, some sulphur being set free ; also to limonite on its surface, by the action of bicar bonate of lime carrying off the sulphuric acid, as change proceeds; and from limo nite to red oxyd of iron. Green vitriol, Limonite, Gothite, Red iron ore, also Quartz, Graphite, occur as pseudomorphs after pyrites. HAUERITE, Haid. Naturwiss. Abhandl. of Vienna, 4to. 1847, i, pp. 101 and 107.

With silver and copper it occurs at Freiberg, Annaberg, and particularly Schneeberg in Saxony; at Joachim6tahl in Bohemia, the reticulated varieties are frequently found imbedded in calc spar ; also at Huel Sparnon in Cornwall ; at Riechelsdorf in Hesse, in veins in the copper schist ; at Tunaberg in Sweden ; Allemont in Dauphins. See analyses above, for the varieties at these localities. At Chatham, Conn., the Chloanthite (Chathamite) occurs in mica slate, associated generally with mispickel and sometimes with copper nickel ; affords but 1 or 2 per cent, of cobalt.

Radiated pyrites included the radiated masses and more simple crystals ; spear pyrites, the macled crystals ; hepatic pyrites, or leberkies, (so called from Jiraf>, liver), the decomposed liver-brown tessular crystals, which were originally iron pyrites, and also certain hexagonal pseudomorphs; cockscomb pyrites, or kammkies, the crest-like aggregations of this species of pyrites ; cellular pyrites, the cellular varieties formed by the decomposition of crystals of galena, which contained films of pyrites between its layers, thus producing a honeycomb appearance. The spear pyrites occurs abundantly in the plastic clay of the brown coal form ation, at Littmitz and Altsattell, near Carlsbad in Bohemia, and is extensively mined for its sulphur and the manufacture of the sulphate of iron. The radiated variety occurs at the same place ; also at Joachimstahl, and in several parts of Saxony. The cockscomb variety occurs with galena and fluor spar in Derbyshire. It occurs in stalactitic concretions in Cornwall. The kyrosite ( Weisskupfererz, or arsenid of copper, as it has been called) is from the mine Briccius, near Annaberg. The Chilian Weisskupfererz contains, according to Plattner, 12*9 per cent, of cop per, besides iron and sulphur, but no arBenic. (Breit. Pogg. lviii, 281)."], [389, "SULPHURETS, ARSENIURETS, ETC. 61 At Warwick, N. Y., it occurs in simple and compound crystals, in granite, with zircon. Hustis's farm, in Phillipstown, N.

Massive fibrous varieties abound throughout the mica slate of New Engltind, particularly at Cummington, Mass., where it is associated with cummingtonite and garnet. Occurs at Lane's mine, in Monroe, Conn., and in the topaz and fluor vein in Trumbull; also in gneiss at East Haddam; at Haverhill, N. H., with common pyrites. Cockscomb pyrites is employed in the manufacture of sulphur, sulphuric acid, and sulphate of iron, though less frequently than the common iron pyrites.

It is there associated with tin, erubescite, copper glance, galena, gray copper, .and blende. The copper beds of Fahlun in Sweden, are composed principally of this ore, which * For analyses of different ores from New Hampshire, see Geol. Rep. of that State, by C. T.

At Rammelsberg, near Goslar in the Hartz, it forms a bed in graywacke slate, and is associated with iron pyrites, galena, blende, and minute portions of silver and gold. The Kurprinz mine at Freiberg affords well defined crystals. It occurs also in the Bannat, Hungary, Thuringia ; in Scotland in Kirkcudbright and Wigtonshires, in Perthshire and Invernessshire ; in Tuscany, (analyses, 3, 4) ; in South Australia. In the United States it occurs at the Southampton Lead Mines, Mass., at Turner's falls on the Connecticut, near Deerfield, and at Hatfield and Sterling, Mass. : in Vermont, at Stafford, and at Corinth, Waterbury, and Shrewsbury : in New Hamp shire, at Franconia, in gneiss ; at Unity, on the estate of James Neal; at Warren, on Davis's farm ; at Eaton, two miles northeast of Atkins's tavern ; at Lyme, east of East Village ; at Haverhill and elsewhere : in Maine, at the Lubee lead mines, and at Dexter : in Connecticut, at Bristol and Middletown, sometimes in crystals : in New York, at the Ancram lead mine ; five miles from Rossie, beyond DeLong's mills at the Rossie lead mines in crystals ; in crystals and massive near Wurtzbo rough, Sullivan Co. ; crystals and massive at Ellenville, Ulster Co. : in Pennsylva nia, at Phenixville ; at Pottstown, Chester Co., (Elizabeth Mine) : in Virginia at the Phenix copper mines, Fauquier Co., and the Walton gold mine, Louisa Co. : in North Carolina near Greensboro', abundant massive, (Fenress or North Carolina, and Mac culloch Mines), along with spathic iron in a quartz gangue : in Tennessee, 30 miles from Cleveland, in Polk Co., (Hiwassee Mines), with black copper and pyrites : in the CatoctinMts., Maryland, and between Newmarket and Taneytown ; also abundant near Finksburg, Carroll Co., Md., (Patapsco and other Mines), along with erubescite, carrollite, and malachite ; in Canada, in Perth ; extensively mined at Bruce mines, on Lake Huron. The Cornwall copper pyrites is not a rich ore ; what is picked for sale at Red ruth rarely yielding 12, generally only 7 or 8, and occasionally but 3 or 4 per cent. of metal. Its richness may in general be judged of by the color ; if of a fine yellow hue, and readily yielding to the hammer, it may be considered a good ore ; but if hard, and pale-yellow, it is poor from admixture with iron pyrites. Copper pyrites is readily distinguished from iron pyrites, which it somewhat re sembles, by its inferior hardness ; it may be cut by the knife, while iron pyrites will strike fire with steel. The effects of nitric acid are also different. It differs from gold in being brittle, on which account it cannot be cut off in slices, like the latter metal ; and moreover gold is not attacked by nitric acid. Occurs as a furnace product near Goslar. Chalcopyrite is from -^aX/tos, brass and pyrites. Altered Forms. \u2014 Changes on exposure with moisture, especially if heated, to a sulphate.

B.B. on charcoal sulphur is expelled, and afterwards a black scoriaceous globule is obtained; the charcoal is covered with the oxyd of tin. With soda and borax yields a globule of impure copper. Soluble in nitro-muriatic acid, with the excep tion of sulphur. This species is found at Huel Rock, in the parish of St. Agnes, Cornwall, where it forms a considerable vein, and is accompanied by iron pyrites, blende, and other minerals ; also in granite at St. Michael's Mount ; also at Zinnwald iu the Erzge birge with blende and galena. It frequently has the appearance of bronze or bell metal, and hence the name bell-metal ore. STERNBERGITE, Haidinger, Edinb. Phil. Trans. xl, 1, and Brewster's Journal, vii, 242.

B.B gives off fumes of antimony and arsenic, finally melts, and after roasting, affords a globule of copper. When pulverized, dissolves with a little residue in nitric acid ; the solution has a brownish-green color. The Cornish mines, near St. Austle, afford large tetrahedral crystals ; their sur- faces are commonly rough and dull. More brilliant and highly modified crystalli- zations occur at Andreasberg in the Hartz, Kremnitz in Hungary, Freiberg in Saxony, Kapnik in Transylvania, and Dillenberg in Nassau. Those belonging to the Fahlerz (gray ore) of Werner, have a steel-gray color. The Schwarzerz is nearly iron-black ; this variety occurs principally at the old mine of Schwatz in the Tyrol, and at Kapnik in Transylvania ; also at Clausthal in the Hartz, where it is imbed- ded in red manganese. The Silberfahlerz has a light steel-gray color, G.=4*8 \u2014 6*1. A variety from McMakin's mine, Cabarras Co., N. C. (Anal. 18|) afforded Genth the ratio 4 : 5 between the sulphur of the sulphobases and sulphacids, instead of 4 : 3, as in the .above formula ; but the amount analyzed he observes was too small to authorize a separation of the mineral as a distinct species. It occurs with pyrites, galena, blende, talc, etc. It is associated usually with copper pyrites, and is worked as an ore of copper. An ore from mine Altar, 30 leagues from Coquimbo, afforded F. Field (Quart. J. Chem. Soc. iv, 332), S 30*35, As 3*91, Sb 20*28, Cu 36*72, Zn 7*26, Fe 1*23, Ag 0*075, Au 0*003. It is soft, of greasy appearance, greenish gray, Blightly reddish, with powder bright red. Domeyko considers it impure with blende, pyrites, and galena. Prof. Ettling observes (ib. vi, 140) that the constitution is analogous rather to enar- gite than tetrahedrite, corresponding to the formula 4 (-Gu, Zn, Fe, Ag) S+(Sb, As3) S6. The Aphthonite of Svanberg, (or Aftonite), from Wermland, (analysis 15), occurs massive of a steel-gray color and black streak; G.=4*87. H.=3. It gives the formula 7 R S+(Sb, As) Ss. It resembles an argentiferous tetrahedrite. A Weissgultigerz from the mine \" Hoffnung Gottes \" near Freiberg, contains 36 to 38 per cent, of lead. It afforded S 22*53, antimony (loss) 22*39, lead 36*51\u201438*26, Ag 5*92-5*78, Fe 3*72-3*83, Zn 3*15-6*79, Cu 0-19-0*32=100. It occurs massive, fine granular, mixed with a little blende and pyrites. G.=5*438 and 5*465. The sulphur ratio for the bases and acid is 3 : 2 ; but it becomes the tetrahedrite ratio 4 : 3, if part of the bases exist as impurities.

When heated, it usually decrepitates, owing to water between the lamin\u00e6 ; the native rock salt, containing no water, fuses at a red heat without de crepitation. The martinsite of Karsten (J. f. pr. Ch. xxxvi, 127) contains 9*02 per cent, of sul phate of magnesia, which is equivalent to 10 parts of common salt to 1 of sulphate of magnesia. It is from Stassfurth. Common salt usually occurs in extensive but irregular beds in rocks of various ages, associated with gypsum, polyhalite, clay, sandstone, and calcareous spar ; also dissolved, and forming salt springs. In Europe it usually occurs in the new red sandstone, or associated with red marl, but it is not confined to these rocks. At Durham, Northumberland, and Leicester shire, England, salt springs arise from the carboniferous series ; in the Alps, some salt works are supplied from oolitic rocks ; the famous mines of Cardona and Wie liczka are referred the former to the green sand formation, and the latter to tertiary rocks. Salt springs also occur in volcanic regions. In the United states the brines mostly come from Silurian sandstones. Salt also occurs as efflorescences over the dry prairies of the Rocky Mountains, and California ; and in most desert or semi-des *rt regions there are numerous salt lakes."], [419, "91 FLUORIDS, CHLORIDS, BROMIDS, IODIDS. The principal mines of Europe are at Wieliczka, in Poland ; at Hall, in the Tyrol ; and along the range through Reiehenthalin Bavaria, Hallein in Saltzburg, Halstadtj Ischl, and Ebensee, in Upper Austria, and Aussee in Styria; in Hungary, at Mar moros and elsewhere ; in Transylvania ; Wallachia, Gallicia, and Upper Silesia ; Vie and Dieuze in France ; Valley of Cardona and elsewhere, in Spain, formino* hills 300 to 400 feet high ; Bex, in Switzerland ; and Northwich in Cheshire, England. At Cheshire it occurs in a basin-shaped deposit, and is arranged in spheroidal masses, from 5 to 8 feet in diameter, which are composed of concentric coats, and present polygonal figures. It is but little contaminated with impurities, and is pre pared for use by merely crushing itbetween iron rollers. At the Austrian mines, where it contains much clay, the salt is dissolved in large chambers, and the clay thus precipitated. After a time, the water fully saturated with the salt, is convey ed by aqueducts to evaporating houses, and the chambers, after being cleared out, are again filled ; at Berchtesgaden, the water is saturated in a month, at Hall it takes nearly a year. It also occurs forming hills and extended plains near Lake Oroomiah.the Caspian, Ac. In Algeria, abundant ; in Abyssinia ; in India in the province of Lahore, and in the valley of Cashmere ; in China and Asiatic Russia ; in South America, in Peru, and at Zipaquera and Nemocon, the former a large mine long explored in the Cor dilleras of Granada. In the United States, salt has been found forming beds with gypsum, in Virginia, Washington Co., 18 miles from Abingdon, and in the SalmonRiver Mts. of Oregon. Brine springs are very numerous in the Middle and Western States. The most famous of these springs are atSalina, in N. Y., in the Kenawha Valley, Va., and Muskingum, Ohio, and in Kentucky. The salt water is obtained by boring, and raised by means of machinery, and thence conveyed by troughs to the boilers, where it is evaporated usually by the direct application of artificial heat ; som\u00ab times by the heat of steam, and occasionally by exposure to the heat of the sun. The following table by Prof. Beck, (Mineralogy of New York, p. 112), gives the amount of brine required for a bushel of salt at the principal salt springs in the United States : Galls.

Lake Timpanogos in the Rocky mountains 4,200 feet above the level of the sea, is 2,000 square miles in area. L. D. Gale found in this water 20*196 per cent, of chlorid of sodium, (Stansb. Exped. cited in Amer. Jour. Sci. [2], xvii, 129). The Dead and Caspian Seas are salt, and the waters of the former contain 20 to 26 parts of solid matter in 100 parts. Prof. Gmelin, who analyzed a portion of these waters of specific gravity 1212, found them to contain chlorid of calcium 3-336, chlorid of magnesium, 12*167, chlorid of sodium 7*039, sulphate of lime 0*052,bromid of magnesium, 0*443, chlorid of potassium 1*086, chlorid of aluminium 0*144, chlorid of ammonium 0*007, chlorid of manganese 0*161=24*435, with 75*565 water=l 00*000.

Occurs about volcanos, as at Etna, the island of Vulcano, Vesuvius, and the Sandwich Islands, and near Hecla after the eruption of 1845, as observed by Bunsen. It has been observed in small quantities in the vicinity of ignited coal seams, as at St.Etienne, in France, and also at Newcastle, and in Scotland ; crystallized near Dutt weiler in Palatia, Germany, where a coal seam has been burning for more than a hundred years. It occurs also in Bucharia ; at Kilauea in Hawaii, a variety which contains largely of iron, and becomes rusty yellow on exposure ; in Guano from the Chincha Islands. The aXf aiifiaviands, sal-ammoniac of Dioscorides, Celsius, and Pliny, is proved by Beckmann (Hist, of Inventions, iv, 360) to be common rock salt, dug in Egypt, near the oracle of Ammon. The name was afterwards transferred to the muriate of am monia, when, subsequently manufactured in Egypt. Sal-ammoniac is supposed to have been included by the ancients, with one or two other species, under the name of nitrum, which, according to Pliny, gave the test of ammonia when mingled with quicklime.

The largest masses, and particularly those of a green color, are brought from Peru, Chili, and Mexico, where it occurs with native silver. In Chilil it is a com mon ore of silver. It was formerly obtained in the Saxon mining districts of Johangeorgenstadt at Freiberg, but is now rare. A mass weighing six and three quarter pounds, from this region, is now in the Zwinger collection, at Dresden. It also occurs in Siberia ; at Kongsberg in Norway ; in Alsace ; in Cornwall, and at Huelgoet in Britanny. At Andreasberg in the Hartz, an earthy variety is met with, called by the Ger mans Buttermilcherz, which, according to Klaproth, contains silver 24*64, muriatic acid 8*28, alumina 67*08.

Ratoffkite is a granular or earthy-blue variety impure with clay, from Ratoff ka, Russia. Below a red heat, the coarsely pulverized spar is vividly phosphorescent ; the light is of various colors, and independent of the external color. The variety chlo rophane emits a bright emerald-green light. At a high temperature, phosphores cence ceases, but it is partially restored by an electric discharge. B.B. decrepi tates, and ultimately fuses to an enamel. If the flame be continued, the fluorine is in part expelled, and the specimen assumes a cauliflower appearance. Gives the reaction of fluorine. Seldom in beds, but generally in veins, intersecting gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, and also several secondary rocks. In the North of England, it is the gangue of the lead veins, which intersect the coal formations of Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire ; the Cumberland fluor often contains drops of fluid with in, especially the green variety, (Greg and Lettsom). In Derbyshire, it is abundant ; and also in Cornwall, where the veins intersect much older rocks. Common in the mining district of Saxony. In the dolomites of St. Gothard it occurs in pink octa hedrons; at Munsterthal in Baden in flesh-red hexakisoctahedrons. It has been detected in cannel coal by Prof. Rogers. A remarkable locality of fluor spar in the United States, now exhausted, was discov ered on the borders of Musealonge lake, in Jefferson Co., N.

Rossie and Johnsburgh. St. Lawrence Co., have afforded some fine crystals of fluor. In Gallatin county, Illinois, for thirty miles along the Ohio, in the region southwest of Cone's Rock, 10 to 15 miles be low Shawneetown, and other places, a dark purple fluor, often in large crystals, occurs through the soil, or in carboniferous limestone with galena. At the north village of Westmoreland, N. H., two miles south of the meetinghouse, of white, green, and purple shades, constituting a vein with quartz ; also, sparingly, at the Notch in the White Mountains, green octahedrons in a crystalline quartz. Some fine veins have been discovered on Long Island, Blue Hill Bay, Maine. It also oc curs sparingly of a green color at Putney, Vt. ; in Shenandoah county, Virginia, near Woodstock, in the fissures of a limestone; on the Potomac, at Shepardstown, in white limestone ; in Smith county, Tennessee, in white and purple cubes ; at Lockport, N.

The variety chlorophane forms two veins in gneiss, each about 18 inches wide, in the town of Trumbull, Conn., along with topaz and magnetic pyrites. Altered Forms. \u2014 Fluor spar is slightly soluble in waters containing bicarbonate of lime in solution. The alkaline carbonates decompose it, producing carbonate of lime or Calcite, and a subsequent change of the calcite may produce other forms of pseudomorphs. Fluor spar occurs changed to quartz, by substitution, and also to Limonite, Hematite, Lithomarge, Psilomelane, Calamine, Smithsonite, and Cerusite. YTTROCERITE, Berz.

With the three fluxes, the Finbo mineral behaves like fluor spar; the glass is however yellow in the oxy dating flame as long as hot, and becomes opaque sooner than the glass given by fluor spar. In a pulverized state, it dissolves completely in heated muriatic acid, forming a yellow solution. Occurs sparingly at Finbo and Broddbo, near Fahlun in Sweden, imbedded in quartz, and associated with albite and topaz. Also at Amity, Orange Co., N. Y. ; and in Mass., probably Worcester Co. The Amity mineral has been examined by J. E. Teschemacher. The Massachusetts mineral afforded Dr. C. T. Jackson, (Proc. Bost. Soc. N. Hist. 1844. p. 166), lime, yttria, oxyd of cerium, with some XI, Fe and Si, and a loss of 19*4. The mineral is mixed with fluor spar in the vein, and probably the specimen analyzed was not pure from it. Yttrocerite has been considered a fluor spar in which part of the lime is replaced by oxyds of cerium and yttrium.

Isolated crystals, sometimes an inch in diameter, are found imbedded in lithomarge at Chessy, near Lyons ; they are generally coated with malachite. Splendid specimens are brought from the Bannat and Ekatherinenberg in Siberia. It is abundant also in South Australia.

It has been observed crystallized and massive at Schuyler's, Somerville, and Flem ington copper mines, N. J., associated with chrysocolla and native copper; also in red shale near New Brunswick, N. J. ; with green malachite in trap, two miles from Ladenton, Rockland Co., N.Y. ; at Cornwall, Lebanon Co., Pa. ; in the Lake Superior Region. When found in large quantities, this species is valuable as an ore of copper. Altered Forms. \u2014 A deoxydation of the Red Copper Ore sometimes takes place, producing native copper. It also becomes carbonated and green, by means of car bonated waters, changing to Malachite or Azurite; or through a silicate in solution it is changed to Chrysocolla. Limonite occurs as a pseudomorph by substitution after Red Copper. MARTITE, Breit. Monometric.

The Monroe crystals, occur in a rock containing quartz, flesh-colored feldspar and dark-green hornblende, and are imbedded in each of these minerals; they are sometimes half an inch through. The association with hornblende which contains protoxyd of iron is urged by Mr. T. S. Hunt, (Am. J. Sci. [2], xiii, 370), as evidence that the crys tals are not pseudomorphous, as some have supposed. The change from magnetic iron to the peroxyd is one that may and does take place in nature, as is believed, and some of the so-called martite may be altered specular iron, although probably not all. Scacchi has observed regular octahedrons of specular iron at Vesuvius, which he considers compound crystals after the rhombohedral primary. But it is more pro bable that they are actually simple crystals of martite. G. H. O. Volger endeavors to show that the crystals are dimetric (Entwick. Min., 1854, 368) and pseudomorphous, probably, after the oxyd Fe O3, supposed by him to be isomorphous with anatase, whence he derives the name for the mine ral Eisenanatas. ISERINE. Monometric.

B.B. alone infusible ; red variety changes to brown, and even black and opaque, as the temperature increases, and on cooling becomes first green, and then nearly colorless, and at last resumes the red color. Fuses with difficulty with borax, but somewhat more readily with salt of phosphorus. Black varieties yield a deep green globule, owing to the iron they contain. The zinc varieties afford with soda oxyd of zinc. The varieties of this species have been denominated, according to their colors, as follows\"; the black varieties pleonaste : the scarlet spinelle ruby ; the rose red balas ruby ; the yellow or orange-red rubicelle : the violet colored almandine ruby. The oriental ruby is sapphire. Spinel occurs imbedded in granular limestone, and with calcareous spar in serpen tine and gneiss. It also occupies the cavities of volcanic rocks. In Ceylon, in Siam, and other eastern countries, it occurs of beautiful colors, as rolled pebbles in the channels of rivers. Pleonaste is found at Candy, in Ceylon, and hence was called Candite, by Bournon. At Aker, in Sweden, is found a pale blue and pearl-gray variety in limestone. Small black splendent crystals occur in the ancient scoria of Mount Somma, with mica and idocrase ; also in compact gehlenite, at Monzoni, in the Fassa valley. From Amity, N. Y., to Andover, N. J., a distance of about thirty miles, is a region of granular limestone and serpentine, in which localities of spinel abound. At Amity, crystals are occasionally 16 inches in diameter; and one collected by Dr. Heron, weighs forty-nine pounds ; it is in three pieces, and contains cavities studded with crystals of corundum ; colors, green, black, brown, and less com monly red, along with chondrodite, and other minerals. A mile southwest of Amity, on J. Lay ton's farm, is a remarkable locality; also on W. Raynor's farm, a mile to the north ; another half a mile north, affording grayish-red octahedrons ; and others to the south. Localities are numerous about Warwick, and also at Monroe and Cornwall, though less favorable for exploration than those at Amity, (form 1, also 1, i, 33, f. 308). Franklin, N. J. affords crystals of various shades of black, blue, green, and red, which are sometimes transparent, and a bluish-green ceylanite variety here, has the lustre of polished steel; Newton, N. J. pearl-gray crystals along with blue corundum, tourmaline, and rutile ; at Bryan, red, brown, green, and black colors, along with chondrodite. At Sterling, Sparta, Ham burgh, and Vernon, N. J., are other localities. Light blue spinels occur sparingly in limestone in Antwerp, Jefferson Co., N. Y., two and a half miles south of Oxbow, and rose and reddish brown in Gouverneur, two miles north and three-fourths of a mile west of Somerville, St. Lawrence Co. ; green, blue, and occasionally red va rieties occur in granular limestone at Bolton, Boxborough, Chelmsford, and Little ton, Mass. Soft octahedral crystals occur in Warwick, which, according to Beck, are spinels permeated with steatite or serpentine, (Min. N. Y., p. 318). They have"], [433, "105 MONOMETRIC OXYDS. ocen considered pseudomorphs. Good black spinel in Burgess, Canada West; blue with clintonite at Daillebout, C. E. The automolite occurs in taleose slate near Fahlun and elsewhere in Sweden. The dysluite is from Sterling, N. J., along with franklinite and willemite. Kreittonite is from Bodenmais ; and chlorospinel from Slatoust. The fine colored spinels, when of large size, are esteemed as gems. Altered Forms. \u2014 Acted on by silicate of magnesia in solution, and changed to Steatite or Serpentine, also when the alumina is not wholly removed by the process of change it becomes Volknerite, (fig6Sl-f-15fl).

With borax, in the oxydizing flame, fuses to a dull-red glass, which be comes clear on cooling, and often assumes a yellow tint ; in the reducing flame be comes bottle-green. Dissolves in heated muriatic acid, but not in nitric acid. Magnetite occurs in beds in gneiss or syenite, also in beds or isolated crystals in clay slate, hornblende slate, chlorite slate, greenstone, basalt, and occasionally in limestone. Often associated with emery. The beds of ore at Arendal and nearly all the celebrated iron mines of Sweden, consist of massive magnetite. Dannemora, and the Taberg in Smaoland, are en tirely formed of it. Still larger mountains of it exist at Kurunavara and Gelivara, in Lapland. Fahlun in Sweden, and Corsica, afford octahedral crystals, (f. 11), imbedded in chlorite slate. Splendid dodecahedral crystals occur at Normark in Wermland. The most powerful native magnets are found in Siberia, and in the Hartz; they are also obtained on the island of Elba. Extensive beds of magnetite occur in the counties of Warren, Essex, and Clinton, New York, in granite, syenitic granite, or allied rocks ; and in Orange, Putnam, Saratoga, Herkimer counties, <fec, in gneissoid granite, either in isolated masses or layers alternating with the layers of gneiss, (Beck) ; also in the mountain ous districts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and on the eastern side of Willis mountain in Buckingham Co.,Virginia ; at Franconia, N. H., in epidote and quartz, (f. 14); at Warwick, N. Y. ; near Morgantown, Berks Co., Penn., (f. 11, 14); at Marlboro', Rochester, Bethel and Bridgewater, Vt., in chlorite or chlorite slate, (\u00a3 11) ; at Swanzey, near Keene, and Unity, New Hampshire; at Deer Creek, Md. ; at O'Neilmine, Orange Co., N.

Masses strongly magnetic occur at Marshall's Island, Me. ; also at Magnet Cove, Arkansas ; at Goshen, Chester Co., Pa. Large beds at Hull, South Crosby, Marmora and Ma dre, Canada West, and Bromet, Sutton, Canada East, at Sutton in crystals. 14"], [434, "106 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. No ore of iron is more generally diffused than the magnetic, and none superior for the manufacture of iron. It is easily distinguished by its being attracted read ily by the magnet, and also by means of the black color of its streak or powder, which is some shade of red or brown in specular iron and brown iron ore. The ore when pulverized may be separated from earthy impurities by means of a mag net, and machines are in use in many parts of Northern New York for cleaning the ore on a large scale. Dimagnetite of Shepard (Am. J. Sci. [2], xiii, 392) appears to be a magnetite pseudomorph. The slender rhombic prisms occur upon a surface which is covered with small cubo-octahedrons, dodecahedrons and cubo-dodecahedrons of magnetite, and some small irregular cavities in the dimagnetite crystals contain similar crys tals; moreover no difference of lustre is perceived in a fractured surface ofthe magnetite and dimagnetite. The species imitated in the pseudomorph is probably Lievrite. The angle of the prism varies between 110\u00b0 and 115\u00b0, 'according to the author's measurements ; (Shepard gives the angle 130\u00b0). One crystal gave approxi mately 110\u00b0 and 70\u00b0; another 114\u00b0 20' and 65\u00b0 40'; another 112\u00b0 and 68\u00b0, and the obtuse edge was beveled in this last crystal by planes (il) inclined to the larger ones at an angle of about 160J\u00b0. The faces are even but not very bright. From Monroe, Orange Co., N. Y. Altered Forms. \u2014 By deoxydation through organic matter changed to protoxyd, which may become a carbonate or spathic iron. By oxydation becomes sesquioxyd of iron or Specular iron. Pseudomorphs of chlorite after magnetite have been reported. FRANKLINITE. Berth. Monometric Observed planes 1, /, O, 2, 22.

Not attractable by the magnet. Pitchblende accompanies various ores of silver and lead at Johanngeorgenstadt, Marienberg, and Schneeberg in Saxony, at Joachimsthal and Przibram in Bohemia, and Retzbanya in Hungary. It is associated with uranite at Tineroft and Tolearn mines near Redruth, in Cornwall ; also near Adrianople, Turkey ; at the Middle town feldspar quarry in octahedrons with truncated edges, according to Shepard. It is very valuable in porcelain painting, affording an orange color in the en amelling fire, and a black color in that in which the porcelain is baked. A labora tory has been opened at Joachimstahl, where the ore is converted into uranate of soda for use. The Pittinerz of Breithaupt has an olive-green streak. H.=3 \u2014 3*5. G.=4*8 \u2014 5.

Occurs at Copper Harbor, Kewenaw Point, Lake Superior, forming a vein in con glomerate, from which about 40,000 lbs. of the ore were removed ; it is now ex hausted. The crystals are imbedded in the masses, and Teschemacher and Hayes have considered them pseudomorphs after red oxyd of copper. J. D. Whitney ob jects to this view on the ground that the red copper of the vein is in octahedrons and not cubes, and that no evidence exists to prove that such a change has taken place. (See J. D.Whitney in Foster and Whitney's Report on Lake Superior Region, Part 2, p. 99). The Kupferschwarze or Black Copper of Werner is an impure, earthy black oxyd of copper, resulting from the decomposition of other ores, being mixed with more or less sulphuret of copper, pyrites, and other impurities.

Melts readily before the blowpipe, and is. easily reduced on charcoal to the metallic state. It is said to occur at Badenweiler in Baden, in quartz. Gerolt states that it has been ejected from the volcanoes of Popocatapetl and Jztaccituall, in Mexico. It is found in many places in the provinces of Chihuahua and Cohahuila in considerable quantities, having been collected along the streams between Ceralvo and Monterey, being supposed to come from the range of mountains running nearly north of Monterey. The specimens (often 2 or more cubic inches in size) are between orpi ment and sulphur yellow in color, and glisten like a granular mica of a nearly golden color. The natural surface is slightly crystalline and shining; and when broken it shows a scaly texture, (Bailey in Am. J. Sci. [2], viii, 420). Occurs also at Austin's mines, Wythe Co., Va.

Friction excites electricity, and in polished specimens the electrical attrac- tion continues for a considerable length of time. The red sapphire is sometimes called Oriental ruby; the yellow, topaz; the green, emerald; violet, amethyst ; and hair-brown, adamantine spar ; the asteriated crystals, asteria, a name used by Pliny. This species is associated with crystalline rocks, as granular limestone or dolomite, gneiss, granite, mica slate, chlorite slate. The fine sapphires are usually obtained from the beds of rivers, either in modified hexagonal prisms, or in rolled masses, accompanied by grains of magnetic iron ore, and several species of gems. The emery of Asia Minor, according to Dr. Smith, occurs in granular limestone. The best ruby sapphires occur in the Capelan mountains, near Syrian, a city of Pegu, and in the kingdom of Ava ; smaller individuals occur near Bilin and Mero- witz in Bohemia, and in the sand of the Expailly river in Auvergne. Blue sap- phires are brought from Ceylon ; this variety was called Salamstein by Werner. Corundum occurs in the Carniitic on the Malabar coast, in the territories of Ava, and elsewhere in the East Indies ; also near Canton, China. At St. Gothard it occurs of a red or blue tinge in dolomite, and near Mozzo in Piedmont, in white compact feldspar. Adamantine spar is met with in large coarse hexagonal pyramids on the Malabar coast, in Gellivara, Sweden. Emery is found in large boulders at Naxos, Nicaria and Samos of the Grecian islands; also in Asia Minor, 12 miles east of Ephesus, near Gumuch-dagh, where it was discovered in situ by Dr. J. Lawrence Smith, associated with margarite, chloritoid, pyrites, calc spar, etc. ; and also at Kulah, Adula, and Manser, the last, 24 miles north of Smyrna ; also with the nacrite (?) of Cumberland, England. Other localities are in Bohemia, near Pets- chau, in the Ural, near Katherinenburg, and in the Ilmen mountains, not far from Miask ; Frederick Valley, Australia. Blue sapphire occurs at Newton, N. J., (now rare), with hornblende, mica, feld- spar, and tourmaline, in granular limestone ; red variety at Vernon, N. J., near State line, crystals often several inches long; crystals of bluish and pink colors occur at Warwick, N. Y., in the cavities of large crystals of spinel. At Amity, N. Y., white, blue and reddish crystals accompany spinel and rutile in granular lime- stone. In Pennsylvania, grayish corundum occurs in large crystals in Delaware Co. ; near Village Green in Aston ; at Mineral Hill in loose crystals ; also in crys- tals at Umonville, Chester Co., abundant, with tourmaline in margarite, and in albite some masses weighing 4000 pounds, and crystals being occasionally 4 inches long. Pale blue crystals are found with kyanite at West Farms, Conn, near Litch- field. A boulder of blue massive corundum, affording broad cleavage surfaces, has been found in Buncombe Co., North Carolina ; and crystals and massive corundum in place in Gaston Co. ; and a fine red sapphire has been obtained in Cherokee Co., Georgia. In Canada at Burgess, red and blue."], [441, "HEXAGONAL OXYDS. 113 Red sapphire is the most highly esteemed. A crystal weighing four carats, per fect in transparency and color, has been valued at half the price of a diamond of the same size. They seldom exceed half an inch in length. Two splendid red crystals, however, having the form of the pyramidal dodecahedron, and \" de la longueur du petit doigt,\" with a diameter of about an inch, are said to be in the possession of the king of Arracan. Transparent blue sapphires are sometimes over three inches long. The sapphire is cut by means of diamond dust, and polished on copper or lead wheels with the powder of emery. The word sapphire is from the Greek camptipos, the name of a blue stone, and probably the lapis lazuli, which agrees with the character given it by Theophras tus, Pliny, Isidorus, and others.

Dissolves read ily in heated muriatic acid, when pulverized. This species includes the old species specular iron and red iron ore, the latter un erystallized, and presenting the color of the former when in powder. Specular iron includes specimens of a perfect metallic lustre; if the structure is micaceous, it is called micaceous iron. The varieties of a sub-metallic or non-metallic lustre, were included under the name of red hematite, fibrous rediron ; or if soft and earthy, red ochre, and when consisting of slightly coherent scales, scaly red iron, or red iron froth. Under this species must also be included different clay or argillaceous iron ores, many of which contain but small portions of iron ; reddle or red chalk, the \u2022ommon drawing material, which has an earthy appearance and a flat conchoidal fracture ; jaspery clay iron, more firm in its structure than the preceding, and hav ing a large and flat conchoidal fracture ; columnar and lenticular argillaceous iron, distinguished by a columnar or flat granular structure. Itabirite is a granular slaty rock consisting of specular or magnetic iron and quartz. Specular iron occurs in crystalline rocks ; also among the ejected lavas of Vesu vius, etc. Argillaceous ores form beds in secondary rocks. It is usually an associate of emery. Fine specimens of this species are brought from the island of Elba, which has af forded it from a very remote period, and is described by Ovid as \"Insula inexhaus tis chalybdum generosa metallis.\" The surfaces of the crystals often present an irised tarnish, and brilliant lustre. The faces O and i are usually destitute of this tarnish and lustre, and may therefore assist, when present, in determining the situ ation of other planes when the crystal is quite complex. St. Gothard affords beau tiful specimens, composed of crystallized plates grouped in the form of rosettes, and accompanying crystals of feldspar. Near Limoges, France, it occurs in large crys tals. Fine crystals are the result of volcanic action at Etna and Vesuvius, and particularly in Fossa Kankarone, on Monte Somma, where it incrusts the ejected lavas. Arendal in Norway, Langbanshyttan in Sweden, Framont in Lorraine, Dauphiny, and Switzerland, also afford splendid specimens. Red hematite occurs in reniform masses of a fibrous concentric structure, near Ulverstone in Lancashire, in Saxony, Bohemia, and the Hartz. In Westphalia it occurs as pseudomorphs of calcareous spar. In Brazil it is associated with quartz. Hematite, both compact, micaceous, and jaspery, is abundant in St. Lawrence and Jefferson Cos., N. Y., at Gouverneur, Hermon, Edwards, Fowler, Canton, <fce. Handsome irised crystallizations of specular iron are found at Fowler, in cavities in granular micaceous iron ore, associated often with splendid groups of quartz crys tals. Other localities are Woodstock and Aroostook, Me., and Liberty, Md. Oc curs also in the Blue Ridge, in the western part of Orange Co., Va. Micaceous iron in large masses, composed of irregular curved lamin\u00e6, occurs at Hawley, Mass., and Piermont, N. H. ; also eight miles above Falmouth, Stafford Co., Va., on the Rap pahannock river ; St. Armand, Canada East. Red hematite is found at Ticonderoga, upon Lake George. The iron mountain and Pilot Knob of Missouri are situated about fourteen miles from the La Motte lead mines, and ninety miles south of St. Louis. The Iron Mountain is 300 feet in height, and consists wholly of massive peroxyd of iron lying in loose blocks, which are largest about the summit, many 10 to 20 tons in weight. The Pilot Knob is estimated by J. D. Whitney at 650 feet in height; it is made up of a quartzose rock of the azoic period and is capped with specular iron which has an appearance of stratification and is micaceous in structure. Lenticular argillaceous ore is abundant in upper Silurian rocks, in Oneida, Herkimer, Madison, and Wayne Cos., N. Y., constituting one or two beds, ten to"], [443, "HEXAGONAL OXYDS. 115 twenty inches_ thick, in a compact sandstone; and the same exists in similar strata in Pennsylvania and as far south as Alabama. Large beds exist at Wallace Mine Lake Huron and McNab, and Marmora, Canada West. This ore affords a considerable portion of the iron manufactured in different coun tries. The varieties, especially the specular, require a greater degree of beat to smelt than other ores, but the iron obtained is of good quality. Pulverized red he matite is employed in polishing metals, and also as a coloring material. This spe cies is readily distinguished from magnetite by its reddish streak. Hematite, a word in use among the ancients, was applied to this species on ac count of the red color of the powder, from difia, blood. The term specular alludes to the brilliant lustre it often presents. Altered Forms.\u2014 By deoxydation through organic matter forms magnetite or pro toxyds; and from the latter comes spathic iron by combination with carbonic acid; or by further deoxydation through sulphuretted hydrogen, forms pyrites. By com bination with water, forms Limonite. Limonite, magnetite, and pyrites, constitute occurring pseudomorphs after Hematite. ILMENITE, Kupffer. Titanate of Iron. Crichtonite, Bournon.

Varieties. \u2014 This species includes several varieties which have been considered distinct species.

B.B. blackens and becomes magnetic and thin splint ers fuse ; with borax gives an iron reaction. Dissolves in warm nitro-muriatie acid. The following are the principal varieties of this species. Brown hematite includes compact mammillary and stalactitic varieties. Scaly and ochrey brown iron ore are decomposed earthy varieties, often soft like chalk ; yellow oehre is here included. Bog iron ore is a brittle or loosely aggregated submetallic ore, occurring in low marshy grounds. It proceeds from the decomposition of other species, and often takes the form of the leaves, nuts or stems, found in the marshy soil. Brown and yellow clay iron stone are hard and impure from admixture with clay or iron. Limonite occurs in secondary or more recent deposits, in beds associated at times with spathic iron, heavy spar, calcareous spar, aragonite, and quartz; and often with ores of manganese. Found in Cornwall, Clifton, Sandloge in Shetland, in Carinthia and Bohemia, at Siegen near Bonn, and at Villa Rica in Brazil. The bog ore forms large beds in Germany, Poland, and Russia. This ore is abundant in the United States. We mention a few only of its localities, aud would refer to the various geological reports for more complete lists. Extensive beds exist at Salisbury and Kent, Conn., also in the neighboring towns of Beekman, Fishkill, Dover, and Amenia, N. Y., and in a similar situation north at Richmond and Lenox, Mass. At Hinsdale it is the cement in a conglomerate quartz rock. It is very abundant at Bennington, Vt., also atMonkton, Pittsford, Putney, andRipton, of the same State. Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard are other localities ; also near Tinder's Gold Mine, Louisa Co., Va, there is an abundant deposit; at Birm ingham and elsewhere, Mo. The argillaceous varieties are abundant in Pennsyl vania, near Easton, and through the Lehigh range in Fayette Co., at Armstrong, Upper Dublin, and in Washington Co. In nodules from one inch to a foot in diam eter, it is met with at Bladensburg, Md. ; also in gravel hills, near Marietta in Ohio. An argillaceous ore is also found on Mount Alto, in the Blue Ridge, in Shen andoah Co., Va., and in Chatham and Nash Co., N. C. : also near the Iron Moun tains, Missouri. Limonite is one of the most important ores of iron. The pig iron, from the purer varieties, obtained by smelting with charcoal, is readily convertible into steel. That yielded by bog ore is what is termed cold short, owing to the phosphorus present, and cannot therefore be employed in the manufacture of wire, or even of sheet iron, but is valuable for casting. The hard and compact nodular varieties are employed in polishing metallic buttons, <&c.

The stalactitic occurs at Richmond, Mass., in a bed of limonite; also at Lenox, Mass. ; at the Clove mine, Union Vale, Duchess Co., N. Y., on limonite ; in Orange Co., N. Y. This species was named after Col. George Gibbs, the original owner (after exten sive foreign travel) of the large Gibbs' cabinet of Yale College. Appendix to Hydrous Oxyds.

The crystals are in all conditions from the pure spinel to octahedrons with rounded edges and pitted or irregular surfaces, and it also occurs in flattened nodules. The surfaces are sometimes soft and altered, when the edges or angles have the hardness of spinel. Mr. S. W. Johnson, who has redescribed the mineral, obtained in one analysis, (Am. Jour.

The cooled globule is glassy, and opaque if any gypsum is present. Found abundantly in the crater of Vulcano, one of the Lipari isles, forming a layer on the sulphur, and around the fumaroles or exits of the sulphureous exhala tions. It is obtained for the arts from the volcanic fumaroles of Tuscany. The first locality known was at Sasso, whence the name, Sassolin. The hot vapors at the lagoons or boiling .springs of Tuscany, consist largely of boracic acid. The vapors are made to pass through water, which absorbs the boracic acid ; the waters are then evaporated by means of the steam from the springs. They yield seven to eight thousand pounds troy per day. These lagoons spread over a surface of about 30 miles, and in the distance, clouds of vapor are seen rising in large volumes among the mountains. On approaching the places, the earth seems to pour out boiliDg water, as if from volcanoes of various sizes, and the heat in the immediate vicinity is intolerable and the sulphurous smells suffocating.

The varieties arise either from crystallization, mode of formation, or impurities * and are naturally distributed into three series, (lst), presenting the bright glassy lustre of broken quartz crystal ; (2d), presenting the glistening subvitreous or waxy lustre, and translucency, or subtransparency of Chalcedony; (3d), with the nearly dull lustre, dull colors, and opacity of Jasper. I. T)ie vitreous varieties. Rock crystal includes pure crystals of quartz. This stone, when cut for jewelrj*, is called \" white stone.\" An asteriated variety contains whitish impurities or opacity arranged along the diametral planes. Amethyst is a clear purple or bluish-violet variety of quartz crystal. The color is supposed to be due to a small percentage of oxyd of manganese. But Heintz, in an analysis of a Brazilian specimen, obtained, besides silica, 0*0187 oxyd of iron, 0*6236 lime, 0*01.33 magnesia, and 0*0418 soda; and he considers the color owing to a compound of iron and soda. Rose quartz has a rose-red or pink color, and is transparent, or nearly so. G. 2*6569 before heating, 2*6578 after heating, E. Wolff. It becomes very pale on ex posure to the light. Usually massive, and often much cracked. The lustre is vit reous, sometimes a little greasy. The color is attributed by Fuchs to oxyd of tita nium, who detected 1 to 1^ per cent, in specimens from Rabenstein, near Bodenmais. Berthier states that the color is due to organic matter. It probably arises from manganese, the color being similar to that of manganese spar. False topaz is a light yellow pellucid variety of quartz crystal. It resembles yel low topaz, but is distinguished by its crystalline form, and the absence of cleavage. Smoky quartz, or Cairngorm stone, has a brownish smoky tint. The crystals are often pellucid ; but occasionally the color is so deep as to render them nearly opaque, except in thin fragments. Milky quartz, as the name implies, has a milk-white color. It is a massive vit reous variety, and one of the most common. It has sometimes a greasy lustre, and is then called greasy quartz. Prase is a leek-green variety of massive quartz. Aventurine quartz is minutely spangled throughout the mass with yellow scales. It is usually translucent, and of a gray, brown, or reddish-brown color. Siderite. An- indigo or Berlin-blue variety, from Golling, near Saltzburg. Ferruginous quartz is of an opaque-red, brownish-red, or ochre-yellow color, which is due to oxyd of iron. It occurs in distinct crystals ; the crystals are some times minute and aggregated into masses, like the grains of sand in sandstone. II. Chalcedonic varieties. Chalcedony has usually the subdued lustre of wax, either translucent or subtrans- parent ; some milk-white varieties opaque. Occurs in mammillary and botryoidal shapes ; also as stalactites, in cavities lined or roofed with chalcedony. According to Fuchs, it is true quartz with some opal disseminated through it. Chrysoprase. An apple, or leek-green variety of chalcedony ; it is colored by nickel. Carnelian. A reddish variety of chalcedony, generally of a clear bright tint. Passes into common chalcedony through grayish-red varieties. Heintz by his anal- ysis shows that the color is due to oxyd of iron ; he found peroxyd of iron 0*050 per cent., alumina 0*081, magnesia 0*028, potash 00043, soda 0'075. Sard, a deep brownish-red chalcedony, of a blood-red color by transmitted light. Agate, a variegated chalcedony, the colors in clouds, spots, or bands, the banded consisting of parallel or concentric layers, and either in straight, circular, or zigzag forms. The last are called fortification agates, from a resemblance to the angular outlines of a fortification. In other agates the colors are owing to foreign matter disseminated through the mass. Moss agate or Mocha stone is a chalcedony con taining within dendritic or moss-like delineations of an opaque brownish-yellow color, which are due to oxyd of manganese or iron."], [476, "148 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Onyx. Resembles agate, but the colors, usually a light clear brown and an opaque white, are arranged in flat horizontal planes. When the layers consist of sard and white chalcedony, the stone is called sardonyx. Cass eye. A translucent quartz, presenting a peculiar opalescence, or glaring in ternal reflections, when cut en cabochon, which effect is owing to filaments of as bestus. The color is commonly light greenish-gray \u2014 sometimes yellow, red or brownish. Flint. Somewhat allied to chalcedony, but more opaque, and of dull colors, usually gray, smoky-brown, and brownish-black. The exterior is often whitish, from mixture with lime or chalk, in which it is imbedded. Lustre, barely glisten ing, subvitreous. Breaks with a deeply conchoidal fracture and a sharp cutting edge. The flint of the chalk formation consists largely of the remains of infusoria, sponges, and other marine productions. The silica of flint, according to Fuchs, is partly soluble silica, easily taken up by a solution of potash. There is usually one per cent, or so of alumina and peroxyd of iron, with one or two of water. Hornstone. Resembles flint, but more brittle, the fracture more splintery. Chert is a term often applied to hornstone, and to any impure flinty rook, including the jaspers. Plasma. A faintly translucent chalcedony, approaching jasper, having a green - ish color sprinkled with yellow and whitish dots, and a glistening lustre. III. Jaspery varieties. Jasper. A dull red, yellow, brown, or green siliceous rock, sometimes blue or black, compact, nearly or quite opaque, and presenting little beauty until polished. When the colors are in stripes it is called Striped or Riband Jasper. Egyptian Jas per is zoned with colors, and forms nodules. Porcelain Jasper is nothing but ba ked clay, and differs from true jasper in being fusible on the edges before the blow pipe. Red porphyry often resembles jasper, but is nearly pure feldspar, and is also somewhat fusible. Blood stone or Heliotrope. Color, deep green, with interspersed, blood-red spots, like drops of blood. Lydian stone, Touchstone, or Basanite. A velvet black siliceous stone or flinty jasper, used on accouut of its hardness and black color for trying the purity of the precious metals. The color left on the stone after rubbing the metal across it, in dicates to the experienced-eye the amount of alloy. Besides the above, there is a light spongy variety of quartz, called float stone \u2014 quartz nectique of Haiiy \u2014 which is so light as to float on water. It consists of fibres or filamentary crystals, aggregated into a spongy or porous mass. Siliceous sinter is a light cellular quartz. This term is also applied to a similar variety of opal. Tabular quartz consists of thin plates, either arranged parallel, or cross ing one another and leaving open cells. Yellowish white earthy deposits, like chalk in appearance, occurring in the low er part of the chalk formation at Farnham, England, and elsewhere, are found by J. T. Way to contain 40*30 per cent, of soluble silica (soluble in solutions of caustic potash or soda on boiling in open vessels) and 41*23 of insoluble silica, with 14*50 alumina, etc. (Qu. J. Chem. Soc. vi, 102). It is therefore related to opal. Granular quartz is a massive quartz rock, of a granular texture. Its colors are various, always dull. Itacolumite is a fissile quartzose rock, containing some mica. Buhrstone is a cellular flinty quartz rock. Phthanite (Kieselschiefer) is a flinty fis sile rock, gray, black or greenish. Sandstone usually consists of quartz sand. Flexible sandstone is a fissile variety, thin slabs of which are somewhat flexible ; it is a variety of itacolumite. Silicified wood is wood petrified by silica or quartz. It has usually the structure ofthe original wood. A delicate fibrous quartz occurs at Orange river, near the Cape of Good Hope. Haytorite is a name given to pseudomorphous quartz having the form of Datho lite. Quartz, in some of its varieties, occurs in almost every rock-stratum. It is an essential constituent of granite, gneiss, and mica slate, and other allied rocks. The chalcedonic varieties occur principally in the vesicular cavities of basaltic and al lied rocks. Flint occurs imbedded in chalk. Hornstone is sometimes imbedded in limestone. Jasper is associated with limestone, like hornstone, and also with basal tic rocks and porphyry."], [477, "QUARTZ. 149 Switzerland, Dauphiny, Piedmont, the Carrara quarries, and numerous other foreign localities, afford fine specimens of rock crystal. The most beautiful ame thysts are brought from India, Ceylon, and Persia, where they occur in geodes and as pebbles ; inferior specimens occur in Transylvania, in large crystalline groups; in the vicinity of Cork, and on the island of May, in Ireland. The false topaz is met with in Brazil. Rose quartz occurs in a vein of manganese, traversing the granite of Rabenstein, near Zwiesel, in Bavaria. Prase is found in the iron mines of Breitenbrunn, near Schwartzenberg, in Saxony. The amygdaloids of Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, afford magnificent specimens of Chalcedony; also Iliittenberg and Loben in Carinthia, &e. A small blue variety, in cubical crystals, (pseudo morphs of fluor), occurs at Treszytan, in Transylvania. The finest cornelians and agates are found in Arabia, India, Surinam, and Saxony. Perthshire, and other parts of Scotland, afford smaller, but handsome specimens. Chrysoprase occurs at Kosemiitz in Silesia. Aventurine quartz at Cape de Gata in Spain. Cat's eye, in Ceylon, the coast of Malabar, and also in the Hartz and Bavaria. Plasma, in India and China, whence it is usually brought in the form of beads. Heliotrope, in Bu charia, Tartary, Siberia, and the island of Rum in the Hebrides. Float stone, in the chalk formation of Menil Montant, near Paris, and in some of the Cornish mines. The banks of the Nile afford the Egyptian jasper ; the striped jasper is met with in Siberia, Saxony, and Devonshire. A yellow jasper is found at Vourla, bay of Smyr na, in a low ridge of limestone, to the right of the watering place, between the harbor and the high hills back. It is associated with opal, chrysoprase, and horn stone, and these minerals seem to occupy in the limestone the place of hornstone, which is found in various parts of the adjoining country, and also at Napoli di Romania, in Greece. The plains of Argos are strewn with pebbles of red jasper. A variety of sandstone occurs in thin layers at Villa Rica, Brazil, remarkable for its flexibility, owing apparently to the dissemination of small scales of mica through the mass ; a similar flexible sandstone occurs in the North Carolina gold region. Quartz crystals are abundant in HerkimerCo., N. Y., at Middleville, Little Falls, Salisbury, and Newport. They lie loose in cavities in the calciferous sand-rock, or imbedded in loose earth, and sometimes, according to Beck, in powdered anthracite. Fine dodecahedral crystals are obtained at the beds of specular iron in Fowler, Hermon, and Edwards, St. Lawrence Co., New York. In Gouverneur, crystals oc cur with tourmaline, &c, in limestone, which have rounded angles as if they had been partially fused. On the banks of Laidlaw lake, Rossie, there are large implanted crys tals. The Sterling ore bed, Antwerp, Jefferson Co., affords interesting dodecahedral crystals. Four miles east of Warwick, crystals presenting the primary form occur in jasper. At Palatine, Montgomery Co., crystals occur having one end terminated with the usual pyramid, while the other is rounded and smooth. Diamond Rock, near Lansingburg, is an old but poor locality. At Ellenville lead mine, Ulster Co., N. Y., in elegant groups. At Diamond Island and Diamond Point, Lake George, quartz crystals occur, as in Herkimer Co. Crystals with unusual modifications oc cur sparingly at the Charlestown syenite quarry, Mass., one of which from the cab inet of Mr. J. E. Teschemacher is represented in fig. 344 B.

Chalcedony and agates of moderate beauty are found in the same trap region ; more abundantly about Lake Superior, the Mississippi, and the streams to the west ; at Natural Bridge, Jefferson Co., N. Y. ; about the Willamet, Columbia, and other rivers in Oregon ; abundant and beautiful on N. W. shore of Lake Superior. Belmont's lead mine, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., has afforded good chalcedony and chrysoprase, asso ciated with calc spar. Red jasper is found on Sugar Loaf Mt., Maine, and in peb bles on the banks of the Hudson at Troy. Yellow jasper occurs with chalcedony at Chester, Mass. Heliotrope occupies veins in slate at Bloomingrove, Orange Co., N. Y. Quartz, chalcedony, prase, carnelian, hornstone, constitute many of the pseudo morphs formed by substitution,(see chapter on Chemical Mineralogy). Pseudomorphs, after hexagonal and scalenohedral crystals of calcite and cubes of fluor, occur at West hampton. Mass. ; after heavy spar, probably, in Rutherford Co., N. C. often filled with water. Petrified wood consists of quartz, and sometimes of chalcedony or agate, of rare beauty. Quartz crystals occasionally occur of enormous size. A group in the museum of the university at Naples, weighs nearly half a ton. A crystal, belonging to Sig. Rafelli of Milan, measures three and a quarter feet in length, and five and a half in circumference, and its weight is estimated at eight hundred and seventy pounds ; another at Paris is three feet in diameter, and weighs eight hundred weight. About a century since, a drusy cavity was opened at Zinken, which afforded 1000 cwt. of rock crystals, and at that early period brought $300,000. One crystal weighed 800 pounds. A group from Moose Mountain, New Hampshire, at Dartmouth College, weighs 147 i pounds, and contains 48 crystals ; four of them are from 5 to 5-J- inches in diameter, ten from 4 to 4s- inches. A crystal from Waterbury, Vt., 2 feet long and 18 inches through, weighs 175 pounds. Crystals often exhibit internal iridescences, owing to fissures or fractures. Foreign substances frequently penetrate or thoroughly permeate crystals of quartz. Oxyd of iron has already been alluded to as one of these permeating substances. Chlorite is sometimes so thoroughly intermingled, that the crystals appear to be composed en tirely of this material; their hardness, however, 6hows their siliceous nature. Anthra cite, asbestus, actinolite, tourmaline, silver and copper are other penetrating sub stances. \u2022 Specimens containing acicular crystals of rutile are often very beautiful. The most interesting of the substances occurring in quartz are the fluids, which occupy small cavities in the interior of crystals ; they are either water, peculiar resinous liquids, or mineral solutions. Mr. Allan describes a crystal of amethyst in his collection, having four cavities partly filled with a bituminous fluid ; at 83\u00b0 F., the fluids dilates and fills all the cavities, and on cooling reappears with ebullition. Silica is held in solution in the Geysers of Iceland and New Zealand, whose sol vent powers are due to their temperature, and a small quantity of alkali present. It is also present in traces in ordinary waters, as alkaline silicates. Several varieties of this species have long been employed in jewelry. The ame thyst has always been esteemed for its beauty. Like most other stones, it is less brilliant by candle light ; it appears to best advantage when surrounded with pearls and set in gold. The color of the amethyst is often irregularly diffused, as is well described by Pliny, \" ad viciniam crystalli descendet albicante purpur\u00e6 defec tu,\" purple, gradually fading into white. It was called amethyst, ujiiQuiiTos, on ac count of its pretended preservative powers againt intoxication, from a, not, and jitSvu, to intoxicate. This is not, however, the only amethyst of the ancients. The violet colored sapphire, the violet fluor spar, (scalpturis faciles, Plin. easily graven), and some other purple species, were designated by the same name ; and it has been supposed that garnet was also included. Cameos are in general made of onyx, which is well fitted for this kind of minia ture sculpture. The figure is carved out of one layer, and stands in relief on an other of different color. The most noted of the ancient cameos, is the Mantuan vase at Brunswick. It was cut from a single stone, and has the form of a cream pot, about seven inches high and two and a half broad ; on its outside, which is of a brown color, there are white and yellow groups of raised figures, representing"], [479, "QUARTZ, 151 Ceres and Triptolemus in seaeh of Proserpine. The Museo Borbonico, at Naples contains an onyx measuring eleven inches by nine, representing the apotheosis of Augustus, and another exhibiting the apotheosis of Ptolemy on one side, and the head of Medusa on the other ; both are splendid specimens of the art' and the former is supposed to be the largest in existence. The carnelian (sarda of Pliny) receives a fine polish, and is often rich in color * but is too common to be much esteemed. When first obtained from the rock car nelians are usually gray or grayish-red ; they receive their fine colors from an exposure of several weeks to the sun's rays, and a subsequent heating in earthen pots. The colors of agate, wheu indistinct, may be brought out by boiling in oil, and afterwards in sulphuric acid ; the latter carbonizes the oil absorbed by the apparently porous layers, and thus increases the contrast of the different colors. Agate is often made into mortars for chemical and pharmaceutical preparations', and according to Pliny, it was employed for the same purpose by the physicians of his day. The royal collection at Dresden contains a table service of German agate ; and at Vienna, in the imperial cabinet, there is an oval dish twenty-two inches in length, formed from a single stone. The agate, or achates of the Greeks, was so called from the river Achates, in Sicily, whence, according to Theophrastus, these stones were originally brought. Iaspachates corresponded to our jasper agate ; Sardachates contained layers of the sard, or carnelian ; Dendrachates (from Sci/l}ov, a tree aud achates) was moss agate ; H\u00e6machates (from ii/ia, blood, and achates) was an agate, sprinkled with spots of red jasper, (Moore's An. Min.) Jasper admits of a brilliant polish, and is often formed into vases, boxes, knife handles, <fec. It is also extensively used in the manufacture of Florentine mosaics. Theiaspis of the ancients, whence our word jasper is derived, appears to have inclu ded the green or blue colored variety, together with some other stones, not of the jasper kind. Quartz is distinguished by its Hardness, \u2014 Scratching glass with facility ; Infusi bility,\u2014'Sot fusing before the blowpipe ; Insolubility, \u2014 Not attacked by water or the aeids ; Uncleavability, \u2014 One variety is tabular, but proper cleavage is never distinctly observed. To these characteristics the action of soda may be added. OPAL. Hyalite. Miiller's Glass. Hydrophane. Menilite. Cacholong. Siliceous Sinter. Pearl Sinter. Fiorite. Girasol. Eisenopal, Haus.

Eire opal or girasol presents bright hyacinth-red and yellow reflec- tions. Common opal and semi-opal are common varieties not opalescent. Hydro phone is not transparent, but becomes so when immersed in water. Cacholong is nearly opaque, and of a porcelain or bluish white color ; it adheres to the tongue, and contains a small portion of alumina, with 3*5 p. c. of water. It is closely allied to hydrophane, and often associated with it. Hyalite, or Midler's glass, occurs in small reniform, botryoidal, and occasionally stalactitic shapes, either colorless and pellucid, or white. Menilite is brown and opaque, occurring in compact reniform masses, occasionally slaty. Opal jasper contains several per cent, of iron, and i6 the analogue in this species of jasper in the preceding. Silicious Sinter is a loose silicious aggregate, deposited by the Geysers of Iceland, where it presents porous stalactitic, fibrous, \" cauliflower-like,\" and occasionally compact concretions, called geyserite by Damour.

Common opal sometimes occurs in limestone. Menilite is met with in clay slate. Some varieties are found with galena and blende, in metalliferous veins. It also occupies the interior of fossils in sandstone. The precious opal occurs in porphyry at Czerwenitza, near Kashau in Hungary, at Frankfort, and at Gracias a Dios in Honduras, S. A. Fire opal is brought from Zimapan in Mexico, and from the Faroe Islands. The common opal is abundant in Hungary, in Faroe, Iceland, the Giants' Causeway, and the Hebrides; found also within a half mile, and to the southwest, of the watering place at Vourla, the har bor of Smyrna, along with yellow jasper and hornstone, imbedded in a low ridge of compact limestone, of a light yellow or grayish-white color ; colors wax-yellow or grayish-green, occasionally white. Hungary affords also the hydrophane. The Giants' Causeway affords small masses resembling mountain cork, which though opaque, become translucent on immersion in water. Cacholong occurs in loose masses on the river Cach, in Bucharia, whence its name. Hyalite occurs in amyg daloid at Sehemnitz, in Hungary, and in clinkstone at Waltsch, in Bohemia. Men ilite is found imbedded in adhesive slate, at Menil Montant, near Paris. Wood opal forms large trees in the piumice conglomerates of Saiba, near Neusohl, and Krem nitz in Hungary, in Faroe, near Hobart Town, Tasmania, and other trap countries. The Randanite is abundant near Algiers, and was taken for Kaolin ; also at Ceys sat, near Randan in the Puy de Dome. Hyalite occurs in the United States, sparingly at the Phillips ore bed, Putnam Co., N. Y. in thin coatings on granite ; and rarely with the auriferous quartz of Ca barras Co., N. C. ; also in Burke and Scriven Cos., Georgia. In Georgia it lines cavities in a siliceous shell-rock. The Suanna spring in Florida, affords small quan tities of siliceous .sinter. Good fire-opal is obtained in Washington Co., Ga. The precious opal, when large, and exhibiting its peculiar play of colors in per fection, is a gem of high value. It is cut with a convex surface. The largest mass of which we have any knowledge, is in the imperial cabinet of Vienna ; it is nearly as large as a man's fist, and weighs 17 ounces, but contains numerous fissures, and is not entirely free from the matrix.

[The different species of Silicates are widely varied in their characters through the mutual replacements of lime, potash, soda, magnesia, protoxyd of iron, and other protoxyds, represented by the general expression (B ;) and also of the peroxyds, alumina, peroxyd of iron, etc. (fi).' The mere presence of one or another of these bases affords therefore no ground for distinctions in classification. The only general fact of a constant character is the almost total absence of magnesia from the feldspars, (and also the zeolites), and, in fact, from all those species in which the protoxyds aud peroxyds are to one another in the ratio of 1 : 1, (IR : IK,) that is, which have 1 : 3 for the oxy gen ratio. I divide the anhydrous silicates, as has been explained, into a few grand groups, dependent on the oxygen ratio for the oxygen of the bases and silica ; these ratios being, 1 : 3, 1 : 2, 1 : 1^*, 1 : 1, 1 : f or less than \u00a3.) The feldspars, although seemingly unconformable to this system, still have been shown to have the type-ratio 1 : 1, this occurring in Anorthite ; the additional silica in the other species, being added without changing the crystallization or typical structure. A general principle is here indicated which modifies the law of ratios, and which is exemplified also in the micas, scapolite, hornblende, and some other species. It has been observed that while some species contain water, without its affecting the crystalline form, so there are silicates, not hydrous, in which there is an addition of accessory substances which do not modify the form, and which substances thus appear to be in a certain sense unessential. Thus So dalite, Hauyne and Nosean, have each the ratio 1:3:4, and a common for mula, with the addition of some Na Cl for Sodalite, (5a g for Hauyne, and Na g for Nosean. By considering these as ingredients essential to the type, the species would be widely separated from their congeners."], [483, "SILICATES. 155 The above facts contain the principles upon which the anhydrous silicates are arranged. They are more fully developed in the chapter on Chemical Mineralogy and Classification. Besides the ordinary chemical formulas, which have the advantao-e of a familiar form and look, we add the condensed formulas, explained in our chapter on Chemical Mineralogy. There is little reason to doubt that the protoxyds and peroxyds replace one another, 3 parts of R replacing 1JJ ; or generally that proportions of oxyds equal in amount of included oxygen are mutual substitutes in compounds. Thus R3, K and K are equivalents. In this view, the complex silicates are simply silicates of a single complex base. Thus the general garnet formula is (R3, fi)Si; under which the following are among the special formulas, Garnet, (i R'-Rfi) Si, Epidote, (i R3-Bfi) gi, j(iR3-f-|fi)Si, ?(fR3+ffi)gi, Idocrase, which differ from one another only in the ratio of R3 to fi, it being 1 : 1 m Garnet, 1 : 2 in Epidote, 1 : 1 or 3 : 2 in Idocrase \u2014 the fractions within the brackets equaling together a unit and indicating this ratio. Such formulas give the constitution of the species with all the precision of the old formulas, exhibiting the exact relations of the constituents, without any hypothesis as to their atomic groupings.] The following are the subdivisions of the Anhydrous Silicates.

Composition. \u2014 R3Si8, in which R maybe lime, magnesia, protoxyd of iron or man- ganese, or even soda ; and in some instances alumina enters into the composition without changing essentially the crystallization, and usually replaces silica. When R=(Ca, Mg), the color is white or light green ; when R=(Ca, Fe), the color varies in shade of green to black, according to the proportion of oxyd of iron ; if R=Mn, the color is flesh-red, and the mineral is manganese spar. It may also be (Ca, Mn), or (Ca, Mg, Fe), or (Fe, Mn), and when iron is abundant the mineral is very dark green or black. There are other kinds arising from mode of crystallization, the species being sometimes in distinct crystals, sometimes thin foliated, sometimes granular, and often fibrous or asbestiform. The following are the prominent varieties : \u2014 1 Diopside, White Augite, White Malacolite, Mussite. \u2014 Of white, grayish, or grayish-green color, either crystallized, lamellar or granular. The granular, when coarse and somewhat friable, is called white coccolite. Alalite is a diopside from Ala in Piedmont. Mussite has a grayish-green color, and is lamellar parallel to the base, the lamell\u00e6 sometimes contorted ; it is from Mussa in Piedmont. These va- rieties contain. thebases magnesia and lime, with little or no iron, and usually no alumina, (Ca, Mg)3Si8. G.=3*23 \u2014 3*26. Diopside is from Sis, two-fold, and ot^i?, ap pearance; malacolite, from paAa/raj and Xi&os. Sahlite resembles diopside, but has a dingy greenish color, and is coarse foliated, arising from composition parallel to 0 ; from Sahla, Sweden. Baikalite is a green variety, from Lake Baikal. Pyrgom is a dingy variety of sahlite, (named from the Greek irvpyapa.) Omphazite is a foliated leek-green variety. The same constitution as above, but usually with some iron. G.=3*23 \u2014 3*3.

Green Coccolite is a granular friable variety, consisting of bright green shining granules, named from kokkos, a grain. Funkite is a green coccolite. Lherzolite has a deep green, or olive- green color, and occurs both crystallized and lamellar ; from Lake Lherz in the Pyrenees. Baikalite (from Lake Baikal) is an olive-green sahlite. These species contain the bases lime, magnesia, and protoxyd of iron, (Ca Mg, Fe)8Si8. G.=3*25 \u20143*3. Jeffersonite is a dark-green crystallized foliated variety, from Mine Hill, Frank- lin, New Jersey : it has the same constitution and angles as the last, with some oxyd of zinc.

Breislakite occurs in wool-like forms at Vesuvius and Capo di Bove. Its crystal- lographic identity with pyroxene has been shown by Chapman, (Phil. Mag. xxxvii, 444, 1850). Named after Breislak, an Italian geologist. Hedenbergite is a black pyroxene, containing largely of iron, little or no mag- nesia, and no alumina (6a, Fe)3Si8. G.=3*5. Named after the Swedish Chemist, L. Hedenberg. Hudsonite, from Orange Co., N.

Diallage, (from iiaWayn, difference, alluding to the dissimilar cleavage). \u2014 Thin fo- liated and easily cleavable; lamin\u00e6 brittle; color various shades of green, gray, and brown, and sometimes bronze or pearly-metallic. G.=3-ll \u2014 3*227. It includes Schiller spar (in part) and Bronzite. Bronzite has a greenish-brown or brownish color, and metalloidal lustre ; it cleaves in three directions, two of which meet at an angle of 87\u00b0. G.=3*125. From Gulsen in Styria. Hypersthene, (from vircp and aBcvos, very strong or tough), bears nearly the same relation to diallage that the dark varieties of pyroxene bear to the light. It con- tains a large proportion of iron and little lime, yet varies much in this respect, and some varieties, not distinguished by external characters, have the composition nearly of diallage. Its colors are grayish or greenish-black, and copper-red, with a bright metallic-pearly lustre. It cleaves easily, but not into as thin folia as the preceding. G.=3*3 \u2014 3-6. The Paulite (G.=3-389) is from the island of St. PauL Labrador Hornblende and Metalloidal Diallage are here included. The Bronzitehas clove-brown and pinchbeck brown colors, with a metallic-pearly lustre. G.=3*2 \u2014 3-5. Cleavage orthodiagonal, very perfect.

B.B. the whitish or pale varieties fuse with some effervescence to a colorless glass ; with borax afford a clear glass. Varieties containing iron afford an iron reaction, which is more intense the greater the proportion. The Hedenbergite and dark augites fuse readily to a shining black glass. Diallage yields some water in a mat rass, and becomes of a paler color ; on charcoal it fuses with difficulty on the edges to a gray slag ; with borax it forms a glass colored with iron. Bronzite be comes of a paler color, but alone is infusible. Hypersthene generally fuses on char coal rather easily to a grayish-green glass, not clear. Hudsonite fuses with effer vescence to a black magnetic bead ; with soda, a manganese reaction. Pyroxene is principally confined to crystalline or volcanic rocks, and is associ ated at different localities with granite, granular limestone, serpentine, greenstone, basalt or lavas. Diallage occurs generally in serpentine or greenstone ; and hypersthene with feldspar and quartz forms hypersthene rock, which occurs ex tensively in some districts of crystalline rocks. Pyroxene, with labradorite or oliglocase, forms Greenstone or Diabase; and when the texture is very compact, it constitutes Melaphyre, which is reddish-brown to black. With labradorite and magnetite, forms Dolerite or Basalt, often crystal line granular, and called basalt more especially when the texture is impalpable. Py roxene is common in lavas, and is a constituent of Tufas. Foreign localities are numerous and we mention but few. Augite occurs at Aussig and Teplitz, in Bohemia, in large crystals imbedded in basalt; and in small highly polished crystals in the lavas of Vesuvius, with nephe line, idocrase, and mica. Diopside is met with in crystals at Ala, in Piedmont, as-"], [491, "SILICATES, AUGITE SECTION. 163 sociated with garnets and talc in veins traversing serpentine. Its more tranparent crystals from this locality are sometimes cut and worn as gems. Sahlite is met with in granite rocks at Sahla, and elsewhere. Baikalite occurs principally on the bor ders of Lake Baikal. Omphazite accompanies granular garnet at the Sau Alp, in Carinthia, and near Ilof, in Bayreuth, with the smaragdite variety of hornblende, which it much resembles. White subtransparent crystals are met with at Bytown, Lower Canada, in lime stone, often measuring an inch by one and a half inches; grayish-green'in lime stone with phlogopite at Grand Calumet, Id.; crystals sometimes 1 ft. long and 4 in. wide, and having attached small crystals of greenish hornblende, at the high falls of the Madawaska, Canada. White flattened prismatic crystals, two or three inches long by one or two in breadth, occur in dolomite at Canaan, Conn. ; large green crystals in the limestone of Trumbull ; small transparent crystals with gran ular pyroxene, in Reading, Conn., on the turnpike near the line of Danbury. The Bolton quarries, Mass., afford good crystals. The dolomite of New York Co., N. Y., affords white crystals, often several inches long, and also the abandoned quarries at Kingsbridge, about 208th street. In Orange Co. there are interesting localities, affording, besides fine crystals, many of the massive varieties, from white to black colors, the former in limestone, the latter usually with magnetic iron ; at Two- Ponds, in Monroe, in simple or grouped crystals, often large, associated with scapo lite, zircon, and sphene in white limestone: another, half a mile east of Green wood furnace, along with mica in limestone, where one crystal was obtained six inches long and ten in circumference; two and a half miles north of Eden ville, gray crystals. Near Amity and Fort Montgomery, are other good localities. Dark green or black crystals in limestone a mile northwest of Edenville. In Putnam Co., near Patterson, grayish-white crystals are abundant, strewed over the surface and in limestone. In Westchester Co., white at the Sing Sing quarries. Other good localities in New York, are at Rogers' Rock, Lake George, massive, and gran ular, (coccolite), of gray, green, and brown colors; on the banks of Vrooman lake, near Oxbow; in Diana, Lewis Co., in black crystals ; at Fine, St. Lawrence Co., where the crystals are very large. Franklin, N. J., also affords good pyroxene. Massive varieties occur at most of the above mentioned localities. Crystals of black augite in trap at Montreal, Boueherville and Rougemont Mountains, C. E. A beautiful green coccolite, and also crystals (f. 356) occur near Long Pond, Essex Co.. N. Y., and a blaek coccolite in Monroe, Orange Co., a mile west of Coffee's Hotel ; at Willsboro', N.

But the min eral from these localities, although presenting the external characters of this vari ety, differ much from one another in composition, (analyses 39, 40), and still more from the Labrador hypersthene, (analysis No. 42). It is also found with andesite rock at Chateau Richer and at St. Ad'ede, Mille Isles, Canada, (analysis 44), grayish black and brown, with lamin\u00e6 curved. The Hudsonite of Beck (analyses 28 and 29) occurs in a vein of quartz in Cornwall, Orange Co., N. Y. The Polylite of Thomson may possibly come from the same locality ; Thomson attributes it to Ho boken, which Beck states must be an error. \u2022 Pyroxene was thus named by naiiy from *vp, fire, and afoot, stranger, in allusion to its occurrence in lavas, where Haiiy supposed it did not belong, or was a stranger."], [492, "164 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Crystals of this species have been obtained by fusion, and are not unfrequent, of a black color, among the iron slags of Sweden. Mitscherlich and Beudant have formed white crystals by heating together silica, lime, and magnesia. Altered Forms. \u2014 Pyroxene undergoes alteration in different ways, as has been well explained by Bischof. When containing much protoxyd of iron, as in many varieties, the iron, if moisture is present, undergoes oxydation, becoming brown or brownish-red and hydrated, or of a red color and anhydrous ; or is carbonated and becomes gradually removed and the result uncolored, if carbonic acid is present In au early stage of alteration, crystals often develop a basal cleavage. The car bonic acid of infiltrating waters when lime is present, carries off the lime, leaving the most of the magnesia, as in the change to Rensselaerite ; or by continuing its action, carries off the magnesia and gives origin, if the pyroxene is aluminous, to a hydrous silicate of alumina, like Cimolite ; an addition of alumina may probably take place through the accompanying decomposition of associated feldspar. Acted on by sulphuric or sulphurous acid about volcanoes, the protoxyd bases are rapidly removed, and a hydrous aluminous silicate is left, and often a siliceous deposit or sinter. Acted on by alkaline carbonates in solution, a similar result is produced, but alkalies take the place of the removed bases, and an alkaline silicate of alumina or of iron and alumina is formed, as Green earth; or under different circumstances there is a change to mica. Acted on by waters containing traces of bicarbonate of magnesia in solution, magnesia is exchanged for the lime, and thus pyrallolite, hypers thene and hornblende, may be formed from Augite ; and the removal of the lime en tirely, and its replacement by magnesia, gives origin to serpentine, steatite, talc, sap onite. Silicates of iron and magnesia may also proceed from the action of alkaline silicates or carbonates. Tufas consist largely of altered augite, and are formed from augitic sands under the action of steam or heated waters, thus becoming a hydrous silicate of alumina, etc. ; such, according to Bunsen, is the Palagonite of Waltershausen The following are analyses and descriptions of some of the more prominent re sults of alteration. 1, 2, Waltershausen, (Vulk.

Augite altered to Hornblende is found in Uralite, which has the form of Augite, with the cleavage and composition of hornblende. Pyroxene from Taberg and Pargas, and a variety from the Azores, also have a hornblende composition, while some hornblendes, as a tremolite from Pennsylvania, and a hornblende from Hartlingen, have the composition of Augite. These transitions are explained by Bisehof, as above, (see p. 164). Scheerer considers them cases of paramorph ism, or a change from one of the two forms of a di morphous compound to the other, augite and horn blende being dimorphous. The annexed table shows the relations in form of the two species referred to the augite type ; it presents the symbols of the planes in hornblende. Sandberger has observed crystals of au- Observed Planes in Hornblende, gite and hornblende forming a made together ; and in (P- 1^\u00a3feJr*edB.to the some cases the hornblende crystals are implanted around the augite. Sandberger and Blum regard facts of this kind as proving that the two species may form simultaneously. (Sandberger, Pogg., lxxxiii, 453).

It may well be doubted whether these substances are, all of them, distinct chem ical compounds. Waltershausen makes out another allied compound which he calls Trinacrite. constituted as above given. It is dull brown and cleavable or mieaceous, and is mixed with his Siderosilicite, a hydrous silicate of peroxyd of iron and alumina.

Ch. Phys.. [3], xxxviii, 237), as consisting of silicates R3 Si2+Aq and R gi-)-Aq, combined with one another. To the Palagonite of Iceland, he gives the formula, R3 Si8+2R Si+Aq, to that of the Galapagos, fl3 Si8+R Si+Aq ; and he observes 'that the pa lagonite occurs as the basis of the basaltic tufas of Germany, France, Azores Cana ries, Cape Verdes, Tortugas, and probably also of the Pacific Islands. He gives analyses which show great uniformity of composition in the basaltic tufas, and compares it with the constitution of pyroxene, the alteration of which is the source of the peculiarities of the tufa. He also observes that the Palagonite may be made artificially by putting powdered basalt into a large excess of caustic potash in fu sion and pouring on water ; the product, after washing, is hydrated, pulverulent, and gelatinizes with weak acids, and its composition is like that of the purest pa lagonite of Iceland. The origin of the Palagonite is hence attributed to the altera tion of pyroxene rocks, in which process the iron is peroxydized. Boltonite, Shepard. Disseminated massive.

Boltonite is disseminated through white limestone at Bolton, Mass., and also at Roxbury and Littleton.

Schlieper found his specimen (one furnished by the author and seemingly unalter ed) to consist partly of carbonate of manganese and other bases. By digestion in concentrated muriatic acid, it afforded 90*15 per cent, of silicate of manganese, and 9*85 soluble portion. The latter gave on analysis, Mn C 50*52, Fe C8*60, CaC 37*17, MgC2*44, fl and loss 1*27=100. Ten per cent, of carbonates had been previously found in the Cummington mine ral, by E. Hitchcock. Allowing that the ten per cent, of carbonates in Schliep er's specimen had been formed at the expense of the bases in the Rhodonite, and also that there was some free silica in minute points or grains, as was obvious to the eye, the oxygen ratio cannot be taken as different from that of Rhodonite. B.B. becomes dark brown, and imlts to a reddish-brown glassy globule ; with the fluxes gives the reaction of manganese. In powder, partly dissolves in muriatic acid, and the insoluble part becomes of a white color. Darkens on exposure to the air, and often becomes nearly black. Occurs at Langbanshytta, near Phillipstadt in Sweden, in iron ore beds, in broad folia, and also granular massive ; also at Elbingerode, in the Hartz ; in the district of Ekatherinenburg, in Siberia ; with gray copper ore at Kapnik, in Transylvania ; in Cornwall. Paisbergite is from Paisberg's iron mine in Phillipstadt, Sweden. * Occurs in boulders in the town of Cummington, Mass., and some ofthe neighbor ing towns, and has been observed also in Warwick, of the same State, on the other side of the Connecticut. Also in an extensive bed on Osgood's farm, Blue Hill Bay, Maine ; in Irasburgh and Coventry, Vt. ; near Winchester and Hinsdale, N. H. An ore from Stirling, New Jersey, gave Thomson the angle 1 23\u00b0 30', which is near the angle of hornblende, but we have not been able to verify the result. Thomson's analysis of this ore, if correct, would make it a manganese augite or Rhodonite, (Min. i, 515), and this sets aside his measurements, or at least throws doubts upon them. He found the specific gravity 3*586. The Fowlerite which occurs in large crystals with franklinite, at the Franklin Furnace, Hamburgh, at Stirling, N. 3., has been analyzed by W. Camae, (Am. J. S.

He unites with it Thom son's Stirling ore."], [497, "169 SILICATES, AUGITE SECTION. Altered Forms. \u2014 Rhodonite changes partly to a carbonate, by the action of waters holding alkaline carbonates in solution, as exemplified in remarks above ; and also becomes altered by the tendency of protoxyd of manganese to pass to a higher state of oxydation, accompanied with the absorption of water. By the last process, the red color becomes brown and black, and indefinite compounds or mix tures result, which may be either partly silicates, or wholly an oxyd of manganese.

Crystals often in long slender blades, either distinct and traversing the gangue, or aggregated in columnar and radiated masses. G.=2*93. Transparent\u2014 translucent. Catamite (fr. calamus, a reed) is asparagus green in crystals. Raphilite (ir. fasti, needle) is an asbestiform tremolite from Lanark, Canada.

Bright-green bladed crystals or columnar forms ; if in distinct crystals, glassy actinolite. The crystals are long, slender prisms, and break easily across the prism. The fibrous or radiated crystal lizations are often named asbestiform actinolite. The green color is owing to a small proportion of oxyd of iron, and on account of the iron present, the specific gravity of actinolite is above that of tremolite, usually between 3*02 and 3*05. Anthophyllite, (fr. anthophyllum). Fine columnar, or made up of acicular fibres of brown or grayish-brown color, often submetallic. G.=2*94 \u2014 3*16. The cleavage affords prisms of 124\u00b0 30', like other varieties of hornblende. Formula, FeSi+Mg! Si2=Silica 58*6, magnesia 25*9, protoxyd of iron 15*5. Asbestus, (fr. auScuroi, unconsumable), when of a white color or some light shade, is a fibrous variety of tremolite or actinolite. The fibres are often as fine as flax, and may be separated with the fingers. By traversing limestone or the gangue that contains it, it often gives an asbestiform appearance to large masses of the rock. The more delicate varieties, presenting the lustre of satin, are called Amianthus, (fr. apiavros, undefiled). \u2014 The fibres of asbestus are sometimes so interlaced that the fibrous structure is not apparent ; this variety is called mountain leather, and rock or mountain cork ; the former occurs in flexible lamin\u00e6 or sheets, resembling leather, and the latter has the feel and nearly the texture of cork : both are so light, owing to the loose interlacing of fibres, as to float on water. Pargasite. Pargasite includes crystallized varieties (crystals usually thick and stout) of high lustre and rather dark shades of green ; it is also granular. Hornblende. The name hornblende, as originally applied, belonged only to the dark green and black varieties, whether in crystals or massive. It contains much iron and alumina ; G.=3*l to 3*1. The name alludes to the toughness. Carinthine is a hornblende (aluminous and ferruginous) from Carinthia. G.=3*127- Arfvedsonite.

Formula, NaSi+Fe3Si2=Silica 49*4, protoxyd of iron 39*3, soda 11*3. It is very fusible, melting even in the flame of a candle. Named after Pro fessor Arfvedson of Sweden. \u00c6girine, as analyzed by Plantamour, is ablack hornblende related to Arfvedson ite. A black or greenish-black Brevig mineral so-called is pyroxene. Hornblende Rock and Amphibolite are names of rocks consisting of hornblende, and having a crystalline granular texture, sometimes slaty. Corneine is a compact hornblende rock of smooth fracture, extremely tough and sonorous when struck. The name is from the Latin for horn. Diastatite. A hornblende from Wermland, differing a degree, according to Breithaupt, in the angle of the prism from hornblende. G.=3*09 \u2014 3*1. Uralite (from the Urals) has the cleavage structure and composition of horn blende, though the external form of augite, and is considered a pseudomorph.

Cummingtonite is an anthophyllite variety containing largely of oxyd of iron resembling an asbestiform tremolite, often scopiformly arranged ; color ash-gray, lustre silky. B.B. alone fuses with great difficulty. Formula, (f Fe+| Mg)1 Si3, Smith and Brush, (Anal. 15, 16.) The analysis by Thomson, (Ann. Lye. Nat. Hist New York, iii, 50), referred by Shepard to Boltonite, is shown by B. Silliman, Jr., (Am. J. Sci. [2], viii, 391), to per tain probably to an actinolite from Bolton. The Raphilite, according to Hunt, has the augite oxygen ratio 2 : 1, (anal. 9). The fluorine in many hornblendes is supposed to exist as fiuorid of calcium, aud this ingredient, according to Bonsdorff may constitute 1 part in 5 of the mineral. B.B. the tremolite and pale varieties, containing no iron, fuse readily with intumescence to a glass nearly transparent to milk-white ; and with borax form a transparent colorless glass. The lighter colored varieties containing iron, fuse alone with more or less difficulty to a dark yellowish glass, and with borax give a trans parent glass, tinged with iron. The darker green varieties afford a deeper iron color. The hornblende, containing alumina and little iron, acts much like tremolite ; but the black varieties fuse to a brilliant black bead, and the borax glass is tinged with iron. Anthophyllite fuses with great difficulty to a glass colored by iron. Arf vedsonite fuses readily with intumescence to a black magnetic globule. Green or black hornblende is one of the constituents of syenite and greenstone, as well as hornblende rock and slate. Tremolite is most common in dolomite and granular limestone. Hornblende also occurs in granular limestone and in trachyte. Actinolite is found in the greatest perfection in taleose rocks. Asbestus often trav erses serpentine rocks and granular limestones. Much of the so-called asbestus in serpentine is Chrysotile. Aussig and Teplitz in Bohemia, Tunaberg in Sweden, and Pargas in Finland, af ford fine specimens of the dark colored hornblendes. Actinolite occurs at Saltz burg and Greiner, in the Zillerthal ; Tremolite at St Gothard, in granular lime stone or dolomite, the Tyrol, the Bannat, Gulsjo in Sweden, <fec. Calamite occurs at Normarken in Sweden, in prisms in serpentine. Asbestus is found in Savoy, Saltzburg, the Tyrol ; also in the island of Corsica, where it is so abundant that Dolomieu employed it in packing his minerals. Rock cork is obtained in Saxony, Portsoy, and Leadhills, where also mountain leather occurs. Oisans, in France, affords a variety of amianthus, composed of fibres having some degree of elasticity ; it is the amianthoide of Haiiy. Anthophyllite comes from Kongsberg, Norway, Ac. Arfvedsonite was brought first from Greenland, where it is associated with soda lite. It occurs also at Fredericksvarn, in Norway. In the United States, black crystals of hornblende occur at Franconia, N. H. ; at Chester, Mass. ; at Thomaston, Me. ; at Moultonboro', Me., in Syenite ; atWillsboro', N. Y., presenting interesting crystalline forms ; also near the bridge at Potsdam, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. ; near Greenwood Furnace, and in Warwick, Orange Co., N. Y. (f. 365.) Crystals of a dark green color occur near Two Ponds, and also a mile north, two and a half miles north, and a mile south of Edenville, together with gray or hair brown crystals and tremolite, sphene, and chondrodite, in gran ular limestone. Near Amity, hornblende occurs of various forms and colors, and often in large and perfect crystals : in dark green crystals, with ilmenite, at the Stirling mines, Orange Co. ; at Gouverneur, in short green crystals, sometimes two or three inches in diameter, along with apatite ; in Rossie, two miles north of Ox bow, the variety pargasite in neat bright green crystals. Pargasite occurs also at Phipsburg and Parsonsfield, Me. Gray hornblende or tremolite in good crystals is found at Bryam, N. J., and other varieties at Franklin and Newton of the same State."], [503, "SILICATES, AUGITE SECTION. 175 Large flattened crystals of a white color abundant in dolomite at Canaan, Conn., between the falls and the post office, and other places in Litchfield Co. ;' also at Lee (one and a half miles southwest of the meeting house) and Newberg, Mass. * in Diana, Lewis Co., N.

Actinolite occurs also in Pennsylvania, in Providence, Mineral Hill, Delaware Co. ; at Union ville; at Kennett, Chester Co., often in fine crystals; radiated and asbestiform tremolite abundant in the dolomite of New England and New York ; at Thomas ton and Raymond, Me. ; Lee and Great Barrington, Mass. ; in New York at Dover, Kingsbridge, the Eastchester quarries, at Hastings and near Yonkers in Westches ter Co. ; at Knapp's quarry, Patterson, and on the banks of Yellow lake and elsewhere in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. The same varietia;S occur at Franklin, N. J. ; in Pennsylvania, at Chesnut Hill, near the Wissahiccon ; near Philadelphia, at Lon don Grove, Chester Co. ; at the Bare Hills, Md. Asbestus is met with at many of the above localities; at West Farms, Win chester, Wilton, and Milford, Conn. ; at Brighton, Sheffield, Pelham, Newbury, and Dedham, Mass. ; in New York, near Greenwood Furnace, Roger's farm in Patterson, Colton rock and Hustis's farm in Phillipstown, (both asbestus and amianthus), near the quarantine, Richmond Co., asbestus with the fibres be tween two and three feet in length ; at Chesnut Hill, Penn. ; Cooptown and Bare Hills, Md. ; and Barnes's Mills, Fauquier Co., Virginia. Mountain leather occurs at the Milford quarries, Conn., also at Brunswick, New Jersey. Cummingtonite is from Cummington and Plainfield, Mass. A variety of hornblende, on the island of Corsica, admits of a high polish, and is the Verde de Corsica duro. Asbestus was manufactured into cloth by the ancients, who were acquainted with its incombustibility. This cloth was sometimes the material for napkins ; which could be cleansed by throwing them into the fire. This material was also employed for the wicks of lamps in the ancient temples, and it is now used for the same purpose by the natives of Greenland. The name amianthus was applied to it because of the simplicity of the means of restoring it, when soiled, to its original purity. The best United States locality for collecting it for this purpose is near the quarantine, Richmond Co., New York. It is ex tensively used in making safes. Gedrite. \u2014 Resembles anthophyllite. Dufrenoy obtained Si 3881, Si 9*31, Fe 45*83, Mg 4*13, Ca 0*67, fl 2*30. From Gedr-J in the Pyrenees. Altered Fokms. \u2014 Alterations of Hornblende are mostly like those of Augite. Varieties often contain some water from hydration. (as in analyses 10, 12, 13, etc.) especially asbestiform or anthophyllite varieties. The ferruginous change by oxyd ation is common ; and all varieties are exposed to alteration from infiltrating waters holding carbonates, silicates, etc., in solution, thus giving rise to magnesian, ferruginous, magnesio-ferruginous, (chlorite), alkaline, or aluminous forms. Beck has analyzed hornblende pseudomorphs from Warwick, N. Y., (Am. J. Sci. xlvi, 25) ; and Rammelsberg, another from Madrell, (Pogg. Ixii, 142, and 2nd Suppl. 61.) The so-called Hydrous anthophyllite of Thomson (from New York Island) is an altered asbestiform tremolite. Fresh specimens afforded Smith and Brush as the mean of two analyses, (Am. J. Sci. [2], xvi, 49), gi 58*43, Mg 29*31, Fe 8*76, Na 0*88, Kir., ignition 2-26, Si tr. =99*67, corresponding to the hornblende formula. Thomson found 11*45 percent of water, (Min. i, 209). It occurs also in Scotland. Talc, steatite, serpentine, chlorite, mica, pinite, chabasite, limonite, magnetite, occur as hornblende pseudomorphs. Chabasite, as Bischof observes, has the same oxygen ratio for the bases and silica as hornblende ; but part of the protoxyd of hornblende (the magnesia) is removed and alumina substituted, probably through the results of the decomposition of feldspar in progress at the same time. Groppite, and perhaps Rosite, as L. Saemann has suggested to the author, may be altered Pargasite. Nephrite. Jade.

One specimen in the Royal collection measures 14J- inches long and 12 broad, and weighs 16} pounds troy; another is 7 inches long and 4 broad, and weighs 6 pounds troy. Mount Zalora, in Upper Egypt, affords a less distinct variety, and was the only locality which was known to the ancients. Other localities are Canjargum in Hindostan, and Salzburg, where it is imbedded in mica slate. Pliny speaks of the finest beryls as those \" qui viriditatem puri maris imitantur,\" \u2014 green like the sea, \u2014 and crystals of clear shades of sky-blue, or mountain-green, are hence termed aquamarine. This variety is found in Siberia, Hindostan, and Brazil. In Siberia they occur in the granite district of Nertschinsk, and in the Uralian and Altai ranges of Siberia. They have been obtained exceeding a foot in length, and are commonly striated longitudinally. The most splendid specimen of this variety of which we have any account, belongs to Don Pedro. It approaches in size, and also form, the head of a calf, and exhibits a crystalline structure only on one side ; the rest is water-worn. It weighs 225 ounces troy, or more than 18^ pounds. The specimen is transparent, and without a flaw. Less clear crystals of beryl occur at the Mourne mountains, Ireland, county Down ; rarely at Cairngorum in Aberdeen shire ; at Limoges in France ; Finbo and Broddbo in Sweden ; Pfitscher-Joch, Tyrol ; Bodenmais and Rabenstein in Bavaria, tin mines of Schlackenwald, also in Australia, and elsewhere. Beryls of gigantic dimensions have been found in the United States, at Acworth and Grafton, N. H., and Royalston, Mass. One beryl from Grafton, N. H., weighs 2900 pounds ; it is 32 inches through in one direction and 22 in another transverse, and is 4 feet 3 inches long. Another crystal from this locality, according to Prof. Hubbard, measures 45 inches by 24 in its diameters, and a single foot in length, by calculation weighs 1076 lbs., making it in all nearly 21 tons. At Royalston, one crystal exceeded a foot in length. The smaller crystals are often limpid and a yel lowish variety, forms a gem resembling chrysolite ; the colors are mostly aquama rine, grass-green, and yellowish-green ; one locality is in the southeast part of Royalston, near the school-house, on the land of Mr. Clarke ; the best crystals are imbedded in quartz. A still better is situated 4 miles beyond the old one in South Royalston ; some crystals of a sky-blue color in white quartz are beauti ful. At Barre, Mass., there is a similar locality, though less remarkable; also at Pearl Hill, in Fitchburg, Goshen, and Chesterfield, Ma6s. At Compton, N. H., the beryls are as fine as at Royalston. Albany, in Maine, and Norwich, a few miles above Bethel, towards Waterford, afford fine large beryls with green and black tourmalines ; crystals, often large, are also obtained at Streaked Mountain, with black tourmaline and mica ; at Bowdoinham and Topham of a pale green or yellowish white color in veins of graphic granite; at Georgetown, Parker's Island, at the mouth ofthe Kennebee ; at Wilmot, N. H. ; with modified terminations, (f. 369), at Haddam, Conn., in a feldspar vein in gneiss, on the east side of the river ; the crys tals are limpid at the extremity for about a twelfth of an inch, as indicated by the dotted line in f. 369 ; the chrysoberyl locality affords less interesting specimens ; also the Middletown feldspar quarry, and the granite of Chatham, near the cobalt mine. At Monroe, Conn., beryl occurs in a granite vein, and the crystals often consist nat urally of several pieces separated by plates of quartz, (094). Crystals, some times 10-12 in. long and 1-J in. in diameter, occur with bla% tourmalines at Leip erville and Chester, Penn., Delaware Co. ; also less interesting at, Mineral Hill. The emerald derives its color from the presence of a minute quantity of oxyd of chrome, and beryl from oxyd of iron. The species Dioptase and Pyrosmalite are hom\u0153omorphous with Beryl, and have the same oxygen ratio between the bases and silica, if the water and chlorine be excluded.

Glinkite is greenish chrysolite from a taleose slate, in Perm, Russia, and occurring also in gneiss at Tunaberg with augite and garnet, (Analysis No. 6). Batrachite, from Rinzoni, Tyrol, has the formula of Monticellite ; G.=3*033. Said to have two cleavages meeting at 115\u00b0 and 65\u00b0, and a third diagonal to them. With the fluxes gives the reaction of iron. Scarcely attacked by muriatic acid, but easily gelatinizes with sulphuric acid. Berzelius says that it also forms a jelly with muriatic. Scacchi's Vesuvian variety is easily attacked by the acids. The iron chrysolites are fusible before the blowpipe ; hyalosiderite forms a black mag- netic bead. Others are infusible. Chrysolite is found near Constantinople, at Vesuvius, and the Isle of Bourbon in lavas ; imbedded in obsidian, at Real del Monte in Mexico ; among sand at Expailly in Auvergne, in pale green transparent crystals. Olivine is of frequent occurrence in basalt and lavas. Crystals several inches in length, in greenstone at Unkel, on the Rhine; spheroidal masses at Kapfenstein in Lower Styria ; and at Hecla and Vesuvius, and various volcanic regions. Olivine is common in the lavas and basalt of the Sandwich and other Pacific Islands. It occurs in imbedded grains, and in masses sometimes several inches through in boulders of coarsely crystallized basalt in Thetford and in Norwich, Vermont. Crystals of this species are commonly very fragile, and therefore unfit for an or- namental stone. The word chrysolite is derived from xPv\u00b0\u00b0s> gold a.n(i Xieos> stone, in allusion to its color; hyalosiderite is from ia\\at, glass, and oi-Sijpos, iron.

Altered Forms. \u2014 Alteration of chrysolite, often takes place through the oxyda tion of the iron ; the mineral becomes brownish or reddish-brown and iridescent. It also splits into thin lamin\u00e6 as the change goes on, sometimes so as to resemble a mica. A basalt thus changed was once pointed out to the author as a mica slate, although no further change had taken place than that here mentioned. Chusite and Limbelite are chrysolite more or less altered. The process may end in leaving the cavity of the crystal filled with limonite or red oxyd of iron. Under the action of carbonated waters, the iron is often carried off instead of being peroxydized, and also some of the magnesia is removed at the same time ; and thus may come serpen tine, picrosmine, villarsite, which often retain the crystalline form of chrysolite. A further change may produce steatite and other magnesian species. TEPHROITE, Breithaupt. Dimetric? Massive, with cleavage parallel to the sides of a square or rectangular prism ; also granular.

B.B. ou charcoal infusible, but becomes paler in varieties containing little iron, sometimes showing traces of fusion on the edges. With borax dissolves slowly but perfectly to a transparent glass slightly tinged by iron ; if the glass is saturated it becomes cloudy by flaming. With salt of phosphorus in the open tube, affords fluorine. Chondrodite occurs mostly in granular limestone. It is found near Abo, in the parish of Pargas in Finland, and at Aker and Gulsjo in Sweden ; at Taberg in Wermland; in Saxony; on Loch Ness in Scotland; at Aehmatowsk in the Ural, along with perofskite, and in the mines of Schischimsk with red apatite. The humite occurs at Somma, in ejected masses of a kind of granite rock, along with white olivine, mica, and magnetite. Abundant in the counties of Sussex, N. J., and Orange, N. Y., where it is associa ted with spinel, and occasionally with pyroxene and corundum. At Bryam, orange and straw-colored chondrodite, and also a variety nearly black, occurs with spinel; at Sparta, a fine locality of honey-yellow chondrodite ; a mile to the north of Sparta is the best locality of this mineral in New Jersey. It al60 occurs at Vernon, Lock wood, and Franklin. Chondrodite is abundant in Warwick, Monroe, Cornwall, near Greenwood Furnace, and at Two Ponds, and elsewhere in Orange Co., N. Y. Fine specimens may be obtained on the land of Mr. Houston, near Edenville. It is obtained also at Chelmsford, Mass., along with scapolite; in Harvy's quarry near Chaddsford, Pa., of yellow and orange colors and abundant. It occurs sparingly on the bank of Laidlaw lake in Rossie, N. Y. Abundant in limestone at S. Crosby, Canada \"West, St. Jerome, St. Adele, Gren ville, etc. The name chondrodite is from XovSpos, a grain, alluding to its granular structure.

Polyadelphite of Thomson (anal. 49, 50) is a brownish-yellow garnet from the Franklin Furnace, New Jersey. Garnet occurs imbedded in mica slate, granite, and gneiss, and occasionally in limestone, chlorite slate, serpentine, and lava. The precious garnet occurs in Ceylon, Greenland, and Brazil. Common garnet is met with in dodecahedrons from three to four inches in diameter, at Fahlun in Sweden, Arendal and Kongsberg in Norway, and the Zillerthal ; abundant smaller crystals in mica slate, in the Island of Mull, in Perth and Inverness, Shetland ; green at Schwarzenberg in Saxony. The magnesia- alumina garnet occurs at Aren dal with calc spar ; Melanite in the Vesuvian lavas, and also near Rome ; Grossu larite near the Wilui River in Siberia, etc. Cinnamon stone in masses of consider able size in Ceylon, at Malsjb in Wermland, and at St. Gothard; Romanzovite, a similar variety, at Kimito, Finland; Aplome on the banks ofthe river Lena in Si beria, and at Schwarzenberg in Saxony ; Ouvarovite in emerald-green dodecahe drons, at Bissersk in Russia, with chromic iron. Other localities as above. In New Hampshire at Hanover, small clear crystals in syenitic gneiss ; blood-red dodecahedrons at Franconia, in geodes in massive garnet, with calc spar and mag netic iron; at Haverhill, in chlorite, some 1-J in. in diameter; at Unity, on the estate of J.

In New Jersey, at Franklin, black, brown, yellow, red, and green dode cahedral garnets ; also near the Franklin furnace. In Pennsylvania, in Chester Co., at Pennsbury, fine dark-brown crystals with polished faces, in granite; near Knau ertown at Keims' mine, good aplome in handsome lustrous crystals ; at Chester, brown ; in Concord, color of pyrope ; in Leiperville, red ; at Mineral Hill, fine brown. In Delaware, cinnamon stone in trapezohedrons, at Dixon's quarry, 7 miles from Wilmington. Also at Knife rapids on the Mississippi ; at Marmora, Canada West, dark red, at Grenville a cinnamon-stone. Colophonite forms a large vein in gneiss at Willsboro, Essex Co., N. Y., associated with tabular spar and green coccolite; also at Lewis, ten miles south of Keeseville, Essex Co. The cinnamon stone from Ceylon and the precious garnet are used as gems when large, finely colored, and transparent. The stone is cut quite thin, on account ofi the depth of color, with a pavilion cut below and a broad table above bordered with small facets. An octagonal garnet measuring 8\u00a3 lines by 6\u00a3 haB sold for near $700. Pulverized garnet is sometimes employed as a substitute for emery. The garnet was, in part, the carbunculus of the ancients, a term probably applied also to the spinel and Oriental ruby. The Alabandic carbuncles of Pliny were so called because cut and polished at Alabanda. Hence the name Almandine, now in use. Pliny describes vessels of the capacity of a pint, formedfrom carbuncles, \" non claros ac plerumque sordidos ac semper fulgoris horridi,\" devoid of lustre and beauty of color, which probably were large common garnets. The garnet is supposed also to have been the hyacinth of the ancientB. 25"], [522, "DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. 194 Altered Forms.\u2014 Garnets containing protoxyd of iron, often become rusty and disintegrated through the oxydation of the iron, and sometimes are altered to red iron ore. The action of waters, containing traces of carbonic acid and carbonates and silicates in solution, result in the same changes nearly as with pyroxene, pro ducing at different times, steatite, serpentine, chlorite. The lime in the lime garnets may be taken up by the carbonic acid ofthe waters ; and if magnesia is combined with the carbonic acid (forming a bicarbonate) it may take the place of the lime, and thus giverise to a steatitic pseudomorph, or to a chlorite, if the iron partly remains. Alka line carbonates seldom produce the changes, for alkaline pseudomorphs are rare. An excess of silica is to be expected in analyses, according to Bischof, since part of the bases are often lost through incipient change. Quartz also occurs with the form of garnet.

Klaproth discovered the earth zirconia in this species in 1789. Hyacinth includes the bright colored varieties ; Zirconite the grayish or brownish, frequently rough or opaque. The variety from Ceylon, which is colorless, or has a smoky-tinge, and is therefore sold for inferior diamonds, is sometimes called jargon. Hyacinth occurs in the sand and alluvial deposits of certain rivers in Ceylon ; at Expailly near Le Puy, France; at Ohlapian in Transylvania; Pfitsch in the Tyrol, (1 : 1=123\u00b0 25'. Kobell) ; at Bilin, in Bohemia ; Sebnitz in Saxony ; occasionally in volcanic tufa in Auvergne ; also in Greenland ; in the zircon syenite of Fredericks- varn in Norway ; near Brevig, sometimes called Erdmannite, containing Si 33*43, Zr (with some Fe and Mn) 65*97, ign. 0*70, Berlin, Pogg, lxxxviii, 162 ; at Miask, in the Urals; in the iron mines of Arendal; also in Scotland, at Scalpay in Harris, and in the granite of Criffel in Kircudbrightshire ; at Vesuvius with ryaeo- lite, in white and blue octahedrons ; at Santa Rosa, (Antioquia), New Grenada, in small colorless crystals. In Buncombe Co., N. C, on the road from the Saluda Gap to Asheville, upon the first elevation after passing Green river, crystals are found loose in the soil, and im- bedded in feldspar; in the sands of the gold washings of McDowall Co., N G, (f. 386). In New York, cinnamon-red, at Hall's mine in Moriah, Essex Co., in a vein of quartz ; near the outlet of Two Ponds, Orange Co., with scapolite, pyroxene, and sphene, in crystals sometimes 1 in. in length ; on Deer Hill, a mile southeast of Can- terbury, in the same Co., crystals abundant of a deep brownish-red or black color, and occasionally 1\u00a3 in. in length ; chocolate-brown crystals in Warwick, at the southern base of Mount Eve, in limestone and scapolite; near Amity, and also in Monroe and Cornwall, at several localities, of white, reddish-brown, clove-brown, and black colors; at Diana in Lewis Co., in large brown crystals sometimes 2 in. long, with sphene and scapolite, but rare. In St. Lawrence Co., with apatite at Robinson's in the town of Hammond, near De Long's Mills ; some of the crystals are 1^ in. long, and i inch wide, and they sometimes contain a nucleus of carbonate of lime. Crystals are found also at Rossie, (form I, 1, 3), at Johnsburg, in Warren Co., in New Jersey at Franklin, and in gneiss at Trenton; at Middlebury, Vt. ; at Litchfield, Me. ; near Reading, Pa., in large crystals in magnetic iron ore ; in tal eose slate at Easton, Pa. ; at Grenville, St. Jerome and Mille Isles, Canada ; in the Gold washings of the north fork of the American River and elsewhere in Cali fornia. Hyacinth occurs of sufficient dimensions to be valuable as a gem. It is very doubtful whether the modern hyacinth is one of the stones that were called hyacinth (vriatuaSoj) by the ancients. Jameson seems to have supposed that they applied this name to the amethyst or sapphire. Ostranite, Breit., is a zircon of a grayish-brown color. FromFredericksvarn? Altered Forms. \u2014 Zircon is one of the most unalterable of minerals, as it contains no protoxyds, and only the most insoluble of peroxyds. It however passes to a hydrous state, and is probably acted on by alkaline waters, which attack the silica, and thus \u0152rstedite may have been formed. Malacone, \u0152rstedite and Tach yaphaltite, are probably altered zircon. Malacone, Scheerer, (Pogg. lxii, 436). Dimetric like zircon ; 1 : 1=124\u00b040' to 124\u00b0 57' and 83\u00b0 30'. H.=6*5.

B.B. fuses easily with some intumescence to a translucent yellow globule, and forms with borax a diaphanous glass, tinged with iron. By fusion the specific gravity is reduced to 2*93 \u2014 2*945, according to Magnus, without any change of com position. Cyprine in the reduction flame affords a red pearl from the copper present. Idocrase is attacked by the acids, and after heating wholly dissolves and gelatinizes. A manganesian idocrase from St. Marcel, Piedmont, has a sulphur to honey-yellow color, and gives an amethystine color with borax in the oxydation flame. Idocrase was first observed in the ancient Vesuvian lavas, and was thence called Vesuvian. It has since been met with in serpentine, gneiss, and granular limestone. The Vesuvian idoerase has a hair-brown or olive-green color, and is associated with glassy feldspar, garnet, mica, and nepheline. The crystals from Ala, in the Val di-Brozzo, in Piedmont, are usually transparent and brilliant with a green or brown color, rarely black. Egg, near Christiania, in Norway, the Ural.Wilui river near Lake Baikal, Cziklowa in the Bannat, and Monzoni in the Fassa valley, are other local ities. Sulphur-yellow crystals have been found at Monzoni. A light brown variety occurs in Donegal, Ireland. From Frugard, Finnland, comes the frugardite ; from Gokum what has been called gokumite, and loboite. Liver-brown diverging groups, from Eger in Bohemia, have been called egeran. Crystals of a blue tint, called cyprine, come from near Tellemark, Norway ; the color is attributed to copper. At Phippsburg and Rumford, just below the falls in Maine, in crystals and massive with yellow garnet, pyroxene, <fec, in limestone; also at Parsonsfield, Me., with the same materials, abundant ; also at Poland and Sandford, (fig. 393), Me. ; at Worcester, Mass., in a quartz rock, with garnet, but exhausted; yellowish -brown in crystals at Newtown, N. J., with corundum and spinel; half a mile south of Amity, N. Y., grayish and yellowish-brown crystals, sometimes an inch in diameter, in granular limestone ; also at the village, and a mile east of the village, of yellow, greenish-yellow, and yellowish-brown colors. The Xanthite, which is from this vicinity, is identical in crystallization with common idocrase. Large brownish yellow crystals occur at Clarendon, Canada West, in limestone with brown tour maline. Named from cila, I see, and upturn, mixture, because the crystalline forms have much resemblance to those of some other species. Altered Forms. \u2014 Alterations nearly as in garnet. Crystals from Maine often have the exterior, though still brilliant and glassy, cleavable easily from the part below, and equally so, parallel to all the smaller as well as larger faces, so that a pealed crystal has as brilliant and even planes as before. Idocrase has been ob served altered to steatite and mica. An Egeran, analyzed by Ficinus, (Schrift. Dresd. Min. Ges. i, 235), gave, Silica 43*00, alumina 14*70, peroxyd of iron 2*40, ib. of manganese 4*00, lime 30*00, 6oda 5-33=99-43. It is probably in an altered state, as Rammelsberg infers from the de scription of Ficinus. The carbonic acid detected by Hermann in idocrase from Slatoust, (anal. 18), is evidence of alteration, and this acid and alkaline or earthy carbonates or bi carbonates in solution, are agents by which change is often produced.

It never be comes strictly fibrous, and usually occurs in distinct crystals which are occasionally of large size. The crystals when not glassy, are often rendered opaque externally or throughout by partial alteration, and sometimes have a chalky appearance over the surface, after exposure. The massive varieties have some resemblance to the feldspars. The following are names of so-called varieties. Scapolite (named from imams, a club) or Wernerite includes common grayish and white varieties. Nuttallite is essentially the name ; colors bluish, grayish and dark greenish. Paranthine has included certain compact varieties and crystals of white and pale blue colors. Ekebergite is massive and subfibrous. The distinctions between these varieties are not well defined.

But most of the analyses, as stated above, af ford the ratio 1:2:4. Analyses 1, 2, 6, give more nearly 1 : 2-} : 4. No. 14 corresponds to the ratio 1:3: 4=(iCas-f|Sl) Si=Silica 43*2, alumina 36*8, lime 20*0. Nos. 24, 28, give the ratio 1 : 3 : 6 ; 25 the ratio 1 : 2 : 5 ; 29 the ratio 1 : 34 : 6. Other intermediate ratios are also presented by the analyses ; and even among specimens of the same locality. Thus Bolton alone has afforded to analysts the ratios (approximate) 1:2:4, 1*2:2:4, 1*2:2*25:4, 1:2*5:4, 1:3:6, 1 : 2| : 6, 1 : 3*9 :9, and in one specimen analyzed by v. Rath the species contains potash replacing soda, (see beyond on Altered Forms.) It is obvious that the variations are largely due to alterations of one or two types. The ratio 1 : 2 : 4 is apparently the most prominent of these types, as recognized by Rammelsberg. Von Rath adopts, as a second, the Gouverneur scapolite, with the ratio 1:2:5. Usually found in crystalline rocks, and in granular limestone, most common near its junction with granite; also in beds of magnetic iron, accompanying this rock. In tbe latter situation, scapolite occurs at Arendal, in Norway, and Wermland, in Sweden ; also in fine crystallizations in Pargas, Finland, <fec. At Arendal it is asso ciated with hornblende and garnet in limestone, and occurs in long slender crystals. Wernerite is found in short thick crystals at the same locality. Paranthine occurs in the limestone quarries of Malsjo in Wermland. Other localities as above.

Altered Forms. \u2014 Scapolite is exceedingly liable to alteration ; and many of the analyses appear to have been made upon specimens that have lost part of their bases, so that the silica is in excess. The mineral in its more ordinary change loses its hard ness and lustre. The action of carbonated waters is sufficient to produce this re sult, the carbonic acid taking up the lime ; and by carrying off all the bases, the mineral may be thus reduced to a kaolin. By means of bicarbonate of magnesia in solution, steatite results. By alkaline carbonates in solution, alkalies may be in troduced and lime removed, thus forming mica, algerite, etc., and perhaps zeolites ; and the potash carbonate appears to be able under some circumstances to replace with potash, the soda of a soda silicate, as in algerite. By means of bicarbonate of iron in solution, an oxyd of iron may be introduced, the iron often peroxydizing in the process, and thus comes epidote after scapolite. Atheriastite, Stroganowite, Terenite, as well as Algerite are believed to be altered forms of scapolite. Many of the analyses of scapolite already given, are to some extent of altered forms. The following are of specimens more altered. I. Altered by removal of protoxyd bases, mostly by carbonic acid. H. Altered by addition of oxyd of iron or magnesia without potash, and partial removal of bases. I III.

The varying results of analyses, and the pre sence of carbonate of lime, of magnesia, and the relations to known examples of al tered scapolite, confirm the view derived from the form and appearances, that Al gerite is an altered Scapolite. The yellow scapolite of Bolton examined by v. Rath (anal. 11) is a similar compound. It has H.=4-5, andG.=2-787; massive\", with perfect rectangular cleavages.

Rath), 1 : 5*6 : 10*5; perhaps 1:6: 10\u00a3, giving 1 : 1\u00a3 for the oxygen of the bases and silica. The change from scapolite has consisted in the removal of lime, addition of Pe, and substitution of potash for soda. The Pargas mica pseudo morph is a magnesian mica. Steatite pseudomorphs, formed by the substitution of magnesia, for other prot-"], [533, "SILICATES, GARNET SECTION. 205 oxyd bases, occur at Newton, in New Jersey, and Arendal in Norway. Nos. 6, 9, 12, 15, are examples of change in this direction. A specimen of Esmarkite, according to L. S\u00e6mann (private communication) given to Mr. Daubree of Paris by M. Esmark, has the rectangular cleavages of scapolite, and is probably an altered form of this species. Two different minerals appear therefore to be confounded under this name. The analyses were made upon a min eral resembling hydrous iolite (see under Iolite) and not on the scapolite mineral. MELLILITE, F. de Bellevue. Humboldtilite, Monticelli and Covelli.

B.B. fuses on thin edges and swells up, but does not easily liquefy, the varieties containing most iron being most fusible ; glass with borax colored by iron. The manganesian variety fuses readily with intumescence ; glass with borax amethyst ine in the exterior flame. In acids the varieties are but partially decomposed, except after a strong heating. The specific gravity changes with heating. An Arendal specimen examined by Rammelsberg, (No. 15 above), had G.=3*403 before heating, 3*271 after heating. Most specimens of epidote afford a minute globule of tin before the blowpipe. Arendal, in Norway, affords fine crystals, whence the name Arendalite.

Bucklandite is from Achmatowsk, Arendal, and Lake Laaeh. Puschkinite is from west of the Urals, north of Katherinenburg. Thulite is from Souland in Tellemark, Norway, and also the iron mine near Klodeberg, Norway ; specific gravity of the former 3*1 \u2014 3*2, of the latter 334. The manganesian variety occurs at St Marcel, in the valley of Aosta, in Piedmont. At Franconia, N. H., both crystallized and granular epidote are abundant, the latter containing magnetic iron. Large crystals of unusual beauty are obtained at Haddam, Conn. Also in crystals at the gneiss quarries of Hadlyme and Chester ; in limestone at Newbury, Mass. ; in greenstone near Nahant ; in hornblende slate at Rowe, Mass, ; fine crystallizations in syenitic gneiss, at Athol, Mass., two miles southwest, ofthe centre of the town; at Warren, N.

Bradford ; very com- mon in the Lake Superior copper region, as a rock, and veinstone, the latter on the Ontanagon ; at the Norwich mine it' occurs beautifully radiated, with quartz and native copper. Zoisite, or gray epidote, in columnar masses, is found at Willsboro', Vt. ; at Montpelier, of a bluish-gray color, associated with calc spar in mica slate ; at Chester, Mass., in mica slate ; also at Goshen, Chesterfield, Hinsdale, Heath, Leyden, Williamsburg, and Windsor in Massachusetts, and at Milford, Conn. ; in Pennsylvania in West Bradford and West Goshen, Chester Co. ; also in Kennet township and East Marlboro. Altereo Forms. \u2014 Epidote is less liable to alteration than most other silicates, and partly because the iron it contains is mainly peroxyd. Hermann found car bonic acid in several epidotes, an evidence of partial alteration ; and J. D.

Rammelsberg has examined the orthite of Hitteroe, with special reference to its proportion of iron oxyds, (Pogg. lxxvi, 96), and corrects analysis 15 as follows: Si 33*81, Si 13*04, Fe 8*16, Fe 8*30, Ce 20*50, Y 1*45, Ca 9*42, Mg 0*38, K 0*67, fl 3*38=99*11, which gives, excluding the water, the formula above. The water amounts to 1 fl, with this formula. The same composition is derived from Her- mann's analysis, No. 19. B.B. Allanite fuses with intumescence, to a dark glass or slag, sometimes magnetic. Cerine fuses easily. Orthite fuses slowly to a black blebby glass. Reaction of iron with the fluxes, and with soda a manganese reaction. Uralorthite inturnesces, often very easily, and fuses on the edges to a black blebby glass. Some allanites, and also some orthites, gelatinize with acids ; others are imper- fectly decomposed. Uralorthite is dissolved in acids, somewhat gelatinizing. These varieties occur in albitic and common feldspathic granite, zireon-syenite, porphyry, and white limestone. Allanite occurs in Greenland, in granite; at Jotun Fjeld in Norway, in a kind of porphyry, and at Snarum in albite, along with rutile and apatite ; at Plauensche Griind, near Dresden ; in granite near Suhl in the Thii ringer waid. The Allanite from Jotun Fjeld gelatinizes with acids, while that from Snarum is not affected by acids ; Cerine occurs at Bastnas in Sweden with hornblende and copper pyrites. Orthite occurs in acicular crystals sometimes a foot long at Finbo near Fahlun, and at Ytterby in Sweden ; at Skeppsholm near Stockholm, in black vitreous masses disseminated through gneiss ; also at Kragerbe, Hitteroe and Fille Fjeld in Norway, at Miask in the Ural ; at Dresden. The name is derived from opdos, straight. Uralorthite occurs with small crystals of zircon in flesh-red feldspar at Miask in the Ural. In the United States in large crystals in Allen's vein at the gneiss quarries, Had- dam, Conn. ; in small crystals at the Bolton quarry, Mass. ; at South Royalston in boulders; at Athol on the road to Westminster in gneiss; in a feldspathic rock in tabular crystals near West Point, and of similar character near Bay St. Paul, in Canada ; in S. Mountain near Bethlehem, Pa., in crystals sometimes as large as the hand ; in New Jersey, near Moriah, at Sandford ore bed. A massive pitch-black mineral from Monroe, Orange Co., N. Y. ; a similar variety is found at East Brad ford, Chester Co., Pa. ; G.=3*5, (Anal. 5); at St. Paul's, Canada West. With Allanite belong probably Bodenite, (Breith. Pogg. lxii, 273, Kersten, ib. lxiii, 135, Kerndt, 3. f. pr. Chem xliii, 219), and Muromontite, (Kerndt, 3. f. pr. Chem xliii, 228). Bodenite occurs in long prismatic crystals, apparently rhombic, with I: 7=110\u00b0 \u2014 112\u00b0. H.=6 \u2014 6*5. G.=2*523.

They often contain carbonic acid. It is probable that the carbonates of lanthanum and of cerium proceed at times from the alteration of allanite. ZOISITE, (in part.)

With borax in the outer flame, or with salt of phosphorus, a transparent glass, light yellow, hot, colorless cold. This species was separated from Epidote on crystallographic grounds by Brooke, in 1831, and is so published by Brooke and Miller. But only the analyses of the so-called Zoisite specimens from the Saualp in Carinthia by Klaproth are recog nized by these authors as belonging certainly to the species. It does not appear to include all the lime-epidotes, as thulite, peculiarly a lime-variety, has the form and cleavage of epidote, and is placed with that species by Brooke and Miller. We therefore leave the other analyses under epidote until the subject is further inves tigated. Klaproth's analyses lead nearly to the formula Ca3Si+3 Si Si=(|Ca3-| fSl)Si=Silica 43*2, alumina 36*8, lime 20*0. The rest give the formula of epidote. Other localities mentioned by Brooke and Miller are Sterzing in the Tyrol, Fern leite in Fusch in Salzburg, Baireuth, Conradsreuth near Hof in Bavaria, and the Ural. Mr. Brooke observes that the form is near that of Euclase. GADOLINITE. Gadolinit, W. Ytterbyte. Monoclinic; rarely in crystals, with uneven faces.

Of Berlin's analyses, the first two were of the glassy gadolinite ; the others, ex cepting the last, did not present the glow of light when heated. B.B. decrepitates and swells into cauliflower-like masses, but does not fuse into a bead ; in the progress of the heat it exhibits a vivid glow, and the color becomes paler. With borax a dark glass deeply colored with iron, bottle-green in the\" re ducing flame. Acted on by salt of phosphorus with great difficulty. A variety less glassy in appearance does not exhibit the glow on heating. Gelatinizes in mu riatic acid. Gadolinite occurs principally in the quarries of Korarfvet and Finbo, near Fahlun, in Sweden ; also at Ytterby, near Stockholm ; at each place indistinctly crystal lized, and in rounded masses, which are often encircled with a yellow crust, and imbedded in coarse-grained granite. At Korarfvet crystals have been obtained four inches long. It has also been met with at Disko in Greenland ; in trap near Galway, Ireland ; imbedded in granite in Ceylon ; at Finbo and Broddbo, and at Krageroe and Hitteroe in the southern part of Norway, crystals sometimes four inches across and twins at this last locality.

Altered Forms.\u2014 -The alteration of iolite takes place so readily by ordinary ex posure, that the mineral is most commonly found in an altered state, or enclosed in the altered iolite. This change may be a simple hydration, (Fahlunite, etc.) ; or a removal of part of the protoxyd bases by carbonic acid ; or the introduction of oxyd of iron through carbonate of iron ; or of alkalies through waters containing alkaline carbonates, forming Pinite and mica; the first step in the change consists in a division of the prisms of iolite into plates parallel to the base, and a foliation of the surfaces of these plates ; as the alteration proceeds, the foliation becomes more complete, but afterwards it is often lost.

But Senarmont in his recent investigations has shown that mono- clinic forms do not exist. He argues this from the fact that no twins have been observed in which the terminal faces are inclined to one another, while they are common parallel to the prismatic planes with these faces in one and the same plane, as observable by optical means when not otherwise apparent. It is well known that slight admixtures of foreign ingredients change greatly the axes of polarization ; moreover the same plate often varies several degrees in the apparent optical angle in different parts. But notwithstanding the variations thus occasioned, there is still a wide interval between the common micas and the phlogopites, the former varying in the angle between the apparent axes, from 45\u00b0 to 78\u00b0, the latter, not exceeding 20\u00b0. The following are the results of the examinations of micas by Silliman, Jr., (Am. J. Sci., [2], x, 372, and Senarmont, (Ann. de Ch. et de Phys. [3], xxxiii, 391, xxxiv, 171.

This biaxial character, however, has been attributed by some to the lamellar structure of the mica. But Dove has recently shown by a new method, (Berichter Acad. Berlin, April, ] 853), that they are actually biaxial, and they are so regarded by Senar mont. The greenish-black mica of Monroe, analyzed by von Kobell, is an example. Mr. W. P.

The following are some of these darker varieties : a dark green by transmitted light, from Sussex Co., N. Y. ; another from Middletown, Ct. ; another from New York Island. According to investigations thus far made, the muscovites vary in the apparent inclination of the axes between 44\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 ; the phlogopites be tween 5\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 ; the biotites range below 5\u00b0. Silliman, Jr., observes that the muscovites are confined to granitic and other igneous rocks, while the phlogopites are exclusively found in granular limestone and serpentine.

In analyses 2 to 6 the oxygen of the protoxyds, peroxyds, and silica has the ratio 1 : 12 : 16; or as nearly 1 : 12 : 16J, which gives for the oxygen ratio for the bases and silica 4 : 5, and affords the above formula. The Abborforss mica (No. 7) gives closely the ratio 2 : 9 : 12. Analysis No. 8 has nearly the ratio 1 : 9 : 12. The formula corresponding would be (AS\u00bb-hr%K)Si\u00b0. B.B. fuses with some difficulty to a grayish-yellow blebby glass. Dissolves easily with borax and salt of phosphorus, leaving with the last a silica skeleton. The variety composed of scales arranged in plumose forms is called plumose mica ; and that with a diagonal cleavage, prismatic mica. Mica is one of the constituents of granite, and its associate rocks, gneiss, syenite, and mica slate. It also occurs in more recent aggregate rocks ; also in imbedded crystals in granular limestone, wacke, trachyte, and basalt. Coarse lamellar aggre gations often form the matrix of crystals of topaz, tourmaline, and other mineral species. The Fuchsite is a green mica from Schwarzenstein in the Tyrol. Siberia affords lamin\u00e6 of mica, sometimes exceeding a yard in diameter ; and other remarkable foreign localities are at Finbo in Sweden, and Skutterud in Norway. Fine crystallizations of mica occur in granite at Acworth, Grafton, and Alstead, N. H., and the plates are at times a yard across and perfectly transparent; also at Paris and Streaked Mountain, Maine. In Massachusetts, at Chesterfield with tour maline and Albite. Barre and South Royalston, in two localities with beryl, and at Mendon and Brimfield ; at Chester, Hamden Co., Mass., faint greenish. A green variety occurs at Unity, Me., on the estate of James Neal ; and prismatic mica at Russell, Mass. In Connecticut, at Monroe of a dusky brown color, having internal hexagonal bands of a darker shade ; in brown hexagonal crystal at the Middletown feldspar quarry; at Haddam, pale brownish, with columbite, and also similar at another locality with garnets. Six miles southeast of Warwick, N. Y, crystals and plates sometimes a foot in diameter, in a vein of feldspar ; a mile northwest of Edenville in six-sided and rhombic prisms ; silvery, near Edenville ; in St. Law rence Co., eight miles from Potsdam, on the road to Pierrepont, mica is found in plates seven inches across ; town of Edwards in large prisms, six-sided or rhombic ; Greenfield, near Saratoga, in reddish-brown crystals with chrysoberyl ; on the"], [551, "223 SILICATES, MICA SECTION. Croton acqueduet near Yonkers, in rhombic prisms with a transverse cleav age. In Pennsylvania, in fine hexagonal crystals of a dark brown color at Pennsbury near Pennsville, Chester Co. ; in Philadelphia Co. on the rail road near Philadelphia, smoky brown with hexagonal internal bands ; at Chesnut Hill near the Wissahiccon, a green variety; at Leiperville, Delaware Co., faint greenish ; in New Jersey, crystals are obtained at Newtown and Franklin. In Maryland, at Jones's Falls, a mile and three (Quarters from Baltimore ; the plates show by transmitted light a series of concentric hexagons, the sides of which are parallel with the sides of a hexagonal prism. Other localities are given on pages 218 to 220. Thomson has analyzed (Min. i, 360) a mica reported from Orange Co., N. Y., and stated to be in \" fine rhomboidal prisms,\" and obtained Si 49*38, Al 23*67, Fe 7*31, K 15-29, Ca 6*13, Li 0*06=101 -89, affording the oxygen ratio 1:3: 6=RSi+RSi, corresponding to some Lithia micas. Another mica from Chamouni, (probably biaxial, but not fully ascertained), af forded Delesse, (Ann. Ch. Phys.

Altered Forms. \u2014 Mica at times becomes hydrated, losing its elasticity and trans parency, and often some portion of the alkalies and oxyd of iron. Margarodite. \u2014 It is possible that Margarodite (analyses 6 to 11 below) may result from a change of this kind ; it is a change in the oxygen ratio for the protoxyds, per oxyds and silica from 1 : 12 : 16*25 to 2 : 12 : 17*5, with the addition of some water, a change due partly to the added water, and perhaps partly also to the addition of magnesia and soda, as the analyses afford more soda and magnesia than exist in Muscovite. The formula corresponding to the above ratio is (-7R3-fyS)Si'. In appearance, and optical characters, this Mica resembles Muscovite ; but it is much more pearly or silvery and less transparent and elastic ; and it is often in radiated ag gregations of scales er plates, a condition which would expose the mineral espe cially to alteration.

Gilbertitc, (Anal. 4, 5), also is probably hydrous museovite ; it gives the oxygen ratio 1-aJ- : 12 : 16, near some museovite ; but it has lost the alkalies or part of them. H.=2*75. G.=2*648. It is from Stonagwyn, St. Just, Cornwall. Damourite of Delesse, appears also to be a Margarodite, and perhaps a hydrous Muscovite. The analysis corresponds to the formulaJ^LR'+^fij'Si 5 +}fl. It has a scaly texture, a pearly lustre, yellow or yellowish-white color, and occurs associated with kyanite, at Pontivy, in Brittany. Sericite of K. List, is regarded by him as near Damourite. H.=l.

Mica also occurs altered to Steatite or Serpentine, through the action of bicarbon ate or silicate of magnesia in infiltrating waters. A hydrous mica (Wasserglimmer, Morin, Ann. d. M.

The mica from Greenwood Furnace, Monroe, N.

This is the same mica with that analyzed by Smith and Brush, (anal. 13, 14), as Mr. Brush has assured himself by an examination of von Kobell's specimens at Munich. It is the Rhombenglimmer of Kengott, (Pogg. lxxiii, 661). In composition it is true biotite. The Vesuvian biotite occurs in brilliant crystals, (Meroxene). A brownish-green biotite with a waxy structure and soapy feel, (anal. 15), occurs in Putnam Co., N. Y. G.=2*80. One of the \"uniaxial\" micas of Biot is stated to have come from Topsham, Maine. Altered Forms. \u2014 Rubellan is considered an altered_biotite ; it occurs in small hexagonal forms, of a red color, in a kind of wacke. Steatite is also a result of the alteration of this species, as in granite at Brunn and Thierscheira. Among the above analyses, several indicate incipient change, by the water and chlorine present. The mica of Putnam Co., N. Y., has even a soapy feel and is inelastic. Mica alter ed to Magnetite has also been observed in the Tyrol. LEPIDOLITE. Lithia Mica. Lithion-glimmer. Lithionite, Kob.

Traces of muriatic acid, and also of sulphuric, were detected by Scheerer and Bromeis ; and in one nepheline from Mt. Somma they found 0*22 of the former and 0*10 of the latter. B.B. nepheline fuses with difficulty to a vesicular glass. Dissolves slowly with borax. With cobalt solution a grayish-blue color on the fused edge. El\u00e6olite fuses easily. In acids easily gelatinize. Nepheline occurs in crystals in the older lavas of Vesuvius, with mica, idocrase, <fec. ; also at Capo di Bove, near Rome, and in the clinkstone of Katzenbuckel, near Heidelberg. El\u00e6olite comes from Brevig, Stavern, and Fredericksvarn, Norway, where it is found imbedded in zircon-syenite ; also from Ilmengebirge in Siberia, along with white feldspar, brown hexagonal mica, zircon, pyrochlore, &e. The crystal measured by Scacchi was of the variety Sommite, or Davyne, occurring at Somma in a geode in limestone with sodalite. El\u00e6olite occurs massive and crystallized at Litchfield, Me., with cancrinite ; in the Ozark Mts., Arkansas, with brookite and schorlomite. The name nepheline is derived from pcipeXrj, a cloud, and alludes to the action in acids ; and el\u00e6olite is from cXaiov, oil, in allusion to its greasy lustre. Altered Forms. \u2014 Nepheline or El\u00e6olite is liable to ready alteration, and usually produces a zeolite, as natrolite, (Bergmannite), or Thomsonite. The Ozarkite of Shepard, according to Smith and Brush, is Thomsonite, and its situation in cavities in el\u00e6olite shows that it is a product of alteration. The large amount of soda in nepheline compared with the silica, fits it especially for generating zeolites. The relation of Bergmannite to El\u00e6olite was shown by Blum, (Pogg. lxxxvii, 315.) Gieseckite is shown by Blum to be a pseudomorph after this species. It differs mainly in containing 4*88 per cent, of water. It occurs in six-sided greenish gray prisms of greasy lustre. Blum also considers Leibenerite a similar pseudomorph. El\u00e6olite has also been observed altered to Mica. CANCRINITE, G. Rose.

Amphodelite [fr. o/ii(5a), both, and oSc\\os, a spear] is a reddish gray or dingy peach blossom-red variety, occurring crystallized and massive, with the angle 0 : i?=85\u00b0 40', and cleavage parallel to O and il. Indianite has a granular texture somewhat like statuary marble, a glistening surface of fracture, and occurs massive. The grains cleave parallel to two planes inclined to one another 84\u00b0 45', which is not far from the angle of anorthite, considering the difficulty in this case of obtaining perfectly accurate measurement. Anorthite (Biotine) occurs at Mount Vesuvius, among the old lavas in the ravines of Monte Somma, associated with ice spar, augite, mica, and idocrase. Also on the island of Procida near the entrance to the bay of Naples ; in the Faroe Islands, and Java. Amphodelite occurs at Lojo, Finland, and at Tunaberg, Sweden. The Lepolite from Lojo and Orrijerfvi, is the same mineral ; the crystals are sometimes two inches long ; and Linseite is probably the same partly altered, containing a few per cent, of water. The Indianite is from the gangue of the corundum in the Carnatic, and is associated with garnet, kyanite, and hornblende. The specimen analyzed by G. J. Brush, was originally from the hands of Count Bournon, and came from the Indian locality.

When pulver ized, entirely dissolved by heated muriatic acid, which does not attack either feld spar or albite. Labradorite is a constituent of some lavas, as those of Etna and Vesuvius ; of many porphyries, as the oriental verd antique of Greece, (analysis 12), and other varieties ; of dolerite ; certain hornblende rocks, granites, and syenites ; of some porphyritic greenstones, as at Campsie, Scotland ; of melaphyres, as in the Tyrol, (analysis 13). On the coast of Labrador, whence it was originally brought, it is associated with hornblende, hypersthene, and magnetic iron ore. It has been found in place at Mille Isles, Canada, also in Morin, Abercrombie and elsewhere. It occurs abundantly at Essex Co., N. Y. Large boulders are met with in the towns of Mo riah, Newcomb, M'Intyre, Westport, and Lewis, N. Y. ; also occasionally in Orange, Lewis, St. Lawrence, Warren, Scoharie, and Green counties. In Pennsylvania, at Mineral Hill, Chester Co., and opposite New Hope, Bucks Co. The Scolexerose and Anhydrous Scolecite are from Pargas, Finland ; the Silicite is from Antrim, Ireland. Scolexerose has been referred to scapolite. Labradorite receives a fine polish, and owing to the chatoyant reflections, the specimens are often highly beautiful. It is sometimes used in jewelry. Vosgite of Delesse (Ann. d. M. [4], xii, 284) appears to be a Labradorite render ed hydrous by partial alteration, as stated by Rammelsberg.

B.B. fuses with difficulty, and only on the edges, to a semi-transparent blebby glass. With borax forms slowly a transparent glass, and with soda a vesicular glass. Not acted on by the acids. With cobalt solution, becomes blue only on the fused edges. Difference of color and lustre has given rise to distinct names for several varie ties of this species. Common Feldspar or Orthoclase [fr. opfloj, straight or rectangular, and icXau, to cleaves includes the subtranslucent varieties, the common constituent of granite. Loxoclase, Breit., has the composition of orthoclase as shown by Smith and Brush, and does not differ essentially in cleavage ; the basal and clinodiagonal being much the most distinct ; I: /about 120\u00b0; G.=2*6\u2014 2*62, Plattner. Necronite [fr. icupas, a corpse] gives off a fetid odor when struck. Adularia is a transparent or translucent variety, found in granitic rocks. The crystals are often large, and occur of great perfection in the high districts of Savoy ; the name is derived from Adula, one of the highest peaks of St. Gothard. The Valencianite of Breithaupt is a variety of adularia ; the name is from the Mexican mine Valenciana. Moonstone is a variety of adularia, presenting, when polished, chatoyant or pearly reflections. Sunstone is a similar variety, containing minute scales of oxyd of iron, or Gothite, (Kengott), disseminated through it. The opalescence is seen in the direction of a plane replacing the edge I: I somewhat obliquely. But neither of these are exclusively common feldspar. A Siberian sunstone has been shown by Scheerer to be oligoclase; and the moonstone of Mineral Hill, Delaware Co., Pa., is of the same species."], [573, "SILICATES, FELDSPAR SECTION. 245 Aventurine Feldspar is less pellucid, and has yellow and reddish internal re flections. Glassy Feldspar is a transparent variety found in traehytie and volcanic rocks having a perfect vitreous lustre. It has been called Sanidin, from aams, a board, the crystals being tabular ; and according to Naumann,it has C=68\u00b0 55'. 0 : 7=110\u00b0 0 : I'=115\u00b0. The name Ice Spar is sometimes given to a similar variety found in Vesuvian lavas ; the term however includes pellucid varieties of other species of feldspar. Other varieties are the Murchisonite of Levy, [named after Murchison, the Geol ogist], which is a yellowish-gray or flesh-red variety from Heavitree, near Exeter \u2022 Amazon stone, a verdigris-green variety colored by copper, from Lake Ilmen ; the Leelite of Dr. Clarke, (the Hellefiinta of the Swedes), which occurs at Gryphyttan in Sweden, with a peculiar waxy lustre, and deep flesh-red color ; and the Vario lite, a dark green variety, containing lighter globular particles, from river Drac in France. Kaolin is a term applied to a clay resulting from the decomposition of feldspar. (See beyond.) The Microcline [fr. pi\u00abpos, little, arXirta), to incline] of Breithaupt, is a variety of this species from Arendal, (Pogg. xlvii, 196). The Erythrite [fr. cpvBpos, red] of Thomson (Phil. Mag. xxii, 188, 1843) is a flesh-colored feldspar, containing three per cent, of magnesia, found in amygdaloid ; G.=2*541. The Perthite of Thomson is from Perth, in Upper Canada. Rhyacolite of Rose, (or Ryacolite), from Vesuvius, [named from pvaf, a lava stream], has the crystallization of feldspar, and resembles the glassy variety. G. Rose states (Kryst. Chem. Min. 88, 1852) that he suspects that in his analysis (Pogg. xxviii, 143) some nepheline may have been mixed with the feldspar, as they often occur together at the locality, and he therefore does not mention it as a distinct species in this recent work oPhis. Feldspar in fine crystals is found at Carlsbad and Elnbogen in Bohemia, (twins, \u00a3 424, 425). Ekatherinenburg in Siberia, Arendal in Norway, Baveno in Piedmont, Lomnitz in Silesia, Land's End, &c, are other localities. At the Mourne mountains in Ireland, fine specimens occur, associated with beryl and topaz. Glassy feldspar occurs in great abundance in the trachyte of the Drachenfels on the Rhine ; also in the lavas which devastated the island of Ischia, near Naples, in 1302. Ice spar is found principally at Vesuvius ; it may be obtained in profusion in the valley call ed Fossa Grande. Fine crystallized feldspar occurs in New York, in St. Lawrence Co.^i^JJssie, two miles north of Oxbow ; tl rystals are white or bluish- white, y-J^k Himes an inch across; also miles from Potsdam, on the road to I'i. Tra-i^WI^'hi re crys- tals a foot through are said to have been found; and near DeLoufl^^iills in the town of Hammond, with apatite and zircon, where the Loxoclase^Btspz&ined ; in Lewis Co., feldspar occurs both crystallized and massive in white Milestone near Natural Bridge, with scapolite and sphene ; in Orange Co., crysffils near West Point; more abundant and interesting forms are found at Rocky Hill, in Warwick, with tourmaline and zircon; and at Amity and Edenville. In Saratoga Co.,_N. Y., at the Greenfield chrysoberyl locality, white translucent crystals, usually coated with silvery mica. In Connecticut at the gneiss quarries of Haddam and the feld- spar quarries of Middletown, crystals a foot long, and six or eight inches thick ; near Bradleysville, in the western part of Litchfield, crystals 2-3 inches long, abundant. In Massachusetts at South Royalston and Barre, in crystals often large ; also at Three Rivers, in Palmer. The Acworth beryl locality, the tourmaline local- ity of Paris, Maine, are other localities of crystallized feldspar. In Pennsylvania, in crystals at Leiperville, Mineral Hill, and Chester, (chesterlite), Delaware Co. ; a sunstone in Kennett Township ; fine crystals of green feldspar occur on the island, Mt. Dessert, Me. Washington Mine, Davidson Co., N. C, in white and yellowish crystals, (anal. 19). Massive feldspar is abundant at the above mentioned localities, besides many others. An aventurine variety, with bright coppery reflections in spots, occurs at Leiperville Pennsylvania. Adularia occurs at the Falls of the Yantic, near Nor-"], [574, "246 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. wich, Conn., at Brimfield, Mass., with iolite, and <it Parsonfield, Me. ; and sunstone atLyme, Conn. (Some of these may be oligoclase). Kaolin occurs at Andover, Mass., and abundantly in New Milford, Kent, and Cornwall, Conn., and in the counties of Essex and Warren, New York; also in New Garden, Chester Co., Pa., abundant. Neeronite is found at Roger's Rock, Essex Co., and at Thomson's quarry, near 196th street, New York. Chesterlite (anal. 20, 21) is shown by Smith and Brush to have the constitution of Orthoclase. It occurs in crystals sometimes 1\u00a3 inches broad, implanted often on dolomite. Faces not polished ; I: I' =121\u00b0 \u2014 127\u00b0. 0 : ii=90\u00b0 as shown by twins; 0 : I and 0 : T unequal, (as also 2i on / and 2i on T), but not constant, and the difference may be an irregularity.

Twins common parallel to 0 : also a peculiar twin, in general form rectangular, made by composition parallel both to 0 and i), the latter composition shown by the meeting of stri\u00e6 along the middle of 0, and the former by a similar meeting on ii ; but it is singular that in the two specimens observed by the author (from the cabinet of Joel Baily) this meeting of stri\u00e6 is seen on only one of the planes 0, and one ii ; on the other plane 0 the stri\u00e6 extend across, parallel to the inter section of 0 with one of the planes /, a fact that indicates a dielinic rather than a monoclinic form. The crystals normally would have 4 planes /at one extremity ; but the specimens are partly broken and only two are present on one side, one above the other. Feldspar enters into the composition of a great number of rocks. Granite consists of feldspar, quartz, and mica, crystallized promiscuously togeth er. The feldspar constitutes ordinarily about 40 per cent., but varies very widely ; while the quartz is usually 30 to 40 per cent. Ordinary granite contains about 72*3 silica, 15*3 alumina, 7*4 of alkalies, 5*0 of lime, magnesia, and oxyd of iron, \u2014 a composition near that of petrosilex. Pegmatite is graphic granite. Gneiss has the same ingredients as granite, but with traces of lamination. Mica slate is similar in constitution, with a distinctly foliated structure. Beresite is a finegrained granite, containing pyrites, from near Beresof, in the Ural. Syenite consists of feldspar, hornblende, and quartz, and otherwise resembles granite. These rocks pass into one another by insensible gradations. Protogine is a talc granite. Dolerine is a gneissoid rock in the Alps consisting of talc and feldspar. Granulite, Eurite, or Leptynite, (Weissstein), is a granular compound of feldspar and quartz, with sometimes garnet. The Hornfels of the Germans is a massive compound of quartz and feldspar breaking with a smooth flinty fracture. The Cornubianite is similar. Pyroxenite consists of feldspar and lamellar-pyroxene. Pyromeride is a granitoid rock containing spherules thickly disseminated. Simi lar spherules sometimes occur in porphyry, trachyte, eurite, diorite, and occasion ally granite. Delesse has shown that rocks containing these spherules have an ex cess of silica. The spherules are feldspathic, but contain mixed quartz which is most abundant in the exterior coats or at the centre. Miascite, a granular slaty rock consisting of orthoclase, mica, and el\u00e6olite, with sometimes quartz, albite, and hornblende. Porphyry consists of a compact feldspathic base, (cornite or porphyrite), with crystals of feldspar, (often orthoclase or oligoclase) ; it may be green with blotches of paler green or white, or red with white blotches or specks, besides other shades of color ; the blotches of a polished surface are the feldspar crystals. When distinct feldspar crystals are scattered through granite it is called porphyritic granite. The feldspar of porphyry is often also the species labradorite, as is the case in the ancient verd antique porphyry of Greece, quarried from rounded hills on the plains of Helosin, Laconia. In the porphyry of Ternuay in the Vosges it is the species vos gite. It is often quartzose or gl obuliferous. Clinkstone or phonolite is a compact feldspathic rock of grayish colors and smooth fracture, clinking under the hammer when struck somewhat like a metal. G.=2*5 \u20142*6. Trachyte is a rock of similar constitution and color with clinkstone, but having a rough surface of fracture. Domite is a grayish earthy variety from Puy-de Dome. Pumice (Bimsstein, German) is a porous feldspathic scoria from volcanoes ; the pores are fine and linear and often barely visible without a glass. G.=2*2 \u2014 2*4."], [575, "SILICATES, FELDSPAR SECTION. 247 Trap or greenstone is a dark and heavy blaekish-green or brownish rock consist ing of feldspar and hornblende ; it usually has a crystalline texture, but 'is some times compact. When albite replaces orthoclase the rock is called diorite. Basalt or dolerite is a similar rock, consisting of feldspar (often labradorite) and augite, either subcrystalline or not at all so, and often containing distinct crystals of augite or feldspar or both, and still more frequently chrysolite in bottle-glass colored grains, with also grains of magnetic iron. It passes into lavas, which often have the same constitution and are of the same origin. Anamesite is a very fine granu lar rock of similar constitution, in which the labradorite predominates. Wacke is an earthy variety, or a rock consisting of basaltic earth or sand.* * In the analysis of basalt, it is subjected to the action of nitric or muriatic acid, and thus separated into a soluble and insoluble portion. The basalt of Wicken stein, thus examined by Lowe, with muriatic acid, afforded him 55*58 per cent, of insoluble product, and 44*42 of soluble, the latter consisting of 39*81 of zeolite or zeolitic minerals, and 4*61 of magnetic iron. The basalt from Stolpen, according to Sinding, consists of 57*736 per cent, soluble in muriatic acid, and 42*264 insoluble.

According to Girard, who analyzed the same basalt with some what different results, it is a mixture of mesolite and nepheline. The rest of the basalt, excluding the magnetic iron, is augite, and, according to Girard, the whole consists of mesotype 22*686, nepheline 22*686, magnetic iron 6*370, augite 48*256. The Stolpen basalt is inferred from the analysis, to consist of zeolite 74*837, olivine 12*630, magnetic iron 13*318. The zeolite is supposed to be a mixture of several zeolitic minerals; it approaches, in composition, mesole, brevicite, and sodalite. A Dolerite from Iceland, analyzed by Auerbach, gave labradorite 38*18 per cent. and augite 61*82. Girard shows that the only difference between the so-called do lerite and the basalt of Meissner is that the latter contains zeolites.

A greenish-gray specimen from Brittany afforded Berthier, Silica 75*4, alumina 15*5, potash 3*8, magnesia 1*4, oxyd of iron 1-2.

Obsidian or volcanic glass is sometimes an impure feldspar in a glassy state ; and in other eases it is a mixture of feldspar and augite with chrysolite and much iron, or of augite and chrysolite or labradorite, &c, the materials varying with the lavas of a volcano ; for any lava will become glassy, and thus make obsidian, by rapid cooling.

Pole's Hair (anal. 12) has the composition of an augite, (Rammelsberg). Altered Fokms. \u2014 Feldspar may be altered through infiltrating waters carrying more or less carbonic acid in solution, (Forchhammer, Fournet, Bischof); also through the action of waters rendered acid by the deeompositio nos pyrites, (Mits cherlich); also by ordinary waters holding traces of alkaline and other ingredients in solution, (Bischof). The presence of pyrites, or a mineral containing protoxyd of iron, as some mica, garnet, (fee, is often the first occasion of the change. The decomposition of the mineral with the attendant oxydation of the iron distributes ferruginous waters through the rook, (or sulphate of iron, from the altered sulphuret), and thus by a disaggregating or decomposing action, prepares tbe way for other agencies. When the infiltrating waters contain traces of carbonic acid, the feldspar acted on first loses its lime, if a lime feldspar, by a combination of the lime with this acid ; next, its alkalies are carried off as carbonates, if the supply of carbonic acid continues, or otherwise as silicates in solution. The change thus going on, ends in forming Kaolin or some other hydrous silicate. The carbonate of soda or potash, or the silicate of these bases, set free, may go to the formation of other minerals \u2014 the production of pseudomorphic or metamorphic changes \u2014 and the supplying fresh and marine waters with their saline ingredients. Kaolin is generally a simple hydrous silicate of alumina, expressed by the formula Si Si-t-2fl=Silica 40*0, alumina 44*5, water 15*5 ; occasionally it corresponds to SlSi-j-(-2fl. Orthoclase in changing to the former loses lK-J-3\u00a7i ; or to the latter, 1K+ g-Si. Part of the silica set free may go off with more or less of the potash, or may form opal, quartz, siliceous sinter. The alumina also is often in part removed. The same explanation is readily applied to the change in albite or other feldspars. When the change is not carried on to the exclusion of the protoxyd bases, certain zeolites may result, especially as Bischof states, when labradorite is the feldspar undergoing alteration, which species he describes as giving origin to the species mesolite. Massive nepheline or el\u00e6olite is a still more common source of zeolites. When the waters contain traces of a magnesian salt \u2014 a bicarbonate or silicate \u2014 the magnesia may replace the lime or soda, and so lead to a steatitic change, or to a talc when the alumina is excluded ; and when augite or hornblende is present, it may give origin to chlorite. The action of sulphurous acid from volcanic fumaroles produces often a complete destruction of the feldspar and other minerals present, giving rise to deposits or in crustations of silica, in some of its various forms, and also Halloysite, etc. Steatite, Talc, Chlorite, Kaolin, Lithomarge, occur as pseudomorphs after ortho clase or albite ; and Tin ore and Calcite also replace these feldspars by some process of solution and substitution. Labradorite more rarely forms kaolin. Orthoclase is also described as occurring altered to Albite. This has been men tioned as an example of paramorphism, the two Bpecies being dimorphous. But as these feldspars occur together in the same rock, and must have been formed under very similar circumstances, we can hardly suppose that either is liable to a change like that of a dimorphous compound to the form of the other. The following are analyses of Kaolin. No. 1 to 28 are by Brongniart and Mala guti, who carefully separated the free silica and undecomposed feldspar. Their results are here reduced to 44*5 as constant for the alumina, this being the amount in the Kaolin of the formula, Si Si+2 H. G.=2-21\u2014 2*26.

The first two analyses give the formula H3Si3+9fl, and 7 to 10 nearly SlSi'+6fl. The Unionville mineral occurs with euphyllite; H.=2*25; G.=2*2; yellowish white ; brittle ; crumbles to pieces in water. The Thiviers mineral which Salvetat calls Halloysite, has a rose-red color and is unctuous to the feel. No. 7 is similar. He writes for the formula of these SSi3+7fl Clays are mostly derived from the decomposition of feldspathic rocks. Common clay consists ordinarily of about 1 part of alumina to 2 of silica, besides water; and often there are other ingredients present, as carbonate of lime, oxyd of iron, and some magnesian compounds; and when iron is present it burns red. Acids attack the clay but slightly, showing that the water present is not to any great amount in chemical combination forming hydrous silicates of alumina ; and thus they differ from the Halloysites and related compounds. Catlinite of Jackson, (Am. J. Sci. xxxv, 388), is a variety of reddish clay stone, from the Coteau de Prairies, west of the Mississippi ; and Pipestone, (pfeifenstein) is also a variety of clay slate or argillite. A variety from Northern Oregon, of a grayish color, has been analyzed by Thomson, (Min. i, 287). Such clays or clay-slates have often been altered through infiltrating waters and heat. Of this nature are Agalmatolite, Dysyntribite of Shepard, and Parophite of Hunt. The alteration they have undergone has been dependent not properly upon a kaolinising process, but on the action and addition of alkalies, through the in filtration of solutions containing alkaline silicates or carbonates, which ingredients the decomposition of feldspar produces on a large scale. Agalmatolite i (Figure stone, Bildstein, Pagodite, Lardite, Fun Shih or Powder stone of the Chinese) occurs massive, with a greasy feel and is rather soft. H.=2\u2014 3. G.=2*8 \u2014 2*9.

The composition varies widely, as Smith and Brush have shown. It is from Diana and other places in St. Lawrence Co., Northern New York. B.B. fuses in thin fragments. Parophite of Hunt, (Logan's Rep. Canada, 1852, 95, Am. J. Sci.

The formula SlSi with one-seventh of the oxygen replaced by fluorine, is proposed by Rammelsberg. Physalite or pyrophysalite of Hisinger is a coarse, nearly opaque variety, found in yellowish- white crystals of considerable dimensions ; it intumesces when heated, and hence its name from ipwaw, to blow. Minute crystals of three or four different kinds, and two or three kinds of fluids have been detected by Sir David Brewster in crystals of topaz. Topaz occurs in gneiss or granite, with tourmaline, mica, and beryl, occasionally with apatite, fluor spar, and tin ; also in taleose rock, as in Brazil, with euclase, <fcc, or in mica slate. With quartz, tourmaline, and lithomarge, it forms the topaz rock of Werner. Specimens of quartz crystal from Brazil, penetrated by topaz, are not uncommon. Fine topazes come from the Urals and Altai mountains, Miask in Siberia, and from Kamschatka, of green and blue colors ; Villa Rica in Brazil of deep yellow color, either in veins or nests in lithomarge, or in loose crystals or pebbles ; sky-blue crystals in Cairngorm, Aberdeenshire ; Jameson mentions one which weighed 19 oz. ; the tin mines of Schlackenwald, Zinnwald, and Ehrenfriedersdorf, smaller crys tals also at Schneckenstein and Altenberg ; the Mourne mountains, small limpid crystals with beryl, albite, and mica, in drusy cavities in granite. Physalite occurs in crystals of great size, at Fossum, Norway ; Finbo, Sweden, in a granite quarry, and at Broddbo in a boulder ; one crystal from this last locality, at Stockholm, weighed eighty pounds. Pycnite is from Altenberg, Schlackenwald, Zinnwald, and Kongsberg. Topaz occurs in the United States at Trumbull, with fluor and diaspore, at Mid dletown, Conn., and Crowder's Mountain, N. C. At Trumbull the crystals are abundant, but are seldom transparent, except those of small size ; these are usually white, or with a tinge of green or yellow. The large coarse crystals are sometimes six or seven inches in diameter. A variety of topaz from Brazil, when heated, assumes a pink or red hue, re sembling the Balas ruby. The finest crystals are brought from Minas Novas in Brazil. From their peculiar limpidity, topaz pebbles are sometimes denominated gouttes a\"eau. The coarse varieties of topaz may be employed as a substitute for emery. The name topaz, is from rojrafioj*, an island in the Red Sea. Altered Forms.\u2014 Topaz is found altered both to Steatite and Kaolin or Litho marge. It is possible that pycnite has lost part of its alumina by a process of change, and hence the excess of silica."], [589, "SILICATES, ANDALUSITE SECTION. 261 STAUROTIDE, Haiiy. Staurolite. Grenatite.

The angles /: F are approximately alike, and if polished prisms ofthe latter mineral could be found, they might prove to be much nearer. The terminal planes observed are so rough that were other points of identity made out, we should not rely upon them as evidence of a real difference. But the two minerals, as G. Rose states, (Kryst. Chem. p. 80), differ strikingly in appearance, and widely in specific gravity; and they have not been found associated together, although both occur in the same class of rocks. We therefore adopt the view of Rose, and make them for the present distinct species. SAPPHIRINE, Stromeyer Trimetric? Shows colors with polarized light, hence not mono metric.

With borax they afford a clear yellowish-green glass. Imperfectly soluble in heated muriatic acid ; and if the solution be concentrated along with tin, it becomes of a fine violet color. This species was formerly divided into titanite and sphene; the former included the brown or black variety, the latter the lighter colored and translucent. Greenovite, from St. Marcel in Piedmont, was shown to be identical in crystalliz ation with sphene by Breithaupt (Pogg. lviii, 257) and Descloizeaux, (Ann. Ch. Phys. [3], xx, 84). Sphene occurs in imbedded crystals, in gneiss, granite, mica slate, and granular limestone ; also in syenite, beds of iron ore, and volcanic rocks. Found with py roxene, in beds of iron ore, at Arendal in Norway; in granite in Greenland; in complicated compound crystals of a pale green color and transparent, at Grau binden in the Grisons, associated with feldspar and chlorite ; in mica slate at St. Gothard; also at Mont Blanc, and elsewhere, in the Alps. Small crystals occur in syenite at Strontian in Argyleshire, and Criffel in Galloway. Occasionally it is found among volcanic rocks, as at Lake Laach, and Andernach on the Rhine. Occurs in Canada at Grenville, Elmsley, Burgess and Grand Calumet Island, in amber-colored crystals ; in the trap of Montreal, Yemaska, Monnoir, and Brome Mts. In Maine in fine crystals at Sanford, also at Thurston. In Massachusetts, good crystals in gneiss, in the east part of Lee ; at Bolton with pyroxene and scapolite in limestone ; at Pelham. In Connecticut, at Trumbull. In New Jersey, at Franklin, of a honey-yellow color.

Red and green, at Chesterfield, Mass., in a granite vein with albite, uranite, and pyrochlore; the crystals small and curved, nearly opaque, and fragile ; green crystals often with distinct prisms of red color inside, especially when in smoky quartz ; blue also at this locality. At Goshen, Mass., similar varieties occur, and the blue is met with in greater perfection. ,At Norwich, New Baintree, and Carlisle, Mass., good black crystals ; also Alstead, Grafton, Sullivan, Acworth, and Saddleback Mt., N.

Perfect dark brown crystals in mica-slate near Lane's Mine, Mon- roe, Conn. ; sometimes two inches in length and breadth. At Haddam, Conn., in- teresting black crystals in mica slate with anthophyllite, also in granite with iolite, and also at the gneiss quarries, on the east side of the river. Near Gouverneur, N. Y., light and dark brown crystals, often highly modified, with apatite and scapolite in granular limestone, (f. 253, 254, p. 174); at Canton; in simple prisms in the same rock near Port Henry, Essex Co. ; at Schroon, with chondrodite and scapo- lite ; fine brown crystals at Crown Point, one mile south of village. Black crystals at the chrysoberyl locality near Saratoga, N. Y. ; also at Alexandria, Jefferson Co. ; at Kingsbridge, N. Y., brown, yellowish or reddish-brown crystals in dolomite; gray or bluish-gray and green in three-sided prisms occur near Edenville ; short black crystals in the same vicinity, and at Rocky Hill, sometimes 5 inches in diam- eter; a mile southwest of Amity, yellow and cinnamon colored crystals with spi- nel in calc spar; also near the same village a clove-brown variety with hornblende and rutile in granular limestone. At Franklin, Hamburgh, and Newton, N. J., black and brown crystals in limestone, with spinel. Good crystals in Pennsylva- nia at Newlin, Chester Co. ; at London Grove and near Unionville, of a light yel- low or brownish yellow, (f. 458), in limestone, and rarely white ; at Parksburg ; As- ton; at Chester, fine black; Lieperville, Delaware Co., black ; Marple, Lancaster Co., of a green color in talc; opposite New Hope, Buck's Co.; in New Garden township, Chester Co., in limestone, light brown to yellow and sometimes trans- parent. Near New Hope on the Delaware, large black crystals, in which the pris matic faces are sometimes almost obsolete. Also in Cheowee valley, South Caroli- na; Habersham Co., Georgia. In Canada, superb greenish-yellow crystals, 1 inch through, in limestone at G. Calumet, Id. ; amber colored at Fitzroy, C. W. ; trans- parent brown (f. 457) at Hunterstown, C.

The mica is lepidolite, a species which is related in composition to some tourmaline and is a frequent associate of the red and green varieties. It appears to take place through the addition of alkalies. Some rubellites and green tourmalines at Ches terfield are hollow, evidently from decomposition and removal of the interior ; and in the cavities are occasionally observed small crystals of yellow uranite, (Tesche macher)."], [603, "HYDROUS SILICATES, TALC SECTION. 275 H Hydrous Silicates.

The Meerschaum of Taberg and Sala, Sweden, is a soft earthy serpentine. The Marmolite, according to Hermann, differs in containing more water as well as in its foliated structure, and gives the formula fig3Sia+2figfi3=Mg6Si,B4. Delesse found for Chrysotile from the Vosges the composition of serpentine, (Ann. d. M. [4], xviii, 309). The pseudomorphs, anal. 32, were from Schwarzenburg, in Saxony. As serpentine is mostly a rock, the analyses must be expected to disagree, and every portion of alumina or water present, cannot in all cases be assumed to be an essential constituent. Serpentine yields water in a matrass. B.B. on charcoal, fuses on the edges with difficulty. Dissolves readily in borax ; with effervescence in salt of phosphorus. Gives usually an iron reaction. Soluble in muriatic and sulphuric acids. Serpentine often constitutes mountain masses. Mixed with carbonate of lime, it forms verd antique marble, which occurs often in extensive beds. Chromic iron is often disseminated through it, giving it a mottled appearance, somewhat similar to the skin of a snake, whence the name serpentine or ophite. It is very commonly a result of pseudomorphic (or metamorphic) changes. Hornblende, augite, chryso lite, garnet, spinel, mica, and many other minerals, have thus been altered. De lesse says, that the Serpentine of Odern sometimes so graduates into feldspar as to appear to have been formed at the expense of that mineral. Rose has found that some of the supposed crystals of serpentine are actually part chrysolite, the change not having been complete. Crystals of serpentine occur in the Fassa valley, Tyrol ; near Miask at Lake Ausehkal, Barsovka, Katharinenberg, and elsewhere ; in Norway at Snarum, (crys tals). Fine precious serpentines come from Fahlun and Gulsjo in Sweden, the Isle of Man, the neighborhood of Portsoy in Aberdeenshire, Corsica, Siberia, and Sax ony ; in crystals at Lake Auschkal, in Miask, Borsovka, etc. Common serpen tine occurs at Lizard's Point in Cornwall, and many other places. In the United States, precious serpentine of a light-green color occurs at Phillips town, in the Highlands, N. Y. ; also at Port Henry, Essex Co. ; at Antwerp, Jeffer son Co., in crystals; at Syracuse, eaBt of Major Burnet's, interesting varieties; in Gouverneur, St. Lawrence Co., in crystals, and also in Rossie, two miles north of Somerville ; at Johnsburg in Warren Co. ; Davenport's Neck, Westehester Co., af fording fine cabinet specimens ; in Cornwall, Monroe, and Warwick, Orange Co., sometimes in large crystals at Warwick ; and from Richmond to New Brighton, Richmond County. In Massachusetts, fine at Newburyport ; at Blanford with Schiller spar, and the marmolite variety; also at Westfield, Middlefield, Lynnfield, Newburyport, and elsewhere. In Maine, at Deer Isle. In Vermont, at New Fane, &c. In Rhode Island, at Newport. In Connecticut, near New Haven, at the verd antique quarries. In New Jersey, at Hoboken, with brucite, magnesite, <fcc, and the marmolite variety ; also at Frankfort and Bryan; at Montville, Morris Co., silky fibrous, (chrysotile), and similar at New Haven, Ct. In Maryland, at Coop town, Harford Co., with diallage; also in the north part of Cecil Co.

Bowenite is from Smithfield, Rhode Island. Serpentine also occurs in Canada, (see for analysis by T. S. Hunt, Am. J. Sci. [2], xv, 436, from Logan's Geol. Report, 1851, 1852); a green ish-white subtranslucent variety, is the gangue of chromic iron at Ham \u2022 it afford ed T S. Hunt, Si 43*4, fig 40*0, Si and Fe 3*6, B 13*0. Serpentine admits of a high polish, and may be turned in a lathe, and is some times employed as a material for ornaments, vases, boxes, <fec. At Zoblitz in Sax ony, Bayreuth, and in Franconia, several hundred persons are employed in this manufacture. Verd antique marble is clouded with green of various shades, and is a beautiful material for table and ornamental in-door work. Exposed to the weath er it wears uneven, owing to its unequal hardness, and soon loses its polished sur face. Serpentine may be used for the manufacture of epsom salt. A \"picrolite\" from Silesia afforded Dr. List (Ann. d. Ch. u. Pharm., lxiv, 20) Si 44*606, Mg 39*748, Fe 2*631, B 2*576=99*561. It is remarkable for the small per centage of water. A so-called Baltimorite, from Baltimore, analyzed by von Hauer, (Jahrb. Geol. Eeichs. 1853), is a different mineral from that of Thomson, and probably a mixture. He obtained Si 27*15, Si 18*54, Ca 15*08, fig 26*00, B 13*23=100. See further, p. 293. Retinalite of Thomson is shown by Hunt to be nothing but serpentine, his speci mens having been authentic.

The varieties severally in a matrass yield water ; and B.B. fuse with difficulty to a grayish glass ; with borax form a chrome-green pearl. Wholly decomposed by concentrated sulphuric acid. The oxyd of chromium varies in amount with the color, the paler varieties con taining but little. Smith and Brush attribute the nickel to mixed sulphuret of nickel. The Aker mineral (anal. 2) resembles serpentine in appearance. Chonikrite occurs massive, of a white color, glistening lustre and weak translu cence ; found with pyrosclerite, at Elba. B.B. fuses with intumescence to a grayish glass ; soluble in muriatic acid, without gelatinizing. Vermiculite has a granular scaly structure and greasy feel, and looks like 6teatite. The scales when heated (to 500\u00b0 or 600\u00b0 F) open out into worm-like threads made up of separated lamin\u00e6 of cleavage ; and sometimes, as Dr. C. T. Jackson states, swelling to nearly a hundred times the original length ; and if confined in a glass tube this expansion is so powerful as to break it with an explosion, and scatter the glass to a distance.

Crossley's analy sis was made on the scales carefully separated from the mealy magnesian base with which it is associated. His formula is that of pyrosclerite. Tabergite, called by Werner blue talc of Taberg in Wermland, is considered a distinct species by G. Rose, as it has but little resemblance to pyrosclerite.

Thin leaves are soluble in concentrated sulphuric acid. Chlorite forms extensive beds in Plutonic regions, and is the characterizing in gredient of chlorite slate. Often occurs in quartz crystals, in vermiform crystal lizations, and f. 467 is an enlarged view of a part of a specimen from New Hamp shire, described by Professor Hubbard. Octahedral crystals of magnetic iron, and hornblende, are the most common minerals in chlorite and chlorite slate. Chlorite occurs at the above-mentioned localities and in various parts of the Eastern United States. The name is from x*uP\u00b0f> green. Kokscharov, in a paper on the crystallization of chlorite, mentions numerous planes, and their angles. But the micaceous minerals vary so much by distortion that the angles are seldom trust worthy. (Verh. Min. Ges. St. Petersb., 1850-51, and Am. J. Sci., [2], xv, 437). Fig. 465 is from Kokscharov's paper. Leuchtenbergite is from near Slatoust, in the Ural. Breithaupt considers it an al tered chlorite : Komonen found but 8*62 per cent, of water. Kengott regards it as a distinct species. The Pihlite of Sefstrom from Fahlun, is a doubtful species between talc and mica. The Talc Zographique of Haiiy is & green earth. A Chlorite-like mineral from Pressburg, Hungary, analyzed by von Hauer and de scribed by Kengott, (Sitzb. xi, 609, 1853), is a hydrous biotite, affording the oxv\u00a3en ratio for the protoxyds, peroxyds, silica and water, 1:1:2:1 and formula R3 Si + fiSi+3a or (|R3-r*a}fi)Si+HB.

[Among the Non-magnesian Hydrous Silicates, a large group \u2014 the Zeolite Section \u2014 corresponds with the Feldspar Section of Anhydrous Silicates, in having the oxygen of the protoxyds and peroxyds as 1 : 3 ; and to some ex tent there are analogies in crystallization as well as formula. Thus Analcime is related to Leucite, and Ittnerite to Sodalite, both in form and formula ; while Heulandite and Orthoclase are each monoclinic, with a like oxygen ratio, 1 : 3 : 12. Still these analogies are not to be too closely pressed. Gismondine is regarded as more nearly related to the Scapolite Group ; and Chabazite, excluding the water, has the oxygen ratio of Beryl, and Eudialyte, as well as of Pyrosmalite and Dioptase, besides being related in angles. Another section, including Datholite, corresponds with the Andalusite Section of Anhydrous Silicates, the oxygen of the silica being less than that of the bases ; another section (II) has the augite ratio ; another (III) the gar net ratio. In view of these and other considerations, the above prominent sub divisions are adopted. The ratios on which the divisions are based, are, as with the magnesian species, for the most part independent of the water present in the compound. Thus in the Pectolite Section, excluding the water, Pectolite has an augite ratio (Frankenheim) as well as augite form. The same is true of Laumontite. So also Dioptase and Pyrosmalite have the form and ratio of the Beryl Group. Again, in the Calamine Section, Calamine and Prehnite are hom\u0153o morphous with one another, besides being each pyro-electric : and as written above, they have analogous formulas, (ratio 1 : 1), if the water of Calamine is excluded and that of Prehnite is basic. On the other hand, if part of the water in Apophyllite be regarded as acting as a protoxyd base, the formula may be R3Si2+2B The ratio of in gredients afforded by the analyses is lo'Si, 8Ca, IK, 16B; and if 6fi out ofthe"], [631, "HYDROUS SILICATES, PYROPHYLLITE SECTION. 303 16B be added to the bases, we have I5fi+ 10Si+loB=5R3Si2+lofl=R3Si2-|-2H, which last is probably the true formula of the species, and seems to require that Apophyllite should be arranged in the Pectolite Section, where we place it provisionally. In Okenite the ratio of the oxygen of the bases and silica is 1 : 4, a ratio un known in the Anhydrous Silicates, except in Petalite. The prismatic angle 122\u00b0 19' is so near that of Hornblende that we ra&j suspect an approximation in form under the Monoclinic System. If 3B be considered as acting as a base, the formula is then of the Augite type, (ratio 1:2); and on this ground the species is placed near Pectolite. Rose recognizes the ratio 1 : 2 for the silicate of lime in his formula of Okenite, Ca3Si2+2fi3Si. Pyrophyllite has the ratio and probably the form of Talc, although dif ferent in containing no protoxyds ; it pertains to a section parallel with that of Talc in the Magnesian Series. A considerable group of so-called species, related to Kaolin or Halloysite, might be here added. They are the direct result of the decomposition or alteration of other species, and have already been mentioned under the spe cies from which they are derived. They are as follows: Under Pyroxene, Cimolite, (p. 165), Palagonite, (p. 166). Under Feldspar, Kaolin, (p. 249), Tuesite, Smelite, Lithomarge, Myelin, Melopsite, (p. 250), Pholerite, Halloysite, Smectite, Lenzinite, Samoite, (p. 251), Bole, Ochran, Collyrite, Pipestone, Agalmatolite, (p. 252).] I.

In some crystals the color is arranged in a tesselated manner, the angles being nearly colorless. Haydenite is a yellowish chabazite from Jones's Falls, Maryland. Levy made the form an oblique rhombic prism with 1 : 1=98\u00b0 22', O : 7=96\u00b0 5'. The form is ac tually a scalenohedron (f. 475) differing but slightly from the rhombohedron ; it is apparently the same scalenohedron that occurs in the Nova Scotia chabazite ; angle of edge -Z=97-98\u00b0, of edge Y, about 176\u00b0. The crystals are often in twins paral lel to R, and they are incrusted with chlorite, and sometimes consist of this min eral, unlike the accompanying heulandite, (beaumontite).

Waltershausen found a trace of phosphoric acid and supposed it combined with the Pe. Occurs in amyg daloidal rocks at Monteechio Maggiore, and at Castel in the Vicentine, at Glenarm, and the Island Magee. Gmelinite is usually considered rhombohedral, and the crystals as twins, secon dary to a rhombohedron of 86\u00b0 18'. Tamnau makes R : R as in chabasite, and the pyramidal faces the form f2. The hexagonal cleavage observed by Rose separates it widely from chabasite. It was named after Prof. C. Gmelin, of Tubingen. Herschelite is from Aci Castello, Etna, Sicily, along with Phillipsite. The crys tals are colorless hexagonal prisms and tables, and are generally aggregated like those of Prehnite ; bases convex with traces of a flat rhombohedron. Damour's analyses give (Ba, K)3 Si2-|-3Sl Si3-(-15B, making it a distinct compound from the above.

The faces of the crystals never have the stri\u00e6 of those of Phillipsite, and the mam millated specimens are not columnar within ; moreover Phillipsite does not lose any of its water below 100\u00b0. Kobell analyzed the mineral called Gismondine or zeago nite, with a different result, (J. f. pr. <!hem. xviii, 105). (See below.) Brooke considers them cruciform twins of Phillipsite.

Long slender prismatic crystallizations of a grayish white color are obtained at Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, where it is associated with apophyllite, mesotype, lau montite, and other trap minerals. Ozarkite, as Smith and Brush show, is an amorphous or fibrous radiated Thom sonite.

B.B. natrolite becomes opaque and is often phosphorescent; it fuses quietly to a glassy globule. Gelatinizes readily with acids, even after ignition. This species occurs in cavities in amygdaloidal trap, basalt, and other allied rocks ; and sometimes in seams in granite or gneiss. It is found in the graustein of Aussig in Bohemia; in Auvergne; the trap rocks of Kilmalcolm in Renfrewshire, and Glenarm in the county of Antrim and elsewhere. The Radiolite is from Brevig. Bergmannite is a red or white natrolite, from Zircon syenite near Brevig. Lehuntite is from Glenarm, and if Thomson's analysis is correct it contains 3B like the scole cites, although a soda-mesotype. Kengott finds the angle i\": 7=91\u00b0.

The species here included, may perhaps be arranged in some of the groups of silicates, when their composition is better understood. In sphene, a sili cate of the same kind, we have pointed out a close relation to the ordinary silicates, the titanic acid acting as a base. The same appears to be true in Keilhauite, which may prove, as we show, to be related to sphene. The other species may have similar relations to some of the anhydrous silicates. The following are suggested as probably the general formulas under which the species fall. 1. Keilhauite, (R3, K)Si* (like sphene). 2. TsCHEFFKINITE, (R3, R) Si* 3. Schorlomite, (R3, KlSiT. 4.

The oxygen ratio between the bases and silica (reckoning Ti with the former, as in sphene) is very closely 3 : 2, the sphene ratio ; and the formula may consequently be HSii* or (R3,R/Si\u00a3* The lime (Ca) united with the Ti is equivalent to a peroxyd (that is Ti02+Ca0=R203=R).

Small splinters blacken and color the flame deep yellow. Pulverized, it dissolves easily in borax or salt of phosphorus ; adding largely of the fluxes, it forms a clear glass, which, with still more of the flux, becomes yellowish-green; with less, the glass remains colorless. Pyrrhite was found by von Perofski of St. Petersburg, at Alabaschka, near Mur sinsk, where it occurs in drusy feldspar cavities, containing also tables of lithia mica, crystals of albite, and white topaz. The largest crystal was but three hnes long. The name is from irvppos, yellow. With this species J. E. Teschemacher identifies small orange-yellow octahedrons found with albite at the Azores. The crystals are a half to two lines long, and those of minute size are transparent. According to chemical and blowpipe trials by A. A. Hayes, on specimens furnish ed him by Mr. Teschemacher, these crystals consist of columbate of zirconia, colored apparently by oxyds of iron, uranium, and manganese. B.B. in the forceps, on the first impulse of the heat, becomes darker, and the fine orange color returns on cooling, even if the heat has been high; at the melting point of cast iron, in the reduction flame, the flame becomes permanently darker and brown.

With a little more of assay, the glass remains clear. With soda (12 'parts to 1 of assay) dissolves; some clear portions are seen in the globule while hot, but on cooling, opacity precedes the crystallization of the globule ; finally a gray-brown slag remains, which cooled from the outer flame, has a green color indicating oxyd of manganese. Decomposed by much soda, and the resulting mass heated with nitric acid, gives a heavy white insoluble powder, which with boiling water takes a white flocculent form ; the powder exhibited all the characters of columbic (niobic) acid. The acid solution, when mixed with carbon ate of ammonia, remains clear ; heated, some oxyd of iron falls, and the fluid is light yellow ; with oxalic acid, a white earth separates, which, heated with sul phuric acid to destroy the oxalic acid, dissolves, and the fluid forms with potash be fore complete neutralization, a white double salt, which has the characters of that from zirconia, but may also contain oxyd of cerium. The oxalate when first formed did not afford when heated the cinnamon-brown color characteristic of deutoxyd of cerium. The extremely small amount of the mineral under examination forbids the expression of certainty respecting the base. Although inclining to the opinion of the existence of cerium in the mineral, from the red color of the crystals, Mr. Hayes observes that he obtained no positive proof on this point. SCHEELITE, Leonh.

A red variety contains a trace of chromic acid. B.B. decrepitates briskly and becomes darker, and afterwards on cooling, the color disappears. On charcoal it fuses and is absorbed, leaving behind globules of metallic lead. With borax in the exterior flame, it fuses readily to a slightly color ed glass ; in the interior flame, the glass is transparent, but on cooling becomes all at once dark and opaque. Melts readily with salt of phosphorus, producing a green glass, when the proportion ofthe mineral is small, but black and opaque, if large. This species occurs in veins in limestone with other ores of lead, at Swarzenbach, Bleiberg, and Windisch-Kappel in Carinthia. It is also met with at Retzbanya in Hungary, and at Moldawa in the Bannat, where its crystals are red and have considerable resemblance to chromate of lead. 2 9 i 3 1 ji 2 Z2 it \u00a5 \u00a5_ li iS ii"], [678, "350 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY.

Damour finds in a Limoges variety 78*74 columbic acid, Fe 14*50, fin 7*17=100*41 (Ann. des M. [4], xiv, 423). The yttria and uranium of the Ilmen columbite, Her mann attributes to a mixture witli Samarskite. Specimens of the highest specific gravity at Bodenmais, give a black powder, and others of less gravity a dark reddish brown. The Limoges specimens (analysis 11, 12) resemble those of Bavaria, in streak ; and Damour has proposed for this variety the name Baierine ; but Rose has shown that the metal pelopium, supposed to dis tinguish the variety, is identical with Columbium, (Rose's niobium). Wollaston's analysis was made on four grains of the original specimen in the British Museum, sent out from Connecticut by Governor Winthrop to Sir Hans Sloan e. B.B. alone, on charcoal, infusible. With borax, in powder, fusion takes place slowly but perfectly, forming a blackish-green glass. Columbite of Bodfenmais, in Bavaria, on the Rabenstein, near Zwiesel, occurs in granite. In the United States it occurs both in feldspathic and alhitic granite. The occurrence of columbite in America was first made known by Mr. Hatchett's examination of a specimen, sent by Governor Winthrop to aSir Hans Sloane, then President of the Royal Society, which was labeled as found at Neatneague.

Repos. vol. viii) that it was taken from a spring at New London, Conn. No locality has 6ince been detected at that place. But the redis covery of it at Haddam, first published by Dr. Torrey, (Amer. J. Sci. iv, 52), has led to the belief that the latter was its original locality. It has since been discover ed more abundantly near Middletown. At Haddam it occurs in a granite vein, with chrysoberyl, beryl, and automolite : also two miles from the chrysoberyl locality, (anal. 14) ; also at the iolite locality! Finer crystals come from a feldspar quarry near Middletown, along with albite ; figure 503, represents one with brilliant faces three quarters of an inch long ; another described by Professor Johnston, (Amer.

Hermann's name yttroilmenite alludes to the supposed new metal ilmenium, alledged to exist in this species ; in his recent analysis he makes the acid columbic with a little ilmenic acid. Heated slightly in a glass tube, it decrepitates, disengages sometimes a little moisture, and glows like gadolinite, becoming of a brownish-black color. In the platinum forceps it melts on the edges to a black glass. On platinum wire with borax the pulverized mineral fuses easily, and forms in the inner flame a yellowish glass, and in the outer a yellowish-green glass ; with muriatic acid forms with difficulty a green solution. Uranotantalite occurs in reddish-brown feldspar, with crystallized \u00e6schynite, in the Ilmen mountains, near Miask in the Ural. The largest pieces met with were of the size of hazel-nuts.

At Freiberg in Saxony, a variety occurs composed of indistinct prismatic crystals, and having a pearly lustre ; this is the Stangenspath of Werner. Rounded masses, composed of diverging columnar particles, occur at Mount Paterno, near Bologna, which have hence been called the Bolognese stojie. At Staffordshire and Derbyshire is found an opaque massive variety, of an earthy ap pearance and dirty- white color ; this variety has been called cawk.

Anhydrite has been variously denominated muriacite, anhydrite, tripe stone, (gfkriisstein), according to its structure ; the first, when crystallized in broad lam ellae ; the second when granular ; and the third when composed of contorted plates. Vulpinite is a siliceous variety, containing 8 per cent, of silex, and having the hardness 3*5. Pseudomorphs in cubes, imitative of rock salt, have been de scribed by Haidinger. Crystallized anhydrite occurs at the salt mines of Bex in Switzerland, and at Salzburg near Hall in the Tyrol. At Aussee, both crystallized and massive, the latter brick-red. Also at Sulz on the Neckar, in Wurtemberg ; at Bleiberg in Ca rinthia ; at Liineberg, Hanover ; at Lauterberg in the Hartz ; at Kapnik in Hun gary; at Isehl in Upper Austria ; and at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria.

This ore has been found principally at Leadhills, associated with other ores of lead ; Grenada is also stated to be a locality of it, and the island of Serpho, Gre cian Archipelago. The crystals Beldom exceed an inch in length, and are common ly smaller. Reported by C. U. Shepard, (Am. J. Sci. [2], xv, 446), from Newberg District, South Carolina, but there is some doubt as to the locality. Brooke and Miller, who show that the form of Leadhillite is trimetric, make the prism il (of 120\u00b0 20'), the fundamental vertical prism, and appear to regard the species as related to Aragonite. The fact that the twins are not formed parallel to the faces of this prism, (as they should be if the prism Ji were homologous with the Aragonite prism), and the close approximation in angle to Anglesite, shown above, besides other reasons, have led the author to adopt the position of the crystals here given, which exhibits the Anglesite relation. Susannite (rhombohedral) and Leadhillite (trimetric) are mutually dimorphs, and so also are Dreelite and Angle site. Now Susannite and Dreelite are nearly identical in angle ; and therefore Leadhillite and Anglesite must be equally related. Since in Susannite the sulphu ric acid dominates over the carbonic acid and impresses on the lead salt its charac ter, (or the form of the sulphate), the same should be the case with its correlate Leadhillite \u2014 this species being the very same chemical compound. (See on this subject, Am. J. Sci. [2], vol. xviii). The hemihedrism of the species gives origin to the peculiar rhombohedral aspect of the twins. The angles of these twins are near those of Susannite. CALEDONITE, Beud Cupreous Sulphato-Carbonate of Lead, Brooke, Ed. Phil. Jour, iii, 117. Halbazurblei, Ramm.

It is also produced by the decomposition of pyrites when lime is present; and often about sulphur springs where sulphuretted hydrogen is emitted, this gas changing through reac tion with vegetable matter into sulphuric acid. Gypsum is also deposited on the evaporation of sea-water and brines. Fine specimens are found in the salt mines of Bex in Switzerland ; at Hall in the Tyrol ; in the sulphur mines of Sicily ; in the gypsum formation, near O^ana, in Spain ; in the clay of Shotover Hill, near Oxford ; and large lenticular crystals have been met with at Montmartre, near Paris. Derbyshire affords the fibrous varieties. alabaster occurs at Castelino, 35 miles from Leghorn, whence it is taken to Florence for the manufacture of vases, figures, &c. Gypsum also occurs in acicular crystals in most volcanic regions. This species occurs in extensive beds in several of the United States ; and more particularly New York, Ohio, Illinois, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas, and is usually associated with salt springs. Also in Nova Scotia, Peru, &c. Handsome selenite and snowy gypsum occur in New York, near Lockport, (occa sionally f. 532), in limestone along with pearl spar and anhydrite ; also near Camillus, Onondaga County, occasionally crystals are met with in the vicinity of Manlius In Ohio, large transparent crystals, have been found at Poland and Canfield, Trumbull County ; in Maryland, large grouped crystals on the St. Mary's in clay; also near the mouth ofthe Patuxent; in Iowa, in perfect crystals in the shales of the coal measures on Cedar river, a branch of the Des Moines, and elsewhere on the latter river. Selenite and Alabaster occur in Davidson County, Tennessee, and large beds of gypsum with rock salt in Washington County, Virginia, eighteen miles from Abingdon. In the Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, it presents singular imita tions of vines, flowers, and shrubbery. Plaster of Paris, or gypsum which has been heated and ground up, is used for making moulds, taking casts of statues, medals, &e., for producing a hard finish on walls ; also in the manufacture of artificial marble, as the scagliola tables of Leg horn, and in the glazing of porcelain. The fibrous variety when cut en cabochon, and polished, resembles cat's eye. Gypsum is related in form to heulandite, a fact brought out in the view above taken of the crystallization, (Am. J. Sci.

A polish ed plate of iron introduced into the solution causes the copper to be deposited upon it. Blue vitrol is found in waters issuing from mines, and in connection with rocks containing copper pyrites, by the decomposition of which it is formed. Its foreign localities are the Rammelsberg mine near Goslar in the Hartz, Fahlun in Sweden, also Anglesea, and Wieklow; also Rio Tinto mine, Spain. The waters of the Rio Tinto mine have yielded annually 1800 cwt. of copper, consuming 2400 cwt. of iron. At Wieklow about 500 tons of iron were laid in the pits at one time, and in about twelve months the bars were dissolved, and every ton of iron yielded a ton and a half to two tons of a reddish mud, which was oxyd of copper, each ton af fording 16 cwt. of pure copper. Found at the Hiwassee copper mine in Polk Co., Tennessee, 30 miles from Cleveland. When purified, it is employed in dyeing operations, and in the printing of cotton and linen, and for various other purposes in the arts.

The roof of the grotto is a quartzose conglomerate, containing manganese and pyrites. The floors of the limestone caves of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana, are in many instances covered with Epsomite, in minute crystals, mingled with the earth. In the Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, it adheres to the roof in loose masses like snow balls. It effloresces from the calcareous sandstone, ten miles from Coeymans, on the east face of the Helderberg, N. Y.

Boracic acid occurs in but few minerals ; viz. Datholite, Danburite, Axi nite, Tourmaline and Warwickite, with the following. It is a remarkable fact that in all of them, as far as known, the crystallization is either hemi hedral or oblique. Boracite and Rhodizite are hemihedral monometric; Danburite, hemihedral trimetric ; Tourmaline, hemihedral rhombohedral ; while Danburite and Axinite are triclinic. In Tourmaline and Axinite, boracic acid acts the part of a base ; and if the same may be admitted to be the case in Boracite, it is in composition as well as form, related to the protoxyds and magnetite."], [721, "393 BORATES.

It is sometimes met with in serpentine, and occasionally, as in Spain, in ancient volcanic rocks. Among its localities are Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony, Schwarzenstein and Pfitsch in the Tyrol; Amberg in Bavaria ; Zinnwald and Schlackenwald in Bohemia ; Caldbeck Fell in Cumberland, Devonshire ; St. Gothard in Switzerland. The green ish-blue variety, called moroxite, occurs at Arendal in Norway, and Pargas, Finland. The asparagus stone or spargelstein variety, which is obtained at Zillerthal in the Tyrol, and Villa Rica, Spain, is translucent, and has a wine yellow-color; it is im bedded in talc. The phosphorite or massive radiated varieties are mostly obtained from Estremadura in Spam, aud Schlackenwald in Bohemia. Large crystals of apatite are found in St. Lawrence County, New York, in white limestone, along with scapolite, sphene, &e. One crystal from Robinson's farm, in Hammond, was nearly a foot in length, and weighed eighteen pounds. The prisms are frequently well terminated.

In New Hampshire, crystals, often large, are abundant, four miles south of the north village meeting-house Westmoreland, in a vein of feldspar and quartz, in mica slate, along with mo lybdenite ; some fine crystals at Piermont, N. H., in white limestone on the land of Mr. Thomas Cross. In Maine, on Long Island, Blue-hill Bay, in veins ten inches wide, intersecting granite. In Massachusetts, crystals occasionally six inches long, are obtained at Norwich, (northeast part), in gray quartz ; at Bolton abundant, the forms seldom interesting ; also sparingly at Chesterfield, Chester, Sturbridge, Hinsdale, and Williamsburgh. In Pennsylvania, at Leiperville, Delaware Co., in Bucks Co., three miles west of Attleboro. Apatite has also been found near Balti more, Maryland ; at Dixon's quarry, Wilmington, Delaware, of a rich blue color ; on the Morris Canal, near Suckasuny, N. J., of a brown color, in massive magnetic pyrites ; Phosphate of lime in nodules occurs in Silurian rocks in Canada and elsewhere, which are supposed to be coprolites ; at Burgess, C. W., in large green crystals ; at Grand Calumet in calcite, in delicate blue crystals ; in trap of St. Norbert, C. E., in transparent amethyst, rose, or colorless crystals, some one inch long, and one-sixth in diameter. Apatite was named by Werner from airaraa, to deceive, in allusion to the mistake ofthe older mineralogists with regard to the nature of its many varieties. The Pseudoapatite is an impure apatite; analysis by Rammelsberg, J. pr. Chem. Iv, 486. The talc-apatite of Hermann, (J. f. pr. Ch. xxxi, 101), is from chlorite slate in the Schischimskian mountains near Slatoust. It contains Lime 37*50. magnesia 7*74, phosphoric acid 39*02, sulphuric acid 2*10, chlorine 0*91, fluorine and loss 2*23, oxyd of iron 1*00, insoluble 9*50=100, whence the formula 3 Ca3 \u00a3+]VIg3 \u00a3. But from the variety of its constituents and the large per-centage of insoluble ingredi ents, Berzelius suggests that the magnesia may possibly come from the gangue. G.= 2*70 \u2014 2*75.

According to Watts and Chapman, (loc. cit. p. 154), the form is probably dimetric ; yet as the crystals of both this species and the cryptolite are microscopic, the two, as observed by Chapman may yet be brought together. They occur as a grayish yellow powder along with the cobalt ore of Tunaberg, and are associated with dark purple crystals of anothor kind and dodecahedral form, (Fe3S4), which are strongly magnetic. The crystalline forms most common in the powder are an octahedron and a square or rectangular prism terminating in a four-sided pyramid parallel with the lateral planes, resem bling fig. 382, under zircon.

A less pure variety is found in Silesia, and Oelsnitz in Saxony. It receives a good polish, and when finely colored, is highly esteemed as a gem. The Persian king is said to retain for his own use all the larger aud finely tinted specimens. The occidental or bone turquois is said to be fossil bones or teeth color ed with oxyd of copper.

Greg, Jr. ; it has the appearance of^ being altered. Named from rpts, three, and ipv\\ri, family, in allusion to its con taining three phosphates. Telraphyline, (or Perowskine), a similar compound, is from Keiti, in Finland. In the analysis below, the excess is supposed to be due to an incorrect determination of the lithia. It differs in physical characters from the preceding, in presenting a yellow color on its surface of fresh fracture, which by degrees becomes black. It afforded Berzelius and Nordenskiold, (Jahresb. xv, 211), P 42*6, Fe 38*6, Mn 12*1, Li 8*2, Slg 1*7=103*2.

B.B. decrepitates, loses color, and becomes opaque ; if pulverized, it fuses to a dark brown or black scoria, which affects the magnetic needle. Heated in a glass tube, it yields pure water. Dissolves in dilute nitric and sulphuric acids. It occurs associated with magnetic and common iron pyrites in copper and tin veins ; also in narrow veins with gold, traversing gray-wacke ; occasional ly, it is met with in trap rocks. The friable and crystallized varieties occur in clay, and are sometimes associated with bog iron ore. At St. Agnes in Cornwall, transparent indigo crystals have been found, 1 in. in diameter and 2 long, on magnetic pyrites ; at Bodenmais, and the gold mines of Vo rospatak in Transylvania, in crystals ; on the promontory of Kertsch in the Black Sea, in large indistinct crstals in the interior of shells.

J., it occurs in considerable abundance, both crystallized in nodules and earthy, imbedded in bog iron ore, and associated with clays; also atMullica Hill, Gloucester Co., N. J., (the mullicite of Thomson), in cylindrical masses consisting of divergent fibres or acicular crystals. At Frank lin, N. J., this species is occasionally found. It often fills the interior of belemnites and other fossils, in the ferruginous sand formation ; also (see analysis 7 above) 4 miles west of Cantwell's Bridge, in the green sand of Delaware, in fine large crys tals which are colorless when first obtained, evidently as Fisher observed, contain ingonly protoxyd of iron. At Harlem, N.Y., vivianite in crystals accompanies stilbite and feldspar in the fissures of gneiss. It occurs in the north part of Somerset and Worcester Cos., Maryland; with bog ore in Stafford Co., Virginia, and eight or ten miles from Falmouth, with gold and galena; also near Cape Henlopen, Sussex Co., Delaware; with limonite at Vandreuil, Canada East, abundant.

The fibrous is the wood-arsenate, (Holzkupfererz), a variety from Cornwall, pre senting a soft velvet-like surface, and a siskin or greenish-gray color. B.B. in the forceps affords a brown crystalline bead ; on charcoal fuses with a kind of deflagration, and yields arsenical fumes and a white brittle metallic globule, which, as it cools, becomes covered with a red scoria. Dissolves in nitric acid, and also in ammonia. The crystallized varieties occur disposed on, or coating, cavities of quartz, at the Cornwall mines ; also in inferior specimens at Alston Moor, in Cumberland.

This mineral usually occurs in the cavities of calamine, calc spar, or quartz, accompanied by other ores of copper, appearing in small aggregated and diverging fibrous groups of a pale-green color, and possessing a delicate silky lustre. It has been observed in the Bannat ; at Posing and Libethen in Hungary ; Nertschinsk in Siberia ; Falkenstein and Schwatz in the Tyrol ; Saalfeld in Thuringia ; Riechels dorf in Hessia ; Schneeberg in the Erzgebirge. Rammelsberg suggests that this species may be related to Aurichaleite ; the lat ter has a yellowish-green color and may thus be distinguished. DELVAUXENE, Dumont. Delvauxit.

Gibbs found in a specimen from the Calamine mines of Altenberg, 4*074 oxyd of zinc, with 0*849 magnesia, 0-512 protoxyd of iron. A variety called plwnbocalcite from Leadhills, contains, according to Delesse, 97-61 carbonate of lime, and 2*34 carbonate of lead, with 0*05 of water. Johnston found in the same from Wanlockhead, Scotland, 7*8 per cent, of carbonate of lead. Natrocalcite includes pseudomorphs after Gay- lussite from Sangerhausen, in which Marchand found (J. f. pr.

Iodine has been found in certain fossiliferous limestones, as at Gouzon, by Lembert, (J. de Pharm., [3], xix, 240). B.B. infusible ; loses, however, carbonic acid, gives an intense light, and ulti- mately is reduced to pure lime, or quicklime. Effervesces with borax, and pro- duces with a larger quantity a clear glass, which becomes somewhat angular on cooling. With cobalt solution affords a black or grayish-black unmelted mass. Many granular limestones phosphoresce with a yellow light when pulverized and thrown on a heated shovel. Acids produce a brisk effervescence. Calcite appears under a very great variety of forms and aspects, and, conse- quently, was distributed by the earlier mineralogists into several distinct species. These now constitute varieties. Iceland spar includes transparent calc spar ; the best specimens come from Ice- land. Satin spar is a fibrous variety, having a satin lustre. Oolite consists of minute spherical grains resembling the roe of a fish ; it is so called from uov, an egg. The Peastone, or Pisolite, differs from oolite in the larger size of its particles ; these particles are composed of concentric lamin\u00e6. Chalk is a massive opaque earthy variety, usually white, soft, and without lustre ; Agaric Mineral, or Rock Milk, is * From Rossie Crystals, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. f Fig. 674B, Bergen Hill, N. J."], [767, "439 ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. a loose friable variety, deposited from waters containing carbonate of lime in solu tion; it is found about lakes whose waters are impregnated with lime; also in fissures in limestone and in limestone caverns ; it is called calcareous tufa, if so hard as not to be friable. Prunnerite is grayish violet, from Faroe. Marble includes all the imperfectly crystalline and earthy varieties which admit of a high polish. The Stinkstone, Swinestone, or Anthraconite, which is found columnar, granular, and compact, of various shades, emits a fetid odor when struck with a hammer. Sta lactites are pendant masses of limestone, formed in limestone caverns by the perco lation of water, holding lime in solution, through their rocky roofs ; the water which drops to the floor from the roof also evaporates, and forms a layer of limestone over the floor, which is called Stalagmite; and both stalactites and sta lagmites when polished are often called Alabaster in France. Argentine possesses a silvery- white lustre, a slaty structure, and contains a little silica. Slate spar and aphrite are similar varieties. Marl is a mixture of clay and carbonate of lime. The Fontainbleau Limestone is an aggregate of secondary rhombohedrons, contain ing, mechanically mingled, a large proportion of sand. A similar variety is found on the African coast between Sandanha Bay and Ichaboe Island, in great quan tities in the sand ; they contain fifteen to twenty per cent, of sand. Strontianocalcite of Genth., (Proc. Ac. Phil, vi, 114), is opaque, white, and crys tallizes like calcite; form uneven, globular, the globules terminating in acute rhombohedrons, (4R, 65\u00b0 50'), H.=3*5. A crimson flame before the blowpipe and affords some strontia. Granular limestone includes common statuary and architectural marble, having a texture something like loaf sugar. Compact limestone has a compact texture, usually an even surface of fracture, and dull shades of color. Hydraulic limestone is an impure limestone. The French varieties contain two or three per cent, of magnesia, and ten to twenty of silica and alumina, (or clay). The varieties in the United States contain twenty to forty per cent, of magnesia, and twelve to thirty per cent, of silica and alumina. A variety worked extensively at Rondout, N. Y., afforded Professor Beck (Min. N. Y., p. 78) Carbonic acid 34*20, lime 25*50, magnesia 12*35, silica 15*37, alumina 9*13, peroxyd of iron 2*25. Oxyd of iron is rather prejudicial to it than otherwise. The Cipolin marbles of Italy are white with shadings or zones of green talc. The Bardiglio is a gray marble having a whitish basis with crowded dark cloudings ; from Corsica. The Sienna is yellow with cloudings, and Brocatello di Sienna has clouds of bluish red or purplish shades. Portor is a Genoese marble of deep black color with veinings of yellow; the best is from Porto- Venese. Bird's-eye marble is a compact limestone with crystalline points disseminated through it. Ruin marble is yellowish with brown shadings or lines representing castles, towers, and cities in ruins ; the markings are due to infiltrated oxyd of iron or manganese. Shell marble contains scattered fossil shells; crinoidal or encrinital includes joints of en erinites of a disk-shape ; madreporic marble is made up of fossil corals, and has a stellate surface when polished. Fire marble or lumachelle is a dark brown shell marble, having brilliant fire or chatoyant reflections from within. Languedoc marble is of a light red color, with lighter spots due to corals. The marble of Sarancolin in the Pyrenees is deep red mixed with gray and yellow, and some transparent spots. Alabaster has been brought largely from Chili and Algiers. Marl contains often forty to fifty per cent, of lime. This species, in some form, is very generally diffused. England and France con tain extensive strata of chalk. Italy, from her Carrara beds, and Greece, from the Pentelican quarries, have provided the world with statuary marble. The greater part of the middle and western sections of the United States are underlaid with strata of limestone, and white or granular limestone occurs in various portions of the Eastern States. Andreasberg in the Hartz is one of the best European localities of crystallized calcite; there are other localities in the Tyrol, Styria, Carinthia, Hungary, Saxony, Hesse Darmstadt (at Auerbach), Hesse Cassel, Norway, France, and in England in Derbyshire, Cumberland, Cornwall, Scotland; in_ Iceland. In Iceland a single rhombohedron (R) over six yards long and three high has been observed. The most interesting localities of calcite in the United States, both as regards size of crystals and form, exist in St. Lawrence and Jefferson Counties, N. Y., espe cially at the Rossie lead mine; the crystals are highly modified, (f.575, \\\\ (o'), i (a), y (\u201e\"), || (0\")( l' (e), and are often transparent even when large ; one gigantic"], [768, "440 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. crystal, nearly transparent, in the cabinet of Yale College, weighs 165 pounds; they are often covered in part by crystals of galena. At the natural dam two miles from Gouverneur, in the same vicinity, good crystals are obtained ; also at the Wilson vein in Gouverneur, and the Jepson vein in Rossie. At the Paris ore bed in Gouverneur fine geodes occur in specular iron. In Jefferson County, near Oxbow, on the land of Mr. Benton, large crystals sometimes as clear within as Iceland spar, have been obtained from a decomposing limestone. The rose and purple varieties are very beautiful. Some large crystals weigh a hundred pounds and upwards. Four miles south of Oxbow, in Antwerp, there is a vein of calc spar and lead, which affords beautiful cleavage masses of white, purple, and brownish shades. Interesting crystals are also procured here. In Essex Co., N. Y., town of Moriah, on Mill Brook, near Port Henry, crystals of calc spar occur in white limestone. Dog tooth spar (f. 574A, I3 and also I3. -2) occurs in Niagara County, near Lockport, with pearl spar, celestine, selenite, and anhydrite ; also in Onondaga County, near Camillus, along the railroad. Good crystals are found in Herkimer County, a mile south of Little Falls, in the bed of a small stream ; in Lewis County, at Leyden and Lowville, and at the Martinsburg lead mine ; and on the western bank of Dry Sugar River, near Boon ville, Oneida County, (f. 574C.) In Maine, at Thomaston, lenticular and prismatic crystals are common. In crystals (\u00bb2. \u2014 }. /, short or long, and I3. R) at Middletown, Ct. Lead Mine. In New Jerssy, at Bergen, fine crystallizations of yellow calc spar occur with datholite, <fee., in trap, (f. 574B). At Franklin, a pink variety is met with, and good cleavage specimens may be obtained. In Nova Scotia, Partridge island affords a wine-colored calc spar, and other interesting varieties. In Pennsylvania, Iceland Spar in York County. In splendid crystals at Lake Superior Copper Mines, especially the Minnesota, the crystals often containing scales of native copper. Argentine occurs near Williamsburg and Southampton, Mass., and at the iron mines of Franconia, N. H. Agaric mineral covers the sides of a cave at Watertown, N. Y.- Stalactites of great beauty occur in the celebrated Wier's cave, Virginia, and the large caves of Kentucky. Fine specimens are also found in the many caverns of Scoharie, N. Y., of which Ball's cave is the most famous. Fibrous carbonate of lime occurs in New York in consid erable abundance at Camillus and Scoharie, (near the barytes locality), and of a fine satin lustre near De Long's Mill, St. Lawrence County. Corals of which large reefs are formed in tropical regions, consist mainly of car bonate of lime. B. Silliman, Jr., obtained for a recent species of Madrepora, (Dana's Report on Zoophytes, and also Amer. Jour. Sci. [2], i, 189), Carbonate of Lime 94*807, phosphates and fluorids, &c, 0*745, organic matter 4*448. And_the deposit of phosphates and. fluorids afforded the per-centage \u2014 Si 12*5, Ca 7*5,Mg4*2, MgF 26*62, CaF 26*34, Mg,P 8*00, 3:1 aud Fe 14*84. Other analyses gave similar results. The material of the common marbles is either granular or compact limestone. These rocks when burnt form quicklime. A fine compact limestone is employed in lithography, and that from Solenhofen in Bavaria, is most noted. Calc spar is also used as a flux for smelting ores.* Hydraulic limestone appears to owe its peculiar qualities to the clay present, which is very uniformly and intimately mingled, and is therefore in the best con dition to combine with the lime in the formation of a cement. Altered Forms. \u2014 Calcite occurs altered to Dolomite, Calamine, Spathic Iron, Malachite, Gypsum, Smithsonite, Heavy Spar, Fluor, Limonite, Gothite, Red Iron Ore, Minium, Meerschaum, Chlorite, Quartz, Chalcedony, Garnet, Feldspar, Pyro lusite, Hausmannite, Manganite, Marcasite, Galena, Blende. The change to Dolo mite, as Bisehof explains, may take place through bicarbonate of magnesia in solu tion ; to Spathic Iron (FeC) through sulphate of iron in solution, forming sulphate of lime and carbonate of iron ; or by carbonated waters containing bicarbonate of iron, which slowly dissolve Calcite, while the carbonate of iron takes its place, forming a pseudomorph by substitution ; to Smithsonite (ZnC) through sulphate of zinc in solution, and also by the substitution process just mentioned ; to Calamine(Zn' Si\u2014 (-1 *H) probably by a change first to 2n0 and then to the silicate, through alkaline silicates in solution, or by a process of substitution, the CaC being dissolved away * For various analyses of limestones, see Rammelsberg's Handw. der Min. and Supplements, Kengott's Min.

G.=2*921. Soluble in the acids, but more slowly than calcite. B.B. acts like calcite ; some varieties darken and increase in hardness. The name Dolomite is applied to white crystals, and to the granular varieties. Pearl spar includes rhombohedral crystallizations with curved faces and a pearly lustre. When the crystals are not curved, and have a brown or reddish-brown color, they are called Brown spar : this variety contains 5 to 10 per cent, of oxyd of iron or oxyd of manganese. Ankerite contains still more iron ; R : iJ=106\u00b0 12'. Gur hofian is a compact snow-white subtranslucent variety, so named from a locality of it at Gurhof, in Lower Austria. The Traversella dolomite (anal. 28) has been called Brossite : 72=106\u00b0 20'. Granular dolomite constitutes extensive beds in various regions. Crystalline and compact varieties are often associated with serpentine and other magnesian rocks. Pearl spar occurs in geodes in compact limestones and other stratified rocks. Rhomb spar is found in Salzburg, the T3T0I, and at Miemo in Tuscany, whence the name Miemite was derived. Brown spar and Pearl spar are obtained at Sehemnitz in Hungary, Kapnik in Transylvania, at Freiberg in Saxony, in the lead mines at Alston in Derbyshire, and at other places in Devonshire. The Ankerite is from Styria and elsewhere. Roxbury, Vt., affords large yellow transparent crystals of the rhomb spar variety imbedded in talc. A coarse cleavable variety occasionally presenting perfect crystals is associated with white talc in calc spar, at Smithfield, R. I. White hexagonal crys- tals (f. 584) occur at Hoboken, N. J. The pearl spar variety is abundant in geodes at Lockport, Niagara Falls, and Rochester, N. Y., accompanying calc spar, celestine, and gypsum ; also at Glen's Falls. Massive dolomite forms extensive beds in Litch- field Co., Conn., in the southwestern towns of Massachusetts, in Vermont, in various parts of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, &c. Crystallized dolomite occurs in rhombohedrons at the quarantine, Richmond Co., N. Y., and at Hoboken, N. J. Brown spar occurs at Warwick, N. Y. and at the Parish ore bed, St. Law rence County, N. Y. A variety resembling Gurhofite is found on Hustis's farm, Phillipstown, N. Y. It has a semi-opaline appearance, and a fracture nearly like porcelain. . Dolomite is generally supposed to be injurious as a manure for soils, on account of its magnesia ; but this is not so, unless used after calcination, before it is fully air slaked. The lime it affords when burnt, makes a more durable cement than common limestone. The rock is generally less firm or more friable than pure granular lime stone, and therefore not as good for building stone. This species was named in honor of Dolomieu.

It is often associated with metallic ores. At Freiberg it occurs in silver mines. At Cornwall it accompanies tin. It is also found accompanying copper and iron pyrites, galena, vitreous copper, <fec. In New York according to Beck, it is almost always associated with specular iron. Oc casionally it is to be met with in trap rocks as spherosiderite."], [774, "446 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. In the region in and about Styria and Carinthia, this ore forms extensive tracts in gneiss, which extend along the chaiu of the Alps on one side into Austria, and on the other into Saltzburg. At Harzgerode in the Hartz, it occurs in fine crystals in gray-wacke ; also in Cornwall, Alston Moor, and Devonshire. - The Spherosiderite occurs in greenstone at Hanau, Steinheim and Dransberg, and many other places. Clay iron stone, which is a siliceous or argillaceous carbonate of iron, occurs in coal beds near Glasgow; also at Mouillar, Magescote, &c, in France, etc. At Roxbury, Conn., an extensive vein occurs in quartz, traversing gneiss ; also at Plymouth, Vt, and at Sterling, Mass. In small quantities it occurs at Monroe, Conn., at Lane's mine ; also in rhombohedral crystals in New York, at the Sterling ore bed in Antwerp, Jefferson Co., and at the Rossie iron mines, St. Lawrence Co. ; at Fentress and Harlem mines, North Carolina. The argillaceous carbonate in nodules and beds is abundant in the coal regions of Pennsylvania, and many parts of the west. This ore is employed very extensively for the manufacture of iron and steel The Junkerite of Dufrenoy is shown by Breithaupt (Pogg. lviii, 278, 1843) to be common spathic iron. Altered Forms. \u2014 Spathic iron becomes brown or brownish-black on exposure, owing to a peroxydation of the iron and its passing to Limonite, (Feafl3); and by a subsequent loss of water, it may pass to Red Iron ore or Specular Iron, (Fe), or to magnetite, (Fe Fe), the last at times a result of deoxydation of Fe by organic sub stances. It also changes by substitution or through the action of alkaline silicates, to quartz. DIALLOGITE, Beud Carbonate of Manganese. Brown Spar, in part Red Manganese. Manganspath, Werner. Rhodochrosite.

B.B. loses transparency, but doeB not melt ; carbonic acid is driven off, and oxyd of zinc is obtained or passes off in white flakes. Dissolves with effervescence in nitric acid. . . Smithsonite is found both in veins and beds, especially in company with galena and blende ; also with copper and iron. It usually occurs in calcareous rocks, and is generally associated with Calamine."], [776, "448 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Fine specimens of Smithsonite are obtained at Nertschinsk in Siberia ; one variety has a dark brown color, and contains cadmium ; another is of a beautiful bright green. Other localities are Dognatzka iu the Bannat of Temeswar in Hungary ; Bleiberg and Raibel in Carinthia; Altenberg, near Aix la Chapelle. Concentric botryoidal groups are met with in the Mendip hills and at Wanlockhead, in Dum freisshire. _ In the United States, Smithsonite is found occasionally at the lead mines of Missou ri, and Wisconsin, though the ore is mostly silicate of zinc. Mine Hill, near the Franklin furnace, New Jersey, the Perkiomen lead mine, Pennsylvania, and the lead mine at Brookfield, Conn., afford it in small quantities. At Franklin it occurs only in a pulverulent form, and results from the decomposition of red zinc ore. Altered Forms.\u2014 Smithsonite changes though the action of alkaline silicates, to Calamine (2n3 Si-(-^fl) ; or becomes incrusted with silica and forms quartz pseudo morphs. It is also sometimes replaced by Limonite or Gothite. ARAGONITE. Eisenbluth, W. Igloite. Flos ferri. Needle Spar. Tarnowitzit Aragonspath. Trimetric.

A Thurnberg variety afforded E. Riegel, (Jahrb. pr. Pharm. xxiii, 348), 2*2 per cent, of carbonate of strontian. A fibrous variety from Dufton in Cumberland, afforded 4-25 per cent, of fin C. When aragonite is heated, it falls to powder. It is phosphorescent on red hot iron, and soluble with effervescence in nitric and muriatic acid. The most common repositories of aragonite are beds of gypsum, beds of iron ore, (where it occurs in coralloidal forms, and is denominated/os-/m*\u00ab, ' flower of iron') , basalt, and trap rock ; occasionally it occurs in lavas. It is often associated with copper and iron pyrites, galena, and malachite. It is forming at an old mine in Monte Vasa, Italy, at a temperature below the boiling point of water. This mineral was first discovered in Aragon, Spain, (whence its name), at Molina and Valencia, near Migranilla, in six-sided prisms, with gypsum, imbedded in a ferruginous clay. It has since been obtained in compound hexagonal prisms at Bilin, in Bohemia, in a vein traversing basalt ; at Breisgau in Baden ; at Baumgar ten and Tarnowitz in Silesia ; at Leogang in Salzburg, Austria ; in Waltsch, Bohemia, and many other places. The flos-ferri variety is found in great perfection in the Sty rian mines, coating cavities and even caves of considerable extent, and associated with spathic At Dufton, a silky, fibrous variety, called satin spar,, occurs traversing shale in thin veins, generally associated with pyrites. In Buckingham shire, Devonshire, ifcc, it occurs in stalactitic forms in caverns, and of snowy white ness at Leadhills in Lanarkshire. The variety tarnowitzite (analysis 7 above) cor responds to plumbocalcite, under calcite. Kersten found in another specimen 2*19 of carbonate of lead. An aragonite deposited in stalactites, etc., at the Carlsbad Springs, called Sprudelstein, contains 0*69 per cent, of fluorid of calcium and a trace of arsenic. Aragonite in fibrous and other forms occurs in Serpentine at Hoboken, (it has been called magnesite). Flos-ferri occurs sparingly at Lockport, N. Y., coating gypsum in geodes; at Edenville, N. Y., lining cavities of mispickel and cube ore; at the Parish ore bed, Rossie, N. Y. ; and at Haddam, Conn., in thin seams between layers of gneiss. A coralloidal aragonite occurs at New Garden, in Chester Co., Pennsylvania. Altered Forms. \u2014 Aragonite may undergo similar changes with calcite. It also passes to calcite, through paramorphism. Pseudomorphs of copper after aragonite are reported from Bolivia. WITHERITE, Werner. Withering, Phil. Trans. 1784, p. 293. Carbonate of Bary- tes. Barolite.

The Sulphato-carbonate of baryta of Thomson, (Min. i, 106), from Bromley Hill, Cumberland, is only a mixture. Witherite occurs at Alston Moor in Cumberland, associated with galena, in veins traversing the coal formation ; in splendid crystals sometimes transparent, and oc casionally six inches long, at Fallowfield in Northumberland. The fibrous translu cent variety occurs at Anglesark, in Lancashire. Tarnowitz in Silesia ; Szlana, Hungary ; Leogang in Saltzburg ; Peggau in Styria ; Barnaoul, Russia, in the Altai ; some places in Sicily ; and the mine of Arqueros, near Coquimbo, Chili, are other localities. For several of the above figures the author is indebted to R. P. Greg, Jr., who observes that all the supposed simple crystals are compound. Altered Forms. \u2014 Witherite is altered to Heavy Spar (BaS) through the action of sulphate of lime iu solution at the ordinary temperature, or by the action of other sulphates in solution, or of water containing sulphuric acid.

Thomson found the two varieties from Strontian to contain 6 to 8*64 per cent, of CaC ; and another from the United States, named by him Emmonite, in honor of Prof. Emmons, affords 12*5 per cent, of CaC. Similar specimens come from Clausthal, and from Hamm in Westphalia. Schnabel found in the latter 7 *89 per cent, equiva lent to 1 CaC to 8 SrC. (Ramm. 4th Suppl, 215; also 5th Suppl., 231). The former contains five to eight per cent, of CaC. B.B. melts on the edges and then swells out, emitting a brilliant light, and in the reducing flame strongly heated gives the flame a reddish tinge : assay gives an al kaline reaction. Effervesces with nitric and muriatic acids. Paper wet with the solution in these acids and dried, burns with a red flame. Strontianite occurs at Strontian in Argyleshire, in veins traversing gneiss, along with galena and heavy spar, in stellated and fibrous groups, rarely in perfect crys tals. Yorkshire, England; Giant's Causeway, Ireland; Clausthal, in the Hartz; Braunsdorf, Saxony ; Leogang in Saltzburg, Austria, are other localities. In the United States it occurs at Scoharie in granular and columnar masses, and also in crystals, forming nests or geodes often large in the hydraulic limestone, as sociated with heavy spar, iron pyrites, and calc spar. At Muscalonge Lake a mas sive and fibrous variety of a white or greenish-white color, is sometimes the matrix of fluor spar. Chaumont Bay and Theresa, in Jefferson Co., N. Y., are other local ities. Massive strontianite has been found by Mr. James Heron, at Warwick, N. Y. Barystrontianite from Stromness, in Orkney, consists of SrC 62*6, Ba'S 27*5, CaC 2*6, and oxyd of iron 0*1.

Amber occurs abundantly on the Prussian coast of the Baltic ; occurring from Dantzig to Memel, especially between Pillau and Dorse Gross-Hubnicken. It oc curs also on the coast of Denmark and Sweden; in Gallicia, near Lemberg, and at Miszau; in Poland; in Moravia, at Boskowitz, etc.; in the Urals, Russia; near Christiania, Norway ; in Switzerland, near Bale ; in France, near Paris in clay, in the department of the Lower Alps, with bituminous coal, also in the department of 1' Aisne, de la Loire, du Gard, du Bas Rhin. In England, near London, and on the coast of Norfolk, Essex, and Suffolk. It also occurs in various parts of Asia. Also near Catania, on the Sicilian coast, sometimes of a peculiar blue tinge. At Hasen Island in Greenland, it also occurs in brown coal. It has been found in various parts of the Green sand formation of the United States, either loosely imbedded in the soil, or engaged in marl or lignite, as at Gay Head or Martha's Vineyard, near Trenton and also at Camden in New Jersey, and at Cape Sable, near Magothy river in Maryland. The vegetable origin of amber is now fully ascertained. This is inferred both from its native situation with coal, or fossil wood, and from the occurrence of in sects encased in it. Of these insects, some appear evidently to have struggled after being entangled in the then viscous fluid, and occasionally a leg or wing is found some distance from the body, which had been detached in the effort to escape. Gbppert has named the tree yielding it Pinites succinnifer. Amber was early known to the ancients, and called riXturpov, electrum, whence, on account of its electrical susceptibilities, we have derived the word electricity. It was called by some Lyncurium, though this name was applied, as is supposed, also to Tourmaline, another mineral of remarkable electrical properties ; also succinum, because of its supposed vegetable origin, as stated by Pliny, \"quod arboris succum, prisci nostri credidere.\" Amber is extensively employed for ornamental purposes, though not of high val ue. In the royal museum at Berlin, there is a mass weighing fourteen pounds. Another in the kingdom of Ava, India, is nearly as large as a child's head; it is intersected by veins of carbonate of lime, from the thickness of paper to one twen tieth of an .inch."], [795, "RESINS, ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. 467 It is used in the manufacture of a varnish, and for obtaining succinic acid and oil of amber, which it affords at a low temperature.

Petro leum is a dark Colored fluid variety, containing much naphtha. Maltha or Mineral tar is a more viscid variety. Asphaltum is abundant on the shores of the Dead Sea. It occurs also in reni form stalactitic masses at Matlock in Derbyshire ; in granite, with quartz and fluor, at Poldice, in Cornwall; in cavities of chalcedony aud calc spar, in Russia, and other places. Naphtha issues from the earth in large quantities in Persia and the Birman empire; at Rangoon there are upwards of five hundred naphtha wells, which afford annually 412,000 hhds. A remarkable lake of bitumen occurs on Trinidad, which is one and a half miles in circumference. The bitumen is solid and cold near the shores, but gradually increases in temperature and softness towards the centre, where it is boiling. The solidified bitumen appears as if it had cooled as the surface boiled in large bubbles. The ascent to the lake from the sea, a dis tance of three quarters of a mile, is covered with a hardened pitch, on which trees and vegetables flourish, and about Point La Braye the masses of pitch look like black rocks among the foliage. The lake is underlaid by a bed of mineral coal, (Manross)."], [798, "470 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. In the peninsula of Apcheron, on the western shore of the Caspian, naphtha rises in vapor through a marly soil, and is collected by sinking pits several yards in depth, into which the naphtha flows. Near Amians in the state of Parma, is an abundant spring. Near Alfreton, England, naphtha has been discovered. Petroleum is met with at Kenhawa in Virginia, Scotsville, Ky., Oil Creek in Venango Co., Penn., Duck Creek, in Monroe Co., Ohio, and Liverpool, Ohio. It was formerly collected and sold by the Seneca and other Indians, and is hence called Seneca or Genesee oil. Also at Inniskillan, Canada West, the inspissated petroleum in some places is two feet deep. (Logan's Geol. Rep. 1852, 90.) Naphtha affords both fuel and lights to the inhabitants of Badku, on the Caspian. It is also employed in Persia and the Burman empire as a lotion in cutaneous eruptions, and as an embrocation in bruises and rheumatic affections. It is* em ployed for various purposes in the arts, particularly in the manufacture of varnish, and as a substitute for oil in the formation of oil paint, it being preferred on account of its rapid evaporation and drying. Bitumen, in all its varieties, was well known to the ancients. It is reported to have been employed in the construction of the walls of Babylon, and at Agrigen tum it was burnt in lamps, and called Sicilian oil. The Egyptians also made use of it in enbalming. Two ship loads of the Trinidad pitch were sent to England by Admiral Cochrane, but it was found that the oil required to render it fit for use, exceeded in expense the cost of pitch in England, and the project of employing it was therefore abandoned. Asphaltum is a constituent of the kind of varnish called Japan ; it is also made into a cement for lining cisterns, and with ground stone into a material for pave ments. Naphthadil. A substance derived from naphtha. It is black ; weak, greasy lustre ; copper-brown in fracture. Does not change in the light.

Fluid. Colorless. Transparent. Expands one-fourth its size by an increment of 30\u00b0 F., or is nearly 32 times more expansible than water, by an increment of 30\u00b0 of heat at the temperature of 50\u00b0. r Occurs in minute cavities in crystals of topaz, chrysoberyl, quartz crystals from Quebec, and amethyst from Siberia, where it was detected by Sir DavM Brewster. We have thought proper to recognize this fluid among minerals and name it, al though yet imperfectly described. The fluid expands with the heat of the hand. Its refractive power is less than that of water. It was sometimes indurated in the cavity like a resin. On exposure, the fluid undergoes quick motions and changes, and finally leaves a residue of minute particles, which from the moisture of the hand alone, suddenly became fluid again, and extended and contracted as before. This was indefinitely repeated. The residue is volatilized by heat, and dis solves in the acids without effervescence. Crtptoline. \u2014 A second fluid was also distinguished in the same crystals that con tained the preceding, and often in the same cavities ; yet they were not miscible, and remained distinct. On exposure it hardens speedily into a yellowish transpar ent resin-like substance, not volatitizable by \"heat, nor soluble in water or alcohol, but rapidly dissolving with effervescence in sulphuric acids. Nitric and muriatic acids also dissolve it. Refraction index nearly that of water. [See further Edin burgh Royal Trans. vol. x; also Am. J. Sci. xii, 214, 1827]. ELATERITE, Hausmann.

Note. \u2014 The rock of the Mississippi valley containing the remarkable deposits of galena, (sometimes regarded as the equivalent of the \" Cliff \" or \" Upper Mag nesian\" Limestone), is considered by James Hall as between the Hudson River and Trenton Groups of New York in age, and as having no representative in the eastern part of the United States. The sandstones and conglomerates of the Lake Superior copper region in Michigan are referred by Foster and Whitney, Hall, Owen, and Logan to the age of the Potsdam sandstone, or the lowest Silurian ; while the copper bearing red sandstone of Connecticut and New Jersey, is shown by Rogers, Red field and Hall, to be as recent as the Liassic Period. The metamorphic limestone of northern New York, (St. Lawrence Co., etc.), and north near the bay of Qumte, in Canada, abounding in apatite, scapolite, etc., is referred by T. S. Hunt to the Azoic System ; the beds of western Vermont, west ern Massachusetts, and south eastern New York and New Jersey, (containing in the latter regions especially, chondrodite, spinel, etc.), to the lower Silurian, as pre viously shown by H. D. Rogers and W. W. Mather ; those of middle New England, occurring near Milford and New Haven, Ct., and north near Lake Memphremagog, and on the Chaudiere in Canada, to the upper Silurian. Still a fourth range of the Devonian Period is supposed to occur in eastern Massachusetts, and to include the quarries of Bolton, Chelmsford, etc. The intervening micaceous, gneissic and other rocks are of intermediate age; while those of northern New York, the most remote from the carboniferous deposits of Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, are the most ancient."], [827, "APPENDIX.

Hom\u0153omorphism. \u2014 In a paper on the relations between Chemical Compo sition and Crystalline Form, (Paris, 1852), by M. Ladrey, from whom it has been just now received, the author reviews many different classes of compounds, princi pally minerals, and shows that all or nearly all of the forms may be obtained from fundamental forms, near 90\u00b0 in angle, by assuming as tbe fundamental form where necessary, one having some simple relation to that usually so adopted. Relations to the monometric system are thus brought out, and also hom\u0153omorphisms inde pendent of composition. In deducing the relations, cleavage, twin composition, and all other points bearing on the actual or potential dimensions of a species, are disregarded ; points which are dwelt upon in the chapter on hom\u0153omorphism, and which have led the author to a similar general conclusion by a different, and, as we believe, by a more consistent method.

[3], xxxvi, 131, 1850).\u2014 Monometric In minute cubes; planes 0, 1, I, i2. H.=2*5. Color sky-blue ; streak similar. Composition.\u2014 Contains, according to Percy, (loc. cit.), lead, chlorine, and copper, and probably oxygen ; the quantity under analysis was too small for complete re sults The examination gave, besides some water, chlorine 0*84, lead 2*66, copper 0*77 corresponding to equal atomic equivalents of these, ingredients. Mr. Percy supposes that an equivalent of oxygen should be added and writes the formula (PbCl+PbU)+(CuCl-l-CuO)+Aq. B.B. by slight heat the blue color changes to emerald-green and reappears on cooling ; in the outer flame, the flame is green within and blue at the edges; fuses very easily and in a tube fumes were given off, but no odors were perceived. On charcoal in the inner flame metallic globules are obtained, which dissolve without residue in dilute nitric acid With borax in the outer flame, a transparent bluish-green bead is obtained, which in the inner flame becomes turbid and brownish-red. . Accompanies gold. in a matrix of quartz, and red oxyd of iron, and is said to have come from La Sonora, in Mexico.

Occurs at the tin mines of Altenberg, in crystals which are |,mostly altered to Kaolin. Scheerer points out a relation in some angles to Ba rytes ; but the form is in fact very much like that of Datholite, as shown in the angles and in the annexed figure, altered in position from that given by Scheerer; iss : i2f=77\u00b0 to 78\u00b0, (76\u00b0 44, in Datholite) ; 0 : 2i=135\u00b0, (same in D.); 2 ; 2=132\u00b0, (131\u00b0 52' in D.) ; 21 : 27 itop)=116i\u00b0, (115\u00b0 26' in D.) ; 2^: 2r=119\u00b0, (118\u00b0 9'inD.) Is it possible that the fluorine has been introduced through the process of alteration, and that the mineral is when unal tered, nothing but Datholite ? The name is from irpo<rajrt-ioi/, a mask, and alludes to its deceptive or masked condition. RIOLITE, Frbbel. \u2014 A selenid of silver, consisting according to Del Rio, of Silver 57*66, selenium 42*34=Ag Se2. Occurs in small hexagonal tables of a lead gray color and malleable, at Tasco in Mexico. Requires further examination. The com position and form would place the species in the Covelline Group, p. 54.

Meteoric Minerals. \u2014 Several substances occurring in meteorites have been named by C. U. Shepard as minerals, which are imperfectly described and little known. See Am. J. Sci., [2], ii, 377, vi, 402, xv. 363. They are called Apatoid, Sphenomite, (so called from Sphene), Dyslytite, Iodolite, Chladnite, Chantonnite, Schreibersite, (changed by Haidinger to Shepardite), Hyposulphite of Soda, Hyposulphite of Mag nesia, (Am. J. Sci., ii, 377), Olivinoid, (so called because like Olivine), Howardite, (ib. vi, 402), Partschite, (ib. xv, 366). 2. Additional notices of described species. Amber.\u2014 According to Prof. Goeppert, Amber is derived from at least eight spe cies of plants besides the Pinites succinifer. The resin is supposed to have been altered to Amber through fossilization. Prof. Goeppert enumerates 163 species of plants represented by remains in Amber. \u2014 Monatsb.

The right to a name in each of these so-called species is very questionable. Calamine, p. 313. \u2014 Altenberg crystals of Calamine have been measured by H. Dauber, Pogg. xcii, 245, June, 1854. Calcite, p. 435. The Fontainbleau crystals contain, according to Delesse, up wards of fifty per cent, of sand.

Chileite. \u2014 Domeyko's vanadate of lead and copper, p. 363, is named Chileite by Kenngott. This is'the second species so called, the name being a synonyme under Gothite. Chloropal, p. 337. \u2014 Named Unghwarite by Glocker, and regarded as a good spe cies by Kenngott. Occurs amorphous ; H=2*5\u2014 3 ; G=2*10\u2014 2*16 ; greenish-yellow; streak greenish- white ; lustre weak waxy. B.B. infusible, but becomes'' brown to black in a glass tube, and gives off water. Muriatic acid takes up the hydrate of iron. Von Hauer obtained in an analysis, (Kenngott's'Min. Notizen, ix), Si 57*76 Fe 20*86 Ca 1*77 fl 19*78=100*17 This result differs considerably from other analyses. Chrysocolla. \u2014 L. S\u00e6mann communicates to the author that he has specimens of Chrysocolla from Chili, which have in the interior the fibrous structure and composi tion of pure malachite, showing that the whole was once malachite. In an earthy Chrysocolla-incrustation from Chili, Berthier found sulphuric acid, (analysis p. 310); and in another Kittredge (anal. 11, p. 310) obtained neither car bonic nor sulphuric acid. The Chrysocolla analyzed by Scheerer, (anal. 8, p. 310), occurs with feldspar, and is supposed to have resulted from the action of sulphate of copper on the feldspar. Bischof observes (Lehrb. ii, 1885) that silicate of copper may be formed through the action of an alkaline-, lime-, or magnesia-silicate on sulphate or' nitrate of copper in solution. He also shows that this silicate is decomposed by carbonated waters, producing carbonate of copper. The silicate is slightly soluble in pure water, and therefore may act in forming the pseudomorphs after carbonate of lead and libe thenite, which have been described. Its solubility and formation by the methods stated, account for its occurrence in hydrous silicates, as Allophane. The alkaline silicates are furnished by the decomposing granite, and the sulphate of copper by altered pyritous copper. Clay and Clayey Earths, Earthy hydrous aluminous Silicates. \u2014 Various com pounds of this nature are described on pp. 165, 249 to 253, and 337 to 340.

Clintonite, p. 297. \u2014 Two recent analyses of this mineral by G. A. Brush, (com municated to the author, by letter dated Miinchen, Aug. 7, 1854), afforded, Si Sl Fe Zr Ca Mg Na K fl 1. 20*24 39-13 3*27 0*75 13*69 20*84 1*14 0*29 1*04=100*39.

These results of Mr. Brush give for the oxygen ratio of R, R, Si, 12*55 : 19*47 : 10*74 and 12*78 : 19*29 : 10*69. Adding the oxygen of the protoxyds and peroxyds, the ratio for R-ffi, Si becomes 32*02 : 10*74 and 32*73 : 10*69, or very closely 3 : 1, while the ratio for the oxygen of the protoxyds and peroxyds is 2:3; the former of which ratios, however expressed in a formula, appears to be the. characteristic of the species. Kobell's Disterrite afforded the oxygen ratio for R, R, Si, 11*24 : 21*26 : 10*60, and for R+R, Si, 32*50 : 10*60, which gives the same oxygen ratio. 3 : 1 nearly for the bases and silica. Both correspond to (R3, R)Sii-j-Aq, with R3 : R as 2 : 3 in the Clintonite, and 1 : 2 in the Disterrite. The water is nearly wanting in the Clintonite, according to Brush. If we regard one third of the. peroxyds in Brush's analysis as replacing silica, the oxygen ratio for R, R, (Si), becomes 12*78 : 12*86 : 17*12; 'or between the bases and the rest 25*64 : 17-12=3:2, giving the formula ($R3-f$R) (Si, Sl)$> which is the formula deduced on pp. 289, 297. Copper Glance, p. 46. \u2014 A crystal weighing half a pound has been found in the mines near Angina, Tuscany. The Mount Catini Mine affords Copper -Glance, and also Native Copper, Red Copper, and Copper Pyrites. Covelline, p.65. \u2014 The Covelline of Leogang, in Salzburg, occurs mostly massive, but affords minute crystals, according to Kenngott, which present faces of two hexago nal pyramids; the acuter pyramid has for its basal edges the angle 155\u00b0 24'; and the inclination of a face of this pyramid on one of the other is 150\u00b0 24'. Color: indigo-blue, with submetallic somewhat greas}* lustre, a little pearly on the cleavage face; streak black; H.=l*5 \u2014 2. G.=4-636 \u2014 4*590.

An earthy variety from the same place affords Si 49*06, Mg 28*50, H 16*25, Fe 0*69, C 4*76=99*28, affording the oxygen ratio for B, ft, Si, nearly 3:2:6. Eliasite, p. 108. This species differs widely from Pitchblende in its lower specific gravity and the large proportion of water. 64"], [834, "506 APPENDIX, Enargite, p. 87. \u2014 Crystals of Enargite, which are trimetric, have been measured by H.

Feldspar. \u2014 M. Scheerer obtains for an albite from Snarum the oxygen ratio for ft, R, Si, 1 : 3 : 11 ; and as the ratio is intermediate between that of albite and oli goclase, he proposes to call it oligoclase-albite. A feldspar from the zircon-syenite of Norway, analyzed by C. Gmelin, he regards as consisting of 1 of oligoclase, 1 of albite, and 1 of orthoclase ; another from the Syenite of Ballons, as composed of 1 of oligoclase and 2 of orthoclase ; and the same for another from Plombieres, ana lyzed by Delesse.

Kaolin. \u2014 The author is indebted for the mode of presenting the analyses of Kaolin, on p. 249, to M. Louis S\u00e6mann of Paris. M. S\u00e6mann observes that the hy drous silicates of alumina proceeding from the decomposition ofthe feldspars never"], [835, "507 APPENDIX. contain more alumina than silica, and they mostly come under the formula Sl Si+ 2H. The species Collyrite, Allophane, Searbroite, and Miloschine, which contain much less silica, have not proceeded from the decomposition of feldspars, but through sulphates of alumina produced by the alteration of pyrites. The earthy silicates con taining two or more equivalents of silica have probably proceeded from the decom position of aluminous pyroxenes. Lavendulan, p. 417.\u2014 According to trials by J. Lindacker, (Jahrb. k. k. Geol. Reichs., iv, 555), Lavendulan contains oxyd of copper, arsenous acid, and water, with also osyd of cobalt, lime, and sulphuric acid. It is a result of alteration of different ores, and occurs with arsenates of cobalt and nickel, nickel ochre, copper black, and cobalt pyrites.

Geol. de France, [2], x, 342), the hydraulic mortar owes its character to the formation of subsalts of lime, magnesia, alumina, or iron, with car bonic acid aud silica, that is, salts containing an excess of base. Lime may form a subcarbonate (containing two equivalents of lime and one of acid) which is insol uble, and has hydraulic characters. This subcarbonate contains half an equivalent of water ; with the silica a subsilicate forms containing 5 of water ; and he observes also that there is a subaluminate with 7$ equivalents of water. These subsalts are stable only below a temperature of 212\u00b0 F. The virtue therefore of the hydraulic rock depends on the excess of bases or earthy ingredients. M. Delesse has de tected a hydrated subcarbonate of lime in bone caverns of the Jura beds. Magnesite. \u2014 A specimen from Madras afforded Pfeiffer, (Ann. Ch. u.

No. 60 of Silliman), 76\u00b0 10'-76\u00b0 40'. From a review of all the observations and the analyses, as far as they have been made, it appears that there are at least two great groups \u2014 one including the biotites and phlogopites, the other the muscovites and lepidolites. The line between the last two is not at present distinct either in composition or optical characters. Be tween the two former there is a difference of composition, according to the analyses made, and, as far as known, the optical angle of the phlogopites is hardly below 5\u00b0. Judging from the descriptions of the specimens examined by Grailich, there were but few phlogopites among them. The color and general habit of the phlogopites, as well as their occurrence in granular limestone, will usually distinguish them from either the biotites or muscovites. But more analyses are required to clear up the whole subject ofthe micas, and especially to ascertain what importance, if any, attaches to the distinction whether the plane of the optical axes lies in the longer or shorter diagonal. M. Grailich shows that, with slight exceptions, the angle in creases with the specific gravity in the mica of a given locality. Thus seven micas from Pressburg, Hungary, have respectively the following specific gravities and op tical angles : Specific gravity, 2*714 2*735 2-755 2*782 2*790 2*793 2*796. Angles, 69*7 70*0 70*5 71*2 72*3 72*4 72*0. We refer to M. Grailich's paper for his mathematical details. * This must be an error, as we know of no mica in granite at Weathersfield."], [837, "509 APPENDIX.

Boiled in concentrated muriatic acid it is discolored and the silica separates as a powder. Delesse states that in attacking the mineral with acids, the bases which resist the action longest are the alkalies ; the magnesia, oxyds of iron, and alumina yielding first. Bischof observes the same fact with mica slate ; and it explains why minerals containing alkalies are often attacked by acids with difficulty. \u2014 L' Institut, June 14, 1854. Schreibersite, p. a63. \u2014 Dr. J. Lawrence Smith finds that the Schreibersite (Patera) is quite common in meteorites, being often mistaken for magnetic pyrites.

Thorite, p. 312. \u2014 The following method is proposed by S\u00e6mann for distinguishing the species Thorite. The powder is decomposed easily by muriatic acid, especially if heated; after adding some drops of sulphuric acid to the solution, it should be evaporated to dryness ; then turn some cold water on the white residue and it dis solves out the sulphate of thoria \u2014 a Bait which has^the property of forming a pre cipitate in flocks which collect at the bottom of the platinum crucible, and render the liquid gelatinous if the solution is a strong one. \u2014 A pseudomorph of thorite (orangite) after orthoclase is described by H. Dauber, Pogg. xcii, 250, June, 1854. Topaz, p.259. \u2014 According to a recent memoir by H. St. Claire Deville and M. Fouque-, topaz and some other silicates containing fluorine, when highly heated, lose the flu orine as fluorid of silicium. Topaz thus loses 2.3 per cent, of this fiuorid. They arrive at Sl Si4 as the formula of topaz, part of the oxygen of the silica being re placed by fluorine. Compt. Rend, xxxviii, 317."], [841, "513 APPENDIX. It is remarkable that analyses apparently equally trustworthy, recent as well as old, give for Andalusite the two formulas SlSi* and Sl Si* ; for Staurotide the two Sl Si* Sl Si* ; for Sillimanite, Sl Si* and Sl 8i*> and perhaps others ; and now topaz in the present state of chemistry of the species, is divided between Sl gi* and Sl Si** Moreover Sphene, (H) Si* is hom\u0153omorphous with Euclase (S) Si* ; and all the above are pleomorphous with Tourmaline, (R3, R, B) Si*. Kyanite alone appears to give to all recent analysts the same uniform result, Sl Si*; and the uniformity on this species makes it more incredible that the variations in the case of the other species should be all attributable to errors of analysis. Tourmaline, p. 270. \u2014 Kenngott has deduced essentially the same formulas for Tourmaline as that given on page 271, except that he writes B3 O3 for boracic acid, aud regards it as replacing alumina. Min. Notizen, No. ix. Triphyline, p. 406. \u2014 Altered forms of triphyline are mentioned on page 407. L. S\u00e6mann states that Melanchlor (p. 428) is also a result of the alteration of Triphy line, and occurs as an incrustation on unaltered Triphyline ; that Heterosite, Pseudo triplite and the Norwich mineral are the results of a further change ; that Hur eaulite and Alluaudite are connected with Triplite in origin. (Communicated to the Author.) Turquois, p. 405. \u2014 The bone Turquois, or Odontolite, according to L. S\u00e6mann owes its color to a phosphate of iron, as stated by Dufrenoy, (Min. ii, 361). True turquois, when decomposed by muriatic acid giveB a fine blue color with ammonia, which is not the ease with the odontolite. This mineral has a fine turquois blue color, and a very compact but earthy texture. It is formed along with fossil bones or teeth, being like vivianite connected with organic phosphates in its origin.

The proportion of silica, alumina, and alkalies, differs little from the same iu Orthoclase; and is it not that species? Wohlerite, p. 343. \u2014 H. Dauber has figured and described a crystal of Wohlerite, (Pogg. xcii, 242). He gives the crystal the same position as that by the author. Adopting the lettering of f. 494, it contains the planes \u2014 il I ii is ii il ft l2f \u00a7\u00a7 2j Dauber's lettering, a m g k b k d o p i All but two of which planes are in Desloizeaux's figure, from which f. 494 was taken, and one of these two, 3j, is probably the correct symbol for that letteredUt, from Descloizeaux. The angles according to Dauber vary considerably as the faces are not very brilliant ; and in fact he makes the brachydiagonal what Descloizeaux makes the maerodiagonal. The latter gives for Jon the broad face lettered il, 136\u00b0 27', whence I: 1=90\u00b0 54', while Dauber obtained 134\u00b0 51', giving 89\u00b0 42' for the same /: I.

GOLD. \u2014 Native Gold, (p. 7). Distinguished from all minerals it resembles by its flattening under a hammer; its cutting like lead, although considerably harder ; its resisting the action of nitric acid, hot or cold ; its high specific gravity. Gold also occurs in Gold Amalgam, (p. 15), Sylvanite, (p. 64) and Nagyagite, (p. 65). Also sometimes in traces in Pyrites, Galena, Chalcopyrite, Native Tellurium. PLATINUM.\u2014 IRIDIUM.\u2014 PALLADIUM.\u2014 Native Platinum, (p. 12), the source of the platinum of commerce, is distinguished by the same tests as gold ; and it is mainly on account of its malleability that it occurs in flattened grains or scales. Platiniridiun (p. 13) is another ore somewhat harder. Iridosmine (p. 19) resem bles platinum ; but it scratches glass, and gives the reaction of osmium, besides being rather brittle. Native Palladium, (p. 14). SILVER. \u2014 The important Silver minerals are : 1, Native Silver, (p. 16), sectile and malleable like gold, the only one that has a white color ; 2, Silver Glance or Sulphuret of Silver, (p. SI), blackish lead gray, cutting (UDlike the following) nearly like pure lead, cubic in crystallization ; 3, Pyrargyrite and Proustite or Ruby Silver Ore, (pp. 77-78), ruby red to black, always giving a bright red powder; 4, Freisle benite or Gray Silver ore, (p. 79), steel gray, rather brittle and powder steel-gray; 5, Stephanite or Brittle or Black Silver ore, (p. 86), iron black, and giving an iron black powder ; 6, Kerargyrite or Horn Silver, (p. 92), resembling a dark colored gray or greenish wax, and cutting like wax ; 7, Embolite or Chloro-bromid of Sil ver, (p. 93), like the last, but more greenish. These ores yield silver easily, when heated on charcoal. Besides these, Tetrahedrite or Gray Copper, (p. 82), is often a valuable silver ore ; Galena, (p. 39), which, although seldom yielding over seventy five ounces to the ton, affords a considerable part of the silver of commerce. For other rarer silver ores, see pp. 16, 35, 43, 44, 48, 64, 71, 74, 76, 85, 87, 95. COPPER. \u2014 The more valuable species are: 1, Native Copper, (p. 17); 2, Chalco pyrite or Copper pyrites, (p. 68), of a brass yellow color, scratched easily with the point of a knife blade and giving a greenish black powder ; 3, Barnhardtite,( p. 500), and Cuban, (p. 68), which are similar to the last but paler : 4, Erubescite or Purple Copper, (p. 38), pale yellowish, with a slight coppery tinge, but tarnishing external ly to purple, blue, and reddish tints ; easily scratched with a knife blade, and pow der grayish ; 5, Copper Glance or Vitreous Copper, (p. 46), of a dark lead-gray col or, and powder similar, resembling some silver ores, but yielding copper and not silver, when heated ou charcoal; 6, Tetrahedrite or Gray Copper, (p. S2), of a some what paler steel-gray color and powder ; 7, Red Copper, (p. lol) ; 8, Black Copper , (p. 109, 136) ; 9, Malachite or Green Carbonate of Cojtper, (p. 458), of a bright green color, 60metime3 earthy in the fracture and sometimes silky ; 10, Azurite or Blue Mal achite, (p. 459), of a rich deep blue color, either earthy or vitreous in lustre. All the above are acted on by nitric acid, and the solution deposits a red coating of copper on a strip of polished iron ; 11, Chrysocolla, (p^09), a silicate of copper, resembling the Green Carbonate, but paler green, and usually having a close texture, (never fibrous), a smoother surface and somewhat waxy lustre, although occurring usually only as an incrustation; 12, Atacamite or Chlorid of Copper, (p. 138), of deeper green than Malachite ; 13, Sulphate of Copper, in solution, (p. 380). For rarer ores, see pages 36, (arsenical) ; 43, (selenid); 48, 65, 73, 80, 82, 84, 86, 87, (different sulphur, arsenical and antimonial ores); 309, (silicate) ; 360, 362, 368, (chromates, vanadate) ; 375, 380, (sulphates) ; 412, 420, 421, 425, (phosphates and arsenates). QUICKSILVER.\u2014 The only valuable ore is Cinnabar, (p. 48), of a bright red to brownish black color, with always a red powder, and affording fumes of quicksilver"], [843, "515 ANNOTATED INDEX. when heated on charcoal. There are also Native Quicksilver, (p. 14); Amalgam, (p. 15) ; Selenid, (p. 52) ; Chlorid and lodid, (p. 89, 96). Tetrahedrite (p. 82) some times contains this metal. LEAD.\u2014 Galena (p. 39) is the only abundant lead ore; it is a lead-gray brittle ore, yielding lead, when heated with charcoal. For other ores see pp. 42, 44, 66, (Selenid and Tellurids) ; 109, 117, 126, 127, 128, (Oxyds); 859, 361, 362, (Chromate and Vanadate); 348, (Tungstate); 370, 371, 372, 374, 375, 390, (Sulphates), of which Anglesite (p. 370) i6 the common one; 400, 401, (phosphate and arsenate) ; 452, (carbonate). ZINC. \u2014 The most important ores are: 1, Smithsonite or Carbonate of Zinc, (p. 447), and 2, Calamine or silicate of Zinc, (p. 313) ; they are alike in a white, gray ish-white, or greenish-white color, commonly a slight waxy lustre and smooth look, (often stalactitic or mammillary), yet sometimes earthy; and a hardness such that the surface is scratched with a'knife blade with some little difficulty. They differ in their action with muriatic acid ; when the surface is drusy, the silicate shows projections of minute rectangular prisms. Zincite or Red Zinc ore, (p. 110), is also important; it is bright red and very distinctly foliated. Blende or Sulphu ret of Zinci (p. 45), is a common ore, having a yellow to black color and resinous lustre, and distinctly cleavable ; the black varieties are sometimes a little metallic in lustre, but the powder is nearly or quite white. For other Zinc Ores, see pp. 127, (oxysulphuret); 156, 189, (silicate); 384, (sulphate); 409, (phosphate); 418, (arsenate) ; 460, carbonate). COB.ALT, NICKEL. \u2014 The ores of cobalt of first importance are, Smaltine, (p. 56), and Cobaltine, (p. 57), both of nearly a tin-white color, with the powder grayish black, color sometimes verging slightly to gray. The Black Oxyd of Cobalt, (p. 136), a kind of bog ore and very impure, is sometimes sufficiently abundant to be valuable. The useful ores of nickel are Chloanthite or the nickeliferous smaltine, (p. 56), Gersdorffite or Nickel Glance, (p. 58), and Copper Nickel, (-p. 52), the latter distinguished by a pale copper red color. For other ores of Cobalt, see pp. 41, 44, 63, 67, (sulphuret or arseniuret) ; 385, (sulphate) ; 416, (arsenate) ; 461, (carbonate) ; of Nickel, 42, 49, (sulphuret) ; 53, 59, (arsenical or antimonial) ; 339, (silicate) ; 386, (sulphate); 418, (arsenate) ; 461, (carbonate). MANGANESE. \u2014 Common, as Pyrolusite, (p. 125), and Psilomelane. (p. 135), both black or grayish-black ores, and having little lustre, and a blackish streak or pow der, in which last particular they are distinct from the iron ore called Limonite, with which they are often associated, and also from Hematite or Specular Iron. Wad (p. 136) is an earthy bog manganese, sometimes abundant and valuable. Manganite (p. 130) is abundant in certain mines, but is of little value in the arts, because of its containing so little oxygen, (one third less than Pyrolusite), to which fact Beud ant alludes in his name for the species, Acerdese ; it differs from pyrolusite in its reddish-b*own powder. For other manganese ores, see pp. 41, 56, (sulphuret); 53, (arsenical); 117, 118, (oxyds); 167, 186, (silicates); 399, 406, 408, (phosphates); 446, 452, (carbonate). CHROMIUM. \u2014 Chromic Iron, (p. 106), a grayish-black little lustrous ore, occur ring mostly in Serpentine, is the source of chrome in the arts. For different chrom ates, see p. 359. IRON. The important iron ores are : 1, Hematite or Specular Iron, (the aiparirm or bloodstone of Theophrastus), (p. 113), characterized by its blood-red powder, and occurring either earthy and red, or metallic and dark steel gray ; in the latter con dition very hard, a knife point making no impression ; \u2014 2. Magnetite, or magnetic iron ore, (p. 105), as hard as the preceding, but having a black powder, and being attractable by a magnet; \u2014 3, Limonite, called also brown hematite, (p. 131), a softer hydrous ore, affording a brownish yellow powder, earthy or semimetallic in appear ance and often in mammillary or stalactitic forms ; \u2014 4, Chalybite, or Spathic Iron, (p. 444), a sparry ore, of grayish, grayish-brown, and brown colors, very distinctly cleavable, turning brown to black on exposure. The common clayey iron ores are"], [844, "516 ANNOTATED INDEX. impure ores, either of Spathic Iron, Limonite, or Hematite ; when the last they are red; when brown, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown to black, they may be either ofthe two former. One of the most common ores of iron is Pyrites or sul phuret of iron, (p. 54), a pale yellow brass-like ore, hard enough to strike fire with steel, and thus unlike any copper ore, and all similar ores of other metals. Marcas ite (p. 60) is similar, but is prismatic and often crested in its forms. Pyrrhotine, or Magnetic Pyrites, (p. 50), is less hard and paler, or more grayish in color. Leuco pyrite aud Mispickel, (pp. 61, 62), are white metallic arsenical ores, somewhat re sembling ores of Cobalt. Ilmenite, or Titanic Iron, (p. 115), resembles specular iron closely, but has not a red powder; it is abundant in some regions, but not valued. For other iron ores see pp. 380, 385, 387, 389, (Sulphates); 399, 406-408, 416, 424, 427, 431, (phosphates) ; 422, (arsenate); 464, (oxalate). TIN. \u2014 The only valuable ore is the Oxyd of Tin or Cassiterite, (p. 118), a very hard mineral of a dark brown to black color, sometimes gray or grayish-brown, without any metallic appearance ; the crystals usually have a very brilliant lus tre. Tin also occurs as a sulphuret, (p. 70), and is sparingly found in ores of tan talum, and some other mineral species. TITANIUM.\u2014 The only ore of this metal of any value is Rutile, (p. 120). ARSENIC. \u2014 Native Arsenic (p. 22) is one source of arsenic, but it is too rare to be of much avail ; also Orpiment, (p.32 ), a sulphur-yellow foliaceous and some what pearly mineral, and Realgar, (p. 31), bright red and vitreous. Arsenic is mostly derived for the arts from the arsenical ores of iron, cobalt, and nickel. ANTIMONY. \u2014 Stibnite, or Gray Antimony, (p. 33), is the source ofthe antimony of commerce. It is a lead gray ore, usually fibrous or in prismatic crystals, and distinguished from a similar ore of manganese by its perfect diagonal cleavage and its easy fusibility. Antimony occurs also in numerous ores of lead and silver, (p. 72), and of nickel, (pp. 53, 59) ; also as oxyds, 140, 141. BISMUTH. \u2014 Native Bismuth, (p. 20), the source of the metal in the arts, is whitish, with a faint reddish tinge, has a perfect cleavage, and is very fusible. For other bismuth ores, see pp. 16,21, 33, 44, 73,77,81,88; 141, (oxy d) ; 181, (silicate) ; 462, (carbonate)."], [845, "GENERAL INDEX.* Abichite, 428. Abrazite, 322. Acadiolite, 319. Acerdese, 130.
