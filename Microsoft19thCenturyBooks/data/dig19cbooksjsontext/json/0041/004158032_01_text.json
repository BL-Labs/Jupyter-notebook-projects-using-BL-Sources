The first dramatic exhibitions were on religious subjects, they were acted by persons connected with the Church. Geoffrey was invited to preside over the school at St. Alban's ; but he not coming in time, another per- son was appointed to the situation, and Geoffrey in consequence read lectures at Dunstable. During the time he was there, he made a play on the story of St. Katharine: for the purpose of exhibiting it, he boiTOwed certain copes from the Abbey of St. Alban. On the night after the play, his house was burnt, with his books and the aforesaid copes. Geoffrey, not knowing how to make Heaven and St. Alban amends for this loss, thought the best way would be to turn monk, which he did at St. Alban's : in 1119 he became Abbot. (Matthew Paris.) The play was acted several years before, and seems to have been the first ever acted in England. VOL. I. B"], [12, "2 Before the suppression of the monasteries, Co ventry was famous for the pageants that were played there on Corpus Christi day : they were acted with great state and reverence by the Grey Friars, who had theatres for the several scenes, very large and high, placed upon wheels, and drawn to all the prin cipal parts of the city, for the better advantage of the spectators. (Historia Histrionica.) Hawkins and Dodsley have reprinted some of our earliest dramas. The scriptural and religious plays were called Mysteries, the moral plays were called Moralities. Malone says, \" The time is not exactly fixed at \" which Moralities gave way to the introduction of \" regular Tragedies and Comedies. Perhaps this \" change was not effected on a sudden, but the \" audiences were to be gradually weaned from their \" accustomed modes of amusement.\" Gammer Gurton's Needle used to be considered as our first regular Comedy, but it now appears that Ralph Royster Doyster was written before it. Malone says, \" There are but 34 regular plays \" now extant, which were printed before 1592, when \" there is good reason to believe Shakspeare had \" commenced dramatic writer. Between 1592 and \" 1600, 24 more plays were published or exhibited, \" some of which were probably written before any \" of Shakspeare's.\" The prologue to Dryden's alteration of Troilus and Cressida was spoken by Betterton, as repre senting the Ghost of Shakspeare. Dryden makes him say, \" I found not, but created first the Stage.\""], [13, "3 Dr. Johnson observes, \" The greater part of \" Shakspeare's excellence was the product of his \" own genius. He found the English stage in a \u2022\u2022 state of the utmost rudeness ; neither character \" nor dialogue were yet understood. Shakspeare \" may be said to have introduced them both among \" us, and in some of his happier scenes to have \" carried them both to their utmost height.\" Dr. Johnson was probably but little acquainted with the plays written before those of Shakspeare. Dryden's assertion is certainly wrong. Shakspeare did not create the stage ; he only improved what he found. Some of the 34 plays enumerated by Malone as written before 1592, are as regular plays as those of Shakspeare, whatever difference there may be between them in other points. Most, if not all, of Shakspeare's plays were per formed at the Globe, or the Theatre in Blackfriars. It appears that they both belonged to the same company of comedians, viz. his' Majesty's servants; which title they assumed after a license had been granted them by James the 1st in 1603, having been before that time called the servants of the Lord Chamberlain. The Theatre in Blackfriars was a private house. What were the peculiar and distinguishing marks of a private playhouse it is not easy to ascertain ; we only know that it was very small. The Globe, which was on the southern side of the Thames, was partly open to the weather, and partly covered with reeds : it was a public Theatre, and of a considerable size. Many of our ancient dramatic pieces were per- b2"], [14, "I. formed iu the yards of Carriers' Inns, in which, in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the come- dians, who then first united themselves into compa- nies, erected an occasional stage. The galleries were, as in our modern theatres, ranged over each other, on three sides of the building. The small rooms, under the lowest of the galleries, answer to our pre- sent boxes; and these, even after regular theatres were built, still retained their old name, and are fre- quently called rooms by our ancient writers. The yard bore a sufficient resemblance to the pit as at present in use; and we may suppose the stage to have been raised in this area, with its back to the gateway of the inn, at which the money for admis- sion was taken. Thus, in fine weather, a playhouse, not incommodious, might have been formed. Hence in the middle of the Globe, and probably in other jrublic theatres in the time of Shakspeare, there was an open yard, or area, where the common people stood to see the exhibition ; from which circumstance they are called by Shakspeare, groundlings ; and by Ben Jonson, the understanding gentlemen of the ground. In 1646, it appears that there were seats in the pit of the private playhouses. The galleries, or scaffolds, as they are sometimes called, and that part of the house which in private theatres was named the pit, seem to have been of the same price; and, probably, in houses of reputa tion, such as the Globe and Blackfriars, the price of admission into those parts of the theatre was six pence, while in some meaner playhouses it was only a penny, and in others two-pence. The price of admission into the best rooms, or boxes, was seem-"], [15, "5 ingly, in Shakspeare's time, a shilling, though after wards it appears to have risen to two shillings and half-a-crown. Malone supposes that the Globe was capable of containing as many persons as would produce some what more than \u00a335 ; but that \u00a320 was probably esteemed a considerable receipt, as the whole com pany received but half that sum for the exhibition of a play at Court. From several passages in our old plays, we learn that spectators were admitted on the stage, and that the critics and wits of the time usually sat there ; some were placed on the ground, others sat on stools, the price of which was either sixpence or a shilling, probably according to the commodiousness of the situation ; and they were attended by pages with pipes and tobacco, which was smoked here as well as in other parts of the house. Yet it should seem that persons were suffered to sit on the stage only in private playhouses, (such as Blackfriars, Sec.) where the audience was more select, and of a higher class ; and that at the Globe, and other public theatres, no such licence was permitted. This custom of sitting and lying on the stage accounts for Shakspeare's placing Hamlet at Ophelia's feet during the representation of the play. What some did from \u0153conomy, others might choose from gal lantry. The stage was strewed with rushes, which, at that time, was the usual covering of floors in England. The curtain was not drawn up by lines and pullies, but opened in the middle, and was drawn backward and forward on an iron rod. (Malone.) It has been doubted whether, in our ancient"], [16, "6 theatres, there were side and other scenes. Steevens is of opinion that they were not unfurnished with scenes, and assigns his i-easons for so thinking ; but Gifford wonders how he could so strenuously contend for a most hopeless cause. Malone is inclined to be lieve that the mechanism of the ancient stage seldom went beyond a painted chair or a trap-door ; that few, if any, theatres had any moveable scenes ; and that, in general, they were only furnished with cur tains, and a single scene composed of tapestry. In the early part of dramatic exhibitions, the want of scenery seems to have been supplied by the simple expedient of writing the names of the different places where the scene was laid in the progress of the play, which were disposed in such a manner as to be visible to the audience. How little the imagination of the spectators was assisted by scenical deception, and how much ne cessity Shakspeare had to call on them to \" piece \" out imperfections with their thoughts,\" may be collected from what Sir Philip Sidney says of the stage in his time. \" Now you shall see three ladies \" walk to gather flowers, and then we must believe \" the stage to be a garden. By and bye we hear \" news of a shipwreck in the same place, and then \" we are to blame if we accept it not for a rock. \" Upon the back of that comes out a hideous mon \" ster, with fire and smoke, and then the miserable \" beholders are bound to take it for a cave; while, \" in the mean time, two armies fly in, represented \" with four swords and bucklers, and then what \" hard heart will not receive it for a pitched field?\" (Malone.)"], [17, "1 Malone tells us, that towards the rear of the stage there appears to have been a balcony, the platform of which seems to have been eight or ten feet from the ground, and probably supported by pillars. From hence, in many of our old plays, part of the dialogue was spoken ; and in the front of this balcony curtains were likewise hung. In many of the old plays there is a stage direction for such and such characters to enter above. The old writers sometimes make use of this upper stage in a most absurd manner ; for instance, Shak speare makes the Ghosts first address Richard the Third, and then Richmond, as if it had been possible for them to have been both within hearing at the same time. The stage dresses, it is reasonable to suppose, were much more costly at some theatres than others, yet the wardrobe even at the Globe and Blackfriars was but scantily furnished. In Ben Jonson's Staple of News, acted by the King's servants in 1 625, it is said, \" O Curiosity ! you come to see who wears the \" new suit to day ; whose cloaths are best pen'd, \" whatever the part be ; which actor has the best leg \" and foot ; what king plays without cuffs, and his \" queen without gloves ; who rides post in stockings, \" and dances in boots. It was a general practice in the time of Shakspeare to sell the copy of the play to the theatre, in which case it usually remained for several years unpub lished. (Malone.) Thomas Heywood, who was an author and actor, assigns as a reason why more of his plays had not been published, that some of them were still retained"], [18, "8 in the hands of the actors, who thought it against their profit to have them come into print. (Lang baine.) Even in 1668, Sir Charles Sidley says, in the Mulberry Garden, \u2022\u2022 few plays gain audience by \" being in print.\" ., \u2022 But when the author did not sell his piece to the theatre, he printed it for sale : the customary price of the copy of a play in the time of Shakspeare appears to have been 20 nobles, or \u00a36 : 13 : 4. The play when printed was sold for sixpence ; and the usual present from a patron, in return for a dedica tion, was 40 shillings. On the first day of exhibiting a new play, the prices appear to have been raised : and this seems to have been occasionally practised on the benefit nights of authors to the end of the 17th century. Dramatic poets in those times, as at present, were admitted gratis into the theatre. Both the prompter, or book-holder as he is some times called, and the property-man appear to have been regular appendages to our ancient theatres. The principal actors formerly played on shares, as it is called ; that is, they divided the profits of the exhibition daily in various proportions among them, as is yet the practice of itinerant companies in the country \u2014 their inferiour actors were retained by the name of hirelings at a weekly salary that was paid by the sharers. Each sharer was entitled to have a boy, who played either young or female characters, and for whose services he received a certain sum. The sharers were usually not more than twelve. (Malone.) When Gosson wrote his \u00ab School of Abuse,\" in"], [19, "'I 1579, it seems that plays were usually acted on Sundays \u2014 afterwards they were performed on that and other days indiscriminately. Gosson says, \" The \" players, because they are allowed to play every \" Sunday, make 4 or 5 Sundays at least in eveiy \" week.\" (Malone.) Malone observes, \" From the silence of Prynne \" on this subject, it has been supposed that the \" practice of exhibiting plays on the Lord's day was \"discontinued in 1633; but I doubt whether this \" conjecture be well founded, for it appears from a \" contemporary writer, that it had not been abo \" lished in the 3d year of King Charles the 1st. \" And seldom have they leisure for a play \" Or masque, except upon God's holiday.\" But if plays had been commonly allowed on Sun days, Prynne would doubtless have made that his chief argument against the stage \u2014 besides, Prynne himself allows (p. 642) that there were seldom any plays or masques at Court even upon Saturday nights. Prynne. In 1633, Prynne published his famous book. It is a quarto of 1006 pages. The title-page contains a good Epitome of what follows. \" Histrio mastix. The '\u2022 Player's Scourge, or Actor's Tragedy. * * Wherein \" is largely evidenced, by divers arguments, by the \" authorities of sundry texts of scripture, * * of 55 \" Synods, of 71 Fathers, &c. &c. that stage plays are \" sinful, heathenish, lewd, ungodly spectacles, and '\u2022most pernicious corruptions; condemned, in all"], [20, "10 \" ages, as intolerable mischiefs to Churches, to Re \" publics, to the manners, minds, and souls of men ; \" and that the profession of play-poets, of stage \" players, together with the penning, acting, and \" frequenting of stage-plays, are unlawful, infamous, \" and misbecoming Christians. * * * Besides sundry \" other particulars concerning Dancing, Dicing, \" Health-drinking, &c. By William Prynne, an \" Utter Ban-ester of Lincoln's Inn.\" Prynne, instead of dividing his book into chapters, hath divided it into what he is pleased to call acts and scenes. He usually begins each scene with a syllogism. The essence of his own book may be comprised in one syllogism. Whatever has been condemned by the Fathers and Councils ought not to be tolerated in a Christian country. But the Stage has been condemned by the Fathers and Councils. Therefore the Stage ought not to be tolerated. To this there is a short answer\u2014 true Protestants are bound by no authority but that of reason and the scriptures. It is evident from Prynne's book that he was a man of great learning, but little judgment\u2014 of sour and austere principles, without one atom of candour\u2014 of the perverseness of his understanding there can be no doubt\u2014 he gravely argues, that players are by then profession hypocrites, and that all acting is hypocrisy : \u2014he is so absurd as to attribute the fall of the scaffolds in Paris Garden, not to the crowd of persons who were on them, but to the miraculous interposition of heaven."], [21, "11 Prynne was cited in the Star Chamber, Feb. 7, 1633-4. Mr. Attorney Noy stated, that although Prynne knew very well that the Queen, the Lords of the Council, &c., were sometimes spectators of masques, dances, &c, yet he had railed, not only against stage-plays, dancing, &c. but against all such as behold them ; that in his libel he had made use of infamous terms against his Majesty; had cast an aspersion on the Queen; and railing and uncharitable censures against all Christian people. It appears that Prynne was so far from conceiving his book to be a libel, that he had presented a copy to Noy himself. Prynne was sentenced to stand in the pillory in two places, to lose both his ears, to pay a heavy fine, and to be imprisoned for life. Neale, in his History of the Puritans, says very properly, \" Prynne's book is a very tedious and heavy \" performance, so that it was not calculated to in \" vite many to read it. This circumstance shows \" the weakness, as the severity of the punishment \" does the wickedness, of those who treated him \" with such barbarity.\" ACTORS. \u2022\u2022 Historia Histrionica : an Historical Account of \" the English Stage; Shewing the ancient Use, Im \" provement, and Perfection of Dramatick Repre-"], [22, "12 \" sensations in this Nation.

Chalmers has collected some information about the old actors, but it relates chiefly to their private transactions, and is consequently of no great im portance.

(Shakspeare, Vol. 1st.) Of the old actors much has not been recorded. Sir Richard Baker says of Tarlton, that for Clown's parts he never had his equal, nor ever will. Heywood tells us that Kempe succeeded Tarlton in the favour and good thoughts of the audience \u2014 in the Return from Parnassus he is made one of the D. P., and represented as grossly illiterate. Burbage was the original Richard the 3d\u2014 Flecknoe in his Short Discourse of the English stage 1664, says of him \u2014 \" He was a delightful Proteus, so wholly \" transforming himself into his pai-t, and putting off \" himself with his cloaths, as he never (not so much \" as in the tyring-house) assumed himself again, \u2022\u2022 until the play was done\u2014 he had all the parts of \" an excellent orator, animating his words with \" speaking, and speech with action: his auditors \" being never more delighted than when he spake, \" nor more sorry than when he held his peace: yet \" even then he was an excellent actor still, never \" falling in his part, when he had done speaking, but \" with his looks and gesture maintaining it still unto \" the height.\" Shakspeare is generally considered as having been a much better poet than a player\u2014 Hemings is said to have been a Tragedian \u2014 and Condel a Comedian. Edward Alleyn was Master of a Company of his own, for whom he built the Fortune playhouse from the ground, a large round brick building \u2014 he grew so rich that he purchased a great estate in Surrey and elsewhere ; and having no issue he built and largely endowed Dulwich College in 1619, for a master,"], [24, "14 warden, 4 fellows, 12 aged poor people, and 12 poor boys. (H. H.) On the revival of the Jew of Malta at the Cockpit, the Prologue says that the Jew was originally acted by Alleyn, the best actor of his time \u2014 \" Whom we may rank with (doing no one wrong) \" Proteus for shapes, and Roscius for a tongue.\" Green, who belonged to the Red Bull, was an ex cellent Clown \u2014 see Green's Tu quoque L. I. F. 1665. On the death of Burbage in 1619, and the retire ment of Hemings and Condell in or about 1623, Lowin and Taylor became the principal performers in the King's Company \u2014 Taylor is mentioned in the Parson's Wedding, p. 138. Richard Robinson was a Comedian \u2014 he had acted female parts originally \u2014 he is particularly mentioned in the Devil is an Ass \u2014 Cowley in the dedication of Love's Riddle, 1638, says \u2014 \" Nor has't a part for Robinson, whom they \" At school account essential to a play.\" Stephen Hamerton acted Amintor to Lowin's Melantius ; he was at first a most noted and beau ful woman actor, but afterwards performed with equal grace and applause a young lover's part. (H. H.) In the Parson's Wedding p. 154, it is said \" Stephen is as handsome when the play is done, \" as Mr. Wild was in the scene * * * if you refuse, \" Stephen misses the Wench, and then you cannot \"justly blame the poet, for you, know they say that"], [25, "15 \"alone is enough to spoil the play\" \u2014 and in the Epilogue to the Goblins \u2014 \" Oh if Stephen should be killed ! \" Or miss the Lady, how the plot is spilled ! \" Swanston used to play Othello \u2014 (H.

(H. H.) William Rowley was an actor and an author \u2014 he seems to have belonged, first to the Lady Elizabeth's company at the Swan, and then to the Cockpit \u2014 see the title-page to All is lost by Lust \u2014 he acted Jaques in that play \u2014 a comic character. Hart and Clun were bred up boys at Blackfriars? and acted women's parts \u2014 Hart was Robinson's boy or apprentice \u2014 he acted the Duchess in the Tragedy of the Cardinal, which was the first part that give him reputation \u2014 Cartwright and Wintershal belonged to the private house in Salisbury Court \u2014 Burt was a boy, first under Shanke at Blackfriars and then under Beeston at the Cockpit \u2014 Mohun and Shatterel were in the same condition with him at the last place \u2014there Burt used to play the principal female parts, particularly Clariana in Love's Cruelty ; and at the same time Mohun acted Bellamante, which part he retained after the Restoration.

The Rose Theatre was built by Philip Henslowe\u2014 the total cost of it was \u00a3103 : 2 : 7\u2014 it was thatched and, from the price it cost, was probably very slight \u2014 it fell into decay about the middle of King James' reign \u2014 there is no trace of it in the map of London in 1629- (Malone.) Alleyn the actor married Joan Woodward, the daughter of Henslowe's wife : this fact explains how the account books of Henslowe, which have illus trated so many obscure points, in theatrical history, came to Dulwich College. (Chalmers.) The Hope \u2014 Bartholemew Fair came out at this theatre Oct. 31, 1614 \u2014 Ben Jonson in his Induction says \u2014 \" Though the Fair be not kept in the same \" region, that some here, perhaps, would have it ; \" yet think that therein the author has observed a \" special decorum, the place being as dirty as Smith *\" field, and as stinking every whit.\" Chalmers says that the Swan, the Rose, and the Hope were not much frequented, and fell into disuse early in the reign of James the 1st \u2014 this is evidently incorrect. The Globe was situated in Southwark nearly oppo site to Queen Street, Cheapside \u2014 it was burnt on St. Peter's day 1613 \u2014 but rebuilt in the following year. The theatre in Black-friars was situated some where near the present Apothecaries-Hall. (Malone.)

The Fortune was s'ituated in Golden Lane \u2014 it was built by Alleyn \u2014 Chalmers says it was burnt in 1617 \u2014 but it was afterwards rebuilt. The Red Bidl was situated in St. John Street \u2014 Davenant (probably in 1663) says \u2014 \" the Red Bull \" stands empty for fencers.\" The Cockpit, or Ph\u0153nix, was situated in Drury Lane \u2014 it was re-opened after the Restoration \u2014 Pepys saw the Cardinal at the Cockpit Oct. 2, 1662 \u2014 after which time we hear no more of it. White-friars \u2014 Chalmers says (from Howe's Chro- nicle) that this theatre was established in 1629 \u2014 Langbaine says that Bussy D'Ambois his Revenge was printed in 1613, and had often been presented mUt- <*** at the private house in Wliite-friars \u2014 the Widow's \u00ab ?\u00a3*-*\"& Tears, printed in 1612, is said to have been often *\u2022\u00bb mtUf^ acted at Black and White-friars\u2014 but Prynne, in /\u00ab./**\u25a0 /ff\"* his epistle dedicatory 1633, expressly calls White- eiTaJ-u*&J '\u25a0 friars a new theatre. / - Salisbury Court \u2014 Isaac Reed supposes that the theatre in White-friars, and that in Salisbury Court were the same theatre\u2014 he does not confirm his opinion by any argument, but there is a passage in Prynne which puts the matter beyond all reasonable doubt \u2014 in the dedication of his Histriomastix he says \u2014 \" Two old playhouses (the Fortune and Red \" Bull) have lately been re-edified and enlarged, \" and one new one (White-friars) erected \u2014 the \" multitude of our London play-haunters being so c"], [30, "20 \" augmented now, that all the ancient Devil's cha \" pels, (for so the Fathers stile all playhouses) being \" five in number, are not sufficient to contain their \" troupes, whence we see a sixth added to them.\" \u2014 On the supposition that Whitefriars and Salisbury Court were distinct theatres, there would have been not only 6, but 7 theatres in 1633 when Prynne pub- lished his book \u2014 Maitland in his Survey of London does not define how far Whitefriars extended, but he says sufficient to show that the theatre in Salisbury Court might be called the theatre in Whitefriars with little or no impropriety \u2014 his words are (vol. 2. p. 993)-\" The Priory of the Carmelites, or \" White Friars, stood on the south side of Fleet \" Street, between the New Temple and Salisbury \" Court.\" \u2014 This theatre was most commonly called Salisbury Court \u2014 but Pepys tells us, in 166 1, that he saw Betterton act at Whitefriars. Wright says that before the civil wars, there were five companies and six playhouses\u2014 the Black-friars and the Globe belonging to the same company called the King's Servants \u2014 the Cockpit or Ph\u0153nix in D. L. called the Queen's Servants \u2014 the private house in Salisbury Court, called the Prince's Servants\u2014 the Fortune \u2014 and the Red Bidl\u2014 the two last were mostly frequented by citizens, and the meaner sort of people. The Black-friars, Cockpit, and Salisbury Court were small, and were all three built almost exactly alike for form and bigness -here they had pits for the gentry, and acted by candlelight\u2014 the Globe, Fortune, and Bull were large houses, and lay partly"], [31, "21 open to the weather, and there they always acted by daylight. (H. H.) Wright says all these companies got money and lived in reputation. (H. H.)\u2014 Randolph in his Muse's Looking-glass mentions 5 of the 6 play houses, in a dialogue between Mrs. Flowerdew and Bird, two Puritans, who serve the Theatre with their wares. Flow. It was a zealous prayer I heard a brother make concerning playhouses. Bird. For charity, what is't. Flow. That the Globe Wherein (quoth he) reigns a whole world of vice, Had been consum'd ; the Ph\u0153nix burnt to ashes ; The Fortune whipt for a blind whore : Black-Fryers He wonders how it 'scaped demolishing I' th' time of reformation : lastly, he wish'd The Bull might cross the Thames to the Bear Garden, And there be soundly baited. Bird. A good prayer. Flow. Indeed it sometimes pricks my conscience, I come to sell them pins and looking-glasses. Bird. I have their custom too for all their feathers, 'Tis fit that we which are sincere professors Should gain by Infidels. The Puritans having the ascendancy in Parlia ment, an Act was passed Feb. 11. 1647 O. S. \"that \" all Stage Galleries seats and boxes should be pulled \" down by warrant of two Justices of the Peace\u2014 \" that all Actors of plays for the time to come, \" being convicted, should be publickly whipped :"], [32, "22 \" and all spectators of plays for every offence should \" pay five shillings.\" (Neale.) This was literally putting Prynne's Histriomastix into execution. When the Civil wars began, most of the players, except Lowin, Taylor, and Pollard, (who were super annuated) went into the King's Army\u2014 Robinson was killed by the well known Enthusiast Harrison, who refused him quarter, and shot him in the head after he had laid down his arms, saying at the same time \u2014 \" Cursed is he that doth the work of the Lord \" negligently\" \u2014 Mohun was a Captain, and after the Civil wars were over, served in Flanders, where he received pay as a Major \u2014 Hart was a Lieutenant of Horse in Prince Rupert's Regiment \u2014 Burt was Cornet in the same troop, and Shatterel quarter- master \u2014 Allen of the Cockpit was a Major, and quar- ter-master-general at Oxford \u2014 Swanston is said to be the only player of any note who sided with the other party ; he was a Presbyterian, and took up the trade of a Jeweller. (H. H.) Chalmers, after mentioning the story which Wright relates of Robinson, says \u2014 \" The fact, which \" is more creditable than the story, is that Richard \" Robinson died quietly at London in 1647 \u2014 as the \" Parish Register of St. Anne's Blackfriars ex- \" pressly records, that Richard Robinson, a Player, \" was buried on the 23d of March 1646-7, there \" can be little doubt about the identity of the per \" son\" \u2014 William Robins of the Cockpit seems to have been called William Robinson in the D. P. of the Fair Maid of the West\u2014 John Robinson's name"], [33, "23 in 1640 stands to a part in Messallina \u2014 it was per haps one of these actors whom Harrison killed, and whom Wright supposed to be Richard Robinson \u2014 the story may not be true, but it certainly wears a sti-ong appearance of probability. When the wars were over and the royalists totally subdued, most of the actors who survived, made up one company out of the wreck of several ; and in the winter of 1648 they ventured to act some plays, with as much caution and privacy as could be, at the Cock pit : they continued undisturbed for 3 or 4 days, but at last as they were acting the Bloody Brother (Rollo Duke of Normandy) \u2014 in which Lowin played Aubrey, Taylor Rollo, Pollard the Cook, Burt La-torch, and Hart (probably) Otto \u2014 a party of soldiers beset the house, surprised them about the middle of the play, and carried them away to prison dressed as they were ; where having detained them some time and plundered them of their cloaths, they set them at liberty \u2014 afterwards in Oliver's time they used to act privately, 3 or 4 miles or more out of town, some times at one place and sometimes at another \u2014 occa sionally at Noblemen's houses, in particular at Hol land House Kensington, where the Nobility and Gentry who met (but in no great numbers) made a collection for them : Alexander Goffe, the woman actor at Black Friars, used to be the person to give notice of time and place \u2014 at Christmas and Bartho lemew Fair they generally bribed the Officer who commanded at Whitehall, and were thereupon con nived at to act for a few days at the Red Bull ; but were sometimes notwithstanding disturbed by sol-"], [34, "24 diers \u2014 Some picked up a little money by publishing copies of plays never before printed, for instance in 1652 Beaumont and Fletcher's Wild Goose Chase was printed for the public use of all the ingenious, as the title page says, and the private benefit of John Lowin and Joseph Taylor, and by them dedi- cated to the honoured few lovers of dramatic poesy; wherein they modestly intimated their wants ; and that with sufficient cause, for they were now reduced to a necessitous condition \u2014 Lowin in his latter days kept the Three Pigeons at Brentford, where he died very old and very poor\u2014 Taylor died at Richmond and was there buried\u2014 Pollard, who lived single and had a competent estate, retired to some relations he had in the country\u2014 Perkins and Sumner of the Cockpit kept house together at Clerkenwell and were there buried\u2014 these all died some years before the Restoration. (Hist. Hist.) While the stage was suppressed, one Robert Cox, who was an excellent Comedian, betook himself to make certain drolls or farces ; these he found means to get performed by stealth under the pretence of rope dancing\u2014 in these drolls he used to perform the principal parts himself, and was a great favourite, both in London and the Country\u2014 he was so natural a performer, that after he had been playing the part of Simpleton the Smith at a Country Fair, a real smith of some eminence in those parts, who saw him act, came to him and offered to take him as his journey man, and even to allow him twelve pence per week more than the customary wages. (Langbaine.) In 1809 was published a print of the inside of the"], [35, "25 Red Bull Theatre\u2014 it was taken from the frontis piece to a collection of Drolls printed by Kirkman in 1672: the figures brought together on the stage, are intended as portraits of the leading actors in each Droll : the one playing Simpleton is Cox \u2014 this print may be considered not only as highly curious for the place it represents, but as an unique specimen of the interior \u0153conomy of our ancient English theatres."], [36, ""], [37, "SOME ACCOUNT OF THE 3SnQltjSty Stage from t*)e -Kestorattou IN 1660 TO 1830.

In Egerton's sale catalogue of Henderson's library, there was a manuscript copy of \" Davies' additions \" to Downes' Roscius Anglicanus\" \u2014 this was claimed as the property of the Honourable Mr. Byng, who had purchased it of Davies' widow ; and by whom it had been lent to Henderson \u2014 it was restored to that Gentleman, and by him entrusted to Waldron, with permission to make whatever use of it he might think proper. Waldron published a new edition of the Roscius Anglicanus in 1789, with Davies' notes and some by himself \u2014 the manner in which Waldron executed his undertaking was greatly to his discredit \u2014 his prin cipal blunders will be pointed out in their proper places. Samuel Pepys, who was Secretary to the Navy in the latter part of the reign of Charles the 2d, and in that of his brother, began a Diary on the 1st of January 1659-1660 \u2014 he continued it to May 31st 1669.\u2014 He left his library to Magdalen College Cam bridge \u2014 his Diary remained in Manuscript till 1825,"], [39, "29 when it was published (but not entire) under the superintendence of Lord Braybrooke \u2014 the theatrical intelligence contained in two large 4to.

Betterton being then about 22 years old (or 25 according to Southerne) was highly applauded for his acting in all these plays, but especially for the Loyal Subject, the Mad Lover, Pericles, the Bond man, and Deflores in the Changeling ; his voice was then as strong, full, and articulate as in the meridian of his acting \u2014 (Doivnes) \u2014 even at that time he gave a proof of the versatility of his talents \u2014 Deflores is a part which requires a first-rate actor, but it seems badly calculated for a young man \u2014 for the Change ling, see D. L. Nov. 7 1789. Sheppy performed Theodore in the Loyal Subject, Duke Altophil in the Unfortunate Lovers, Asotus in the Bondman, and several other parts very well ; but above all the Changeling with general satisfaction. Kynaston acted Arthiope in the Unfortunate Lovers, the Princess in the Mad Lover, Aglaura, Ismenia in the Maid in the Mill, and several other female parts : he being then very young made a com plete stage beauty, and performed some characters so well, especially Arthiope and Aglaura, that it was disputed among the judicious, whether any woman that succeeded him, touched the audience so sensibly as he had done."], [42, "32 The Maid in the Mill (Florimel) was acted first by James Nokes, and then by Angel : Aminta in the same play was acted by William Betterton, who not long after was drowned \u2014 they acted several other female characters in a manner very acceptable to the audience \u2014 Mosely and Floid commonly acted women of the lowest description.

Chalmers says that the theatre in Vere Street was opened on the 8th of November 1660 \u2014 on the suppo sition that the old actors began to act at the Red Bull, they must have acted at three different theatres in the course of some few months, which is very unlikely.

Scenes had been before used in private exhibitions \u2014 and Davenant had introduced them, probably in a less perfect state, about 4 years before, not indeed in a play, but in an entertainment entitled \" the cruelty \" of the Spaniards in Peru, expressed by vocal and \" instrumental music and by art of perspective in \" scenes\u2014 represented daily at the Cockpit in D.

Mrs. Davenport's name does not occur after this year \u2014 the story which Curll and Davies tell of Mrs. Marshal was probably true of Mrs. Davenport \u2014 the Memoirs of the Count de Grammont were translated by Boyer in 1714 \u2014 at p. 246, we have a story, which is briefly as follows\u2014 The Earl of Oxford fell in love with a handsome Player, belonging to the Duke's Theatre, who acted to perfection, particularly the part of Roxana in the Rival Queens, insomuch that she was afterwards called by that name \u2014 the Earl, not having succeeded in his attempts to seduce her, had recourse to the stratagem of marrying her by a sham Parson \u2014 when the cheat was discovered, she threw herself in vain at the King's feet, to demand justice\u2014 she was fain to rise up again without redress, and to be contented with an annuity of \u00a3300 \u2014 Curll, in his History of the Stage 1741, says Mrs. Marshall was more known by the name of Roxalana from her acting that part \u2014 he then gives an account of her sham marriage with the Earl of Oxford\u2014 it does not however appear that Mrs. Marshall acted Roxalana in any play \u2014 Davies in his Miscellanies, vol. 3. p. 278, repeats the story of Mrs. Marshall and Lord Oxford \u2014Malone supposes that Roxalana was Mrs. Daven port, who acted Roxalana in the Siege of Rhodes at L. I. F. in 1661, and Roxalana in Mustapha in 1663 \u2014this is highly probable\u2014 in a new translation of the Memoirs which was published in 1818, we find a material difference from Boyer's translation\u2014 we"], [59, "t. r. 1664. 49 there read that the actress, of whom the story is told, had acted \u2014 \"Roxana in a very fashionable new play\" \u2014 Boyer appears to have falsified the text in a most unjustifiable manner \u2014 he ought to have translated the words as he found them, and then have given his supposed information, as to the name of the play in a note \u2014 the author of the Memoirs had evidently forgotten the name of the play \u2014 he seems to have called the actress Roxana, by mistake, instead of Roxalana \u2014 the name of Roxana does not occur in any play that came out between the Restoration and I667, when the Rival Queens was printed \u2014 an actress in the Duke's Theatre could not possibly have acted Roxana in the Rival Queens, as that play came out at the King's Theatre \u2014 besides the Rival Queens was not written till some years after the pretended marriage \u2014 so that there seems no reason whatever for supposing that the actress mentioned in the Me moirs was Mrs. Marshall \u2014 and there is the strongest reason for concluding that she was Mrs. Davenport \u2014 Downes expressly says that Mrs. Davenport was erept the stage by love \u2014 she was probably decoyed into a sham marriage \u2014 and, as she had an annuity of \u00a3300 a year, she did not return to the stage \u2014 the very fashionable play was, in all probability, Mustapha.

Many plays in the titlepage state the date of their being licensed for printing ; which is a much better guide than the date of publication \u2014 not merely because the publication was sometimes delayed, but because the month as well as the year of the license is stated \u2014 the first edition of a play is not always to be met with \u2014 and in the second, the date of the license is frequently omitted.

Much of the success, which the Rehearsal met with, was, doubtless, owing to the mimickry em ployed \u2014 Dryden's dress and manner, and usual ex pressions, were all minutely copied, and the Duke of Buckingham took incredible pains in teaching Lacy to speak some passages in the part of Bayes \u2014 in these he probably imitated Dryden's mode of re citation, which was by no means excellent. (Malone.) It is said that this Satirical Farce was originally intended against Davenant \u2014 and likewise that Sir Robert Howard was once meant \u2014 the design was probably to ridicule the reigning poet, whoever he might be \u2014 there is still one passage which seems to relate to Davenant \u2014 Bayes hurts his nose and comes in with brown paper applied to the bruise \u2014 how this affected Dryden does not appear \u2014 Davenant's nose had suffered such diminution by mishaps among the women, that a patch upon that part evidently denoted him \u2014 (Dr. Johnson) \u2014 one of the characters in Albovine says \u2014 \" shortly you'll see him wear a \" curtain 'fore his nose, that's now the newest fashion \" that came from Paris\" \u2014 when Davenant wrote this, he probably did not think it would be his own case. Sir John Suckling in his Session of the Poets says \u2014 \" Will D'Avenant asham'd of a foolish mischance, \" That he had got lately travelling in France, \" Modestly hop'd the handsomeness of 's Muse \" Might any deformity about him excuse.\" \u2014 and \u2014"], [125, "T.

Dr. Johnson has observed that the Rehearsal is represented as ridiculing passages in plays, which were not published till after the Rehearsal\u2014\" these \" contradictions\" (says he) \" show how rashly satire \" is applied\" \u2014 Dr. Johnson was not aware, that some of these plays, though not published till after the Rehearsal, were yet acted before it \u2014 and that alterations and additions were made to the Rehearsal after its original publication.

Malone observes\u2014\" Dryden made no reply to the \" Rehearsal, for which he assigned his reasons in \" the dedication of Juvenal\" \u2014 the reasons which Dryden assigns are futile\u2014 his true reason probably was, that in I67I the Duke of Buckingham was a favourite at Court\u2014 when Dryden did attack the Duke, he knew that he should please the King by so doing- Malone adds \u2014 \" whatever might have been \" the success of the Rehearsal, it did not for some \" years banish rhyme from the stage, several heroick \" tragedies have been acted between 1672 and \u00ab I677\"\u2014 plays in rhyme were not totally banished from the stage till after 1706."], [127, "T.

The Duke of Buckingham was sometimes very happy in his expressions\u2014 speaking of Charles the 2d and his brother, he said\u2014\" the King could see things, \" if he would\u2014 the Duke would see things, if he \" could\"\u2014 Instead of cursing a dog that had bitten him, he wished him married and settled in the country.

The now populous Strand and Fleet Street formed the cold bleak road here described. (Malone.) Even in 1696 Powell, in the Prologue to Bonduca revived, says that they are bringing their machines scenes &c. from Dorset Garden to Brydges Street \u2014 \" from the chiller, bleaker Strand, \" To your sweet Covent Garden's warmer land.\" In a petition presented to Queen Anne in 1709 it is stated that this new Theatre cost near \u00a34000 \u2014 and that the old Theatre with that in Dorset Garden cost above \u00a310,000. (Dramatic Censor 1811. ) The last line of the Prologue of course refers to the success of the Tempest at D. G., which was so great that it was thought worth while to bring out at the T.

D. G. 1674. Psyche Downes says this long expected Opera came out in Feb. 1673, that is in Feb. 1673-4. To Apuleius alone we are indebted for the story of Psyche, which he relates in the 4th, 5th and 6th books\u2014 in the 4th he tells us how he was metamor phosed into an ass, and in the 11th how he reco vered his shape by the eating of some roses\u2014Apu leius has borrowed a considerable part of his Ass m2"], [174, "164 d. g. 1674. from Lucian's Ass\u2014 but he has omitted the very ludicrous circumstance with which Lucian concludes his story \u2014 Apuleius' work is frequently called the Golden Ass\u2014 but the Delphine Editor says that the proper title is the Metamorphosis of Apuleius, or the Tale of the Ass. The story of Psyche has been dramatized by Hey wood, Moliere and Shadwell \u2014 Heywood's play is called Love's Mistress, or the Queen's Masque \u2014 it was printed in 1636, and reprinted in 1792 \u2014 the 2d title is added from its having been acted at Court. Moliere's Psyche was acted at Paris in I67I \u2014 an Oracle is given that Psyche should be exposed on the top of a mountain, and there wait for a poisonous serpent, who is to be her husband \u2014 Zephyrus flies away with her, and carries her to the palace, which Cupid had caused to be built for her \u2014 Cupid makes love to Psyche \u2014 she falls in love with him \u2014 Psyche desires to see her sisters \u2014 they envy her, and per suade her to find out who her lover is \u2014 she asks a favour of Cupid \u2014 he swears by Styx to grant it \u2014 she explains her request \u2014 Cupid wishes her to wave his promise \u2014 curiosity makes her persist \u2014 Cupid tells her who he is \u2014 but is offended and leaves her.

Cupid's shoulder, and he wakes with the pain \u2014 in all these particulars Heywood nearly follows the original story \u2014 in the first interview between Cupid and Psyche, Cupid's hand only is seen with a wed ding ring on it \u2014 the words are spoken from behind the scenes \u2014 Moliere's alteration is for the worse \u2014 in Apuleius Psyche's motives for curiosity are almost irresistible \u2014 in the French piece, she sees Cupid and loves him, yet she sacrifices all her happiness for the sake of gratifying her curiosity in a point, compa ratively speaking, of no great moment. Shadwefl's play is chiefly taken from the French piece, but with some additions \u2014 Moliere's Psyche is pleasing \u2014 Shadvvell's is dull \u2014 Heywood's play is by far the best of the three, as he has made some happy additions to the story \u2014 Psyche is the Greek word for the Soul \u2014 Dr. Jortin observes that this elegant story is undoubtedly mystical and allegorical \u2014 and as such Heywood has treated it \u2014 in his first scene Apu leius asks Midas the way to the temple of the Muses \u2014Midas speaks of the Muses with contempt, but is prevailed on by Apuleius to stay and see the story of Cupid and Psyche represented\u2014 as the play proceeds, Apuleius explains to Midas that by Psyche is meant the soul\u2014 by Venus intemperate lust\u2014 by Cupid true desire, &c. Heywood has likewise introduced the contention between Apollo and Pan\u2014 they contend by deputies \u2014Apollo's deputy sings a serious song in his praise, the Clown a ludicrous one in praise of Pan \u2014 \" Thou that art called the bright Hyperion, ******** \" Compare not with our great god Pan."], [176, "166 d. g 1674. \" They call thee son of bright Latona, \" But girt thee in thy torrid zona, \" Sweat, haste and broil, as best thou can, \" Thou art not like om- Dripping Pan. \" Then thou that art the heaven's bright eye, \" Or burn, or scorch, or boil, or fry, \" Be thou a god, or be thou man, \" Thou art not like our Frying Pan. \" They call thee Ph\u0153bus, god of day, \" Years, months, weeks, hours of March and \" May ; \" Bring up thy army in the van, \" We'll meet thee with our Pudding Pan. \" Thyself in thy bright chariot settle, \" With skillet arm'd, brass pot or kettle, \" With jug, black-pot, with glass or can, \" No talking to our Warming Pan.\" Midas adjudges the victory to Pan \u2014 \" Thy Harp to Pan's Pipe, yield good Ph\u0153bus, \" For 'tis not now as in Diebus \" Mis, Pan all the year we follow, \" But semel in anno ridet Apollo.\" It was probably the perusal of this play which induced Langbaine (by a gross mistake) to refer his readers to Apuleius for the story of Midas. Shadwell's Psyche is printed without the names of the performers \u2014 it was splendidly set out with new scenes, machines, dresses, and French dances\u2014 the charge of the scenes amounted to above \u00a3800\u2014 it had"], [177, "d. g. 1374. 167 a continuance of performance for about 8 days, and proved very beneficial to the company; but it did not bring them so much money as the Tempest \u2014 (Doivnes) \u2014 Langbaine says, that in consequence of Psyche's being written in rhyme, most of the Crambo- Poets were up in arms against it, and looked upon Shadwell as an encroacher on their territories \u2014 from the dedication it appears that Shadwell was edu cated at Cambridge \u2014 a circumstance not noticed in the B.

Dryden 3 times uses the word Knight \u2014 Shakspeare also uses it \u2014 Steevens remarks that the word, as often as it occurs, is sure to bring with it the idea of Chi valry, and revives the memory of Amadis and his fantastic followers, rather than of the Greeks and Trojans \u2014 he wishes eques and armiger could have been translated by any other words than Knight and Squire.

Betterton had so just an apprehension of what was true or false applause, that Cibber had heard him say, he never thought any kind of it equal to an attentive silence ; that there were many ways of deceiving an audience into a loud one ; but to keep them husht and quiet was an applause, Avhich only truth and merit could arrive at \u2014 of Avhich art there never was an equal master with himself \u2014 Cibber never heard a line in Tragedy come from Betterton, Avherein his judgment, his ear, and his imagination were not fully satisfied \u2014 Betterton's voice was more suited to the rage of Othello than to the tenderness of Castalio \u2014 his person was suitable to his voice, more manly than SAveet \u2014 in speaking a Prologue he was superiour to any performer Cibber ever saAv. Kynaston, who about 30 years before had been very beautiful and acted female characters, Avas now remarkable for a piercing eye and a quick impetuous vivacity in his voice, Avhich painted the Tyrant truly terrible \u2014 particularly in Morat in Aureng Zebe, and Muley Moloch in Henry 4th when he whispered to Hotspur \u2014"], [503, "t. r. 1690. 493 \" Send us your Prisoners, or you'll hear of it \" He conveyed a more terrible menace than the loudest intemperance of voice could SAvell to\u2014 he Avas likeAvise very great in the scene Avith the Prince.

Sandford Avas an excellent actor in disagreeable characters, such as Creon, Malignii, Iago, and Machi avel\u2014into this line of acting he Avas throAvn rather by necessity than choice, as having a Ioav crooked person Cibber had often lamented that Sandford's masterly performance Avas not rewarded Avith that applause, Avhich inferiour actors met Avith, merely because they stood in more amiable characters\u2014"], [504, "494 t. r. 1690.
