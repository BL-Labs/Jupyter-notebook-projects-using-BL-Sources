THE Channel Pilot, Part 2, contains Sailing Directions for the northern coast of France, from Ushant to Dunkerque, together with the Channel Islands. The directions for the French coast were originally compiled from the Pilote Francais, edited by M. Givry from the valuable surveys made by M. Beautemps-Beaupre, between the years 1836-43 ; and also from the surveys of Captain Martin White, R.N., in the years 1812-29. The first edition of this work was compiled by Staff -Commander J. W. King, R.N., of the Hydrographic Department, Admiralty, from the above sources, and published in 1859. The directions for the Channel Islands were prepared by Staff- Commander John Richards during the Admiralty survey of those islands in the years 1859-70, and published in March, 1870. The second edition of Channel Pilot, Part 2, by Staff-Commander G. F. McDougall, R.N., of the Hydrographic Department, was published in December, 1 870 ; in this the Sailing Directions for the Channel Islands were embodied. The third edition, by Staff- Commander G. H. Allen, R.N., was published in 1875. The fourth edition, by Staff-Commander Hitchfield, R.N., of the Hydrographic Department, was published in 1882. The fifth edition by Captain E. H. Hills, R.N., was published in 1888. The present edition has also been prepared by Captain E. H. Hills, R.N., from the latest information available. By the publication of this edition all former editions and supple ments, together with all Hydrographic Notices or Notices to Mariners relating to Channel Pilot, Part 2, or to its supplements, up to and inclusive of No. 129 of 1897 are cancelled.

SHIPS. ON THE CORRECTION OF CHARTS, LIGHT LISTS, AND SAILING DIRECTIONS. There are three descriptions of publications as guides to naviga tion \u2014 the charts, the sailing directions, and the light lists \u2014 which are all affected by the continual changes and alterations that take place. Of these the charts should always be, so far as our knowledge permits, absolutely correct to date ; and the light lists should be noted for the recent alterations, though space will not permit of full details being always inserted ; the sailing directions, however, cannot, from their nature, be so corrected, and in all cases where they differ from charts, the charts must be taken as the guide. 1. Charts. \u2014 When issued to a ship on commissioning, the charts have received all necessary corrections to date. As sent from the Hydrographic Office they are, as a rule, fresh from the plates. They then receive such corrections by hand in the depots as are required, and are so issued to the ships. All small but important corrections that can be made by hand are notified by Notices to Mariners, and should at once be placed on the charts to which they refer.. Large corrections that cannot be conveniently thus made are put upon the plates, and fresh copies are issued to the ships to replace the others, which are directed to be destroyed to prevent the possibility of their being used in the navigation of the ship.

VIII The dates on which these large corrections are made are noted on the chart plates in the middle of the lower edge ; those of the smaller corrections at the left-hand lower corners. In all cases of quotations of charts, these dates of corrections should be given, as well as the number of the chart (which will be found in the lower right-hand corner), in order that at the Admiralty it may be known what edition of the chart is referred to. 2. The Light Lists, annually published at the beginning of each year, are not corrected in the depots before issue, but appendices are issued every two months, giving the alterations that have taken place, copies of which are put into the chart boxes. It is the duty of the navigating officer when he receives the set of charts to make notations in the light lists from these appendices, and from the Notices to Mariners in the box ; and to keep them so corrected from time to time. The Light Lists should always be consulted as to the details of a light, as the description in the Sailing Directions may be obsolete, in consequence of changes made since publication. 3. The Sailing Directions are not corrected before issue, except occasionally for very important new rocks or dangers. Hydrographic Notices and Supplements referring to each volume are published from time to time. Supplements contain all the information received up to date since the publication of the volume to which they refer, and cancel all previous Hydrographic Notices. Hydrographic Notices contain all information up to date since the publication of the volume, or since the last Supplement or Hydrographic Notice, but endeavour is made to issue no more than one of these affecting each volume, and, on the collection of fresh information, to include the former Notice in a Supplement. The existence of Supplements or Hydrographic Notices is to be noted, in the tabulated form placed for the purpose inside the cover of each volume, in cases when such notations have not been made before issue, and also on receipt of further Notices after commission."], [15, "GENERAL NAVIGATION. IX Notes should be made in the margin of the volume of sailing directions affected, as references to the Supplements or Hydrographic Notices when the latter are printed on both sides. To enable the books to be more conveniently corrected, however, such Supplements and Hydrographic Notices as are of moderate size are now being printed on one side only, and two copies are issued to each ship ; one to cut up, the slips being pasted in at the appro priate place ; the other to retain intact for reference. To make these notations or paste in these slips is one of the early duties of a navigating officer after drawing his box of charts and books, and similar notes are to be made from Notices to Mariners that may thereafter be received. It must, however, be thoroughly understood that sailing directions will never be correct in all details, except up to the date of the last Hydrographic Notice or Supplement, and that, as already stated, when differences exist, the chart, which should be corrected from the most recent information, should be taken as the guide ; for which purpose, for ordinary navigation, they are sufficient. THE USE OF CHARTS AS NAVIGATIONAL AIDS, AND GENERAL REMARKS RELATING TO PRACTICAL NAVIGATION. 1. Accuracy of 'a Chart. \u2014 The value of a chart must manifestly depend upon the accuracy of the survey on which it is based, and this becomes more important the larger is the scale of the chart. To estimate this, the date of the survey, which is always given in the title, is a good guide. Besides the changes that, in waters where sand or mud prevails, may have taken place since the date of the survey, the earlier surveys were mostly made under circumstances that precluded great accuracy of detail, and until a plan founded on such a survey is tested, it should be regarded with caution. It may, indeed, be said that, except in well- frequented harbours and their approaches, no surveys yet made have been so minute in their exami nation of the bottom as to make it certain that all dangers have been found. The fulness or scantiness of the soundings is another method of estimating the completeness of a chart. When the soundings are sparse or unevenly distributed, it may be taken for granted that the survey was not in great detail."], [16, "X GENERAL NAVIGATION. Blank spaces*among soundings mean that no soundings have been obtained in these spots. When the surrounding soundings are deep it may with fairness be assumed that in the blanks the water is also deep ; but when they are shallow, or it can be seen from the rest of the chart that reefs or banks are present, such blanks should be regarded with suspicion. This is especially the case in coral regions and off rocky coasts, and it should be remembered that in waters where rocks abound it is always possible that a survey, however complete and detailed, may have failed to find every small patch. A wide berth should therefore be given to every rocky shore or patch, and this rule should be invariably followed, viz., that instead of considering- a coast to be clear unless it is shown to be foul, the contrary should be assumed. 2. Fathom Lines 'a Caution. \u2014 Except in plans of harbours that have been surveyed in detail, the five-fathom line on most Admiralty charts is to be considered as a caution or danger line against unnecessarily approaching the shore or bank within that line, on account of the possibility of the existence of undiscovered inequalities of the bottom, which nothing but an \"elaborate detailed survey could reveal. In general surveys of coasts or of little frequented anchor ages, the necessities of navigation do not demand the great expendi ture of time required for such a detailed survey. It is not contem plated that ships will approach the shores in such localities without taking special precautions. . The ten-fathom line is, on rocky shores, another warning, especially for ships of heavy draught. Charts where no fathom lines are marked must be especially regarded with caution, as it generally means that soundings were too scanty and the bottom too uneven to enable them to be drawn with accuracy. Isolated soundings, shoaler than surrounding depths, should always be avoided, especially if ringed round, as there is no knowing how closely the spot may have been examined. 3. Chart on largest scale always to be used. \u2014 It sometimes happens that, from press of work, only the copper plate of the larger scale chart of a particular locality can at once receive any extensive"], [17, "GENERAL NAVIGATION. XI re-arrangement of coastline or soundings. This is an additional reason, besides the obvious one of the greater detail shown on a larger scale chart, why this largest scale chart should always be used for navigating. 4. Caution in using small Scale Charts. \u2014 In approaching the land or dangerous banks, regard must always be had to the scale of the chart used. A small error in laying down a position means only yards on a large scale chart, whereas on a small scale the same amount of displacement means large fractions of a mile. This is particularly to be observed when coming to an anchor on a narrow ledge of convenient depth at some distance from the shore. For the same reason bearings to objects near should be used in preference to objects farther off, although the latter may be more prominent, as a small error in bearing or in laying it down on the chart has a greater effect in misplacing the position the longer the line to be drawn. 5. Distortion of Printed Charts. \u2014 The paper on which charts are printed has to be damped. On drying distortion takes place, from the inequalities in the paper, which greatly varies with different paper and the amount of the original damping ; but it does not affect navigation. It must not, however, be expected that accurate series of angles taken to different points will always exactly agree, when carefully plotted upon the chart, especially if the lines to objects be long. The larger the chart the greater the amount of this distortion. 6. Buoys. \u2014 It is manifestly impossible that any reliance can be placed on buoys always maintaining their exact position. Buoys should therefore be regarded as warnings and not as infallible navigating marks, especially when in exposed positions ; and a ship should always, when possible, be navigated by bearings or angles of fixed objects on shore and not by buoys. 7. Lights. \u2014 Circles drawn on charts round a light are not intended to give information as to the distance at which it can be seen, but solely indicate, in the case of lights which do not show equally in all directions, the bearings between which the variation, or visibility, or obscuration of the light occurs. All the distances given in the Light Lists and om the charts for the visibility of lights are calculated for a height of an observer's eye of 15 feet. The table of distances visible due to height at"], [18, "XII GENERAL NAVIGATION. end of each Light List, affords a means of ascertaining how much more or less the light is visible should the height of the bridge be more or less. The glare of a powerful light is often seen far beyond the limit of visibility of the actual rays of the light, but this must not be confounded with the true range. Again, refraction may often cause a light to be seen farther than under ordinary circumstances. When looking out for a light at night, the fact is often forgotten that from aloft the range of vision is much increased. By noting a star immediately over the light a very correct bearing may be after wards obtained from the standard compass. The intrinsic power of a light should always be considered when expecting to make it in thick weather. A weak light is easily obscured by haze, and no dependence can be placed on its being seen. The power of a light can be estimated by remarking its order, as given in the Light Lists, and in some cases by noting how much its visibility in clear weather falls short of the range due to the height at which it is placed. Thus, a light standing 200 feet above\" the sea and only recorded as visible at 10 miles in clear weather, is manifestly of little brilliancy, as its height would permit it to be seen over 20 miles if of any power. (See table in Light List above mentioned.) 8. Fog Signals. \u2014 Sound is conveyed in a very capricious way through the atmosphere. Apart from wind, large areas of silence have been found in different directions and at different distances from the origin of a sound, even in clear weather. Therefore too much confidence should not be felt in hearing a fog signal. The apparatus, moreover, for sounding the signal often requires some time before it is in readiness to act. A fog often creeps imperceptibly towards the land, and is not observed by the people at a lighthouse until it is upon them ; whereas a ship may have been for many hours in it, and approaching the land. In such a case no signal may be sounded. When sound has to travel against the wind, it may be thrown upwards ; in such a case, a man aloft might hear it when it is inaudible on deck. Taken together, these facts should induce the utmost caution in closing the land in fogs. The lead is generally the only safe guide. 9. Tides and Tidal Streams. \u2014 In navigating coasts where the tidal range is considerable, caution is always necessary. It should be remembered that there are indraughts to all bays and bights, although the general run of the stream may be parallel to the shore."], [19, "GENERAL NAVIGATION. XIII The turn of the tidal stream off shore is seldom coincident with the time of high and low water on the shore. In open channels, the tidal stream ordinarily overruns the turn of the vertical movement of the tide by three hours, forming what is usually known as tide and half-tide, the effect of which is that at high and low water by the shore the stream is running at its greatest velocity. In crossing a bar or shallow flats, the table (B) at page 98 of the Tide Tables will be found of great assistance in calculating how much the water has risen or fallen at any hour of the tide. On coasts where there is much diurnal inequality in the tides, the amount of rise and fall can never be depended upon, and additional caution is necessary. It should also be remembered that at times the tide falls below the level of low water, ordinary springs. This always occurs in temperate regions at the equinoxes, but wind may produce it at any time, and the amount varies with locality. When the moon's perigee coincides with the' full or new moon the same effect is often produced. 10. Current Arrows on charts only showthe most usual or the mean direction of a tidal stream or current. It must never be assumed that the direction of a stream will not vary from that indicated by the arrow. In the same manner, the rate of a stream constantly varies with circumstances, and the rate given on the chart is merely the mean of those found during the survey, possibly from very few observations. 11. Fixing Position. \u2014 The most accurate method of fixing a position relative to the shore is by angles between well-defined objects on the chart. All ships are now being supplied with a station pointer, and this method should be used whenever possible. Two things are, however, necessary to its successful employment. First, that the objects be well chosen j and second, that the observer is skilful and rapid in his use of the sextant. For the former, reference can be had to the pamphlet on the use of the station pointer, which is in every chart box. The latter is only to be obtained by practice. It will readily be seen that in war time, when the compass may be knocked away, or rifle-fire may make it undesirable to expose the person more than necessary, a sextant offers great advantages, as"], [20, "XIV GENERAL NAVIGATION. angles can be obtained from any position whence the objects are visible. It is this contingency that makes it especially desirable that all navigating officers should become expert in this method of fixing a ship's position. In many narrow waters also, where the objects may yet be at some distance, as in coral harbours or narrow passages among mud banks, navigation by sextant and station-pointer is invaluable, as a true position can only be obtained by its means. A small error in either taking or plotting a bearing under such circumstances may put the ship ashore. It is not intended that the use of the compass to fix the ship should be given up ; there are many circumstances in which it may be usefully employed, but errors more readily creep into a position so fixed. In all cases where great accuracy of position is desired, angles should invariably be used, such as the fixing of a rock or shoal, or of additions to a chart, as fresh soundings or new buildings. In all such cases angles should be taken to several objects, the more the better ; but five objects is a good number, as the four angles thus obtained not only prevent any errors, but they at once furnish a means of checking the accuracy of the chart itself. In the case of ordinary soundings, it is only necessary to take a third angle now and then ; firstly, to check the general accuracy of the chart as above stated ; secondly, to make certain that the more important soundings, as at the end of a line, are correctly placed. Sometimes, when only two objects are visible, a compass bearing and sextant angle may be used with advantage. In passing near a point of land, or an island, the method of fixing by doubling the angle on the bow is invaluable. The ordinary form of it, the so-called \"four-point bearing,\" when the bearing is taken four points on the bow, and on the beam, the distance from the object at the latter position being the distance run between the times of taking the two bearings, gives an excellent fix for a departure, but does not ensure safety, as the point, and probably the rocks off it, are abeam before the position is obtained. By taking the bearings of two points and four points on the bow a very good position is obtained before the object is passed ; the distance of the latter at the second position being, as before, equal to the distance run in the interval, allowing for current,"], [21, "GENERAL NAVIGATION. XV A table of factors, by which to multiply the distance run, to obtain the distance of the object when any number of degrees between the two bearings has been observed, is now supplied in all chart boxes. The use of a danger angle in passing outlying rocks with land behind should also not be forgotten. In employing this method, however, caution is necessary, as should the chart be not accurate, i.e., should the objects selected be not quite correctly placed, the angle taken off from it may not serve the purpose. It should not, therefore, be employed when the survey is old or manifestly imperfect. In fixing by the compass, it must always be remembered that two bearings only are liable to error. An absolute error may be made in either bearing observed ; errors may be made in applying the deviation ; or errors may creep in in laying them on to the chart. For these reasons a third or check, bearing of some other object should be taken, especially when ne,ar the shore or dangers. The coincidence of these three lines will prevent any mistakes. In ships still fitted with the Admiralty standard compass, the tripod supplied to hold the lamp will be found of great service in fixing position at night, as by its aid a bearing can be as accurately taken as in daylight. With Thomson's compass bearings can also be accurately observed at night. The utility of this in connection with ascertaining the change of bearing of an approaching ship's light should not be forgotten. Amongst astronomical methods of fixing a ship's position, attention is drawn to the great utility of Sumner's method. A Sumner line,. that is, a line drawn through the position (obtained by an assumed latitude and longitude by chronometer) at right angles to the bearing of the sun, as obtained from the azimuth tables, gives at times invaluable information, as the ship must be somewhere on that line provided the chronometer is correct. A deep cast at the same time may often serve to get an approximate position on the line. An early and very accurate position can be also obtained by Sumner's. method, by getting longitude by a bright star at daylight when the horizon is well visible, and another longitude by the sun when a few degrees above the horizon, or by observing two or more stars at twilight. The Sumner lines drawn through the two positions thus, SO 11886c a 3"], [22, "XVI GENERAL NAVIGATION. obtained will, if the bearing of sun and star differ three points or more, give an excellent result. 12. Change of Variation of the Compass. \u2014 The gradual change in the variation must not be forgotten in laying down positions by bear ing on charts. The magnetic compasses placed on the charts for the purpose of facilitating plotting become in time slightly in error, and in some cases, such as with small scales, or when the lines are long, the displacement of position from neglect of this change may be of importance. The compasses are re-engraved when the error amounts to a quarter of a point, but the chart plates cannot be corrected more frequently from the impossibility of making alterations too often on \u25a0one spot in a copper plate. The geographical change in the variation is in some parts of the world sufficiently rapid to need consideration. For instance, in approaching Halifax from Newfoundland the variation changes 10\u00b0 in less than 500 miles. The variation chart should be consulted on this head. 13. Local Magnetic Disturbance of the Compass on board Ship. \u2014 The term \" local magnetic disturbance \" has reference only to the effects on the compass of magnetic masses external to the ship in which it is placed. Observation shows that disturbance of the compass in a ship afloat is experienced only in a few places on the globe. Magnetic laws do not permit of the supposition that it is the visible land which causes such disturbance, because the effect of a magnetic force diminishes in such rapid proportion as the distance from it increases, that it would require a local centre of magnetic force of an amount absolutely unknown to affect a compass half a mile distant. Such deflections of the compass are due to magnetic minerals in the bed of the sea under the ship, and when the water is shallow and the force strong, the compass may be temporarily deflected when passing over such a spot, but the area of disturbance will be small unless there are many centres near together. The law which has hitherto been found to hold good as regards local magnetic disturbance is, that north of the magnetic equator the north end of the compass needle is attracted towards any centre of disturbance ; south of the magnetic equator it is repelled."], [23, "GENERAL NAVIGATION. XVII It is very desirable that whenever a ship passes over an area of local magnetic disturbance, the position should be fixed, and the facts reported as far as they can be ascertained. 14. Use of Oil for Modifying the Effect of Breaking Waves. \u2014 Many experiences of late years have shown that the utility of oil for this purpose is undoubted, and the application simple. The following may serve for the guidance of seamen, whose attention is called to the fact that a very small quantity of oil, skilfully applied, may prevent much damage both to ships (especially the smaller classes) and to boats, by modifying the action of breaking seas. The principal facts as to the use of oil are as follows : \u2014 1. On free waves, i.e., waves in deep water, the effect is greatest. 2. In a surf, or waves breaking on a bar, where a mass of liquid is in actual motion in shallow water, the effect of the oil is uncertain ; as nothing can prevent the larger waves from breaking under such circumstances ; but even here it is of some service. 3. The heaviest and thickest oils are most effectual. Refined kerosene is of little use ; crude petroleum is serviceable when nothing else is obtainable'; but all animal and vegetable oils, such as waste oil from the engines, have great effect. 4. A small quantity of oil suffices, if applied in such a manner as to spread to windward. 5. It is useful in a ship or boat, both when running, or lying to, or in wearing. 6. No experiences are related of its use when hoisting a boat up in a sea-way at sea, but it is highly probable that much time and injury to the boat would be saved by its application on such occasions. 7. In cold water, the oil, being thickened by the lower temperature, and not being able to spread freely, will have its effect much reduced. This will vary with the description of oil used. 8. The best method of application in a ship at sea appears to be : hanging over the side, in such a manner as to be in the water, small canvas bags, capable of holding from one to two gallons of oil, such bags being pricked with a sail needle to facilitate leakage of the oil."], [24, "XVIII GENERAL NAVIGATION. The position of these bags should vary with the circumstances. Running before the wind they should be hung on either bow \u2014 e.g., from the cathead \u2014 and allowed to tow in the water. With the wind on the quarter the effect seems to be less than in any other position, as the oil goes astern while the waves come up on the quarter. Lying to, the weather bow and another position farther aft seem the best places from which to hang the bags, with a sufficient length of line to permit them to draw to windward, while the ship drifts. 9. Crossing a bar with a flood tide, oil poured overboard and allowed to float in ahead of the boat which would follow with a bag towing astern, would appear to be the best plan. As before remarked, under these circumstances the effect cannot be so much trusted. On a bar with the ebb tide it would seem to be useless to try oil for the purpose of entering. 10. For boarding a wreck, it is recommended to pour oil overboard to windward of her before going alongside. The effect in this case must greatly depend upon the set of the current, and the circum stances of the depth of water. 11. For a boat riding in bad weather from a sea anchor, it is recommended to fasten the bag to an endless line rove through a block on the sea anchor, by which means the oil is diffused well ahead of the boat, and the bag can be readily hauled on board for refilling if necessary."], [25, ""], [26, ""], [27, "For latest information respecting the lights described in this volume, the mariner is referred to the Admiralty- List of Lights, Parts II. and IV.

To this must be added the caution that the wind has considerable effect on the strength and direction of the tidal streams, as well as on the range of the tides ; and that winds from between N. Wand N.E., which are the smooth-water winds on the English coast, are those which produce the heaviest seas on the French shores. * See Admiralty chart.

It is the more necessary to bear these facts in mind, as the nature of the French coast differs so materially from the English side of the Channel, it being almost everywhere lined with rocks and dangerous shoals, extending in some places many miles from the shore, and without a single good natural harbour or easily-approached secure roadstead from one end to the other ; added to which, the tides have double the range of those on the English shore, and the tidal streams are much stronger and more variable in direction ; see pages 5 \u2014 9. It is desirable that the seaman should have a knowledge of the various signals used at French ports, such as the weather signals, made in addition to storm warnings ; also, of those for indicating the depth of water at the entrance of ports, and of the uniform system of buoyage adopted by the French Government ; the rules and regulations on these and other subjects, as well as a list of the places at which the assistance or advice of a British Consular Officer may be obtained, are therefore given before proceeding to the description of Ushant in Chapter II. WINDS. \u2014 The prevailing winds in the Channel are westerly, and they greatly preponderate over easterly winds. From October to March inclusive, westerly gales are most frequent, often lasting three or four days ; during May, June, and July, they are comparatively rare. South-westerly gales are very dangerous in the eastern part of the Channel, are generally accompanied by rain, and the wind, blowing in violent gusts, sometimes, without losing strength, veers suddenly to N.W., North, or even to N.E., causing a heavy sea on the French coast southward of Cape Grisnez. Should the wind continue from the northward with a rising barometer, its force usually moderates and the weather becomes fine ; but, should it back to the S.W. with a falling barometer, bad weather is sure to return. It has been remarked that gales which occur during spring tides are generally more violent and lasting than those which take place during neaps, and that they acquire their greatest strength at the beginning of the flood. Winds from North to N.E. are sometimes strong at both entrances to the Channel, but seldom acquire the force of a gale in its central portion except on the French shore ; they do not usually last so long nor does the wind shift as with those from the westward. They cause a heavy sea on the flood stream, and, during their continuance, the land is generally covered with a white fog resembling smoke, an appearance common during all easterly winds which sometimes, when sf moderate force, blow with great persistence.

I.] WINDS. \u2014 CALMS. \u2014 SNOW. 3 South-easterly winds, accompanied by rain and a falling barometer, almost always become gales ; these are off-shore and therefore smooth-water winds on the French coast, but their continuance from that quarter seldom lasts long ; for, gales in the Channel being mostly of a cyclonic character and travelling eastward, a change of wind is to be expected, and the direction of the change depends on whether the position of the vessel is northward or southward of the track of the centre of depression. If southward of it, the wind veers from S.E. to South, and West ; if northward, it backs to East and North. Seamen should bear in mind the well-known rule for ascertaining the position of a storm's centre, or, in other words, of the area of low barometric pressure round which the wind circu lates, when in the northern hemisphere, viz. \u2014 to face the wind, when this central depression will be from 8 to 12 points to the right of its direction. Careful attention to the barometer and to any changes in the direction of the wind give a sure clue to future probable changes. Moderate Winds from N.W. to N.E. bring fine weather. In the Channel, during summer, regular land and sea breezes frequently become established in fine settled weather ; at night, it then falls calm and a heavy dew ensues. When there is little or no dew, it is a sign of an impending change of weather. Calms are of rare occurrence, even in summer, and do not last long. In winter, they are generally precursors of bad weather, of which there are no more certain indications than swell in the offing and surf on the coast during a calm. Snow. \u2014 In some winters snow is abundant ; the wind is often fresh and baffling in snow squalls, and the falling snow effectually obscures all objects from view. After a snow shower, there is often great difficulty in recognising the land which may be in sight, the snow completely altering its aspect. A change from rain to hail often accompanies or precedes sudden changes in the wind from a southerly to a more northerly direction. The peculiar configuration of the land, as well as the great rise and fall of tide in the Gulf of St. Malo, appears to influence to a certain degree the winds and weather in that neighbourhood and amongst the Channel Islands ; remarks on these local winds will be found at page 221. See chart, No. 1,598. A. 2 SO 11886"], [32, "4 [Chap. I. GENERAL INFORMATION. Fogs. \u2014 Fogs are frequent in all parts of the Channel, and may occur at any time of the year ; they are, however, most frequent under anti-cyclonic conditions, i.e., with a high barometer. In summer they generally hide the land in the morning only and dis perse as the sun acquires strength. The moist haze accompanying westerly winds is more tenacious and only yields to a freshening breeze ; it then frequently turns to rain and marks the commence ment of bad weather. In the eastern part of the Channel it is rare for the land to be entirely free from mist except previously to strong north-easterly winds, when it may be distinctly seen from a great distance. Westerly winds, as before remarked, frequently bring mist, rain, and low dense clouds, which conceal the land from view. With easterly winds, the haze which covers the land is dense in proportion as the wind is strong and lasting. Mirage is most frequent on the French coast, especially in the bight between Cape Barfleur and Cape d'Antifer ; it is considered an indication of fine weather if it tends only to enlarge the apparent size of objects ; but, when it distorts and renders them difficult of recognition, it is usually followed by rain or by strong easterly winds. When mirage is prevalent about sunset, it may be expected that as night draws on the Channel lights will become visible at much greater distances than under ordinary circumstances. SOUNDINGS.\u2014 Tidal datum.\u2014 The soundings on French charts of the coast of France are reduced to the level of the lowest tide known, or, lower even than mean equinoctial springs. The Admiralty charts for the French coast are founded on the French, and adopt the same datum, termed by the French the zero of soundings. The tidal rise is given from that datum ; the spring rise is therefore greater than the spring range, and not the same as is the case in Admiralty charts in general ; it follows that the depths at low water, ordinary springs, are always greater than those shown on the chart. As regards the Channel Islands, chart No. 62, Jersey, a, b and c, follows the French system ; whilst No. 262, a, b and c, Guernsey, Herm, and Serk, follow the usual Admiralty method. The mariner should always consult the statement as to the datum of soundings on every chart, when no error can be possible. The French tides are calculated from a quantity called \"l'Unite de Hauteur,\" which is the half range of the tide at mean equinoctial See chart, No. 1,598."], [33, "Chap. I.] FOGS. \u2014 SOUNDINGS. \u2014 TIDES 5 springs. No allusion to this is, however, made on the Admiralty charts. Edge Of soundings.\u2014 For all practical purposes the 100-fathoms line may be considered as the edge of soundings, as beyond that depth in the entrance of the channel, the increase of depth is very rapid, and bottom is very rarely obtained in the ordinary course of navigation. The 100-fathoms line is between 80 and 90 miles distant south-westward of Ushant, and it borders the western coast of France from thence to the southward at the distance of about 90 miles. The edge of soundings may generally be recognized in fine weather by the numerous ripplings in its vicinity, and in boisterous weather by the sudden alteration in the colour of the water from dark blue to a disturbed green. TIDES. \u2014 The tides on the continental shore of the English channel are somewhat different to those on the island side, as the undulation travels with greater regularity and is of much greater height ; but they possess certain points of similarity, in that there are two positions where tidal range is at a maximum, with another between with low range, and the minimum on the French coast is situated opposite that on the English coast (viz., at Omonville, opposite St. Alban's head) though the spring range at the former, 15 feet, is about three times the range of the latter. Eastward of the position of minimum range, there is on both coasts a water stand at high water ; of about 2 hours at Southampton on the English side, and of nearly 3 hours at Havre on the French side. The range, at springs, on the French coast reaches nearly 40 feet in the gulf of St. Malo, and 28^ feet at Cayeux at the entrance of the Somme, and the time occupied by the rising tide is 5\u00a3 hours, and by the falling tide 1\\ hours. It has not yet been accurately ascertained what proportion the range of the tides in the fairway of the Channel bears to the range on the nearest coasts. It is probably somewhat less, but it will be in all cases safe to allow a range corresponding to the range on the coast when reducing the soundings actually obtained by a ship, in order to compare them with the soundings shown on the chart. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 The general subject of Channel tidal streams is fully considered in Channel Pilot, part I., page 5, but the streams being so much stronger and more variable on the French coast than on the English, a few further observations, and even some repcution, may not be out of place here. See chart, No. 1,598."], [34, "6 GENERAL INFORMATION. [Chap. I. There is, generally, on the French, as on other coasts, an indraught into all bays and bights ; notably, so into those of St. Malo, the Seine, and the Somme, and the streams as a rule turn from one to two hours earlier inshore than at a few miles in the offing. Full descriptions of all inshore and local streams will be found accom panying the descriptions of the various localities. See \" Tidal streams \" in the index. A general knowledge of the streams is most easily acquired when they are described within certain defined limits and under well known names, as the Channel stream, the North sea stream, the Intermediate stream, &c. ; thus, the Channel stream occupies the area between the western end of Dover strait and a line drawn between the Start and Casquets ; the southern North sea stream, that between the eastern end of Dover strait and a line drawn between the estuary of the Lynn and the Texel ; and Dover strait, for tidal purposes, may be defined as the space contained between a line drawn from Beachy head to point d'Ailly or the river Somme on the western side, and from the North Foreland to Dunkerque on the eastern side. The Channel and North sea streams run in opposite directions at the same time, both setting towards Dover strait whilst the water is rising at Dover, and away from it whilst the water is falling at Dover. These streams also run in opposite directions to the streams outside them, as presently explained, and at these outer meetings and separations they are ever varying in direction, according as the strength of the one prevails over the other, producing a rotatory motion with scarcely any interval of slack water. It has been stated that the Channel and North sea streams meet and separate in Dover strait. Within the limit of that strait, as defined, the stream although first running with the Channel stream and then with the North sea stream, does not slack with those streams but remains running both at high and low water at Dover, at which times the Channel and North sea streams are at rest ; the stream in Dover strait is, therefore, known as the Intermediate stream. The place of meeting and separation of the Channel and North sea streams in Dover strait is not stationary, but moves from West to East between the two lines of demarcation, both on the rising and falling tide, thus : \u2014 When the water at Dover begins to fall, the Channel and North sea ebb streams have both made, and the line of separation is off Beachy head at the western limit. As the fall continues this line creeps eastward : at 2 hours after high water it is off Hastings ; by the fifth hour it is near the South Foreland ; and by low water, it has reached See chart, No. 1,598."], [35, "Chap. I.] TIDAL STREAMS. 7 the eastern limit, the line from the North Foreland to Dunkerque. At this time, the Channel and North sea ebb streams, westward and eastward of Dover strait, have ceased running, and it is slack water in their respective areas, but the Intermediate stream is still running westward. When the water at Dover begins to rise, the Channel and North sea flood streams have both made, and set towards Dover strait. The North sea stream consequently runs with the Intermediate stream, whilst the Channel stream meets it, and this opposition continues so long as the tide is rising at Dover. The point of meeting, like that of separation, is at first at the western limit, off Beachy head ; it occurs at the time of low water at Dover and gradually shifts east ward as the tide rises. The point of meeting 4 hours before high water is nearly the same as the point of separation 2 hours after high Avater, and so this point of junction moves eastward until, about the time of high water at Dover, it has reached the eastern limit, between the North Foreland and Dunkerque. The Channel and North sea flood streams have then both ceased running, but the Intermediate stream in Dover strait is still running eastward. Within the next hour, the Channel and North sea ebb streams have both made, so that now the Intermediate stream falls in with the North sea stream and runs with it, whilst it separates from the Channel stream, the separation as before commencing off Beachy head and moving eastward. Off the mouth of the Channel westward of Scilly, and northward and westward of Ushant, the stream is constantly changing in direction, the general tendency being northward and eastward whilst the tide is falling at Dover, southward and westward whilst it is rising at that port. The changes in direction of stream in this wide area, in one tide of 12 \\ hours, make one complete circuit of the compass ; thus, when it is low water at Dover, the stream in this area is running eastward ; during the rising tide at Dover it changes to south-eastward, southward, and south-westward ; and at high water at Dover it is running westward. With the falling tide at Dover the stream changes to north-westward, northward, and north eastward, until, by low water at Dover, its direction is again eastward. The maximum rate of these outer streams is 1^ knots, but that rate is very rarely reached, the usual rate being from one knot or less, at springs, to a quarter or half a knot at neaps, and there is a slight excess of north-eastern stream over that to the south-westward. In the space contained between a line drawn from Ushant to Land's End and another from the Casquets to the Start, there is, as See chart, No. 1,598."], [36, "8 GENERAL INFORMATION. [Chap. I. before mentioned, a mixed stream partaking of the joint directions of the Channel and outer streams. Eastward of the latter line the stream follows the fairway of the Channel and carries a vessel towards Dover strait whilst the tide is rising at Dover, and away from it whilst it is falling there. The tidal streams in the gulf of St. Malo require special care. With the falling tide at Dover, the stream sets sharply into this gulf on both sides of the Channel islands, and the prevalence of westerly winds is said to increase its strength. With the rising tide at Dover it sets across and out of the gulf, the north-eastern part of the stream sweeping through the Russell and other channels on either side of Guernsey towards and through the Race of Alderney at from 7 to 8 knots. See pages 224, 298, 305, 366, and 386 With the rising tide at Dover, the stream sets sharply round cape Barfleur into the Baie de la Seine, curving more and more until it finally takes the sweep of the shore, but leaving the western part of the bay partly in eddy, and the stream slacks in all that part nearly an hour before high water at Dover, whilst in the eastern part it runs about half an hour beyond the time of high water at Dover, so that when eastward of Havre a ship beating up Channel may prolong the tide in her favour by standing close over towards the French shore. Between Dieppe and cape Grisnez, during the rising tide, great attention should be paid to the direction of the streams, as hereabouts they meet and are turned down towards the French shore ; there fore, a ship which on the English side would at this time have a stream setting her straight up Channel, here encounters one on her beam sweeping her down towards the entrance of the Somme, and this is doubtless the cause of many of the wrecks which take place on this part of the French coast. As regards the maximum rate of the streams on the French coast, at springs, though these will be found in detail in the local descrip tions, it may be stated roughly that in the immediate neighbourhood of Ushant, and in the channels between it and the land, the stream runs in places as much as 6 or 7 knots ; along the coast eastward and along the shores of the gulf of St. Malo, 3 to 4^ knots, but as much as 5 knots immediately off headlands ; 3 to 4 knots generally among the Channel islands ; 4 knots through the Deroute channel, and 5 knots through the Russell channels and also between Jersey and the Minquiers rocks. Through the Swinge and in the Race of Alderney 7 to 8 knots is the ordinary rate. Between cape de la Hague and cape Barfleur, 3 t\" 4 knots, but as much as 6 knots See chart, No. 1,598."], [37, "Chap. I.] TIDAL STREAMS \u2014 CAUTION. \u2014 BAROMETER. 9 immediately off both capes ; 2% to 3 knots in the Baie de la Seine, with a very dangerous indraught towards the whole estuary of the river Seine, on the flood, when in its vicinity. From cape d'Antifer to cape Grisnez it varies from 3 to 4 knots, but fully 4 knots when near the latter cape. From cape Grisnez eastward to and beyond Dunkerque, the rate is from 4^ to 3 knots. It will thus be seen that the strength of the streams generally on the French coast is nearly or quite double that experienced on the English side of the Channel. CAUTION\u2014 APPROACH TO USHANT ISLAND Ushant island being the limit of this work, the remarks on its approach belong more particularly to the sailing directions for the west coasts of France, Spain and Portugal, in which they already appear ; but the importance of the subject makes it desirable to include them in this work also, and they will be found at page 18. Variation Of the Compass.\u2014 The amount of variation for the year 1897 at the principal ports and headlands of the French coast and Channel Islands will be found at the head of each chapter. The general direction of the lines of equal variation is S.S.W. and N. N.E. (true). Strict attention should be paid to the correction of course required by the continuous change in variation when proceeding up or down Channel, especially if steaming or sailing at a high speed. The difference in variation between Ushant and Dunkerque is 3\u00b0, the variation decreasing as a vessel proceeds eastward. The annual decrease of variation at present is about 7'. BAROMETER. \u2014 The average range of the barometer in the higher latitudes, i.e. 50\u00b0 to 60c, is about 1*5 inches, but, on extra ordinary occasions, ranges of 2-75 and 3 inches have been recorded. In the northern hemisphere the effect of the veering of the wind on the barometer is according to the following law : \u2014 With East, S.E., and South winds, the barometer falls. \u201e S.W. winds, the barometer ceases to fall and begins to rise. \u201e West, N.W., and North winds, the barometer rises. \u201e N.E. winds, the barometer ceases to rise and begins to fall. By the knowledge of the barometric pressure at a number of places 100 or 200 miles apart, we may know with considerable certainty a few hours in advance, from which direction the wind may be expected to blow at any place, according to the law discovered by, and bearing the name of, Professor Buys Ballots The rule is, \" Stand with your right hand towards the place where the barometric reading is lowest and your left hand towards where it is highest ; See chart, No. 1,598."], [38, "10 [Chap. I. GENERAL INFORMATION. you will then be facing the direction from which the wind may be expected to blow.\" This rule applies to the northern hemisphere but must be reversed in southern latitudes. Thermometer \u2014 The thermometer in the northern hemisphere rises with East, S.E., and South winds. With a S.W. wind it ceases to rise and begins to fall. It falls with West, N.W., and North winds, with N.E. winds it ceases to fall and begins to rise. PORT REGULATIONS, &C\u2014 All French ports of importance are subject to Port regulations which are strictly enforced, and to which ready attention and obedience should be shown. In some cases, anchorage is temporarily forbidden within certain areas, and notices published to that effect ; in others it may be permanently prohibited. The only such cases at present, on the North coast of France, are at Cherbourg and Havre, of which the limits will be found described at pages 408 and 496; but those intending to visit French ports would do well to ascertain beforehand what late Notices to Mariners may have been issued on the subject of prohibited anchorages, as well as to make themselves generally acquainted with the French systems of signals, beaconage, buoyage, &c. FRENCH STORM SIGNALS\u2014 These signals resemble those formerly in use on the English coasts where, however, the cone only is now used ; they are made at the harbours and Semaphore stations on the coast of France, and remain hoisted 48 hours from the time of receiving notice from the Ministry of Marine. The signals are made with a cone and drum painted black, which, when hoisted, appear as a triangle and square, thus : \u2014 i Southerly gale. \u2014 The cone point downwards means that Y strong winds are probable, at first from the southward (from ' S.E. round by South to N.W.). i Northerly gale. \u2014 The cone point upwards means that A strong winds are probable, first from the northward (from N.W. ' round by North to N.E.). I i Very heavy gales \u2014 The drum is hoisted with the I fa cone whenever a very heavy gale, southerly or northerly as v^ 1 1 the case may be, is probable, (with southerly gales above the ' ' cone, with northerly gales below the cone). The drum is not used without the cone. Sudden Sh'ifts Of Wind. \u2014 No signal is employed to indicate a wind which is likely to shift suddenly, but it must be remembered that a southerly wind is much more likely to veer to a point north- See chart, No. 1,598."], [39, "Chap. I.] 11 PORT REGULATIONS. \u2014 SIGNALS. ward of West, than a northerly wind is to veer to a point southward of East. Consequently, when the South cone is hoisted and a vessel is at an anchorage open to the N.W. it is well to be prepared for the gale being finally from that quarter. Meaning Of signals. \u2014 The hoisting of any of these signals is intended as a sign that there is an atmospherical disturbance in existence which will probably cause a gale from the quarter indicated by the signal used, in the neighbourhood, say within a distance of 50 miles, of the place where the signal is hoisted, and the knowledge of which is likely to be of use to the sailors and fishermen on that part of the coast. Its meaning is simply \" look out ! It is probable that bad weather of such and such a character is approaching you.\" WEATHER SIGNALS.\u2014 The following weather signals, in addition to the established storm warnings, have been adopted at the Semaphore stations and at the principal ports and shipping places on the coasts of France : \u2014 1. A flag, of any colour, indicates \u2014 Weather doubtful, barometer in- clined to fall. 2. A short pendant (Cornet) \u201e Appearance of bad weather, heavy sea, barometer falling. 3. A pendant Appearance of better weather, barometer rising. n 4. A flag above Cornet \u201e The entrance of the port has become dangerous. 5. A flag below Cornet \u201e The life-boat is coming out, Note. \u2014 In fine settled weather no signal is made. FOG SIGNALS. \u2014 On the coast of France, fog signals are made either by sirens, trumpets, or bells. Light-vessels generally use the latter. At stations on shore it is not always possible to de termine the existence of fog banks in the offing ; and, where the signal is dependent upon steam, nearly an hour may elapse from the time it is judged necessary to use the fog signal until the signal can be made. Large areas of silence may also be expected to exist during fogs in different directions and at different distances from a fog signal station, as it is known that such is the case even in fine weather ; and, sometimes a man aloft can hear the signal distinctly when it is inaudible from the deck. Mariners are therefore cautioned that, when approaching the land in a fog, they should not rely implicitly on hearing fog signals, but should always use the lead, which in nearly all cases gives sufficient warning to avert danger. See ohart, No. 1,698."], [40, "12 [Chap. I. GENERAL INFORMATION. SEMAPHORES. \u2014 Semaphore stations are very generally es tablished on the principal points and headlands of France. They are connected with the general telegraphic system, and vessels of all nations can communicate by the International Code either with their respective naval authorities or with commercial houses, their messages being forwarded by electric telegraph. Communications can also be made by the Semaphore signals in use in the French Navy. FRENCH TIDE SIGNALS.\u2014 The following system of tide signals was issued in August 1855 by the French Minister of Commerce and Public Works, and is now, with the variations mentioned, used at all the ports on the coast of France. The signals are made by balls and flags hoisted on a mast, on which a yard is crossed. The balls are black. A ball hoisted at the intersection of the mast and yard denotes a least depth of 10 feet (English) throughout the channel of the harbour. Each ball hoisted on the mast beneath the first denotes an additional depth of 3J feet. Each ball hoisted above the first denotes on additional depth of 65 feet. Each ball hoisted at the left yard-arm, looking from seaward, denotes an additional 10 inches. Each ball hoisted at the right yard-arm denotes an additional 1 foot 8 inches. To indicate the state of the tide, a white flag with a black cross is used ; also, a black pendant. These are hoisted at the mast-head immediately there are 6| feet in the channel and lowered when the water has receded to the same level. During the flood, the pendant is above the flag ; at high water and during the top of the tide, the pendant is hauled down ; and, during the ebb, the pendant is hoisted below the flag. When the state of the sea is such as to prevent vessels entering the port, these signals are replaced by a red flag hoisted at the mast-head. It should be remarked that the signals are not necessarily complete at all ports, but, so far as they are used, their significations are always the same. Thus, at some places the depths are shown only at every 3-| feet, in which cases balls at the yard-arms are not required. At others, the depth of 6^ feet, together with the state of the tides, is indicated by the flag and pendant, a ball being hoisted below them when there are 10 feet. In this latter case the mast has no yard. See chart, No. 1,598."], [41, "Chap. I.] 13 SEMAPHORES. \u2014 SIGNALS. \u2014 PILOTAGE Table of Tidal Signals RISING TIDE. HIGH WATER. FALLING TIDE. Signals forbidding entrance to ports. \u2014 The following signals are made in the event of the entraace of a harbour being obstructed by a stranded vessel or by any other accident, viz. : \u2014 By day, the tidal signals are replaced by a red flag hoisted at the tide-signal mast-head. By night, the two lights marking the entrance both show red ; and and if there is only one harbour light, a second light is shown close to it, both showing red. PILOTAGE. \u2014 Pilotage is compulsory at all French ports on all vessels of any considerable tonnage, though the limit of tonnage requiring a pilot is not the same at all ports ; practically the limit is so low that it includes all but the smallest coasters. If a vessel enters or quits a port without a pilot, the pilotage fee has neverthe less to be paid. The first duly licensed pilot offering himself has to be received, and if for any reason a second pilot should be received and employed, both have to be paid. Should a local fisherman or boatman be hired in the absence of a pilot, the duty must at once be handed over on a licensed pilot presenting himself, and every facility must in all cases be given to pilots in boarding vessels. Ships or other craft in tow, when there are more than one, are each, as well as the vessel towing, required to take a pilot ; each vessel has to pay half the pilotage charge, and the charge is reckoned according to the tonnage or draught of the largest vessel. Set chart, No. 1,598."], [42, "14 [Chap. I. GENERAL INFORMATION. Pilot Signals. \u2014 Every French pilot vessel or boat is distinguished by having a black anchor 3\u00a3 feet in height painted on the mainsail, and also by having the initials of the port or district for which she is licensed painted in large letters on the bow and quarter. By night, when pilots are on board, a pilot vessel exhibits a ivhite light at the top, visible from all directions, and lowered at intervals of at least fifteen minutes. A vessel requiring a pilot should, by day, hoist a white flag with a blue border at the foremast head, or if not supplied with such a flag her national flag. By night, she should show a ivhite light above her bulwarks, eclipsed for fifteen seconds during each minute. This latter signal may also be accompanied by blue lights at intervals of fifteen minutes. FRENCH UNIFORM SYSTEM OF BUOYAGE.\u2014 The following uniform system of buoyage is established on the French coast. It came into force 1st September 1890, annulling all previous regulations. It includes all marks, fixed or floating, which, by day, serve to indicate either existing dangers or the limits of navigable channels, such as buoys, beacons, beacon-towers or turrets, jetty-heads, rocks, and any convenient natural object. It does not include ordinary landmarks, mooring buoys, or mooring posts, &c. Buoys and beacons, herein termed marks, are distinguished by colour and by the form of top-mark. The term starboard means the right hand side approaching from seaward ; the term port means the left hand side. The term separation of channels is given to the marks placed at the seaward extreme of middle grounds ; those at the inshore extreme are named junction of channels marks. The marks on shoals of small extent are named isolated danger marks. 1. Starboard hand marks are painted red, and surmounted by a top-mark of conical shape ; if necessary, they are numbered by even numbers commencing from seaward. 2. Port hand marks are painted black, and surmounted' by a top-mark of cylindrical shape ; if necessary, they are num- bered by uneven numbers commencing from seaward. 3. Separation of channels marks are painted white and black in horizontal stripes, and surmounted by a top-mark formed by two cones, bases together. 4. Junction of channels marks are painted white and red in horizontal stripes, and surmounted by a top-mark formed by two cones, points together. 5. Isolated danger marks are painted red and black in horizontal stripes, and surmounted by a top-mark of spherical shape. See chart, No. 1,598."], [43, "Chap. I.] 15 PILOT SIGNALS. \u2014 BUOYAGE. 6.

DOCKS, &C. \u2014 Dry dock accommodation for small vessels may be found at Paimpol and Granville, and for vessels of large size at Cherbourg, Havre, Dieppe, Calais, and Dunkerque. There are also gridirons and patent slips at some of the less important harbours. The dimensions and capabilities of all these are given in the descrip tions of the different ports. There are no dry docks in any of the Channel islands. COAL can be obtained without difficulty and at moderate prices at all the principal ports. Recent legislation has favoured the use of French coal, but neither the quantity nor the quality required can be obtained from the French pits, consequently the best English coal is always in stock, though the quantity imported slightly decreases. COMMUNICATIONS.\u2014 Caution.\u2014 The large steamers of the Compagnie Generate Transatlantique start from the docks of Havre for New York. German transatlantic steamers call at Dieppe and See chart, No. 1,598."], [45, "Chap. I.] 17 DOCKS.\u2014 TELEGRAPH CABLES.\u2014 CONSULS. Cherbourg both outward and homeward bound. Many lines of steamers, some of very high speed, cross the Channel between French and English ports, e.g., between the French coast, Channel islands, and Southampton, Cherbourg and Southampton, Havre and South ampton, Caen and Newhaven, Honfleur and Newhaven, Dieppe and Newhaven, Boulogne and Folkestone, Calais and Dover, &c. This cross-channel traffic is a source of considerable danger of collision to vessels bound up or down Channel, especially in thick or foggy weather, and at all times calls for the utmost vigilance and care on approaching and crossing the lines of route taken by these fast steamers. TELEGRAPH CABLES.\u2014 Several telegraph cables cross the English channel, viz., between Pontusval and Salcombe, cape d'Antifer and Beachy head, Dieppe and Beachy head, cape Grisnez and Dover, Sangatte (near Calais) and the South Foreland ; a cable also leaves the shore at Huttes d'Oyes near Gravelines, and is laid to the Danish island of Fano. Guernsey is in direct cable communi cation with Dartmouth and with the other Channel islands ; and Jersey with Pirou on the French shore. The points at which these cables leave the shore will be found more particularly mentioned in the detailed description of the coast. Mariners should always be careful not to anchor near the known position of a telegraph cable. LIFE-SAVING STATIONS.\u2014 Life-saving stations have been created, and are supported by private enterprise, on the most exposed parts of the French coast. The most important are provided with life-boats ; others of less importance, or where a life-boat would not be serviceable, with mortar or rocket apparatus. CONSULAR OFFICERS.\u2014 For the convenience of vessels entering French ports, it may be useful to state that British Consular officers are stationed at the following places : \u2014 At Havre there is a Consul-General and also a Vice-Consul.

ROUNDING USHANT FROM THE SOUTHWARD- CAUTION. \u2014 Steam vessels approaching the English channel from the southward are often glad to make Ushant for the purpose of ascertaining their exact position before shaping course up channel ; otherwise, there is no reason to pass close round this island commen surate with the dangers which may attend the attempt. The gain in distance by steering from off cape Villano to a point 10 miles west of Ushant, instead of 40 miles west, is, if intending to make the Start, only 5 miles, or if intending to make Portland bill, 8 miles, in a total distance of 530 miles. Vessels approaching Ushant should be on their guard against the danger of being set eastward of their reckoning, and must exercise the greatest caution in rounding it. That island is surrounded by dangers in all directions ; rocks are numerous and far from the land ; fogs and thick weather are not uncommon ; the tidal streams are strong, and the extent of their influence seaward undetermined ; no dependence can be placed on seeing the powerful lights, or hearing the fog signals, in thick weather, and when such prevails the island should be given a wide berth ; the lead should be kept constantly going, at a proper speed, and the vessel kept in depths exceeding 60 fathoms, allowing for the height of the tide, as mentioned on the following page. In fine weather Ushant may be rounded at a distance of about 10 miles, unless bound for western French ports, when a somewhat nearer approach may be permitted. Sailing vessels should in all circumstances give Ushant and its dangers a wide berth. Approach to Ushant. \u2014 Currents.\u2014 In approaching Ushant the effect of a possible current requires careful consideration, for current in this vicinity being merely a temporary movement of the water resulting from recent, and probably remote, gales, the direction may differ from that indicated by the run of the swell. It is known * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 Channels between lie d'Ouessant and the mainland, No. 2,694 ; scale, m = 15 inches.

II.] APPROACHING USHANT -TIDES.-SOUNDINGS.-CAUTION. 19 that westerly gales forcing the water into the bay of Biscay cause it there to accumulate until it forms a head of water, which then flows northward along the French shore, and north-westward across the mouth of the English channel ; but it is improbable that the effect of this (the Rennel) current is ever experienced within 20 miles of Ushant, as it will be deflected off that island by the Chausee de Sein, and the usual set near Ushant is undoubtedly to the eastward. The Rennel current does not appear to be frequently experienced to any great extent, but it may attain a rate of 1 or 1^ knots an hour, and the knowledge of its possible existence should be duly considered when navigating in its vicinity. Tidal streams near Ushant. \u2014 North-westward of Ushant, 4 or 5 miles off-shore, the flood stream sets north-eastward, and the ebb south-westward, at the rate of 3 or 4 knots during springs, the flood stream turning more eastward, and thus setting more directly towards the rocks, as the tide slacks. Between Ushant and the Saints the flood stream sets eastward and the ebb westward, turning at high and low water at Brest, so that if the Saints be passed about the time of low water at Brest (corresponding exactly with the time of low water at Ushant) the indraught in this locality will be very strong. In the offing the stream continues to run for 3 hours after high and low water. Soundings Off Ushant. \u2014 Recent soundings obtained (1892) by the French Government confirm the conclusion formerly based upon the comparatively scanty soundings previously shown, that the bottom for many miles around Ushant is so generally level, with innumerable local irregularities, as wholly to preclude any attempt to judge the distance from the shore, in thick weather, by the lead alone ; but in thick weather the lead (and the lead only can give safety) should be kept constantly going. It is apparent that a ship bound north will pass well clear of Ushant if care is taken, by continually sounding, at a proper speed, to keep in depths exceeding 60 fathoms ; but due allowance must be made for the range of the tide, which, near Ushant, at springs, exceeds 3 fathoms. A little over 4 miles north of Ushant is a remarkable depression, 7 miles in length in a N.E. by E. and S.W. by W. direction, and one mile and a half in breadth, in which the depths are from 70 to 105 fathoms. CAUTION.\u2014 Fogs near Ushant.\u2014 As explained at page 11, it is not always possible to determine from the shore the existence See chart, No. 2,691.

II. of fog banks in the offing, and when the signal is dependent oh steam an hour may elapse from the time it is judged necessary to use the fog signal before it is brought into play ; moreover, it is known that large areas of silence may, and do, exist round many fog stations ; so that although the lights on Ushant are of great brilliancy, and the fog signals most powerful, no confidence can be felt in thick weather of seeing the lights or hearing the fog signals, and many vessels have been lured to destruction by trusting to them in weather which appeared only a little thick to the observer on board. Leaving the Channel. \u2014 Steam vessels leaving the channel for the southward should, if possible, sight and pass Ushant about 10 miles distant for a departure. In thick weather they should keep well clear. Sailing vessels, except those from western French ports, should not as a rule sight it ; but, even with a fair wind, make every effort to obtain good westing, bearing in mind that the prevailing winds and set of the ocean, being from that direction, have a tendency to set them towards Ushant and into the bay of Biscay, when southward of it ; therefore, it is of the highest importance to keep well to the westward. USHANT, or ILE D'OUESSANT, lies 10 miles westward of the western extreme of the coast of France. It is about 4-j miles long W. by N. and E. by S., about 2 miles wide, and its highest part, towards the North-east, is 195 feet above the level of the sea. In fine weather the island is visible from 15 to 20 miles distant, the outline appear ing rugged and uneven, and the shore composed of precipitous rocky cliffs of granite formation. (See view on Admiralty chart, No. 2694.) It is surrounded by dangers, but has three bays in which small vessels find temporary shelter. There are two lighthouses on *he island ; one at the north-eastern extreme, the other at the north-western. The inhabitants, about 2,500 in number, are chiefly employed in rearing cattle and as fishermen ; many of the latter are well acquainted with, and can act as pilots for, the passages in the vicinity, rendered dangerous by the numerous islets and rocks, covered and uncovered, lying between the island and the mainland, as well as by the great strength of the tidal streams ; see \" Rounding Ushant,\" page 18. The people, generally, speak pure Breton. The only village on the island is Lampaul, situated at the head of a bay on the south-western side. In other parts the houses are scattered, forming only small hamlets. Postal communication is See ohart, No. 2.694."], [49, "Chap.

Supplies. \u2014 Wood is scarce, but water and other supplies can be obtained in moderate quantities ; for fuel, the natives find a substitute in dried seaweed. LIGHTS. \u2014 On Creac'h point, at the north-western extreme of the island, is a circular tower, with black and white horizontal bands, from which is exhibited, at 223 feet above high water, an electric, group-flashing, uhite light, with a period of 10 seconds; each group consists of two flashes in quick succession, occupying 2\\ seconds ,- the interval between the groups being 1\\ seconds. The light is visible in clear weather 21^ miles, but the intensity of the flashes enables the glare to be seen considerably beyond that distance. It is partially obscured eastward in the direction of the Four rock light by the intervening higher points of Ushant. Stiff point. \u2014 On Stiff point, near the north-eastern extreme of the island, and on the northern side of the Baie du Stiff, stands a conspicuous white lighthouse, consisting of two round towers united, 85 feet high, from which, at 272 feet above high water, is exhibited a red and white flashing light, with eclipses every 20 seconds, and showing a red flash alternately' with two white flashes. In clear weather the white flashes are visible 23 miles, the red flashes 21 miles. Fog Siren. \u2014 At Pern point, 6 cables south- westward of Creac'h point lighthouse, is a fog signal station. From it, during foggy weather, a powerful steam siren is sounded every forty seconds, giving two blasts, each of three seconds' duration, separated by an interval of tivo seconds. The sound may be heard several miles in calm weather ; see Fog signals, page 11. It is proposed also to establish a fog trumpet at Stiff point. A Life-Boat is stationed at Lampaul. Semaphores. \u2014There are Semaphore stations near both light houses ; see page 12. Baie du Lampaul is the port of Ushant ; it is on the south western side of the island, and is exposed to the whole force of south-westerly gales. It is only used by small vessels, although the water is deep over a sandy bottom which shoals gradually towards its head, thus rendering anchors less liable to drag with a westerly See chart, No. 2,694."], [50, "22 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE.

The dangers to be avoided in entering this bay are the Jument rock, a ledge named the Basse Bridy, and the Leurvas rocks.

Stiff point lighthouse, a little open northward of the Corce rock about E. by N., leads into Lampaul bay, between Basse Bridy ledge and Leurvas rocks. There is anchorage in from 12 to 7 fathoms, sandy bottom, northward of the Corce, which may be rounded close-to on all sides, but the small coasters using this port pass south ward of it and anchor near the head of the bay, southward of the Men-ar-BIanc rocks, where a mooring buoy is placed for the con venience of those weighing and requiring to run a warp out. There is also a small harbour southward of the village, enclosed by jetties, where coasters and fishing-boats ground. The bay is rarely without much swell. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots reside at Lampaul, but have nothing but small open boats ; consequently, with a south-westerly wind and a flood tide it is seldom possible for them to board vessels. Should a pilot be required, it is important to attract their attention by signal, as so many outward bound vessels not requiring them pass close to the island. Chaussee de Keller. \u2014 At 2 miles N.N.E. \\ E. from Corn Pern at the western extreme of Ushant, and 3 miles N.W. by W. \\ W. from Stiff point lighthouse, is Basse Callet, a small patch of 11 fathoms, with from 21 to 28 fathoms close round it, forming the western extreme of the Chaussee de Keller, which is the chain or causeway of rocks extending N.W. by W. \\ W. 1^ miles from the western part of Keller isle.

Baie du Stiff, on the north-eastern side of Ushant, affords tem porary anchorage for small vessels, and a mooring buoy lies in about 13 fathoms ; the bay is, however, open to the eastward and even with westerly winds there is always a heavy swell. The dangers to be avoided on entering are, the Men-Corn, Douellan rocks, and Ligounec bank, off its southern point ; and, the Gorle-bian rock in the middle of the bay. The Men-Corn and Gorle-bian rocks uncover at half tide and are both marked by stone beacon turrets showing 6 feet above high water, springs ; that on the Gorle-bian rock was washed away in March 1896, but will probably be at once re-built. Baie de Pen-ar-Roch, on the southern side of the island, is very exposed, and not to be approached in bad weather. There is a mooring buoy about 1^ cables from the shore, and there is a small pier where passengers and goods from or to Brest, Le Conquet, and Molene are landed or embarked. Tides and Tidal streams. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, on the shores of Ushant at 3h. 46m. ; springs rise 19\u00a3 feet, neaps 13| feet above low water, ordinary springs. About 6 miles off the north-western coast of the island, the flood sets N.E. 3 knots ; the ebb, S.W. 2tj knots, the rate of both streams increasing rapidly as the island is approached. About 2 miles south-westward of Ushant, the flood stream divides, one portion rushing through the Fromveur channel, the other up the north-western side of the island, attaining at times near the shore a maximum speed of 7 knots. The ebb stream divides similarly off the north-eastern end of the island, but does not run with quite so great force. About half flood an eddy makes down on the north-western side of the island, sometimes extending nearly 2 miles off-shore ; the stream, therefore, on that side and within that limit runs for nine hours to the S.W. A similar eddy forms at half ebb close to the southern end of the island, the stream, for about a mile off-shore, running north-westward for nine hours across the entrance to the Baie du Lampaul.

A vessel is south-westward of all these dangers so long as this lighthouse is open westward of Runiou beacon bearing N. by W. There are many intricate passages and three deep channels through these dangers, viz. : \u2014 The passage du Fromveur, Chenal du Four, and Chenal de la Helle ; the first only, in case of necessity, may be taken during daytime by a stranger ; the others are very difficult, with sunken rocks lying nearly in the fairway. Passage du Fromveur, with from 25 to 35 fathoms, runs parallel with the southern coast of Ushant, along which are many rocks and rocky patches, but none extend more than 5 cables from the shore. The principal danger is on the southern side of the channel, off the broken rocky isle of Loedoc, from which a rocky ledge extends W.N.W. nearly 5 cables, and at its extreme is Men Tensel, a detached rock which uncovers 15 feet at the lowest tides. Most of the rocks on this ledge, however, are visible at half ebb, and there as generally broken water over them at other times, but care must be taken to avoid a sunken rock with only 12 feet, about 1\\ cables north-westward of Men Tensel. The channel at this spot is less than a mile in width. The tidal streams take the direction of the channel, about E. by N. i N. and W. by S. -J- S., but they are so rapid as to alarm persons unused to its navigation, especially at springs, when the whole surface of the water has the appearance of breakers. Directions. \u2014 Bound through the Fromveur channel from the southward ; when about 2 miles South from Runiou point, steer about E.N.E. towards the Youc'h rock, lying southward of the eastern end of Ushant, and keep it well open eastward of Men-cren, Men-ar froud, on which is a beacon turret, and of all the rocks off the southern shore. The Men-Corn beacon will open eastward of Youc'h as Men-ar-froud is passed at 3 or 4 cables distance, and that beacon should then be kept well open to clear all dangers on the island side, observing on the other hand that when Loedoc bears southward of S.E. the ship is clear of danger on the southern side. Youc'h and Men-Corn should each be given a berth of 3 or 4 cables in passing, and when Stiff point lighthouse is on with Men-Corn, or ile de Bannec is opened eastward of Loedoc, a course may be steered to the north-eastward as desired. If from the North or North-eastward ; round the eastern end of Ushant about a mile distant, and, steering about W.S.W., pass within 3 or 4 cables of Men-Corn, Youc'h, and Men-ar-froud, as just described. See charts, Nos. 2,694 and 2,643."], [53, "Chap. II.] 25 FROMVEUR AND FOUR CHANNELS. When abreast of Men-ar-froud, or when Loedoc is eastward of E.S.E., the chief danger on the southern side has been passed ; and, when the southern end of Bannec bears E. -tV N. and the western end of Ushant N. by E. \\ E., a course may be steered to clear the Saints ; or, if bound to Brest, a S. by E. \\ E. course for 10 miles, due allow ance being made for tide, and an occasional bearing of the Pierres Noires lighthouse is very useful for this purpose, leads westward of the Pierres Vertes, the highest of which uncovers 7 feet at low water, springs, and also of the westernmost patch of the Pierres Noires, on which there are 13 feet at that time. A course may then be steered towards the Goulet de Brest, with the lighthouse on Petit Minou point on with the lighthouse on Portzic point bearing East. Chenal du Four. \u2014 Notwithstanding its many dangers, this intricate channel is practicable for ships of the deepest draught at all times of tide, and much used both by day and night by vessels passing between Brest and the Channel ports, not only on account of the distance saved, but also from the comparatively smooth water found within it during westerly winds. By night, the lights on point St. Mathieu, Kermorven, and Corsen, with that at Trezien, greatly facilitate this passage. Its southern entrance is about one mile S.W. of cape St. Mathieu, and the leading mark through, after the Grande Vinotiere beacon turret has been passed, is, the lighthouse on Kermorvan point on with that on St. Mathieu point, bearing S. \\ E. ; but, the navigation of the southern part of the channel, from the entrance to this point, is rendered difficult by the numerous dangers, of which the chief are, the Vieux Moines and Bossemens Orientales rocks, the Basse du Chenal marked on its eastern side by a red buoy with staff and ball, and Basse des Renards on its western side by a black buoy. A course of about N. by E. leads towards the Grande Vinotiere beacon turret, between which and a rock with only 12 feet water westward of the Petite Vinotiere and only 2\\ cables south eastward of the Grande Vinotiere, a vessel should pass ; then hauling more eastward to bring the leading mark on, which mark must be strictly maintained to avoid the numerous shoals at the northern entrance, until Le Four lighthouse bears E. by N. The St. Paul, Tendoc, and Valbelle shoals, each marked by a black buoy, are passed close to on the starboard hand ; whilst the Basse St. Pierre, Chaussee des Pourceaux, and Platresses red buoys, as well as the red beacon turret on the N.E. rock of the Platresses, are left on the port hand. By night, vessels passing westward of the Grande Vinotiere, with Trezien and Corsen leading lights in line, must be on their guard, as See chart, No. 2,694."], [54, "[Chap. II, 26 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. the stream often sets strongly on that danger, and, if necessary, keep Trezien light a little open westward of Corsen light until well past it. Chenal de la Helle is available for ships of all classes ; it lies westward of the Four channel, from which it is separated by the Platresses, a rocky ledge three quarters of a mile long North and South. The direction of this channel is about N.N.W. \\ W. and S.S.E. \\ E., and it unites with the Four channel about 2 miles northward of Kermorvan point, There are, as previously stated, other channels through and amongst the islands used by those locally acquainted, which, however, are best understood by reference to the chart. Tidal Streams. \u2014 Through the channels between Ushant and the mainland the flood stream runs to the north-eastward and northward, the ebb to the south-westward and southward. The first of the flood stream making about a quarter of an hour before low water at Ushant, or 2\\ hours before high water at Dover, in the southern part, and rather later in the northern part, and the ebb stream is the converse of the flood. In the Chenal du Four, the greatest strength of the stream is 6 or 7 knots, at springs, in the narrows at the Vinotiere ; which is reduced to 3 or 4 knots northward of the Platresses. Near the Four rock the flood stream begins to bend away to the eastward, and in the imme diate vicinity of that rock an eddy in the opposite direction is formed. Northward of these channels, between Ushant and ile de Bas, the flood stream sets about East and the ebb stream West. In the offing of the Roches de Porsal, the flood stream does not make until nearly three hours after low water at Ushant, and the ebb stream about three hours after high water at Ushant, each stream attaining a speed of 3 to 4 knots, and as much as 5 knots near the rocks, at springs. Near the shore, the streams turn 1\\ hours sooner than in the offing. The COAST between Ushant and ile de Bas, 43 miles to the eastward, is moderately high and in clear weather may be seen from 15 to 18 miles distant ; it is, however, fronted by rocks, some of which are nearly 3 miles in the offing and from a distance have the appearance of houses. Unless absolutely necessary, it is prudent to give this part of the coast a berth of 5 or 6 miles, especially at night when it should not be approached within a depth of from 46 to 36 fathoms ; the bottom at this depth is grey sand mixed with small pebbles, of various colours, resembling nuts.

L'ABERILDUT.\u2014 Depths.\u2014 The entrance to this tidal port bears E. by S. f S. nearly 12 miles from Stiff point lighthouse, Ushant, and S. | E. 3^ miles from the Four rock ; it is the only place between Brest and the river Abervrac'h where vessels drawing 12 feet can enter at high water, springs, and be perfectly sheltered from all winds. During neaps there are only 8 feet at high water. At low water, the port dries completely out 2 cables beyond the entrance, but, the bottom being soft sand, vessels lie aground with great safety. It is much frequented by Brest pilots and fishermen from the adjoining coast ; a considerable trade is also carried on, the principal exports being stone and sand ; a great deal of the stone used in the Thames Embankment came from here. Directions. \u2014 To enter l'Aberildut ; when about 2 miles off the entrance, bring the tower of Bredes church, seen amongst the trees about 2 miles inland, on with the tower of Lanildut church E. | S. ; this mark leads up to the entrance, passing about one cable northward of the Pierre de Laber rock, which uncovers 12 feet at low water and is marked by a red beacon turret, and between the Trois Pierres on the North and Men-Garo rock on the South, which latter covers at equinoctial tides only. On arriving at the entrance, which is about 150 yards wide, pass about 50 yards southward of a black rock con nected with the northern point of entrance by a jetty ; run on, keeping about 50 or 60 yards from the northern shore, and on round ing the point which forms the western side of the port of Laber, if having come in for shelter only, anchor when abreast of the first houses in that village ; but, if going to take in or discharge cargo, run on up to the quay where the grounding places are excellent, the bottom being sand and mud. The tide runs very strongly to the S.W. across the entrance during the first hour of the ebb, requiring a fresh breeze to stem it. It is advisable for a stranger to take a pilot, or, as there are none specially belonging to the port, a fisherman does as well. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in l'Aberildut at 3h. 58m. ; the tide rises 13 feet at ordinary springs, and 8 feet at Set chart, No. 2,694."], [56, "28 [Chap. II. USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. neaps, above the grounding places off Laber, where the bottom dries about 9 feet at the lowest tides. The streams of flood and ebb within the entrance attain a considerable strength, the ebb as much as 3 knots between the entrance points. Le FOUR is a large and remarkable black rock, broad at the top and 17 feet high, lying N.W. \\ W. about a mile from Melgorne point, the north-western extreme of the coast of France ; and, E. \\ S. 10| miles from Stiff point lighthouse, Ushant, LIGHT. \u2014 From a lighthouse on the Four rock, 85 feet high from base to vane, is exhibited, at 92 feet above high water, a light showing fixed ivhite during tliirty seconds, followed during the next thirty seconds by a group of eight distinct flashes with an eclipse between each flash ; thus the light is described as fixed and group flashing ; in clear weather it is visible from a distance of 15 miles. Fog trumpet. \u2014 During thick or foggy weather, a steam trumpet sounds blasts of five seconds'1 duration, each blast being followed by an interval of twenty seconds ; see fog signals, page 11. Argenton. \u2014 E. by S. \\ S. about 1^ miles from the Four light house, is the entrance to this little harbour, which dries at low water, but has a bottom of sand and mud, is protected by a jetty about 75 yards long, and is completely land-locked, though the surf makes itself felt in north-westerly gales. There are 14 feet water in the harbour at high water, springs, but not more than half that depth at neaps. The only practicable channel to the entrance is between the Four rocks and the Petit Melgorne, but its approaches are so barred by dangers as to render it hazardous for even the smallest vessels to attempt except in the hands of a skilful local pilot. A rather extensive fishery exists here, and the coasting trade is carried on by about 60 small vessels calling annually. Semaphore. \u2014 At 1\\ miles northward of the entrance to Argenton is a Semaphore station on point Landunvez ; see page 12.

H.] ARGENTON.\u2014 PORTSAL.\u2014 CAUTION. 29 Portsal or Porsal.\u2014 This port, which is fronted by the roches de Porsal, comprises three distinct bays ; the western bay is that of Trernazan or du Chateau, the second is the bay of Kersaint, and at the head of the eastern bay stands the village of Porsal. In bad weather, the swell and surf within the port are so great as to render it dangerous. There is very little trade and no wharf s approachable by vessels ; loading or discharging is done by boats when the tide suits. Depths. \u2014 The harbour is dry throughout its whole extent by three quarters ebb ; vessels of 13 feet draught can enter at springs, and of 6 or 7 feet draught at neaps ; the bottom is generally of sand, but a mass of rocks which covers only at high tides occupies the middle of the harbour. Several channels lead to Porsal but all are intricate and none should be attempted without a pilot. The leading mark for the South or inner channel is, lurch rock just closed in by Men Gouziane E.N.E. ; both of these rocks are marked by beacons. From the North-west, the leading mark through the reefs to the inner channel is lurch rock on with Ploudalmezeau spire. Life-Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Porsal. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots of Porsal cruise near the Four rock and out side the roches de Porsal in small cutters, which may be known by their having an anchor on the mainsail, as described at page 14. They are qualified to conduct vessels as far as Brest, and if required for the inner channels of the roches de Porsal are reputed to be the best to be obtained. CAUTION. \u2014 The coast in the vicinity of Porsal and Four rocks is of moderate height, but being bordered by numerous dangers it should not be approached at night or in thick weather within the depth of 45 fathoms ; the bottom at that depth is generally of grey sand mixed with flint and other stones. L'Aberbenoit. \u2014 Between Porsal and l'Abervrac'h is a deep bight encumbered by rocks and shoals, into which the river Aberbenoit flows, forming a harbour of but little importance, though accessible to vessels of 11. feet draught, at springs, and of 4 to 6 feet draught at neaps ; it is approached by a deep entrance channel on either side of the plateau de Rusven, a reef which dries in places at low water.

L' ABERVRAC'H.\u2014 The entrance to this river, nearly 6 miles eastward of Porsal and 4 miles westward of Correjou bay, is difficult of access, being much encumbered by numerous shoals, islets, and rocks. It, however, affords good shelter to wind-bound ships ; the outer roadstead is just within the entrance and about 1| cables south-eastward of the black and white beacon turret on the Petit Pot-de-Beurre rock. Depths. \u2014 The outer road has from 6 to 8 fathoms water over a sandy bottom at the lowest tides. The inner road is H miles in a S.S.E. | E. direction from the outer road, and the least depth is 5 fathoms, except 1\u00a3 cables north-eastward of Cezon isle, where there are only 2\\ fathoms. The whole space between the outer and inner roads affords good anchorage to vessels of the largest size. The roads are separated from the port by a mole about 260 yards in length, where vessels discharge cargo and where water may be obtained. There are also two beaching places on the left bank of the river, one in Anges bay, the other a little farther eastward in St. Antoine bay ; the bottom in both bays is soft mud and dries 6^ feet at the lowest tides. Great expense has been incurred in the beacons, lights, and buoyage of this harbour, but since the increase of steam navigation its trade steadily declines, though a large number of boats are engaged in the fisheries. LIGHTS. \u2014 The entrance to Abervrac'h river is facilitated at night by the following lights : \u2014 lie Vrac'h. \u2014 A fixed red light shown on the eastern side of the entrance from a white square tower, 36 feet high, erected on the southern part of ile Vrac'h. This light is 59 feet above high water, and is visible 6 miles. Lanvaon. \u2014 A fixed ivhite light from a white square tower on Lanvaon heights, which bears S.E. by E. \\ E. If miles from the tower on ile Vrac'h. This light is 171 feet above high water, and when in line with the light on ile Vrac'h leads through the Grand chenal to the entrance of the Abervrac'h. It is visible 14 miles, through an arc of 36\u00b0, i.e., 18\u00b0 on either side of the line of direction. Two fixed lights are also exhibited on the left or western bank of the river, one ivhite, at the head of St. Antoine creek ; the other green, on the eastern point of Palue beach ; when in line, they show the direction of the inner anchorage. These lights are respectively 49 and 29 feet above high water, and are visible 11 and 8 miles. Life-Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at ile Vrac'h. See chart, No. 2,644."], [59, "Chap.

DIRECTIONS \u2014 The Abervrac'h river can be entered by three channels, all of which are accessible to the deepest ships at high water, and one, the Grand chenal, is available at any time of tide ; it leads in from the westward passing southward of Libenter ledge. The Chenal de la Malouine leads in from the northward between Malouine and Pendante ledges. The third is the Pendante channel between Libenter ledge and the Tendante ; its navigation is difficult, and should not be attempted without a pilot. The Grand Chenal is practicable for vessels of the deepest draught by day or night, with a fair wind, and wide enough for coasters to turn through, the narrowest part of the channel being 1\\ cables wide. In approaching it from the westward, as soon as they are seen, bring the steeple of Plouguerneau church and the white light towers on ile Vrac'h and on Lanvaon heights in line, or, at night, the white and red lights in line bearing S.E. by E. \\ E., which is the leading mark in ; but, when coming from the northward, the steeple of Ploudalmezeau church must be kept well open westward of the steeple of Lampaul church S. S.W. until the leading mark is on, in order to pass westward of the western patches of Libenter ledge ; there are never less than 25 feet on these patches, but a heavy sea runs over them in bad weather. In running through this channel, the leading mark must be kept exactly on, for although the vessel passes 1\\ cables southward of the South extreme of Libenter ledge, marked by a black buoy, and about the same distance southward of the Grand Pot-de-Buerre ledge, on which is a black beacon turret, yet it leads only 55 yards northward of a 9^-feet patch, named the Basse du Chenal, and 80 yards south ward of the beacon turret on the Petit Pot-du-Buerre, which at night may not be seen. Having passed this beacon turret the vessel may either come-to in the outer anchorage, or proceed southward with the light tower in St. Antoine bay on with that on Palue beach ; or, at night, with the white and green lights in line S.E. by S. This being the line of direction for the inner anchorage, a berth may be taken as convenient, mooring N.W. and S.E. ; or, if capable of taking the ground, the vessel can steer for one of the beaching places.

The beacon turret on the Petit Pot-de-Buerre exactly on with that on the Petite ile de la Croix S. by W. \\ W. leads through in not less than 20 feet ; the turret on the Petit Pot-de- Buerre should be passed close to on the starboard hand, when the vessel may anchor in the outer roads or proceed to the inner anchorage as before directed. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the river Abervrac'h at 4h. 14m. ; equinoctial springs rise 29 -feet, ordinary springs 22 feet, and ordinary neaps 16 feet above the level of the soundings ; neaps range 10 feet. ILE VIERGE is a mass of rocks but little above the level of the sea and without any vegetation ; between it and the shore is a passage used by coasters and small craft only, and also the little bay of Portz- Malo where they anchor close to the shore and ground as the tide falls. lie Vierge lies 2 miles eastward of the entrance to the river Abervrac'h, and N.W. by W. \\ W. 2\\ miles from the western point of Correjou bay ; it may be recognised from some distance by the square lighthouse erected 109 yards from its eastern extreme. LIGHT. \u2014 The lighthouse exhibits, at 108 feet above high water, a fixed white light varied every four minutes by a red flash, pre ceded and followed by a short eclipse. The light is an excellent guide for the entrance to Abervrac'h and also for Correjou bay ; it is visible 16 miles, and the eclipses are not total within a distance of 6 miles. From ile Vierge. the lighthouse on Bec-pol, Pontusval, bears E. -J- S. nearly 9 miles ; the shoals fronting this part of the coast, of which the principal are the Plateau du Lizen-Ven, Plateau du Guern, Plateau d'Aman-ar-Ross, and the Basses St. Tregarec, extend H miles seaward of this line and the coast recedes nearly 2 miles. In coming from the westward, a vessel will clear all these shoals by keeping the tower of Ploudalmezeau church well open westward of ile Vierge until the lighthouse on Bec-pol bears S.E. by E.

A short distance eastward of the eastern head is the north-western end of the Bazughen ledge, which from thence trends 2\\ cables in a south-easterly direction, its highest head uncovering 10 feet at the lowest tides. The Garrec-Crom ledge, northward of the Bazughen, covers at high water with the exception of one head at its eastern extreme. Depths. \u2014 The anchorage in this bay is south-eastward of Penvers ledge, and the depth is from 13 to 19 feet at low water, springs. The beaching place is southward of Penenes isle, but the bay is now quite abandoned by the coasting trade ; the bottom here is of sand, and it rises gradually towards the shore, at the foot of which it dries 16 feet above the lowest tides. Directions. \u2014 Correjou bay may be entered by two channels, the Western and Eastern channels ; the Western channel is between the coast and the southern part of the Lizen-Ven ledge ; the Eastern channel is between the Guern ledge and a ledge named the Chaussee de Carrec-Hir. To enter by the western channel, steer to the southward with ile Vierge lighthouse on a S. by W. bearing until the guard-house on the point of Kerisoc is on with the northern head on Penvers ledge S.E. \\ E. Proceed with this mark on until half way between this rock and the Andolven rocks, when ile Vierge lighthouse seen over a remarkable gap or cleft in the Andolven rocks, just to the left of the most northern rock, becomes the mark ; and, passing north ward of Penvers ledge, that mark leads between Garrec-Crom and the Bazughen, and about 22 yards northward of a 4-feet patch nearly in mid-channel. Vessels may anchor in about 16 feet, sand, with this mark on, when Penvers and Mean-Yan are in line. Do not haul more to the southward for an anchorage before the highest head on the Garrec-Crom is northward of N.N.E., for the south eastern head of the Bazughen bears S.SW from this head ; and, in steering to the southward, the highest head of the Garrec-Crom must not be brought more easterly than N. by E. \\ E. so long as the southern head on Penvers ledge is shut in southward of the North point of the bay. The swell is much felt in this bay above half tide, and, as no marks can be given for leaving it at night, it should only be used in the finest weather. The leading mark through the eastern channel is the steeple of Plouguerneau church on with the Mean-Yan rock bearing S.S.W. \\ W. ; See chart, No. 2,644.

The mark leads in not less than 7 fathoms until the vessel is about l^V cables from the Mean-Yan, when steer a little to port to pass eastward of it. After clearing the south-eastern edge of the ledge, bring Plouguerneau church steeple to bear as before, and it will lead close westward of the Garrec-Crom, when proceed as before directed. Semaphore.\u2014 About a mile eastward of the anchorage in Correjou bay is a Semaphore station on the high land of Kerisoc ; see page 12. Between the Baie de Correjou and Pontusval are the small tidal harbours of Treisseny and Kerlouan, of little or no importance. LIGHT. \u2014 On Bec-pol, Pontusval point, stands a square lighthouse, from whence, at 59 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed white light, with a red sector between the bearings S.E. by E. \\ E. and E. by N. \\ N. showing over the Basses St. Tregarec and the shoals westward, but which sector does not cover all the shoal ground when approached within 2 miles. The light is visible from a distance of 12 miles. PONTUSVAL, the entrance to which port is about one mile eastward of Bee-pol lighthouse, and 1^ miles north-westward of the Greve de Goulven, is the only place on this part of the coast where the crew of a vessel, driven on a lee shore, could hope to be saved. It berths a large number of coasters, but the bottom is hard, and, in strong gales from the northward, it is not an unfrequent occurrence to see them wrecked at their anchors. Depths. \u2014 The port completely dries out at low water as far as abreast of the western entrance point, and, from thence, the bottom gradually rises to the head of the port. It admits vessels of 11 feet draught at high water, ordinary springs ; and of 5 feet draught at neaps. A vessel is moderately well sheltered on the eastern side of the port in a little bay named La Chambre, in which the bottom dries 13^ feet above the lowest tides. The least depth at low water in the entrance channel, until abreast of the western entrance point, is 13 feet ; the channel is bordered on both sides by sunken rocks and crossed obliquely by the tidal streams. Telegraph Cable.\u2014 The telegraph cable from Salcombe is landed at this port. A Life-Boat and mortar apparatus, &c, are stationed at this port. See chart, No. 2,644."], [63, "Chap.

This mark leads between the two rocks Blanche de l'entree and Ar-Neuden or Fil, only about 70 yards apart ; the former is on the western side of the entrance and its summit is always above water ; the latter, which has on it a black beacon turret with cylindrical top-mark, 14 feet above the level of the highest tides, is on the eastern side and uncovers 12^ feet. When abreast of the Blanche de l'entree, steer a little more to starboard, to pass nearly midway between the Blanche du centre and Vran rocks ; the former lies on the western side of the channel and never covers, the latter on the eastern side and uncovers 27 feet. Pass rather nearer the Blanche than the Vran, and when near the Blanche du dedans, a rock one cable south-westward of Blanche du centre, steer for the Custom-house office on a S. by W. W. bearing and it will lead into La Chambre, on the eastern side of the port. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Pontusval at 4h. 25m., and the tide rises in La Chambre about 16-g feet at equinoctial springs, and 5 feet at neaps ; here the bottom dries 13^ feet above the level of the lowest tides. The COAST. \u2014 From the lighthouse on Bec-pol, Pontusval, ile de Bas lighthouse bears East 13\u00a3 miles ; between the two are the Greve de Goulven, Anse de Kernic, Port Nevez, and other small bays and creeks, places of little or no importance, and so encumbered by rocks and shoals as to be very dangerous to approach. The most outlying shoal in the neighbourhood is Queyn Cos, with 3^ fathoms ; its outer extreme is 2| miles from the nearest land, and E. 5 N. 4\u00a3 miles from Bec-pol light. Greve de Goulven. \u2014 This deep sandy bay affords shelter from westerly winds to vessels that can take the ground, but it is difficult of access, its entrance being full of rocks. ANSE de KERNIC, or, as it is sometimes called, the port de Plouescat, has a narrow entrance choked by rocks awash ; it has a sandy bottom which dries at half tide, but, at high water, springs, there are from 6 to 15 feet ; it is reported to be gradually silting up, and much land has been reclaimed from the sea on its borders. It is used only by vessels of from 60 to 80 tons, but having neither quay nor wharf, they discharge cargo into carts alongside when left by the tide.

II. lie de Siec* \u2014 This islet, lying between port Nevez and lie de Bas, from the western extreme of which its western rock, Golc'hedec, bears S.W. | W. 2| miles, is 5 cables long E.S.E. and W.N.W., and is connected with the land by a rocky ledge which uncovers at low water, thus affording shelter to an excellent anchorage well out of the tideway ; it was formerly much frequented by coasting vessels, with the wind from N.E. round by East to S.S.E. Approaching the anchorage from the westward, bring the spire of St. Pol-de-Leon college on with the Querelevran rock, which lies one cable southward of the western point of the isle, and anchor in from 5 to 6 fathoms, sand, when Golc'hedec rock, 2 cables north westward of the isle, bears N.N.E. 3 or 4 cables distant, Coming from the northward, bring the tower of Cleder church on with the eastern point of the entrance to port Nevez S.W. by S. ; this line passes 3 cables westward of Golc'hedec rock, but within 2 cables of the Calhic rock, which lies half a mile N.N.E. from the Golc'hedec and dries 18 feet at low water ; when arriving on the leading marks before given, steer in for the anchorage. ILE de BAS, or ile de Batz as it is frequently called, is a low island not visible from the deck of a vessel at a greater distance than 9 miles, though the lighthouse near its western end may be seen much farther ; it lies immediately off the promontory of Roscoff, and when bearing S.S.W. its outline becomes blended with the coast, from which it is only separated by a channel less than 7 cables wide at its narrowest part. It is about 2 miles long E.S.E. and W.N.W., and one mile wide ; it is bordered on its western, northern, and eastern sides by rocks and shoals extending from 5 cables to a mile from the shore, most of which cover at high water ; but one of the most prominent is the Penven, always above water, 4 cables northward from the central northern point of the isle. From ile de Bas light house, Bee-Pol lighthouse bears West 13\u00a3 miles, and Triagoz light house E. f N. northerly 16^ miles. LIGHT. \u2014 The circular lighthouse, erected on a mound half a mile from the western end of ile de Bas, exhibits a fixed and flash ing white light of the first order, showing a flash every minute. The light is 223 feet above high water, and is visible 22 miles. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on ile de Bas ; see page 12. * See Admiralty chart : lie de Bas and adjacent islands, No. 2,745 ; scale, m = 5 inches."], [65, "Chap. II.] ILE DE BAS.\u2014 CHANNEL INSIDE. 37 The island has a population of about 1,200, and on its southern side is the .village and harbour of Porz Kernoch. On its western side, the harbour is formed by a mole 570 yards in length connecting the shore with the Malvoch rock, marked on its south-eastern edge by a beacon ; and, on its eastern side, by a short jetty connecting that shore with the ile aux Moutons. The harbour dries at low water, has 6 feet at half tide, and 19 feet at high water, springs ; it is but little used now, the coasting trade decreasing with the growth of steam navigation and improved means of land transport. A Life-Boat and mortar apparatus are stationed at the western end of ile de Bas. CHANNEL between ILE de BAS and the COAST.\u2014 On account of its difficult navigation, this narrow channel is not much used except by vessels of light draught calling at Porz Kernoch or Roscoff. Vessels drawing about 19 feet may, however, if necessary, run through it with a fair wind at high water, slack. Anchorage. \u2014 The anchoring ground in this channel is comprised between the meridians of the chapel of Notre Dame de Bon Secours and the village of Porz Kernoch, and the depth is from 2 to \u00b1h fathoms. There is a long and narrow swash way with from 11 to 15 feet between the northern edge of the Traverse, a shallow shifting sand bank which bounds the anchorage eastward, and the sand-bank bordering the southern side of the isle ; and, although the stream here runs with great strength, coasters prefer it to the anchorage just described, as they are well sheltered, and, if necessary, can beach on the sands in Porz Kernoch, where the bottom dries only 6 or 7 feet at the lowest tides. Directions. \u2014 When bound through the chaunel between ile de Bas and the coast from the westward, Ste. Barbe western obelisk on with the white patch on the Loup rock S.E. by E., leads northward of the Basse Plate, a rock which only dries 3 feet, and on which a block of masonry about 10 feet high has been placed, on which a beacon turret is to be built, and of the Lavandieres rocks, which never cover, in not less than 5 fathoms towards the red beacon on the Oignon rock, which uncovers 22 feet and must be left to the southward. When about a cable westward of this rock, or when the eastern mill on ile de Bas and the little pyramid beacon on Kernoch isle (seen over the mole) are in line, steer E.S.E. for the anchorage, leaving the red beacon on the Tehibihan rock also on the starboard hand ; or, if not going to anchor, steer for point Pen-ar-Chleguer until the western mill (westward of Kernoch village) is on with Kernoch See chart, No 2,745.

When clear of this rock, the Duslen and Per Roc'h beacons in line lead out of the eastern entrance, passing from 20 to 30 yards only southward of the rock Ar-Chaden, which dries 15 feet at low water and forms the southern extreme of ile Pighet, on which latter is a beacon turret. Approaching the channel from the eastward, ile Pighet beacon turret on with the eastern mill leads to the entrance, and, as ile Pighet is neared, the leading mark already given will come on, and the marks used from the westward will serve successively from the eastward ; but, it should be remembered, that to navigate this channel at any time the services of a pilot are indispensable. There is an anchorage of small extent within ile Pighet, over a bottom of gravel and broken shells, where a vessel can wait for a favourable moment either to run through the channel or to enter port Roscoff. ROSCOFF.\u2014 This little tidal harbour is about a mile S.S.E. from the south-eastern extreme of ile de Bas ; it is formed by a mole or breakwater of solid construction extending with an outward curve from the western shore a distance of 575 yards. Works are also constructed at Penar-Vil, on the opposite side, to break the force of the sea during north-easterly gales ; in bad weather, however, the swell within the harbour is so great as to cause inconvenience and even danger. The town has railway connection through St. Pol de-Leon with the general system of France ; it has a population of about 1,000, and a thriving trade is carried on by vessels up to 200 tons, both English and French ; fruit, vegetables, fish, &c, are the chief exports. Depths. \u2014 It is accessible to vessels of 12 feet draught at high water, springs, and to those of 5 or 6 feet draught at neaps. The grounding places dry from 12 to 19 feet at the lowest tides ; the breakwater affords the only quay accommodation. LIGHTS.\u2014 A fixed white light, 22 feet above high water, visible 7 miles, is exhibited from an iron standard on the extreme end of the mole. A fixed red light, 38 feet above high water, visible 8 miles, is shown from an iron support at the life-boat station at the head of the harbour.

Approaching the port from the eastward, keep the south-eastern extreme of ile de Bas open northward of Tisaoson isle until within 8 cables of the latter, when the beacon turret on Astan rock will bear about N.N.W., then steer for Bloscon point, on the summit of which stands Ste. Barbe chapel, on a W. by S. f S. bearing, leaving the black beacon buoy of the Basse de Bloscon on the port hand, and the red beacon turret of Mean Guen Bihan on the starboard hand ; pass about half a cable northward of the fortified islet at the foot of this point, and run through the channel limited by this islet and Penar- Vil on the eastern side, and by the rocks Rannic and la Vache, marked by two red beacons, on the western side ; the outer of these two beacons stands only 164 yards north-westward of the islet. This channel is difficult to navigate even at high water, and impracticable on the ebb. Life-Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Roscoff.

MORLAIX RIVER.* \u2014 The entrance to Morlaix river is on the eastern side of Morlaix bay, between the ile de Callot and Primel point. Two principal channels lead into it, the eastern or Treguier channel, and the western or main channel ; the former, although not so deep as the latter, is generally preferred by coasters as its width admits of tacking. The channels unite between the isles Louet and Noire, which are half a mile apart, from whence the single channel takes a S. | E. direction for 3 miles through Morlaix road to the spot where it is joined by the little river Dourdu. Above this are quays on either side where vessels may lie aground, and a small gridiron, and still higher is the lock entrance to the wet dock, nearly a mile in length, with a width of from 82 to 193 feet, and a depth of from 8| feet at the upper to 16f feet at the lower end. The dimensions of the lock are much more than equal to the require ments of the basin.

From thence it shoals rapidly, and is reported to be only navigable for vessels of 9^ feet draught up to the wet dock. At the head of the wet dock is the town of Morlaix, with a population of about 14,000, and a railway station on the line connecting Rennes with Brest, The railway here crosses the river on a granite viaduct on 14 arches ; it is 973 feet in length and 183 feet above the level of the quays. The trade of the port is not large and decreases ; it is \"See Admiralty chart, Channels and Road of Morlaix, No. 2,744 ; scale, m - 5 inches SO 11886 . C 2"], [70, "USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [Chap. II. 42 carried on by vessels averaging 70 or 80 tons, about 400 entering the port annually. A few small steamers also use the port, and vessels of large size the roadstead. LIGHTS.\u2014 To enable vessels to enter Morlaix river at night, three lights are exhibited ; one from Noire islet, lying just within the entrance of the river, 4 cables south-eastward of Chateau du Taureau isle and half way between it and point Barnenez ; another from Louet isle If cables from point Pen Lann ; and, the third from Lande tower on the left or western bank of the river. Noire isle lighthouse is a square tower, from which is exhibited at 46 feet above high water, visible 12 miles, a fixed light showing red, green, and white sectors. It shows red from S. 27\u00b0 E. to S. 51\u00b0 W., green from S. 27\u00b0 E. to N. 75\u00b0 E., and white in other directions. Louet isle light is shown from a square white turret at 52 feet above high water ; it is a fixed ivhite light, with a green sector from S. 81\u00b0 W. to N. 37\u00b0 W., and is visible 9 miles. Lande square light tower, standing on the high land at the head of the road, exhibits, at 285 feet above high water, a fixed and flashing white light, with a two-min ute period, visible in clear weather 15 miles ; the flashes are preceded and followed by eclipses. Louet isle light on with Lande light S. by W. \u00a3 W. leads up to the Main channel, passing eastward of ile Ricard, until the vessel enters the green sector of ile Noire light. The Noire light on with Lande tower light S.S.W. \\ W. leads through the Treguier channel. Approaching Morlaix, or whilst waiting for a pilot, it is useful to know that with the whole of ile de Bas open northward of Tisaoson, a double-headed rocky islet 8 cables from the eastern end of ile de Bas, a vessel is northward of all the shoals in the mouth of the bay. Pilots.\u2014 Though the channels leading to Morlaix road and river are well marked by buoys, beacons, and lights, they are so narrow and intricate that a stranger should always take a pilot. Tides and tidal Streams.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Morlaix road at 4h. 53m. ; equinoctial springs rise about 31 feet, See chart, No. 2,744."], [71, "Chap. II.] MORLAIX.\u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 43 ordinary springs 24 feet, and ordinary neaps 18 feet above the sound ings ; neaps range 12 feet. The streams turn at high and low water, with half an hour's slack ; and at springs, when at their strength, run at the rate of 4 knots. Both streams follow the course of the various channels. Tide Signals, see page 12* should be made from Noire isle light house, but they are not attended to with regularity. It is better to trust to the indications afforded by the height of the water on the various rocks ; for instance, when the Cadou rock covers there are 17 feet in the Treguier channel. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Main channel. \u2014 Entering the Morlaix river by the Main channel, steer towards the eastern end of ile de Bas until Tisaoson isle is seen. Having passed between the red beacon turret on Astan rock and the black buoy off the Trepieds, 4^ milesapart, with Tisaoson bearing W. by N. about 3 miles, and the beacon turret on the Duon rocks W.S.W. about 1^ miles, the vessel will be at the entrance of the channel and more than half a mile N.E. E. from the Basse N.E. du Pot-de-Fer, a 4-feet patch marked by a red buoy on its north-eastern side, the patch lying E. f N. 2\\ cables from the Pot-de-Fer rock, which uncovers 7 feet at the lowest tides. From this rock, Louet isle lighthouse is just open westward of ile Ricard S. \\ W. ; and, the beacon turret of the Duon rocks is on with the chapel midway between St. Pol-de-Leon and Roscoff. Lande light tower on with Louet isle lighthouse S. by W. \\ W. leads through the Main channel eastward of the Pot-de-Fer and Duon rocks, and between the Vielle rock which dries 23 feet and is marked by a red beacon turret, and the Stolvezen, a 1-foot patch marked by a black buoy on its north-eastern edge. Vessels of light draught with a fair wind, or steamers with a proper rise of tide according to their draught, may continue with this leading mark on until abreast of the Calhic rock turret, passing eastward of ile Ricard and close to the beacon off its north-eastern end, as well as to that on the Morlouine rock which dries 4 feet at low water, springs. This is the narrowest part of the channel, as, only about 70 yards from the Morlouine rock, a small plateau of rocks on the opposite side is awash at low water. Before entering the narrows at ile Ricard, the Roche d'Equinoxe, with li fathoms, lies exactly on tho line of the leading mark ; it is easily avoided by opening the Lande light-tower west ward of Louet isle lighthouse until past it. There are also other See chart, No. 2,744."], [72, "[Chap. II. 44 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. patches of 15 and 9 feet in the narrows of the channel, though the general depths are from 4 to 6 fathoms until close up to the Morlouine beacon. When abreast of the beacon on Calhic rock, steer about South to pass between the beacon on the Corbeau rock and that on the western part of the ledge extending from the northern end of Chateau du Taureau islet, and then S. \\ E. past Louet isle and the red buoy marking the north-eastern edge of the Barre de slot ledge. When southward of Louet isle and clear of the Barre de slot, anchor as convenient in Morlaix road. Vessels of deep draught should pass westward of ile Ricard ; for which purpose, when nearing Vezoul isle, they should quit the line of Louet and Lande light towers in line, and bring the Pierre de Carentec (white) on with the white gable of Kergrist farmhouse S.S.W. \\ W. ; this leads between the Petit-Ricard and Noire rocks, both of which have beacons on them, and passes more than half a cable eastward of Fourche and Courgik beacons. When near the latter rock, which uncovers 14 feet, steer to bring the Paradis white beacon turret on with that of l'Enfer orTrepied JauneN.N.W., which leads between the foul ground south-westward of ile Ricard and tlie Bezinnennou beacon up to the Calhic rock, from whence the directions already given lead to Morlaix road. Caution.\u2014 Both the Calhic and Corbeau rocks extend a consider able distance from their beacon turrets into the channel, and great care is required in passing them. From the direction of the ile de Bas, the Main channel may be entered by passing southward of the Duon rocks ; for which the leading mark is, ile Pighet beacon turret on with the eastern mill on ile de Bas, N.W. westerly. This line passes close north-eastward of the Menk, Bisayers, Cochons noirs, and Vielle shoals, and leads up to the leading mark for the Main channel. Treguier channel.\u2014 Vessels intending to enter by this channel must ascertain that the tide has risen sufficiently to enable them to pass over the shallow flat, nearly awash at the lowest tides, lying in the narrows of the channel, and a mile in extent north-eastward and south-westward of Blanche isle. If coming either from the west ward or eastward outside all the shoals, bring Lande light tower on with ile Noire lighthouse S.S.W. \\ W. as soon as they are seen ; this See chart, No. 2,744."], [73, "Chap. II.] MORLAIX. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 ANSE DE PRIMEL. 45 leads half a mile westward of the black buoy on the Trepieds ledge ; eastward of the Pierre Noire, Tourghi, Grand Areman, and Chambre rocks, all marked by beacons ; and, westward of the Jaune, Cadou, Vielle Chambre, and Plate rocks, and also of the beacons on Petit Aremen, Menheur, and Blanche isle. The Pierre Noire dries b\\ feet, Tourghi 13 feet, Grand Aremen 13 feet, and Chambre 5\u00a3 feet ; the northern rock of the roches Jaunes dries 8 feet, the Cadou 12^ feet, Vielle Chambre 1^ feet, Petit Aremen 8 feet, and Menheur 13 feet. When abreast of the beacon on Blanche isle, steer W.S.W. until the western part of ile Ricard touches the eastern part of Chateau du Taureau isle S. \\ E. easterly, which is the line of direction for Morlaix road and also for the channel of the river. Entering by this channel at night, bring Lande fixed and flashing white light on with the red sector of Noire isle light S.S.W. W., to clear the reefs as before directed. Follow this line until the green sector of Louet isle light is entered, then haul up to W.S.W. until the green sector of Noire isle light opens out, when the vessel should keep away again to S.S.W. \\ W., and when out of the green sectors of both lights, she will be clear of the Barre de Hot shoal, and may anchor in Morlaix road as convenient. When near the Jaune rock in the Treguier channel, or the Fourche beacon in the Main channel, vessels may, if necessary, change from one channel to the other, the leading mark for this purpose being, the beacon turret on ile de Callot open southward of the Colombier rock. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the high land about one mile southward of Primel point, on the eastern side of Primel harbour ; see page 12. Anse de Primel. \u2014 When leaving Morlaix river for Lannion road, 10 miles E. by S. from Primel point, a vessel will pass the little harbour of Primel lying just westward of the point ; it has a very narrow entrance, for which the leading mark is, the white chimney of Repredou farmhouse on with a white mark on a wall. Vessels pass close to theZamegues rock, 14 feet above high water, and still closer to the red beacon on the Raoul rock, where is the narrowest part, and within which is a small anchorage where vessels of considerable draught may lie afloat at all times, but the holding ground is very bad, and the few small craft which use this harbour usually ground on sandy bottom higher up the bay. Strong See chart, No. 2,744."], [74, "[Chap. II. 46 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. northerly winds cause much swell within the harbour, and, at such times, the entrance is frequently closed by breakers. Vessels bouud for Lannion road may pass northward of the Chaises de Primel rocks by keeping the clock tower of Creiskar, St. Pol-de-Leon, on with the northern side of ile Vezoul W. \\ S. southerly, and when these rocks bear S.S.W. they may steer about E. by S. f S. to pass a cable southward of the Taureau rock which lies in front of Lannion roads, uncovers 28 feet at the lowest tides, and therefore is very seldom covered. The steeple of Guiodel church, on the left bank of the river Lannion, a little open north ward of the guard-house on Serves point, the northern point of the river entrance, or, by night, keeping within the white sector of Begleguer light, leads to the anchorage in the roads, which is exposed to the westward, but well sheltered from North round by East and South to S.W. The Coast between Primel point and the Lannion river is foul and bordered with dangers. S.E. by E. \\ E. 7 miles from Primel point is Locquirec, a little tidal harbour formed by partially enclosing a small bay on the eastern side of the promontory of that name by throwing out a stone pier about 130 yards in a south-westerly direction ; it affords indifferent shelter to a few small craft, Toul an-Hery, also an inconsiderable port, lies at the bottom of the sandy bay adjoining Locquirec, where the little river Douron falls into the sea. Toul-an-Hery affords better shelter than Locquirec, but it is more difficult of access. South-eastward from Locquirec point is pointe de Plestin with another deep sandy bay beyond ; and, N.E. \\ N. 3J; miles from Locquirec point is the Taureau rock off the bay of Lannion. The Farou and Felestrec, two dangerous rocks uncovering from 4 to 6 feet at low water, springs, lie between Locquirec and Lannion bay ; Lesangar mill on with point Landevelin leads westward of them and up to the entrance of Lannion river. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 The flood stream coming from the direction of ile de Bas runs directly over the plateau de la Meloine and towards the entrance of Lannion river, especially during the first 4 hours of the rising tide. Southward of the Meloine, it sweeps past Primel point and round the bay, setting to the northward along the eastern side and out between the Crapeaud rock and the isles off the point of the bay. The ebb stream takes an exactly See chart, No. 2,644."], [75, "Chap. II.] COAST. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 LANNION. 47 opposite direction. In the offing, both streams turn 2\\ hours later than in-shore. Lannion roads and port. \u2014 The dangers in approaching Lannion are numerous but well-marked. On the northern side the Crapeaud rock, ?>\\ miles north-westward from point Bihit, dries 13 feet at low water, springs, and has a beacon turret, as has also the Four rock which dries 12 feet ; and, a black conical buoy is moored westward of the f-fathoms patch lying westward of the Crapeaud beacon turret ; the Taureau reef uncovers 28 feet. On the southern side is the red turret on the Kinierbel rock. The anchorage in the roads is in from 7 to 3i fathoms. Entrance. \u2014 Depths. \u2014 The entrance to the river, named the Guer or Leguer, is between points Dourvin and Serves ; it is fronted by a bar which dries at low water from 3 to 5 feet, and may be entered by vessels of 17 feet draught at high water, springs, and of 11 feet at neaps. The town of Lannion, with a population of about 6,000, is 3t? miles from the entrance in a direct line and nearly double that distance following the sinuosities of the river, which is 160 yards wide at Lannion, and has extensive quays on either side considering its very limited trade. Tides. \u2014 Bore. \u2014 The flood stream begins to make up the river, at the entrance, about one hour after low water, but not until 2 hours later at Lannion, at which place the ebb stream does not begin until one hour after high water. The flood stream has a maximum speed of 2 knots, the ebb stream, of 2\\ knots. This river, as high as Lannion, is occasionally subject to the phenomenon known as the bore; this takes place only when strong south-westerly winds are veering to N.W., and always on the ebb ; the bore then comes up the river sometimes twice or thrice in one tide, and with sufficient violence to capsize small boats. LIGHT. \u2014 On Begleguer point, half a mile northward of the entrance to the river, from the western face of the keepers's house, is exhibited at 161 feet above high water and through an arc of 125\u00b0, a fixed light with green, white, and red sectors, visible respectively 7, 13, and 9 miles. The green sector covers 80\u00b0, from N. by E. f E. easterly to E. by S. \\ S. The white sector covers 13|\u00b0, from E. by S. \\ S. to S.E. by E. \\ E. easterly.

Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station at point Bihit on the northern side of Lannion roads ; see page 12. Between Lannion and Perros bays is a promontory of which ile Grande, almost connected with the shore, and point Ploumenac'h or Mean Ruz, are the north-western and north-eastern extremes. Besides the Crapeaud and adjacent ledges already mentioned, the coast, in this part is bordered by innumerable islets, rocks, and ledges, extending 2 miles from the north-western shore, and making any approach to it extremely dangerous. N. by W. \\ W. 5 miles from the centre of ile Grande is Triagoz lighthouse ; and Sept-iles light house lies N. by E. 2f miles from point Mean Ruz. PLATEAU de TRIAGOZ.\u2014 This dangerous ledge is about 4\u00a3 miles in extent W. by N. \\ N. and E. by S. \\ S. and about one mile wide ; its eastern end, on which are high rocks always uncovered, lies W.N.W. more than 4 miles from the Sept-iles. There are numerous rocky patches on the body of the ledge, but near its western end there is one, named the Fouillie, with only 14 feet water, from which Triagoz lighthouse bears S.E. \u00a7 E. 3 miles ; ile de Bas lighthouse W. by S. \\ S. 14^ miles ; and, the Fourchie, the highest rock at the eastern end of the ledge S.E. by E. \\ E. 3 miles. The summit of the Fourchie is 34 feet above the highest tides. The channel between the plateau de Triagoz and the Sept-iles is 4 miles wide, safe, and clear of danger. LIGHT. \u2014 The lighthouse, a square stone tower, 82 feet high, stands on Guen Bras rock, Plateau de Triagoz, and, from it, ile de Bas light bears W. f S. 16^ miles, and Sept-iles light E. by S. \u00a3 S. 6| miles. The lighthouse shows, at 98 feet above high water, a fixed and flashing light, the flashes are alternately red and white every half minute, visible 16 miles. Between the bearings N.N.E.

II.] PLATEAU DE TRIAGOZ. \u2014 SEPT-ILES.\u2014 LIGHTS. 49 Fog bell.\u2014 During foggy weather, a bell is sounded every four seconds ; see fog signals, page 12. Caution. \u2014 At night, as soon as the light on ile de Bas is sighted a vessel running eastward with the flood stream should steer to pass well northward of it, and after passing it should not bring it westward of S.W. by W. J W., in order to clear the Triagoz ledge by 3 miles ; for, this stream sets strongly to the South-east and does not turn in the offing until 3J hours after high water by the shore. The SEPT-ILES, or Seven isles, are high and barren, and in clear weather may be seen 21 miles distant. The lighthouse on them bears W. by N. 16-} miles from Heaux lighthouse, and E. by S. S. 6^ miles from Triagoz lighthouse. The isles, with their rocks, ledges, and adjacent shoals, occupy a space 2\\ miles wide and 4^ miles long in an E. by N. and W. by S. direction. LIGHT. \u2014 From a square lighthouse attached to a circular tower 52 feet high, on the eastern end of the southernmost isle, the ile-aux- Moines or Monk's isle, is exhibited, at 184 feet above high water, a fixed ivhite light, varied every three minutes by a flash. The flashes are preceded and followed by short eclipses which are not total within a distance of 6 miles. The light is dioptric, of the third order, and is visible 20 miles, except when bearing about S. 85\u00b0 W., when it is obscured through an arc of 3\u00b0 by Rougic isle and the eastern end of Bono isle. Bell-buoy. \u2014 To facilitate the navigation of the channel between the Sept-iles and the mainland, a black bell-buoy is moored south ward of the Dervinis, the southernmost rocks of the group. A Life-Boat is stationed at the ile-aux-Moines. The dangers between Sept-iles and the Plateau des Heaux mostly rise from depths of about 18 fathoms. Vessels passing outside Sept-iles and steering eastward should therefore keep well outside that depth. Sept-iles lighthouse kept bearing southward of West until Heaux lighthouse is seen, and it, in turn, kept well southward of S.E. when within 5 or 6 miles of it, leads well outside all dangers. The channel between Sept-iles and the mainland though narrow is available in case of need for the largest ships ; the tidal streams through it are very strong, at springs, rendering it dangerous to small vessels in bad weather with wind against tide.

PLOUMANAC'H LIGHT\u2014 On Mean Ruz, the north-eastern extreme of Ploumanac'h point, at 69 feet above high water, is exhibited from a square lighthouse, 36 feet high, a fixed red light, visible 5 miles. Semaphore. \u2014 There is also a Semaphore station on Ploumanac'h point, and westward of the point is the little tidal harbour of Ploumanac'h ; see page 12. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Ploumanac'h at 5h. 15m. ; springs rise 24J feet, neaps 18^ feet above the soundings. ANSE de PERROS.\u2014 Depths.\u2014 This bay, 1% miles wide at the entrance, is 2\\ miles south-eastward from Mean Ruz ; it affords good shelter from westerly winds to vessels that can take the ground. Those of light draught may lie afloat in the outer part of the bay, between which and the port at its head, which is almost dry at neaps, and has only 7 or 8 feet at high water springs, the beaching places, on a bottom of muddy sand about 9^ feet above the lowest tides, are excellent. Tome, a narrow islet nearly a mile in length N. by E. and S. by W., is one mile north-eastward from the western point of the bay ; its outer rocks, the Couillons de Tome, N.N.W. 7 or 8 cables from the northern end of the islet, are marked on their western sides bjT a red spindle buoy. The highest part of the islet is about a third of its length from the northern end. The little town of Perros-Guirec has about 2,800 inhabitants ; its port is protected on the east byT the Lenquin jetty 165 yards in length, a great portion of which is available as a quay, the total quay frontage of the port being no less than 515 yards. There is little or no trade, the harbour being used chiefly as a refuge for coasters, which frequently run from the outer roadstead for shelter at high water, springs, but in so doing run the risk of being neaped. LIGHTS. \u2014 At Nantouar, in Perros bay, two fixed white lights are exhibited ; that close to the shore, near Nantouar bridge, is 33 feet above high water, and visible 10 miles ; the inner light, at Kerjean, S. 20\u00b0 E., 750 yards from the former, is 253 feet above high water and visible 14 miles. Nantouar light is attached to a white house ; Kerjean lighthouse is a white tower near a farm-house. The two lighthouses in line by day, or the lights by night, lead into Perros bay through the north-western passage. See chart, No. 2,644.;"], [79, "Chap. II.] ANSE DE PERROS. \u2014 LIGHTS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 51 Two fixed white lights are also exhibited at the port of Perros, viz., the Colombier light, shown from a house at 110 yards behind the Colombier day-mark, 89 feet above high water, visible 14 miles ; and, an inner light, from a gibbet on a house, at Kerprigent, S. 59\u00b0 W. 3,133 yards from the other, 259 feet above high water, also visible 14 miles. The two lighthouses in line by day, or the lights by night, lead into the bay through the eastern channel. None of these lights are visible more than 18\u00b0 on either side of the direction they are intended to indicate. The Colombier day-mark is a white tower serving as a beacon and visible many miles seaward. A Life-Boat is stationed at Perros. Directions.\u2014 Coming from the westward in-shore, Rougic ile hidden by the ile de Bono, Sept-iles, leads between the Triagoz and all the shoals northward and eastward of ile Grande ; and, when the southern end of ile Tome is open of Mean Ruz, a course of about E. | S. leads between the Sept-iles and the northern end of ile Tome, bearing in mind that the tidal stream sometimes sets through this channel at the rate of 5 knots. If desirous of entering Perros bay from the north-westward, steer in for the southern end of Tome until Nantouar and Kerjean lighthouses are in line ; with this mark on, pass westward of two pointed rocks named the Bilzic, marked by a black beacon turret, which lie nearly a mile off its western side and uncover 22 and 32 feet, and eastward of the Fronde rock, marked by a red spherical buoy, and of the red beacon turret on Bernard rock, about 2 cables from the western point of the bay. Four patches, of which the highest is awash at low water, lie between this latter rock and the Pierre du Chenal, marked by a beacon turret painted with red and white bands ; therefore, at low water, do not proceed farther southward than to have Perros church opening southward of the hill on the western point of the bay. But, if proceeding to the port of Perros-Guirec, with a proper rise of tide, be careful to haul to the westward in good time to bring the Kerprigent and Colombier lighthouses in line, which mark leads up to the port ; and great care is necessary, for a vessel overrunning this line will be upon the rocks. Bound into Perros bay from the eastward, through the north eastern channel, which has as little as 3 feet water at one part at lowest equinoctial springs, pass north-westward of the black conical See chart, No. 2,644."], [80, "USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE.

As soon as the Colombier and Kerprigent lighthouses are seen, bring them in line and steer for them. This leading mark clears all the reefs ex tending from the mainland, including the Crebineyers, marked by a black buoy ; it also passes very close on the starboard hand the Pierre Jean Rousic, off the southern end of ile Tome, which un covers one foot, and the Pierre du Chenal beacon turret, which bears about S.W. | S. 5 cables from the southern end of ile Tome and which rock uncovers 14 feet. After passing close southward of this beacon turret, the vessel may anchor about 1| cables south-westward of it, in from 11 to 14 feet water ; or, with a proper rise of tide, the same mark will lead her on past the black beacon turrets on the Roc'h Hu and Barr Goalenou on the port hand, and the red beacon of Craou on the starboard hand ; and, after passing the latter, she may haul up for the pier-head and enter the port. By night. \u2014 Nantouar and Kerjean lights in line lead through the western passage into Perros bay ; Colombier and Kerprigent lights in line, through the eastern passage. Vessels entering by the western channel should observe the caution already given and leave the line of the two former lights in one, the moment the Colombier and Kerprigent lights come in sight, to avoid overrunning their line of direction. PORT BLANC. \u2014 From Perros bay to point du Chateau, the western point of entrance to the river Treguier, the coast trends East 9 miles and is fronted by innumerable rocks both above and below water, extending from 1^ to 2 miles off-shore. About midway is a little inlet with from 3 to 2\\ fathoms named port Blanc, with Chateau Neuf isle and the Four ledge on the western side of its entrance, and Leverette and St. Gildas isles on the eastern side. The port is well sheltered and affords safe refuge for coasters during south-westerly gales but is open to winds from N.W. round by North to N.E., and vessels caught by such winds frequently run ashore under the lee of St. Gildas isle on a soft weedy bottom. With the wind eastward of N.E. the anchorage is considered preferable to that in Perros bay.

Depths. \u2014 A vessel will not have less than 22 feet by anchoring north-westward of the Louet, a large rock on the eastern side of the port, but better shelter in less water may be found farther in. If she can take the ground, good beaching places may be found East and E.S.E. of the Voleur, where the bottom is 10^ feet above the level of the lowest tides. Semaphore. \u2014 -There is a Semaphore station at port Blanc; see page 12. TREGUIER or JAUDY RIVER, the entrance to which is 9 miles in an E.S.E. direction from the north-eastern ledge of the Sept-iles plateau, and 3^ miles westward of Heaux light house, fully described at page 57, affords good shelter but is difficult of access to sailing vessels, and with gales from N.N.W. to E.N.E., a heavy sea runs at the entrance on the ebb. Depths. \u2014 The entrance, otherwise deep, is crossed by a bar with only 3 feet water between ile d'Er and Corne rock, which bar has over it at high water, springs, 29 feet, and at neaps 24 feet, The general depths, when within, are from 5 fathoms near the entrance to 2 fathoms near Treguier ; to which depths must be added for high water, a rise of 25 feet at springs, and 18^ feet at neaps. From the entrance nearly up to the little town of Treguier, a distance of 6 miles, the channel is generally over 300 yards wide ; near the town it narrows, and at one place is only 50 or 60 yards wide. The town has about 3,500 inhabitants, has good quays with soft mud berths alongside, but being 16 miles from the nearest railway, has little or no trade. The river is spanned by a suspension bridge at Treguier. The three channels leading to the river entrance are, the Grande Passe, Passe du N.E., and Passe de la Gaine. They are all well buoyed and beaconed on the French uniform system ; see page 14. Grande Passe leads to the entrance from the north-westward and is practicable for vessels of any draught at high water. For this channel, keep St. Antoine mill exactly on with the mill of Port de la Chaine, or, the white lighthouses of la Chaine and St. Antoine in one S.S.E. \\ E. easterly, and the vessel will pass about 3 cables westward of the black conical buoy marking the Crublent shoal and the same distance eastward of the Renauds rocks, which See chart, No. 2,669 *."], [82, "[Chap. II. 54 USHANT TO HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. never cover, and over a patch of 22 feet, which, with the leading mark on, is the least depth in this channel ; she will also pass about a cable eastward of Pierre a l'Anglais rock which uncovers 8 feet, and still closer to the red spherical buoy marking the Petit-pen-ar- Guezec shoal, the highest heads of which dry 3 feet ; and, 2 cables westward of the black beacon on the Corbeau rock, which uncovers 19 feet. By night, the red and white lights in line S.S.E. easterly lead through the Grande Passe. Passe du N.E. \u2014 The large spire of Treguier cathedral exactly on with the white tower on the Skeiviec rock, which tower is 30 feet above the level of high water, bearing S.W. southerly, leads to the entrance of the river ; but, this line crosses the Jument ledge, the western extreme of which lies N.W. by W. nearly 2 miles from Heaux lighthouse and is marked by a red conical bell-buoy moored off its northern edge ; the leading mark must therefore be left, both on entering and leaving the river, to pass westward of the ledge and buoy. Vessels not drawing more than 17 feet, having rounded the western end of the Jument, may, with this leading mark on, cross the Basses de Roc'h Hir after half flood, or if the Petit Roc'h Hir is covered. This rock lies on the north-eastern part of the ledge and uncovers 13 feet. This channel should only be used with smooth water. Passe de la Gaine, the most easterly channel, is practicable with smooth water for vessels of 14 feet draught after 3^ hours' flood, and is useful when approaching from the eastward if there is sufficient wind to stem the tide. The entrance is between the Heaux and Sark rocks ; the leading mark is, the white beacon wall in the south-eastern part of the village of Plougrescan on with the white pyramid of Men-Noblance, on the southern part of ile d'Er, bearing W. by S. This leads a vessel nearly half a mile southward of Heaux lighthouse and over the Pont de la Gaine, a narrow cut in the ledge extending from the southern end of the Duono rocks, with only one foot water at the lowest tides. LIGHTS. \u2014 Three lights are exhibited at the entrance of the Treguier river. La Chaine. \u2014 Near the harbour mill of port de la Chaine is a fixed white light, visible 9 miles, 36 feet above high water, exhibited from the keeper's house, which is white. See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [83, "Chap. II.] TREGUIER RIVER.-CHANNELS.-LIC1HTS.-DIRECTI0NS. 55 St. Antoine. \u2014 Near St. Antoine mill is a fixed red light 105 feet above high water, also shown from the keeper's house, and visible through an arc of 16\u00b0 on each side of the leading line for a distance of 9 miles ; the red light is distant three quarters of a mile S.S.E. -} E. easterly from the white light, and, when in line, they lead through the Grande Passe. Corne rock. \u2014 From a lighthouse on the Come rock, on the eastern side of the entrance, is exhibited a fixed light, 38 feet above high water, showing sectors of green, red, and ivhite, as follows : \u2014 green on a W.S.W. bearing, through an angle of 1\\\u00b0, or between the Petit Pen-ar-Guezec and the shoal of port Beni ; red eastward of the green sector ; and ivhite on an E.N.E. bearing, through an angle of 1\\\u00b0. The green light is visible only 4 miles, the red 5 miles, and the white 9 miles ; but the light is unwatched and therefore cannot be implicitly relied on. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on Creach-ar-Maout hill nearly a mile N. 77\u00b0 E. from port de la Chaine lights ; see page 12. Life-Boat, &C. \u2014 A life-boat and mortar apparatus with other life-saving a'ppliances are stationed at port de la Chaine. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots of Treguier seldom cruise off the port, it being difficult for their small boats to keep or get to sea with on-shore winds. In such a case, a vessel from the westward would do well to secure a pilot at Ploumanac'h ; or, if from the eastward, at ile de Brehat. Anchorages. \u2014 From abreast of the Skeiviec rock, H miles within the entrance, to the town of Treguier, the river is deep enough* for coasters always to remain afloat. It has three anchorages, well sheltered from wind and tide, of which the best and most convenient is the Palamos anchorage, about 2 miles within the Skeiviec, where the depths are from 2\\ to 4 fathoms. Directions. \u2014 In steering through either of the channels for the entrance of the river, keep the leading mark on until the large spire of Treguier cathedral is on with the white tower on Skeiviec See chart.

This latter mark leads into the river, but, before running in, make sure that the tide is sufficiently high for the vessel to pass over an 8-feet patch, a cable outside the ledge bordering the eastern side of ile d'Er, and also over the Pie bank on which there are only 6 feet at low water, springs. After passing between the beacon on the Taureau and the Corne rock, which rocks are about 1\u00a3 miles within the Petit Pen-ar-Guezec buoy (and, between them, the channel is not more than 150 yards wide), and southward of the Taureau bank red buoy steer up the river keeping midway between the rocks bordering its banks. At night, vessels entering the Treguier river should steer with la Chaine white light on with St. Antoine red light bearing S.S.E. \\ E. easterly until la Corne green light is seen, then steer for it, keeping within the green sector. Pass a short distance westward of the Corne rock and anchor within the white sector of light, which marks the inner anchorage. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the Treguier river at 5h. 22m. ; equinoctial springs rise about 35 feet, ordinary springs 26 feet, and neaps 21 feet above the soundings. Off the town of Treguier, it is high water at 5h. 32m. : springs rise 25 feet, neaps 18^ feet, neaps range 12 feet. The flood stream, which sets into this river, rounds the northern shore of ile d'Er until the bank connecting this isle with the main is covered, which takes place at about half flood ; it then slackens at the entrance of the river and runs eastward. The rate of the flood within the river is never more than 3 knots ; that of the ebb rather less. See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [85, "57 CHAPTER III. HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. VARIATION in 1897.-17\u00b0 10' W. PLATEAU des HEAUX,* composed of rocks, of which many are always above water, is about one mile in extent E.S.E. and W.N.W. and 7 or 8 cables wide. At its north-eastern edge is the rock Men-Lem, which never covers, and can be passed on its north eastern side at 250 yards distance ; at 6^ cables eastward and south eastward from the lighthouse are small sunken rocks with only 2 and 2\\ fathoms water ; on the south-eastern edge is the rock Roc'h-ar-Hanap, which never covers, and can be passed on its southern side within half a cable. LIGHT. \u2014 Heaux lighthouse is a round tower, 159 feet high from base to vane, erected on the eastern part of the plateau des Heaux ; from it, Sept-iles lighthouse bears W. by N. 1G\\ miles ; Roches-Douvres lighthouse N.E. by E. \\ E. 15f miles ; and the light house on Grand Lejon rock S.E. southerly 19\u00a3 miles.

The intervening space of 23\u00b0 between the two red sectors, through which the fixed ivhite light is visible, is free from danger, except the Roc'h-ar-Bel shoal with 20 feet water, 3 cables westward of which is the Carec-Mingui with only 11 feet at low water, springs. Vessels in the offing, with the white sector of light in sight, are clear of danger in the channel between Barnouic and Horaine ledges. Ypproaching from the eastward, having passed well northward ot Horaine ledge, and having crossed the line of the leading lights of Bodic heights and Croix rock, Trieux channel, in line, a north westerly course may be steered, and the flashing red sector of light entered. THE COAST.\u2014 Baie de Saint Brieuc\u2014 Between the plateau des Heaux and ile de Brehat is the north-eastern entrance to the Trieux river, and on the opposite side of the ile is its eastern entrance. Between ile de Brehat and cape Frehel, distant 28^ miles on a S.E. h E. bearing, the coast line falls back, forming the deep bight named the Baie de Saint Brieuc. The approach to the western entrance of the bay is indicated at night by the fixed white light on the plateau des Heaux, and in the day by Creach-ar-Maout hill, about 3 miles S.S.W. from the light, This hill forms the abrupt termination northward of the high land separating the river Trieux from the Treguier ; on its summit is a guard-house with the Sema phore before described close to it. The bay is on all sides much encumbered by rocks and shoals both in-shore and in the offing. The land is generally high and may be seen in clear weather about 22 miles distant. In very clear weather, the summits of the central chain of Bretagne hills are visible, and amongst others the Mener-Bel-Air and the Mener-Bre ; the former rises southward, and the latter south-westward of the bay. When bound westward from cape Frehel, the parts first seen are cape d'Erqui and Bien-Assis wood on the eastern side, and then Plouha point and the small town of Plouzec on the western side of the bay. The Rade de Brehat, with the ports of Trieux, Paimpol, Portrieux, and Binic, are on the western side of the bay ; in the southern part is port Legue and the town of Saint Brieuc, with the large shallow See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [87, "Chap.

The Verdelet, a conical-shaped islet, lies 2 cables north-westward of Pleneuf point, between which point, and cape d'Erqui the shore is generally low and exposed to the North-west, but the rade d'Erqui affords good shelter with easterly winds. The hills, at this part, rise suddenly a short distance within high-water mark and unite with the high lands in the interior ; Bien-Assis wood, on their summit, may be recognised at a great distance. Cape d'Erqui is a lofty promontory terminating in a steep slope on its western face ; between it and cape Frehel, 7\u00a3 miles eastward, the shore is composed of high rocky cliffs, with the exception of a small sandy beach under the village of Pleherel. The little inlet, Bouche d'Erqui, lies 3 miles eastward of the cape of that name. CAUTION. \u2014 As all dangers between ile de Brehat and cape Frehel rise from soundings of less than 18 fathoms, the prudent seaman will at night or in thick weather keep without that depth. The off-lying dangers, Basse Maurice, plateau de Barnouic, and plateau des Roches-Douvres, are not included in this caution, they being surrounded by much deeper water. PLATEAU des ROCHES-DOUVRES. \u2014 This dangerous rocky ledge, the outermost of the off-lying dangers fronting St. Brieuc bay, occupies a space 3^ miles long N.N.W. and S.S.E. and 2h miles wide ; from it rises a group of 12 rocky heads which never cover. The highest head of the plateau is about 9 feet above the highest tides, and is in the middle of the group ; on it stands a white iron lighthouse. The north-western edge of the ledge bears N.E. | E., and the south-eastern edge E.N.E. northerly about 15^ miles from Heaux lighthouse. For tidal Streams in this vicinity, see Table on following page, and also general description at page 224.

PLATEAU de BARNOUIC\u2014 About 12| miles E. by N. \\ N. from Heaux lighthouse, and N.E. \\ N. 8|- miles from the Horaine rock, are the Gautier rocks, near the middle of the Plateau de Barnouic , a dangerous rocky ledge, of which the southern edge lies E. f N. from Heaux lighthouse. The Gautier rocks uncover 14 feet at the lowest tides, and are awash at low water, neaps. The Barnouic rock, of conical form, bears E. \\ N. about 7\u00a3 cables from the Gautier rocks ; it uncovers 2'&\\ feet, covers 2\\ hours before high water, springs, and is awash at high water, neaps. This plateau, of which the Barnouic and Gautier are the highest rocks, extends from the Barnouic rock about one mile eastward, about 1\\ miles S.S.W., 2\\ miles N.W. by W., and 2 miles N.N.W. The most westerly rocky patches, one of which has only 3 feet water, bear N.E. by E. f E. 11^ miles from Heaux lighthouse. There are from 10 to 15 fathoms on parts of the plateau, but the sea at times breaks over its whole extent. The Roches-Douvres and Barnouic ledge are separated by a channel more than 2 miles wide, carrying a depth of from 20 to 30 fathoms. It should, however, be avoided by sailing vessels, as the streams set with great strength over both ledges. If forced to pass through it, endeavour to keep nearer the Douvres than the Barnouic. A vessel will keep westward of both ledges by not bringing Heaux lighthouse more westerly than S.W. \\ W. Basse Maurice is a small rocky patch in the channel between the Plateau de Barnouic and the shore ; from its shoalest spot of 7 fathoms, Heaux lighthouse bears W. \u00a7 S. southerly nearly 7 miles ; Paon lighthouse, ile de Brehat, S.W. | S. 6 miles ; the guard-house on Creach-ar-Maout hill is on with the Louet rock beacon W.S.W. ; and, See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [90, "62 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL.

Although the depth is never less than 7 fathoms on this shoal, it should be avoided in bad weather, as a heavy sea runs over it during a weather tide. Roc'h.-ar-Bel.\u2014 This shoal patch of 20 feet lies at the north-eastern extreme of the great rocky flat extending 5 miles from the shore which separates the entrances of the rivers Trieux and Treguier, and of which the Heaux rocks form a part. From it, Heaux lighthouse bears W. \u00a3 N. 3^ miles ; and, the guard-house on Creach-ar-Maout hill is on with the Sark rocks. Carec-Mingui, a rocky patch of 11 feet, lies 3 cables westward of the Roc'h-ar-Bel. Heaux lighthouse bearing W. \u00a3 S. leads southward of the Basse Maurice, and northward of the Carec-Mingui and Roc'h-ar-Bel shoals, over which shoals the tide, at springs, sets with a velocity of 5 knots. Extensive rocky ledges, lying in a general easterly and westerly direction, extend 5 or 6 miles eastward and south-eastward of ile de Brehat, and on them several rocky heads dry at low water. The northernmost ledges are the Horaine and Echaudes ; the southern most, Men-Marc'h and Ringue-bras ; between them are navigable channels leading to Brehat road. Outside of the rocky limits, and 5i miles from the nearest land, pointe de Plouzec, numerous banks of sand, under the general name of Banes de Sable, extend 4\u00a3 miles in a S. by E. direction from their northern end, near the eastern extreme of the plateau de Men-Marc'h ; on some of these banks the depth is as little as 2\\ fathoms. PLATEAU de LA HORAINE.\u2014 Refuge beacon.\u2014 This rocky ledge is 1J miles in extent, N.E. and S.W., and one mile wide ; it has many rocky heads awash and nearly awash at low water, and one head, the Horaine rock, on which is a refuge beacon, about a mile within the northern extreme the ledge, bearing S.E. by E. | E. 6\u00a7 miles from Heaux lighthouse and E. by N.

From the rock, the white pyramid on Ar-Morbic rock is a little open westward of St. Michel chapel, ile de Brehat ; Ste. Barbe windmill is midway between two of the highest peaks of St. Riom isle ; and, Paon point and Rosedo lights, ile de Brehat, are in line bearing W. by S. \\ S. Basses du Nord are the most northern patches on the plateau de la Horaine. The shoalest spot, 10 feet, lies N.E. | E. 8 cables from the Horaine rock ; Basse du Nord-Est, with 9 feet water, bears East 7^ cables from the Horaine rock ; and Basse du Sud-Est, with only 8 feet, lies 1^ miles S.E. by E. \\ E. from the Horaine rock. From this latter patch, the Horaine beacon is on with Heaux light house N.W. by W. | W. There is a channel 5 cables wide, with from 10 to 12 fathoms between this Basse and the Horaine ledges. Bell-buoy. \u2014 A large red conical bell-buoy is moored at the north eastern edge of the plateau de la Horaine, 1^ miles from the Horaine rock. PLATEAU des ECHAUDES lies south-westward of the Horaine, and its highest rock, the Echaudes, uncovers 8^ feet at low water, springs. This rock is near the southern part of the ledge and, from it, the guard-house on Creach-ar-Maout hill is on with the northern extreme of ile de Brehat W.N.W. northerly ; the white pjramid on Louet rock is on with the southern fall of the hillock on which St. Michel chapel stands ; and, Ste. Barbe mill is a little open eastward of the summit of St. Riom isle S.W. \u00a3 S. Another rock, the Pain de Bray, uncovers only 2 feet.

III. 64 PLATEAU de MEN-MARCH.\u2014 Bell-buoy.\u2014 This plateau is south-eastward of the Horaine and Echaudes reefs ; and, between them is a channel leading to Brehat road. It is 3 miles long E. by N. | N. and W. by S. \\ S., and 1J miles broad at its widest part ; the only rocky head visible at the lowest tides is the Men- Marc'h in the south-eastern part, which then uncovers 2 feet, and is at all times dangerous on account of the eddies in its vicinity. Numerous shoal patches of from 2 feet, near the western edge, to 1|- and 3| fathoms at the north-western part of the ledge, lie west ward and northward of this rock. A red conical bell-buoy is moored off the north-eastern end of the plateau in about 10 fathoms. PLATEAU du RINGUE-BRAS is the next ledge southward of the Men-Marc'h, and between them is a channel leading to Brehat road ; it is 3 miles long East and West, and about a mile wide at its broadest part towards the eastern end. The Basse de l'Ascension, the highest head on this ledge, is near its eastern extreme, and has only from 3 to 6 feet over it at the lowest tides. Directions. \u2014 Vessels from the westward bound to any of the ports in St. Brieuc bay, or to St. Malo or Granville, generally pass between Barnouic and Horaine ledges. This channel is 7 miles wide, the tidal streams follow its direction, and, as before stated, the Basse Maurice, the only rocky patch in the channel, need be avoided in bad weather only. A vessel using this channel should steer to pass within 4 miles of Heaux lighthouse, and as it is approached keep it well southward of S.E. to avoid the dangers westward of it. When eastward of its meridian, it should not be brought westward of W, \\ S. until the guard-house on Creach-ar-Maout hill is on with the Sark rocks S.W. by W. | W. The vessel is then eastward of the Roc'h-ar-Bel, and the lighthouse may be brought to bear W. f N., on which bearing it leads between the Basse Maurice and the red bell-buoy of the Horaine. From the south-eastward, a vessel is in the fairway of this channel when Heaux lighthouse bears W. | N., and it is necessary to have it on this bearing before she is abreast of the plateau de la Horaine, which position will be ensured by not crossing the line of Ste. Barbe mill on with the highest part of the crest of St. Riom isle bearing about S.W. until the old mill on ile de Brehat, without sails, a red roof, and a broad white band below the roof, is quite open westward of the white pyramid on Ar-Morbic rock, or until the See chart, No. 2,669 *."], [93, "Chap. III.] SHOALS. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 TRIEUX RIVER. 65 Heaux rocks appear quite open northward of the Sark rocks. To avoid the Roc'h-ar-Bel, Heaux lighthouse must he brought to bear W. S. Having passed westward of the meridian of Heaux light house, and until 5 or 6 miles from it, keep it well southward of S.E. to avoid all dangers westward of it. Tidal Streams. \u2014 Between the plateau de Barnouic and Basse Maurice the flood stream sets S.E. by S., and ceases about an hour after high water by the shore at ile de Brehat ; its greatest velocity, about 4| knots, is at about half flood. The ebb runs in the opposite direction, and ceases about an hour after low water by the shore ; its strength is nearly equal to that of the flood. At a mile north ward of Heaux lighthouse, the flood sets S.E. by E., the ebb N.W. by W., with about the same strength. Close to the edge of the rocks it is somewhat stronger, running at the rate of 5 knots past the Heaux, over the Roc'h-ar-Bel, and both round and over the north eastern edge of the Horaine. The whirls and eddies occasionally met with in the channel between the Horaine and Barnouic ledges, are strong but not dangerous ; the most considerable is produced by the Basse Maurice. TRIEUX RIVER. \u2014 Four channels lead into this river, which is tidal as far as Pontrieux, 16 miles above Paon point lighthouse ; one only, the Grand Chenal or Trieux channel, is available for large ships at all times by day or night, and neither of the others should be attempted without the aid of a pilot. The Trieux channel is the northern entrance between the Roc'h ar-Bel and Horaine ledges. Small vessels may enter from the westward at any time of tide, by day, through the Moisie and Men-du-Castrec channels ; and, from the eastward, through the Ferlas channel, which latter is practicable for vessels of deep draught from half flood to half ebb, but can be used only by coasters at low water, springs. Depths. \u2014 The least depth in the main channel of the river as high as the suspension bridge above Lezardrieux is, at the lowest tides, 4 fathoms ; at high water, springs, 9 fathoms ; and at neaps, 1\\ fathoms. Above the bridge the depths are considerable and the river navigable for small craft as far as Pontrieux, where it is dammed. Everywhere within the entrance above the anchorages, however, the channel is extremely narrow and tortuous. Buoyage. \u2014 The several entrance channels are all well buoyed and beaconed in accordance with the French uniform system.

Anchorages.\u2014 Several anchorages in the entrance of this river afford refuge to vessels of deep draught, but they are difficult of access, especially on the ebb. As the holding-ground is bad and the stream rapid, in the middle of the river, ships should anchor as near the edge of the mud-banks as possible on either side. Pomelin road is on the northern side of the river, about 2\\ miles within Paon light, and the marks for the best anchorage, in 30 feet and out of the tide, are, the old mill on Brehat just open northward of the ruins on ile Verte ; and, the new mill of Loguivi seen between point du Gouern and Conan rock. A vessel should moor North and South in Pomelin road. There is also anchorage north-eastward of this, near the outer edge of the mud-banks which uncover as far southward as the line of Croix rock lighthouse on with Loguivi mill ; vessels should moor here W.N.W. and E.S.E. Another good and well sheltered anchorage in which the streams have not much strength, and with sufficient room and depth for large ships, is near the edge of the mud-banks south-eastward of the ile de Bois, a high steep island close to the western point of entrance to the river, on which stands a guard-house. The anchoring ground here extends in a south-westerly direction from the line of the beacon turret on Vieille de Loguivi rock on with Arcouest mill ; anchor in 7^ fathoms with the two lighthouses at Coat-Mer in line ; and, Loguivi guard-house between the two mills, rather nearer the old mill than the new ; moor here also W.N.W. and E.S.E. The first anchorage within the river for a vessel of deep draught is near the right bank with Coat-Mer lighthouses in line, and north westward of a large rock named Melus, which lies fronting the Douane or Custom-house office on the Roc'h-ar-On ; a large vessel should not venture beyond this at night, but should anchor the moment Heaux light is shut in by ile de Bois. There is room for two moderate sized vessels between Bodic light tower and Sabot-du- Sud rock ; also, excellent holding-ground on both sides of the river out of the strength of the stream southward of Coat-Mer cove, and south-westward of a water-mill abreast of the cove. Lezardrieux, a little port on the left or western bank, on the opposite side to the deep channel of the river nearly 2\\ miles above the Custom-house office on the Roc'h-ar-On, is full of rocks and dries at low water of all tides, though it has as much as 30 feet in the entrance at high water, springs, and 20 feet at neaps.

Vessels of 6 to 8 feet draught can generally remain afloat between this port and a rocky ledge on the western side of the deep channel. Those bound up to Pontrieux, anchor here to wait for sufficient water when they arrive during neaps ; or, during springs, to await the aid of a local pilot, without whomno vessel should attempt the difficult passages in the river between here and Pontrieux. The first of these passages named Ar-Toul-Tane, is at a sudden turn in the river, 4 cables above Lezardrieux suspension bridge, which bridge spans the river 108 feet above the lowest tides. The second passage is in the turn of the river under the high land and chateau of Roche- Jugut, one mile above which on its eastern side the Trieux receives the waters of the little river Left'. Pontrieux. \u2014 The little port of Pontrieux is on the right bank of the river, about half a mile below the town of that name, and 8 miles above Lezardrieux bridge. It has about 400 yards of quay frontage, all on the eastern side ; the berths at the foot of the quay dry about 22^ feet above the level of the lowest tides. The town is built on both sides of the river and has a population of about 2,500. Its trade is insignificant, and is carried on chiefly by coasters of from 30 to 100 tons, though it is possible for vessels of 300 tons to ascend as high as Pontrieux. The railway station at Guincamp, on the Paris and Brest line, is about 10 miles distant. LIGHTS. \u2014 On Paon point, at the north-eastern end of ile de Brehat, from a square lighthouse, is exhibited at 67 feet above high water, a fixed light, showing white through an arc of 8\u00b0, between N.N.W. \\ W. and N.W. by N. ; also white through an arc of 45\u00b0, between N.E. \\ E. and E.

The red beacon turret on the Moguedhier is about 1^ cables N.N.W. from the Croix lighthouse. Having arrived at a position 3 or 4 cables north-eastward of the Croix lighthouse, or before the vessel is abreast of the Moguedhier beacon turret, haul a little to starboard lo pass a safe distance west ward of the Croix lighthouse ; after which, bring the keeper's house on Coat-Mer peninsula on with the square white tower of the inner light, which leads to the inner anchorage between ile de Bois and Coat-Mer. By Night, enter the river with Croix and Bodic lights in line. and when Bodic light is hidden by Croix light-tower, as it will be to an eye 8 feet above the sea, when it is 1,800 yards distant, open out Bodic light westward of Croix light and pass the latter on its western side. Afterwards, proceed with the two inner fixed red lights in line to the anchorage of Coat-Mer. Moisie channel commences at the Moisie red beacon turret near the Sark rocks, and joins the Trieux channel near the red turret marking the Vieille du Treou. The flood stream, at springs, sets through at 4-^ or 5 knots in the direction of the channel until near the rock Noguejou-bian, on which is a red beacon, when it inclines south-westward towards ile St. Mode. The ebb is not quite so strong and takes more the direction of the channel as the tide falls. The leading mark is, the spire of St. Michel chapel, ile de Brehat, on with Rosedo white beacon tower S. 3\u00b0 E. The channel is very narrow, but is convenient for vessels of moderate length and draught entering the river Trieux with a scant wind. Men-du-Castrec Channel has its entrance between the shoals Ar-Mesclek on the West and Men-du-Castrec on the East, and joins the Trieux channel at the same point as the Moisie. The tidal streams run at the rate of 4\u00a3 or 5 knots but follow the direction of the channel. The leading mark, the white pyramid on Arcouest point on with the red beacon turret of Vieille du Treou, leads through in mid-channel until near the latter, but over the eastern head of the shoal Ar-Gazec on which there are only 6 feet at low water, springs.

Ferlas Channel. \u2014 This channel is available by day for vessels of 8 feet draught at low water, springs ; for vessels of 13 feet draught at low water, neaps ; and, for vessels of any draught at high water. To run from Brehat road into Trieux river through this channel, with the best water, weigh when the rock at the south-western point of Logodec islet has just covered ; it uncovers 22 feet at the lowest tides. Steer westward to pass midway between the black and white beacon turret on the Piliers and the red and white turret on the Vis-Argent rocks, and towards the Rompa red and black beacon turret, passing half a cable northward of the summits of Rouray, Conan, and Levret rocks, which latter border the southern side of the channel and never cover ; and southward of the Rout-ar-Linen red beacon, of the Trebeyou red turret, and of the Rompa beacon turret, which latter, however, may be passed on either side at half a cable ; after passing it, bring it and the Piliers beacon turret in line, and this mark leads into the Trieux channel, southward of the Tranquet rock and of the Vieille de Loguivi red and white beacon turret, and up to the direction of the two lighthouses of Coat-Mer in line. There is a passage connecting the Ferlas and Trieux channels east ward of the Tranquet and of the beacon on the Trou-blanc, named the Trou-blanc channel.

Tidal Streams. \u2014 The tidal streams off the entrance of the Trieux river have been already noticed at page 65. Within the entrance, between St. Mode isle and La Croix lighthouse, they follow the direction of the channel ; but, outside or north-eastward of Saint- Mode, they cross the channel with great strength, and it requires a fresh fair wind to keep the leading mark on. For time and rise of tides at the entrance of the Trieux river, see tides around ile de Brehat, page 77. ILE de BREHAT.\u2014 The south-western point of this isle is less than a mile from Arcouest point on the mainland, and it extends from thence 2 miles in a N.E. by N. direction to Paon point, but is nearly divided into two about its centre. The most conspicuous objects on it are, the lighthouses on Paon point and on the little mound of Rosedo, St. Michel chapel, the northern mill, the southern mill (le Vieux Moulin) which has no sails, a red roof, and a white band 9 feet wide below the roof. The most remarkable irregularities of outline are at Paon point, at the small hill where the chapel stands, and at the hillocks crowning both points of entrance to port Clos. The isle appears distinct from the coast on a South, S.W., or North bearing, but, unless very near, it becomes blended with the land when bearing between W.S.W. and N.W. The white pyramids placed on the Ar-Morbic, Louet, and Quistillic rocks, which front the eastern part of the isle, are also conspicuous Objects and may be seen at some distance. lie de Brehat has a population of over 1,000, mostly hardy fisher men and sailors, and it has three small ports, viz., Port de la Corderie on its north-western side, port Clos on its south-western side, and port la Chambre on its south-eastern side ; the first is entered from the Trieux channel, the last two from the rade de Brehat. The dangers already described surrounding this isle seaward are comprised between the lines of Heaux lighthouse bearing West, and the mill on the high land a little northward of Pomelin bay on with the south-western point of ile de Brehat N.W. by W.

Semaphore.\u2014 There is a Semaphore station on ile de Brehat on the highest part of the island, about 260 yards southward of the lighthouse on Rosedo hill ; see page 12. A Life-Boat is stationed at Paon point, ile de Brehat. Port de la Corderie, on the north-western side of ile de Brehat is a grounding place where vessels of moderate draught find shelter, and at this little port is the government store of buoys, moorings, &c. its entrance, on the eastern side of the Kerpont channel, is only half a cable wide and open to the westward ; it is southward of the large rock Kervarec, 150 yards south-eastward of which is a rocky ledge marked by two black beacons. Only 100 yards southward of these is a red beacon marking the extreme of the rocks on the southern side. Depths. \u2014 Three mooring buoys lie in mid-channel to assist vessels in taking up their berths. At the outer buoy the harbour dries 5 feet at low water, springs, and there are from 26 feet at high water, springs, to 18^ feet at neaps. At the middle buoy there are 3 feet less water, and at the inner buoy 4 feet less than at the outer buoy. Vessels he aground on a bottom of mud and sand from the entrance to the head of the port. The best berth for vessels of about 15 feet draught is 2 cables within the entrance. Small coasters lie eastward of this position, and sometimes in the middle of the little cove at the head of the port, where there are from 5 to 6 feet less water than in the channel. Port Clos, on the southern side of ile de Brehat between the southern entrances of Kerpont channel and Brehat road, dries through out at low water, and although difficult of access, affords refuge to coasting vessels capable of taking the ground, having within the causeway described 20 feet at high water, springs, and 12 feet at neaps. Three rocks, in a straight line N.E. and S.W., divide the entrance of this port in two parts. The most southern, named Men-Allen, is near low-water mark and uncovers about 19 feet ; the second is about half a cable farther in, and also uncovers 19 feet ; the third is about a cable northward of the second and uncovers 26 feet.

The bottom at the foot of the causeway dries 1-| feet at the lowest tides ; the best berth is half a cable N.N.E. of the rock at the end of the causeway, where the bottom dries nearly 11 feet. Most vessels, however, lie outside the causeway, about half a cable S.S.E. of the rock ; the grounding places here are good, but anchors have but little hold, and at high water it is exposed to winds from between W.S.W. and S.S.E. Port la Chambre. \u2014 If surprised in Brehat road by strong easterly winds, a vessel that can take the ground will find good shelter in port la Chambre, between the south-eastern part of ile de Brehat and Logodec and Lavrec islets. It dries at low water, and its principal entrance, about 100 yards wide, is between the rocks at the south-eastern point of the isle, and those adjacent to the western side of Logodec. A vessel cannot proceed farther into this port than the large islet lying abreast of the northern end of Logodec, which divides the channel into two branches. The best berth is about 150 yards southward of that islet, where the bottom dries about 9 feet, and where there are 22 feet at high water, springs, and 14 feet at neaps. A clump of trees surrounding Ste. Barbe chapel bearing about S.S.W., and touching the eastern side of a large rock named the Chateau, just westward of ile Blanche de l'Arcouest leads to the entrance. Rade de Brehat, on the southern side of ile de Brehat, is the only place between Heaux lighthouse and cape Frehel in which vessels of moderate draught can find shelter during strong winds from N.N.E. to N.N.W.

At this time, a vessel may run through Brehat channel into Brehat road without risk, for the channel, which is only 2 cables wide at low water, is then 5 cables wide. Chenal de Brehat. \u2014 Having rounded the Roc'h-ar-Bel ledge, the leading mark through Brehat channel is, the white pyramid beacon on the Cormorandiere rock on with the white beacon tower at Port Moguer, near Plouha point, bearing S. | W. ; this line leads 6 cables westward of the Pain de Bray rock and leaves the whole plateau des Echaudes on the port hand, passing its nearest rock, the Cadic, which has 15 feet on it at low water, at 1\u00a3 cables. It also leaves on the starboard hand, the Roc'h-ar-Bel at 4 cables, the Men du-Castrec at 8 cables, and the Pen-Azen rocks at 4 cables. Until southward of Paon point, both flood and ebb streams set strongly across the channel, as they do again when Ferlas channel opens, but under cover of ile de Brehat the streams take the direction of the channel. Follow the leading mark given, leaving the red buoy with conical top-mark of the Roc'h Guarine on the starboard hand, until the red tower on Men-Garo rock comes on with the white pyramid on Quistillic rock, then haul more to the westward and bring the Piliers beacon turret on with Lannevez mill W. by S. This latter mark leads into Brehat road, passing 150 yards south eastward of the Basse de Men-Garo, a small patch on which there are about 26 feet, and a long cable north-westward of the Cain-ar-Rat, a 6-feet patch on which there are 23 feet at half tide.

In the former case, and to avoid this risk, vessels pass in-shoie of Roc'h-ar-Bel through the Moisie or Men-du-Castrec channels, see page 69 ; and, crossing the Trieux channel, proceed to Brehat road either by the Kerpont or Brehat channel. If taking the Men-du-Castrec channel with this object, the leading mark as already given is, the white pyramid on Arcouest point on with the red beacon turret on the Vieille du Treou ; this line should be held only until the Moisie beacon turret is on with Heaux lighthouse, and then this latter mark leads between the Sirlots and Men-du-Castrec ledges, northward of Pen-Azen ledge, into the Brehat channel. From half flood to half ebb, vessels of 14 feet draught may run through this passage without any risk. With the wind between N.N.W. and W.S.W., and, even at low water, pilots use it not only for vessels bound to Brehat road, but also for those bound to ports in St. Brieuc bay. If taking the Moisie channel, the leading mark through is, the spire of St. Michel chapel, ile de Brehat, on with Rosedo white beacon tower S. 3\u00b0 E. ; but, as this channel is very narrow, the services of a pilot are indispensable. As Vieille du Treou beacon turret is neared, the mark should be opened a little as it leads very close to that beacon ; cross the Trieux channel in the direction of the entrance to the Kerpont channel, and proceed through that channel by the directions following. Kerpont Channel. \u2014 This channel separates ile de Brehat from ile Beniguet and leads into Brehat road, but is only practicable for vessels of moderate draught after 4 hours flood, when that stream begins to slacken. A rocky ledge which dries 9 feet, named le Pont, connects the two islands ; at high water, springs, there are 22 feet, and at neaps 1\u00b1\\ feet over it. Here the tide at its full strength runs 6 knots. The leading mark through is, the white pyramid on Arcouest point seen in the middle of the space between the high rocks bor dering each side of the channel bearing S. by W. ; which mark may also be used for the Men-du-Castrec channel.

The Kerpont has two outlets to the southward ; one, midway between the south-western point of Brehat and the Noires ledge marked by a red beacon turret on the Petite Pierre Noire, its northern rock, and by a red beacon on the Grande Pierre Noire, its south-eastern rock, which uncovers 17 feet. The other outlet is between this ledge and the large rocks off the eastern side of Raguenezbras isle, marked on their eastern edge by a beacon on a rock which uncovers 19 feet at low water ; the leading mark for this passage is, the rock Beg-ar-Raz on with the westernmost house of Brehat. APPROACHING RADE de BREHAT from EAST and S.E. \u2014 The channels by which the road can be entered from the eastward are not much used, as the tidal streams cross them obliquely, but there is sufficient water for vessels of deep draught even at low water. The first channel eastward of Brehat channel is that between the Horaine and Echaudes ledges on the North, and Men-Marc'h ledge on the South. The leading mark through is, the summit of the high rocky islet Menou, half a mile eastward of La Trinite point, on with the two mills of Lande-Blanche S.W. W. westerly ; the mills are nearly 'in line from this direction. Follow this mark until Arcouest mill is on with a large forked rock lying close north westward of ile Blanche de l'Arcouest W. S., from whence a direct course may be steered for the road ; or, the Ferlas channel may be run through as directed at page 70, if bound for the Trieux river.

In Brehat road, the direction of the stream at the com mencement of the flood, or 5 hours before high water, is S.W. by W. ; its greatest rate is 2 knots at 2^ hours before high water when its direction is E.S.E. The stream begins to run to the N.W. a few minutes after high water. Its greatest rate, 1^ knots, lasts from 3 to 4 hours after high water, when its direction varies from W.N.W. to W. by N. Winds from E.S.E. to S.S.E. cause a heavy sea in the road during the flood. The streams are not strong in Ferlas channel, which is a con tinuation westward of this road ; the streams follow its direction as long aB the banks are uncovered ; the east-going stream then sets towards Arcouest point. About 20 minutes before high water, an eddy comes from Paimpol bay and, after rounding Arcouest point, it sets with some strength towards the south-eastern point of See charts, Nos. 2,557 and 2,669 *."], [106, "HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. III. 78 ile de Brehat, and also crosses the eastern part of Ferlas channel towards the Kerpont. Its rate decreases about the time of high water, but it regains strength when the ebb stream makes, which latter stream takes the direction of this eddy until the banks are uncovered, when it runs westward in the direction of the channel. ANSE and PORT de PAIMPOL\u2014 This deep bay, formed between the high points of Trinite and Plouzec, is dry throughout nearly its whole extent at the lowest tides. Guilben point divides the bay into two parts, and northward of this long neck of land are the principal beaching places, and the port of Paimpol, the entrance to which is between the Kernoa pier, projecting 200 yards from the southern shore, and the North extreme of the quays on the opposite shore. The little river Quinic flows through it and forms a very tortuous channel through the sands of the bay when they uncover. Depths. \u2014 The port dries throughout ; it has a depth of from 13 to 19 feet at high water, springs, and only 5 to 11 feet at neaps. Buoyage. \u2014 The entrance to the harbour, as well as the various channels leading up to it, are buoyed and beaconed in accordance with the French uniform system ; see page 14. The harbour is about 380 yards in length and 250 yards in breadth at its widest part, and the bottom is everywhere \\ soft. The quay frontage, including the pier, is not less than 450 yards in extent, the berths good, and any swell of importance very rarely felt. The bottom however being above the level of half tide, vessels of any size arriving when the tides are taking off are liable to be neaped for several days. A wet dock, 672 feet long and from 252 to 328 feet wide, with the sill at the entrance 16\u00a3 feet above the level of the lowest tides, has been constructed on the eastern side of the tidal harbour. The town of Paimpol has about 1,500 inhabitants ; it has the advantage of railway communication with the main line from Paris to Brest by means of a short line direct from the town to Guincamp on the main line, and is a place of some importance from its extensive deep sea fishery, which employs about 40 or 50 schooners of from 120 to 200 tons. A Life-Boat is stationed at Paimpol. See charts, Nos. 2,557 and 2,669 *."], [107, "Chap. III.] 79 PAIMPOL. \u2014 BEACONS.\u2014 ANCHORAGES. Beacons, &C. \u2014 The bay of Paimpol is easily recognised from seaward ; on its northern side, by point Arcouest with a guard-house on its summit and its white pyramid beacon, northward of point de la Trinite, and by St. Riom isle, high, rocky, and with indented summit ; on its southern side, by the island Mets de Goelo, 6^ cables north-eastward from Plouzec point, high and with rounded grassy top sloping abruptly to the sea on all sides, with Ost-Pic lighthouse at its eastern end, and Torel, a little sugar-loaf islet, between it and Plouzec point. Whilst, marking the off-lying reefs in the central part of the bay, are the Cormorandiere white pyramid and the two beacon turrets marking^the Charpentiers and Gouayan rocks, the former red, the latter black. Anchorage. \u2014 There is anchorage both south-westward and south eastward of St. Riom isle, in the narrow channel separating the mud-banks of Paimpol bay from those which dry at the southern end of this isle. There are two red beacons on the Plateaux des Fillettes, westward of St. Riom. A vessel will have a good berth by mooring North and South, south- westward of the isle, in 4 fathoms, muddy bottom, with the guard-house on Arcouest point on with the eastern extreme of Trinite point ; and, the white pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock between the red beacon on the Denou rock and the north-western rock of the Roho ledge. There is not much sea here, even during strong easterly winds, except at high water. The holding-ground south-eastward of St. Riom isle is good but the anchorage is more exposed to easterly winds. It lies in the direction of the black beacon on the Ar-zel rock on with the summit of ile Blanche de Guilben, W. by S. ; its north-eastern limit is Heaux lighthouse just opening out from behind Arcouest point ; and, its south-western limit, the guard-house on Minar point a little open eastward of Plouzec point. Beaching places.\u2014 The best grounding places in this bay are in front of port Paimpol, northward of Guilben point, and those most used are on the flat between the channel and the rocks bordering the shore from the port to the point. The bottom is mud and sand, and dries about 16\u00a3 feet. The sea is rough here at high water, springs, when it blows hard from the eastward, but the bottom is soft, and the sea goes down before a vessel takes the ground. See oharts, Nos. 2,557 and 2,669 *."], [108, "80 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. III. There is also a good beaching place between the extreme of Guilben point and ile Blanche de Guilben. The best berth is about H cables northward of the isle, where the bottom is soft mud and is about 10 feet above the level of the lowest itides. Another good position, where vessels lie up during the winter, is in the northern part of the bay, in front of the hollow in the shore under the high coast of Lande de Portzdon. At this place, a vessel drawing 10\u00a3 feet will be neaped only one day. Port Lazo, also, in the south-eastern part of Paimpol bay under the high land of Plouzec point, is a good position to beach a vessel of moderate draught. The berths do not dry more than 9^ feet and are well sheltered. LIGHTS. \u2014 Portzdon. \u2014 From the gable end of the keeper's dwelling on Portzdon point, on the northern shore of the bay, one mile from the entrance to Paimpol harbour, is exhibited at 35 feet above high water a fixed light, showing white and red sectors. It shows red through an arc of 7^\u00b0 between N. 63\u00b0 W. and N. 70|\u00b0 W. ; and, ivhite through an arc of 3^\u00b0 between N. 70^\u00b0 W. and N. 74\u00b0 W. ; in all other directions the light is obscured. The white light is visible 11 miles ; the red light, 7 miles. Ost-Pic. \u2014 On the Ost-Pic rock, at the eastern end of Mets de Goelo island, on the southern side of the bay, from a square tower 44 feet high, and at 64 feet above high water, is exhibited an occulting light showing white and red sectors. It shows white from S. 59\u00b0 W. through West to N. 89\u00b0 W. ; red from N. 89\u00b0 W. to N. 51\u00b0 W. ; white from N. 51\u00b0 W. to N. 13\u00b0 W. ; obscured from N. 13\u00b0 W. through North to S. 57\u00b0 E. ; ivhite from S. 57\u00b0 E. to S. 46\u00b0 E. ; and red from S. 46\u00b0 E. through South to S. 59\u00b0 W.

CHANNELS LEADING to ANSE de PAIMPOL.\u2014 There are five channels leading to the anchorages near St. Riom isle, viz., the Trinite, Lastel, St. Riom, Denou, and Jument channels. They are all difficult of access, lying in the midst of the dangers by which Paimpol bay is surrounded in all directions ; and, of the five, See charts, Nos. 2,557 and 2,669 b."], [109, "Chap. III.] PAIMPOL. \u2014 LIGHTS.\u2014 CHANNELS INTO. 81 two only, the Denou and the Jument, are, after half flood, practicable without a pilot. Trinite Channel, the entrance to which is southward of Brehat road between the Piliers rocks and those off the northern end of ile Blanche de l'Arcouest, is generally taken by vessels bound to Paimpol in charge of pilots, who have conducted them through the Moisie or Men-du-Castrec and Kerpont channels, see pages 69 and 75. It unites with the Lastel channel half a mile northward of Trinite point. Lastel channel is a narrow passage southward of the Men- Gam rock and of the rocky ledge extending from the southern end of ile Blanche de l'Arcouest. Pilots generally take vessels to sea from Paimpol through this channel. St. Riom channel is the narrowest of all, and is but seldom used. It is close to the north-western side of St. Riom isle, between it and the Vras rock. Denou channel is just eastward of St. Riom isle, between Garap and Rohan-heir ledges. It carries a depth of 19 feet and bas the advantage of lying in the direction of the flood stream, but it is narrow and, including the space which separates it from ile de Brehat, can only be navigated by the aid of a good local pilot, and with a fair wind. After half flood, if the leading mark can be seen, a vessel may run through without risk. Jument Channel. \u2014 The entrance to this channel is about 1\\ miles northward of Plouzec point, between two large and remark able rocks one mile apart in a N. by E. \\ E. and S. by W. \\ W. direction ; the one is the Ost-Pic, already mentioned, at the eastern extreme of Mets de Goelo island, on which stands the lighthouse ; the other, at the south-eastern edge of the Roho ledge. The channel has only 1\\ feet at low water, springs, but at half flood there are 22 feet on the bank extending from the southern part of the Roho ledge to the Jument rock. The J ument, Gueule, and Gouayan rocks divide this channel into two parts, both of which are practicable for vessels of moderate See charts, Nos. 2,557 and 2,669 b."], [110, "82 [Chap. III. HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. draught. The Jument uncovers 1\\ feet, the Gueule 3 feet, and the Gouayan 16 feet at the lowest tides. The Jument and the Gouayan have beacon turrets, the Jument being painted with red and white bands, and the Gouayan, black ; the Gueule lies midway between the beacons, about half a mile E.S.E. of the Jument, and is marked on its northern side by a black buoy with cylinder top-mark. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Denou channel.\u2014 If bound to Paimpol bay from the northward, through the Brehat channel, and intending to run through the Denou channel to the anchorages under St. Riom isle, to the harbour of Paimpol, or to any of the beaching places in the bay ; having passed through Brehat channel by the directions already given at page 74, steer S.S.W. f W. with Rundavi mill on with the red beacon on Denou rock, which rock is only about 2\\ cables E.S.E. from the eastern point of St. Riom isle. Pass within 25 yards westward of this rock as the Basse du Denou, nearly awash at low water, is but 60 yards westward of it, leaving a channel only 50 yards wide through which the tide runs with great strength. Having passed the Denou, the black beacon on Ar-zel rock on with the summit of ile Blanche de Guilben W. \u00a7 S. leads to the anchorage south-eastward of St. Riom isle, or the vessel may be steered for one of the beaching places in the bay. The leading mark given, Rundavi mill on with Denou rock beacon, passes very closely westward of la Petite Moisie black beacon, the Moisie rock which does not cover, the Rohan-hier ledge, and the Guillaume rocks, of which the western but deepest end touches the line of direction ; and, eastward of Lei-Done, the north-western rock of Bongreve ledge, the Garap ledge and black beacon, the Valve rock, and the rocks extending eastward from St. Riom. Jument Channel.\u2014 If the Jument channel be preferred ; having run through Brehat channel, bring Ost- Pic lighthouse on with the white pyramid on the Cormorandiere S.S.W. and the vessel will pass eastward of the Ca'in-ar-Monse rock, described at page 77 ; when southward of this rock, or when the guard-house on Arcouest point bears W. \\ N., steer south-eastward to bring Plouzec mill on with the eastern fall of Mets de Goelo islet S.W. by S. This line leads a cable eastward of the Cormorandiere bank. From thence, Plouzec mill on with Ost-Pic lighthouse, S.W., leads eastward of the Charpentiers ledge, marked by a red beacon turret, and to the entrance of the channel, for which no leading mark can be given, but pass northward of the See charts, Nos. 2,557 and 2,669 *."], [111, "Chap. III.] PAIMPOL.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. 83 beacon turrets on the Gouayan and Jument rocks and anchor, or steer for a beaching place as before directed. Approaching from the south-eastward, a vessel should pass between the coast and the off-lying shoals between Minar and Plouzec points, and between the Ost-Pic and the Calemarguiers rocks, by keeping the summit of the large rock at the south-eastern part of the Roho ledge on with the eastern point of Ar-Morbic rock N. \\ W. This rock is on the eastern side of Brehat, and on this bearing appears as part of it ; the eastern point of Brehat is high, well defined, and is the eastern extreme of land seen to the northward. Give the Ost-Pie a berth of about 2 cables in rounding, and from thence steer for the anchorages or grounding places, passing southward of the beacon turrets on the Gouayan and Jument. At night. \u2014 Vessels approaching Paimpol anchorages at night can only enter by the Jument channel, and if from the eastward or southward must be guided by the red and white sectors of Ost-Pic and Portzdon lights in so doing. Coming from the northward through Brehat channel, a vessel should enter the sector of white light shown from Paon point, and keep within its limits until Portzdon white light is seen, towards which she must then steer ; Paon point light will then change to red, and finally become obscured ; half a mile farther, Heaux light will be masked by St. Riom isle when the anchor should be instantly let go, and the vessel will be in about 5 fathoms. Tides and Tidal Streams.\u2014 It is high water, full and change at Paimpol at 6h. Om.; springs rise 31 feet, neaps 23^ feet above the zero of soundings ; but, the bottom being above the level of half tide, there are only 13 feet in the harbour at high water, ordinary springs. The flood stream which enters Paimpol bay, after rounding the south western part of ile de Brehat, sets S.S.W. and S.S.E.; but, at about four hours flood, its direction is S.S.W. and S.W. and an eddy begins to follow the windings of the shore from Mets de Goelo towards Arcouest point. The breadth of this eddy increases rapidly ; at one hour before high water it extends to the anchorage south-eastward of St. Riom isle, and at this time, and even after half flood, a vessel running from Brehat road to Paimpol with a light wind, had better pass eastward of St. Riom isle, and even of the Cormorandiere rock, rather than attempt the Trinite channel, which can only be taken when the wind is sufficiently strong to stem this eddy. See charts, Nos. 2,557 and 2,669 b."], [112, "84 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. III. The ebb stream follows the same direction as the eddy on the flood and forms an eddy behind each projecting point of the coast ; but, as the banks uncover, the body of the stream trends more and more towards Brehat, southward of which it divides, one part passing eastward of the isle ; the other, after crossing Brehat road, running through Kerpont channel, and between the islets and rocks westward of it. The velocity of both streams increases in the narrow channels, but around the Cormorandiere bank, as well as eastward of Mets de Goelo and of Minar point, it does not exceed 4 knots at springs and 2 knots at neaps. st GRAND LEJON is the highest head of a rocky ledge 9 cables in extent, N.E. by E. and S.W. by W., nearly midway between ile de Brehat and Cape Frehel ; it is near the southern edge of the ledge, dries 23 feet at low water, and covers 2\\ hours before high water, springs.

Tidal Streams. \u2014 The flood stream sets into the Baie de St. Brieuc from the north-westward and the ebb stream out of the bay in the opposite direction. Amongst the dangers surrounding the bay, the flood stream makes about half an hour after low water at St. Malo, and the ebb stream half an hour after high water at that port ; in the offing each stream is about an hour later. The streams run with great strength in the vicinity of the Grand and Petit Lejon, from 2 to 4 knots, and the sea is heavy in bad weather. Around the Petit Lejon the streams are rotatory, the flood commenc ing by running westward, shifting through S.W. and South, at its maximum strength, and finishing at East ; the ebb commences at N.E., acquires its maximum at about North and ends at N.W.

Taureau rock \u2014 Beacon turrret. \u2014 The Taureau rock, which uncovers 33 feet at the lowest tides, lies in the bight between Minar point and the Mauve rock, and is marked by a stone beacon turret painted with red and black bands. The white pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock open about half a point eastward of Minar point, leads eastward of it. The Mauve is a large rock off Plouha guard-house, 4 cables from the shore, and 3 cables north-eastward of the Pommier rock, which atter is close to the shore and has its top whitened to serve as a daymark. The Mauve never covers, and forms with other rocks surrounding it a ledge 4 cables long East and West. The Place de Greve, the Traverse, and the Oiseaux, are shoal patches nearly on the parallel of Plouha point, and 1\\ to 2\\ miles from it. The Place de Greve, the shoalest and nearest the shore, carries a depth of 3 fathoms, and, from it, the southern mill of Plouzec is on with the centre of the Mauve rock ; the other two patches have from 5 to 7 fathoms over them. Abreast of the Bee de Vir and 5^ cables from the shore is the northern end of St. Mark bank, which, from thence, extends about a mile southward with a least depth of 2| fathoms.

Directions. \u2014 Vessels approaching either the roadstead or port of Portrieux from any direction, may do so by passing between St. Quay rocks and the coast, or by rounding the southern end of these rocks, according as tide and wind best serve. To pass between St. Quay rocks and the coast ; bring the Mouliere red beacon turret on with Four rock white beacon turret about S. W. This mark leads between the northern part of St. Quay rocks and St. Mark bank, and should be kept on until the vessel has arrived within 3^ cables N.E. by E. of St. Quay point, when Herflux black beacon turret and Longue red beacon turret will be in line and should be steered for to clear the Mouliere rocks which uncover 15 feet, until the Four white beacon turret is on with the lofty spire of Pordic church S. by W. | W. ; follow this direction until the leading mark for the southern part of the channel comeb on, viz., the Hergue white beacon turret and Pommier rock in line N.N.W. \\ W., passing between the conical black buoy of the Noirs on the port hand, and See chart, No. 2,669 *. F 2 SO 11886"], [118, "90 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap. III. the red buoy marking the Pi-Alien shoal on the starboard hand. In steering with the Four beacon turret on with Pordic spire, if the vessel is above 14 feet draught, do not wait until the Hergue and Pommier rocks are in one, but leave that direction the moment the Hergue is on with Plouha point. The vessel, if not drawing more than 14 feet, may now either anchor in Portrieux road, as directed, or, if the tide suits, she may run on S.S.E. J E. with Hergue and Pommier rocks in one, remembering that this mark leads over the Basse Meridionale de la Rade, shoal of 6 feet ; close to another of 8 feet, 3 cables N.W. of the 6-feet shoal ; and, over the Traverse, a sand-bank which trends upwards of 1\\ miles in a S.S.W. direction from the southern part of St. Quay rocks and on which the least water is 4 feet. When Etables steeple is on with that of Plourhan N.W. by W. ; or, when cape Frehel lighthouse is on with the highest point of the Comtesse rocks, the vessel may either haul to the eastward with the latter mark on, or steer for Port Binic, avoiding the Ours-Seul rock, which uncovers 9 feet and is 4 cables from the shore 1\u00a3 miles northward of that port, and 1\\ miles southward of the Four rock, by keeping the Mouliere red beacon turret on with the eastern end of the Mauve rock. Approaching the roadstead by the southern passage, it is necessary to ascertain that there is a sufficient rise of tide to cross the Traverse bank and other shoal patches just named. The height of the tide by the Ronde and Longue rocks, which uncover 25 and 26 feet, is a useful indication of the depth on these shoals. To enter the port of Portrieux, the leading mark is Portrieux spire on with the extreme end of the pier ; this leaves at a short distance on the port hand the Four, Vache, and Pannerais rocks. The Vache uncovers 7 feet, and the Pannerais 12 feet, at the lowest tides. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots for Portrieux also take vessels to ports Binic and Legue ; they generally cruise as far seaward as the Lejons. No stranger should attempt the channel between the roches de St. Quay and the coast, or enter either of these ports without a pilot.

At springs, the greatest strength of the flood between Harbour isle and St. Quay point, as well as among the rocks northward of the road, is 4^ knots ; the strength of the ebb is rather less. PORT BINIC is less than 3 miles southward of Portrieux, about 5 miles N.W. f N. from Roselier point, and dries from 10 to 20 feet at low water ; it is at the head of a little bay half a mile wide and open to the eastward. It consists of an outer and inner harbour. The outer harbour is formed by the Penthievre mole which extends 384 yards from the northern point of the bay in a south-easterly direction, its outer portion turning abruptly southward ; at its outer end is the lighthouse. The entrance to the inner harbour is between two stone jetties ; it is 550 yards in length eastward and westward, and has an average breadth of 93 yards. It is greatly sheltered by the Penthievre mole, though, as the bay is naturally quite open eastward, the swell and sea caused by easterly gales are much felt in both, but improvements to obviate this inconvenience are now (1896) in progress. Depths. \u2014 The outer port dries 10 feet in the entrance at low water ; it can be entered by vessels of about 10 feet draught at high water, ordinary neaps, and those of 14 feet can enter it from 1^ hours before to 11, hours after high water, springs. It affords good shelter, with winds from South round by West to N.N.W. ; with strong winds from North round by East, the shelter is bad, but will be improved by the breakwater now under construction ; with these winds, it is necessary to enter at the top of high water. The berths at the foot of the eastern inner jetty dry 17 feet, and those near the landing creek at the upper end of the port 25 feet above the lowest tides ; those alongside l'Estacade, the southern jetty, are the highest. The town of Binic has over 1 ,000 inhabitants and its chief industry consists in its deep sea fishery, several vessels leaving the port annually for the Newfoundland cod fishery. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed white light is exhibited from a circular granite tower on the mole-head at port Binic ; it is 36 feet above high water and is visible 10 miles. Several small lights are shown within the harbour during the progress of the new works especially a small red light on the See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [120, "HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL. [Chap.

Directions.\u2014 When bound to port Binic, if the wind is between N.N.E. and W.S.W. a vessel with a sufficient rise of tide, may pass between the shore and St. Quay rocks ; with the wind between N.N.E. and E.S.E. she can pass on either side of these rocks ; but, if between S.E. and S.W., she should keep eastward of them. With strong winds from N.E. to East, a vessel should always pass eastward of them, but should not venture so far into the bay until the tide has risen sufficiently high over the broad flats in front of the port, allowing for the 'scend of the sea, to prevent all risk of striking the ground in crossing them. In entering, keep between the jetty and the buoys in the interior of the harbour. Passing eastward of St. Quay rocks, which it is generally prudent to do at neaps ; if, after rounding their south-eastern extreme, it is found that the vessel cannot fetch port Binic, shelter may be sought under Roselier point, 5 miles south-eastward of Binic ; see also Directions at page 96. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Port Binic at 6h. 3m.; springs rise 30 feet, neaps 22| feet above the zero of soundings. When the Longue rock, at the southern part of the St. Quay group is awash, there are 14f feet at the foot of the outer pier-head of port Binic ; 11 feet at the entrance of port Legue ; 12^ feet at the entrance of port Dahouet ; and, nearly 23 feet on the grounding places close southward of Roselier point. When the highest head of the Trahillions ledge, or the Grand Lejon rock, cover (they both uncover 23 feet at springs) there are 11| feet at the outer pier-head of port Binic ; 7| feet at the entrance of Legue ; 9^ feet at the entrance of Dahouet. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels waiting tide to enter either port Binic or port Legue can anchor, in fine weather, abreast of Binic on a bottom of clayey mud in about 3 fathoms, with the Pommier rock and Hergue white beacon turret in line N.N.W. \u00a3 W. The COAST rises in height gradually from St. Quay point to Binic, between which place and Roselier point it is high and steep, except at Rosaires beach south-eastward of Pordic Point, where boats can always land with off-shore winds.

On the bank northward of Binic are several rocks besides the Four and Ours-Seul, both already described. Close westward of the Four is Fille rock, which dries 19 feet, and 2 cables southward of it is Noyes ledge, which dries 2 feet above the bank. The Equerrets, Petit-Gripet, and Grand-Gripet, three small rocky ledges abreast of Rosaires beach, are dangerous to vessels borrowing too closely on the shore. The highest head of the Equerrets bears E. by S. \\ S. 8 cables from the foot of Pordic point and uncovers about a foot. The highest head of the Petit-Gripet uncovers about a foot, and is about 5 cables from the shore, with the Martin rock on with the foot of Roselier point S. by E. \\ E. The Martin is a high rock which never covers and is near the shore northward of Roselier point ; shoal water extends 1\\ cables eastward of it. There are more than 14 feet water on the Petit-Gripet when the eastern extreme of the Martin rock is covered. The Grand-Gripet, with 2 feet over it, bears N. by E. \u00a7 E. nearly ly miles from the Martin, the summit of which is then a little east ward of the principal house of a large farm on the high land. ROSELIER POINT, 5 miles S.E. S. from port Binic, is high and steep on its northern and southern sides, but terminates in a gentle declivity eastward. If a vessel can take the ground, there is excellent shelter close southward of this point on the northern shore of a little bay called port Aurelle, protected from all winds from South round by West to N.E. The bottom, of muddy sand, dries only 3 feet above the lowest tides, so that, if of about 14 feet draught, she can run for shelter from two hours before to two hours after high water. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on Roselier point ; see page 12. The COAST between Roselier and Pleneuf points, which bear E. \u00a3 N. and W. i S. distant 6f miles from each other, falls back to the southward and forms the head of St. Brieuc bay, in which are port Legue, the Anse d'Yffiniac, and port Dahouet. Several dangers front this part of the shore, of which the farthest in the offing are the Trahillions, Basse Herbaut, Trois Tetes, and the Dahouet. See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [122, "[Chap. III.

A rock with only 4 feet water lies N.E. by E. \\ E. 1\\ cables from the Herbaut. The Trois Tetes, lying between the Herbaut and Dahouet rocks, have only 2 feet over them, and their inner head, called the Armelent rock has on it a red beacon. A vessel will pass outside all these dangers by keeping the summit of cape d'Erqui open northward of Petit Verdelet islet about the width of that rock ; or, by keeping Rohinet rock, off cape d'Erqui, on with the highest head of the Jaunes rocks, off Pleneuf point, N.E. by E. \u00a7 E. ; and, 200 yards westward of the Trahillions, by keeping the spire of the church of St. Pierre at St. Brieuc, or the mill near the church, on with the houses of Sous-la-Tour, a little hamlet in front of Cesson tower, at the foot of the high land which forms the southern side of the entrance to the river Gouet. LEGUE or PORT de St. BRIEUC is about a mile within the mouth of the river Gouet, the entrance to which is 1\\ miles southward of Roselier point and between Chatern and Cesson points, the latter being the north-western extreme of Yffiniac bay. Legue owes its importance to the proximity of the large town of St. Brieuc, only a mile distant and with a population of 16,500. St. Brieuc is in direct railway communication with Paris and Brest, and also with the Morbihan coast line. The port extends to the bridge above the town of Legue and has over 1,500 yards of wharfage, besides a wet dock 325 yards long and averaging 71 yards wide, which has, however, only 14^ feet water, at springs ; there are also two careening slips 230 and 131 feet long, and 164 and 98 feet wide respectively. Between 500 and 600 vessels enter the port annually, their average tonnage being 54 tons, and one-third of them are either English or Norwegian. A considerable steam traffic exists at certain seasons between here and the Channel islands.

On the summit of Cesson point are the ruins of Cesson Castle, of which the tower serves as a landmark and can be seen from a distance of 15 miles. From a little northward of Chatern point, the channel into port Legue is marked by beacons and buoys, red on the northern and black on the southern side. LIGHT. \u2014 A fixed ivhite light, visible 10 miles, is exhibited at 43 feet above high water, from a circular tower on Aigle point, at the northern side of the entrance of port Legue. Bane de Chatern and Galettes rocks are the only dangers to be avoided when entering port Legue. The bank trends in a S. by W. direction from Roselier point and rests upon Chatern point. The Galettes is a small ledge which uncovers 10 feet, 3 cables eastward of Cesson point. Directions. \u2014 When bound to Legue, if from the westward, follow the directions given at pages 64, 74, 89, and 96, until southward of the St. Quay rocks ; or, if from the eastward, those given at pages 102, 104, until past the Rohein rock ; then steer to bring Roselier and Cesson points in line S.S.W. \u00a7 W., which will be the leading mark until within 2 miles of Roselier point ; then steer towards Pature point until the northern tower of the church of St. Michel, at St. Brieuc, is seen between the southern tower of the same church, on which there is a telegraph, and the most southerly houses of Sous-la-Tour hamlet, which mark leads to the entrance of the port. Vessels before bearing up for the port should carefully estimate the depth of water over the sands in its front by observing the height of the tide at the Longue rock, or at the Martin rock. When the eastern head of the latter is awash, there are only 3 feet in the channel from off point Aigle to Sous-la-Tour hamlet ; when the next head to this is awash, there are 1\\ feet at the same place ; and, when the Longue rock is awash, there are 11 feet.

At high water, springs, there are 19 feet abreast of the pier-head, and 10^ feet at neaps. When the Longue rock is awash, there are 12^ feet water at the entrance ; when the Bignons des Jaunes are awash there are 10^ feet, and when the highest head of the Trahillions covers there are 9^ feet.

Directions. \u2014 When bound to ports Binic, Legue, or Dahouet from the westward, follow the directions given for passing between the Barnouic and Horaine ledges, see page 64 ; or, for passing through the Brehat channel, see page 74. If from the eastward, follow those given at pages 103-105 until past the Rohein rock. If the Brehat channel is taken ; when Paon point and Heaux lighthouses are in line N.W. | N., haul to the south-eastward and steer with this as the leading mark until the -two mills of Lande Blanche are on with Lemenez isle W. \\ S.; the vessel is then about one mile westward of the Banes de Sable, and a S. by E. | E. course leads between the St. Quay and Rohein rocks, passing about one mile eastward of the red bell-buoy of the plateau des Hors. When southward of the St. Quay rocks, a vessel may haul up for Binic or steer for Legue as already directed. If for Dahouet, when southward of the Rohein which bears N. by W. 4f miles from the entrance of the port, the only dangers to be avoided are the Bignons, the Basse Godiche, and the Dahouet rocks, already described. With the wind between S.W. and S.S.E. a vessel should always pass eastward of the Horaine, in rounding which take care she is not set too far eastward by the flood. When southward of the Grand Lejon, and to avoid the Petit Lejon, do not open the summit of the Comtesses westward of the southern extreme of Bien-Assis wood ; and, in approaching the Rohein ledge, keep Guettes point well open See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [126, "[Chap.

In standing to the westward, be careful not to approach too near the St. Quay rocks ; Pature point kept open westward of Mener- Bel-Air hills, at least double the apparent distance between their eastern and western peaks, leads a safe distance eastward of them, and when Cape Frehel lighthouse is on with the highest head of the Comtesses, or when Etables and Plourhan church steeples in line bear N.W. by W. she is southward of their south-eastern extreme. At Night, after rounding the Horaine, the Grand Lejon white flashing light is an excellent guide for entering St. Brieuc bay. A vessel should pass about 2 miles westward of it, and, on entering its western red sector, edge to the eastward to cross that sector and enter the white flashing sector of light ; having done which, she should steer about S.S.W. between the St. Quay rocks and the Rohein, keeping carefully within the white flashing sector of Grand Lejon light. Having brought port Binic white fixed light to bear W. by N. \\ N. she will be southward of all danger and may, if desired, haul up for it and anchor in from 3 to 5 fathoms to await daylight. If for port Dahouet, keep in the white sector of its light. The general aspect of the coast from Pleneuf point to Cape Frehel has been already given at page 59. A description of the numerous rocks and shoals by which this shore is fronted will now follow. THE ROHEIN and COMTESSES ROCKS, are two rocky ledges, the first 5 miles and the second 3j miles in a W.N.W. direction from cape d'Erqui. The Rohein rock, at the south-western extreme of the Rohein ledge, is high above the level of the highest spring tides, and, from its isolated position, is easily recognised from some distance. This ledge is about one mile in diameter, many heads are uncovered at low water, and others awash, or nearly so. On its southern edge, eastward of the Rohein rock, the Basse Ronde uncovers 26 feet, and the Basses du-Sud-Est, 24 feet. At its northern extreme, the Basse des Daouelins is a dangerous patch ; from the least water on it, 3 feet, the extreme of cape Frehel touches the southern side of the Rohinet rock E. f S. southerly ; and, Pature point is a little open westward of the Rohein S.W. by S.

Westward of Amas-du-Cap, between it and St. Michel islet, are several rocky clusters 7 or 8 cables off-shore ; the principal are, the Plate St. Michel, on which stands a red beacon with conical top-mark, the Mouillee which uncovers 13 feet, the Malicorne, the Truie, nearly awash, and the Jars which uncovers 12 feet at the lowest tides. ERQUI BAY is a small beaching place on the southern shore of the peninsula terminated by cape d'Erqui, opposite the village of Erqui which is in the south-eastern corner of the bay. Vessels ground on a bottom which dries about 16 feet above the lowest tides, and are sheltered from N.N.W. round by East to South. The southern side of the bay is formed by the lofty point of Lahoussaye, which is prolonged seaward by an islet and some rocks. A jetty in the northern angle of the bay, 1\u00a3 cables westward of the little hamlet of La Chaussee, affords shelter against westerly See chart, No. 2,669 *."], [130, "HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL.

A black beacon with cylindrical top-mark is placed about 130 yards southward of the pier. A small red light is shown from the end of the masonry. About 150 coasting vessels enter this little port annually. Rade d'Erqui, close southward of cape d'Erqui and fronting Erqui bay, is the only anchorage on the eastern shore of St. Brieuc bay affording tolerable shelter, in 5 or 6 fathoms water, from easterly winds. The holding-ground is good, but it is prudent to leave it, especially in the winter season, if the weather is threatening and the wind likely to veer to the westward. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the summit of cape d'Erqui ; see page 12. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Erqui roads at 6h. ; equinoctial springs rise 43 feet, ordinary springs 33j feet, and ordinary neaps 24^ feet above the soundings. CHENAL d'ERQUI is the passage between the belt of rocks bordering the coast from cape d'Erqui to St. Michel islet, on the one hand, and the Grand-Pourier, Rohinet, and Justieres ledges on the other. The depth is not less than 2\\ fathoms in the fairway of this channel at low water, springs, when it can be navigated only by small coasters ; with a free wind, vessels of deep draught may pass through from half flood to half ebb. Anchorage. \u2014 If windbound with strong northerly gales, some shelter may be found during neaps by anchoring southward of the Plate St. Michel rock, with the Rohinet rock nearly touching the eastern shore of St. Michel islet. The depths here are from 19 to 22 feet, with good holding-ground of muddy sand. Bouche d'Erqui. \u2014 This inlet is nearly 3 miles eastward of cape d'Erqui and about a mile in extent ; it dries at low water and its shore is formed of white sandy downs. About half a mile north ward of Champ du Port point, the western point of the inlet, is the islet of St. Michel before alluded to, which is joined to the coast at low water and on which stands a chapel, very useful as a seamark This is the only place on this part of the coast where, in bad weather and when compelled to do so, a vessel can run ashore with See chart, No. 2,669 b,"], [131, "Chap.

Life-Boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Pleherel, a fishing village about 2 miles eastward of Bouche d'Erqui and 3 miles westward of cape Frehel. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels bound eastward and surprised by easterly winds when in the neighbourhood of the Lejons, may bear up for shelter and run for the rade d'Erqui by the Landas channel, by that between the Rohein and Petit Lejon, or between the Rohein and the Jaunes to leeward of all the outer shoals, as wind and tide may best serve. Through the Landas Channel.\u2014 If far enough to windward, this channel, between the Petit Lejon and Pierres du Bane, is practicable for vessels of the deepest draught after half flood. Three sand-banks, dangerous only from the heavy sea they occasion when it blows hard on a weather tide, lie in this channel ; from the largest, on which there are 4^ fathoms, Tournemine mill is on with the Verdelet rock S.S.W \u00b1 W.

E. Follow this latter mark until within about 5 cables of cape d'Erqui, when steer for Erqui road. A vessel will keep eastward of the Petit Lejon by having the Verdelet rock open eastward of the summit of the Comtesses ; she will also pass north-eastward of the Basse des Comtesses, and of the Comtesses, by keeping Turquet mill in sight eastward of Lahoussaye point, which mark will also ensure her not being too close to the eastern part of the Portes d'Erqui, marked by a red beacon turret. The dangers on the eastern side of the channel may be avoided by not standing eastward of the line of Turquet mill just touching the high land of cape d'Erqui. See chart, No. 2,669 b.

The summit of the Comtesses on with the southern extreme of Bien-Assis wood S. by E. | E. leads 5 cables westward of the Grand Lejon and 2 cables westward of the Petit Lejon, close to the black bell-buoy marking the latter. Steer with this mark on until past the Petit Lejon, when Turquet mill will be on with Lahoussaye point ; haul up for it, opening the mill a little eastward of the point to avoid the Comtesses, &c, and this will lead into the road as before. In following this route before half flood, great care must be taken to avoid the Daouelins and Comtesses patches, and the Izard rock, Portes d'Erqui, on the southern side of the channel, as well as the Petit Lejon on the northern side ; also, at low water and in bad weather, a 21-feet patch S. by E. \\ E. 1\\ cables from the Petit Lejon. The Channel between the Rohein and the Jaunes may be taken by a vessel too much to leeward for either of the others, and it is sufficiently deep for vessels of moderate draught even at low water.

The most dangerous part of this channel is when cape d'Erqui bears between S.S.W. and S. \u00a3 W. ; the vessel is then abreast of the rocky patches of the southern part of the Rohinet plateau which dry 5 feet at the lowest tides, and are marked by a red buoy at their edge. The Erqui channel may also be run Hor by passing through the shoal patches between the Petite Liviere and the Bignons rocks when there is sufficient water, and the depth is never less than 16 feet over any of them, nor does the sea break in the eddies caused by them. The leading mark through, is, the guard-house on Pleneuf point on with the rock at the extreme of cape d'Erqui S.W. by W. \\ W. ; when the extreme of cape Frehel is on with the southern end of Amas-du-Cap E. \\ S., proceed as before. When running through the Erqui channel for any of the ports on the western coast of St. Brieuc bay, proceed as if bound for Erqui road until the highest summit of the Comtesses rocks is on with the Rohein W. by N. \\ N. ; then steer westward in this direction, passing 2 or 3 cables southward of the Comtesses, Lue, and Rohein rocks. After passing the Comtesses, their highest point on with the Rohinet leads southward of the Rohein and also of the St. Quay rocks.

Tidal Streams. \u2014 The flood stream sets about East, and the ebb West through the Erqui channel ; at springs, both streams run at the rate of 4 knots. Round cape Frehel it runs with great strength, at least 5 knots, and there are strong eddies occasioning a heavy breaking sea in bad weather. To avoid these, although the cape is steep-to, vessels should give it a berth of one or two miles at such a time. See chart, No. 2.669 b. G-2 SO 118S6"], [134, "106 HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE TO CAPE FREHEL.

The general direction of the coast line from point to point is south-easterly for nearly 7 miles from cape Frehel to the ile des Ehbiens ; from thence it is easterly for 15 miles to pointe de Grouin, the western point of the large but shallow Baie du Mont St. Michel ; here the coast trends suddenly southward for about 6 miles, then eastward for about 15 miles, and, lastly, northward about 8 miles to pointe de Champeaux, the eastern point of the bay, which bears from pointe de Grouin E. \u00a7 S. 11 miles, the coast line following the circuit of the bay being at least thrice that distance. From pointe de Champeaux, pointe du Roc bears North 5| miles.* About half way between cape Frehel and pointe de Grouin is the large and important port and town of St. Malo, at the entrance of the river Ranee ; between it and cape Frehel are several small harbours and deep but shallow bays with anchorages fairly sheltered against westerly winds, but the whole of the coast between these two points is fronted by numerous dangerous rocks and ledges extending from one to*4 miles from the land.

[Chap. IV. 108 Between Cape Frehel and point de Grouin the general aspect of the shore is rocky, rugged, and moderately high ; but, within the bay of St. Michel, from Chateau Richeux point eastward, it is very low, flat, and marshy. It again rises in the vicinity of pointe de Champeaux, a bluff and nearly perpendicular headland, and from thence to Granville is of moderate height, the flat sands extending off it in this neighbourhood being interspersed by low, flat, rocky ledges. ANSE des SEVIGNES, a small bay open to the N.E. between cape Frehel and Latte point, has many dangers within it, and should not be run for as a place of shelter in heavy weather from the S.W., on account of the great overfalls in it caused by the steepness of the coast, and the violent squalls off the land to which it is subject. Bane de FEtendree lies off the northern part of Sevignes bay ; from the Etendree rock at its western end, which uncovers 14^ feet, it extends about 8 cables in a S.E. by E. direction, and is 2^ cables wide ; some parts are nearly awash at the lowest tides. Basse de la Latte and Basse Raimonde. \u2014 These rocks, lying southward of the bane de l'Etendree, render the approach to Sevignes bay or to within a mile of this rugged and precipitous coast very dangerous, though the fishermen congregate here occasionally in great numbers. The Latte bears N.N.E. E. 3^ cables from the fort on Latte point, and uncovers a foot at the lowest tides ; the Raimonde bears N.N.W. \\ W. 4 cables from the fort, and uncovers 9 feet. Frehel lighthouse on with pointe de la Teignouse, the first point southward of cape Frehel, leads between the Basse de la Latte and Latte point ; St. Jacut mill well open of St. Cast point leads outside all the dangers off the Anse des Sevignes.

At high water, vessels under 9^ feet draught can cross the high bank whir-h dries out from the head of the bay, and reach the beaching places of Po^t-Nieux and Port-a-la-Duc. Both are on the western shore, the first behind, and the latter about a mile south westward of Muret point.

Bourdinots rocks. \u2014 Buoy.\u2014 These are two small rocky ridges, one 6 cables, the other 1^ miles E. \\ N. from St. Cast point. The easternmost ridge, on which there are 34 feet water, is dangerous only when blowing hard ; but the westernmost ridge, on which the highest rock dries 7 feet, must be carefully avoided. A red buoy is moored one cable north-eastward of it. The marks for this rock are, a white wall on with the summit of the Bec-Rond rock about W. by S. \\ S. ; and, St. Jacut highest windmill open eastward of the summit of Colombiere islet, which islet is half a mile westward of the Ehbiens, S. | E. Grande Conchee rock well open northward of Cezembre isle E. \\- S., or Tertre Morgan windmill in sight northward of St. Cast peninsula W. S., leads northward of both ridges. St. CAST POINT, 4 miles S.S.E. E. from cape Frehel, is high and nearly perpendicular on all sides. The approach to it is rendered dangerous at low water by the Bourdinots, by low- water rocks which extend 3 cables from the foot of the point, and by the Chelin, a small sand-bank with only 10 feet water N. by E. 4^ cables from the point. Teignouse point on with Latte point leads outside the Chelin bank and between St. Cast point and the Bourdinots ridges. Semaphore. \u2014 A semaphore station is established on the summit of St. Cast point ; see page 12. Anse de St. Cast.\u2014 Southward of St. Cast, in front of the village of Lille St. Cast, the coast forms a small bay which affords good shelter from westerly winds to vessels capable of taking the ground.

Arguenon bay. \u2014 From St. Cast point, at low water, dry sands connect the shore with the ile des Ehbiens Imd with the opposite coast in the vicinity of St. Briac harbour, the two deep bays of Arguenon and Lancieux, separated by a narrow promontory ending in point Roche, being then dry throughout. The Arguenon river flows into the head of the bay of Arguenon, and is navigable up to Plancoet, at springs, for vessels of about 9 feet draught. Vessels capable of taking the ground will find shelter from easterly winds on the eastern shore of this bay abreast of an old convent, with St. Jacut windmill bearing S.E., and Ehbiens islet shut in by Chevet point. Here the tides rise from 19 to 26 feet at springs, and 9i feet at neaps. There is also an indifferent grounding place for small coasters abreast of St. Jacut village in Lancieux bay. ILE des EHBIENS, about a mile in circumference, is off point Roche, just described, at the head of the bight between cape Frehel and St. Malo. It is surrounded by high rocks, and near its centre is a large and conspicuous tower which may be recognised from a great distance. It is joined to the shore at low water by the bank of sand which borders the coast from St. Cast point to the entrance to St. Briac. Close southward of Ehbiens is a well-sheltered grounding place, much frequtnted by coasting vessels formerly but not much used since the channels into St. Malo have been well lighted and marked. It is formed by a natural causeway of shingle, always uncovered and uniting the south-western extreme of the island with some high rocks 2 cables to the South-west. The bottom is muddy sand and seaweed, and dries 7 or 8 feet above the lowest tides, which rise from 28 to 35 feet above it at springs, and 18 or 19 feet at neaps. The best place for grounding, sheltered from all winds, is about half a cable from the southern end of the island, with Agot island entirely shut in by the south-eastern extreme of Ehbiens. Beacons. \u2014 There is also anchorage in from 2 to 5 fathoms in the bay between iles des Ehbiens and Agot, but it is open to northerly winds, and in the centre of the bay is the Platus rock, marked by a beacon turret painted with red aud black bandi;.

Directions. \u2014 When running for the grounding place at the southern end of Ehbiens, as soon as the island is made out, steer to pass about 1^ cables eastward of the Haches, a ridge of rocks, of which some are always uncovered, extending 5 cables in a north-easterly direction from its northern point. When Ehbiens tower bears N.W., haul close round the south-eastern point of the island and anchor, or, if necessary, run the vessel on the beach. If obliged to beat in, be careful to avoid the Platus and other rocks just described, as well as a half-tide rock one cable eastward of the high rocks at the southern end of the causeway. St. BRIAC. \u2014This little tidal harbour has little or no trade, is difficult of access, and should never be attempted without a pilot. It is at the entrance of a narrow valley H miles eastward of Ehbiens and about 8 cables southward of the high projecting point of Haye. The entrance, 2 cables wide, is between the Perronais black beacon marking the westernmost rock of the ledge extending south westward from the southern end of Perron isle, about one cable. distant from it and which dries 12 feet, and a red beacon on the extreme of a rocky ridge projecting northward from the peninsula of Lancieux ; this latter rock dries 15 feet at the lowest tides, and, in entering the harbour, a vessel should steer to pass between these two beacons. Approaching the harbour from the north-westward, the leading mark up to the entrance is, Marche mill, which stands south eastward of the village, just touching the mound of the calvary of St. Briac. The channel narrows considerably half a mile within the beacons at the entrance, and a vessel has then to pass between rocky heads, marked by beacons, the highest of which uncovers 19 feet, leaving red beacons on the starboard hand, black beacons on the port hand, and passing the Bouche beacon, in the middle of the channel, on either side ; after which she may anchor or ground as desired ; three warping buoys are placed to assist vessels to their berths. The tides run with great strength in the channel, and the harbour is exposed to a heavy sea with strong north-westerly winds.

There are 6 feet more water at the entrance of the harbour than here. In a little bight in the northern part of the harbour, vessels may lie, out of the stream and sheltered from all winds, on a bottom of soft mud ; but, if of more than 13 or 14 feet draught, they will be neaped for three or four days. OFF-LYING DANGERS.\u2014 The port of St. Malo is 4^ miles east ward of the entrance to St. Briac. Before proceeding to a description of it and of its numerous entrance channels it may be well to describe the off-lying dangers against which the mariner has to guard in approaching this coast. Basse Trouvee. \u2014 This dangerous isolated rock has only 13 feet over it and 14 or 15 fathoms close to on all sides ; it occasions great overfalls during spring's, and the sea breaks heavily over it in bad weather.

ST. MALO.*\u2014 The town of St. Malo stands at the mouth of the river Ranee, on the eastern side, on what was formerly a small rocky island, since connected with the mainland by the Sillon, a narrow causeway three quarters of a mile long. In the construction of the modern Inner harbour, this causeway has been greatly widened and strengthened and now forms the northern side of the Bassin de St. Malo, with extensive quays and railway accommodation. The whole area of the former island is occupied by houses, and the walls are flanked by towers washed by the sea. The manufactures are hosiery, cordage, soap, fishing nets, &c, but they are not extensive ; there is also a tobacco factory. Shipbuilding is carried on, and besides building slips there are two gridirons for repairs, but no facilities for extensive repairs to iron hulls or machinery. Vessels are fitted out for the foreign and coasting trades, the former being chiefly with England and the northern countries of Europe, and for the whale and mackerel fisheries ; about 1,000 vessels enter the port annually. The imports consist chiefly of coal, iron, pitch, &c. ; the exports of barley, butter, potatoes, fruit, wine, provisions, &c. Regular steam communication is maintained with the Channel islands, and from thence with England, by the steamers of the London and South-Western Railway ; and there is regular communication with Cardiff, Hull , St. Brieuc, Granville, and Havre by lines of steamers. Steam ferries ply between Dinard, on the opposite shore of the Ranee, St. Malo, and St. Servan. The population of St. Malo is about 10,000, and that of the adjoining town of St. Servan 12,000 ; St. Servan stands on higher ground and may be considered a suburb of St. Malo.

It is also inconvenient of access to vessels of deep draught during the winter months, owing to the fact of high water, full and change. occurring at 6h. 5m., i.e., before daylight in the morning and after dark in the evening. The harbour of St. Malo contains no dry dock, though two were originally projected ; it consists of the Avant-port sheltered by the Mole, and the Bassin-a-Flot, from which the Bassins of St. Malo and St. Servan are entered. The Bassin-a-Flot is entered from the Avant-port by a passage 320 feet wide between the Bourse quay of St. Malo and the end of the wall and embankment projecting from the northern point of St. Servan ; there is in it a careening pontoon for 300-ton vessels, two gridirons for the same class, and many warping buoys. On its eastern side is an interior reservoir, 66 acres in area, used for flushing purposes and for laying up dismantled shipping. A stone sill, used as a footpath when uncovered, crosses the entrance to the Bassin-a-Flot, and regulates the depth of water retained in this Bassin ; it is raised 11 feet above the level of the lowest tides. Depths. \u2014 The anchorages in St. Malo and Dinard roads are accessible by the Grand Chenal at all times of tide to vessels of the deepest draught. The Avant port dries from 6 to 9 feet at the lowest tides, and has from 31 to 34 feet water at ordinary springs, and 10 feet less at neaps. The Bassin-a-Flot has 29i feet over the sill at high water, springs, and 19 feet at neaps ; the general depth within the Bassin-a-Flot, after the water has fallen to the level of the sill, is from 12 to 16 feet.. The Bassin of St. Malo has an area of 38 acres, a length of 1,143 yards, and a width of 152 yards ; that of St. Servan an area of 33 acres, a length of 826 yards, and a width of 207 yards. The lock entrances are in each case 305 feet long between the gates. Vessels of 13 feet draught can enter the basins at neap tides, and of 23 feet draught at ordinary springs ; but, from the shape of the basins, there is not moorage accommodation for vessels over 295 feet in length and 22 feet draught.

Coals are always obtainable, from 3,000 to 4,000 tons being usually in stock ; vessels coal alongside the quays, where there is always sufficient water for steamers of frcm 1,000 to 1,200 tons. The Mole des Noires, a neat and substantial stone pier, built on the Noires rocks at the south-western angle of the town, in addition to its great convenience for landing passengers, protects the port from the heavy roll of the sea, to which it would be other wise exposed with north-westerly winds. The pier is 1,290 feet long, about 16 feet wide, and at its head is a lighthouse. A Life-Boat is stationed at St. Malo. LIGHTS. \u2014 Five lights are established at and in the vicinity of St. Malo to assist the intricate navigation amongst the numerous dangers which mark the approaches to this port, viz. : \u2014 1. \u2014 Grand Jardin. \u2014 On the south extreme of Grand Jardin islet is a circular lighthouse from which is exhibited a fixed and flashing light ; the light shows white, varied every twenty seconds by alternate red and green flashes, each flash being of two seconds' duration.

PILOTS. \u2014 The St. Malo pilots cruise in all weathers in two cutters : one is stationed near cape Frehel, the other cruises off the port, between it and the Chausey isles ; in bad weather the latter frequently takes shelter under the lee of Cezembre island. There are 10 pilots belonging to St, Malo and 5 pilots at St. Cast ; these latter can always pilot vessels to the roadsteads, but not into the basins unless no St. Malo pilot presents himself ; they may generally be found off ile de Brehat and near the Roches-Douvres. With westerly winds, vessels from the westward requiring pilots should keep near cape Frehel : with north-easterly winds, near the Minquiers rocks. It is the duty of all masters of vessels to facilitate the boarding of a pilot, and to make signals at night by blue lights and flare-up lights ; also, by day, to keepthe pilot jack up until the Bassin is entered. Every pilot has a silver anchor attached to a button-hole of his waistcoat, and has a livret or pocket-book which he is bound to produce on demand. ROADSTEADS. \u2014 There are two fair roadsteads at the mouth of the river Ranee, where vessels of deep draught generally anchor to unload, or to await tide to enter the port ; they are, the Rade de St. Malo and the anchorage of Dinard. The Rade de Solidor, off the bay of that name and abreast of St. Servan, is too shallow and confined to receive vessels of large size. RADE de St. MALO is on the eastern side of the entrance to the Ranee, 4 cables westward of the town of St. Malo ; it occupies a space about 2 cables long, North and South, is a cable wide, and has from 27 to 32 feet water throughout. It is bounded on the North by the Basse Broutard, on the East by the sand-bank which fronts the town and dries at low water, and on the South by the Plateau de la Ranee, the northern head of which bears S. \\ E. 2| cables from the Broutard .

The Merciere beacon on with the eastern head of the Bizeux S. by E. \\ E., leads westward, and the Bourse on with the Noire mole-head leads southward of the 2-feet head near the southern end of the ridge. The Bizeux is a large high rock, lying East and West, to the southward of the Bane de Solidor, described at page 121. Two deep clefts divide its summit into three conspicuous heads. Eastward of this rock is the Petit Bizeux marked by a red beacon. Anchorage. \u2014 The holding-ground in St. Malo road is fairly good, and vessels moor nearly North and South in the direction of the tidal streams. The best position is in the middle of the road, with the eastern head of the Bizeux on with the high rock at the foot of Bechard point ; and, the mound on Garde Guerin point a little open southward of the summit of the Grand Vide. Vessels of light draught anchor a little eastward of this. The road is well-sheltered from all winds between West and N.E. round by South and East, but northerly and north-westerly winds, when they blow with any strength, send in a heavy sea during the time the ledges outside the river are covered, i.e., from 2h. before to 2h. after high water, at springs. The flood stream in the road never exceeds 3 knots ; and the ebb, which Bechard point turns towards the opposite shore, never runs with sufficient strength to prevent communication with the port.

ANSE de DINARD.\u2014 This bay is abreast of St. Malo on the western side of the Ranee, between points Dinard and Vicomte ; grounding places extend along its western shore, from the old ship yard below the village to the new one beneath the mill on Dinard point. The bottom here dries from 12 to 15 feet, with a very gradual slope towards the edge of the bank ; springs rise above it from 18 to 24 feet, neaps 9 or 10 feet ; it is composed of stiff mud covered with seaweed, and when it blows hard from the N.E. vessels strike heavily in grounding, and, as the anchors of small vessels bite with difficulty, care should be taken to bury them in the mud at low water ; avoid also grounding eastward of the line on which Grande Conchee fort begins to open eastward of Dinard point, as the bottom there is deeply furrowed. Dinard anchorage. \u2014 Vessels of deep draught, unable to enter port St. Malo during neaps, often await spring tides at this anchorage, where they are well sheltered from all but northerly winds. It is just outside the outer edge of the mud in Dinard bay, and is half a mile in extent from the Petit Palais rock to the Basse Schevre ; its outer limit does not extend eastward of the line of the Muriers rock, close to the south-western point of Cezembre island, just opening and shutting in with the eastern slope of Dinard point. The best anchorage, where the depths are from 26 to 30 feet, is limited northward by the line of the Solidor tower seen between the extreme of Bechard point and the little fort ; aud, southward, by the same tower open its own breadth northward of the high steeple of St. Servan church. This roadstead is the general rendezvous for vessels of war ; it is preferable to that of St. Malo road, being better sheltered against the prevailing winds, though the holding-ground, except close to the edge of the mud, is not so good, and the tides are stronger. Ships at this anchorage should always be ready to weigh or slip, as bad weather may at any time make it necessary to take shelter farther up the Ranee. See chart, No. 2,700."], [149, "Chap. IV.] ST. MALO.\u2014 DINARD AND SOLIDOR ROADS. 121 ANSE de SOLIDOR, on the western side of the town of St. Servan, is a cable wide at the entrance, and its shores are almost entirely occupied by the military establishments of the town. Merchant vessels remaining some time in the bay are usually placed at the entrance, between the quai des Corbieres and the rocks at the foot of Solidor tower, where the bottom dries 12 or 13 feet, and springs rise from 25 to 32 feet above that level, neaps about 15 feet. A stone slip with a wooden platform at the end, for the accom modation of passengers from Dinard, extends from near the Solidor tower to the edge of the sands which dry ; this is very dangerous to vessels entering Solidor bay. When the Petit Bizeux rock, marked by a red beacon, is awash there are 15 feet water over the platform at the end of the slip. A small grounding place called St. Pere port, in the northern part of the bay at the foot of the peninsula of La Cite, northward of the Solidor tower, is about 84 yards wide, 270 yards deep, and will contain 14 or 15 vessels of the tonnage and draught of those employed in the Newfoundland trade. The grounding places towards the middle of this bay dry 10 feet. Vessels of about 13 feet draught can enter at high water, neaps. Solidor road is a small deep, parallel with the shore, 2 cables long North and South, and only about 80 yards wide between the beach which dries in front of Solidor bay and the Solidor bank, which also dries about 8 feet ; the soundings are shallow, and, being so narrow, long-heeled vessels occasionally take the ground, the greatest depths at low water being 18 feet. The road is sheltered on all sides so long as the bank is uncovered ; but when it blows hard from the westward and the bank is covered there is considerable swell. Two mooring buoys occupy the best positions in this road, and a black beacon on the North extreme of the Zorieux rocks marks its southern extreme. Bane de Solidor bounds Solidor road to the westward, and uncovers 8 feet. Its northern extreme is 85 yards southward of Bechard point ; from thence it extends 3 cables S.S.E. and terminates less than 100 yards northward of the Bizeux rock. It is about a cable broad, and is composed of fine white sand mixed with broken shells. See chart, No. 2,700. SO 11886 H 2"], [150, "122 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. IV. RIVIERE de LA RANCE \u2014 The Ranee is tidal as far as Dinan, 14 miles above St. Malo, and navigable at high water the whole distance ; but, the last anchorage at which vessels of moderate size can lie afloat at low water is at Jouvente, only 3 miles above St. Malo. Tides and tidal Streams.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at port St. Malo at 6h. 5m. ; equinoctial springs rise 45 feet above the zero of soundings, which is the level of the lowest tide known, see page 4 ; ordinary springs rise 40^ feet, ordinary neaps 30 feet. The water rises above the sill of the entrance to the bassin-a-flot 33^ feet at equinoctial springs, 29^ feet at ordinary springs, and 19 feet at ordinary neaps. The height of the tide above this sill is shown on three tide scales, one painted on the outer face of Noire mole-head, another on the quai of St. Malo, near the entrance, and a third on the face of the jetty of St. Servan. The streams run with great strength during springs at the entrance of the Grande and Petite Conchee channels, the flood north-eastward, the ebb south-westward. Their rate is about 4 knots at half tide, across the Grand chenal de la Ranee until as far in as the Buron beacon turret. Southward of the Buron beacon turret the flood curves and sets into the river with the same velocity. The ebb from the river divides, one part running out by the Grand chenal, the other by the Decolle passage. Both streams take the direction of the latter passage and run at about the same rate, 3 to 4 knots. CHANNELS leading into the RANCE\u2014 All the channels leading into St. Malo are between Garde Guerin and Varde points, through the midst of the numberless dangers by which the coast is so thickly studded. These channels lead between rocks, some always above water and many others which uncover between a quarter ebb and low water, and amongst sand-banks and shoals, of which some are dry or nearly awash at low water, springs ; several small islets, however\u2014 such as Cezembre, described at page 114, Grande Conchee, Harbour isle, the Beys, and the higher rocks\u2014 serve as good marks by which these dangers may be avoided.

Entering by the Grande or Petite Porte channels, there are not less than from 4 to 5 fathoms at low water ; this entrance is, therefore, navigable at all times by vessels of deep draught. Besides this channel there are five others through which pilots take vessels with a proper rise of tide ; they are, the Decolle, close to the land south-westward of the Grande Porte ; the Petite and Grande Conchee ; the Petits Pointus ; and, the Bigne. The four last are all eastward of the ile de Cezembre. With easterly winds, pilots prefer entering the Ranee by the Conchee, in preference to the Grande or Petite Porte channels, the eddies with these winds not being so violent in the Conchee as in the other channels. DECOLLE PASSAGE lies close along shore westward of the entrance to the Ranee, from Dinard point to Decolle point, on which latter is a Semaphore ; it can be navigated by vessels of moderate draught from half flood to half ebb ; in case of need, those of deep draught may use it with a leading wind, at springs, from one hour before until one hour after high water. Pilots prefer this channel with an off-shore wind, as the sea is then smooth ; its limits are defined by beacons on rocks, nearly all of which cover at high water, springs, and its western entrance is between Decolle point and the Mouilliere rock where its breadth does not exceed half a cable. Directions. \u2014 Vessels entering the Decolle passage from the westward generally pass between Agot, a high and narrow islet about one mile westward of Garde Guerin point, and Nerput, a high isolated rock which uncovers 40 feet, 8 cables northward of that point, and on which is a red beacon turret 13 feet above high water. This entrance has the advantage of being directly with the tide, but in stormy weather it cannot always be taken, as breakers sometimes extend completely across' the pass between Decolle point and La Mouilliere. Mole des Noires lighthouse just open northward of the high rocks at the extreme of Decolle point E.S.E., leads between the Nerput rock and the Grande Brousse bank, on which there are only 11 feet water (but at the time of tide when this passage is navigable there are at least 30 feet over it), and l\\ cables northward of the See chart, No. 2,700."], [152, "124 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE.

Keep this mark on until the steeple of St. Hydeuc church is on with the summit of the Grand Buzard E. | S., which leads in the deepest part through the western entrance of the passage, about 150 yards southward of the red beacon on the Mouilliere rock ; if the Grand Buzard is covered, keep Parame church and St. Hydeuc windmill in sight between Fort Royal and Harbour isle, with the church the same distance northward of the fort as the mill appears southward of the isle. Having passed these narrows, proceeding with La Latte fort on with the Nerput NW. by W. \\ W., or with the southern mill of Talard, white, twice its width open northward of the Mole des Noires lighthouse and on with the end of the white mark on the Mole, the vessel may run eastward between the Petit Buzard and Petit Genillet rocks and between the Mouille and Rochardien rocks, all of which have beacons, and, when near the latter, the dome of St. Servan church will be seen between the two chimneys of the house in fort La Cite, which from thence is the leading mark until the maregraphe at point Bechard is on with a little clump of trees between points Corbiere and Aiguille, or until the highest of the Cheminees rocks is on with the cleft in the Mouille rock, either of which marks leads into the fairway of the river between the Pierres d'Amourette and the Roches Bonnes, and between the Pourceaux rocks and Mi-Maree rock off Dinard point, all of which rocks are also marked by beacons. If the tide is low, the dome of St. Servan church will not be visible, but only the standard of the lightning conductor on its summit. The Mouille rock is at the western end of the Pourceaux bank, and it uncovers 39 feet at the lowest tides ; when it is more than 3 feet above water, a vessel must pass between Dinard point and the Pourceaux rocks by the directions just given, but when the Mouille is covered, or is less than 3 feet out of water, vessels of considerable draught may run across the bank between that rock and the Pierres d'Amourette rocks, there being then at least 4 fathoms over it. To cross the bank, steer E. by S. with the mound on Garde Guerin point, seen over the land of Decolle point, well open northward of the Grand Vide rock, which never covers ; this mark leads up to St. Malo road, where vessels generally anchor until there is sufficient water to enter the port.

Vessels often pass northward of the Nerput rock and enter the Decolle passage either by running between the beacons on the Mouilliere and Petit Pot-de-Beurre rocks, or by passing close eastward of the beacon on the latter. Either of these channels has the disadvantage of a beam tide, but the former has a good depth of water and is nearly a cable wide. To steer through it, keep well northward of the Nerput, and bring the white marks of Roche Pelee and Pival in line bearing S.S.E. | E. ; this leads through the centre of the channel up to the leading marks already given for the Decolle passage, leaving on the starboard hand at 4 cables a 19-feet patch named Rat du Nord-Est, at nearly one cable the Basses des Marechaux, and at 70 or 80 yards the outlying rocks of the Mouilliere. On the port hand, it passes 120 yards from the Sauts-aux-Chiens, 100 yards from the Grande Basse, and close past some rocks awash at low water extending more than a cable south-westward from the beacon on the Petit Pot-de-Beurre. To pass over the reefs and eastward of the Petit Pot-de-Beurre, bring St. Enogat mill on with the northern extreme of the little patch of white sand just westward of Pelee point S.E. by S. ; this mark leads over the Sauts-aux-Chiens, a rocky patch on which there are 10 feet at low water and from 30 to 36 feet at half flood, and half a cable eastward of the Petit Pot-de-Beurre beacon. When this beacon is passed, haul a little southward to enter the Decolle passage and to avoid a small rock which uncovers 4 feet a cable southward of the Grand Pot-de-Beurre. As soon as the leading marks for the Decolle passage come on, proceed as before directed. From St. Malo road to Solidor road.\u2014 When southward of the plateau de la Ranee, the two principal dangers to be avoided between St. Malo and Solidor roads are the Rat de la Merciere and the Merciere ridge ; the former is a small isolated rock, with only 4 feet water, in mid-channel NW. \\ N. 3^ cables from Bechard point ; when the Pourceaux rocks are covered there are 17 feet on this danger, and 22 feet when the tide reaches the foot of the Pierres d'Amourette beacon.

At neap tides, vessels bound to Solidor road may pass on either side of the Rat de la Merciere ; but, at springs, they should keep as much as possible over towards the eastern bank of the river, to avoid the strength of the tide, and pass eastward of the Rat. For this purpose, when abreast of St. Malo, keep the eastern head of the Bizeux rock and the Merciere beacon in one S. by E. \\ E. until the Mole des Noires lighthouse is on with St. Malo church ; then steer to pass 150 yards westward and southward of the Merciere beacon. In case of necessity only, a vessel may run between the Merciere beacon and La Cite peninsula by keeping the Mole des Noires light house on with the north-western side of the Calfats rock ; but the tides run strongly in this passage, which is only 130 yards wide and has a depth of 13 feet at low water. On account of the eddy during the flood occasioned by Bechard point, the most favourable time for entering Solidor road is at high water. Vessels entering before that time, when rounding Bechard point and for the space of about a cable East and West, experience the flood stream setting with great velocity south-westward, and the eddy, not less strong, setting north-westward. The eddy begins to be felt near the shore about 2 hours before high water, and its breadth and strength increase as the tide rises. To enter the road, Grand Larron tower on with that of Solidor leads between Bechard point and the Solidor bank ; when within the latter, anchor as convenient ; but, to take up a safe berth, the services of a pilot are necessary. GRAND CHENAL DE LA RANCE\u2014 Grande and Petite Porte channels. \u2014 The Grande and Petite Porte channels are the only passages into the Ranee navigable at low water. They are westward of Cezembre island, are divided from each other by the Pierres des Portes and other rocks, and unite between the Grand Jardin and the Pierres de la Savatte, at the entrance of the Grand chenal de la Ranee ; they may be used by vessels of the deepest draught at all times- ; no large square-rigged vessel, however, should attempt either channel except with a leading wind of sufficient strength to enable her to keep the leading marks on and to stem the tide, bearing in mind that the course when within the narrows is about S.E. by S.

GRAND CHENAL de la RANCE is Z\\ miles long from the Grand Jardin to St. Malo road. It is bounded on the western side by the Pierres de la Savatte ; by the Pierre Salee flats, which have from 3 to 12 feet on them ; by the Buron, an isolated conical rock which uncovers 24 feet and has on it a red beacon turret surmounted by a ball ; and, by scattered rocky heads as far up as the Pourceaux rocks. On the eastern side, it is bounded by the off-lying rocks of the Grand Jardin ; by the Pierres Gamier, of which the highest head uncovers 5 feet ; and, by the rocky beads on the western slope of the Ouvras ridge, of which the greater part uncover at low water. The narrowest part of this channel is between the Basse du Buron, a small rocky head with only 3 feet, and the Buron rock ; they bear E. by N. \\ N. and W. by S. \\ S. from each other, and are 1^ cables apart.

When nearing Grand Jardin lighthouse, alter course just before Anse des Sablons lighthouse comes on with Balue light-tower, and then proceed with these objects in line S.E. by S. This course leads close past the edge of the 3-fathoms spur off the south-western end of Grand Jardin ; about 90 yards eastward of the Traversaine bank ; close to the edge of Pierre Salee flats ; and, from thence, in mid channel between the red beacon turret on the Buron rock and the black buoys on the edge of the Ouvras, to the Rade de St. Malo. By night, the same directions apply by using the lights. Or, when within 2 cables of Grand Jardin lighthouse, bring the Seminaire or college of St. Servan open about half the apparent breadth of its front eastward of the eastern angle of La Cite citadel S.E. by S. ; this leads 100 yards north-eastward of the Traversaine and of the Pierre Salee flats, and 150 yards eastward of the Buron rock beacon turret. At low water, care is necessary to avoid the 18-feet spur extending 80 or 90 yards south-westward of the Grand Jardin beacon, which may be done by keeping the leading mark slightly open until the beacon opens northward of the mound, then keep the fairway mark again. A vessel is eastward of the Traversaine bank when St. Lunaire mill is its own length westward of tbe Haumet rock. The Grande Porte channel may be entered between the Buharats and the Pierres des Portes, and, with a leading wind, this route is the best at low water ; the leading mark is the steeple of St. Enogat church on with the eastern side of Haumet rock S. by E.

The face of the mill as well as the south-eastern angle of Fort Royal are whitewashed, in order to be easily recognised at a distance. A good mark for passing between the Traversaine and tht Pierres de la Savatte is the Buron red beacon turret on with Anse des Sablons lighthouse S.E. by S., but this line must be quitted when past the Traversaine bank as it leads over the Salee flats.

For this purpose, when approaching the entrance, bring the western end of Cezembre island on with the centre of the town of St. Malo, and, when within 2 miles of the island, steer to the southward to bring Grand Jardin and Balue lighthouses in line S.E. by S. ; this leads between the Grande Hupee and the Rat des Courtis and northward of the Basse Nord-Est des Portes ; when within 2 cables of the lighthouse, steer to round the Grand Jardin and proceed as before directed. Grand Jardin lighthouse on with Jeannet windmill S. by W. W. leads between the Bunel rock and the shoals 2 cables westward of the western end of Cezembre ; but, in using this channel, a vessel must edge away to the South-west to round the Grand Jardin as soon as either Parame or St. Hydeuc church steeples open of the south-western point of Cezembre. The PETITE CONCHEE CHANNEL is only practicable for vessels of deep draught between half flood and half ebb. Its entrance is 2 cables eastward of the Petite Conchee rock, between the Rousse and Ronfleresse rocks, where the channel is less than a cable wide. The Petite Conchee is the only rock between Cezembre island and Grande Conchee that does not cover at springs ; the Rousse uncovers 33 feet, and the Ronfleresse 28^ feet. Directions. \u2014 The western side of Petit Bey fort seen between La Cite citadel and the little fort on Bechard point S. \u00a3 E. leads through the Petite Conchee channel nearly up to the Crapauds du Bey rocks, leaving the Rousse, the Rats, and the Queue des Rats westward ; and the Ronfleresse, the Pierres aux Normands, and the Roches aux Anglais eastward. A red beacon, on a rock which dries 12 feet, marks the centre of the Pierres aux Normands ; and, near the northern end of the Roches aux Anglais is a red beacon on a rock which uncovers 11 feet ; the south-eastern part of this latter reef is also marked by a red buoy moored within its edge.

GRANDE CONCHEE CHANNEL derives its name from the Grande Conchee rock, and, like that of the Petite Conchee, can only be entered by vessels of moderate size between half flood and half ebb, and is chiefly used by those from the north-eastward. The shallowest part, as with all the channels eastward of Cezembre, is that over the flats in front of Grand and Petit Bey forts, where there are only 2 or 3 feet on the leading line at dead low water. The entrance is bounded on its western side by the Haies de la Conchee, the Rimponiere, and the Grande Conchee ; and, on its eastern side, by the Rousses and the Plate ; its position may be recognised by Grande Conchee fort, which may be seen from a great distance. Haies de la Conchee, Rousses, and Plate rocks- Beacon turret. \u2014 The Haies de la Conchee, 3 cables northward of Grande Conchee fort, is a ridge of high rocks whose summits do not cover. The Rimponiere between the Haies de la Conchee and Grande Conchee, dries 36 feet. The Rousses are rocks, of which one isolated head has only 6 feet water ; the marks for it are, the Grand Chevreuil, a high rock near the shore westward of Meinga point, on which stands a kiosk, making it very conspicuous against the land, a little open southward of the guard-house on the inner part of Meinga point ; and, Roche mill on with the eastern gable of the barracks of Petit Bey fort S. by W. f W. The Plate, half a mile S.E. from Grande Conchee, uncovers 18 feet, and has on it a stone beacon turret 10 feet above the highest tides, painted in red and black bands.

Buoy. \u2014 The Bouton rock is marked by a red and black buoy moored about 50 yards southward of it. Several other patches are scattered about the entrance to this channel ; the most dangerous are, the Becfer, the St. Servantine, and the Rat de St. Servan. The Basse de Becfer, with 15 feet water, lies North 2| cables from the two north-westernmost heads of the Haies de la Conchee. The Basse de la Conchee, with 22 feet, bears N.E. N. 8 cables from Grande Conchee fort. The Rat de St. Servan with 12 feet, least water, lies E. by N. 6| cables, and the Teto, with 17 feet, the same distance E. \\ S. from the Grande Conchee fort. The Rat du Rocher, with 15 feet, is one mile distant E. \u00a7 N. from Grande Conchee fort. St. Servantine is a dangerous isolated rock, which uncovers 2 feet at the lowest tides ; the marks for it are, the summit of the Ronfleresse rock on with the foot of Garde Guerin point W.S.W. ; and, St. Hydeuc steeple on with a mill about 800 yards southward of it. Bell-buoy.\u2014 A red bell-buoy is moored about 50 yards south eastward of the St. Servantine rock. As a guide to the depth of water over these shoals, it is useful to know that when the Ronfleresse is covered there are at least 25 feet over the St. Servantine ; and, that when the rock on which the Plate beacon turret stands is covered, there are 30 feet over the Rat de St. Servan, 33 feet over the Rat du Rocher, and 34 feet over the Teto rock. Directions. \u2014 When running for the Grande Conchee channel from the eastward, be careful to keep the mound on Garde Guerin point open northward of the Petite Conchee S.W. by W. f W. to pass northward of the Basse des Pointus which has 18 feet water, the St. Servantine, and the Rousses. The leading mark to enter the channel is, Mole des Noires light house touching the eastern side of Grand Bey island S. | W. ; this mark leads If cables eastward of Grande Conchee fort and 2| cables westward of the Plate beacon turret.

When the western head of the Bizeux is on with the high rock at the foot of Bechard point, steer with these two rocks in line for St. Malo road as before directed. A vessel may, if necessary, pass southward of the Crapauds du Bey rocks by keeping Jeannet mill exactly on with St. Enogat church. A good leading mark for the Grande Conchee channel from the offing, and one easily recognised, is, the south-western corner of La Cite on with the middle of Grand Bey islet S. by W. \\ W. This mark, in entering the channel, leads rather close past the sunken dangers on its eastern side. At night, in clear weather, vessels may enter by the Grande Conchee channel ; Grand Jardin light kept opening and shutting in with the southern side of Cezembre island leads northward of the St. Servantine up to the entrance ; then, with the Mole des Noires light opening and shutting in with the eastern side of Grand Bey, steer up the channel. When the high point of Dinard is still a little open westward of the Petit Bey, haul sharply to the westward to pass between the Roches aux Anglais and the Crapauds, observing that when Mole des Noires light, after having been masked by Grand Bey, re-opens, and is about to be again masked by Petit Bey, the vessel is nearly on the line of the Crapauds ; and, that when the light re-opens westward of Petit Bey, she is westward of them and may bear up S.S.W. to enter the eastern limit of the Anse de Sablons green light, and then steer for the anchorage in St. Malo roads.

This channel, as well as all those eastward of Cezembre island, is only practicable for vessels of moderate draught between half flood and half ebb. Directions. \u2014 Vessels from the eastward entering by the Petits Pointus channel, when westward of the Basse Grune, should steer with the mound on Garde Guerin point on with Grande Conchee fort W.S.W. ; this leads between the Grands Pointus and Basse des Pointus. Having arrived within half a mile of the St. Servantine red bell buoy, haul to the southward to bring on the leading mark for the channel just given, viz., Petit Bey fort a little open southward of the guard-house on Dinard point S.W.

By following the leading mark given, a vessel passes a cable westward of the Basse Tangui, 150 yards westward of the beacon on the Petits Pointus, and 1\\ cables westward of the Letrun d'Aval. The BIGNE CHANNEL is named after the Bigne rock, 7 cables north-eastward of Varde point, and the highest rock in the vicinity See chart, No. 2,700. I SO 11886"], [164, "[Chap. IV. 136 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. of that point, its summit being 32 feet above the highest tides.

At neaps, it may be used by vessels drawing not more than 10 feet at all times of tide. ROCHEFORT ROCK. \u2014 Beacon turret. \u2014 The Rochefort rock lies \\\\ miles north-westward of Meinga point, and, with the Platier ledge which dries 3 feet, forms a rocky group 2| cables long E.N.E. and W.S.W., and one cable wide. The highest head of the Rochefort shows at about 2 hours ebb, uncovers 34 feet at the lowest tides, and does not cover at neaps. On it stands a beacon turret 13 feet above high water, painted in red and black bands, and surmounted by a ball. The marks for it are, the guard-house on the summit of Varde point, its own breadth open westward of the Bigne S.W. by S., and St. Vincent belvedere on with the western bluff of Benard point S. \u00a3 E. The mound on Garde Guerin point open northward of Grande Conchee leads northward of the Rochefort ; and, Parame church on with the Bigne leads westward. Directions. \u2014 In steering for the entrance of the Bigne channel between the Tintiaux group, north-eastward of Meinga point, and the Rochefort rock, bring the Crolante rock, which lies at the foot of Varde point and uncovers 38 feet, on with the western side of Grand Bey fort S.W. by W. \\ W. Run in on this line until the Bigne rock bears N.E. by N., or until St. Lunaire mill is on with Bellefard point W. by S. \\ S., when keep it so until St. Jeannet mill opens northward of St. Enogat steeple ; then proceed as before. The first mark leads a cable south-eastward of the Basse aux Chiens, which lies half a mile south-eastward of the Rochefort and uncovers 3 feet ; about the same distance from the Basse du Durand, lying 6 cables southward of the Rochefort with only one foot water ; and, about 100 yards south-eastward of the Petite Bigne, marked by a red beacon at its eastern end. On the other hand, it leads within half a cable of the reef extending from the Durand, of which some rocks dry 12 feet ; and, at a greater distance outside the Aiguillon and Graine-de-Lin rocks, the former uncovering 21 feet, the latter L2 feet. The second mark leads a cable northward of the Crolante and of the Cancalaise, a little rocky ridge which uncovers 9 feet \u2022 See chart, No. 2,700,"], [165, "Chap.

The third mark leads northward of the Crapauds du Bey as on entering by the Grande Conchee or Petits Pointus channels, but leads very close to the rock awash north eastward of the Petit Dodehal. It is useful to know that when the Petite Bigne covers, there are more than 19 feet over the tail of the shoal extending northward from Grand Bey fert, which is the shoalest part of this channel. Vessels sometimes enter the Bigne channel with St. Malo church on with the Bigne rock about S.W. W., and run in on the eastern side of the Rochefort until within 2\\ cables of the Bigne, then edge away southward, to round the Petite Bigne at a safe distance, and then bring on the leading marks already given, and proceed as before. The tides in this channel between St. Malo and Varde point never have much strength ; they run strongly, however, north-eastward of that point. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 To St. Malo from the West- ward. \u2014 When bound to St. Malo from the westward, with southerly winds, Ushant and the French coast may be kept aboard ; but, with northerly winds and at night, a prudent distance should be main tained off-shore until the Sept-iles and Heaux lights are made out. With the assistance of these lights, a position may be obtained about 4 miles northward of the Heaux, from whence a S.E. \\ E. course for about 33 miles, following the directions at page 64, leads north ward of the Roc'h-ar-Bel and Horaine ledge, and crosses- the meridian of cape Frehel about 6 miles northward of the cape. The vessel is then in a good position to run for the entrance of the Ranee through the Decolle passage or Grande Porte channel, according to the state of wind and tide. This route may be followed either with the flood or against the ebb with the wind from N.N.E. round by West to South, but if between S.W. and South it is better to give cape Frehel a closer berth. With a fresh leading wind, a sailing vessel passing the meridian of Heaux lighthouse at the commencement of the flood, or 5 hours before high water at St. Malo, should enter the Ranee by high water, the distance being about 43 miles ; but, with a foul wind, it takes two flood tides to make the passage. With a head wind, make short tacks in sight of Heaux lighthouse until the commencement of the flood, then stretch into the channel See charts, Nos. 2,700 and 2,669 h. I 2 SO 11886"], [166, "[Chap. IV. 138 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. between the Barnouic and Roc'h-ar-Bel. The boards in this channel should not exceed 2 miles in length, but when eastward of the Horaine they may be extended to 7 or 8 miles. By following these directions, cape Frehel should be made towards the latter part of the flood, and the vessel may anchor or make short tacks under shelter of the cape during the ebb ; or, if not so far to windward, she may anchor in the rade d'Erqui, see page 102, weigh again when the flood makes, and work up so as to reach, if possible by about half flood, one of the entrance channels to the Ranee. To St. Malo through Grand Ruet passage.\u2014 The channel between the Roches-Douvres on the West, and Guernsey, Jersey, and the Minquiers ledge on the East, called by the French pilots the Grand Ruet, would seem from its great breadth to offer a safe and easy route to St. Malo or Granville ; the streams, however, run through and across it with such velocity at springs, that, during westerly winds, with stream and wind in the same direction, a sailing vessel runs great risk of being drifted between the islands and dangers in their vicinity ; and, if surprised by fog or night, the danger is imminent, the constant changes in the set of the stream making the dead reckon ing unreliable ; see Tide table, page 60. At springs, with a westerly wind and flood tide, ships should keep well to the westward, make the coast of France about the Sept-iles, and proceed southward of the Barnouic ledge, as already described ; but, at neaps, with a steady northerly wind irrespective of tide, or, at springs, with an ebb tide and a westerly wind, a vessel may use this channel with due care as follows : \u2014 With a steady westerly wind, and being about 8 miles W.S.W. of Hanois light, off the western end of Guernsey, at the commencement of the ebb stream or 2,\\ hours after high water at St. Malo, steer S. | E. for about 38 miles, or until within 6 or 8 miles N.N.W. of cape' Frehel, when St. Malo may be steered for as before directed. This course leads about 4 miles eastward of the Roches-Douvres, and its lighthouse should be sighted to correct the reckoning ; 6 miles eastward of the Barnouic ledge ; and, about 8 miles westward of the Minquiers. During nearly the whole of this run, the wind being on the starboard side counteracts the effect of the stream, which, for the first four hours will be on the port beam, the fifth hour a little on the bow, and at last on the starboard beam, the flood beginning earlier as the French coast is neared.

To St. Malo through the Deroute passage.- The shortest and best route from cape de la Hague to St. Malo, with fresh leading winds, is through the Race of Alderney, see pages 386-388, and between Jersey and Serk through the Deroute passage see page 298, the dis tance being about 75 miles ; it should not be used, however, by strangers at night during light winds or in thick weather. To take this route under the most advantageous circumstances, endeavour to enter Alderney Race on the slack or last of the north eastern stream, which is about 4 hours after high water at St. Malo. Having cleared the Race, steer about S.W. to enter the Deroute passage in mid-channel, and to ensure passing south-eastward of the Blanchard rock. This distance being run in about 2^ or 3 hours, or about the time of low water at St. Malo, continue the course so as to be in a good position westward of the meridian ot the Minquiers at the first of the flood. This stream is felt more as the vessel advances southward ; it is therefore most necessary to determine by correct bearings the course to'be steered, and to pay strict attention to the directions given at page 160, in passing those dangers. When clear of the Minquiers, steer for cape Frehel where pilots are always on the look out. To St. Malo through the Cotentin passage. \u2014 I ull directions are given at pages 214-220 for this passage when bound to Granville ; the same directions should be followed for St. Malo until the vessel has arrived within 4 or 5 miles of the beacon turret on the Etat, a remarkable rock on the northern edge of the Chausey group, which group is described in the following chapter, whim she should keep to the westward so as to round the north-western part of the group about 1^ miles distant. When abreast of the Rondes de l'Ouest, a rocky ridge forming the western end of the group, steer S.W. or more southerly, keeping within 3 miles of the rocks until the ruins of the old castle on Grande ile open southward of the Corbiere, the high and remarkable rock at the south-western extreme of the Chausey group, on an E. by S. h S. bearing ; then steer about S.W. \\ S. for one of the channels into the Ranee. Great care must be taken to make proper allowance for the set of the tidal stream, which, in clear weather, can easily be done by frequent bearings ot objects on the Chausey isles. At night, when Chausey light is sighted, steer for it on a S.W. | S. bearing until within about 2 miles of the Chausey group, See charts, Nos. 2,669 n and b."], [168, "140 CAPE FREHEL TO GRANVILLE. [Chap. IV. when Granville light should bear S.S.E. \\ E. ; then keep to the westward so as to round the rocks at that distance. When abreast of the western end of the group, haul to the southward, taking care not to approach the rocks within 2 miles ; and, if the night is clear, by the time Chausey light bears E. by N. both the Herpin and Grand Jardin lights will be in sight. By the aid of these two, and of the St. Malo leading lights, the port may be entered at once by the directions already given ; or, if preferred, a position may be main tained off the port to await daylight. From St. Malo through Cotentin passage. \u2014 Vessels leaving St. Malo and intending to take this route, should so time their departure as to enable them to enter the Cotentin passage with the first of the north-eastern stream, which makes 3| hours before high water at St. Malo. From one mile northward of the Grande Conchee, steer about N.E. | E. ; this line passes about 2 miles north-westward of the Rochefort beacon turret, and 4 miles south-eastward of the Sauvages, due allowance being made for tide. When within 3 or 4 miles of the Corbiere rock, steer to pass about 1 \\ miles westward of the Rondes de l'Ouest and clear of Corbiere bank. Round the north-western end of the group at the same distance, passing about 2 miles south-east ward of the Ardentes ; and, when Gros-Mont Semaphore is on with the Enseigne beacon tower S. f W. steer to the eastward to bring the Etat and Huguenans beacon towers in line S. by W. westerly ; this mark on astern leads northward between the Shamrock knoll and Basse le Marie, when follow the directions given at page 218. If after the first quarter flood, and unable to weather the western end of the Chausey group, bear up and pass round the eastern end, where, by that time, there will be a good rise of tide over the numerous shallow patches by which that part of the channel is encumbered, sei pages 177-179. Granville church on with the northernmost chimney of the south-western barrack keeps a vessel 5 cables northward of the Videcoq rock, marked by a red and black ball-buoy ; and, Coutances cathedral on with Mont Martin church N.E. by E. leads between the Haguet and Admiralty banks, but over and amongst patches with as little as 3 feet at low water, springs, when southward of the latter.

A vessel averaging 7 knots should reach the middle of this passage in 6 hours after leaving St. Malo, and from thence, steering for the Race with a fresh fair wind, may stem the remainder of the south western stream. The Race would then be entered a little after the commencement of the north-eastern stream. French coasters generally adopt this route, and to ensure entering the Race on the slack or last of the south-western stream, they sometimes wait for a leading wind at anchor under the ile des Ehbiens. ROTENEUF.\u2014 This little harbour, about 4 miles eastward of St. Malo and midway between Varde and Meinga points, has a narrow entrance but opens out into a space about three quarters of a mile wide and half a mile deep, but it is choked with sand, over which the tide only begins to rise at half flood ; the approach also is rendered dangerous by several rocks which cover. Vessels of 15 or 16 feet draught may beach within it at high water, springs, but they must keep within 50 yards of Benard point, the high bluff eastern point of entrance, when passing it. Vessels ground and lay up for the winter in the creek eastward of this point, where the bottom is everywhere of sand and the shelter excellent. A remarkable tree open eastward of a large house leads up to the entrance of the harbour, passing eastward of the Rochefort and westward of the Hautieux and Guimereux rocks ; the Hautieux uncover 25 feet, the Guimereux, lying between the Hautieux and Benard point, 23 feet.

It has only 16 feet water, with from 9 to 10 fathoms round it, and should be carefully avoided at low water by vessels of deep draught, as also by small craft when it blows hard as it then causes a dangerous swell. The marks for the Rault are, the mound on Garde Guerin point a little open southward of the Rochefort beacon turret W. by S. f S. ; and, the eastern slope of Meinga point almost shutting in Terquete belvedere. The mound on Garde Guerin point on with Grande Conchee fort W.S.W. leads northward ; and, Mont St. Michel on with the Herpin rock S.E. \\ E. leads well north-eastward of it. Basse Grune is a dangerous isolated rock, with only 7 feet on it and from 10 to 12 fathoms close around, lying NW.

In moderate weather, vessels of any draught may pass between the Grune and the Nid at all times by keeping Mont St. Michel on with the Herpin rock bearing S.E. i E.

When the Pierre de Herpin rock, on which the lighthouse stands, is covered, there are at least 37 feet water over the Grune, and 46 feet over both the Rault and Nid. The TINTIAUX are a group of rocks about 1^ miles long E.S E. and W.N.W., and half a mile wide, their western end lying 4 cables north-eastward of Meinga point ; most of the rocks appear at 4 hours ebb, and the highest, near the centre of the group, dry about 30 feet at low water, springs, and do not cover at neaps. Rochefort beacon turret on with cape Frehel lighthouse, or on with Grande Conchee fort, leads northward ; and, Duguesclin fort bearing S.S.W., or Haut-Bout eastern mill on with the guard-house on Verger point, the eastern point of the first sandy beach westward of Grouin point, leads eastward. Tintiaux passage, between the Tintiaux and the land, is used by coasting vessels with southerly winds ; the tide runs very strongly through it, but follows the direction of the channel. The leading mark when coming from the eastward is, the Bigne rock midway between Grand Jardin lighthouse and the south-western point of Cezembre isle W. \\ S. ; this leads 100 yards southward of all the Tintiaux, and between them and the northern rock of the Cadins, which dries 3 feet. Give Meinga point a berth of 2 J cables in passing, and then run out between the Tintiaux and the Basse aux Chiens, with St. Vincent belvedere, on the heights at the head of Roteneuf harbour, touching the eastern part of the high land of Benard ; or, if entering St. Malo, bring the leading marks on for the Bigne channel ; see page 136, if the tide is sufficiently high to take that channel. The Coast. \u2014 Meinga point, 3| miles westward of Grouin point, is very remarkable ; it is nearly as high as cape Frehel, is narrow and steep on all sides, and extends in a slope more than half a mile northward. Between it and Grouin point, the coast presents nothing worthy of notice with the exception of the small bay between Nez and Nid points, where, in its south-eastern part, is a sandjT beach defended by Fort Duguesclin.

POINTE de GROUIN, the western point of Mont St. Michel bay, is high, rocky, and precipitous on its north-western and south eastern sides, but forms a narrow slope towards the N.E. The sudden change in the direction of the coast at this point is very remarkable, and makes it easy of recognition at a great distance in the offing. Southward of the point are the two windmills of Haut- Bout. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station near the extreme of the point ; see page 12. North-westward of Grouin point and peninsula are many rocky patches from 5 cables to one mile from the shore ; and, on the northern side of one -of them, the Grande Bunouze, at about 4 cables northward of the point, is a small red buoy. On the eastern side of Grouin point, Landes island, with the Herpin, Pierre de Herpin, Fille rock, and a few shoal patches extending 2 miles eastward of the point, form a broken rocky barrier through which vessels pass when seeking shelter in Cancale road or in the anchorage off La Houle.

N.E. by some rocks then high above water and by others which are covered. Its direction is nearly parallel with the shore, from which it is separated by a channel called the Vieille Riviere, only 164 yards wide at its narrowest part, through which, at springs, the stream runs 6 knots. The eastern side is steep-to from end to end, there being from 18 to 20 feet water alongside the rocks. On the north-eastern part of the island are the ruins of a fort and guard-house. The Pignonet rock, with only 10J feet, lies in mid-channel between the north-eastern extreme of Landes island and the Herpin rock. The Herpin rock is a high pyramid rock about 66 feet above the level of high water, springs, and its base a cable in diameter at low water.

W. from 1 to 1^ miles ; the ground, however, so far out, is rather coarse. PIERRE de HERPIN.\u2014 The highest head of this small rocky ridge, on which stands the lighthouse, uncovers 32 feet, and bears N.E. by E. E. 8 cables from the Herpin rock. At springs, it begins to show at about one third ebb ; at neaps, it does not cover. Another rocky ridge, with from 22 to 24 feet water, lies S. by E. 2^ cables from the Pierre de Herpin. LIGHT. \u2014 From a circular lighthouse, 81 feet in height, on the Pierre de Herpin, at 61 feet above the level of high water, is exhibited a light showing fixed white for 30 seconds, and then five green flashes during the next 30 seconds. The light is visible 13 miles. From this lighthouse, cape Frehel light bears W. by N. 20 miles ; and, Granville light, pointe du Roc, E.N.E. 10 miles. The passage between the Pierre de Herpin and the Herpin rock, called the Grand Ruet, is the principal entrance to Cancale road from the North-west ; but, the Basse du Milieu, a shoal with only 4 feet W. \\ S. 2\u00a7 cables from the lighthouse, narrows the passage to 4 cables between it and the Herpin rock ; this passage is otherwise deep enough for vessels of any draught at all times. They should, however, pass within a cable of the Herpin on the flood, as this stream sets strongly over the Basse du Milieu and Pierre de Herpin ; the flood begins to make through the passage about 5f hours before high water at St. Malo or Granville, and as it runs S.E. and E.S.E. there is no danger of being drifted over the Banchets.

When the Pierre de Herpin covers, there are 19^- feet on the Fille, and a vessel is northward of both when Grouin point is open noi thward of the Herpin rock, and southward when the point is open southward of the Herpin. Cape Frehel on with the Herpin also leads southward. There are 8| fathoms in the passage between the Pierre de Herpin and the Fille, and it may be safely used by keeping from 1# to 2| cables from the lighthouse ; but, this passage places a vessel too much to leeward if seeking shelter from strong westerly winds in Cancale road. Bane des Renardieres, of from 6 to 7^ fathoms, sand and shells, bears N.N.W. W. If miles from the Herpin rock ; it is only a cable wide and 5 cables long N. by W. and S. by E., aud lying nearly across the streams it causes a heavy sea on a weather tide. From its shoalest part at the southern end, the fort near Varde point appears midway between Grand and Petit Chevreuil W. by S. | S. ; and, the Herpin rock is on with the north-eastern extreme of Pointe de Gogre, Mont St. Michel bay. South-eastward of Grouin point, between it and pointe de la Chaine, is the Grande rade de Cancale, already referred to and presently described. Besides the dangers extending eastward from Grouin point, of which the Fille rock is the most eastern, there are, on the western side of the road, the Bane de Chatry ; on the northern side, the Banchets shoal ; and, on the eastern and southern sides, the Brehaut, Corbieres, ile de Rimains, and other rocks in-shore, of which the principal are the Petit Rimains and the Chatellier, above water ; a large rock near Chaine point which uncovers 22 feet and is marked by a beacon ; and, the Thomen rock within low water mark off La Houle, marked by two beacons on its northern heads. Bane de Chatry runs parallel with the shore and bounds Cancale road on the West ; it has from 6 to 9 feet for a distance of 5 cables on its shoalest parts, and is joined to the coast at Chaine point by a bed of sand, over which there are 11 or 12 feet ; its northern end is abreast of a small creek named port Mer, leavin\u00b0 between it and the shallows extending from the shore the Fosse de See chart, No. 2,669 6."], [175, "Chap.

The BANCHETS.\u2014 This bank of sand and broken shells of from 10 to 24 feet water is in the fairway of the entrance to Cancale road, 3 cables northward of the Bane des Corbieres, and E.S.E. 7 cables from the old fort on Landes island ; together with the small knoll of 23^ feet at 2 cables on its north-western side, it is dangerous to vessels of deep draught at low water, springs. The bank is 5^ cables long N. by W. and S. by E. ; the shoalest parts form two small ridges parallel with each other, and athwart the direction of the streams. On the north-western ridge are 17 feet, and only 10 feet on the highest part of the other, near the eastern part of the bank. The marks for the 10-feet ridge are, the steep point of Chateau Richeux open 1\u00b0 eastward of Chaine point ; and, the slope of Grouin point open the same distance northward of the guard house on Landes island. The sand forming this bank is said not to shift, but there is reason to think that the depths often change during strong gales. The mark for the small knoll of 23^ feet water is, Haut-Bout eastern mill on with the northern point of port Mer bay.

From the northern end of this patch, the guard house on Chaine point is on with Cancale church steeple ; and, from the southern end, the steeple is between the Chatellier rock and Petit Rimains islet, which joins the northern end of that rock at low water. GRANDE RADE de CANCALE.\u2014 This excellent anchorage is northward of Rimains island, 7 cables from the shore between Chatry and Corbieres banks ; it affords good shelter for ships of deep draught during westerly winds. A vessel should moor North and South with open hawse to the westward, and the best holding-groun I is with the Cormorandiere rock seen between Rimains island and the Hubert rock ; its eastern limit is, the Cormorandiere touching the eastern side of the fort on Rimains ; and, its northern limit, Haut- Bout eastern mill on with the middle of Portz Picain, a small white sandy beach close southward of Chatry point. North-easterly winds sometimes cause a swell, but vessels are seldom obliged by sudden shifts of wind to quit this anchorage. There is also good holding ground in the southern part of the road in from 26 to 30 feet, clay and mud, about 2 cables eastward of Rimains island, with Cancale church steeple on with the middle of Rimains fort, and Grouin point a little open westward of Landes island. A vessel under 10 feet draught may anchor southward of Rimains island, with that island bearing North about 5 cables ; in running for this anchorage at low water, keep within 2^ cables of the island, to avoid the 10-feet patch on the Bane des Corbieres.

The anchoring ground extends southward from the line of Haut-Bout eastern mill on with Portz Picain to that of Cancale church steeple on with the southern side of the Chatellier rock. The best berth is in from 6 to 7 fathoms, blue tenacious clay, with Dol church steeple on with the foot of the eastern slope of Mont Dol ; and, Cancale church steeple between the Chatellier and the fort on Rimains. This position is 1\u00a3 miles outside Rimains island, but the Corbieres prevents a nearer approach, consequently that island affords but little shelter from the westward. Vessels remaining any length of time at this anchorage should sight their anchors occasionally, or they bury themselves deeply and are difficult to weigh. Merchant vessels generally prefer anchoring southward of the Bane des Corbieres, where the holding-ground is good and the depth from 19 to 22 feet. The best berth is close southward of the line of Haut-Bout eastern mill on with the Cormorandiere rock N.W. \u00a3 W, or with the mill between the fort and the northern point of Rimains island, but the safest position is in the southern part of Cancale road. Anchorage in Fosse de Chatry. \u2014 Vessels of moderate draught may anchor here in from 26 to 32 feet, with Haut-Bout eastern mill on with Portz Picain ; and, Mont Dol on with the eastern point of Petit Rimains, the little island just northward of the Chatellier rock. This is a good anchorage during neaps, but, at springs, the streams run from 4 to 5 knots. Small craft may anchor a little more in shore, but not westward of the line of Mont Dol touching the western side of the Chatellier. Vessels that can take the ground are well sheltered with the wind from N.E. round by North and West to S.S.W. on the deposit of soft mud which borders the northern part of the little bay of port Mer.

The port has a large fishing industry and valuable oyster beds ; its trade otherwise is insignificant. Its beaching places westward of the Fenetre are good and safe for small craft. The town of Cancale stands on the cliffs and La Houle at their feet ; their united population is about 7,000. St. Malo is about 8 miles distant by road. Directions. \u2014 When running from the westward for Cancale road from a position about 2 miles N.N.E. from Cezembre island, steer E. by N., keeping the mound on Garde Guerin point open northward of Grande Conchee fort, until Mont St. Michel opens of Grouin point ; then haul up for it, and keep the Mont on with the Herpin rock bearing S.E. \\ E. ; this leads between the Grune and Nid shoals. When within about 5 cables of the Herpin rock, steer through the Grand Ruet, passing only a cable eastward of the rock if the flood is running, as that stream sets strongly over the Basse du Milieu and Pierre de Herpin ; and, from thence, haul to the southward for the road. ... The passages between Grouin point and Landes island, called the Petit Ruet, and that between the north-eastern extreme of Landes island and the Herpin are too dangerous to attempt without a pilot. BAIE DU MONT ST. MICHEL, between Grouin and Champeaux points which bear E. \\ S. and W. N. from each other distant 10s miles, is much exposed to north-westerly and northerly winds ; the anchorages, however, off Cancale and La Houle in the north-western part of the bay, as just described, afford excellent shelter against westerly winds. .The head of the bay falls back a great distance south-eastward ; nearly three fourths of it is occupied by an immense bank of sand which dries at low water, and a large portion does not cover at high water, neaps. The Coast. \u2014 On the western side of the bay the land is high for the space of 4 miles from Grouin to Chateau Richeux point, and the coast generally steep. The low lands called the marsh of Dol, begin at Chateau Richeux point and extend 15 miles eastward to the mouth of the river Couesnon, the course of which separates the See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [179, "Chap. IV.] BAIE DU MONT ST. MICHEL. 151 department of fie-et-Vilaine from that of La Manche. A strong dyke protects this marsh from the invasion of the sea, its surface being in several places below the level of high spring tides. The only remarkable rise on this part of the coast is the small isolated hill named Mont Dol, and a chain of hills, which, seen from the northward, seem to form a long promontory, of which the western extreme is known locally as point de Gogre. Mont Dol rises from the midst of the marsh land 6 miles south-eastward of Chateau Richeux point, and, on its flat top stands a windmill, a Semaphore, and a few cottages. Point de Gogre is the nearest point to the sea of the; chain of hills about three quarters of a mile inland between Mont Dol and the river Couesnon. The little harbour of Vivier is at the mouth of the river Guyoul, S. \\ E. about 7| miles from Grouin point ; it can only be entered by the smallest coasters having good pilots. Mont Dol Semaphore bearing S. f W. leads up to it. There is a small quay, alongside of which vessels lie to load or unload. Small vessels can ascend the river Couesnon, at springs, as far as the town of Pontorson, but the navigation is difficult and seldom attempted. The entrance channel through the sands commences at the western foot of Mont St. Michel. Mont St. Michel and Tombelaine islet, rising from the sands in the eastern part of the bay, form by far the most remarkable objects on this part of the coast. Mont St. Michel is a pyramidal block of granite 4 cables in diameter, which at the highest tides is completely surrounded, but from which at low water the sea recedes to a great distance, leaving dry sands for about 6 miles. Its summit is surmounted by large buildings and an ancient abbey church, of which the steeples are 420 feet above the level of the beach. It bears S. E. nearly 7 miles from Champeaux point, and in appearance strongly resembles Mount St. Michael in Cornwall. Harbour lights. \u2014 On the western side of Mont St. Michel, from the Gabriel watch tower, at 41 feet above high water and 54 feet above the ground, is exhibited a fixed red light visible 6 miles. It is shown only from 2 hours before high water until one hour after. See chart, No. 2,669 b. K SO 11886"], [180, "[Chap. IV. 152 CHAMPEAUX POINT. A fixed green light is shown from the eastern point of entrance to the Couesnon river, about 1,100 yards from the Mont. This light ie maintained by fishermen and is not exhibited unless a vessel is expected. The two lights indicate the direction of the chenal de Couesnon. The Tombelaine is a barren islet almost as large as Mont St. Michel but much lower. It bears N. by E. \\ E. If miles from the Mont, and, when seen from the northward or southward, has the appearance of a crushed pyramid inclining to the eastward. A deep sandy bight lies eastward of Mont St. Michel and Tombelaine, from the northern shore of which Tombelaine is distant 1\\ miles. The shore from thence continues very low for about 3 miles farther northward, until near Champeaux point, when it begins to rise. CHAMPEAUX POINT is the eastern point of Mont St. Michel bay ; from it, pointe du Roc, Granville, bears North 5f miles. It is a bluff and almost perpendicular headland, unapproachable from seaward on account of the broad slate which dry out a long waSy from the shore, but very useful as a landmark, especially for vessels navigating between Chausey and Granville, or bound northward by the Cotentin channel. Between Champeaux point and Granville the coast curves slightly to the eastward and is generally of moderate height ; but, in some places it is low, sandy aud dangerous to approach with westerly winds, being bordered by a sand-bank interspersed with flat rocks, which extend a mile from tbe shore. As Granville is approached, tkese dangers become more marked, but, as they especially concern the pJkrtage of that port, a full description of them is given in the next chapter.

Cape de la Hague - Before proceeding to a description of Granville and the adjacent coast, it will be well to give a detailed account of the vast beds of rocks and islets in the offing, which, in conjunction with the Channel islands to the northward, render the navigation and all approach to the ports on this coast so exceptionally dangerous. PLATEAU des MINQUIERS, situated 9 miles southward of Jersey, and 13 miles from the nearest French land both southward and eastward of it, is a tangled mass of reefs 1 6 miles long East and West, by 8 miles wide. The most dangerous part occupies a space near the middle, about 7 miles long East and West, by 4 miles wide. The masses of rock at this part lie closer together in ridges and are higher, a large number being generally awash at high water ; only a few scattered rocks rise from 10 to 20 feet above that level. These rocky groups are generally connected by extensive banks of shingle, gravel, and sand. There are, however, some narrow tortuous channels through this part of the reef, but from the strength of the tides and absence of good marks, those available being mostly so distant as to be useful only in the clearest weather, the pilotage is too difficult for any but the fishermen and passenger steamers plying between St. Helier's and St. Malo, by whom they are frequented. The whole of the sunken part of this reef, eastward, is studded with dangerous rocks, of which some dry 7 feet at low water, but a far greater number are either just awash or have not more than from 3 to 6 feet over them at that time. The sunken part of the western * See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Channel islands and coast of France, No. 2,669 a b : scale, m = 0'5 inch. SO 11886 K 2"], [182, "154 [Chap. V.

The north-western rocky mass of the high part is called the Pipette group ; it is remarkable from having several flat-topped pillar-like rocks, and is a spot most fatal to shipping, more wrecks having taken place here than at any other part of the reef. The strength of the flood sets directly on it, and the stream is partially divided by it. Of the rocks which never cover, the most remarkable in order of magnitude are, Maitresse ile, Maisons, Haute Grune, Faucheurs, Figuier,Red Frouquie, Blanc roque, Calfateurs, Roches du Sud, Grand Vascelin, and Pipette rocks. BUOYAGE. \u2014 The light-vessel formerly moored south- westward of these dangerous reefs was finally removed in October 1891, and the approaches to the western and southern sides of the reefs are now marked and guarded by the following black buoys : \u2014 - 1. A light-buoy exhibiting a fixed white light is moored about a mile westward of the Brisants du Nord-Ouest. 2. A spindle buoy with a perch is moored about 2| miles S. by W. from the above light-buoy. 3. About 1\\ miles south-westward from the Brisants du Sud is a light-buoy standing about 26 feet above the water level ; it shows a fixed white light. An additional buoy showing also a fixed white light is moored about a cable south-westward of the principal buoy, and an automatic whistle buoy about the same distance westward of it. Thus the Brisants du Sud are marked by a group of three buoys.* 4. A spindle buoy is moored about E. by S. 2f miles from the group of buoys last described. 5. A light-buoy showing a fixed white light is moored about one mile south-westward of Le Four rock. 6. A black nun buoy is moored close to the southward of the Souarde reef. Maitresse ile, near the south-eastern side of the high middle part of the reef before referred to, is the largest islet of the group, See chart, No. 2,669 *. * An experimental automatic trumpet buoy, with a conical black buoy to mark its position were added to this group ot buoys in May, 1894."], [183, "Chap. V.] PLATEAU DES MINQUIERS. 155 although barely 200 yards long and 100 yards wide ; it is also the highest, although only 25 feet above high water. There is a little soil on this islet and some faint traces of vegetation, but it is quite destitute of fuel or subsistence of any kind, nor is there any fresh water except that deposited in the interstices of the rocks by rain. Stone was formerly quarried from the western part of the ile and used in the construction of Fort Regent, St. Helier. There are several small stone huts on the islet belonging to Jersey fishermen, who, during the summer season, which is 8 months of the year, fish over all parts of the Minquiers reef. From 16 to 18 boats are generally engaged in the lobster fishery, each boat containing 2 men ; the boats lie on the south-eastern side of the islet, where they receive partial shelter from the surrounding rocks. Vast numbers of lobsters are caught and sent to the London market ; also congers and a variety of other fish, all of which find a ready market at Jersey. The Maisons are three remarkable steep rocks with yellowish heads W.N.W. 4^ miles from Maitresse ile ; they are the highest and most conspicuous rocks at the western side of the high central portion of the reef, although not so high as Maitresse ile, being only 15 feet above high water. Haute Grune, South nearly one mile from the Maisons, rises from the centre of a large mass of rock connected with the Faucheur by a reef, of which many of the highest heads are awash at low water, springs. The Haute Grune never covers, being 5 feet above the highest tides ; it therefore serves as a good mark for other dangers in the: neighbourhood. The Grune de Norman, a reef of which the highest head uncovers 14 feet, lies W. by S. S. 5 cables from the Haute Grune. The Faucheurs is the name given to a large extent of rocks, of which three heads never cover ; they lie W. \u00a3 N. 3 miles from Maitresse ile, and S.E. by S. If miles from the Maisons ; they are remarkable from their superior size as compared with other rocks in the neighbourhood, and therefore of great service as a mark. The Figuier is a rock always above water N.W. by N. 1| miles from Maitresse ile. See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [184, "[Chap. V. 156 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. Red Frouquie is a rock of nearly the same size, height, and character as the Figuier, about midway between it and Maitresse ile. Calfateurs are four small rocks, always uncovered, a cable east ward of Maitresse ile, with which they are connected at low water. Rocher du Sud is a large rock, always uncovered, S. by W. i W. 4 cables from Maitresse ile. Grand Vascelin, NW. by N. 3 miles from Maitresse ile, uncovers 43 feet. This is a large flat rock with two heads always above water, very conspicuous from its size, and, from its position, a very useful mark. The Petit Vascelin bears N.E. by N. 1\\ cables from the Grand Vascelin and lies close to the edge of the reef near deep water, but, being 13 feet lower than the Grand Vascelin, it is covered for a considerable period during spring tides. The Pipette rocks are a group at the north-western extreme of the high part of the Minquiers reef. The highest point, like the Grand Vascelin, uncovers 43 feet, and is therefore always above water. The outer rock of the group is the Grand Haguet ; it covers at high water and bears NW. 4| cables from the high head of Pipette ; N.W.

The rocks just described are all within the limits of the middle or higher portion of the reef ; westward of this part, the most remark able are Deree Anglaise, Grune du Nord-Ouest, Brisants du Nord- Ouest, Brisants du Sud, and Deree Francaise. Southward, the danger line is marked by the Four, Souarde, and Sauvages. Eastward, numerous sunken rocks extend nearly 6 miles from Maitresse ile. Deree Anglaise is a small cluster of rocks, of which the largest and highest dries 27 feet and lies W.N.W. 2 miles from the Maisons, Maitresse ile being on the same line of bearing. There is a 3-fathoms passage between this rock and the Maisons, but it lies very close past Deree, and is only 5 cables wide ; a long string of rocks extends from the Maisons westward for 1^ miles. i See chart, No. 2,669 *."], [185, "Chap.

To pass westward of the Ardentes, between them and the Western Ardentes, bring the Enseigne beacon turret, Chausey, a little open eastward of the beacon on Grande ile. The Maisons rocks and Maitresse ile in line also lead midway between the Ardentes. The northern and western sides of the Chausey group are steep, and may be safely approached to 5 cables. The Corbiere bank however, of 3^ fathoms, lies one mile from the western shore, having a 5-fathoms channel inside it. When the Corbiere rock, Chausey, bears South, a vessel is on the line of the Western Ardentes, after passing which she may round the western end of Chausey at about L| miles. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the Minquiers at 6 h. 6 m. ; springs rise 35 feet, neaps 26 feet above the soundings. At and above half tide there are not less than 11 feet water over any part of the Caux des Minquiers. In moderate weather, light draught vessels may then safely pass over them, provided they do not venture westward of Icho and Prince's towers in line N. \\ E. When navigating in the neighbourhood of the plateau' des Minquiers, the state of the tide and the effect of the tidal stream on the vessel's course must be most carefully considered and allowed for. THE ARDENTES, 1\\ miles E.S.E. from Maitresse ile and 3\u00a3 miles northward of the Chausey group, consist of two small banks of sand, shells, and stones, each having also a few rocky heads which dry 6 feet at low water ; their western edge bears E.S.E. 7 miles from Maitresse ile.

The Western Ardentes are about 7 cables south-westward of the Ardentes, and the bank is of much the same character as the latter, but no part of it ever uncovers ; it has a general depth of from 15 to 18 feet, except over one rock near its western end on which there are but 5 feet at low water. This spot bears N. \\ W. nearly 3| miles from the Rondes de l'Ouest, the north-western rocks of the Chausey group ; and, from it, Mont St. Michel is in sight eastward of Grande lie, S.S.E. ; the remarkable trees on Mont Huchon are nearly on with Agon church E. \\ N. ; and, Prince's tower appears a little open westward of Grouville mill, which latter is somewhat difficult of recognition as it has no sweeps. Nearly midway between the Ardentes and the plateau des Minquiers is another rocky ledge of from 9 feet to 3^ fathoms. Between the Ardentes and the Chausey isles there is a good clear channel with from 7 to 9 fathoms, but great care is required in its navigation, owing to the strength of the tidal streams. Anchorage is good near the middle of the channel ; but, to prevent danger in case of driving during the strength of the stream, care must be taken to anchor clear of the line of tide of any of the dangers. THE CHAUSEY ISLES, lying between the Plateau des Min quiers and Granville, form an extensive group of little islets and rocks 6f miles long in an E.S.E. direction from the Rondes de l'Ouest to the Founet, the easternmost rock ; they are about 3 miles wide, and occupy a space of nearly 16 square miles.

The lighthouse and Semaphore stand high, and are prominent objects from seaward in all directions, showing well above all the other islets of the plateau. Grande ile has several granite quarries, of which a large quantity is sent to France. Longue ile, 6 cables eastward of the lighthouse, is very useful as a mark in rounding the south-western part of the group. On ile de la Meule, N.W. \\\\ miles from the lighthouse, are the ruins of a convent and a well of good water. The western part of the group contains 15 or 16 islets and numerous rocks. The Chausey group, although dangerous and intricate to navigate, is steep-to on the northern and western sides, but the southern side should be approached with caution, especially at low water, at which time the eastern side is quite inaccessible to vessels of deep draught, on account of the sand-banks which almost close the channel between it and Granville. The anchorage generally resorted to by vessels of war is Port Marie road, off the southern side of Grande ile. There are several harbours among the rocks completely sheltered from all winds, of which Chausey Sound, between Grande ile on the western side, and the Puceau and other rocks on the eastern side, is most used ; it is, however, very narrow, difficult of access, and only frequented by small government cruisers, fishermen, stone boats, and other small craft capable of taking the ground.

ANCHORAGES\u2014 SOUND de CHAUSEY, so called from the secure anchorage it affords to vessels of light draught, trends NW. by N. and S.E. by S. along the eastern side of the Grande ile, and occupies a space 6 cables long. At low water, springs, it is surrounded by rocks and banks of sand and mud, which form a natural harbour where vessels capable of taking the ground find capital shelter ; if remaining longer than one tide, or at springs, they should, however, moor head and stern to prevent tailing on the banks. The Sound is sheltered on all sides except from S.S.E. to E.S.E., and strong wands from that quarter throw in a heavy sea at high water. Fresh winds from N.N.E. to N.W. are also much felt, causing a heavy swell throughout the whole extent of the Sound from one hour before until two hours after high water. Depths. \u2014 Two entrances lead into Chausey sound, one from the southward, the other from the northward ; the latter dries as much as 15 feet in places, and therefore has from 20 feet at high water springs, to 11 feet at neaps. The southern entrance is the best, and is divided by the Epiettes rocks into the South and S.E. channels : the South channel has only one foot water in it at the lowest tides, but at high water, springs, has 36 feet, and 27 feet at neaps. The S.E. channel dries 6 feet, and therefore has 7 feet less water than the South channel. Although the deepest parts of the Sound do not dry, there remains but little water in them, and the soundings are very irregular. There are, however, two narrow gullies with space for three or four short vessels of from 10 to 11 feet draught to remain afloat. The largest, at the entrance of the Sound, is 325 yards long and from 55 to 65 yards wide, with depths of from 10 to 17 feet, but it is occupied by three mooring buoys for the use of the guard-vessel protecting the fisheries. The second is only 173 yards long, with from 8 to 1 5 feet, and is a little northward of the former, in front of the farm-house and chapel, and abreast of the Crabiere rock which uncovers 24 feet ; this anchorage also is usually occupied by one of the fishery cruisers secured with a mooring chain on each bow and quarter. The best place for grounding is on the lowest part of the See chart, No. 63. L 2 S;0 11886"], [198, "[Chap.

DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The South channel, between La Tour point and the Epiettes, is accessible to vessels drawing 10 feet when the Tonneau rock covers, and has 12 feet in mid-channel at two hours flood. In taking this channel, bring the Enseigne white beacon turret just in sight eastward of the eastern slope of Grand ile N. 3\u00b0 W., which leads between the Epiettes and La Tour patches. The beacon on the south-western rock of the Epiettes may then be steered for and approached to within half a cable ; then steer northward in mid channel parallel with the shore of the isle, and, if intending to run northward of the Crabiere, pass between its beacon and the beacon 100 yards eastward of it, giving the Crabiere a berth of at least 30 or 40 yards to clear the tail which runs out from it in that direction. The South-East channel is eastward of the Basse des Epiettes ; the leading mark is Gros-Mont semaphore on with the Tourette rock NW. W. The Tourette is a short steep whitewashed point on the beach a cable north-eastward of the farm-house. When passing Longue ile, to clear the ledge off its southern end, open the Semaphore a little westward of the Tourette, taking care to bring them quickly on again, after passing it ; the mark then leads directly towards the Crabiere, passing the Loup beacon, which s ands at the northern end of the rock, on the port hand, and the Ebauche beacon, on the western part of that ridge, on the starboard hand, and over a bank of mud which dries at low water, springs, northward of the Epiettes, when a vessel may either anchor or proceed as if coming through the South channel. The mud bank referred to completely bars the channel, and can only be crossed by vessels above 10 feet draught after 2h hours flood. When the highest head of the Loup covers, there are 16 feet water on this bank. The North entrance into Sound de Chausey is northward of the Enseigne, between the rocks extending 2 cables eastward of Pointue rock and the Grande Entree ; this latter is a small group of rocks, of which the highest head uncovers 38 feet, 3\u00a3 cables eastward See chart, No. 63."], [199, "Chap.

The inner portion of this channel, southward of the Etardiere, is completely barred at low water by vast sand-banks uncovering generally only a few feet, but between the Sauniere and Vieux they dry as much as 15 feet in places. Most of the rocks being marked by beacons, strict attention to the following directions render it safe of access between half flood and half ebb to vessels up to 10 feet draught; no stranger, however, should attempt such a channel without a pilot. From the entrance, the channel takes a southerly direction between the western edge of a rocky group named Longues, on the western edge of which is a beacon, and the Basse de l'Etardiere, a flat rock at 2 cables distance which uncovers 8 feet a cable eastward of the Etardiere, to which rock it is joined at low water, springs, by a sand-bank. From thence, the channel takes a W.S.W. direction between the Etardiere rock, which never covers, and the Enseigne ; and then, a southerly direction, leaving on the port hand the low rocks extending from the Petite Enseigne, the Sauniere a small islet 56 feet above the lowest tides, and the Petite Fourche ; and, on the starboard hand, the Massue and a rocky group eastward of the Vieux, and from thence to the Sound. The Massue has a beacon off its north-eastern extreme and a whitewashed rock at its south eastern ; a rock with a beacon lies off the northern end of the Petite Fourche nearly in the fairway, and a vessel may pass it on either side. In entering by the North channel, the leading mark is, Chausey lighthouse on with the Enseigne beacon turret S. E. ; keep the lighthouse, however, twice its breadth open eastward of the beacon turret whilst passing eastward of the low rocks extending from the Pointue, and twice its breadth open westward whilst passing the Longues rocks. In passing the Basse de l'Etardiere, when the two white patches on the Massue and the Chapeau rocks are in line, or when the southern end of Meule islet is just touching the northern end of the Massue S.W. \\ W., run in that direction until the light house is on with the south-western point of Sauniere islet S. by E. \\ E.; this leads up to the Sauniere ; give it a berth of half a cable in passing, and also leave the beacon off its southern end close on the port hand, and, after passing it, steer in mid-channel between the beacons marking the rocks on either side of the channel abreast of the Gros-Mont.

Enseigne anchorage is a small space where vessels of 10 feet draught, with good pilots, may find shelter afloat at low water from S.W., South, or S.E. winds. With northerly winds, no vessel should anchor there except to await water through the North channel into Chausey Sound, as from its limited extent there is neither room to veer nor drive without tailing on the sand-bank, which, at low water, dries 1^ cables northward of the Enseigne. Run for this anchorage through the North entrance with the same mark as if bound for Chausey Sound until the vessel is well south ward of the Pointue ; then bring the lighthouse on with the south western slope of the Enseigne, and when the southern end of Meule iilet touches the northern end of the Massue rock, anchor, and the vessel will be in the best berth and deepest water, 22 to 36 feet, sandy bottom, midway between the Basse de l'Etardiere, and the Longue. Between half ebb and half flood, great care must be taken to estimate the depth, as the soundings, when southward of the Pointue rocks, vary from 7 feet only to 22 feet at low water, and also to avoid a small rock with only 4 feet, nearly in the fairway of the entrance. PORT MARIE is the little bay between La Tour and Bretagne points, in front of which, 2 cables off-shore, is a small space capable of affording shelter from winds between N.W. and N.E. to two or three vessels of 10 feet draught.

Conchee anchorage.\u2014 With the wind from N.W. by W. to N.N.E. the Conchee anchorage in 4^ or 5 fathoms is to be preferred ; the marks for it are, the old castle in ruins on Grande ile on with the Huguenans beacon turret W. by N. \\ N., and the Selliere and Culas siere rocks in line N.W. by N.

The leading mark in, is, the lighthouse on with Gros-Mont semaphore S.E. by S., and when the Pointue rock appears midway between the Dechiree and Grande Entree rocks the vessel is in the middle of the anchorage. There is another anchorage with from 2-|- to 5 fathoms, called the Dechiree, eastward of that just described ; it is entirely surrounded by high rocks, which cover at the last quarter flood, forming between half ebb and half flood a natural harbour accessible at all tides, but no vessel should use it in changeable, boisterous weather, or without a good local pilot ; it is not more than 5 cables long and 2%j cables wide, the broadest part being between the Dechiree and a rock to the southward which uncovers 24 feet. To enter this anchorage, proceed as before with the lighthouse on with the Semaphore ; and, when the Pointue is half its apparent breadth open southward of the Dechiree, the vessel is southward of the Rondes de la Dechiree and should haul to the eastward, taking care to avoid two rocky patches awash at low water, springs, on the southern side of the anchorage.

It is tolerably well protected throughout the tide at neaps, but at high water, springs, fresh winds from N.W. to N.E. cause a heavy tumbling sea, which, however, soon subsides as the tide falls. Vessels usually moor N.N.E. and S.S.W., but, if intending to remain, they should be secured with anchors on each bow and quarter. Two sets of moorings with mooring buoys for the use of the small French steam-vessels employed in protecting the oyster fishery occupy the central part of the anchorage. Southern entrances.\u2014 A vessel of considerable draught with a fair wind and an experienced pilot, may enter the Beauchamp anchorage from the southward at all times by passing between the Grand Piliers and Tournioure rocks ; the latter has on it a beacon, which, however, is sometimes washed away and should not be depended on ; or, between the Tournioure and Chapelle rocks ; but these narrow passages cannot be used at all times without steam or a sufficiently commanding breeze to stem the tidal streams. The leading mark to pass between the Tournioure and Piliers is, the summit of Roche Noire on with the Culassiere rock N.N.E. Great care is required in passing the Tournioure at half flood, the stream immediately outside it setting strongly to the eastward, whilst between it and the Piliers it takes the direction of the channel. Having passed the Tournioure beacon, steer north-eastward towards the Petit Huguenan to get into the fairwayy and then more northerly to pass midway between that islet and Roche Noire, after which the summit of the rock Caniard du Sud open westward of the Culassiere N. by E. \\ E. leads to the anchorage. The entrance eastward of the Tournioure is the deepest, but is only 50 or 60 yards wide between the Tournioure and Chapelle rocks, and should never be attempted during the strength of the tide ; the best time is within an hour of high water, and the nearer high water the See chart, No. 63."], [204, "[Chap.

The entrance is between the Gaillard d'Avant rock which uncovers 29 feet and has just northward of it the Artimon rock which uncovers 19 feet, and some small heads close south-westward of the Conchee which uncover from 9 to 17 feet. The leading mark is, the Selliere and Petite Mauvaise rocks in line N.N.W. until the lighthouse comes on with the middle of the Ango rock ; then haul to the westward for the anchorage and cross the mud-bank extending northward from the Huguenans. When the small heads close south-westward of the Conchee are covered and the Artimon rock is awash, there are not less than 13 feet on any part of the mud-bank which must be crossed in running for the anchorage. Passe Orientale de FEtat. \u2014 The Beauchamp anchorage may also be reached from the north-eastward through this passage, which is a clear space through the rocks in the north-eastern part of the Chausey group ; the tide, however, must be sufficiently high for a vessel to cross the sand-bank, which extends over the greater part of the passage and dries from 2 to 5 feet above the level of the lowest tides. The entrance to this passage, H cables wide, is between the Pouillou rock which uncovers 32 feet, and some small rocky heads connected with the Petit Etat which uncover from 5 to 10 feet. From thence the passage is bounded on the western side by the Caniard du Sud which uncovers 38 feet, and by the Mauvaise, always above water ; and, on the eastern side, by the Plate du Hibou, a small rocky group of which the highest head uncovers 26^ feet, and by the Culassiere rock which is never covered.

GRANVILLE. \u2014 The port of Granville is between pointe du Roc and Gautier point, which latter bears S.E. by E. \\ E. 9 cables from the south-western extreme of Roc point. Gautier point See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [208, "[Chap. V. 180 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. is high, and on its summit is a fort which commands the entrance to Granville harbour. The town of Granville is built in the form of an amphitheatre at the foot of the eastern part of the high, narrow, steep peninsula of Le Roc, which is nearly a mile long W. \\ S. and E. \\ N., BOO yards wide, and united with the mainland by a narrow isthmus half a mile northward of Gautier point. The upper town is sur rounded by walls and occupies the eastern part of the peninsula ; the lower town stands on the isthmus at the entrance of a narrow valley enclosed between high hills, and watered by the little river Bosc which separates the suburbs from the lower town, its waters when swollen by rains running over the sands westward. The Outer harbour is on the western side of the lower town at the foot of Le Roc, which, with the adjacent land, shelters it from winds from N.W. round by North and East to S.S.E., and the pier protects it from the heavy sea caused by south-westerly winds, but it is open from South to S.S.E. The water is smooth in the harbour when it blows hard from North to N.W., but vessels should then be well moored to resist the violent squalls which rush down from Le Roc. The pier is built on the rocks which uncover at the foot of the south-western part of Le Roc. It begins at 65 yards west ward of the last houses in the lower town, and from thence extends in a southerly direction about 390 yards ; it then turns eastward for about 210 yards, and is terminated by a broad pier-head. The eastern pier approaches the western pier from the north-eastward, leaving a passage about 142 yards wide between the pier-heads. Depths. \u2014 The bottom between the pier-heads is of hard sand and gravel and dries 10 feet above the level of the lowest tides; here there are 27 feet at high water, springs, and upwards of 17 feet at neaps. Inside it dries 19 feet, but the bottom is of soft mud, and affords good berths for the crowds of fishing craft, by which it is usually occupied. This harbour can be entered by the vessels which usually frequent it at ordinary neaps from 1^ hours before to.l^ hours after high water. The Inner harbour is a wet dock or basin, having its entrance from the eastern side of the outer harbour by means of a lock 246 feet in length and 54^ feet wide ; its outer sill has 30 feet, and its inner sill 24 feet over it at high water, ordinary springs, which latter See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [209, "Chap.

Another small basin lies on the eastern side of the main basin and communicates with it by means of an opening, without gates, 39^ feet wide ; vessels of 14 feet draught are neaped in this inner basin during several tides, and it can only be entered from one to 1^ hours before or after high water, according to the height of the tide. Communications, &C. \u2014 Granville is in direct railway com munication with Paris, the distance occupying about 8 hours ; the steamers of the London and South-Western Railway Company also ply regularly between it and Jersey, thus connecting it with England. It has a considerable trade, but one of its principal industries, the oyster fishery, has entirely failed of late years. The rocky bed forming the base of the western. part of Le Roc uncovers 3| cables in a southerly direction from pointe du Roc, and 2 cables North and N.W. from the north-western part of the peninsula, which latter part is marked by a beacon surmounted by a globe, the upper part of the beacon white, the lower part black. Loup rock. \u2014 Beacon turret. \u2014 This rock, the nearest danger to the harbour, is marked by a beacon turret painted with red and white bands ; it lies S. by W. | W. 2f cables from the extreme of the western pier, and uncovers 21 feet ; it forms a natural breakwater during south-westerly gales. The west pier-head lighthouse on with the gap which separates Le Roc from the hills north-eastward of it, leads a cable westward of the Loup ; and, the same lighthouse on with Granville church steeple leads half a cable eastward. The rock covers at half flood, at which time there are 10 feet between the pier-heads, and 16^ feet over the Tombelaine bank. LIGHTS. \u2014 Granville lighthouse, a circular tower 43 feet high, stands on pointe du Roc or cape Lihou, and exhibits, at 154 feet above high water, a flashing white light of the third order, visible 15 miles. It shows groups of four flashes reproduced every fifteen seconds. From it, Chausey lighthouse bears N.W. by W. J W. 8^ miles ; Pierre de Herpin light W.S.W. 10 miles ; and Senequet rock light N. | E. 15\u00a3 miles.

The pilot flag over a flag with two white and two red quarters indicates that the outer gates are open and the inner gates closed. 4. A red flag only indicates that the water in the inner harbour is falling. Pilots. \u2014 Granville pilots cruise in the vicinity of the iles Chausey in decked two-masted boats. Vessels approaching Granville from the westward, however, during strong westerly winds, do well to haul up under the lee of Grouin point to secure a pilot, as at such times boats may not be able to keep the sea off Granville. Pilots take charge of vessels leaving Granville as far westward as cape Frehel, or as far northward in the Cotentin channel as the Banes Feles. A Life-Boat is stationed at Granville. DIRECTIONS.* \u2014 Entering Granville. \u2014 Bring the West pier-head lighthouse open of the fall of the land under the eastern end of Garrison bluff, to pass between the tail of the Loup and the rocks on which the pier is built ; or, if wishing to pass eastward of the Loup rock, open Granville church its own breadth eastward of See chart, No. 2,669 b. * Directions for navigating the Cotentin passage between cape de la Hague and Granville will be found at pages 214-220."], [211, "Chap. V.] GRANVILLE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 183 the lighthouse. Give the pier-head, when rounding it, a berth of a ship's length only, shoot as far to the westward as possible when within it, and drop the anchor when convenient. A vessel drawing 10 feet must not attempt to round the pier-head until 4 hours flood, especially if there be any sea. All possible sail should be carried when entering the harbour, and, in the event of a sudden shift of wind, a vessel should be prepared either to anchor or to run out a hawser to the v>arping buoy between the Loup rock and the plateau Jean-la-Blanche. When it blows hard between N.W. and S.W., the great inequalities of the rocky ridge extending southward from Granville lighthouse occasion a heavy sea outside the mouth of the harbour, and the outer part of this ridge, which uncovers 9 feet at the lowest tides, is then very dangerous ; there is also a heavy breaking sea in the passage between the pier and the Loup with strong winds between N.W. and West. This dangerous part is avoided by keeping St. Nicholas church steeple on with the southern slope of Gautier point. Should the wind be light, endeavour to maintain a position off the harbour, so as to be carried towards the entrance from 1-Js hours before to half an hour after high water, while the stream is running East and E.N.E. ; but do not attempt to enter before high water, or the vessel may be carried westward of the pier, and even on pointe du Roc, by the eddy on the flood, which leaves the harbour after traversing the quays from East to West, and runs along the shore towards pointe du Roc. The strength of this eddy is from one to H knots at springs, it runs from half flood to high water, and it is in order to stem it that plenty of sail should be carried when entering the harbour. When arriving off the harbour before there is sufficient water to enter ; if the wind is strong enough to stem the tide, keep southward of the line of St. Nicholas church steeple on with the southern slope of Gautier point. With the wind from N.E. round by North to W.N.W. keep northward of this line and make short tacks southward of the Chausey islets, between Chausey lighthouse and the Conchee ; and, with the wind from W.N.W. round by West to South, short boards should be made between Grouin point and the Basse Pari sienne, not standing southward of an imaginary line drawn from Pierre de Herpin lighthouse to Champeaux point. As soon as there is water sufficient to enter the harbour, steer for it, keeping the West See chart. No. 2.669 u. M SO 11886"], [212, "[Chap. V 184 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. pier-head lighthouse on with the gap which separates Le Roc peninsula from the hills north-eastward of the town ; this lead3 a cable westward of the Loup and to the entrance of the harbour. In working towards the harbour from the S.W., make a long board to the northward of the line of St. Nicholas church steeple on with the southern slope of Gautier point, but avoid being carried too far northward by the flood stream. The last board should be made south-eastward of the Loup, taking care to avoid the Norocher, a ridge of rocks of which parts uncover from 10 to 12 feet. From thence, stand for the harbour eastward of the Loup, on which side that rock may be approached to within half a cable without danger. At low water, neaps, small coasters arriving off the harbour with the wind off-shore may anchor to await tide between the Loup rock and Tombelaine bank, where they will then find 10 or 12 feet water over a bottom of sand and broken shells ; at low water, springs, there are only 2 or 3 feet water here. There are also a few rocks in the eastern part of the anchorage, but with Mont St. Michel open of Champeaux point, a vessel is 2 cables westward of them. Leaving Granville, a sailing vessel of deep draught should wait for a leading wind, and, if bound westward, advantage should be taken of off-shore winds, particularly those between East and South. If the wind is between E.S.E. and S.S.E. and strong enough to stem the tide, leave as soon as the vessel floats and steer to pass 2 or 3 miles northward of Cezembre island and of cape Frehel. If between South and W.S.W., haul out to the warping buoys as soon as she is afloat and make sail from the outer buoy. Short boards must be made as far as Thar point, 2--V miles southward of the harbour, and from thence they may be lengthened, coasting at a safe distance from the in-shore dangers as far as cape Frehel, to avoid being carried by the tides towards the Minquiers and other off-lying dangers. In fine weather, the Minquiers light-buoys, together with the lights of Chausey, Granville, Pierre de Herpin, St. Malo, and cape Frehel, render this navigation as easy by night as by day. THE COAST. \u2014 From pointe du Roc, Granville, cape de Carteret, which is the western extreme of the first high land on the coast northward of Granville, bears N. j- E. 33 miles, the ->vhole of the coast line between the two points being low and receding slightly eastward.

For the first 16 miles northward of Granville, the sandy beach bordering the coast dries in places at low water as much as 2^ miles from the shore ; northward of Geffosse it uncovers on an average about one mile, and, throughout the whole extent of this tidal sea board, numerous reefs of rocks are scattered in all directions, rendering the approach to it exceedingly dangerous. The off-lying reefs and shoals between the coast and the Channel islands are also very numerous, causing the navigation between Granville and Cape de la Hague by this route, known as the Cotentin channel, to be both intricate and dangerous, the latter especially if surprised by foggy weather, though it is well lighted and buoyed. Coutances cathedral, about 6 miles inland and 14 miles N.E. from pointe du Roc, may be known by its two spires or turrets ; it is lofty and a useful land-mark. The church steeple of Agon, one mile inland, is a large square tower covered with tiles, and the little church steeple of Pirou 8 miles further northward very much resembles it. From Coutances towards Granville, the interior of the country presents a moderately high but regular outline which ter minates at Champeaux point, the bluff and nearly perpendicular headland 5f miles southward of Granville. From Coutances north ward the character of the country alters, the interior being high though somewhat irregular, and between St. Germain and Barneville, 2 miles eastward of cape de Carteret, the inequalities become very marked and conspicuous. The entrance to Regneville is 10 miles N.N.E. \\ E. from Granville lighthouse. The coast between it and St. Germain trends N. by E. for 13 miles, and the shore is low, sandy, and bordered with downs. Among the most remarkable objects is Mont Huchon, about 2 miles northward of Coutances cathedral and 6 miles inland eastward of the entrance to Regneville harbour, and of the western part of the line of hills immediately northward of the harbour, on which stand the village and church of Agon. This part of the hills ends abruptly with steep slopes towards the sea, and, when seen from the north westward at a distance, presents the appearance of a high cape facing westward.

CATHEUE BANKS, including Catheue reef and Shamrock knoll, extend North and South 6 miles and lie nearly parallel with the line of coast ; they are chiefly composed of sand. Two patches near their middle dry at very low tides, at which time there are 6 feet at their southern end and 2 fathoms at their northern end. These banks are almost connected with the shore on their eastern side and, southward, with the shoal extending from pointe du Roc, from which point, their northern extreme is distant 11 miles ; they are only separated from the Ronquet reef off Regneville by a bed of sand which has from 2 to 12 feet over it at low water, at which time there is no /navigable passage between the banks and the shore.

Roches d'Agon are a small group 3\u00a3 miles from the shore, half way between it and the northern extreme of the Shamrock knoll, and 1^ miles north-westward from the Ronquet beacon turret, with from 8 to 10 feet water close to them. They form, in conjunction with a bed of rocks on the beach, a continuous ridge extending west ward from the direction of Agon steeple, and parallel with the Ronquet and Moulieres d'Agon rocks.

Champeaux point just open westward of pointe du Roc leads well westward of it. REGNEVILLE is at the mouth of the little river Sienne, into which the river Soulles flows 4 miles in the interior ; the harbour is so choked with sand as to be practically dry at high water, neaps, and to admit coasters only of about 8 or 9 feet draght at high water, springs. The bottom being chiefly sand and shells, is bad holding ground ; the anchors should therefore be buried to avoid driving with strong winds between W.N.W. and S.W., to which the entrance is exposed. The entrance is between the Bee d'Agon, or Agon point, and the point on which the guard-house stands, which, on with Mont Martin windmill, is the mark for the south-western extreme of the Ronquet group ; several sand-banks lie in the fairway, and the action of the tides causes Agon point to grow constantly southward, the lighthouse originally built near the extreme being now more than 3 cables from it. Two channels, marked by beacons and buoys, lead to the entrance, but both are very subject to change and neither should be attempted without a local pilot. The deepest channel borders the southern side of the Ronquet group and the Moulieres d'Agon ; the leading mark for it is, the fort 3 cables north-westward of the extreme of Agon point seen between the steeples of Coutances and Grimouville about E. by N.

A red bell-buoy, with staff and reflector, is moored in 6 feet water off their western side. The Nattes rocks lie W. \u00a3 N. 3^ miles from the entrance of Blainville harbour ; S.W. 2\u00a3 miles from Senequet lighthouse ; and, the marks for the highest head, which uncovers 3 feet only, are, Senequet lighthouse a little open westward of Pirou church steeple ; and, Coutances steeples on with the houses of Courtainville, a village built on a remarkable mound, E.S.E.

It is 2 miles from the shore, 2^ miles N.W. from the entrance to Blainville, and uncovers 27^ feet. It is the highest head of the rocky ridge which extends eastward from it to the shore, south-eastward to the Klebet rocks, south-westward as far as the Nattes rocks, and north-westward 8 cables, where a floating beacon is moored. This outer part is very dangerous, as it greatly contracts the passage between the Senequet rock and the B\u0153uf. The outer head is awash at the lowest tides, with Senequet lighthouse just open southward of Blainville church steeple S.E. The space for more than 2 miles between this head and the Nattes is equally dangerous, being one continued chain of rocks, of which the highest uncover from 6 to 8 feet ; when it blows hard from any direction between North and South round by West, there is a heavy sea on them. Mont Gardon church steeple between the summit of Mont Doville and St. Germain church steeple leads a safe distance outside both the Nattes and the outer rocks of the Senequet.

BASSE le MARIE, a rocky ledge nearly 4 cables long, East and West, and 2 cables wide, lies nearly midway between the northern extreme of the Catheue banks and the south-easternmost patch of the Southern Anquettes about 3 miles distant from both. Its highest head, at the eastern end of the ledge, uncovers 4^ feet at the lowest tides ; near the middle another head is awash, and at the western extreme another has 15 feet over it at the same time. The ledge has from 4 to 7 fathoms round it, with sandy bottom mixed with pieces of shell.

The B\u0153uf rock. \u2014 Beacon turret.\u2014 This, the highest rock of the group, is about one third from the eastern end of the Chaussee, and is marked by a beacon turret painted with red and white bands, 10 feet above high water, and surmounted by a short mast and globe. The marks for this rock, which uncovers 18 feet at the lowest tides, are, Seymour tower, Jersey, touching the southern side of the Grande Anquette rock N.W. by W. ; and Hatainville sand-hills seen between capes de Carteret and Flamanville.

DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Vessels navigating in the northern vicinity of the Chaussee-des-B\u0153ufs between half ebb and half flood, the most dangerous time, must be careful to keep Bergerie house open north ward of Seymour tower, and Bouley signal-station a quarter of a point open northward of Rozel mill, a building without sweeps, with a white dome roof, and the main part of a dull reddish colour. The signal-station will be also just open of Rozel manor-house. Southward of the Anquettes and the B\u0153ufs, for a long distance, the sea is much encumbered by sunken rocks and banks of sand and gravel having from 4 to 6 fathoms over them ; indeed, from the southern Anquettes in the direction of Basse le Marie and the iles Chausey, scarcely a spot is quite free from one or the other, and in boisterous weather the whole of that space is one con tinuous sheet of broken water. The proper channels, lying eastward and westward of this accumulation of shoal ground, are pretty clear. The Chaussee-des-B\u0153ufs and Anquettes being so beset on all sides by danger, the utmost caution is necessary, especially in large vessels, to navigate with any degree of safety between or near them ; the best time is between half flood and high water, but there exists only one continuous leading mark for the passage between them, viz., the church of St. Pierre-les-Moutiers, which has a very low See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [222, "194 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE.

The mark is useful, however, when coming from the northward, but too distant to be of much service when entering this passage from the southward, unless the weather is unusually clear. From the northward, the leading mark given must be carefully preserved until the white Semaphore house at La Moye, Jersey, opens southward of Le Fret point N.W. \\ W. ; or, until Coutances cathedral appears midway between Blainville and Agon churches E.S.E. ; and, it must always be remembered that both tidal streams set obliquely across the vessel's course. St. GERMAIN BAY.\u2014 Anchorage.\u2014 This bay is formed by the land receding eastward between Senequet rock and cape de Carteret ; it affords shelter in its northern part from winds between N.N.E. and S.E. in 5 fathoms, good holding-ground of sandy clay ; but, southward of the Banes Feles, vessels should nowhere approach the land nearer than 3^ miles, to avoid several patches of from 4 to 8 feet water only. The best anchorage is with cape de Carteret lighthouse about N. \\ E., and Pirou telegraph tower from S.E. to S.E. by E., but nothing southward of this latter bearing for fear of fouling the telegraph cable. Telegraph cable. \u2014 The telegraph cable from Fliquet bay, Jersey, see page 281, runs direct to Pirou on the French coast, where the position of its shore end is marked by a tower and its direction at sea indicated by the tower being on with Pirou church steeple S.E. by E. \\ E. The telegraph tower is easily recognised, as it stands quite alone near the beacon southward of St. Germain harbour ; it is white, 17 feet in diameter, 28 feet high, and surmounted by a green disc, on which is painted in large letters the word Telegraphe. Vessels should \"avoid anchoring or dredging anywhere near the line of the cable. Tides.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Germain at 6 h. 20 m. ; springs rise 34 feet, neaps 25 feet.

They are the western part of a long ridge, 6 cables wide, which extends south-westward from the shore ; the highest head uncovers 5 feet, and the westernmost head 4^ feet. The marks for the western head are, Mont Survent church steeple, on the high land 4 miles in the interior, just open northward of Geffosse church steeple S.E. | E. ; and Bretteville church steeple open westward of the hill which rises a little westward of the old semaphore on the western point of entrance to St. Germain N. by E. \\ E. A sand-bank, one mile long North and South and 5 cables wide, with from 4 to 8 feet water, lies 7 cables westward of these rocks and 2 miles from the shore ; it is dangerous to vessels working up in-shore, and may be avoided by keeping Mont Gardon church steeple open northward of the guard-house of the battery on the western point of entrance to St. Germain. There are also two small sand-banks with 7 and 8 feet water over them between the Sac-de- Pirou and the Senequet rock ; in fact, at 2\\ miles from the shore, between the Senequet and St. Germain, the depth does not average more than 15 feet. Senequet lighthouse on with Ronquet beacon turret S. \\ W. leads well outside this depth. GEFFOSSE, E.N.E. 3| miles from Senequet lighthouse and \\r\\ miles southward of St. Germain, is a very small harbour, only capable of affording shelter at high water, springs, to fishing-boats of about 10 tons burthen ; it is quite open to W.N.W. and when it blows hard from that quarter there is a nasty tumbling sea at the entrance. St. GERM AIN-SUR-AY.\u2014 This little harbour lying N.E. by N. 1\\ miles from Senequet rock lighthouse and S. by E. \\ E. 12 miles from cape de Carteret, admits vessels drawing 7 or 8 feet at high water, springs, but a vessel of that draught will be neaped within it for 5 or 6 days. The sand-banks, both inside the harbour and at the entrance, are so liable to shift that it is not prudent to enter without a pilot. It is well sheltered on all sides except from S.W. to South, and strong winds from that direction send in a heavy sea. The strand uncovers H miles outside the entrance, and the Cabot with several other rocks rise from it exactly in the fairway.

The Cabot rock is at the south-eastern extreme of a ridge ex tending 1^ miles westward from the western point of entrance to St. Germain. It is the highest and nearest rock to the entrance, un covers 25 feet, and bears S. f E. 8 cables from the guard-house on the western point of entrance, with the guard-house just open eastward of the old semaphore. The southern part of this ridge does not cover during neaps, and they are the highest rocks between St. Germain and cape de Carteret. A sand-bank, with only 7 feet water and from 18 to 22 feet around, lies If miles outside the ridge and W. N. 2| miles from the old semaphore. This little bank is extremely dangerous to coasters working up along shore, and, as no marks for it can be given, they should keep from 2^ to 3 miles from the land. SURVILLE, 5 miles northward of St. Germain and S.S.E. 7\u00a3 miles from cape de Carteret, is a small harbour with a sandy bottom, and does not admit vessels drawing more than 7 feet at high water, springs. The bottom outside for 3 miles south-westward of it is very uneven, several little ridges with from 8 to 18 feet rising from it. A small rocky ridge with only 4 feet over the highest head and from 12 to 19 feet close to, lies W.S.W. 1| miles from the entrance ; no marks can be given for this dangerous reef. BASSES de TAILLEPIED\u2014 The Basses de Taillepied and Banes Feles lie nearly midway between the Ecrehos rocks, fully described at page 285, and the shore, and the centre of the shoals is about 4| miles S.S.W. from cape de Carteret ; they form one bank and occupy a space .4 miles leng N.W. i W. and S.E.

The channel between the Taillepied and the Ecrehos rocks is H miles wide, with a patch of 11 feet in its southern entrance, but no leading mark for it can be given. From the great rapidity of the streams, there is generally a turbulent sea in this passage even in the finest weather, and in rough weather it is exceedingly dangerous for small vessels to attempt it. PORT BAIL.\u2014 The entrance to this harbour is 8 miles north ward of St. Germain and S.S.E. \u00a7 E. 4^ miles from cape de Carteret lighthouse ; it is the best harbour between cape de la Hague and Granville, and has the advantage of being in direct railway communication with the general system of the country, but its trade is quite insignificant. Depths. \u2014 There are 13 or 14 feet water in the entrance at high water, springs, and the harbour is accessible for one hour before or after high water ; at high water, neaps, boats of 6 feet draught cannot always enter. The bottom is sand, which dries from half ebb to half flood. The little river Grise discharges itself into the harbour. The entrance is not more than a cable wide and is open to the S.W. ; it is between the southern point of the harbour and Caillourie, a sandy islet on which stands the Custom-house and the outer leading light, on point Dune, its south-eastern end. The islet is from 25 to 30 feet above the level of the bottom of the harbour, and is b\\ cables south-westward of the village of port Bail. South-eastward of it is a bed of pebbles and small stones about a cable in extent, which should be avoided ; and, southward of it, a rock which does not cover. Buoys. \u2014 A black buoy marks the entrance of the channel, and, between it and the entrance points are some mooring buoys where vessels may moor head and stern in the direction of the channel ; the position, however, is very exposed, and no vessel should make use of these buoys except in fine settled weather. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed harbour leading lights are established at port Bail, the inner red light being shown from the church tower, and the outer white light from a staff erected by a little white hut at point Dune, distant from the inner light S.W. by W.

The berth where the tide rises highest is on the bed of the fresh water stream E.N.E. and East of the southern point of entrance, but it is an uneasy position when it blows hard from N.N.W. ; here the tide rises from 16| to 19| feet at springs, but, in running in, the lead must be kept going to avoid the bank of the stream. The best berth, but with 3\u00a3 feet less water, is about 2 cables south-westward of the guard-house near the shore 3 cables S.S.E of the church steeple ; here a vessel is sheltered on all sides except from W.N.W. Coasters, trading between here and Jersey, take up a position in the bed of the stream in front of the village. The Jument and Grand Rocher are two rocks south-westward of the entrance to Port Bail. The first is at low-water mark, \\\\ miles from the southern point of entrance, and uncovers 11\\ feet ; the other is 1\\ miles from the same point, about 7 cables southward of the Jument, and uncovers 14f feet. Basses de Port Bail are three small rocky ledges and a sand-bank fronting the entrance of Port Bail ; they are about 1^ miles in length North and South with from 6 to 9 feet water on the shoalest parts, and from one mile to 1^ miles off-shore.

CAPE de CARTERET is the western extreme of the steep hill which bounds the entrance of Havre de Carteret on its western side. This hill is the first high land on the coast northward of Granville, and is separated from the high land of the interior by a valley nearly 600 yards wide, almost entirely filled by drift sand from the neigh bouring sand-hills.

W. 4 miles from Port Bail, dries above the half tide level, but admits vessels of 10 or 11 feet draught, at springs, for half an hour before and after high water ; and of 6 feet less draught at neaps. The entrance, about 100 yards wide, is between two stone piers, of which the western is always above water, and from its head a tide light is shown, whilst the eastern jetty, being lower, covers at high water, springs, and is marked by a beacon at its outer end. The western pier, commencing at the foot of the steep eastern part of the cape, is about 640 yards long ; the eastern pier does not project quite so far seaward. The harbour is open to the southward, and during the time it is accessible the stream runs strongly across the entrance to the north westward, but between the piers it takes their direction, the ebb stream, especially, running with great velocity. This little port is quite useless for purposes of shelter and the trade is insignificant ; supplies of any description can only be obtained with difficulty and in small quantities.

A small red buoy marks a bank nearly iu mid-channel at the entrance ; there is, however, more water over the bank than over the berths in the harbour, but it is best to pass westward of the buoy where there are 3 feet more water than on the bank. THE COAST.\u2014 Northward of cape de Carteret, the coast is re markable from the sand-hills of Hatainville, which are visible from a great distance on account of their whiteness, forming a great contrast to the dark land of capes de Carteret and Flamanville, and rendering them most useful to the mariner as a land-mark. Four miles north ward of them is Rosel point, bluff and rocky, with dangerous reefs extending more than a mile from it ; 3^ miles northward of Rosel point is cape Flamanville, also high and bluff ; the Anse de Sciotot, with a low sandy shore in its southern part but high and rocky as cape Flamanville is approached, lying between them. Northward of cape Flamanville is port Dielette, and the extensive Anse de Vauville affording good shelter in easterly winds ; the southern shore of this bay is low and sandy, rising to high land in the interior ; the northern part is high and rugged, terminating in the precipitous Nez de Jobourg, 320 feet above the level of the sea and 9| miles northward of cape Flamanville. From this point, the land falls towards cape de la Hague, which is distant 3 miles and is low, sandy, and surrounded by off-lying dangerous rocks, on the highest of which, the Gros du Raz, stands the lighthouse described at page 210. There are no hidden dangers in the offing between cape de Carteret and cape Flamanville except the Plateau des TroisGrunes ; but, from the broad sandy beach between those capes, shallows, which must be avoided at low tide, extend off-shore from \\\\ to 2\\ miles. The most prominent parts of these shallows are, the Roches-du-Rit, the Basse Bihard, the Caillou, and the Bane de Surtainville ; the first dries, the others break at the lowest tides.

Northward of Cape Flamanville, the offing remains clear of danger until the Nez de Jobourg is approached, south- westward from which point, distant from one to 2\\ miles and with a clear passage in-shore of them, are the Basses St. Gilles, Huquet de Jobourg, Huquets de Vauville, and other dangerous reefs, on which some heads uncover as much as 15 feet and all of which may be avoided by keeping Rosel point well open of cape Flamanville. -r PLATEAU des TROIS-GRUNES. \u2014 The northern edge of this dangerous reef bears W. by N. \\ N. 3f miles from cape de Carteret lighthouse ; it is about a mile long N.W. and S.E., from 2i to 8 cables wide, and has from 6 to 9 fathoms around it. It consists of a dozen rocky heads, of which two uncover from 3 to 5 feet at the south-eastern extreme of the ledge and are half a cable apart. From the highest head, cape de Carteret lighthouse bears E. \\ S. 3^ miles ; the southern extreme of the Roches-du-Rit E. \\ N. 3 miles ; the summit of cape de Carteret is between the light house and the little battery at the foot of the cape ; and, Rozel mill, Jersey, is just open south-eastward of Grande Rousse rock, Ecrehos group, S.W. | W. There are 4 or 5 rocky heads on the north-western part, of which the highest has 5 feet water ; from it, the northernmost of two remark able mills at Vislet, or Brenier, is a little open southward of the southern fort on cape de Carteret ; and, the western part of Mont Orgueil castle is on with the eastern side of Petite Rousse rock, Ecrehos. r .

A bank of sand and broken shells lies 3^ miles north-westward of the Trois-Grunes, and 4| miles N.E. by N. from the Drouilles shoals; it has 9 fathoms on it and from 11 to 14 fathoms around, is about 4 cables long N.E. and S.W. and a cable wide, and is not of itself dangerous, but causes a strong overfall which small vessels should avoid when it is blowing fresh. Roches-du-Rit. \u2014 Between cape de Carteret and Rosel point, the sands uncover from 2 to 8 cables from the shore, and several rocky ledges rise from them, of which the most dangerous are the Roches du-Rit; Their southern end is about 8 cables N.W. by N. from cape de Catteret lighthouse; from thence, the outer part of the ledge extends N. by W.

These little ridges lie athwart the streams and occasion a heavy sea when it is blowing fresh. Basse Bihard, the outermost of these dangers, is a small rocky flat north-westward of the Bane de Surtainville, with a narrow 8-fathoms channel between them, 2\\ miles from the shore ; it is 1|- cables long N.W. and S.E., and 150 yards wide, with only 6 feet water over its highest head ; from which, cape de Carteret lighthouse bears S. by E. \u00a7 E. easterly 5J miles ; Rosel point is distant 2\\ miles ; and, Pieux church open northward of Rosel point and on with a remarkable red-tiled house near the beach, bears N.E. easterly.

The shore is low and sandy from the head of the bay to Rosel point, but high and rocky towards cape Flamanville. Cape Flamanville.\u2014 Semaphore.\u2014 Cape Flamanville is a high bluff point with a guard-house and Semaphore on its summit, see page 12 ; from it the Nez de Jobourg bears N. | E. about 9 miles. It should not be approached nearer than 8 cables, nor within a depth of 10 fathoms, as it is skirted by dangers extending 5 cables from the shore ; they, however, may be avoided by day or night by keeping cape de la Hague lighthouse in sight westward of the Nez.* High granite cliffs form the shore from cape Flamanville as far as Dielette, beyond which the low sandy shore of the Anse de Vauville commences. DIELETTE, in the southern part of the Anse de Vauville and 2 miles north-eastward of cape Flamanville, has an inner and outer harbour sheltered from N.E. round by East and South to S.W. by the high land, and from S.W. round by West to North by the new granite outer pier constructed about 360 yards north-westward of the old inner pier, and forming the outer harbour, which is exposed to so much swell and surf that it is very little used ; but the outer pier breaks the sea and greatly increases the security of the inner harbour, which, however, affords anything but good grounding places, the bottom being of hard sand and gravel.

The inner harbour shoals steadily from the entrance to the head ; in the entrance it dries 16 feet, has 11 feet water at high water, springs, and only 4| feet at neaps. The outer pier extends from the shore in a northerly direction 252 yards to the Rognouse rocks, which thereform its foundation, and then curves eastward 155 yards to the eastern part of those rocks. The channel between the end of this pier, on which stands * Sec Admiralty chart. Cape Flamanville to St. Marcouf islands, No. 1,106 ; scale in = ro inch."], [234, "[Chap. V. GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. 206 a lighthouse, and the shore rocks northward of it, marked by a beacon near their edge, is about 164 yards wide. The Beacon on the northern side of the channel stands on a rock which uncovers 17 feet E. by N. N. 197 yards from the outer pier-head, and N. by W. 344 yards from the inner-pier head. This rock is on the southern edge of the rocky bed joining the shore north-eastward of the harbour, and which, in rough weather, greatly breaks the force of the sea. The channel lies N.W. by N. ,md S.E. by S., and is narrowed by low rocky ledges, which uncover at low water a cable outside both the beacon and the outer pier head. In rough weather, these ledges cause a heavy sea, to be avoided by keeping in the direction of the channel, which, near the entrance of the old harbour, is suddenly narrowed by the Pierre de la Riviere, a rock lying E. by N. N. 95 yards from the inner pier-head, and very dangerous to vessels working in. The Inner harbour admits vessels of about 10 feet draught, at springs ; but, the entrance is so surrounded by rocks that access to it is hazardous except at high water and with a leading wind. The pier forming the Inner harbour is about 186 yards in length. The entrance is 72 yards wide and open to N.N.E. ; it is between the inner pier-head and the extreme of a little pile of loose stones on the steep eastern shore of the harbour. From thence, the bottom, of hard sand and gravel, takes a gentle ascent to the level of high water, neaps. The best position for grounding is about two thirds the length of the pier from the pier head, but, as the bottom is hard, precautions must be taken to prevent the vessel falling over. Although extensive works have been accomplished in the con struction of this harbour, a few fishing-boats only belong to the port and its trade is very insignificant, being represented by about 60 small coasters, averaging 40 tons, calling annually. A Life-Boat is stationed at port Dielette. Harbour lights.\u2014 Two fixed harbour lights are exhibited at port Dielette, and when in line S.E. by S. they lead through the channel to the inner harbour. The Outer light is shown from an iron gibbet fixed to a white iron shed, at 31 feet above high water, at the outer pier-head. The See chart, No. 1.106."], [235, "Chap.

The Inner light is fixed red and 75 feet above high water ; it stands on the shore and is shown from a mast on a wooden hut ; it is 510 yards S.E. by S. from the outer light, and is visible 13 miles through an arc of 32\u00b0, i.e., 16\u00b0 on each side of the leading line. A small green light is shown on the inner pier-head. Directions. \u2014 When nearing the port, keep a good look out for the beacon on the eastern rocks, and steer to pass between it and the lighthouse on the outer pier-head, passing about half a cable from the lighthouse, and then direct for the inner pier-head, which round as closely as possible in order to avoid the Pierre de la Riviere. With moderate winds from West round by North to N.E., these directions can be followed from half an hour before to half an hour after high water by vessels drawing not more than 10 feet ; but* when the wind is fresh from that quarter, they can only enter at the top of high water, springs. With the wind between West and South, a position should be gained south-westward of the harbour before bearing up for the lighthouse. With a head wind, the channel should not be attempted without a pilot. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port Dielette at 6h. 40m. ; springs rise 27 feet, neaps 20| feet, above the zero of soundings. ANSE de VAUVILLE, between cape Flamanville and the Nez de Jobourg, affords good shelter against all winds from South round by East to N.E. in from 4 to 12 fathoms, fine ! hard sand. This bay is much resorted to by merchant vessels. and coasters overtaken by light winds, unable to save their tide through the Race of Alderney, or waiting for sufficient water to cross the. flats southward of cape de Carteret ; they should, however, be prepared to weigh and gain an offing if the wind veers to the, westward.

NEZ DE JOBOURG.\u2014 Semaphore.\u2014 From near Vauville, the coast rises and for about 4 miles consists of rugged cliffs 300 feet high, intersected by deep and narrow valleys, terminating westward in this high bluff promontory, 420 feet above the sea level, which may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 24 miles. There is a Semaphore station, see page 12, on its summit, a small hummock, of which the slopes extend to the edge of the nearly perpendicular cliffs on its western side. About 1J miles inland, eastward of the Nez, stands Jobourg church, a conspicuous and useful sea-mark. Northward of the Nez, 3 miles distant, is cape de la Hague, low and sandy ; and, south-eastward of it, the high rugged coast for 2| miles is bordered by rocks as far as 3 cables from the shore ; of these the most dangerous are, the Huitriere, Sidman, Foraine, Brequets, and Ronde. The three first uncover from 10 to 11 feet at the lowest tides, and the Ronde 15 feet ; the Brequets never cover. The Dossiere rock. \u2014 The Nez de Jobourg is surrounded by a rocky barrier extending one mile north-westward and terminating in the Basses de la Dossiere, two rocky flats having only 9 feet water on them. The Dossiere rock, 4 cables northward of the Nez, uncovers 16 feet and is the highest rock of the barrier. It gives a useful indication to local pilots of the state of the tidal stream in the offing, as it covers at about half flood tide by the shore, at which time the flood or northern stream begins to be felt round the Nez and in the Race of Alderney. The Greniquet rock on with the low point of cape de la Hague leads close westward of the foul ground surrounding the Nez. South-westward and southward of the Nez de Jobourg and occupying a space of nearly 2\\ miles W.N.W. and E.S.E. are several dangerous shoals, with a passage between them and the coast, of which the principal are the Huquets de Jobourg, the Basses St. Gilles, the Huquets de Vauville, and the Calenfriers.

Huquets de Vauville are 3^ cables eastward of the Huquets de Jobourg and form the eastern extreme of the range ; they are of small extent, and the highest head which uncovers 15 feet, is con sidered a half-tide rock by the pilots, who, when awaiting in Vauville bay the most favourable moment to cross Alderney race, weigh when its summit is about 2 feet above water, and gain an offing in order to pass westward of the St. Gilles.

The harbour affords a useful shelter for small coasters, and the supplies for the lighthouse are embarked from it, but it has no trade of the least importance. The entrance, bearing E. \\ N. 3 cables from the Diotret rock, is between two large rocks joining the shore ; that on the southern side, named Jet) d'Amont, is awash at high water, neaps ; and, that on the northern side, Jet d'Aval, is about 2 feet above that level. Depths. \u2014 The harbour dries 11 or 12 feet above the lowest tides, has from 10 to 15 feet water at high water, springs, and from 6 to 7 feet at neaps, but it is inaccessible during strong N.W. or S.W. winds on account of the heavy sea ; in any case, since it can only be entered at high water, that is to say, when the stream is at its greatest speed in the Race of Alderney, the approach to it must always be difficult and often dangerous, and no vessel should attempt it without a pilot. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Goury harbour, at 7h. 6m. ; springs rise 22 feet, neaps \\1\\ feet. A Life-Boat is stationed at Goury.

COTENTIN PASSAGE.\u2014 Depths.\u2014 This passage is along the western coast of the peninsula of Cotentin and over the sandy flat which extends from the shore nearly the whole of the distance between cape de Carteret and Granville. The least depth will be found at the two entrances : \u2014 Off cape de Carteret, over the tail of the Banes Feles, the least low water depth nearing on the leading line is 8 feet. At the southern entrance between pointe du Roc and the Admiralty bank it is from 6 to 10 feet. At the spot indicated in *he northern entrance there are 6\u00a3 fathoms at high water, springs, and 5 fathoms at neaps. In the southern entrance, owing to the greater range of tide, there are at least 7 fathoms at high water springs, and 5jj fathoms at neaps. Elsewhere, the water in the channel is con siderably deeper but full of dangerous shoals on either side. Coasters use this channel at all times of tide, but sailing vessels of deep draught bound to Granville generally take the Deroute channel, passing westward of Jersey and the Minquiers. Winds between South and East are the most favourable for entering the passage from the southward, and between North and East from the northward. In fine weather, a vessel bound northward may run through it with the wind from South to S.W. j and, if bound southward, with the wind from North to N.W. ; but, it is imprudent to enter it from either direction with the wind blowing strongly between S.W. and N.W., or in thick weather. Tidal Streams, &C. \u2014 The streams in the Cotentin passage run nearly parallel with the shore, their strength, at springs, being from 4 to 5 knots, and from 2\\ to 3 knots at neaps. In running through this passage from the northward, it must be borne in mind that the south-western stream begins to be felt in the Race of Alderney about an hour before high water at Dover, i.e., at half ebb by the shore at cape de la Hague, or about 4 hours after high water at Granville or St. Malo ; and, that even if the Race is passed through during the last of the north-eastern stream, it is quite impossible to reach Granville before low water in the passage. Anchorage. \u2014 Several anchorages with fair shelter against easterly winds exist along this coast, but the leading marks should be care fully attended to ; and, in case of thick weather when these cannot be discerned, vessels should anchor in such a depth as to allow for See charts, Nos. 2,669 a and b."], [243, "Chap.

If waiting for water to cross the Feles flats, anchorage may be found, as already described, in Vauville or Sciotot bays, or under cape de Carteret. The best position at the latter place is in 4 or 5 fathoms, with the lighthouse just open westward of the fort on the western pitch of the cape, and distant about 2 miles. There is anchorage also farther South in Port Bail, St. Germain, and Regneville roads, but these can be used by small vessels only, as there are not more than from 2| to 3 fathoms in either at low water. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 From the northward, having passed through the Race, and having given the Nez de Jobourg a berth of at least 3 miles to avoid the Huquets de Jobourg, steer for cape Flamanville, and from thence, as the vessel advances southward, keep the perpendicular point of the Nez well open westward of cape Flamanville, so as to have cape de la Hague lighthouse also open of the Nez, which leads westward of the Basse Bihard, the outer patch of the Bane de Surtainville, and westward of the Roches-du-Rit. When abreast of the latter, port Bail and Gouey churches come in sight southward of cape de Carteret, then haul in gradually towards the land to avoid the Trois-Grunes and to shut in the north-western peak of the high light-coloured sand-hills of Hatainville with the dark, bluff, and nearly perpendicular point of cape de Carteret N. | E., which is the fairway mark between the Banes Feles and the coast, see also page 197, leading over the tail of these banks in from 8 to 12 feet at the lowest tides. If there is water enough to proceed, keep this leading mark on, passing 3 or 4 cables eastward of the red and black bell-buoy marking the Jourdan ridge, and westward of the foul ground off the Senequet rock lighthouse ; but, in passing this foul ground, the vessel must haul to the westward a little and Hatainville sand-hills must be again opened out. Cape Flamanville on with cape de Carteret leads just clear south eastward of the tail of the Banes Feles in deeper water than on the leading mark given ; but, if this latter mark is used, directly the banks have been passed the Hatainville sand-hills should be brought on with cape de Carteret as before.

V. 216 GRANVILLE TO CAPE DE LA HAGUE. and the foul ground off the Senequet, but at this distance Rosel point, having high land behind it, is not always well defined. When passing the Senequet rock, having hauled to the westward as described, steer to bring Champeaux point just open of pointe du Roc, Granville, bearing South, which, if the state of the tide and the vessel's draught admit, leads up to pointe du Roc, in-shore of the Catheue banks ; but, as the vessel advances southward, if there is not sufficient water over the banks, look out for the remarkable trees on Mont Huchon, about 2 miles northward of Coutances, and do not bring them on with Agon church until the Etat and Huguenans beacon turrets, Chausey, are in line bearing S. by W. J W. This mark leads westward of Catheue banks, and when Coutances cathedral comes on with Bee d'Agon or Agon point, steer towards Granville, and, after passing the Canue rock, keep the Etat well open northward of it until Mont St. Michel is within twice its width of Champeaux point bearing S. \u00a3 E., 01 until Coutances cathedral is on with Mont Martin church N.E. by E., either of which marks lead eastward of the Admiralty bank. When Chausey lighthouse, opening southward of the iles des Huguenans, touches the Chapelle rock W. by N. \\ N., haul up for it to avoid the Haguet bank, or anchor if there is not sufficient water to enter Granville. As early as 2 hours' flood there will be 11 feet over the Catheue, the Founet, and the Haguet banks. French pilots generally proceed through the Cotentin passage as follows : \u2014 By day, run through Alderney Race if possible during the last of the north-eastern stream ; then, if the vessel's draught be not too great to pass without risk between the Banes Feles and the land at low water, steer to the southward for cape Flamanville, and, passing it, bring Jobourg church steeple on with the extreme of the cape N. by E. \u00a3 E. ; this mark kept very carefully on leads eastward of the Basse Bihard, and of the Caillou rock, and over the Bane de Surtainville in not less than 3 fathoms. When the steeples of Port Bail and Gouey open of cape de Carteret steer S.S.E. so as to be about 2\\ miles from that cape when it is on with cape Flamanville bearing North.

In case the Jourdan bell-buoy should be out of position, she will be certain of passing eastward of that shoal by keeping the Hatainville sand-hills shut in by cape de Carteret. As soon as Coutances cathedral is on with Blainville church, steer S.W. between the Marie ledge and the northern extreme of the Catheue banks, and continue on this course until Agon church tower is on with Mont Huchon, or until the beacon turrets on the Huguenans and the Etat are made out ; when, kept in line, they lead up in the fairway. If bound to Granville, run on with these beacon turrets in line until the Tombelaine rock is well open of Champeaux point S. | E. ; keep it so, and after passing the Founet red bell-buoy, steer for the harbour according to wind and tide. The last mark given is generally used by the pilots, as they consider it leads in the deepest water over the sandy bed north-westward of Granville and over the bar which unites pointe du Roc with the Chausey islets, and also clears the dangers eastward of these islets as well as those surrounding pointe du Roc. At Night, when through Alderney Race, and having given the Nez de Jobourg a berth of at least 3 miles, steer towards cape Flamanville ; as that cape is approached, keep cape de la Hague light opening and shutting in with the Nez N. by E., which mark leads a safe distance westward of the Basse Bihard, but directly towards the Trois-Grunes. To avoid these latter, when cape de Carteret light bears S.E. by S. steer towards it on that bearing for 1^ miles, when the vessel will be about 3^- miles from the light and 1^ miles from the north-western edge of the Roches-du-Rit. From thence, steer S. by W. until the light bears E.

Cotentin passage from the southward.\u2014 Vessels from Granville bound to harbours eastward of cape de la Hague or on the northern side of the English channel, if their draught admits and with a leading wind, generally run through the Cotentin passage. For this purpose, Granville harbour should be left directly the vessel floats, and, as there is then plenty of water inside the Catheue banks, when clear of the foul ground surrounding pointe du Roc, she may haul to the eastward until Champeaux point is just open of pointe du Roc, which mark should be kept on astern until Coutances cathedral appears half way between Agon and Blainville churches. Or, she may take the outer passage by keeping Tombelaine islet a little open of Champeaux point, which mark leads westward of the Catheue banks, and eastward of the Founet and other ledges of the Chausey group, until the Etat and Huguenans beacon turrets are in line bearing S. by W. \u00a3 W., which mark kept on astern is the only one which can be used with safety at low water, springs, and which leads in mid-channel between the Catheue banks and Basse le Marie. When Coutances cathedral is on with Agon church tower, haul in towards the land, steering about N.E. to pass between the Jourdan ridge and the foul ground off the Senequet. A good look-out should now be kept for the Jourdan red and black bell-buoy, and, when seen, steer to pass a little eastward of it. If the weather is clear, Hatainville sand-hills shut in with cape de Carteret N. \u00a7 E., when cape Flamanville will be half a point open westward of cape de Carteret, leads clear of the Jourdan and B\u0153uf patch and up to the tail of the Banes Feles.

When abreast of St. Germain, steer North or a little more westerly, to bring capes de Carteret and Flamanville in line before reaching the parallel of the entrance to Surville. These capes in line, lead up to cape de Carteret, but as soon as the steeple of St. Pierre-les-Moutiers is on with the slope of the eastern part of the hill of cape de Carteret N.E. by N., or when within about 2 miles of the cape, steer N.W. until the Nez de Jobourg is a quarter of a point open westward of cape Flamanville, or until Jobourg church steeple is on with the extreme of cape Flamanville N. by E. \\ E. ; either of which marks, followed exactly, lead over the Bane de Surtainville in from 2 to 3 fathoms and up to an anchorage in Sciotot bay ; should Vauville bay be preferred, give cape Flamanville a berth of 8 cables in rounding, to avoid the rocks and overfalls off it, and take up a berth according to the direction of the wind ; see pages 207-210, and 214. The southern stream begins to be felt off cape Flamanville about 2?j hours later than in the south-eastern entrance to the Cotentin passage, whence it follows that a vessel in running through this passage 2 hours before high water at Granville and sailing at the rate of 6i or 7 knots, will, at springs, reach cape Flamanville or the anchorage in Sciotot bay before the southern stream makes. But at neaps this passage can rarely be accomplished in one tide by a sailing vessel, unless with a strong leading wind. The anchorage abreast of St. Germain should then be resorted to during the southern stream, and directly it slacks proceed under all sail so as to reach the Race of Alderney and take full advantage of the north-eastern stream, which is of great assistance if bound eastward. At Night, leaving Granville and bound northward, steer with Granville light on a S. by E. f E. bearing, midway between the Admiralty and Catheue banks. When Chausey light bears S.W. by S. keep it so, and steer N.E. by N. in the fairway between the Shamrock knoll and Marie ledge, and also between the Jourdan ridge and the foul ground off the Senequet rock, checking the vessel's position by cross bearings of Senequet and Granville lights.

CHANNEL ISLANDS; JERSEY, WITH ITS APPROACHES AND ADJACENT DANGERS. VARIATION in 1897, 16\u00b0 50' W. GENERAL REMARKS.\u2014 A section of Jersey, if taken from North to South, would decline nearly in the form of a wedge, of which the highest part would be the northern shore, whereas a section of Guernsey would decline in a contrary direction, or from South to North ; yet these distinguishing features do not immediately appear on sighting these islands from the westward. Seen from that direction, at a distance, both islands appear level ; the low land of Braye du Valle in Guernsey, and that of St. Clement in Jersey, being yet below the horizon. The outline of Guernsey, however, is some what more irregular than that of Jersey, and its western shore has more verdure, and appears of a deeper shade than Jersey, whose western shores have suffered considerably from the encroachments of the sea sand ; so much so, that the colour of the land between Corbiere and Etac points is affected by it.* Both islands may be seen in clear weather from a distance of 25 miles. As they are approached from the westward, however, the northerly slope of the land in Guernsey, as contrasted with its southerly slope in Jersey, should prevent the possibility of either island being mistaken for the other. Winds and weather. \u2014 The prevailing winds of the English channel, see page 2, are those which affect the weather of the Channel islands ; local causes, however, produce certain modifications, and it may be useful to give the result of local observation and experience. Winds from S.S.E. round by South to W.N.W. are prevalent during the winter months, and the latter predominate ; fortunately, against the severity of this wind both Jersey and Guernsey offer good shelter for shipping. During the summer months and equinoxes, the winds are variable and uncertain. * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 -Channel islands, Nos. 2,669 a, b ; scale, m = 0'5 inch \u2014 and, Jersey island, No. 62 a, b, and c with views ; scale, m = l-0 inche=."], [250, "222 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. When easterly winds set in during the winter season, they are thought to last longer and to blow with more uniformity in this neighbourhood than elsewhere. Southerly and south-westerly winds, during that period, are almost always accompanied or followed by stormy weather, which seldom or never clears up until the wind veers to North-west, as it usually does. The weather in the vicinity of Alderney does not always correspond with that at Jersey and Guernsey ; it being frequently local or peculiar to itself, owing perhaps to its proximity to the north-western angle of the French coast at Cape de la Hague, or to the island being in the very vortex of the tides, which are there in a constant state of rotation, especially at new and full moon. At those times, a difference of four points in the direction of the wind has been experienced, viz., an E. by N. wind at Guernsey and Sark, and a N.E. by N. wind at Alderney, both blewing at the same time, whilst the south-western stream was running, lightly or moderately, in the neighbourhood of the former, though near Alderney vessels were under double-reefed sails. During the north-eastern stream, the wind has often been observed to be S.W. by W. at Alderney, whilst at Herm it was West, with similar variety in strength ; and this without any difference in the barometer at the two places, or any perceptible cause, the attraction of the tides or deflection caused by the French coast-line excepted. Southerly, south-easterly, northerly, and north-easterly winds also invariably blow from Alderney in strong irregular gusts ; more particularly the first and last. Gales from S.W. and N.W. send in the heaviest sea amongst the islands, to which the strength of the tidal streams greatly contributes ; the worst period is from half flood to half ebb, after which the west going stream keeps much of the sea out in the offing. Refraction. \u2014 To show the variable effects of refraction caused by atmospheric conditions it may be noticed that from a station near Verclut guard-house in Jersey, the top of the south-eastern battlement of Seymour tower should exactly coincide with the line of the visible horizon at low water, equinoctial spring tides ; sometimes, however, when viewed from this position, it has appeared considerably below that line, and in several instances above it. In this case the line of sight passes over the rocky surface of the Violet bank, over the sandy See charts, Nos. 2,669 a and b."], [251, "Chap. VI.] WEATHER.\u2014 APPROACHES. \u2014 SOUNDINGS. 223 strand in its vicinity, and over the sea beyond, being at a mean height of 64 feet above it. Similar variations in refraction have been observed on the French coast opposite, between the steeples of Coutances cathedral and the summits of the trees in that neighbour hood, and also in the vicinity of Cancale. The Approaches to the Channel islands present peculiar diffi culties to the stranger. The outlying rocks fronting their coasts, the strength and ever varying direction of the tidal stream, and the rough sea occasioned by it in bad weather, are all elements of danger ; the mariner may, however, overcome these difficulties by careful study of the charts and attention to the sailing directions. Soundings. \u2014 Near and between the Channel islands there is nothing remarkable in the soundings, either in depth or quality of ground, to assist the mariner uncertain of his position. But, for vessels approaching from the westward in thick weather, it may be useful to note the following facts : viz., that a depth of 35 fathoms keeps a vessel in the offing, outside or westward of the Roches- Douvres and Guernsey ; that there are as much as 33 fathoms between Guernsey and the Casquets, close to the Casquet S.W. bank on which there are as little as 4 fathoms ; and that, although small gravel knolls may be occasionally heaped up near Hurd's Deep by the com bined action of gales and tides, on which as little as 20 fathoms may have been found at times, such knolls, if and when they exist, may be easily distinguished from the large banks near and amongst the islands by their inferior size and by the greater surrounding depths. An increase of depth from 40 to 50, or to 65 fathoms, indicates a position N.W. of Guernsey, somewhere in the western part of Hurd's Deep ; and, depths of from 70 to nearly 100 fathoms are obtained only northward of the Casquets and Alderney, in the eastern part of the Deep. The bottom of Hurd's Deep is remarkable for large patches of black mud, although there is also much rocky ground and other substances. Between the Deep and the islands, and amongst them, the ground has no distinctive character, but consists of rock, gravel, granitic sand, and other coarse ground ; near the banks, however, and round their bases, it is generally of fine sand. Eastward of the Channel islands, from Alderney down to Jersey, the soundings are a safe guide in approaching the French coast to within a reasonable distance. A line drawn from the eastern end of See charts, Nos. 2,669 a and b."], [252, "[Chap. VI. 224 CHANNEL ISLANDS. one to the other of these islands is nearly parallel with the French coast and distant from it abc ut 9 miles ; at the northern part of this line, near Alderney, there are 23 fathoms over clean ground, de creasing to 15 or 16 fathoms as Jersey is approached, with some deeper water, coarse rotten ground, and occasionally oyster beds. Eastward of this line, the water shoals very gradually towards the French coast, and southward of Jersey the numerous reefs render all approach to that coast very hazardous. Heavy gales cause considerable temporary alterations in the out lying sand-banks and exposed beaches of the islands ; south-westerly gales heaping up large quantities of sand and shingle, and north easterly gales washing them away again. It is well known that the Chateau and Ecreviere banks, eastward of Jersey, vary in height as much as 6 feet from this cause ; and, it is probable, therefore, that the Bane de la Schole, the Casquet banks, and others, vary from similar causes. All these variable banks, however, consist of fine sand and gravel, with sharp narrow ridges ; they are not, therefore, very dangerous to shipping, except from the confused sea and tide ripples over them in bad weather. TIDAL STREAMS.*\u2014 Near Guernsey, and northward of that island, the true Channel stream prevails ; the great body of the flood running about E. by N. whilst the tide is rising at Dover, and the ebb W.S.W. when it is falling at that place ; but, near to and south eastward of the Roches-Douvres, the flood stream begins to run S.E. into the gulf of St. Malo an hour after low water by the shore, and the ebb stream N.W. out of it an hour after high water by the shore ; the changes of stream in this vicinity being therefore near the time of half flood and half ebb at Dover. Thus what is called tide and half tide prevails at Guernsey and amongst the islands to the N.E., whilst at Jersey, and along the southern shore of the gulf, as well as westward near the Roches- Douvres the stream is more regular ; the former resulting from the direct action of the channel stream, the latter from an interruption of the southern portion of that stream by the coast of France, and its diversion into the gulf of St. Malo. The centre of the Deroute channel, between the Roches-Douvres and Guernsey, may be considered to mark the separating boundary See charts, Nos. 2,669 a and b. * See also Tidal streams, pages 298-301, and 305- 309 ; also Tide Table, page 60."], [253, "Chap. VI.] 225 TIDAL STREAMS. of these two streams, for, along this line and to the eastward they run side by side, blending and separating in varying direction and force according to the state of the tide. It should also be noted that around and between the Channel islands the streams change in direction by a rotary motion from right to left, the changes being apparently caused by the differences in the action of the two streams just described, and by the peculiar form of the shores of the gulf ; that is to say, the direction of the stream makes a complete circuit of the compass in a little over 12 hours, or in the duration of an ebb and a flood tide. It is also worthy of remark that the action of the streams near the northern and southern parts of the gulf, are nearly the reverse of each other ; there being slack water from Roches- Douvres eastward along the southern shores of the gulf when the stream is running at its maximum rate northward of cape de la Hague and Alderney, and vice versa. Whilst the water is falling at Dover and about the first quarter flood by the shore at Guernsey, the stream sets sharply into the gulf on both sides of the island, and continues to run in south-eastward until half flood by the shore, and slack and change of stream in the offing, both of which occur almost simultaneously with low water at Dover. A division of the Deroute stream now takes place ; the northern part sweeping E.N.E. through the Deroute, Russell, Swinge, and Race channels, and then uniting with the east-going Channel stream northward of Alderney ; the southern part, near the Roches-Douvres, setting into the gulf south-eastward past Jersey and the Minquiers until near high water by the shore ; after which, although the main body of the stream to the southward slacks, its northern border turns off north-eastward past Jersey and then northward, rejoining the Deroute stream. Close along the southern shore of the gulf, the ebb stream begins to run out westward soon after high water ; farther out in the Channel, but within the Roches-Douvres, an hour later ; at a position 8 miles N.W. of the Roches-Douvres, the stream changes at 2 hours ebb ; and, farther northward, near Guernsey, as already noticed, the slack and change of stream take place soon after half ebb by the shore, at which time also the south-western stream makes down through the Race, Swinge, and Russell channels, and through the Deroute channel between the Pierres de Lecq or Paternosters and Serk. In the offing westward of Guernsey, the stream seldom exceeds 3 knots until that island is approached, near which it sometimes See charts, Nos. 2,669 a and b."], [254, "[Chap. VI. 226 CHANNEL ISLANDS. attains the rate of 4^ knots. In the Russell channels, it exceeds 5 knots, and it runs at about the same rate between Jersey and the Minquiers, and nearly 4 knots in the centre of the Deroute channel between Jersey and Serk. The Race and Swinge streams sometimes attain the rate of 7 knots or more. The average duration of the north-eastern stream is 5| hours, and of the south-western stream 6f hours. The rapidity with which the tides rise and fall, and their velocity, are greatly influenced by the wind ; strong north-eastern gales retarding and south-western gales accelerating- their progress in a very remarkable degree. South-westerly gales also cause the Race stream to run three quarters of an hour longer north-eastward than it otherwise would do, though north-easterly gales have not a similar effect upon the south-western stream. The tides put in and take off in all this neighbourhood very sud denly, and the general run of springs takes place about half an hour earlier than neaps ; the strength and direction of the wind making a difference of 2 or 3 feet in the rise and fall of the tide. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Helier, Jersey, at 6h. 29m., mean spring range 31^ feet ; at Guernsey at 6h. 37m., mean spring range 26 feet ; and, at Alderney, 6h. 46m., mean spring range 17\u00a3 feet. Caution. \u2014 In approaching the Channel islands, constant and careful allowance should be made for the set of the tidal stream. If from the westward, and being southward of the parallel of Alderney, a south-easterly set may with certainty be expected, which will increase in intensity as Guernsey is neared ; and, between that island and the Roches-Douvres, a considerable indraught is always found, especially with north-westerly gales. Should a vessel happen to be near the islands during a long winter's night, but westward withal, the following observations are worth consideration. With northerly, north-westerly, or westerly winds, it is not prudent to lay her head north-eastward between low water and half flood unless the depth of water exceeds 34 fathoms, because at that time both wind and tide unite in driving the ship south-eastward. With southerly, south-westerly, or westerly winds, it is equally imprudent to lay a vessel's head south-eastward between half flood and high water, and for a similar reason, both wind and tide then driving her north-eastward.

VI.] TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 JERSEY, GENERAL REMARKS. 227 With easterly winds the islands become a weather shore, and may consequently be made free with as occasion may require ; and, by attention to the set of the streams, a position taken before dark may be preserved within 3 or 4 miles, if a vessel can carry close-reefed topsails and foresail ; what is lost on one tide being nearly regained on the other, if the wind enables her to lie across either. This calculation may be made with a fair degree of certainty off St. Malo, Granville, or cape Flamanville. When making the Casquets or any of the rocks or islands in thick, foggy weather, never run close home with the stream, but wait until the turn of the tide would set you off-shore in the event of getting suddenly into danger. In westerly gales, avoid passing close to windward of any of the banks on a weather tide ; and, it is well to remember that at such times, with the western stream running in the offing, there is a very heavy sea westward of the islands, but comparatively smooth water within them and along the coast of France ; so that a vessel leaving Alderney at 2 hours' ebb, and pushing through the Race before the W.S.W. stream makes down, may run a considerable distance towards Jersey in smooth water. On entering or leaving any of the narrow channels between the islands, be careful to make early allowance for the different sets of tidal stream sure to be met with at such places. JERSEY, ITS APPROACHES AND ADJACENT DANGERS. GENERAL REMARKS.\u2014 The form of Jersey is that of a parallelogram, its greatest length E.S.E. and W.N.W. being 9-J- miles and its breadth 5| miles. The middle of the island, in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, presents a uniform level surface about 280 feet above the mean height of the sea, its northern shore being from 100 to 150 feet higher. Jersey thus, as already described, slopes to the southward, and to this circumstance may probably be attributed the pre-eminence it enjoys in the richness of its pro ductions, its luxuriance, and the peculiar mildness of its climate. Granite and syenitic rocks are the principal formations. See chart, No. 2,669 b."], [256, "[Chap. VI. 228 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. The interior is well wooded, fertile, and intersected by deep and beautiful valleys running from South to North, through which numerous streams find their way to the low land on the southern coast ; several occasionally uniting before discharging themselves into the sea. Jersey possesses several good bays or roadsteads besides its artificial harbours. The best anchorages are in Gorey roads on the eastern side of the island, and in St. Aubin bay on its southern coast ; in either of these, a well-found ship may ride out the heaviest gales from any quarter. The principal artificial harbour, fully described at page 240, is that of St. Helier, the chief town of the island, at the eastern side of St. Aubin bay. There are also smaller harbours at St. Aubin on the western side of the bay, at Gorey, at Rozel, and at other places, but they all dry at low water, springs. Jersey has its own legislature, the States consisting of the Lieut. - Governor and the Bailiff of the Royal Court, appointed by the Crown ; twelve Jurats (Judges) of the Royal Court, elected for life by the ratepayers ; the Rectors of the twelve Parishes into which the island is divided, and the Constables of the same ; also a Deputy for each parish, St. Helier having three Deputies, elected in the same manner but for three years only. Appeals lie to the Queen in Council. This island, like Guernsey and Alderney, is, for ecclesiastical purposes, in the diocese of Winchester. Each parish has its own church, the spires of which serve as the principal landmarks. The English language is much used, but the old Norman French is that chiefly spoken, the large number of French residents, as well as the employment of great numbers of French workpeople, especially during the potato season, tending to sustain the use of the French language. The population of the island, according to the census of 1891, amounted to 54,518 ; of which number, about 28,000 form the population of St. Helier. A great part of the island is laid out in orchards, cider and apples being among its chief exports ; Jersey cattle, as also granite, red gravel, china clay, vegetables, and fruit are exported, and early potatoes are raised in large quantities for the London market. The chief imports are grain, flour, and cattle from France ; and, timber from Sweden, Norway, and North America. See chart, No. 2.669 b."], [257, "Chap.

PILOTS. \u2014 The following is extracted from the Law on Pilotage issued by the States of the island of Jersey in January, 1857, and still in force : \u2014 \" The master of every vessel bound to this island, and arrived one mile West of the Corbiere rock, shall lay his vessel to, as soon as a pilot is in sight, and take a pilot on board as soon as one presents himself, on pain of paying such pilot the highest rate of pilotage. \" Fishing-boats and vessels admeasuring forty tons and less shall not be liable to take a pilot, but all other vessels employed in the coasting trade shall be liable to do so, paying half the pilotage dues when it has been ascertained that they are employed in the coasting trade only, unless it be otherwise provided by the tariff. \" When the weather is so stormy as to prevent a pilot from boarding a vessel at sea, the master of such vessel and the pilot shall so steer that the pilot boat may take the lead and serve as a guide, and such vessel shall be liable to the same pilotage dues as if the pilot had boarded her. \"Any pilot passing a vessel coming to the island shall be liable to a penalty of five pounds sterling, unless such vessel have already a pilot on board, or the weather is so stormy as to prevent the pilot boarding her. \" Every pilot shall have a flag striped horizontally red and white, 6 feet long and 4 wide, which, on boarding a vessel and taking charge, he shall direct the master thereof to hoist at the peak as a signal that a pilot is on board, under the penalty of five pounds sterling against the master refusing to do so. \" Any pilot undertaking to pilot a vessel ! 1, when required so to do, exhibit to the master or mate of such ves<! \u00bb1 his warrant, together with this law and tariff annexed thereto, under the penalty of thirty shillings.\" ASPECT OF JERSEY.*\u2014 The first objects distinguishable on approaching Jersey from the westward are, the churches of St. Peter and St. Ouen, St. Ouen windmill with St. Peter's barracks, an * See views on Admiralty chart, Jersey, No. 62 c."], [258, "230 [Chap. VI CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. extensive range of buildings on the sandy heights, and now and then the spire of St. Mary's church, together with Prince's tower or Hougue Bie, appear among the trees in the interior of the island. St. Peter and St. Ouen churches stand high : the spire of the former is lofty, the latter has only a tower. On a nearer view, the lighthouse on the Corbiere rock and then Rocco fort and tower, the three mar tel lo towers, square fort, and magazine on the sandy beach in St. Ouen bay present themselves, as also the tower on l'Etac point and the remarkable rock, known as the Pinnacle, between that point and Grosnez point ; and finally, the declining land to the south-eastward, with its well-wooded surface and its shore of sand and rock. Jersey is encompassed by dangers rendered doubly formidable by the great rise and fall, as well as by the rapidity, of the tides. On the north-western and western sides are the Bane Desormes, Rigdon bank, and the shoals surrounding the Corbiere rock ; but the most remarkable are, the Pierres de Lecq or Pater-Nosters, the Drouilles, and the Ecrehos, on the northern and north-eastern sides ; the Violet bank surrounding the south-eastern angle ; and the Minquiers ledge, from 7 to 10 miles distant, with many other rocks, fronting the whole of its southern shores. PLATEAU DES MINQUIERS.\u2014 For the description of this tangled mass of reefs, see Chap. V., page 153. The descriptions of the other reefs and shores of the island com mencing on the N.W., with the Bane Desormes, follow successively the western, southern, eastern, and northern coasts. Bane Desormes, 3^ miles N. i W. from Grosnez point, and the same distance from the highest of the Pierres de Lecq rocks, is a bank of rocky ground one mile long N.N.W. and S.S.E. and 3 cables wide ; the depths are generally from 12 to 15 fathoms, except near its extremes, where are two conical masses of rock, that on the northern end having 23 feet water, and that on the southern end 7^ fathoms. The latter bears from the former S.S.E. 1\\ cables. On the 23-feet rock, which is small and pointed, with from 9 to 12 fathoms close around, the white Semaphore house on La Moye is only just shut in behind the outer part of Pinnacle point, South ; and, the south-western high rock of the Pierres de Lecq shut in with Belle Hougue point, nearly to the outer part of its high bluff, bears S.E. \\ E.

J W. leads eastward of the Bane Desormes. GROSNEZ POINT is the high precipitous bluff at the north western extreme of (he island ; from it, St. Martin's point, Guern sey, the nearest point of that island, bears N.N.W. \u00a7 W. 14| miles. On the summit of the point are the ruins of an old fort. From Grosnez point, the land trends eastwards towards Plemont point and the northern side of Jersey, and southward towards St. Ouen bay ; in this direction, the coast continues high and rugged nearly as far as l'Etac point, southward of which the high land recedes from the shore. ST. OUEN BAY is the indentation on the western coast of Jersey between l'Etac point and the Corbiere. As already described, its shores are low and sandy, but quickly rising to the level of the plateau of the interior. Southward of St. Peter's barracks, stand ing conspicuously on the high land, is the Quenvais, an extensive district covered with sand and forming a remarkable feature on this coast. Anchorage. \u2014 St. Ouen bay affords good shelter in easterly winds, but no vessel should anchor in it with the wind from the westward. The greater part of the bay being rocky and foul, the anchorage is limited to a space about half a mile square near the southern part, between the Great bank and Rocco tower ; here a vessel is well sheltered from the tide, and may lie in about 7 fathoms, sandy bottom, with St. Ouen mill a little open northward of the square fort on the beach, between Nos. 2 and 3 towers, bearing E.N.E. The anchorage is easy of access and may be safely entered by large vessels without pilots. An extensive reef, dry at low water, stretches off 7 cables west ward of the Rocco tower, and from thence extends alongshore southward in the direction of the Corbiere rock, which it unites with Corbiere point ; the whole of this reef is covered before high water except a small rocky mass near the middle, of which the Flat and Sharp rocks are the highest heads. Between the Rocco tower and l'Etac, there is a fine beach of white sand, but, at low water, it is See chart, No. 62 c. I' S 0 11886"], [260, "232 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. fringed with rocks throughout, and off l'Etac point it dries out 1\\ cables ; the greater part covers before half flood and no part is visible at high water. Rigdon bank, of which the outer edge is nearly 2 miles west ward of l'Etac point, consists of rocky ridges, the interstices being filled up with sand and gravel ; it is about a mile long, E.N.E. and W.S.W., and 2 cables wide. The general depth is from 3 to 5 fathoms but two rocks have only 11 feet over them ; of these, one is near the middle, the other at the north-eastern extreme. The bank is very steep-to on the outside, and between it and the Etac reef is the Swashway channel, about 3 cables wide, with a general depth of 6 fathoms ; this channel is frequently used by vessels of from 200 to 300 tons. Plemont and Grosnez points in line E. \\ S. lead northward of Rigdon bank. La Moye white Semaphore house midway between Flat and Sharp rocks S.S.E., or St. Peter's spire open southward of No. 2 martello tower S.E. by E., leads south-westward ; and, St. Peter's spire open eastward of No. 1 martello tower S.E. leads north-eastward of it. The best leading mark through the Swashway between Rigdon bank and the Etac reef is, the highest heads of the Pierres de Lecq or Paternoster rocks about half a point open of Grosnez bluff N.E. by E. \\ E. West rock, sometimes called Grey bank, is 1^ miles westward of Rigdon bank ; it is a mass of rock, very steep on the outside, 1^ cables long N.E and S.W., and more than a cable wide, on which are from 7 to 10 fathoms except near the middle where there are only 6 fathoms. From this spot, St. Peter's spire a little open northward of the small square fort on the beach bears S.E. by E. \\ E. easterly ; and, the highest, or Great rock, of the Pierres de Lecq is open 8\u00b0 of Grosnez bluff, which bluff and the Corbiere rock subtend an angle of 72\u00b0. The shoal part is well marked near low water by a strong ripple. The channel between West rock and Rigdon bank is more than a mile wide, quite clear, and has from 12 to 17 fathoms water. Great bank extends N.N.W. \\ W. \\\\ miles from the Corbiere rock, and is 3 cables wide. It consists entirely of sand and has from See chart, No. 62 c."], [261, "Chap. VI.] 233 SHOALS.\u2014 CORBIERE ROCK, LIGHT. 7 to 9 fathoms except at two spots where are narrow ridges of fine sand with as little as 5 or 5} fathoms. The outer ridge is at the northern extreme of the bank, close to deep water, and is about 2 cables long E.S.E. and W.N.W. ; its centre bears N.N.W. \u00a7 W. H miles from Corbiere lighthouse. The inner ridge is similar to the outer, but only about half the length ; its centre bears N.W. \\ N. 9 cables from Corbiere lighthouse. Between the ridges, there is a good channel in to the anchorage, 5 cables wide, with regular soundings of from 8 to 9 fathoms, sand. St. Ouen mill a third of the distance between No. 2 tower and the small square fort on the beach, E. by N. \\ N., touches the northern extreme of the Great bank. The Jument, a whitewashed rock 31j cables eastward of the Corbiere, touching the inner side of the Corbiere S.E. \\ S. leads westward ; and, the Jument on with the high-water rock midway between Corbiere rock and point, S.S.E. \\ E. leads eastward. St. Ouen mill a little open northward of the square fort E.N.E. leads over the bank, midway between the two shoal ridges, in 9 fathoms water. Corbiere point, at the south-western end of Jersey, is a low bluff with a flagstaff on the summit and two small houses at its side. Just within the point the land rises at a steep slope and unites with the high table land of La Moye. CORBIERE ROCK, 2 cables westward of the point and connected with it by a reef which dries after the last quarter ebb, is 70 feet above hisrh water and very remarkable. It stands prominently out from the coast-line and is the principal landmark for vessels approaching from the westward. On it is a lighthouse, and a signal station which is in telegraphic communication with St. Helier ; it may be seen in clear weather 10 or 12 miles distant. From it, the N.W. light-buoy of the Minquiers shoals bears about S.S.W. \\ W. llf miles ; and, Hanois lighthouse N.N.W. | W. 23^ miles. LIGHT. \u2014 From a circular stone lighthouse 62 feet high, on the Corbiere rock, is exhibited, at 119 feet above high water, a fixed white light visible 17 miles round seaward between S. 15\u00b0 E. and N. 15\u00b0 W. Between S. 15\u00b0 E. and the land, the light shows red; also between N. 15\u00b0 W. and N. 48\u00b0 W. over the Vracheres and the adjacent dangers ; but between N. 48\u00b0 W. and the shore, it shows ivhite. Fog signal. \u2014 During fogs a bell is sounded three times in quick succession at intervals of ten seconds. An explosive signal making- See chart, No. 62 c. P 2 S O 11886"], [262, "234 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. a loud report is also fired near the base of the lighthouse every half hour. This latter signal may be sometimes given more frequently in answer to pre-arranged signals with the mail steamers. Caution. \u2014 Mariners must be very careful when navigating within the limits of either sector of red light. The principal dangers off and near the Corbiere are the Green rock, the Boiteaux, Boue, Frouquie, and Noirmontaise rocks. Green rock, the outer danger, has 11 feet water ; it bears N.W by W. \\ W. 6f cables from Corbiere lighthouse and 2 cables from the Boiteaux rocks on the same line of bearing. The marks for it are, St. Ouen mill just eastward of No. 3 martello tower N.E. by E. ; and, the Jument rock on with La Moye Point S.E. by E. Another rock, with only 8 feet water, lies E.N.E one cable from the Green rock. The Boiteaux are two rocks only 60 yards apart between the Green rock and the Corbiere ; they uncover 9 feet distant 4f cables from the Corbiere. From the southern Boiteaux, St. Ouen church is open southward of the Magazine on the beach of St. Ouen bay N.E. by E. ; and, La Moye white Semaphore house is on with the northern side of the peak of the Corbiere rock S.E. by E. | E. The Boue rock bears N.W. 3| cables from Corbiere lighthouse and uncovers 20 feet, or rather before half ebb ; it is at the inner part of the sunken reef in-shore of the Boiteaux. The Frouquie is at the outer edge of the reef extending from Rocco tower and fort to the Corbiere, from which latter it bears N. -5 W. 5 cables ; and, from the Boue rock N.E. 3 cables. The Frouquie covers 6 feet at high water, springs. Noirmontaise reef lies 2\\ cables westward of the Corbiere, and dries 4 feet at low water. Another reef, one cable westward of the Corbiere, has 4 feet only over its shoalest part ; and, a large rock S. by E. one cable from the Corbiere uncovers after the first quarter ebb.

The clearing marks for the outer and inner parts of the Great bank, see page 233, are the best leading marks by which to enter this pass from the northward ; for, should both the Boue and Frouquie rocks be covered, a vessel cannot go too near the former so long as the Jument is in sight inside the Corbiere, nor can the Frouquie be touched without opening the Jument eastward of the high rock between Corbiere point and rock. There is a small rock 1^ cables westward of the Frouquie with only one foot water ; from it, the Jument rock and a beacon pole on the western side of the high rock between Corbiere point and rock are in line. With this exception, there is a clear 2i-fathoms passage more than a cable wide ; no vessel should, however, attempt to run through until half tide, that is to say, until the Boue rock is nearly awash ; it is then quite safe for vessels under 15 feet draught. At or above half tide, therefore, enter the pass midway between the Frouquie and Boue rocks, with the Jument midway between the Corbiere rock and the large rock off Corbiere point ; and, when St. Ouen church tower is on with the high rocky mass south-westward of Rocco tower N.E. \\ E. easterly, steer for the Corbiere rock until within one cable of it, when it must be rounded at a distance of 150 yards only ; and, run out to southward w-hen the Pinnacle rock is nearly on with the outer part of the Corbiere. There is a narrow deep-water channel between the Frouquie and the one-foot vjatch, also between the Green rock and the Boiteaux and between the Noirmontaise and Boue rocks, close to the Corbiere and leading to the Frouquie pass, but the space between the Boiteaux and Boue rocks, and from the latter to within one cable of the Corbiere, is so thickly studded with sunken rocks as to be very dangerous even for boats, at low water, and should be avoided. Jument rock, very useful as a sea-mark, has a large white patch painted on it ; from it, Corbiere lighthouse bears N.W. \\ W. 3^ cables ; and, it is one cable from the high bluff next eastward of Corbiere point, with which bluff it is connected by a reef dry at low water. About 100 yards outside the Jument is a dangerous rock which dries only at the last quarter ebb ; it should not be approached therefore nearer than 3 cables.

VI. 236 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. the Corbiere; on the high land behind the point is a conspicuous white Semaphore station, often alluded to in this work and very useful as a sea-mark. The quarries at La Moye, showing at a distance as a white mark in the bluff, are also useful in clearing the Minquiers reefs. La Moye point is safe of approach from the westward, but I-} cables off it is a rock with only 6 feet water ; close eastward of this rock and probably connected with it are the Kaines, a dangerous rocky group of which the highest covers only at the last quarter flood. The outer sunken rock of the Kaines lies 2-} cables from the shore. Corbiere lighthouse kept open southward of the Jument until Tabor chapel, St. Brelade bay, opens out eastward of Grosse Tete, leads clear of all these clangers. ST. BRELADE BAY, near the south-western end of Jersey, between La Moye and Le Fret points, is much contracted by the extensive reef fringing its eastern shore, and the anchorage is further cut up by the Fournier and Fourche rocks. There is always less sea on the western than on the eastern side of the bay, but it is very inferior to St. Aubin bay as an anchorage and more exposed to southerly gales ; nevertheless, small vessels, and even large open boats, anchored within it off port Bouilly, have been known to ride out fresh gales from this the most exposed quarter, the holding ground being remarkably good. Approaching St. Brelade bay from the westward, the most remark able objects seen are, Grosse Tete, the high square rock under the rugged land of La Moye on the western side of the bay ; and, Noirmont tower standing prominently out at the end of the low point, of that name to the eastward. On opening out the eastern side of the bay clear of Grosse Tete, the white sandy beach appears, and two martello towers, one on each side of Grouin point at the head of the bay ; beyond are villa residences and scattered groups of houses ; whilst, above all, on the high land near the middle of the bay, stands Tabor chapel, a plain white building with \"slate roof forming the principal landmark in it. Near the middle of the bay are the Fournier and Fourche rocks, about 2^ cables W.N.W. and E.S.E. from each other. The best anchorage is about a cable north-eastward of the Fournier ; the ground is quite clean up to the base of this rock, which is of very See charts, Nos. 62 b and e."], [265, "Chap. VI.] ST.

The other but less important rocks of the bay are, the Fournier du Havre, which dries 17 feet 2\u00a7 cables north-eastward of the Fournier ; the Plat Houmet, which dries 12 feet in the bight nearer the shore ; and, the Rousse rock, about 25 feet above high water level, with the Rousse-Frouquie just northward of it, on the eastern side and outer part of the bay. St. Brelade bank is an uneven bed of rocks, commencing 5 cables South of La Moye point and extending eastward about 4\u00a3 cables ; the least water, 29 feet, is near the eastern end of the bank. Le Fret bank, 3 cables off Le Fret point, is 1| cables in extent North and South, with from 25 to 29 feet water. Within 2^ cables north-westward of the bank are several rocks, having a least depth of 14 feet on them, and at 2 cables south-eastward of the bank is a patch with only 20 feet ; the marks for the 14-feet patch are, Noirmont tower E. | S. ; and, the western martello tower in St. Brelade bay on with Rousse-Frouquie N.N.E. Corbiere lighthouse on with La Moye point leads in-shore of Le Fret bank and of all these rocky patches ; and, Corbiere lighthouse a little southward of the Jument leads southward of them but over St. Brelade bank. Directions. \u2014 A vessel from the north-westward bound to St. Brelade or St. Aubin bay, on nearing the shore of Jersey, should keep Plemont point open of Grosnez point until Corbiere lighthouse bears eastward of S. by E. E. in order to clear the Rigdon shoal. When St. Peter's spire opens southward of No. 2 martello tower she will be southward of the shoal, and from thence should steer to round the Corbiere about a mile distant, avoiding the Green rock and other off- lying reefs by keeping St. Ouen windmill open northward of No. 3 martello tower in St. Ouen bay until La Moye white Semaphore house is on with Corbiere lighthouse.* When the white house opens south ward of the Jument rock E. by S. \\ S., or when the outer part of the high table land within Noirmont point is open of Le Fret point, a vessel is clear of the Noirmontaise reef and of all dangers south-west- See charts, Nos. 62 b and c.

Tabor chapel kept bearing N.E. \u00a7 N. leads up to the inner anchorage eastward of the Fournier rock. Anchor within the Fournier rock in from 4 to 5 fathoms, fine sand, on or between either of these lines, when La Moye bluff comes on with the outer part of Grosse Tete W. by N. Large vessels may anchor outside the Fournier in 8^ fathoms, gravel, with the western pass leading mark on, and the Jument rock just shut in with La Moye point. PORTELET BAY, between Le Fret and Noirmont point, is a bad anchorage ; it is small and still further contracted by rocks extending westward from Noirmont point, as well as from the centre of the bay westward of Janvrin tower, which, together with the rapidity of the tidal stream across the entrance, renders it dangerous of approach even for vessels of the smallest size. The danger is increased by Portelet ledge, an isolated mass of rock S.W. by S. 2^ cables from Janvrin tower ; from the shoalest spot of 2 feet on this ledge, La Moye white Semaphore house over a remarkable sharp-peaked rock semi-detached from Le Fret point bears N.W. W. ; and, Noirmont tower appears northward of the high part of Pierre au Poisson, which lies midway between that tower and the ledge. Noirmont tower southward of the Pierre au Poisson leads just southward of Portelet ledge. If compelled to anchor in Portelet bay, the best berth is in 4^ fathoms, sand, with La Moye point just shut in with Le Fret point, and Janvrin tower N.E.

South-westerly gales send in a heavy rolling sea between half flood and high water, but as the water falls the sea subsides, the rocks in the offing greatly contributing to break its force. The town and harbour of St. Helier occupy the north-eastern side of the bay, and the little town of St. Aubin, with its castle on a rock nearly 3 cables from the shore, is on the western side, opposite St. Helier ; their distance apart being about 2\\ miles. Both towns have stone pier harbours, St. Helier by far the larger and more important, where vessels lie aground at low water on soft muddy sand ; the tide, at low water, springs, receding 5 cables from St. Aubin harbour, and 100 yards outside the entrance of St. Helier new harbour. A strong mole or breakwater projects from the northern side of St. Aubin castle, sheltering a pier within, where vessels frequently refit and unload, grounding, however, at low water. Elizabeth castle is built on a craggy rock on the eastern side of the bay fronting the harbours of St. Helier, and about three quarters of a mile south-westward of the town ; moles or breakwaters extend both north-eastward and southward from it ; the top of its high central tower or keep is 105 feet above high water level. On the site of this castle formerly stood an Augustine monastery built in honour of St. Helier, a recluse, whose hermitage, on the summit of a high rock, 1^ cables southward of the castle, still exists. Elizabeth and St. Aubin castles are insulated every tide, but with their moles afford shelter respectively to the two harbours, by breaking the swell which rolls into St. Aubin bay during south westerly gales. ST. AUBIN HARBOUR.\u2014 Several rocks lie scattered south ward and westward of St. Aubin castle, most of which uncover at low water. The two largest and most conspicuous are the Grosse and the Platte, very close together and 1| cables from the castle ; the Grosse is the highest and shows about the first quarter ebb ; both rocks are marked by beacon poles. Another group of rocks lies 2 cables southward of the Grosse, the north-eastern head drying 7 feet at low water. Haule house open eastward of St. Aubin castle breakwater leads eastward of these rocks ; and, eastward of this line, the bottom is all fine sand.

The passage westward of St. Aubin castle is not passable even for boats until half flood. The population of the little town of St. Aubin is about 1,000. There is direct communication between it and St. Helier by railway. The chief import is coal and the only export red gravel. No stock of coal is kept on hand for shipping, the port of St. Helier being so near at hand. From 40 to 50 small vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 3,700 tons enter the port annually. Water of first rate quality may be procured from pumps on the quay of St. Aubin harbour. ST. HELIER, the chief town of Jersey, is built on low land open southward but overlooked and sheltered northward by a high semicircular plateau completely commanding it. The town is well built, and, as previously stated, contains about 28,000 in habitants. It has a college and several churches, whose spires, together with Fort Regent on the eastern side of the town, are the most prominent objects from the sea. A large general hospital is available for seamen in case of accident or illness. The English quarantine laws are in force, and vessels from the Mediterranean, Brazils, or from infected ports hoist the quarantine flag and are not permitted to enter the port until pratique has been granted by the Customs authorities. Communication. \u2014 Steamers run daily between Jersey, South ampton, and Weymouth all the year round, and frequently to London, Plymouth, Bristol, and other English ports ; and, during the summer, daily to Granville, St. Malo, St. Brieuc, port Bail, and de Carteret, in France ; and bi-weekly to Granville, St. Malo, and Brieuc, during the remainder of the year, the principal part of the Jersey trade being carried on by steamers. Upwards of 2,400 vessels entered the port of St. Helier in the year 1894, their tonnage being about 320,000 tons. St. Helier has a well-supplied market, where fresh meat and poultry may be purchased at about the same prices as in London. Fish is scarce, vegetables and fruit abundant and cheap. The principal imports are dead meat and bullocks for slaughter, coal, wheat, flour, timber, cement, artificial manures, &c. The exports are Jersey cows, granite, red gravel, fruit, new potatoes, &c. The agricultural exports alone realized close upon 5O0,00OZ. in 1891. See chart, No. 62 b."], [269, "Chap. VI.] ST. HELIER. \u2014 DEPTHS. 241 St. Helier harbours * are on the north-eastern side of St. Aubin bay. The Inner harbour is completely enclosed by the Outer harbour constructed between the years 1840-50 at a cost of 170,000?., from designs by Mr. J. Walker, C.E. Both are alike in form, the Outer harbour being in fact a repetition of the Inner on an extended scale ; they are nearly rectangular, narrow in proportion to their length, with the entrances near their south western corners. Depths, &C\u2014 The Inner harbour is about 1,900 feet long by 300 feet wide ; it dries 11 feet at the entrance and 25 feet at its northern end, and has 8 feet water at its entrance at half tide. The Outer harbour, enclosed by the Victoria and Albert piers, is 2,600 feet long by 500 feet wide ; at present, it dries 3 feet between the pier-heads and 17 feet at its northern end ; it has 16 feet in its entrance at half tide, 31^ feet at high water, springs, and about 23 feet at neaps ; the ground rises gradually within the pier-heads for a distance of about 300 feet where there are 3 feet less water ; the bottom is fine sand and mud throughout. New Works. \u2014 The new North Quay is completed, giving about 1,400 feet additional quay frontage, with deeper water alongside than at the other quays. A landing stage has been erected within the Victoria pier-head, and the Albert pier-head is in course of reconstruction, its foundations being carried down to the rock. When this is completed, dredging to the depth of 5 \"feet below the low water level is intended in order to give access to mail and passenger steamers at all times of tide. The dredging opera tions will include a channel from the Little road to the new North Quay and part of the Outer harbour. Dredging and other works were commenced as early as October, 1895 ; and a notice issued by the harbour authorities cautioning all masters and pilots to keep clear of dredgers, scaffolding, &c. Coal can always be obtained, though the stock on hand is usually not large, from 300 to 400 tons ; it is placed on board vessels along side the quays where the available depth at high water, neaps, is about 18 feet ; but, it must be borne in mind that, although from the great rise of tide the harbour is accessible at springs to vessels See chart, No. 62 *. * The works commenced in 1872 to enclose the two present harbours, and suspended in 1878, were resumed in 1887 so far as the Hermitage breakwater is concerned, but again discontinued in 1890.

LIGHTS. \u2014 The following fixed lights are exhibited for the guidance of vessels bound to St. Helier : \u2014 A ivhite light, from a gas lamp close to the edge of the quay on the Victoria pier. A small white light from the end of the Hermitage breakwater. A green light from an iron post on the western angle of the Albert pier, and a red light at its inner end on the esplanade parapet wall N.E. \\ N. 630 yards from the green light, and both visible 3 miles. These two lights in line lead through the middle of the Little road, between the Oyster and Dog's Nest rocks, and between the Cloches rocks, clear of all danger. The lights in line also lead between the Hinguette rock and Grune St. Michel, when they can be seen at that distance, care being taken to open them a little one way or the other to clear a rock in the fairway having only 7 feet water, and lying 2\\ cables south-west ward of the high head of the Hinguette.

It is nearly awash at high water, and its apex is marked by three white spots and is surmounted by a beacon consisting of an iron pole and ball. The principal rocks fronting the harbour and around the Little road of St. Helier, besides the Dog's Nest rock, are, the Cloches rocks, the Oyster rocks, Grune Moulet, the Platte, and the Sharp rock. Cloches rocks. \u2014 Buoy. \u2014 The Cloches are two sunken rocks immediately off the entrance to the Little road. The western Cloche has 8 feet water and is marked, close to, on its north-western side, by a black buoy with a white top, as a guide for vessels passing between it and the Oyster rock.

The Oyster rock uncovers 13 feet and lies S.W. \\ W. 1-| cables from the Hermitage breakwater end. The Oyster rock beacon is marked in 23 divisions of a foot each. When the rocks are awash, there are 10 feet water between the Victoria and Albert piers ; and, after the rocks are covered, the depth of water in feet between the piers may always be known by deduct ing thp number of divisions seen above water from 33. The Grune Moulet dries 11 feet ; its beacon is marked in 10 divisions of 2 feet each. Platte rock is within the entrance to the Little road E. by N. northerly exactly one cable from the Oyster rock beacon. It dries one foot, and is less than a cable from the present head of the Hermitage breakwater which is intended to be eventually extended to this rock. There is a small pole beacon on the Platte rock which, however, is covered and not visible at high water, springs. There is no safe channel between the Oyster and Platte rocks.

At low water, the Little road is com pletely sheltered eastward by the new pier building and by the rocky barrier, entirely dry, extending from point de Pas to the Dog's Nest rock, and westward by the Hermitage breakwater and the rocks extending to, and one cable beyond, the Oyster rock beacon. The best anchorage is north-westward of the Grande Mangeuse rock, in 10 feet water, with Fort Regent signal-post over the middle of the harbour entrance ; and, the south-western side of Close rock N.W. by W.

The available anchorage space is only 1-1- cables wide and 2 cables long, N.E. and S.W., and is surrounded by dangerous rocks ; see also directions, page 256. DANGERS Off St. AUBIN BAY.\u2014 The principal dangers to be avoided in approaching St. Aubin bay, in addition to the St. Brelade and Le Fret banks, described at page 237, are : on the western side, the Vracheres, the Hubaut with its surrounding rocks, the Grunes, the Grunes Vaudin, the Sillette rocks, the Fours, the Grimes aux Dardes, and Danger rock ; the Rouaudiere near the middle ; and, on the eastern side, the Grunes St. Michel, the Hin guette, Tetards, and Demie de Pas ; the Diamond rock near the centre of the bay, in line between the Noirmont tower and the outer Hermitage rocks ; the Pignonet, Grunes du Port, and Junees along the western shore ; the Baleine and other sunken rocks near the eastern shore off Elizabeth castle ; and, the Cloches, already described, off the entrance to St. Helier Little road. Some of the passages between these rocks are extremely narrow, and all are dangerous both from the rapidity of the tides and from the generally discoloured state of the sea preventing the rocks being seen, even when close to them. A stranger should not attempt to navigate these channels without a competent pilot. The Vracheres, a rocky bank of small extent, is the outer or south-western danger off St. Aubin bay. The Frouquie, its highest head with only 5 feet water, is at the south-eastern extreme of the bank, with Prince's tower touching the western corner of Fort Regent E. by N. \\ N. ; and, the western martello tower in St. Brelade bay on with the western head of Rousse-Frouquie N.N.E.

The Petite Grune has 10 feet on its shoalest part, from which St. Mark's spire just shut in with Noirmont point bears E. by N. northerly ; and, the western martello tower in St. Brelade bay appears midway between Rousse rock and Le Fret point. The passage between the Petite Grune and Le Fret bank is 2tj cables wide. The Passage rock, of 14 feet, bears W. by N. \u00a7 N. 5 cables from the shoalest spot on the Petite Grune, and, from it, the Dog's Nest rock beacon is on with the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette ; this is also a leading mark for the western channel, but leads, as described, over the Passage rock and very close inside all these dangers. Their eastern boundary is marked by Tabor chapel on with the high-water extreme of Le Fret point. Grunes Vaudin are an extensive cluster of rocks more than a mile S.S.W. of Noirmont point and a mile eastward of the Vracheres. The two highest rocks, the Grand Vaudin and the S.W. rock, dry 5 feet near the middle of the bank, about N.E. and S.W. 2 cables from each other ; many other heads have only from one to 3 or 4 feet over them.

This last position should only be used in fine weather, but at the anchorage within the Diamond rock, vessels of 18 feet draught may ride out a heavy southerly gale in safety, being out of the strength of the tidal stream, and the swell and sea being broken by the outlying rocks, especially when the water is below the level of half tide. During neap tides, vessels of 22 feet draught may safely anchor inside the Diamond rock, but for deeper vessels there is no safe anchorage on any part of the southern coast of Jersey in very bad weather. PASSAGES into ST. AUBIN BAY.\u2014 Nine passages lead into St. Aubin bay, viz. : the North-west, Western, South-west Sillette, Danger rock, Middle, Hinguette, South, and Eastern In westerly gales, the best time to pass through any of these channels is between first quarter flood and high water. The first of the ebb or west-going stream throws up a very dangerous overfall off Noirmont point, and when that stream has fairly made, overfalls which continue with more or less intensity according to the height of the ocean swell and strength of the wind, extend across all the channels until the stream slacks. NORTH-WEST PASSAGE is only If cables wide at the narrowest part between Le Fret point and the rocky bank of that name, which, however, in the shallowest spot near it has 14 feet water ; the channel is safe and has nothing less than \\ fathoms in any part. Beingthe ordinary steam -packetroute between Southampton, Guernsey, and St. Helier, it is more used than any of the other channels.

WESTERN PASSAGE, between the Hubaut reefs and St. Brelade bank, is about 2f cables wide at its narrowest part, between the Petite Grune and Le Fret bank where there are from 7 to 9 fathoms water, but the Passage rock with only 14 feet lies in the fairway of the entrance. It is, however, the most direct route to St. Aubin bay and St. Helier harbour from the westward, one leading mark only being required, but as the marks are not easily made out in hazy weather, the North-west passage is probably the best and safest. Directions. \u2014 The leading mark is, the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette and the Dog's Nest beacon in line E. \\ S. ; this almost touches the northern side of the Passage rock, and passes only 100 yards northward of the Petite Grune, therefore in entering the channel from the westward, to clear those reefs, keep the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette open northward of the Dog's Nest beacon until Tabor chapel is on with Le Fret point, after which the white patch and beacon may be brought in line, and, as already described, they lead up to the entrance of the Little road. Should the white patch at Greve d'Azette be obscured, Noirmont tower on with De Pas tower E. \\ S. will do equally well, but, to clear the 20-feet rock eastward of Le Fret bank, the Hermitage rock should be opened clear of Noirmont point before shutting in Tabor chapel with Le Fret point ; and, if all objects eastward and near the town are invisible whilst the land about Noirmont and La Moye are tolerably clear, which is often the case in fine weather, Noirmont point may be approached to the distance of a cable ; but, in passing eastward of it, do not shut in La Moye white Semaphore house with Le Fret point until St. Aubin castle opens out ; this clears the dangerous rock between, and outside the line of, Noirmont tower and Pignonet beacon. After passing Pignonet beacon, bring Noirmont tower a little open northward of it, and when about 2^ cables eastward of the beacon, anchor until the weather clears. See charts, Nos. 62 b and c."], [281, "Chap. VI.] 253 ST. AUBIN BAY.\u2014 PASSAGES INTO. SOUTH-WEST PASSAGE is between the Vracheres and the Grunes Vaudin, eastward of the Grande Grune, and westward of the Grand Four. The narrowest part of the channel is between the 6-feet sunken rock at the northern part of the Grand Four, and another rock with 20 feet over it ; these rocks bear from each other W. by N. and E. by S. and are 2 cables apart. Directions. \u2014 Saumarez house, or the Firs, a yellow building about half way up the slope of the hill north-eastward of St. Matthew's church, on with Noirmont tower N.E. leads midway between the Frouquie of the Vrachere and the Grunes Vaudin ; enter the channel therefore on this line and run on it until the white patch in the sea wall at Greve d'Azette is on with the Dog's Nest beacon, when proceed as before directed. As the leading mark given leads very close past the western side of the Grand Four, it is recommended that on the flood vessels should run in on it only until Tabor chapel is on with the upper part of the slope of Le Fret bluff, and then use that as the leading mark until the eastern leading mark comes on. Tabor chapel is here given as the most conspicuous mark, but this leading line approaches the Grande Grune rather nearer than is desirable ; for the middle of the channel, Tabor chapel should be shut in altogether, and the Pic-nic hotel, a house with a white gable on the low land westward of the chapel, should be brought in line with the extreme of point Le Fret. As -there are overfalls and strong eddies from the rocks in this channel on both ebb and flood, it should be avoided except in tins weather. SILLETTE PASSAGE, between the Sillette rocks and the Grunes aux Dardes, is less than 2 cables wide, with an average depth of 6 fathoms ; but, a rocky patch of 26 feet lies in the fairway, so that no more than this depth can be depended on. Directions.\u2014 The Sillette passage should only be attempted by a sailing vessel with a fresh leading wind, as both tidal streams set right across it. The leading mark is, No. 3 white martello tower in St. Aubyn bay on with the eastern side of Grosse rock, on which there is a beacon, N. by E. \\ E.

MIDDLE PASSAGE. \u2014 In entering by this passage, Danger rock and the Grunes aux Dardes are left on the port hand, and the Tetards, Hinguette reef, and Grunes St. Michel on the starboard hand. The narrowest part would be b\\ cables wide but for two sunken rocks, with only 14 and 15 feet over them, southward of the Grunes St. Michel and distant from it nearly half a mile, thus dividing the channel into two. The westernmost of these two rocks has 15 feet water, and is near the middle of the channel at its entrance ; it bears from Danger rock E. by S. \u00a7 S. i-\\ cables. The best channel is between Danger rock and this 15-feet rock ; here the ground is clean and the soundings regular in about 7 fathoms. The eastern side of the Middle passage is rocky and the depths irregular. Directions. \u2014 Mont Plaisir house on with St. Aubin castle tower N. \\ W. leads through the Middle passage, passing 1^ cables west ward of the 15-feet rock, 2\\ cables eastward of Danger rock, and rather less from the Frouquie of the Grunes aux Dardes on which there are 5 feet water, 1| cables westward of the Rouaudiere buoy, \\\\ cables eastward of the Grunes du Port, and eastward of, but very close to the Junees sunken rocks. To clear the Diamond rock when anchoring in St. Aubin bay, haul to the eastward when the eastern end of Almorah terrace comes on with the Vrachere, which rock is marked by a beacon and is the innermost high rock northward of Elizabeth castle ; and anchor as convenient when Haule house opens eastward of St. Aubin castle tower. DANGER ROCK PASSAGE is between the Grunes aux Dardes and Danger rock and is at this part 3 cables wide with 5-j fathoms water near the middle, but two rocky patches of 16 and 17 feet lie close south-eastward of the leading line. This passage, like the Sillette, is dangerous at times for sailing vessels, and should not be taken without a pilot. Steam-vessels, however, whose captains are acquainted with the pilotage, use it as the most direct passage to the Little road from the south-westward. See chart, No. 62 b."], [283, "Chap. VI.] ST. AUBIN BAY.\u2014 PASSAGES INTO. 255 Directions. \u2014 Bring St. Mark's spire on with the south-eastern rock off the Hermitage N.E. \u00a7 E. ; this mark leads nearly 1^ cables southward of the southernmost rock of the Grunes aux Dardes, awash at low water, and rather farther from Danger rock ; it also passes more than 1| cables clear of the outer 7-feet rock of the Rouaudiere, and may be followed until the Dog's Nest beacon is on with the white patch on the sea wall in Greve d'Azette. HINGUETTE PASSAGE, between the Hinguette reef and the Tetards, is 3^ cables wide, has 7 or 8 fathoms water, and is a good and safe passage at slack water, but at other times requires careful allowance for the tide, which sets right across it. Directions. \u2014 Enter this passage with St. Mark's spire on with the Dog's Nest beacon N.E. by N. and run through between the Hin guette reef and the Tetards ; when St. Matthew's church comes on with the Gros du Chateau rock N. J W., the vessel is between the Cloches rocks at the entrance of the Little road. SOUTH PASSAGE is between the Tetards, with only 2 feet water, and some rocky patches to the eastward on which the shoalest spot has 14 feet. The channel is 2 cables wide, has 8 fathoms water, but is not so safe as the Hinguette or as the Eastern passage. Directions. \u2014 St. Matthew's church tower, a dull greyish- white building, seen between the heads of the Gros du Chateau rock N. -\\ W. leads through about mid-channel, and between the Cloches up to the entrance of the Little road ; but, if proceeding to the anchorage in St. Aubin bay, when St. Peter's spire is on with Lower Blanc Pignon house N. by W. \u00a7 W. steer with that as the leading mark up to the anchorage. Near low water, St. Peter's spire may be lost sight of before arriving at the anchorage, in which case care must be taken to note some other object in the line of direction. EASTERN PASSAGE.\u2014 The narrowest part of this passage is between a rock with 11 feet water and Demie de Pas, which dries 20 feet and on which is a beacon pole. The 11-feet rock bears W. by N. | N. 3 cables from Demie de Pas beacon, and, from it, the 9-feet rock, see page 249, bears N. by W. ]- W. one cable.

Directions.\u2014 Approaching from the eastward, run in with La Moye white Semaphore house open of Le Fret bluff until the Frouquie rock is abaft the beam ; then haul up to pass within a cable of Demie de Pas beacon, and when it bears S.E. by E. E. steer about N.W. by N. until St. Matthew church tower is between the heads of Gros du Chateau rock, the leading mark for the South passage ; this leads up to the entrance of the Little road ; or, St. Peter's spire on with Lower Blanc Pignon house, leads up to the anchorage in St. Aubin bay. ST. HELIER LITTLE ROAD.\u2014 DIRECTIONS.\u2014 From St. Aubin bay, or from the Westward.\u2014 When bound from St Aubin bay into the Little road, it is best to weigh at about half flood, at which time the depths at St. Helier are as stated at page 241. The channel is between the western Cloche rock with 8 feet water and the outer Oyster rock with 7 feet ; it is lj cables wide and has from 4^ to 5 fathoms water. Steer between the Oyster rock and the buoy marking the western Cloche rock, with the white patch on the sea wall at Greve d'Azette and the Dog's Nest beacon in line, until St. Mark's spire is on with the white patch at the Albert pier-head N.E., which mark leads into the Little road ; but, after passing the Platte rock, edge to the northward until St. Mark's spire is on with the northern white patch on the Albert pier, which, as already described, leads either to the anchorage in the Little road or up to the entrance of the harbour ; see also page 244. From the Southward. \u2014 Pass between the Cloches rocks with St. Mark's spire on with Victoria pier lighthouse N.E. or with the elbow and inner lights on Albert pier (green and red) in line ; and, when nearing the Oyster rocks, proceed by the marks just given for the Little road or for the harbour entrance, as may be required. From St. Aubin bay over the bridge to the Little road or St. Helier harbour. \u2014 This passage is only fit for small craft at high water ; in taking it, steer to pass half a cable northward of the Vrachere rock, or run in with St. Mark's spire on with the northern side of the hospital until De Pas tower opens northward of the northern white patch on the Albert pier, with which mark run over the Bridge (this part has only one foot water at half tide), and either enter the harbour or haul out into the Little road. See charts, Nos. 62 b and c,"], [285, "Chap. VI.] ST. HELIER LITTLE ROAD. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 257 By night. \u2014 Bring the Victoria pier white light to bear N.E., and steer for it until* the green light and inner red light on Albert pier are in line bearing N.E. \\ N. ; which mark, if visible so far, leads between the Hinguette rock and Grunes St. Michel up to the anchorage in the Little road, or to the entrance of the harbour, care being taken to observe the precautions named at page 245. If from the westward, see leading lights, page 242. CAUTION. \u2014 In entering the harbour, allowance must be made for the tide, which, at or near springs, runs in and out with consider able strength. The most dangerous time for a vessel to enter is at about half flood ; at that time, vessels are frequently forced over against the sank-bank fronting the South pier of the old harbour before they have time to turn their heads up the harbour. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 In beating along the southern coast of Jersey, it should always be borne in mind that the available space between the outer shoals off Noirmont point and the Minquiers ledge is but 8 miles, and between the Violet bank and the Minquiers only 6^ miles. Small vessels working up towards the narrows of the western channels, when eastward of the Kaines, may stand into St. Brelade bay until the Jument rock is on with La Moye point ; and southward, until the southern extreme of Elizabeth castle is on with Noirmont point. When in the narrows of the western channel, before half flood or after half ebb, backing and filling is recom mended with a beating wind ; with the east-going stream, the vessel's head should be off-shore, and with the west-going stream, in-shore. Between half flood and high water, a vessel may act according to her draught, for, at half tide, there are at least 13 feet over all the rocks in the offing of St. Aubin bay, with the exception of the Pignonet, Hinguette, and Sillette, on which there are then only 9, 8, and 7 feet respectively. If bound to the Little road or to St. Helier harbour, it may be useful to know that St. Mark's spire touching the southern side of Close rock leads 60 yards northward of the Rouaudiere ; and, the same spire on with the False Hermitage leads well southward of it. A vessel from the north-westward running for shelter in St. Aubin bay during a gale from that quarter, should keep \\\\ miles outside the Corbiere to avoid the breaking sea near it, especially between half ebb and low water ; and, when the land of Noirmont is well open, steer for its point until Grosnez point conies on with the See charts, Nos. 62 b and c."], [286, "258 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. [Chap. VI. Corbiere, when haul up for La Moye and bring the marks for the North-west passage on, see page 251, where much less sea will be found than in either of the other channels. In heavy westerly gales, the whole space between the outlying rocks off Noirmont point is a confused mass of breakers ; clouds of driving spray create an impenetrable mist, obscuring all marks near the level of the sea, and the beacons marking rocks are all out of sight ; but, even under such circumstances, the North-west passage may be safely taken by those acquainted with it as both Le Fret and Noirmont points are safe of approach for large vessels to the distance of one cable. On arriving abreast of Noirmont point, attend to the directions given at page 252 ; or, do not shut in La Moye white Semaphore house with Le Fret point until No. 3 white martello tower in St. Aubin bay opens eastward of St. Aubin castle, to clear the Pignonet rocks, as the first of the flood sets right over these rocks into St. Aubin bay. It may be useful to repeat that when Haule house comes on with the western end of the wall extending westward from St. Aubin castle the vessel is midway between the Grunes du Port and the Diamond rock ; and, that St. Saviour's church tower just open northward of St. Mark's spire and on with the high rock between Gros du Chateau and the Vrachere rock beacon E. by N. \\ N. leads up to the anchorage in St. Aubin bay, well clear of the Diamond rock. Approaching from the westward, the Frouquie rock, off Le Croc point, on with Seymour tower E. \u00a7 S. leads outside all the shoals off Noirmont point and St. Aubin bay until near the Tetards, when the tower should be brought nearly on with the Rousse rock, just northward of the Icho tower. From the eastward, La Moye white Semaphore house open of Le Fret bluff N.W. \\ W. leads outside all the rocks off St. Clement's bay, and of the Frouquie and Demie de Fas, up to the entrance of the Eastern passage. The COAST eastward of St. Helier is low and sandy to La Roque point, the south-eastern extreme of Jersey, distant 5^ miles E. by S. \\ S. from Noirmont point ; and also northward of La Roque point as far as Mont Orgueil bluff, which bears from La Roque point N.N.E. \\ E. 2 miles, the bight between them being named Grouville bay, off which, at one mile S.E. \\ E. from Mont Orgueil castle, is good anchorage for vessels of the largest size. The southern part of See charts, Nos. 62 a and b."], [287, "Chap. VI.] COAST.\u2014 VIOLET BANK.\u2014 TIDAL STREAM. 259 this coast is inaccessible to shipping, it being fringed by extensive reefs which dry in some parts around La Roque point 2 miles from the shore at low water, springs. The outer edge of these reefs on the southern side is generally steep to and, fortunately, well marked by a number of large rocks, which, although sometimes nearly awash at high water, are never entirely covered, and also by two stone towers, viz., the Icho tower, about 3 miles south-eastward of the Little road of St. Helier ; and, Seymour tower, off La Roque point, If miles farther eastward and near the middle of the Violet bank. VIOLET BANK is the general name applied to the south-eastern part of the great reefs eastward of St. Helier. The part which dries at low water, springs, extends\" rather more than 2 miles from La Roque point, and consists of gravel, shingle, and sand, interspersed with numerous ledges of sharp-pointed rocks ; beyond this to the eastward, the bank extends 1^ miles beyond the Conchiere rock with many sunken reefs, included in the description of the Violet channel. The greater part of the bank covers at half flood, at which time there is a foot of water over the inner part of the ridge of sand and shingle extending from La Roque point to Seymour tower ; this, the lowest part of the ridge, is near La Roque point and is the most favourable spot for the passage of boats. At high water, the drying part of the bank is entirely covered and is then only marked by the Conchiere rock at its southern extreme, by Seymour tower near the middle, by Karame rock, at this time awash, on the South-east, and by Little Seymour rock, also awash but marked by a pole and basket beacon, near its eastern side. Tidal Stream. \u2014 From half flood to half ebb, the stream runs with a velocity of 6 knots, at springs, over the Violet bank and through the Violet channel in a north-easterly direction, turning northward through GoreyT roads where its strength is about 4| knots. As before remarked, the reef eastward of St. Helier, as well as the southern edge of the Violet bank, is well marked by conspicuous rocks, which, together with the principal sunken dangers along this line, will now be described.

Dangerous rocks, which never show, extend If cables westward of it ; and 2\\ cables north-westward is a rocky group, of which the Trois Grunes, the highest heads, uncover 20 feet. A chain of rather high rocks extends from the White rock to the shore.

The Frouquie, S.E. \\ S. 1\\ cables from White rock, is 3 feet lower than that rock, and therefore nearly awash at high water, springs. A dangerous reef extends W.S.W. 2\\ cables from the Frouquie, and a chain of high rocks connects it with point Le Croc, of which the inner and highest is Motto islet, about 22 feet above the level of the highest tides ; La Sambue, another rock in the same chain being only 2 feet lower. This line of rocks marks the limit of the Greve d'Azette, the first bay eastward of St. Helier. La Moye white Semaphore house open of Le Fret point N.W. \\ W. leads 2 cables south-westward of the Demie de Pas and of the rocks extending from the Frouquie. The coast between Motto islet and La Roque point recedes slightly and forms St. Clement's bay. Between the Frouquie and Icho tower, no rocks are visible at high water to mark the outer edge of the reef fronting this bay, but, at half tide and less, it is well marked by the Rouget rock, which is close to the edge of deep water and bears S.E. easterly 6^ cables from the Frouquie ; also, by the Jinquet which dries 25 feet 5 cables E. by S. \u00a7 S. from the Rouget ; and, 3 cables eastward of the Jinquet rock is the Grande Frouquie, which bears W. by S. | S. 3 cables from the Icho tower and is 7 or 8 feet above the level of the highest tides. ICHO and SEYMOUR TOWERS are built of stone, are each about 45 feet above the level of high water, bear from each other E. \\ N. and W. \\ S. and are 1| miles apart. Icho tower is surrounded by high rocks, and in this respect differs from Seymour tower, which at high water rises abruptly from the sea and is completely isolated. See charts, Nos. 62 a and b."], [289, "Chap. VI.] ICHO AND SEYMOUR TOWERS.\u2014 VIOLET CHANNEL. 261 Echiquelez rock is one of the principal sea-marks near Icho tower, from which it bears S. by E. \\ E. 4| cables. Its summit is 5 feet above the highest tides ; it is steep-to on the outside westward, but S.S.E. \\ E. 1| cables from it is a half -tide rock ; and, north westward, in line between it and the Jinquet, are several dangerous rocks, of which the farthest dries 5 feet and lies 1\\ cables S.S.W. from the Grande Frouquie. Between Echiquelez rock and the Conchiere, the edge of the reef curves outwards 2\\ cables beyond a straight line connecting those rocks. Icho bank is a dangerous, rocky, irregular, off-lying ridge about 4| cables long N.N.W. and S.S.E., and H cables wide ; the least water, 2\\ fathoms, is at the northern extreme, and bears S.W. \u00a3 W. 2j miles from the Icho tower. From this shoal spot, Platte Roque martello tower just open northward of Icho tower bears N.E. E. ; and, St. Peter's spire open eastward of Lower Blanc Pignon house N. by W. \u00a7 W. On other parts of the bank there are from 3 to 5 fathoms water. The channel between this bank and the rocks fronting Icho tower is nearly 2 miles wide and clear of danger. The Conchiere rock, 2 miles from La Roque point and at the southern extreme of the Violet bank, dries 41 feet and is therefore never covered, although sometimes awash. From it, Mont Orgueil castle and Seymour tower are exactly in line N. \\ E., the latter distant ~L\\ miles. A reef extends 1^ cables southward from the Conchiere ; therefore that rock should not be approached nearer than 3 cables. A good clearing mark for the line of reef just described between the Frouquie and Conchiere rocks is, Corbiere lighthouse touching La Moye point until the Grande Anquette beacon turret is well open southward of the Conchiere rock. VIOLET CHANNEL.\u2014 The sunken part of the Violet bank commencing at the Conchiere rock, extends eastward 1^ miles with dangerous reefs on its edge in the direction of the Echiquelez and Conchiere rocks in line. Northward of these reefs for rather more than a mile, the entire space is shoal water with rocks innumerable ; so that, at low water, it is difficult for a stranger to find his way through them even in a boat. The southern edge of the bank is See charts, Nos. 62 a and b."], [290, "262 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. well marked at the last quarter ebb by a long string of rocks called the Route en Ville ; its eastern extreme is bounded by the Petit Four, a rock with 2 feet water ; and, the bank may be said to extend northward as far as the Cochon, Noire, and Grande Haisse rocks. The navigable part of the Violet channel is between this sunken part of the Violet bank and the Plateau de la Frouquie, the rocky bank to the southward, on the northern edge of which are the Goubiniere, Rousse Platte, and other dangerous rocks ; and the Anquette rocks to the eastward. The narrowest part is between the Petit Four and the sunken rocks westward and north-westward of the Petite Anquette, where it is about 5 cables wide, but it is only a cable wider between the Plateau de la Frouquie and the Route en Ville rocks ; the general depth is from 5 to 6 fathoms. Anquette Channel leads out eastward between the Grande and Petite Anquette rocks from the middle of the Violet channel. The general depth of water is about the same as in the Violet channel, but, from the absence of good leading marks, the passage is more difficult. Near the point of separation of the Anquette and Violet channels, with Prince's tower and Little Seymour beacon in line, and with the Grand Anquette beacon turret bearing East, southerly, is a rock with 23 feet water and another near it with 25 feet. Though nothing less than these depths has been found, caution is necessary with large ships passing through this part of the channel at low water. Vessels of 15 feet draught or upwards should wait until the flood tide has fairly made, and, with any swell on, should not pass through until the first quarter flood. DANGERS in the VIOLET CHANNEL\u2014 The Conchiere rock, see preceding page, is the principal mark at the western entrance of the Violet channel. Taxe rock, 6-} cables eastward of the Conchiere, dries 10 feet at low water ; from it, the Conchiere and Echiquelez rocks are exactly in line bearing N.W. by W. f W.

St. Martin's spire on with Gorey tower leads over a 2-feet rock half a cable within or westward of their eastern end. To clear these rocks on their southern side, keep Icho tower open southward of the Conchiere rock until Prince's tower is on with Seymour tower ; after which, keep Echiquelez rock open southward of the Conchiere until Prince's tower is on with No. 5 martello tower in Grouville bay.

From the rock, La Moye white Semaphore house is over the outer part of Le Fret point. There are several rocks northward of the Goubiniere ; the Canger rock is the most northern, it dries 16 feet, and is one cable distant from the Goubiniere. Orgueil castle open westward of Seymour tower and of the Con chiere rock clears the Goubiniere and all dangers on the western side of the Plateau de la Frouquie. Frouquier Aubert rock is at the south-western edge of the Plateau de la Frouquie, 1J miles south-eastward of the Goubiniere ; it uncovers 26 feet at low water and does not cover at neaps.

Rousse Platte rock is at the eastern side of the Plateau de la Frouquie, and E. h S. rather more than a mile from the Goubiniere ; it is a large flat rock about 100 yards in diameter and dries 14 feet. Between this rock and the Goubiniere are several rocks, of which one dries 15 feet, another dries only 4 feet but is the most dangerous, as it stands prominently out in the channel, which, between it and the Route en Ville reefs, is only 6 cables wide.

GROUVILLE BAY, which derives its name from a hamlet near St. Clement's church, is on the eastern side of Jersey between La Roque point and Mont Orgueil. Its outer southern boundary commences on the north-eastern side of the Violet bank and is very rocky ; numerous masses of rock lie scattered along the low-water line to the northward, which line is nearly a mile from the shore in the southern part of the bay ; there are also many rocks within as well as outside this line. Grouville bay, at low water, is very picturesque with its vast expanse of fine white sand rising with a gentle slope towards the shore, bounded on the South by Seymour tower and the rugged rocks of the Violet bank, and on the North by Mont Orgueil and its venerable castle.

Little Seymour rock.\u2014 Beacon.\u2014 Amongst other rocks on the southern side of the bay is Little Seymour rock, awash at high water and marked by a pole-and-basket beacon, from which a long string of rocks extends eastward, forming the low-water boundary of the bay. The most important of these rocks are : the Cochon at the outer edge, which dries 7 feet ; the Grande Haisse, which dries 22 feet ; and the Noire, which dries 14 feet, at 9| cables S. by E. from the Horn rock, and nearly a mile outside Little Seymour beacon. The Giffard, a most dangerous mid-channel rock in approaching Grouville bay from the southward, lies about 4 cables north-eastward of the Noire, and has only one foot over it at low water.

GOREY TOWN AND HARBOUR, at the northern end of Grouville bay, are immediately under Mont Orgueil castle. The little town contains about 1,000 inhabitants ; it is considered to be See chart, No. 62 a."], [297, "Chap. VI.] 269 GOREY, TOWN AND HARBOUR. particularly salubrious, and has railway communication with St. Helier, and by steamer with the coast of Normandy. It has a fair trade in vegetables, fruit, coal, cattle, timber, &c. Supplies of all kinds can be obtained, including coal in limited quantities, but vessels requiring coal, unless it can be shipped during tide time, 4 or 5 hours, have to lie aground in their berths. Hospital accommodation is avail able in case of sickness or accident. Depths. \u2014 The harbour is formed by a stone pier built out from the south-western part of Orgueil head. The outer berth alongside the pier has a depth of only 9 feet at half tide, about 23 feet at high water, springs, and 14 or 15 feet at neaps ; at low water, springs, the sand dries one cable outside the pier-head. Two small warping buoys are moored at the entrance to assist vessels arriving or leaving, the outer buoy about a cable south-west ward of the pier-head, the other about 80 yards westward of the pier. About 135 yards westward from the pier-head is a space paved with flat stones for depositing oysters ; it is, however, much broken up and no longer used for that purpose. With this exception, the bottom of Gorey harbour, consisting of mud and sand, affords good grounding berths. Vessels of 300 tons may occasionally be seen here, and about 300 vessels of all sizes enter the port annually, though the bottom dries at low water from 10 to 15 feet ; as it is the headquarters of the oyster fishery, a number of sloops of from 30 to 50 tons belong to the place- Sharp vessels not provided with legs should always get a pier berth and list inwards, assisted by mast-head tackles to the shore, to prevent falling over at low water. During severe gales, a vessel strains less in taking the ground, is better sheltered, and experiences less 'scend in this harbour than in any other in the Channel islands. Mooring buoy. \u2014 A Government mooring buoy is placed in 11 feet, with Gorey slip just open of the pier-head, and Horn rock and Ecureuil beacons in line, distant only one cable from the latter. The ground chain of these moorings lies North and South ; there are 38 fathoms on each arm, and the anchors are of 24 and 30 cwt. A cable within the buoy there are 7 feet, and 3J fathoms at the same distance outside, but close to their north-eastern side is a rock with only 7 feet at the lowest tides.

On the slope of the hill, from a red lantern in the face of the wall below Gorey church tower, at 535 yards N.W. from the pier-head lighthouse, and 80 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed red light, visible 8 miles. The two lights in line N.W. lead northward of the Frouquies de Greve, and of the Road, Fisherman, and Azicot rocks, and southward of the Ecureuil rock, in passing which latter, the red light should on no account be opened northward of the ivhite light. Storm Signals. \u2014 There is a storm signal station at Gorey. DANGERS. \u2014 Beacons. \u2014 The principal dangers in the immediate neighbourhood of the port of Gorey are the following : \u2014 The Equerriere is the largest and most conspicuous rock off Gorey harbour; it bears E. by S. \\ S. 4J cables from the pier-head, dries 35 feet, and is marked by a pole and fish-tail beacon. Another rock, drying 14 feet, lies about 135 yards S.E. \\ S. from it. Dasher rock, with 2 feet water and from 18 to 20 feet close-to, lies S. by W. about one cable from the Equerriere rock. The Ecureuil, \\\\ cables S.W. of the Equerriere, dries 14 feet, and is marked by a pole-and-basket beacon. Fisherman rock, with 8 feet water, lies S. \\ W. 2^ cables from the Dasher rock. Other rocks which abound here, though smaller, are very dangerous, such as the Azicot rock, 2 cables outside Gorey pier-head, which dries 5 feet and is marked by a spar buoy ; the Guillimots, a group of rocks S. by W. 2\\ cables from the Azicot, of which group the outer rock dries 6 feet and is marked by a spar buoy ; the Burons, a rocky group 2 cables south-eastward from the Guillimots, of which the highest rock lies to the N.E. and is also marked by a spar buoy ; and the Grune du Port, with 5 feet water 3^ cables outside the Burons, on a line connecting Gorey pier-head and Horn rock beacon, but 3| cables inside the latter. The Tres Grunes lie 2 cables outside and eastward of the Equerriere rock, and are awash at low water. Little Seymour beacon on with Seymour tower S. by W. \u00a3 W. leads 150 yards eastward, but passes over a 25-feet rock just outside them, which See chart, No. 62 a."], [299, "Chap. VI.] GOREY.\u2014 DIRECTIONS.\u2014 BANC DU CHATEAU. 271 rock is the extreme end of the ledge, the water being deep close up to it. To clear this outer rock when passing the Tres Grunes in a large vessel, Little Seymour beacon should be kept perceptibly open west ward of Seymour tower. Northward about 1\u00a3 cables from the Tres Grunes is the Pacquet rock with 2 feet water ; within and north-westward of which, at about the same distance, are the Arches rocks, a small group which dry 14 and 15 feet, the south-eastern rock being marked by a spar buoy. Northward of these again, and within 3 or 4 cables of Mont Orgueil, are the Grand Houmet, Le Mont, Seven Grunes to be pre sently described, and many other rocks, the ground here being very foul. Directions. \u2014 To enter the Inner road or Gorey harbour, three channels are available according to state of tide. For the southern channel, the leading mark by day is the red lantern of the high light on with the pier-head N.W., and by night, the two lights in line. For the middle channel, the northern end of the white house at the top of Hard way on with the pier-head N.W. by W. f W. leads between the Equerriere and Ecureuil rocks up to the Government mooring buoy in the Inner road. For the northern channel, the leading mark is the chimneys of Fort William on with the pier-head W. \\ S. southerly ; as this leads close past the Arches rocks, it will be well to open the chimneys a little southward of the pier-head before the Equerriere and Ecureuil beacons are in line. If entering the harbour, having approached it by either of these channels, run up to the entrance, passing on either side of the Azicot spar buoy, but leaving both the warping buoys near the pier-head on the port hand in rounding it, and be careful not to approach the pier too closely, as the tide sets round it to the eastward with great strength after half flood, at springs. When the Horn rock is awash, there are 10 feet water just off the end of Gorey pier and 5 feet at the outer berth alongside it. BANC du CHATEAU. \u2014 This extensive bank of sand, gravel, and shells, lies off Grouville bay nearly parallel with the low water line of the shore and distant from it rather more than a mile, except at its northern end which approaches Mont Orgueil within 1\\ cables ; it forms a great natural protection to the anchorage in Gorey roads. Set chart, No. 62 a."], [300, "272 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. Within the 5-fathoms line, the bank is rather more than 2 miles long by 4 cables wide ; the main body has a general depth of 2\\ to 3 fathoms, gravel bottom ; from this base rise numerous narrow sandy ridges extending across the bank in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction. Near the middle, for about a mile, these ridges are so close together as to form almost one continuous bank, and have accordingly been named the Middle bank. At very low tides, parts of these ridges occasionally dry. The North ridge is nearly 4 cables within the northern end of the Bane du Chateau, and has from 10 to 12 feet water ; just south ward of it is a smaller ridge with as little as 4 feet. The South ridge, with from 12 to 16 feet water, forms the south-western and southern edge of the bank close to deep water. The Bane du Chateau is much affected by the weather and by the action of the tidal streams ; the upper part, within a limited space, is continually shifting, and during westerly winds the ridges of the sand-banks are so sharp that, when awash, a boat may easily knock them down in passing over. At such times the banks are about 4 feet higher than with westerly winds. Clearing marks. \u2014 Grouville mill, which stands on the high land south-westward of Grouville church but has no sweeps, on with the southern side of Mont Orgueil bluff W.S.W., clears the 5-fathoms line at the northern end of the bank. Icho tower and Little Seymour beacon in line W. by S. \\ S. lead close past its southern end. Coupe turret on with the breakwater house under Verclut bluff N. by W. clears the north-western corner and leads down its western side nearly in mid-channel ; and, Coupe turret on with St. Catherine's breakwater lighthouse N.N.W. 4 W. leads east ward of the bank as well as of a rocky 5-fathoms patch outside, but westward of the West Tongue sands. Tongue sands are two small shoal banks nearly 1 and 2 miles respectively eastward of the South ridge of the Bane du Chateau, but separated from it and from each other by good clear channels. They are of the same character as the Bane du Chateau, having sharp ridges of fine sand. The least water on the eastern bank is 36 feet, and on the western bank 23 feet.

Anchorage. \u2014 Between the western side of the Bane du Chateau and the 5-fathoms line fronting Grouville bay is the Outer road, a safe anchorage and large enough to accommodate several vessels of deep draught, it being a mile long North and South by 4| cables wide. The eastern limit is marked by Coupe turret being on with the breakwater house at Verclut bluff, and its western limit by St. Catherine and Archirondel towers in line. At its northern extreme, Gorey pier-head is open southward of the Equerriere beacon ; and, at its southern end, No. 4 martello tower and the Horn rock beacon are in line W. \\ N. The space included within these lines has a depth of from 6 to 8 fathoms with an even bottom of gravel and shells, and the best line on which to anchor is with Grouville spire on with Fort Henry. The Inner road is within the 5-fathoms line of Grouville bay, between the Road and Inner road rocks, and between the Equerriere beacon and the Burons rocks. In-shore of this space is the Government mooring buoy, as already described. The best line on which to anchor in the Inner road is, with Prince's tower open northward of Fort William the apparent breadth of the latter. The anchorage in Gorey roads is the only place in the Channel islands, or on the French coast from St. Malo to Cherbourg, where a squadron of heavy ships might find good shelter in a westerly or north-westerly gale ; and, with proper charts and sailing directions, the approach is sufficiently easy for any seaman, in clear weather, to take his ship in without the aid of a pilot. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Grouville bay.\u2014 The approach to Grouville bay from the direction of the Violet channel has been already given, see page 266. When running for this bay from the northward, and having cleared the Pierres de Lecq, the Drouilles, and other dangers near the northern end of Jersey by the directions hereafter given, see pages 288-289 ; avoid the foul ground off Nez du Guet and Coupe point by giving each a berth of at least 3 cables in rounding them.

The North channel into Gorey road is between Fara ledge and the northern end of the Bane du Chateau, and is there only 2\\ cables wide between the 5-fathom lines, with a depth of 6 fathoms in mid-channel, but it has a depth of 4 fathoms for a width of 4 cables and is therefore perfectly safe for large ships. Entering this channel from the northward, keep Belle Hougue bluff open of Tour de Rozel point until Little Seymour beacon is just open westward of Seymour tower, which mark leads inside the Bane du Chateau up to the anchorage. At any time after the first quarter flood, the deepest ships may enter the North channel either with the mark just given or with No. 1 martello tower at La Roque point on with the Equerriere beacon, passing over the Fara ledge ; the former has the great advantage for long ships of making much less abrupt the turn to the leading mark through the Outer road, Coupe mound open of Verclut bluff. To anchor as near the shore as possible, Coupe turret may be shut in a little over Verclut point ; but, Little Seymour beacon should be kept perceptibly open westward of Seymour tower until Fort William is open southward of the Equerriere beacon in order to clear the Tres Grunes, or until the best anchoring lines, already given, are approached, when anchor as convenient. The South Channel is between the shore reefs on the western side, and the southern end of the Bane du Chateau and reefs north ward of the Anquettes on the eastern side, and, as the narrows are reached, between the Giffard rock and the South ridge of the Bane du Chateau, where it is only 3^ cables wide. The water is deep throughout, there being not less than 8 fathoms in mid-channel at the lowest tides. Approaching this channel from the northward, to clear a rocky bank of 32 feet outside the Bane du Chateau, keep Coupe turret outside St. Catherine's lighthouse until Prince's tower comes on with Gorey pier-head, after which the turret may be brought inside the lighthouse as far as the outer arches of the breakwater ; and, when See chart, No. 62 a."], [303, "Chap.

It is, however, generally difficult and often impossible to distin guish the marks for this channel owing to their distance ; a vessel of deep draught should therefore only attempt it in charge of an experienced pilot and during the upper half of the tide ; nor should square-rigged vessels ever attempt to work through except under such conditions.

From this position, haul to the southward to bring Coupe mound open of Verclut point and use it for the leading mark ; or, if the Rousse Platte rock is uncovered, steer direct for it on a S.W. bearing until Grande Anquette beacon turret bears E. \\ N. In either case, steer westward with the Anquette beacon turret on that bearing until Icho tower is on with the Conchiere rock, when the vessel is clear of the Route en Ville reefs and may steer to pass 3 or 4 cables southward of the Conchiere rock. ANNE PORT BAY, between Grouville and St. Catherine bays, is small, and outlying rocks render the approach to it dangerous ; there is, however, good anchorage off it, occasionally used by fishing boats and other small craft in fine weather. The principal dangers are, on the southern side, the Seven Grunes, and, on the northern side, the Cloches rocks. Between these reefs is the anchorage ; it is 2\\ cables in extent North and South, has an even depth of \\\\ or 5 fathoms, and is sheltered from the tide. The Seven Grunes, form a long straggling reef extending 2>\\ cables eastward from the Grosse Moie ; the highest rock, near the middle of the reef, uncovers 7 feet, and the outer Grune, called Le Mont, has 5 feet water over it. The Cloches rocks extend in an E. by S. direction 5^ cables from Crete point to a rock with only one foot water ; they are the southern rocks of the Fara or St. Catherine's bank and several heads in-shore of the one-foot rock dry from one to 5 feet. ST. CATHERINE'S BAY, on the eastern shore of Jersey northward of Mont Orgueil castle, though much encumbered by rocks, affords excellent anchorage for small craft in 2 or 3 fathoms water, with a bottom of muddy sand covered with very long grass and seaweed ; it is difficult, however, for a sailing vessel to enter or leave except with a leading wind. The bay is completely sheltered from northerly, westerly, and south-westerly winds ; but, south easterly and easterly winds blow right in and, near high water, cause a short turbulent chopping sea ; as the tide falls, however, the sea subsides.

The northern pier or breakwater was completed in 1855, and extends 826 yards S.E. from Verclut point, the northern extreme of the bay, and over the rocky bed formerly called the Pierre Mouillee ; it has a depth of 5 fathoms at its outer end at low water, and on the pier-head stands the lighthouse. The pier has a lofty parapet, and, alongside it, a steam-vessel of large size might coal, water, and land or embark troops, with any wind from N.N.E. round by West to S.W. The southern breakwater was designed to extend in an easterly direction from the point near Archirondel tower across the Fara reef. Of this, however, only about 200 yards has been built, and the work discontinued. Should the southern pier ever be completed and a harbour formed it might prove useful in bringing Jersey into closer commercial relations with France ; but, from the great strength of the tides across the entrance of the bay, and from the dangerous rocks near, it is now difficult of access to sailing vessels in bad weather, and only fit for ordinary use by steam-vessels. LIGHT. \u2014 A white octagonal iron lighthouse, 30 feet high from base to vane, stands on the outer extreme of the parapet wall of Verclut breakwater. It exhibits a. fixed white light of the fifth order at 60 feet above the level of high water, visible in clear weather from 10 to 12 miles. DANGERS off and in ST. CATHERINE'S BAY \u2014The approach to St. Catherine's bay from the South-east is completely barred by St. Catherine or Fara bank, a large bed of rocks about half a mile square, of which the outer part extends 8 cables eastward of Archirondel tower. The rocks begin to uncover about the last quarter ebb, many show at low water but by far the greater number never dry. Beacon. \u2014 On the southern edge of the bank are the Cloches, already described ; on the eastern side, the Fara rock, about 100 yards wide, which dries 9 feet and, with a pole beacon in its centre, is the most conspicuous rock ; also, on the eastern side, the Grune du Nord which dries one foot ; and within, on the North-west and North, the Basses de Fara, and the Etot rock which dries 10 feet.

Within St. Catherine's bay, in line between the lighthouse and Archirondel tower and nearly 2 cables from the lighthouse, is a rock with only 8 feet water ; Le Graveur, another rock with only 7 feet, lies northward of a line drawn from the lighthouse to St. Catherine's martello tower, with Coupe turret just showing over Verclut point. Caution. \u2014 During spring +ides, the stream sets with great velocity over St. Catherine's bank into the bay and also round the end of the breakwater, for which due allowance must be made in entering or leaving the bay. Anchorage. \u2014 There is barely room for one large ship to anchor in St. Catherine's bay. The best berth is in 5 fathoms water about a cable distant from the breakwater and 1^ cables westward from the lighthouse.

With Coupe turret on with St. Catherine's lighthouse, a vessel is clear of all the rocks of St. Catherine's bank, and may steer for the lighthouse, hauling into the bay, when a cable distant from it, with St. Martin's spire nearly shut in over the bluff northward of St. Catherine's martello tower for a leading mark, and anchoring as convenient by the marks just given. There is another passage into this bay from the southward between the Cloches and Crete point which, though much encumbered by rocks nearly awash at low water, may be useful occasionally to small craft with pilots. A very useful mark for this small channel during the lower part of the tide is, St. Catherine's martello tower on with the eastern side of Little Fara rock to clear Le Mont, the outer rock of the Seven Grunes ; and, having passed that danger, open the tower a little inside the Little Fara before passing Crete point, to clear the rocks along the inner part of St. Catherine's bank. A vessel may pass close inside the Little Fara in 9 feet at low water, ordinary springs. Coupe point is a bluff about 180 feet high, and so named from its being connected with the neighbouring land by a narrow neck of little more than half that height. On the summit of the bluff is a ruined guard-house surmounted by a stone sentry box or turret, a conspicious and very useful mark, known as Coupe turret, to which frequent reference is made. An extensive range of farm buildings stands near the edge of the plateau southward of and overlooking the Coupe ; two high rocks lie half a cable outside the bluff, from which a dangerous reef extends 2 cables eastward.

As Gorey road affords indifferent shelter with southerly winds, vessels bound to Gorey harbour, during strong winds from that quarter and not able to save their tide in, may anchor under shelter of the breakwater until two hours flood, when they will still have sufficient southerly tide to enable them to reach the road by the time there is water enough to enter the harbour. No vessel, however, should anchor in this bay with the intention of remaining longer than a tide, for a shift of wind to S.E. or N.E. would place her in a dangerous position.

Telegraph cable. \u2014 The telegraph cable between Jersey and France is laid in a S.E. by E. E. direction from Fliquet bay to Pirou on the French coast, see page 194. The shore end in Jersey is at the white martello tower in Fliquet bayr, on which is painted in black letters the word Telegraph, surmounted by a green disc. To prevent damage to the cable, or loss of anchors, grapnels, or dredges, by the fishermen, the following directions are given : \u2014 The course of the cable is distinctly indicated by the two towers, which are a sufficient guide during the day for clearing it. Fishing-boats without a compass may avoid it on the South by not opening the Tour de Rozel northward of Coupe point ; and, on the North, by not shutting in the guard-house in Bouley bay with the Tour de Rozel. Anchorage. \u2014 From the northward, Seymour house, on the hill northward of Gorey, on with or a little eastward of the breakwater house under Verclut point S.S.W. leads between the Brayes and Coupe rock ; and, from the eastward, Rozel mill or with Fliquet telegraph tower, W. by N.

Care is required in taking up this anchorage, as it is only a cable northward of the telegraph cable. With westerly winds, anchor nearer Coupe point in about the centre of the bay. ROZEL BAY.\u2014 N.W. nearly one mile from Coupe point is Nez du Guet, and between them is Rozel bay, which, being exposed to all winds from S. by E. round by East to N.W. by N., is only used as an anchorage to await sufficient water to enter the harbour. In addition to the foul ground off the points of the bay, there is a rocky group called the Hiaux, which uncovers 3 feet, one cable from the western shore and 1\u00a3 cables from the pier-head, with the Royal hotel on with the white patch on the pier-head ; and, also a sunken rock with 5 feet water on the eastern side of the entrance to the harbour, one cable from the shore. Rozel harbour. \u2014 This small but useful harbour in the western part of Rozel bay is dry throughout at low water ; it has a stone pier capable of affording shelter to 20 small cutters, such as are employed in the oyster fishery. A great quantity of cider is shipped here during the summer months, and the harbour affords berthing places to six vessels of from 40 to 50 tons. North-westerly winds cause a great range, so that vessels frequently carry away the large hawsers used in mooring alongside the pier. Gorey harbour is preferable to Rozel in every respect. The mouth of the harbour is much obstructed by a large, flat, half tide rock, on the southern side of the entrance, between which and the pier-head there is only room for two small vessels to enter abreast ; with a foul wind, vessels are obliged to kedge in or out. Directions. \u2014 Entering Rozel harbour from the northward, keep St. Catherine's lighthouse in sight outside Coupe point until the Royal hotel at Rozel is southward of the white patch on the pier head W. by S. J S., which mark leads southward of the Hiaux, and to the entrance of the harbour. Give the pier-head a close shave, to avoid the half-tide rock just described.

Tour de Rozel forms a most useful mark ; it is a conical mass of rock 155 feet high, detached from the point within it, and about 4 cables westward of Rozel bay. A half -tide rock, the Demie de la Tour, lies 150 yards outside it ; with this exception the approach to it is quite safe. Rozel mill, also a most useful mark repeatedly referred to in this work, stands on high land half a mile south-westward from the shore of the bay, and is 335 feet above the level of the sea. It has no sweeps, but has a white dome roof, and the body of the mill is of a reddish colour. About 35 yards north-eastward of it is the Mill house, a white building with a black roof, which obscures the mill from view when bearing between S. by W. and S.W. BOULEY BAY, on the northern side of Jersey, between Tour de Rozel and Belle Hougue point, affords good shelter with the wind from W. by N. round by South to S.S.E. The only dangers in and near this bay are, the Oyster rocks, the Troupeurs, the Sambues, and the Grune de Vicard, a small rock near the western shore. Oyster rocks are 2| cables in-shore of the Troupeurs, extend 1^ cables N.N.E. from Meulet point, and dry 13 feet at low water. Troupeurs rocks, near the middle of the bay, are the two highest heads of a small rocky bank, about 70 yards apart, which bear from each other about N.E. and S.W. ; the outer head has 10 feet water, the inner head 7 feet. From the outer head, the inner high rock of the Pierres de Lecq is a little open of Belle Hougue point ; and, the western side of Meulet point on with the western side of the high cliff immediately above it bears S. by W. westerly.

Anchorage.\u2014 To anchor outside the Troupeurs in from 8 to 10 fathoms, gravel bottom, keep the whole of the Pierres de Lecq at least a point open of Belle Hougue point, or Coupe turret open of Tour de Rozel point ; and, the white tower of Castle house, on the high land overlooking the bay, on with Bouley pier S.W. S. Or closer in, with the white tower of the Castle house open of the pier S.W. by W. ; and, Belle Hougue point, seen over the land, a little northward of Vicard point N.W. in 5 fathoms, fine sand. This is a safe anchorage with southerly winds, but open to those from the northward. Directions. \u2014 To enter Bouley bay from the eastward, steer in with the slate-roofed house, on the western side of the bay above the pier, on with the pier-head West ; this leads between the Demie de la Tour, on which the tide sets strongly, and the Troupeurs rocks up to the anchorage in 44/ fathoms. Vessels anchored in this bay during south-westerly gales should be prepared to weigh directly the wind begins to veer to N.W., and run either to St. Catherine's bay or Gorey road. BELLE HOUGUE POINT, about a mile westward of the anchorage in Bouley bay, is the highest and, except Grosnez, the most remarkable headland on the northern coast of Jersey. From it, a reef of sunken rocks extends 2 cables off-shore ; this reef is cleared on its north-eastern side by keeping Coupe turret open of Tour de Rozel, and, on its northern side, by keeping Plemont point in sight outside Ronez point.

The main group of the Ecrehos rocks occupy a space near the centre of the reef 1} miles in extent North and South and 8 cables wide, the whole of which space dries before low water. Maitre ile, whose summit rises about 30 feet above the level of high water, is the largest of the group, and is at the south-eastern extreme of this part of the reef ; along the steep eastern side, to the northward, are the rocky islets Marmotier, Blanc ile, Tas de Pois, and Vielle ; the two latter being conical rocks 20 and 24 feet high respectively above the same level. On the south-western side are the high rocks Cotes and Colombier ; and, northward of them, the Grosse Tete and Petite Tete, the latter being the only one that ever covers with the tide. Maitre ile, Marmotier, and Blanc ile are the largest of the Ecrehos group, and on each there are huts for the use of fishermen. Maitre ile alone is large enough to preserve its soil from being swept away by wind and sea and is therefore the only islet having any vegetation, which consists of coarse grass and a few stunted shrubs. Large rats abound, but neither fresh water nor fuel are to be found on any of these islets, which are, however, visited by Jerseymen during the summer season, for the purpose of fishing and cutting vraic. Maitre ile being one of the principal stations for the survey of Jersey, the exact position of the instrument is marked by a pole surmounted by a barrel with a large pile of stones at its base ; it stands on the highest part ot the island near the middle, and is a conspicuous and useful beacon. Along the eastern side of the main reef of the Ecrehos, but sepa rated from it by a narrow channel, is a tangled mass of rocky reefs, narrow at its northern end near the Vielle but widening and increasing its distance from the main reef as it extends southward, with an outward curve to abreast of Maitre ile, from which its outer edge is a mile distant. Here the rocks suddenly terminate and the Ecreviere bank, of gravel and sand, commences and extends nearly 2 miles farther southward.

Its greatest breadth, near the northern end, is 5 cables, and it tapers off to about 2 cables wide at its southern extreme. The bank is very steep along its western side ; its surface consists of a number of ridges of fine gravel and sand, convex to the south westward, nearly parallel with and close to each other, many of them drying from 3 to 5 feet, and separated only by narrow channels from 3 to 8 feet in depth. The stream setting over this bank causes a confused sea in bad weather.

THE RUAU CHANNEL, between the Drouilles rocks and Jersey, is at its narrowest part 2\\ miles wide, from 12 to 18 fathoms deep, and free from danger, but the confused sea caused by a strong weather tide over the rocky uneven bottom is sometimes so violent as to resemble breakers. The northern entrance to the Ruau, between the Drouilles and Pierres de Lecq, sometimes called the Drouilles channel, is 4^ miles wide and free from danger. The approach from the westward, between the Pierres de Lecq and Jersey, is also roomy and safe ; and, any sea man with a good chart may safely take his vessel through the Ruau channel and into Gorey outer road without a pilot. When the marks are indistinct, or at night, vessels should endeavour to keep in mid-channel when passing between the Pierres de Lecq and the Jersey coast, and through the Ruau channel. PASSE DE L'ETOC is the principal passage between the Drouilles and Ecrehos reefs ; it leaves to the westward the whole of the Drouilles rocks ; and, to the eastward, the Grande Rousse, Etoc, and Fierco rocks, besides the Grune du Nord-Ouest, Grune du Sud- Ouest, and many others. The narrowest part of the channel is between the Platte rock and Grune du Sud-Ouest, where it is only 3 cables wide.

Directions. \u2014 The best leading mark for the Passe de l'Etoc is Seymour house on with the breakwater house at Verclut point S.S.W.; but, if from the southward, when passing abreast of Grune du Sud- Ouest, Seymour house may be brought a little westward of th\u00ab breakwater house, provided that the leading line is regained imme diately afterwards to avoid passing too near the Platte. The sam6 may be done to give a good berth to a 7-feet rock which lies with Taa de Pois and the Etoc rock in line. The Passe de l'Etoc has a general depth of 8 fathoms, and the bottom, although very rocky, is tolerably regular ; both tides, how ever, set across it for a considerable time, and no stranger should attempt to pass through without a pilot. There is a 5-fathoms channel between the Grande and Petite Rousse rocks, for which the leading mark is, St. Catherine's light house on with the martello tower northward of Mont Orgueil S.W. | S., but it is in some places little more than a cable wide and studded with rocks ; about half tide, a vessel of 12-feet draught with a leading wind may safely pass through, but, below half tide, it is unsafe even for boats. Giffard and Bonne Nuit bays. \u2014 Fremont point, a high bluff, is 8 cables westward of Belle Hougue point ; between them are these two small bays divided from each other by Crete point, on which is a fort. Giffard bay, the easternmost of the two, is small, but the ground is clean. See charts, Nos. 62 a and b."], [320, "292 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. Bonne Nuit bay may be easily recognised by St. John's barracks, a long range of low buildings near the middle of it j also, by Mont Mado mill, which stands on the high land above and westward of them. Near the middle of the bay, about 2 cables from the shore, is the Cheval,a large black rock which only covers at high springtides, with several sunken rocks half a cable outside it. A reef extends 2\\ cables northward from Fremont point ; at its outer extreme is the Demie, a rock which dries 16 feet. Anchorage. \u2014 The best berth is about 2\\ cables northward of Crete point, in from 6 to 8 fathoms, sand and gravel. A vessel here is well sheltered from southerly and westerly winds, but should be prepared to slip in case of a sudden shift of wind to the northward. Shamrock bank is a bed of rocks nearly 2 cables in diameter. The least water, 9 feet, is at the southern part of the bank, and there are from 6 to 12 fathoms close round it. From the 9-feet rock, Fremont point well open westward of the Demie rock bears S. by E. 6 cables ; Plemont hotel is just within the outer part of Ronez point ; the western house of St. John's barrack is a little open eastward of Fremont point ; and Tour de Rozel is over the outer extreme of Belle Hougue point S.E. \\ E. Plemont and Ronez points in line W. by N. \\ N. lead in-shore of the Shamrock bank, a close mark for the 9-feet patch. St. John's bay, between Fremont and Ronez points, is but a slight indentation of the coast ; its shore is, moreover, so fringed with rocks as to be almost inaccessible, and outlying rocks extend in some parts nearly 2 cables from the shore, between which and the Sham rock bank is a passage 4 cables wide. Strangers are advised, however, not to attempt passing through this channel without a pilot, nor to approach the land hereabout nearer than a mile. This part of the coast is remarkable from the extensive granite quarries which add to its naturally barren and wild appearance. RONEZ, SOREL,AND PLEMONT POINTS, unlike Belle Hougue and Grosnez points, are all low at their outer extremes, but rise at rather steep inclines to the high level plateau, which is the remarkable feature of the northern coast of the island, at distances of but little more than a quarter of a mile. See chart, No. 62 b."], [321, "Chap. VI.] 293 NORTHERN COAST.\u2014 DANGERS. Ronez and Sorel points are steep-to, but between and about 100 yards outside them is the Grune de Vicq, a sunken rock with only 3 feet water, which may be cleared on its northern side by keep ing Lipende point open of Ronez point until Plaine point is open of Sorel point. Plaine point has a reef extending about 100 yards from it ; outside of which, however, it is steep-to. From Plaine point to Greve de Lecq the coast is cliffy, precipitous, and dangerous of approach, having outlying reefs and sunken rocks extending from 2 to 3 cables off-shore. GREVE DE LECQ BAY is near the middle of the bight between Sorel and Plemont points ; its position may be recognised at a distance by a whitewashed martello tower over the middle of its high sandy beach. The anchorage off Greve de Lecq is good and safe with all except northerly winds ; the best position is in from 9 to 6 fathoms, sand, with Greve de Lecq martello tower bearing between South and S.S.W. W. from 4 to 6 cables distant ; at the inner and western position, Plemont point is open of Grand Becquet head. The dangers in or near Greve de Lecq are as follows : \u2014 The Demies, of which the highest dries 16 feet, If cables from the eastern headland of the bay, and N.N.E. \\ E. 3| cables from the white martello tower. This rock is surrounded by others which dry at low water to the distance of half a cable, and the ground between them and the shore is rocky and foul. Grune de Becquet, with 21 feet water, bears N.E. 5\u00a3 cables from Grand Becquet head. From the rock, Grosnez point seen over the low point of Plemont bears W. \u00a3 N., and Greve de Lecq martello tower S. | W. Grune de Douet, with 12 feet water, is 3\u00a3 cables in-shore of the Grune de Becquet, and E. | N. 3 cables from Grand Becquet head. GREVE AU LANCON BAY, between Plemont and Grosnez points, is small but remarkable from its fine level white sandy beach, which, however, unlike Greve de Lecq, is entirely covered by the tide long before high water ; at which time, the sea rolls into the See charts, Nos. 62 b and c."], [322, "294 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. numerous caverns of the cliffs bounding the bay, cutting off all communication with the high land above and imparting a wild aspect to the coast. The dangers here are, a rock which dries 14 feet one cable from the shore, on the western side of the bay ; and the reef extending a cable from Plemont point, which dries at low water. Small vessels bound southward round Grosnez point between half flood and half ebb, and unable to stem the tide, may advantageously anchor in this bay until half ebb, when the southern tide will have made and favour their proceeding through the swashway ; or, if bound eastward between the Pierres de Lecq and the island, and having anchored on the ebb, they can weigh at low water and carry a fair tide as far as Coupe point. The best anchorage is off the middle of the bay, with Grosnez bluff bearing about West, in from 9 to 6 fathoms, sand, but the holding-ground is not good and a sailing vessel approaching or leaving the bay must be prepared for unsteady flaws of wind from the high land, and varying eddies of tide. Caution. \u2014 No sailing vessel should anchor in any of the bays along the northern shore of Jersey with a northerly wind, but, should a vessel be surprised at anchor by a sudden shift of wind to that quarter, it may be advisable not to weigh until the weather tide makes, in order to ensure getting out. PIERRES DE LECQ or PATERNOSTERS is a rocky group, of which the western end in 5| fathoms bears N.N.E. \u00a3 E. 2| miles from Grosnez point ; they are nearly abreast of Greve de Lecq bay, and Great rock, their central and highest head, bears N. by E. \\ E. easterly, 2| miles from the white martello tower in that bay, and is about 35 feet above the high water level. Three other large rocks which never cover lie near the middle but towards the south-eastern side of the reef, one of them north-eastward of the Great rock, the other two, south- westward of it. The reef dries in numerous places north-westward of the Great rock for nearly a mile ; and, south-eastward of it are rocky banks, of which the outer one, with 20 feet water, is distant 6 cables. The most dangerous rock in this quarter is the Grune de Lecq, which dries 2 feet and bears S. by E. \\ E. 4j cables from the Great rock. See charts, Nos. 62 b and c."], [323, "Chap.

A nearer mark for the former is St. Peter's mill on with Greve de Lecq flagstaff S. by E. \\ E. Tour de Rozel shut in behind Belle Hougue point S.E. \u00a7 E. leads south-westward of them ; it must, however, be well shut in to clear the outer patch of the S.W. Grune, on which there are 17 feet. The white tower in Greve de Lecq bay on with the eastern point of that bay S.W. W., or the outer house on Grosnez on with the apex of Plemont point W.S.W. clears the south-eastern side ; and, Rozel mill on with the Colombiere rock, eastward of Belle Hougue point, S.S.E. \u00a3 E., leads north-eastward. If Rozel mill cannot be made out, the whole of Jethou island shut in behind Little Serk is a good mark for clearing the Pierres de Lecq on their north-eastern side. By night, St. Catherine's breakwateryw-ed white light kept opening and shutting in with Coupe point S.S.E. -\\ E. leads in mid -channel between the Pierres de Lecq and the Drouilles. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The necessity for taking regular and careful soundings cannot be too deeply impressed on the mind of the mariner when approaching the Channel islands, or when navigating amongst them at night or in thick weather ; for, although the islands and reefs generally are steep-to, so that the lead may give little or no warning, it is possible for a vessel to be set inside their boundaries without seeing them, when a knowledge of the depth might enable her to anchor and thus save the vessel. Mariners are also cautioned against placing dependence on making out the distant marks for out-lying dangers, many of which can only be distinguished in very clear weather and by those acquainted with the localities. Moreover, there are extensive banks of gravel and sand amongst the islands as well as other occasional irregularities in the bottom, which the careful pilot would know how to turn to account in estimating his position ; and, on the French coast eastward of the islands, the soundings are generally so regular that the lead may be taken as a safe guide in estimating distances from that shore. When the position is uncertain and the lead is hove, it is often useful to keep it on the ground for a minute or two in order to note the direction and strength of the tidal stream. For, as the streams See charts, Nos. 62 a, b, and c. SO 11886 'I'"], [324, "296 [Chap. VI. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 JERSEY. vary considerably both in strength and direction, according to position, and as diagrams giving precise information on this subject are engraved on the charts, a reference to the chart with the know ledge thus gained may be very useful. When the stream is running strongly, tide ripples and overfalls always make their appearance over sunken rocks, out-lying banks, or other exposed places ; in foggy weather, therefore, such indications may be turned to good account. In thick weather an anchor should always be ready when navigating among the islands ; but, before letting go, if possible, always turn the vessel's head to the tide, or there will be great danger of parting the cable. APPROACHES BY NIGHT.\u2014 From the Westward.\u2014 Endeavour to make either the Hanois or Roches-Douvres light and fix the position of the ship accurately by bearings before shaping a course for the Corbiere light or for Grosnez point, according to whether the vessel is proceeding by the southern or northern coast of Jersey. Should a vessel pass inside the line of these lights in thick weather without seeing them, the lead should be frequently hove until the Corbiere light is seen and the position ascertained beyond doubt. On the meridian of the Hanois, 34 fathoms will be obtained, shoaling to 32 and 30 fathoms along the Deroute channel as far as Serk ; whilst, southward of a line drawn from the Roches- Douvres to Grosnez point, the depths are less, varying between 26 and 23 fathoms. If bound for St. Helier, when within 2 or 3 miles westward of the Corbiere it is safest to heave to and wait for daylight. In thick weather, do not approach the Corbiere into less than 17 or 18 fathoms, and lay the vessel's head N.W. by N. during the whole of the flood, as the stream sets strongly down towards the Minquiers, and many vessels have been lost on that reef through neglecting this precaution. A steam-vessel of light draught with a good pilot, in a fine clear night and during the upper half of the tide, may safely proceed from this position to St. Helier harbour. Having brought the Corbiere light to bear East distant 2\\ or 2 miles, she should steer direct for Noirmont point, which should be approached within 2\\ cables, and, from thence, she should steer out a little to ensure clearing the Pignonet rock ; then, E. by S. for the entrance of the Little road, keeping a look out for the green and red leading See charts.

VI.] GENERAL DIRECTIONS. lights on Albert pier, and when they are in line keeping them so up to the entrance of the harbour ; see also directions, pages 237 and 251-258. From the South-west. \u2014 Do not approach the reefs fronting St. Aubin bay into a less depth than 10 or 12 fathoms ; should this depth be obtained and the vessel's position be doubtful, anchor if practicable and wait for daylight. From the North-West.\u2014 From St. Peter Port, Guernsey, steer so as to sight the white light on the Corbiere rock on or a little eastward of a S. by E. \\ E. bearing, which on a clear night will be done shortly after passing St. Martin's point ; take care to keep in the white sector of light, and when Grosnez point bears E.S.E., if it be desired to pass outside West rock, on which, however, there are 6 fathoms, steer S.W. by S. until past it ; after which, steer to pass 2 or 3 miles westward of the Corbiere, where a vessel should heave to and wait for a pilot or for daylight. Should there not be too much swell, a vessel could anchor for a time on the Great bank in from 5 to 8 fathoms N.W. by N. about 1^ miles from Corbiere light ; or between this position and No. 3 martello tower in St. Ouen bay, where the water is generally smoother and the tidal stream not so strong. From the Northward.\u2014 Having made cape de la Hague light, enter the Race of Alderney, see page 386, as near mid-channel as possible, and, from thence, steer S. by W. or S.W. by S., according to the state of the tide, passing 4 or 5 miles eastward of the Bane de la Schole. Should the weather be clear, the position of the ship may be ascertained and the course regulated by the coast lights with accuracy. If the lights are obscured, it is best not to enter the Race until daylight ; but, if compelled to do so, remember that a moderate depth and good anchorage may always be secured by hauling in towards the French coast ; see pages 207-210 and 214. Should there be too much swell to anchor, and the weather be moderately clear, Serk is very steep-to and safe of approach except on a north-westerly bearing, in the direction of the Blanchard rock During the upper half the tide, if it is desired to maintain a position near Serk, bring the middle of that island to bear S.W. : and, during the lower half, N.N.E. ; in calm weather, the drift will then be away from the island.

From the middle of the Race towards the eastern coast of Jersey, to pass through the Drouilles channel, steer as directed until cape de Carteret light bears about E. by S. St. Catherine's light should now be seen if the weather is clear, and, kept opening and shutting in with Coupe point S.S.E. J E., it leads eastward of the Pierres de Lecq and nearly midway between the Drouilles and Belle Hougue point. When inside the Drouilles, open St. Catherine's light of Coupe point, and do not approach Jersey nearer than a mile ; after passing the light, bring it to bear N.N.W. \u00a7 W. from one to 1| miles distant, and anchor in about 9 fathoms until daylight. Should St. Catherine's light not bo- seen when cape de Carteret light bears E. by S., proceed with caution ; bearing in mind that from the northernmost of the Pierres de Lecq, cape de Carteret light bears E. | S., and that a line drawn from the one to the other clears the northern extreme of the Drouilles reef by a mile. The Drouilles are all so low that they would hardly be seen at night until a vessel was amongst them ; but, as they are faced on their northern side by a fringe of sunken reef or bank, the lead, if carefully attended to should give warning of their neighbourhood. The Pierres de Lecq being steep-to on the eastern side and some part of the rocks always visible, are much safer to approach at night than the Drouilles. Of course neither these nor any other dangers should be approached under circumstances of difficulty with the tide. Grosnez bluff bearing W. | S. just clears the inner or southern edge of the Pierres de Lecq reef. If bound through the Deroute channel round the western coast of Jersey ; from the middle of the Race steer S. by W. or S.W. by S., as before directed, until cape de Carteret light bears E.S.E., to clear the Blanchard rock off Serk ; then haul out westward into the Deroute channel clear of the Pierres de Lecq and of the Bane Desormes, and when the Corbiere white light is in sight bearing S. by E. \\ E. a S. by W. course may be steered until within 2 or 3 miles abreast of the Corbiere rock, where a vessel should heave-to and wait for daylight, or act as already directed in coming from the westward. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 Along the northern and southern shores of Jersey, between Grosnez point and Belle Hougue point on the North, and between Corbiere rock and Seymour tower on the South, the whole of the flood stream runs eastward and the ebb westward, See charts, Nos. 62 a, b, and c."], [327, "Chap. VI.] GENERAL DIRECTIONS. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. 299 following the trend of the land, and each for 6 hours, the velocity at springs being about 4 knots, and at neaps about 2 knots. In Grouville, St. Catherine, and St. Ouen bays, the stream runs northward between half flood and half ebb, and southward between half ebb and half flood, with a velocity in each case of 4^ knots at springs and 2\\ knots at neaps ; the streams consequently meet off the four extremes of the island, viz., Coupe point, Grosnez point, Corbiere point, and the Conchiere rock. The rotary changes of direction of the tidal stream round Jersey being the governing cause of the various sets close to its shores, some description of its action is necessary. Assuming, therefore, the time of high water and a position about 4 miles S.W. of St. Helier, the stream which has been hitherto setting S.E. and East now quickly alters its direction to N.E., which a glance at the chart will show is full on to the southern coast of the island, making the space included between the assumed position and the land what pilots call the crown of the tide, and causing slack water as the shore is approached. The northern side of the island, at this time lying in the lee or eddy, slack water is caused there also ; but, along the eastern and western coasts, the tide is setting northward at its full strength. At half ebb, the offing stream has veered round from North to N.W. and S.W. ; the crown of the tide is now on the eastern side of Jersey, and the western side is in the lee or eddy, causing slack water at this time in Grouville and St. Ouen bays at the opposite ends of the island, the stream at the same time running at its full strength westward along the northern and southern coasts of the island. At low water, the stream is setting from the northward on to the northern shore of Jersey, making the crown of the tide on that side and the lee on the southern side of the island, causing slack water on those sides whilst the stream is running with its full strength southward along the eastern and western sides. At half flood, the crown of the tide is on the western coast, the lee on the eastern side with slack water on those sides, whilst the stream is setting with its full strength eastward along the northern and southern shores. A careful consideration of this rotary action of the tidal stream serves to explain all peculiarities of the tides in the bays of the island. Thus at, Noirmont point near half flood, when the eastern See charts, Nos. 62, a, b, and e."], [328, "[Chap. VI. 300 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 JERSEY. stream attains its full strength, there is an outset from St. Aubin bay, which runs with considerable strength between Pointe de But and the Pignonet rocks, and is perceptible within the bay as far as St. Aubin castle ; at first, this is a mere eddy of the flood stream originating under Noirmont point, but as, after half flood, the stream shifts from East to N.E. and sets right on the Hermitage rocks and Elizabeth castle, the very gentle incline of the sandy shore here and the great space to be covered causes the level of the sea at this part of the bay to be considerably raised above that of the western side, and the water necessarily runs off in the direction of the lower level. On referring to the chart it will be seen that the form of the bay tends to deflect the stream from a north-easterly to a northerly direction ; it is not, therefore, difficult to understand why the small eddy under Noirmont point, when reinforced by the westerly flow round the head of the bay, becomes the continuous outset from Noirmont point just described ; this outset runs for 9 hours, viz., from half flood to high water and during the whole of the ebb ; it attains its greatest strength about an hour after high water, and at this time, during a westerly gale at spring tides, it throws up a dangerous breaking sea or race off Noirmont point. From similar causes, viz., the shifting and impinging on the land of the offing stream, the tide sets northward across the mouth as well as into the harbour of St. Helier during the whole of the flood, and southward during the ebb, except near the Bridge inside Elizabeth castle, where the tide sets north-westward from the last quarter flood until the Bridge is awash at one foot below half tide. In the offing, south- westward and clear of the island, the strength of each tidal stream runs fairly N.W. or S.E., remaining longer near those points than any other ; and it has been already shown that near high water it quickly changes its course to East and North-east, at this latter point running full on the island and making high water there. It does not, however, continue in this direction for any length of time, but veers round by North to a north-westerly direction, where its shifting movement is much slower ; the strength of this north-western stream is felt at half ebb on the southern coast of Jersey. To arrive ata right understanding of the force and effect of the ocean swell along the southern coast of Jersey in westerly gales, it is necessary to follow this changing direction of the offing stream. See charts, Nos. 62 a, b, and c."], [329, "Chap. VI.] 301 TIDAL STREAMS. An hour before high water, on the slacking of the south-eastern stream in the offing, the western stream sets round Noirmont point to the westward, checking the advancing westerly swell during gales from that quarter, and causing it to break heavily. As this natural breakwater forms off Noirmont point and its outlying reefs, the water within and to leeward, both in St. Aubin bay and St. Helier road, becomes smoother, and, as the western or ebb stream increases in strength so does the swell continue to decrease. After the tide has fallen below half ebb, the outlying reefs, gradually uncovering, assist materially in blocking out the swell, but, after low water, the offing stream changes, and the westerly swell rolls in again with the eastern stream, increasing in force with the rising tide, until again checked by the slacking of the offing stream and the making of the western stream in-shore.

GENERAL REMARKS.\u2014 In the opening pages of the preceding chapter the appearance of Guernsey, when first sighted from the westward, as contrasted with Jersey, is fully described, and general information given on the approaches to the Channel islands, as well as on the peculiarities of wind and weather, soundings, and tides, so far as the islands generally are affected. Tides, &C. \u2014 A detailed description of Guernsey, Herm, and Serk now follows ; and it may be well here to remark that the depths as well as heights in the Admiralty chart of Guernsey are reckoned from a zero of low water, mean springs (see also page 4). The lowest tide registered at Guernsey from 1858 to 1868 fell 3 feet 9 inches below that zero. On February 10th, 1887, the lowest tide on record took place, the tide falling 4 feet 6 inches below the zero, and the range of the same tide being 33 feet 6 inches. The least range of tide recorded in Guernsey is 6 feet ; it took place both on April 7th and September 36th, 1858.

As the coast is approached, the northern part of the island sloping gradually northward from the high southern plateau begins to rise above the horizon, presenting a surface diversified with houses churches, windmills, and groups of trees, all of which become still more conspicuous if seen from a north-westerly direction. The western shore of Guernsey is studded with precipitous rocks, of which many are wholly detached from the land. On the high land above St. Martin's point at the south-eastern end of the island is a stone column, erected in honour of Lieut.-General Sir John Doyle ; it is 96 feet high, with its summit 384 feet above the level of high water. Another remarkable object is the Victoria tower, 100 feet high and its summit 301 feet above high water, erected on the heights above St. Peter Port to commemorate the visit of Her Majesty the Queen in 1846. It is a square tower, slightly tapering from its base, surmounted by a battlemented gallery, with square turrets at its angles. The island of Guernsey is nearly in the form of a right-angled triangle, the north-western side forming the hypothenuse, the length of which is about 8 miles. The land on the southern side is high and steep, its average height being about 300 feet ; the highest part is Hautnez, over Icart bay, which is 337 feet above the level of high water, but it gradually lowers toward the North, where, in some places, it is little above the sea level. The island is encompassed by many dangerous rocks, of which the principal are the Hanois, Sambule, and Grunes, on the western and north-western sides ; the Braye rocks with several others on the northern side ; and, on the north-eastern and eastern sides lie the Amfroque rocks, together with the islands of Herm and Jethou, which are also themselves surrounded by numerous rocks and ledges. Guernsey contains 16,000 acres of fertile and highly cultivated land ; its population in 1891, including Herm and Jethou, was 35,339. The island does not grow grain enough, nor raise a sufficient number of cattle to supply its inhabitants. Approach from the Westward. \u2014 Vessels bound to Guernsey from the westward should not approach the island in thick weather within a depth of 40 or 38 fathoms, unless certain of their position. Careful allowance should also be made for the flood stream setting in towards the island. See charts, Nos. 262 a, b, and c."], [332, "[Chap. VII. 304 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 GUERNSEY. The water is deep 2 cables westward of Hanois lighthouse, described at page 309 ; but, from it, dangerous rocks extend S.S.W. 3^ cables, N.N.W. 7^ cables, and North one mile. The Grune de l'Ouest, or du Nord-Ouest, a rock which dries 10 feet at low water, springs, bears N.E. \\ E. 5 miles from Hanois lighthouse ; several sunken rocks on which the sea breaks heavily in bad weather lie outside and westward of it, of which the Boue Blondel, the most western, has only 5J fathoms water and bears from the lighthouse N. by E. E. 3f miles ; it is therefore recommended in order to clear all these dangers, that vessels from the South or West passing westward of Guernsey at night, should not bring Hanois light west ward of South until the Casquets light bears E.N.E. Anchorages. \u2014 Rocquaine and Perelle bays, on the western coast of Guernsey, are so surrounded by rocks as to be unsafe of approach for any but the smallest vessels ; there are, however, several anchorages on the southern side, especially at Icart and Petit Port bays, where, with an off-shore wind, a vessel may stop for a tide ; but even they are not safe for a stranger to approach, and no vessel without a pilot should close the southern coast so as to shut in the North point of Serk with Jerbourg bluff. St. Peter Port road, on the eastern side of the island, affords good shelter except with the wind between S.W. by S. and S.E., and the holding-ground is excellent. There is also good anchorage at the northern end of the Great bank, on the eastern side of the island, as well as on the northern coast off Fort Doyle, and in l'Ancresse, Grand Havre, Cobo, and Vazon bays ; but, at most of these places it is necessary to employ a pilot. Pilotage. \u2014 By ordinance of the Royal Court of Guernsey it is enacted, under penalty of a fine at the discretion of the court, that every pilot boat shall carry a flag, half red and half white, the white part uppermost ; the letter P to be marked in black on the white part, and the pilot's number in white on the red part near the centre of the flag. And, that every ship or vessel above 50 tons burthen, new admeasurement, shall be bound to take a pilot, both on her arrival in this island and on her departure, on pain of paying the usual pilotage to the pilot who shall first have presented himself for the purpose of undertaking the conduct or pilotage thereof.

In case a pilot is prevented by tempestuous weather from getting on board a ship or vessel at sea, such ship or vessel and the pilot-boat shall so manage as to enable the pilot-boat to take the lead and serve as a guide, and such ship or vessel shall pay the same pilotage as if the pilot had actually gone on board. Rates of Pilotage, Beacons. \u2014 When beacons marking rocks in the vicinity of Guernsey require renewing, each beacon is, as far as possible, capped with the initial letter of the name of the rock on which it stands ; thus, for instance, the Vermerette beacon in the Passe Percee instead of bearing a triangle as formerly, is now surmounted by the letter V in white. Tidal Streams.* \u2014 The eastern or flood stream makes close in-shore soon after low water along the southern and north-western coasts of Guernsey, whilst the south-western stream is still running at its strength in the offing 4 miles westward of the island ; between these positions the streams vary in strength and direction as one or the other is approached. The flood stream between Guernsey and the rocks projecting from the south-western end of Jethou island takes two different directions ; See charts.

[Chap. VII. one part runs directly through the Great road and Little Russell channel ; the other branches off nearly at right angles and runs eastward towards Jethou, passing through the before mentioned rocks and into the Great Russell. The ebb stream takes exactly the reverse direction, the stream from the Great Russell, after having passed through the rocks of Jethou, uniting with that through the road, and both setting south- westward. With Grande Braye rock a boat's length open westward of Brehon tower, a vessel keeps in the stream which sets through the road and Little Russell, but the Grande Braye on with Brehon tower places her in the indraught of the Great Russell. A vessel working into Guernsey road from the southward derives great advantage by paying attention to this division of the stream. It is high water in the Great and Little Russell channels at the same time as at St. Peter Port, viz., at 6h. 37m., full and change, the last half of the falling and the first half of the rising tide occurring with the south-western stream ; and, the last half of the rising and first half of the falling tide with the north-eastern stream. In other words, at low water by the shore at St. Peter Port the south-western stream has been running nearly 3 hours and is at its full strength ; and, at high water by the shore, the north-eastern stream has been running nearly 3 hours and is also at its full strength. Thus, off the eastern end of the island, the streams turn at about half tide by the shore and run nearly 5^ hours each way, allowing something more than a quarter of an hour for the slack at each change of stream. In the Great Russell, the strength of the north-western stream runs E.N.E. and of the south-western stream W.S.W. ; and, in the Little Russell the direction of the two streams at their greatest strength is N.E. \\ E. and S.W. \\ W. nearly. At the north-eastern entrance of the Little Russell, however, between the Braye and Amfroque rocks, it takes the direction of the offing stream, viz., the first two hours of the flood directly for the northern end of Herm island, gradually joining the south-western stream through the Russell, and the last hour of the flood as well as the first of the ebb joining the north eastern stream. To understand the various sets of the tides in the Russell channels, and round the outer shores of this group of islands, it is necessary to consider their governing cause, viz., the rotary change of direction in the offing stream, which in one tide runs in regular succession from every point of the compass. See charts, Nos. 262 a, b, and e."], [335, "Chap. VII.] TIDAL STREAMS. 307 At high water by the shore, as just shown, the stream is setting E.N.E. fairly through the Russell channels, and is then at its greatest strength, coinciding nearly with the general direction of the offing stream, which, at this time, westward of Guernsey is running E. by N., and eastward of Serk N.N.E. Three hours after high water, or at half ebb, the direction of the offing stream in its progressive change from North to West, &c, is about N.W. by N., which a glance at the chart will show to be right across the northern entrance of the Russell channels, producing, as might be expected, a slack tide in the Great Russell under the lee of Serk, and still more so in the Little Russell, protected as it is by Herm, Jethou, and the numerous rocks north ward and southward of those islands. At low water, the offing stream has got round to W.S.W., and as this is about the direction of the Russell channels, the south-western stream at this time attains its greatest strength. After low water, the island of Guernsey appears to obstruct some what the free course of the main stream into the channels eastward of it ; and, at half flood, partly owing to this obstruction and partly to the rising waters at the northern and southern ends of the island being pretty evenly balanced, and, notwithstanding the strong easterly stream along its northern and southern shores, slack water prevails throughout the whole extent of the Russell channels. The rising tide on the southern side gradually prevailing, causes the north eastern stream through these channels, attaining its greatest strength, as before stated, near high water. Consideration of the foregoing general remarks is necessary in order to understand the great diversity in the set of streams and eddies about these islands. It must be also remembered that a body of water once set in motion continues to move onward for some time after the removal of the originating force ; thus, the Russell streams continue to run south-westward for some time after the source of supply has been cut off, and until the greater and more rapid rise of tide southward of Guernsey causes a reversal of the stream. The south-westerly streams, when they meet the first of the eastern stream off St. Martin's point, blend with it and make a south-eastern stream which, at springs, runs with considerable strength from the northern end of the Great bank south-eastward for some distance outside the Tetes d'Aval. but is not felt inside the Great bank, nor near St. Martin's point. See charts, Nos. 262 a, b. and c."], [336, "308 [Chap. VII. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 GUERNSEY. The value of a thorough knowledge of the tides may be illustrated by following the track of a Guernsey boatman on a trip to the eastern side of Serk and back. He will take a fair tide the whole distance. Leaving Guernsey road a little after low water, he proceeds with a fair tide to the S.E., outside the Tetes d'Aval until he meets the eastern stream, with which he sails southward of Serk. Near l'Etac de Serk he runs into a northerly stream, which accompanies him along the eastern side of the island as far as Le Creux. On his return to Guernsey he will round the northern point of Serk about an hour after high water, at which time the turning of the offing stream towards the North removes the pressure of the Great Russell stream from the Bee du Nez and causes an eddy from it to the Givaude rock off Brecqhou, and he will carry an eddy or counter stream as far as the Givaude rock, outside of which he will meet the true stream setting north-westward at 2 hours after high water. Going with this stream, he will pass through the Passe Percee, and, crossing the Little Russell, arrive at St. Peter Port before the south-western stream has fairly made. Close to the coasts of the Channel islands, as well as in the offing outside them, the general drift of the tidal stream appears to corre spond with its rotary motion from right to left ; for, it has frequently happened that floating objects near the shore have been seen succes sively on their northern, western, southern, and eastern coasts. Moreover, part of a wrecked vessel having drifted from a rock near the Casquets during calm weather was known to take a south-westerly course, and to drift with a rotary motion through a succession of parabolic tidal curves at the rate of about 4 miles per day, round the western and southern coasts of Guernsey, several miles distant from the island, and up the Deroute and Race streams ; whilst other parts of the same wreck, having probably drifted off the rock at the commencement of the western stream, and having therefore been set farther out westward, were met with about the same time several miles within and eastward of the Roches-Douvres. Such examples prove the existence of a drift which coincides with the shifting movement of the tidal stream ; south-westerly from the Casquets, southerly past Guernsey, easterly and southerly between Guernsey and the Roches-Douvres, and northerly when eastward of the islands. The easterly and main branch of this drift, as already noticed,-passes up the Deroute and Race channels, and it seems h-'ghly See charts, Nos. 262 a, b. and o."], [337, "Chap. VII.] 309 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 HANOIS LIGHT. probable that after clearing the Race of Alderney it turns off west ward past that island, reunites with its own stream again off the Casquets, and repeats the same round as before in endless succession. This drift, commonly known as the \" indraught of the gulf of St. Malo,\" was formerly supposed to exist only during fresh westerly breezes, and doubtless its strength is greatly increased at such times, but there is now no doubt that between the Casquets and the Roches- Douvres it is continuous, and with a rate proportioned to the strength of the tidal stream. These facts serve to show that vessels going round the islands, as well as those navigating the channels between them, may occasionally shorten their passages materially by following the curves of the tidal streams instead of taking direct courses. Caution. \u2014 Although the north-eastern stream begins to set through the Little Russell at the same time as through the Great Russell, viz., at half tide, it has no northern inclination round St. Martin's point until 4 hours flood ; care must be taken therefore that the first of the eastern stream does not draw the vessel into the Great Russell or among the rocks in the vicinity of the Tetes d'Aval. HANOIS LIGHT.\u2014 The lighthouse on the Bise rock, the south western rock of the Hanois group, one mile off the western end of Guernsey, exhibits, at 100 feet above high water, a revolving red light of the first order, whk-h attains its greatest brilliancy every for tg -five seconds, and is visible 16 miles all round the horizon except when obscured by the island of Guernsey between the bearings of W. by S. \\ S. and N.W. \\ W.; the line of eclipse in this latter direction passes 3f miles south-westward of l'Etac de Serk.

Unless a vessel is well under command and in charge of a pilot, she should not approach these rocks nearer than 2 miles. ROCQUAINE BAY, between Lihou island on the North and the Grosse rock on the South, is 1^ miles wide ; it is fronted by numerous groups of rocks as well as by isolated ones, of which many are always above water, a far greater number uncover with the falling tide, and sunken rocks are still more numerous. The bay is only used by fishermen of the neighbourhood, or occasionally by vessels prepared to take the beach. Depths. \u2014 The anchorage in this bay is in from 15 to 17 feet ; it is well sheltered from northerly, easterly, and southerly winds, but westerly winds send in such a heavy sea, especially between half flood and half ebb, that no sailing vessel could work out against them. The holding-ground, consisting generally of fine gravel and sand covered with grass and sea- weed, is not good ; nevertheless, in the south-western part of the bay off Pezerie point, a vessel of 12 or 13 feet draught, well moored, would ride securely all the year round in about 23 feet water, under any circumstances of wind and weather.

Within the 5-fathoms line, it is nearly l\\ miles long and 2 cables wide, and has a general depth of from 21 to 27 feet ; there is a shoal patch of 18 feet near the centre, and one foot less water near the northern end. From its southern limit, St. Peter Port church is on with .the Anfre beacon ; and, from its northern limit, the northern angle of Castle Cornet, the old harbour lighthouse, and Elizabeth college tower are in one. The shoalest part, of 17 feet near the northern end, is 2 cables south ward of this latter line of direction, and, from it, St. Peter Port church is just open of the southern angle of Castle Cornet. The Anfre beacon and the white stone conical beacon on the top of Fermain point in line, lead northward of it and across the northern end of the bank in 20 feet. Clearing marks. \u2014 To pass eastward of all the rocks described near St. Martin's point, and westward of the shoal part of the Great Bank, keep Saumarez monument on with, or a little open eastward of, the end of Castle Cornet breakwater N. by E. \\ E. ; this mark also leads close outside the Piette, and the Anfre and Moulinet beacons, and between the Ferico and Oyster rocks up to the Tremies. ST. PETER PORT, the capital of Guernsey, stands on the eastern shore of the island, and, in 1891, its population numbered 17,041. From the sea, it has rather an imposing appearance, but it is irregularly built. It is the seat of government of the northern division (or Bailiwick, as it is termed) of the Channel islands, which includes Alderney, Serk, Herm, and Jethou. Its old tidal harbour is enclosed by the new harbour, formed between two breakwaters, with a depth in its entrance of 13 feet at low water, springs. Trade. \u2014 The principal articles of export are flowers, potatoes, grapes, tomatoes, melons, and other produce, also building stone, ind granite in a broken state for the repair of roads. The imports are British manufactures, coal, wine, spirits, sugar, coffee, and other provi sions, grain, &c. In the year 1893, the number of vessels belonging to the port was 84, their total registered tonnage 10,489 tons. In the year 1894, including the little port of St. Sampson's, See chart . No. 262 b."], [345, "Chap. VII.] GREAT BANK. \u2014 ST. PETER PORT. 317 2,699 vessels, of an aggregate tonnage of 350,000 tons, entered the port ; about one fourth of this tonnage was composed of sailing vessels. Repairs, &C. \u2014 There are two patent slips in the north-western part of the New harbour, one 145 feet long, the other 130 feet ; they can take vessels of 12 feet draught, and a vessel of 800 tons has actually been on the largest. There is no dock accommodation, and no appliances for the repair of iron ships or machinery ; moderate repairs on wooden vessels can be effected. Communication. \u2014 St. Peter Port is in telegraphic communi cation with England by cabje from its north-eastern point to Dart mouth, and with France through Jersey, also with Alderney by cable from l'Ancresse bay ; it is in daily communication by steamer with Southampton, Weymouth, and Jersey all the year round ; with London, Plymouth, Cherbourg, and St. Brieuc weekly ; with Bristol and Morlaix periodically ; with Alderney bi-weekly ; and, with Serk, thrice a week regularly, and almost daily in summer. There is an electric railway between St. Peter Port and St. Sampson harbours, a distance of 35 miles. Coal and supplies. \u2014 Coal in small quantities can be obtained at St. Peter Port, the stock in hand averaging from 200 to 400 tons, and the price from about 11. to 11. 2s. &d. per ton. Water is supplied from the reservoir at Havelet, the -charge for shipping being one shilling a ton. St. Peter Port market furnishes fresh meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit in abundance at a cheap rate. Depths. \u2014 Vessels can coal alongside the landing stage at the entrance of the port in 14 feet at low water, springs ; here there are 40 feet at high water, springs, and nearly 33 feet at neaps, and there is sufficient water from half flood to half ebb for a vessel of 26 feet draught to lie alongside. At the second, third, and fourth landing stages, there are respectively 12, 8, and 4 feet at low water, springs, at which time there are 13 feet in the entrance between the piers, and 10 or 11 feet near the middle of the pool, from whence the water shoals gradually and regularly towards the shore. Harbours. \u2014 The Old tidal harbour of St. Peter Port, 5 acres in area, is enclosed by piers of masonry 25 feet high, with an entrance See chart, No. 262 //."], [346, "[Chap. VII. 318 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 GUERNSEY . 80 feet wide facing East. On the southern pier-head is a lighthouse. The depth at high water, springs, between the pier-heads is 24 feet, and 16 feet at neaps ; the average depth along the quays on the same tides being respectively 20 and 12 feet. South-eastward of the Old harbour stands Castle Cornet, connected with the mainland by a massive granite causeway and wooden viaduct. The New harbour works comprise two esplanades, one on each side of the Old harbour, running parallel with the sea front of the town, and averaging together 835 yards in length and 50 yards in width. From the extremes of these esplanades extend two break waters, one on either side and equi-distant from the Old harbour, being 835 yards apart at the base and projecting eastward so as to enclose the natural sandy bay in front of the town ; the whole space of both harbours thus enclosed being about 73 acres, of which all but about 23 acres dries at low water, springs. The South or Castle Cornet breakwater is carried across the rocky isthmus, by which, at low water, Castle Cornet is connected with the shore, and terminates at the north-western bastion of the Castle, being 630 yards in length. The southern face of this breakwater consists of an upright wall and parapet of rough masonry 15 feet above the level of the highest tides, and along it is a level roadway and footpath 40 yards wide. From the north-eastern angle of Castle Cornet outwards, a rough stone breakwater projects 200 yards farther eastward, its end marked by a circular granite lighthouse. These works effectually screen the entrance of the harbour from the most exposed quarter, the southward, and add greatly to the security of the anchorage in the road. The North or St. Julien's breakwater and landing pier begins northward of the Old harbour, at the end of the esplande, and extends in an easterly direction about 465 yards to the head of the White rock, from whence it takes a southerly direction, a little outside the line of Castle Cornet, for nearly 300 yards, leaving an entrance 120 yards wide between the pier-end and the rocks off Castle Cornet, and completely sheltering the pool within. This pier has four landing stages for steamers along its inner side as already described. The bottom of the harbour is almost entirely of fine sand, except on the southern side, where is a rocky ledge marked on its edge by two buoys, one red, the other black. A Life-boat is stationed at St. Peter Port. Se* chart, No. 262 b."], [347, "Chap. VII.] ST. PETER PORT. \u2014 ROAD. \u2014 NEW HARBOUR. 319 ST. PETER PORT ROAD fronts the town north-eastward of Castle Cornet. The holding-ground is excellent, and the road affords good shelter against all winds between S.W. and N.N.E., but those from between N.E. and S.E., if strong, cause much sea and at such times a steamer does' well to leave these roads and seek shelter in the Grande Greve, Serk, see page 345. Winds from between S.W. by S. and S.E., also send in much swell and sea, especially on the ebb tide, rendering this anchorage then unsafe. Under such circumstances, smoother water may probably be found under the lee of the Great bank, where a vessel will be much safer than in the road, as, in the event of parting, she may run through the Little Russell and anchor off Fort Doyle or in l'Ancresse bay. Depths. \u2014 The best anchorage is within the following limits : \u2014 Southern limit, St. Peter Port church on with Castle Cornet break water end ; northern limit, Sardrette rock beacon and Victoria tower in line ; western limit, the outer angle of Castle Cornet on with the white beacon on Fermain point ; eastern limit, the Anfre beacon on with the eastern extreme of St. Martin's barracks. Within this space, there are from 5 to 11 fathoms, fine sand ; farther southward, the bottom is coarse and the depth increases to 20 fathoms. A vessel should, if possible, lie at single anchor, always keeping a second anchor ready ; but, if compelled to moor, the anchors should be laid in the direction of the stream. There is a Government 2^-inch mooring chain laid down in 5 fathoms, about 2 cables north eastward of Castle Cornet breakwater lighthouse, but as these moorings are not annually examined they should be used with caution ; within the harbour are several small mooring and warping buoys. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Peter Port at 6 h. 37 m. ; equinoctial springs rise 33 feet, ordinary springs 26 feet, neaps 18| feet above the soundings ; neaps range 11^ feet. The general level of the sea is liable to be depressed or raised 2 or 3 feet , or even more, by strong easterly or westerly winds.

Old harbour. \u2014 On the southern pier-head of the old harbour is a white wooden lighthouse, 20 feet high, from which, at 34 feet above high water, is exhibited a red fixed light, visible 7 miles ; it may be seen from the Russell channels, and also from the southward when St. Martin's point is rounded. When bearing W. by N. \\ N. it leads into the harbour. Belvedere. \u2014 From the high land of Belvedere, Fort George, b\\ cables S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. from Castle Cornet breakwater light and at about 200 feet above the level of high water, is exhibited a. fixed white light, visible 8 miles seaward between the bearings S. 15\u00b0 W. and N. 75\u00b0 W. This light in line with Castle Cornet breakwater light leads through the Little Russell channel, passing nearly half a mile northward of Platte Boue, about 100 yards north-westward of Roustel and Grune-au-Rouge buoys, and about 50 yards southward of Boue Agenor sunken rock. Beacons. \u2014 Northward of St. Peter Port, the eastern shore of the island is fronted by rocks and ledges and is very foul ; the outer and most important of these dangers are included in the description of the Little Russell channel ; see pages 331-335. Within 1\\ cables of the elbow of St. Julien breakwater, are three rocks marked by beacons. The Sardrette marked by a pole surrounded by a barrel, dries 19 feet, and borders the roadstead ; the Goubeau rock, marked by a black cone beacon surmounted by a pole and cross, striped black and white, is less than a cable northward of the Sardrette ; and, the Roche-a-deux-Tetes, with a black beacon, lies one cable in shore of the Goubeau. Directions. \u2014 A vessel from the westward bound to St. Peter Port or to the anchorage off the eastern side of Guernsey, and intending to pass southward of the island, should, as before stated, make careful allowance for the flood stream, if it be running, as it sets in towards the land. Rounding Pleinmon* point, give the lighthouse on the Hanois rocks a berth of at least 1\\ miles, to avoid the Hanois and Bise banks ; and, to clear the Hanois rocks, keep Corbiere point or La Moye point well open of Pleinmont point and of the Tas de Pois d'Aval rock. See charts, Nos. 262 b and c."], [349, "Chap. VII.] 321 ST. PETER PORT.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. To clear Pleinmont ledge and all dangers between it and La Moye point, do not shut in Lihou island with Pleinmont point until Serk church, which stands northward of the mill, is open of Jerbourg point. When abreast of La Moye point, open the northern point of Serk southward of Jerbourg point, or keep Pleinmont bluff open of Corbiere point, to avoid the Balleine rock, awash at low water, W.S.W. 2\\ cables from Icart point. After passing this point, keep Sommeilleuse guard-house, a ruin standing on the edge of a high and remarkable cliff a short distance eastward of La Moye point, open southward of Icart low point until Brehon tower opens east ward of the Longue Pierre beacon, or until the ruin of Herm mill touches the northern side of the high land of Jethou ; either of these marks lead outside the Grunes de Jerbourg. Rounding St. Martin's point, Saumarez monument on with the end of Castle Cornet breakwater N. by E. E. is the leading mark between the Anfre rock and Great bank, keeping St. Martin's barracks open southward of the Anfre beacon until Salerie battery opens of Castle Cornet breakwater, or until the breakwater lighthouse bears N.N.W. When the town church opens northward of the breakwater, anchor in the road as convenient, or run into the harbour if the tide serves. To pass eastward of the Great bank, keep Vale mill about midway between Mont Crevelt tower and Vale castle, and touching the eastern end of the breakwater of St. Sampson harbour, N. \\ E. ; and, when the town church is shut in behind Castle Cornet, haul in for the anchorage. At night, when running for this anchorage from the north-east ward, through the Great Russell, see page 336, steer south-westward until the red light on the South pier-head of St. Peter Port old harbour well open southward of Castle Cornet bears N.W. by N., which mark leads southward of the Tetes d'Aval and over the northern part of the Great bank in from 21 to 25 feet water. On nearing the castle and running for the harbour, bring the red light open northward of the white light on Castle Cornet breakwater, and, with the red light bearing W. by N. \\ N., anchor in the road or run on into harbour. The red light touching the southern part of Castle Cornet leads between the Tetes d'Aval and the buoy marking them, and only 50 yards southward of the rocks, and across the Great bank in 21 feet water. See charts, Nos. 262, a, b, and c."], [350, "[Chap. VII. 322 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 GUERNSEY. Steering for the Little Russell, see page 331, from the northward, keep the Casquets light on a N.E. by N. bearing until Belvedere light and Castle Cornet breakwater light are in line, bearing S.W. by W. \u00a3 W, which is the leading mark through the channel. This passage, however, should never be attempted at night by a stranger, nor even by a person acquainted with the place, unless in a steam-vessel of light draught or near high water. From the westward and southward by night, after passing St. Martin's point, steer to the eastward until the old harbour red light is seen clear of Torres point bearing North ; kept in sight on this line, it leads 2\\ cables eastward of the Longue Pierre beacon. When St. Martin's point bears S.W. \\ W., steer N.E. by N. to pass between the Anfre rock and the Great bank ; and, when Castle Cornet break water ivhite light bears N.N.W., steer N. by E. until the red light bears W. by N. \\ N., after which proceed as before directed. ST. SAMPSON'S HARBOUR is on the eastern side of Guernsey, 1\\ miles northward of St. Peter Port, between Vale Castle and Mont Crevelt ; it is rectangular in form ; its extreme length being about 1,900 feet N.W. and S.E. with an average width of 500 feet, and containing a water area of 22 acres at high water, springs. The site of the harbour was originally the eastern entrance to a strait which severed the northern portion of Guernsey from the main island. About the beginning of this century the strait was embanked at each end, and the intervening land reclaimed. There are two small patent slips in this harbour. Depths. \u2014 At low water, springs, the harbour is dry and the tide ebbs for a considerable distance outside the pier-heads. The entrance between the pier-heads is 120 feet wide, the depth at high water, springs, 22 feet, and at neaps, 15 feet. At neaps there are 12 feet along the southern pier, and 11 feet for a length of 150 feet along the South quay, from which spot it gradually shoals to its western end. A rocky patch, with 10 feet water, lies near the centre of the channel leading to St. Sampson's harbour ; from this patch, the Grunette beacon, representing the figure of a man, is just touching the southern side of Mont Crevelt battery ; and, St. Peter Port church is just open eastward of the Vivian rock beacon, painted with black and white rings. See chart, No. 262 b."], [351, "Chap. VII.] ST. SAMPSON'S HARBOUR.\u2014 GRAND HAVRE. 323 Directions. \u2014 The approach to this harbour is difficult, being athwart the tidal streams, and having the Crabiere, Grunette, Grande Demie, and other rocks off the entrance. The most dangerous of these is the Crabiere, dry at low water, in the fairway of the entrance and distant about one cable from the head of Mont Crevelt pier j it has, however, been reduced in height, having now 9 feet on it at half tide. The best entrance to the harbour is between the Crabiere and the Grunette beacon ; this passage, however, is not above 100 yards wide, and the leading mark is, the Grunette beacon on with the southern tangent of the pier until close up to the beacon, when pass 50 yards northward of it and steer in between the pier-heads. The bottom is blue clay covered with a layer of sand. Bordeaux harbour, half a mile northward of St. Sampson, is quite insignificant and used only by fishermen. Here small craft lie aground, but, as the entrance only admits vessels of about 10 tons, a further description is needless. Doyle fort. \u2014 One mile northward of Bordeaux harbour is Doyle fort, standing on the north-eastern point of Guernsey, off which lie the Brayes, Platte Fougere, and other rocks included in the descrip tion of the Little Russell channel, see pages 331-335 ; between these rocks and the shore is the narrow channel named Doyle Pass, see page 335. Half a mile westward of Doyle fort is l'Ancresse bay, and, westward of it, the land trends in a W. | S. direction about 6 miles to Lihou island. Telegraph cables. \u2014 The shore end of the telegraph cable connecting Guernsey with Dartmouth is landed near Doyle fort. That connecting Guernsey with Alderney is landed in l'Ancress* bay. L'ANCRESSE BAY, on the northern side of Guernsey, west ward of Fort Le Marchant, affords good shelter for small craft during south-easterly, southerly and westerly winds, in from 6 to 2 fathoms water. Victoria tower on with No. 6 martello tower, near the middle of the bay, S.S.W. f W., leads up to the anchorage. The bottom is muddy sand, and excellent holding-ground. GRAND HAVRE, 8 cables westward of l'Ancreose bay, has its entrance between Mont Guet on the North and Rousse point on the See chart, No. 262 b."], [352, "324 [Chap. VII. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 GUERNSEY. South, on both of which points are martello towers ; Vale church is near the shore at the head of the Havre. It affords excellent anchorage for small vessels in from 14 to 9 feet water, the bottom of sand and grass, with good shelter against southerly and easterly winds north-westerly winds, however, send in a heavy swell and sea between half flood and half ebb, though, with good ground gear, little danger is to be apprehended. For vessels capable of taking the ground, there is a safe place on the south-eastern side of Rousse point. The Rousse de Mer, a dangerous rock which uncovers at a quarter ebb, lies in the fairway of the entrance, and on each side of it are many more rocks. From the Rousse de Mer, Saumarez monument just shut in with the south-western angle of Vale church bears S. by E. \\ E. ; and the watch-house on the highest part of Lihou island on with the highest part of Grand Saut Roquier, W.S.W. Directions. \u2014 The dangers off the entrance to Grand Havre are very numerous, and extend fully 1\\ miles from the shore, so that it can be safely approached by only one channel. This channel lies between the Rousse de Mer and Main rocks ; the former dries 20 feet, the latter 5 feet at low water, springs. Victoria tower on with the rocky point just eastward of Rousse point martello tower S. \u00a3 W. (see view on chart, No. 262 b), leads in until Saumarez monument opens south- westward of Vale church ; then steer for the high rocky bluff near the middle of the bay, and anchor when about midway between the martello towers on the entrance points in about 10 feet water. A vessel of only 6 feet draught may anchor with Noirmont guard-house on with Rousse point martello tower, and Victoria tower about midway between Rousse point and the rocky bluff near the middle of the bay. Roque Noire, Boue Corneille, L'Etac and Saut Roquier rocks, lying from 7 to 8\u00a3 cables off-shore, between Grand Havre and Grande Roque point, extend fully a mile in an E. by N. and W. by S. direction. They are respectively 16, 6, 23 and 22 feet above high water, and thus serve to distinguish this part of the coast when the dangerous rocks around them are covered.

Some dangerous rocks, awash at low water, and one which uncovers 11 feet, extend W.N.W. nearly 2 cables from the Grand Saut Roquier ; others outside and northward of them are always covered ; the outer rock, called the Moulrette, has 27 feet water and bears N.N.W. \u00a3 W. 4\u00a3 cables from the Grand Saut Roquier. There is a good channel inside all these rocks, and anchorage, secure from easterly winds, will be found inside the Grand Saut Roquier. The leading mark through the channel is, the lower house on Lihou island just touching the outer corner of the Mouilliere rock W. by S. | S. ; there is also a channel between the inner heads of the Hoffets and Boue Corneille, but neither channel should be attempted without a pilot. The Plaquiere rock, with 8 feet water, lies half a mile westward of Grand Saut Roquier and 1| miles S.E.

It may be cleared by keeping Victoria tower well open on either side of Grande Roque tower. COBO and VAZON BAYS, half way between Grand Havre and Rocquaine bay, have good anchorage in easterly winds ; but, with westerly winds, there is generally a rolling swell along this coast on the flood tide, and this, together with the numerous outlying rocks, renders these bays dangerous of approach.

The Grande Amfroque is surrounded by dangerous rocks, of which the easternmost is the Bonne Grune, with 14 feet water, which bears from the Grande Amfroque E. \\ S. 1\u00a3 miles, and is at the western side of the entrance to the Great Russell channel. The Selle d'Amfroque, bearing N.E. | E. 5 cables from the Grande Amfroque beacons, has 17 feet over it ; and, within it, to the westward, lie the Demies du Nord and the Petite Amfroque, which uncover 10 and 27 feet respectively. Cul de l'Autel and Longue Pierre rocks.\u2014 At 6 cables West from the Grande Amfroque lies the Cul de l'Autel, a table rock about 32 feet above high water ; and, between the Cul de l'Autel and the northern point of Herm, at nearly equal distances, are the Longue Pierre and Traiffe rocks, 47 and 35 feet above the high water level, and also Godin islet, 37 feet, which, as well as the Longue Pierre, is covered with a light soil, on which grow a variety of wild flowers ; the Traiffe is near the south-eastern side of the Longue Pierre, and resembles a ship under sail. Besides these are many others of minor importance which do not cover, as well as numerous tidal rocks and ledges, and many sunken rocks. Platte Boue rock, 8 cables N. by W. westerly from the Grande Amfroque beacons, is the northernmost danger off Herm, at the eastern side of the entrance to the Little Russell, and consists of three heads ; the western head has one foot water, and the southern head 3 feet at low water, springs. It is about 20 feet in diameter and steep-to all round ; but, N.E. by E. 165 yards from it, is a rock with 15 feet water ; and, S.W. 3 cables from it is the Boufresse, a large flat rock which dries 8 feet.

Tautenay beacon turret on with Brehon tower is a very close mark, clearing its northern side by only half a cable ; and, Catel spire on with the north-western angle of Vale castle also clears it on the same side by less than a cable. The channels through and amongst these rocks and islets are extremely intricate, and are rendered dangerous byT the rapidity and variety of the tidal streams ; two of them, however, are sometimes used by ships in charge of Guernsey pilots, viz., Hayes channel, between Godin islet and the Longue Pierre rocks ; and, Passe Percee. between Herm and Jethou. HAYES CHANNEL.\u2014 This channel, though very narrow and tortuous, has nothing less than 35 feet at low water, at which time there is a rock awash at its eastern entrance, exactly in line between the Longue Pierre and Godin. Entering the channel from the eastward, to sail southward of this rock, keep Vale mill in sight southward of the Pierre de la Moue until past that line.

Anchorage. \u2014 Between Herm and Jethou, off the Mouette rock, is the Rosiere anchorage, where small vessels may find good shelter from all winds, except those from S.W. round by South to S.E. ; the best entrance is from the Great Russell channel. Tidal Stream. \u2014 The stream runs through the Passe Percee, nine hours to the southward and only three hours to the northward ; the southern stream commencing at low water by the shore, and setting directly into the Great Russell during the whole of the flood and until half ebb, when the northern stream begins and runs with but little strength until low water. A vessel, therefore, caught at this anchorage by a southerly wind may always, at half ebb, run northward through the Passe Percee into the Little Russell channel, and, from thence, to the anchorage inside the Cavale rock or into St. Peter port road. LITTLE RUSSELL CHANNEL, between Herm and Guernsey, is much contracted by the numerous rocks projecting from each island as far out as the Roustel on the Guernsey' side, which may, however, be almost considered a mid-channel rock, and the Rousse rock on the side of Herm, which two rocks are little more than 3 cables apart. The wind from N.N.W. round by North and East to S.E. is a leading wind through this channel from the north ward, and, without a leading wind, no square-rigged vessel of deep draught should attempt its navigation. The entrance to the Little Russell from the northward is between the Braye rocks on the western side and the Amfroque rocks on the eastern. The approach to both these groups is exceedingly dangerous on account of the tidal streams which set across the entrance to the Russell channels, and also from the numerous rocks, hidden and visible, by which they are encompassed, of which the most dangerous are, the Platte Boue and Boufresse belonging to the Amfroque group, described at page 328, and the Platte Fougere in the vicinity of the Braye.

Rousse rock.\u2014 Beacon.\u2014 The Rousse rock is 8 feet above high water, springs, and is marked by an iron beacon, consisting of a cross with an anchor fluke at each point ; it bears N.W. f W. 6 cables from the north-western point of Herm. A dangerous string of rocks, awash at low water, projects in a W. by N. direction 60 yards from the Rousse.

It leads a mile westward of the Platte Boue and rather more than that eastward from the Platte Fougere, and from thence along the eastern side of the channel, between the Roustel and Rousse rocks, and directly towards the Boues Gennete ; but when the high land at the north-eastern end of Serk begins to shut in with the northernmost bluff land of Herm, or when Saumarez monument appears within its breadth of Mont Crevelt tower W. \\ N., a vessel is between and abreast of the Roustel and Rousse rocks. Near this position, Belvidere house, a large building on the bluff eastward of Fcrt George, will be on with a white patch just within the eastern extreme of Castle Cornet, which mark leads more than half a cable eastward of the Grune au Rouge, about a cable eastward of the Agenor and all other dangers, and up to the anchorage in the road. This mark leads right up through the Little Russell, and is the only leading line that answers this purpose ; but, as it leads rather near the Grune au Rouge, on approaching and in passing that rock, keep the northern angle of Belvidere house on with the southern angle of the See chart, No. 26? b."], [363, "Chap.

When Brehon tower is on with Herm mill, in a ruinous condition, and without sweeps, one third from the southern end of the island, open the leading marks a little either way, to clear the Trois Grunes and the Agenor, and run on until the town church opens southward of the old harbour lighthouse, then haul in for the anchorage. If compelled to beat through the Little Russell, it may be useful to note that St. Martin's point open eastward of the Brehonnet rock, which dries 16 feet a cable westward of Brehon tower, clears the Roustel ; and, St. Martin's point open one side or the other of the Brehon rock clears the Boues Gennete also on either side. By night, Castle Cornet breakwater light and Belvidere light in line S.W. by W. W. is the leading mark through the Little Russell channel ; it leads well clear of the outer shoals but only about 130 yards westward of the Roustel and Grune au Rouge shoals, and very close eastward of the Trois Grunes and of the Agenor rock ; all of which, however, are easily avoided by opening the lights a little as may be necessary when in their vicing. DOYLE PASS.\u2014 To enter the Little Russell by this channel, keep the windmill on Serk just open northward of the northern most high land of Herm, and on with the Mouisonniere, bearing S.E. by S., which mark leads through the Pass between the Roque au Nord and the Grande Braye, inside the Grune Pierre which uncovers 4 feet, and between the Grune la Fosse and the Vraic, both awash at low water, into the fairway of the Little Russell. In taking this channel near low water, the greatest care must be used to preserve the leading mark ; the narrowest part is between the Grune Pierre and the rocks off Homptol, its width here being only 217 yards. With the leading mark on, the Pierre aux Rats obelisk appears a little to the left of the Mouisonniere, and, so long as the leading line is maintained, the least depth in this channel at low water, ordinary springs, should be 27 feet.

This channel, which is the eastern passage to Guernsey, is about 2 miles wide, with deep water, and easy of access even to strangers ; see views on charts, Nos. 262 a and b. The following are its principal dangers on the north-western side, commencing from the northward : \u2014 Bonne Grune rock, with only 14 feet water, is the outer danger at the northern entrance of the Great Russell. It bears E. by N. f N. 3 j miles from the northern end of Herm ; and, E. \\ S. 1\u00a3 miles from the Grande Amfroque beacons ; it is cleared 1^ cables to the eastward by opening the western extreme of Little Serk of the eastern bluff of Brscqhou. Noire Pute rock, 1| miles E. by S. \u00a3 S. from Herm mill, and S.W. southerly 3 miles from the Bonne Grune, never covers, though at equinoctial springs it is sometimes nearly awash, and all the rocks of the Amfroque group lie north-westward of a line drawn from the Noire Pute to the Bonne Grune. A string of rocks, awash at low water, extends from it north-eastward nearly 1^ cables ; from the Noire Pute, Doyle's column appears a quarter of a point open southward of the Grande Fauconniere. Grands Bouillons rocks, having only 9 feet water, lie between the Noire Pute and the Fourquies.

The north-eastern stream of tide slacks half an hour sooner on the south-eastern side of the Great Russell, that is to say under Serk, than on its north-western side. SERK.\u2014 This island is 3\u00a3 miles S.E. by S. from Herm, and divides the Great Russell from the Deroute channel. It is H miles wide and 2 J miles long, including Little Serk, with which it is connected by the Coupee, an isthmus or narrow causeway. It is high and precipitous throughout, and its highest part, at the base of the windmill near the centre of the island, is 349 feet above the level of high water. The small island of Brecqhou, on its western side, is separated from it by the Gouliot pass, a narrow channel only 70 yards wide, through which the tides run with great velocity. There is no town in Serk, but a small hamlet or group of cottages on the north-eastern side of the island is called La Ville. The island constitutes one Royal Fief or Manor, held direct from the Crown. There, are forty original copyhold farms, averaging 15 acres each, the titles to which descend in succession to the eldest sons, or if no sons, to the eldest daughters of their occupants. The island is fertile, highly cultivated, and, besides supplying all the wants of its inhabitants, exports largely in cereals and vegetables to Guernsey. Its rocky coast abounds with fish, and especially with crabs and lobsters. All able-bodied men are organized as militia, of which there are about 140 of all arms. Its total population in 1891 was 572. There is a church, where the Anglican service is conducted in French, and two endowed schools. A close approach to Serk on all but the north-western side is difficult, not only from the numerous rocks which eneompass it, but also from the rapidity and irregularities of the tidal streams in its immediate vicinity. These difficulties, however, may be easily overcome if attention is paid to the leading marks and run of the stream ; and, the island affords good shelter against almost all winds, as may be seen by following the descriptions given of the different bays.

It is on the eastern side of the island, and is the general rendezvous for landing and shipping goods, as well as the principal resort of the fishing and other island boats. It is protected by a small jetty and affords perfect security to small craft ; its entrance is, however, only 60 feet wide, and it dries at low water, springs. The best anchorage off it is with Pin rock on with the Grand Moie, and point Terrible on with High Cliff. Water. \u2014 On the south-eastern side of Serk there is a tolerable run of water in Ixcart bay, on the northern side of Baleine bay, westward of Chateau point ; the stream during the winter season is very copious, and water may be procured with off-shore winds without difficulty. It is the only accessible watering place round the island, with the exception of an inconsiderable drain in port du Moulin, on its north-western side, and another of similar character at Creux harbour. ISLETS and ROCKS around SERK.\u2014 The following islets and rocks, always above water, lie off the coasts of Serk : \u2014 The Noire Pierre, 2 cables from the shore off Banquette point on the northeastern coast, is a small square rock 11 feet above high water and steep-to all round. The Petite Moie, 57 feet above high water, is a rocky mass, steep-to except at its northern point, off which, at the distance of only 20 yards there is a sunken rock. The Grande Moie, off Robert point, is a larger rocky mass 91 feet above high water and dangerous to approach, especially on its eastern side. The Burons, are a cluster of craggy rocks 66 feet above high water in the form of a crescent, rising almost perpendicularly from the sea, steep-to on their south-eastern side, but dangerous to approach from any other quarter. They lie about 1^ cables distant in front of Creux harbour, and between them and Serk is the Goulet pass, which dries halfway across at low water, springs ; the deepest water, 4 feet, being towards the outer rocks of Creux.

The Conchee, about 5 cables southward of the Burons and lh cables south-eastward of point Terrible, is a square rock, 11 feet above high water, whitened at the top, and having sunken rocks close-to on all sides. The Baleine rock, in Baleine bay, is 20 feet above high water, and has a rocky reef extending 25 yards from its north-eastern side ; it is 1 1 cables from the shore. Pierre du Cours is a small rock awash at high water and very steep-to on its south-eastern side. As its name implies, it is a useful guide to vessels passing inside the Etac de Serk. Etac de Serk is a rocky islet about 200 feet high off the southern end of Little Serk. In form it resembles a hay-stack and is very conspicuous both from its appearance and position. It is steep-to on its eastern side, but a reef extends about 100 yards south-westward from it ; and, from its northern end, a ledge of rocks which dries 10 feet extends If cables in the direction of the Pierre du Cours. On the south-western side of Little Serk are numerous rocks, the most conspicuous of which are the Moie du Port Goury, a square topped rock, 64 feet above high water ; the Moie de la Bretagne, a peaked rock, 59 feet high ; and, the Moie de la Fontaine, 59 feet high and close to the shore. THE GIVAUDE ROCK is described at page 337. The Moie Batard, a square rock of a whitish colour, about 20 feet above high water, lies off the north-western coast of Brecqhou. BLANCHARD ROCK, If miles eastward of Serk, has 7 feet over it at low water, ordinary springs, but only 3 feet at the lowest tides. From it, the Conchee rock on with the Convache, a remarkable cavity northward of the Coupee, bears W. by N. ; and, the high water point of Bee du Nez touching the southern overhanging part of the Gorge, a rock at the south-western end of the Petite Moie, N.W.JN.

Chateau point on with the Conchee W.N.W. leads southward of the Blanchard ; the Corbiere rock off the south-western point of Jersey touching the land about cape Grosnez S. by W. leads a mile eastward ; and, the northern bluff land on Herm in sight north eastward of Bee du Nez N.W. \u00a3 W. leads northward. Many rocks lie within the Blanchard and eastward of the Burons, and between them are navigable channels of from 10 to 26 fathoms water ; they are, however, seldom used by any but the island boats, on account of the impetuous whirl of the tide in this neighbourhood. BALEINE BAY, on the south-eastern side of Serk, between the Baleine and Conchee rocks, may be resorted to in winter or summer, as it affords excellent anchorage in from 3 to 7 fathoms, sand, fine gravel, and broken shells, and good shelter with the wind from N.N.E. round by North to West. Notwithstanding the numerous overfalls and various discoloura tions of water which appear on all sides on approaching this bay, the only shoals are the Tetes de la Conchee, the Gripe, the Vingt Clos, the Balmee, and the Demie de Balmee. The T6tes de la Conchee are the outermost of these, and never have less than 6 fathoms water over any part of them. The Gripe, directly in the fairway of the entrance to the bay, has only 6 feet at low water, springs ; from it the Conchee is on with the Goulet rock N.N.E. \u00a3 E. ; and, the Balmee on with the Pignon bears W. \u00a3 S. The Balmee, which uncovers at a quarter ebb, lies within and westward of the Gripe, with the Baleine in line with the Coupee N. | W., and the western side of the Burons touching the outer or north-eastern part of point Terrible. On this latter line, 150 yards north-eastward from the Balmee, is the Demie de Balmee, a small rock which dries 9 feet at low water. The Vingt ClOS bank, 4 cables southward of the Balmee and extending 3 cables farther in that direction, is also about 3 cables east ward of the Etac de Serk ; it consists of sand and shingle interspersed with rocks ; one head at the northern end of the bank dries 3 feet, and two others southward of it have only 3 feet water over them.

J W. leads in between the Gripe and the Balmee ; in either case, anchor when the western extreme of the Burons comes on with point Terrible. GREVE de la VILLE, on the north-eastern side of Serk, is an anchorage affording good shelter for small vessels during westerly or southerly winds in from 6 to 9 fathoms water, see page 344 ; but, the ground being sand and rock, the anchor is likely to come home unless riding with a long scope of cable. It has also this inconvenience ; should the wind suddenly shift to the northward or north-eastward at low water, the tide running southward for 3 hours after that time, a sailing vessel could not possibly weather the strong in-draught of the Goulet pass, the influence of which is per ceptible half a mile north-eastward of it, and she must therefore either ride at anchor until the offing tide slacks, or, if hard pressed, must at least hold on until there is water enough over the neck of the Goulet. Dangers Off Greve de la Ville.\u2014 The Sardriere rock, with 29 feet water, bears East 2\\ cables from the Bee du Nez. The Jolicot rock dries 5 feet S.W. 150 yards from the Sardriere ; and, the Moulinet rock dries 8 feet just eastward of the Bee du Nez, and only 50 yards off-shore. The Jolicot and Moulinet bear East and West from each other, and are 1\\ cables apart ; there is a safe 6-fathoms channel between them, in entering which, from the westward, be careful to have the peak of the Grande Moie well in sight eastward of Banquette point before hauling in. Grande Moie peak on with Banquette point just clears the Moulinet; and, the same peak over the middle of the Pecheresse rock leads over the Jolicot.

The Pavlaison rock, awash at low water, lies N.E. \\ N. 2 cables from the Noire Pierre, which rock, together with the Petite Moie and Grande Moie off the southern side of the Greve de la Ville, were described at page 340. Directions. \u2014 There are two entrances to Greve de la Ville \u2014 one from the northward between the island and Noire Pierre, and a very narrow one from the southward between the island and Grande Moie. The leading mark from the northward is, Noire Pierre on with the Chapelle, a remarkable hollowed rock on the shore, of which the upper part is whitewashed, bearing S.S.W. \\ W. ; or, the Chapelle half a point open eastward of Banquette point S. \\ W. ; between these limits a vessel may also work in. No leading mark can be given for the southern channel to this anchorage between Grande Moie and the island. It never has less than 3 fathoms, but a rock awash at low water lies 50 yards within the Grande Moie, and is connected with it under water ; care must, therefore, be taken to pass nearer to Robert point, which is steep-to, rather than in mid-channel. A cable northward of Robert point also, a dangerous reef extends about 100 yards from the shore ; and, the Demie, a half-tide rock, lies the same distance S.W. from Petite Moie. Anchorage. \u2014 The best anchorage in Greve de la Ville is between Petite Moie and the island, with the eastern extreme of the Burons just open of Robert point ; outside this line the stream runs strongly ; westward of it the stream is scarcely perceptible. There is good anchorage on the north-eastern side of Serk, outside all the rocks, in from 14 to 19 fathoms, fine clean sand, with St. Martin's point, Guernsey, on with the Corbee du Nez, West ; and, the Chapelle rock midway between Noire Pierre and Banquette point, S. by W.

Should the wind chop round to the westward, a vessel at anchor here may even then be able to weather the Bee du Nez, and from thence may push to sea, or haul under the lee of the island. There are several rocks and ledges in the bay, of which the principal are those now to be described. Episseresses rocks, with 13 feet water, bear N.W. \u00a3 W. 2\\ cables from the outer Autelets rock. Between the Episseresses and port du Moulin are several dangerous rocks. The Guillaumez rock, which covers 6 feet at high water, bears E. by N. | N. 3 cables from the Episseresses, and is about half a cable off-shore. The Grune de GouliOt, with 6 feet water, bears N. | E. 2 cables from the eastern end of Brecqhou. The Petite Banquette is a narrow bank of fine sand with a sharp ridgy apex. It is about 2 cables long, North and South, and has 16 feet on the shoalest part, near the middle, from which the Platte Roque, off port du Moulin, bears E. by S. \\ S. 2 cables. In heavy gales from the north-eastward or westward, this bank has been reported to shift a cable or more in one tide. Anchorage. \u2014 The best deep-water berth in Banquette bay is in 9 fathoms, with Givaude rock on with Moie Batard S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. ; Little Serk mill, without arms, on with the western side of Gouliot island ; and, Manor tower and north cliff of port du Moulin in line. GRANDE GREVE is the anchorage on the south-western side of Serk, between Brecqhou and Little Serk. It takes its name from the great beach of fine white sand under the Coupee uniting Serk with Little Serk. The approach to it is much encumbered by rocks, but there is plenty of room notwithstanding, and good shelter from S.S.E., East, and N.E. winds, in from 7 to 11 fathoms, fine sand and shells. It is not prudent, however, for a sailing vessel to remain at anchor here if the wind shifts northward or southward of the See chart, No. 262 a. S'O 11886 Y 2"], [374, "[Chap.

Should a vessel, therefore, be caught by a westerly wind at this anchorage, she should immediately endeavour to get out either to the westward or through the Gouliot pass, which latter may with confidence be taken at half flood. Dangers off the Grande Greve :\u2014 The Hautes Boues are a group of rocks off the north-western side of Little Serk. The outer north-western rock dries 4 feet, and bears N.W. by W. 4 cables from the Moie de la Fontaine, a high rock close in-shore and 60 feet above the high water level ; there is deep water close to the northern and western sides of this north-western rock, but a string of dangerous rocks extend 3^ cables from it in a S.S.W. direction ; there are also numerous rocks within this line to the eastward, of which five heads dry at low water. There is no safe channel for large vessels eastward of the Hautes Boues. The Dents, a rocky mass off the south-western end of Brecqhou, are awash at high water, springs. They are steep-to and safe of approach from the southward. The Baveuse is a large rock N. \u00a7 E. 1| cables from the Moie de la Fontaine. It covers 4 feet at high water and is surrounded by other smaller rocks. From the Baveuse, in the direction of the Gouliot pass, there are several dangerous rocks, of which the Boue de Baie has only 3 feet, and another rock 150 yards northward of it only 2 feet water. From the Boue de Baie, the Baveuse bears S.S.W.

The best anchorage mark is the Pierre au Norman on with the eastern point of Brecqhou, and about two thirds of the Coupee roadway open southward of the south-eastern point of Serk. A good position in the outer part of the bay in about 12 fathoms is, with Serk mill on with Longue point, and the Givaude between Brecqhou and the Dents. It should, however, be observed that as Serk mill will be hidden behind the intervening high land of Longue point before a vessel arrives abreast of the Dents, it is necessary to look out in time for another object in the same line of direction. Tidal streams around Serk. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Serk at the same time as at St. Peter port, viz., at 6h. 37m., and there is about the same rise and fall, see page 319. The direction of the streams in the immediate vicinity of the island is subject to great variety, it being governed by the configuration of the land. On its north-eastern side, there is a space in which an eddy or slack tide exists during the whole of the six hours that the stream is running north-eastward in the Great Russell and Deroute channels ; this expanse of slack water extends about 2 miles from the land, gradually contracting in width as it increases its distance from the shore. The marks for its north-western and south-eastern limits are, the western end of Brecqhou island on with the Corbee du Nez ; and, the Etac de Serk just appearing eastward of the land at Le Creux. The ordinary limit of its distance from the land is attained when Vale mill comes on with the Sardinias rock off the eastern side of Herm. Outside the north-western and south-eastern limits here given, even at the distance of a cable, run the true Russell and Deroute streams. The stream in Baleine bay, in Terrible bay, and in the neighbour hood of the Conchee, Baleine, and Balmee rocks, runs north-eastward 7^ hours and south-westward for only 4^ hours. The first begins an hour after low water by the shore and runs until 2\\ hours ebb, when the south-western stream commences and runs faintly for the remaining 4^ hours, or until an hour after low water again. See chart, No. 262 a."], [376, "[Chap. VII. CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 SERK. 348 The streams on the north-eastern side of Serk, in the Greve de la Ville, and in the neighbourhood of the Grande and Petite Moie rocks, &c, run 8^ hours S. by E. and only 3| hours N. by W. The southern stream commences at 4 hours flood and runs until half an hour after low water, when the northern stream commences and runs faintly for the remaining 3\u00a3 hours, or until 4 hours flood again. The southern stream above mentioned, on the north-eastern side of Serk, and the northern one on the south-eastern side, branch off to the eastward of the Burons, where they meet and unite with the Deroute stream, which sets directly both ways, and runs for equal periods of time on both tides. A curved line drawn from 3 or 4 cables southward of the Etac de Serk through the Grune Noire to the south-eastern limit of the space of slack water before mentioned, on the north-eastern side of the island, divides the irregular streams in-shore from that of the Deroute ; and, this line continued from this spot close round the Bee du Nez towards the Givaude rock, and from thence to within 3 or 4 cables of the Etac de Serk again, divides the regular Russell stream from the irregular streams within it. The stream on the north-western side of Serk begins to run to the southward at the Bee du Nez, and from thence along the land towards Brecqhou island, at three quarters flood ; near Brecqhou, it meets with the stream from the Gouliot pass, which latter, prevailing, carries it with a curve north-westward into the Great Russell, where it unites with the regular stream. The stream begins to run north eastward along the shore of the Moie du Gouliot towards Bee du Nez at three quarters ebb, and so continues until three quarters flood again. On the south-western side of Serk, during the first hour's flood by the shore the stream sets in a south-westerly direction ; during the second hour it changes to the south-eastward. From the third to the sixth hour it runs eastward and north-eastward. During the first hour of the ebb by the shore, the stream sets in a north-easterly direction ; the second hour, it changes to north-westward. From the third to the sixth hour it runs westward and south- westward. The stream in the Gouliot pass runs for equal spaces of time, corresponding to that in the Great Russell, and does not partake of the irregularity of the tides in its vicinity.

CHANNEL ISLANDS ; THE CASQUETS ; BURHOU ISLAND ; ALDERNEY ISLAND ; BANC DE LA SCHOLE ; AND ALDERNEY RACE. VARIATION in 1897, 17\u00b0 10' W. The islands and rocks which occupy so large a portion of the space between ile de Brehat and cape de la Hague extend northward as far as the \"parallel of that cape, where their northern portion forms a chain 9 miles long W. by N. % N. and E. by S. \\ S., and 3 miles wide. This chain is formed by three distinct groups, viz., the Casquets islets and rocks at its western end, the island of Alderney at the eastern end, and Burhou island and its rocks in the centre. They are separated from the coast of France by the Race of Alderney, a channel 8 miles wide, and from the island of Guernsey and its islets by a space about 12 miles wide. CASQUETS ISLETS and ROCKS,* so named, probably, from their remarkable helmet or cap-like appearance, form a group half a mile in length W.N.W. and E.S.E. by from one to 2 cables in width. The largest and highest of the rocks is a mass near the centre of the group from which Alderney old telegraph tower bears S.E. by E. | E. easterly rather more than 6 miles. On this rock stand the lighthouse and two other stone towers ; all three towers were lighthouses until 1877, when the north-western tower was raised to its present height and maintained as the lighthouse, the eastern tower was reduced in height and converted into the fog signal station, and the southern tower reduced in height and made into a store-house. The rocks are 90 feet above high water, and, at low water, all this central mass is connected and extends 3 cables in a W.N.W. and E.S.E. direction, with a width of 1-^ cables at its widest part, abreast of the lighthouse. Eastward from this central mass, for H cables, lie six high rocks detached from each other at low water by narrow gullies * See Admiralty \u00c6art with views : \u2014 Alderney and Casquets.

The entire group is as steep as a wall on the southern and eastern sides, though separated on the latter side by only 2 cables from the Fourquies rocks, which dry 13 feet ; but, on the northern side, between point Colotte and the lighthouse, are two small detached heads which uncover at low water ; they are, however, only 50 yards distant from the central mass. On the western side, rocks, presently described, extend nearly 4 cables, and render that side dangerous of approach. LIGHT. \u2014 From the white lighthouse, 75 feet high, is exhibited, at 120 feet above high water, a group-flashing white light with a half -minute period. It shows three successive flashes of about two seconds duration each, divided by eclipses of about three seconds duration, the third flash being followed by an eclipse of about eighteen seconds. The light is visible 17 miles, and, in thick or foggy weather, its intensity is more than doubled. Fog Signal. \u2014 During thick or foggy weather, a powerful siren at the eastern tower gives three blasts of two seconds duration each, in quick succession, every two minutes. Between the first and second blasts, and also between the second and third, intervals of three seconds occur ; see page 11. Landing. \u2014 The Little Casquet rock, about 150 yards southward of the lighthouse and 53 feet above high water, shelters a landing place for boats on the main rock at an inlet named Petit Havre ; there is also a landing-place on the eastern side of the Little Casquet rock, and another in a rocky bight on the northern side of the main group. The possibility of safe landing at either of these places is com municated to an approaching vessel by the hoisting of a flag on the platform staff between the towers. When landing can be effected at Petit Havre, a blue flag is hoisted ; when at the southern cove on the eastern side of the Little Casquet, St. George's Ensign ; and, when at the northern landing-place in the north-eastern cove, a red fiag. When no flag is shown, landing is not considered to be safe anywhere. See chart, No. 60."], [380, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, ETC. [Chap. VIII. 352 The following are the rocks lying off the western side of the Casquets :\u2014 : Auquiere rock, 150 yards W.N.W. from the western end of the main group, is about 65 yards in diameter and 44 feet above high water. Sunken rocks extend 60 or 70 yards northward, westward, and southward of the Auquiere. There is a boat channel between it and the main group of the Casquets, but it is very narrow, owing to a ledge of sunken rocks extending nearly half way across from the western point of the group, and it is rendered still more dangerous by other rocks to the southward which dry at low water ; it should only be used, therefore, in cases of urgent necessity. Noire Roque and ledge. \u2014 Noire roque or Black rock, lies W. \\ S. 3j cables from the lighthouse, and W.S.W. nearly 2 cables from the Auquiere ; it is about 50 yards in diameter, about 16 feet above high water, and is craggy and unapproachable. Noire roque ledge, with only 8 feet water, lies N.W. \\ W. 1\u00a3 cables from Noire roque. Its position is generally indicated by a strong ripple, and, with any swell, the sea breaks furiously over it. There is also a sunken rock with only 4 feet water midway between Noire roque and the Auquiere ; no vessel, therefore, should attempt to pass between them. Eight-fathoms ledge.\u2014 N.W. by W. \\ W. 7 cables from the Auquiere is a bank of sunken rocks, on which the least water obtained when surveyed was 13 fathoms, but there is said to be as little as 8 fathoms. The bank is from 40 to 50 yards in extent, and rises suddenly from soundings of 25 and 27 fathoms ; although it cannot be touched by vessels even of the deepest draught, it is dangerous, for it causes violent eddies at all times, and during fresh winds the sea breaks on it. Anchorage can be safely attempted only on the south-eastern side of the Casquets, and while the south-western stream is running, and then only by a steam-vessel. The best spot is in 15 fathoms, fine sand ; the north-eastern tower bearing N. by W. W., and Fort Albert, Alderney, on with the Ortac rock seen between the Equet and Fourquie rocks. This position, although only 1\\ cables from the rocks, is quite safe in fine weather when carefully taken up ; it is sheltered See chart, No. 60,"], [381, "Chap. VIlL] 353 DANGERS AROUND THE CASQUETS. from the tide by the Casquet rocks. At 100 yards within it, the depth is 8 fathoms, and at the same distance outside, 23 fathoms. CAUTION. \u2014 The great strength of the tidal stream near these rocks renders an incautious approach to them during foggy weather extremely hazardous ; it is therefore recommended at such times never to run for them with the tide, but either to wait for slack water or until the stream in its usual rotatory changes turns from the desired direction ; or to get to leeward of the rocks in order to approach them against the stream. Should a shoal cast be obtained when running for the Casquets in thick weather, the vessel's head should be immediately turned against the stream ; after which, haul out cautiously into deep water. Fourquie and Equet rocks.\u2014 A bank of pebbles, sand, and broken shells, with from 6 to 10 fathoms water, extends nearly a mile E.S.E. from Colotte point ; the Fourquie, before mentioned, separated by a channel only 2 cables wide from Colotte point, is near the western end of this bank, and the Equet near its eastern end . The Fourquie dries 13 feet and is steep-to except on its eastern side, where there is a detached sunken rock. It bears E.S.E. 5| cables from the lighthouse ; and S.E. by E. 2\\ cables from Colotte point. The Equet is rather a long, straggling, and dangerous rock ; its north-eastern head is the highest and dries 7 feet ; this head bears from Casquets lighthouse E.S.E. easterly l-^ miles. A detached rocky bank with as little as 33 feet lies from 2 to ?>\\ cables eastward of the Equet. There is no safe channel between the Fourquie and Equet rocks, nor is it safe to approach the eastern side of the latter nearer than 5 cables. Whirling eddies, thrown up by the tide rushing over the rugged bottom at these parts, render a vessel involved in them quite unmanageable. The streams set fairly through the channel between the Fourquie and Colotte point, and there are 10 fathoms water over a tolerably even bottom ; a steamer may, therefore, safely pass through in fine weather ; but, near spring tides, with any swell on, it is not prudent to attempt it. South-westward and southward of the Casquets are several extensive banks on which the least known depth is 4 fathoms, but from the overfalls and heavy sea over them in bad weather they are See charts, Nos. 60 and 2,669 a."], [382, "354 CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, ETC.

A description of these banks now follows. CASQUET S.W. BANK.\u2014 The shoalest spot of 4 fathoms on this bank lies S.W. southerly 4^ miles from Casquets lighthouse ; the bank is of fine gravel, sand, and shells, 3| miles long within the 20-fathoms line, in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, and nearly a mile wide. The highest part of the bank is near the middle, close to its western side ; the 10-fathoms line here includes a space just 2 miles long and barely 2^ cables wide, the shoal part of 4 fathoms being half a mile within its south-western end. From it, Alderney old telegraph tower bears East a little northerly ; and, Doyle's column on with the north eastern extreme of Guernsey S.W. by S. Doyle's column on with Vale mill S.S.W. \\ W. leads rather more than a mile westward of the S.W. bank.

S. nearly 1^ miles from Casquets lighthouse, and, from this, it extends due South rather more than 2 miles, after which the tail of the bank turns off to the eastward, the water deepens, and again shoals in joining the south western end of the S.S.E. bank. The S.S.W. bank is 2^ cables wide within the 20-fathoms line ; it has a short ridgy apex with depths of from 12 to 13 fathoms, and 11 fathoms on the shoalest part near the middle. The Casquet S.S.E. bank is If miles long within the 10-fathoms line in a N.E. and S.W. direction, and very narrow ; its south western end, after the water deepens to 18 fathoms, as before explained, turns off westward and unites with the S.S.W. bank. The shoalest water is about a mile in extent ; it has 4^ fathoms at its north-eastern end, and only 4 fathoms at its south-western end, with See charts, Nos. 60 and 2,669 a."], [383, "Chap.

At the north-eastern extreme of the 10-fathoms line, Casquets lighthouse bears N.W. | N. 2| miles, and at the south-western extreme N. f W. 3^ miles. The shoal spots are difficult to pick up, being generally the summits of sharp ridges of sand, and very steep ; the ridges appear to run rather across the bank in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, but in all probability they shift with the turn of the tide. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels should avoid anchoring on the S.S.W. bank, there being at all times a strong rippre over it ; but, on the S.S.E. bank, in fine weather, vessels cruising in the vicinity may find fair anchorage in from 6 to 10 fathoms, with the Ortac rock midway between Renonquet and Verte-tete N.E. and Casquets lighthouse N. by W. | W. Clearing marks. \u2014 To clear the Casquet S.S.E. bank southward of the 10-fathoms line, keep the Etac de la Quoire open half a point southward of the Orbouee rock E. | N. To clear it to the northward, the inner top of the great Coque Lihou touching the northern side of the Coupe rock E. by S. leads 5^ cables northward of the northern shallow spot in 10 fathoms. Verte-tete behind the Ortac N.E. by N. leads clear to the eastward ; and, the western side of Renonquet on with the eastern side of the Ortac rock N.E. \u00a7 E. leads clear to the westward. CASQUET MIDDLE BANK is about midway between the northern parts of the S.S.W. and S.S.E. banks ; it is nearly circular, about 4 cables in diameter, and has from 15 to 20 fathoms water, with gravel and broken shells bottom. The general depth round all the Casquet banks is from 22 to 25 fathoms. POMMIER BANKS, on the western side of the Ortac channel, are two extensive and dangerous groups of sunken rocks, divided by a narrow 12-fathoms channel.

The least known depth on the eastern bank is 5 fathoms, but there may be 2 or 3 feet less. Clearing marks. \u2014 The north-eastern and south-eastern Casquet towers in line S.W. \u00a3 W. lead 7 cables north-westward ; the Noires Putes midway between the Ortac rock and Renonquet S.S.E. \\ E. leads 4 cables eastward of the eastern bank ; and, St. Anne's church steeple on with the Ortac S.E. by E. | E. leads 5 cables south westward of them and 2 cables southward of the Danger rocks ; it is also the best leading mark for entering the Ortac channel between the Pommier banks and Equet rock. Danger rocks, with 21 feet water, lie 7 cables southward of the Pommier banks and E. \\ S. 2 miles from Casquets lighthouse. These rocks are about 110 yards in extent East and West, but there may be a few feet less water on them than that given ; they must therefore be approached with caution. The channel between Danger rocks and the Equet bank has 15 fathoms, and is about 7 cables wide ; it is, therefore, quite safe in fine weather, but in bad weather,-and especially at spring tides, no vessel should attempt it. At such times, neither this nor any of the channels between the Casquets and Ortac should be used, for the entire space is then covered with tremendous overfalls, in which the largest vessels are quite unmanageable ; even during fine weather there are overfalls, but being then confined to the shoalest parts, they serve to mark the positions of the highest rocky heads, and thus rather contribute to the safety of the navigation. Speedy rock, N. \\ W. 4\u00a3 cables from the Verte-tete, marks the northern boundary of the Ortac channel on its eastern side ; the shoalest part known has 33 feet water ; from it, the outer high rock of the Etacs on with the high central rock of Renonquet bears S.S.E. ; and, Fort Albert flagstaff the apparent breadth of the fort open southward of the Great Nannel S.E. by E. \\ E.

There are three high rocks on this reef, of which the Cone rock is the westernmost ; it bears N.N.E. \\ E. 8 cables from the Ortac rock ; and, E. \\ S. 3t; miles from the Casquets lighthouse. It is of sugar-loaf form and about 20 feet above high water ; it is detached from the main reef and is very steep-to on its northern side, but 150 yards westward of it a small pointed rock uncovers 6 feet. The Verte-tete rock, which gives its name to the reef, is 13 feet higher and much larger than Cone rock ; it has two heads ; the south western and highest is flat at the top ; the other, about 50 yards north eastward of it, being lower, smaller, and peaked. A reef, dry at low water, extends nearly a cable eastward of the high head of Verte-tete, and a sunken rock bears E.N.E. about one cable from it ; with the exception of the dangers described, those of the Verte-tete rocks which are always above water, are very steep-to on the northern side. ORTAC ROCK.\u2014 At 3\u00a3 miles E. by S. \u00a3 S. from the Casquets lighthouse is this remarkable, huge, and nearly inaccessible rock ; it is 79 feet above high water, and may be seen in clear weather 9 or 10 miles distant. Its southern side is steep-to, having 8 fathoms within half a cable of the rock ; but a sunken ledge, with only 11 feet at its outer edge, extends If cables N.W. by W. from the rock, and, from it, Clonque fort is just in sight southward of the Ortac. From the highest part of a ledge with 14 feet water, 150 yards south-west ward of the Ortac, Fort Albert flagstaff is just in sight southward of the Ortac rock. To pass westward of these ledges when coming from the southward, keep Fort Albert flagstaff well open southward of the Ortac until Verte-tete bears N.E. by E. Between Ortac, Verte-tete, and Burhou island, are scattered many dangerous sunken rocks and ledges, near and amongst which the streams run with great velocity. ORTAC CHANNEL is bounded on its eastern side by the Ortac rock and ledge, just described, and by the rocks extending from Renonquet and Verte-tete, with the Speedy rock as its northern and eastern boundary ; and, on its western side, by the eastern Pommier bank, Danger rocks, and the Equet reef, already described.

Vessels may pass on either side of the Dasher rock, but the eastern side is best. The northern entrance of the Ortac channel, between the eastern Pommier bank and Speedy rock, is more than a mile wide ; its narrowest part, eastward of the Dasher rock, is about 7 cables wide. Depths. \u2014 The general depth in this channel, with the exception of the Dasher rock, of 6| fathoms, is about 15 fathoms, with tolerably regular soundings, but the bottom is rocky and foul throughout ; anchoring, therefore, except when unavoidable, is not to be thought of. Directions. \u2014 To pass through the Ortac channel from the north ward, bring the Ortac rock to bear S. J E. and steer direct for it on this bearing ; and, when the Great Nannel comes on with the Verte tete E. by S. | S., steer S.S.W. \\ W., which course leads through the channel about 2| cables westward of the outer part of the Ortac ledge. When the Great Nannel is nearly on with the northern part of the highest head of Renonquet, a vessel is abreast of the Dasher rock, southward of which the deep-water channel is nearly 2 miles wide. When bordering on the northern side of the Ortac rock, the ledge off it may be cleared by not bringing the Great Nannel nearer to Burhou reef than the middle of the water gap or channel between it and Renonquet ; when Fort Albert is open south ward of the Ortac rock, a vessel is southward of the Ortac ledge ; and, when Noir Houmet, a high rock on the southern side of Burhou island, opens southward of the Ortac, she is clear of the Equet and of all danger to the southward. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the Casquets and at the Ortac rock at 6h. 45m. ; equinoctial springs rise 24 feet, ordinary springs 15^ feet, and neaps 10 feet. Tidal Streams. \u2014 Although the tidal stream in the immediate neighbourhood of the Casquets preserves the rotatory character so frequently alluded to, it varies much in strength and direction, according to position. On their northern side and to the eastward, for instance, when outside the influence of the Ortac channel, the slack and change of stream takes place as in the offing, the great body of the flood setting E. by N. and the ebb W. by S. ; but, westward of the Casquets, the strength of the stream is principally felt in three See chart, No. 60."], [387, "Chap. VIII.] ORTAC CHANNEL. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. 359 different directions, viz. : \u2014 at 2\\ hours flood by the shore, South 3-7 knots ; at one hour ebb, E.N.E. 3-0 knots ; and, an hour before low water, W. by N. 3-l knots ; between these points, a continuous stream sets westward, southward, and eastward, the only slack occurring between 3 and 4 hours ebb. On the south-western side of the Casquets, between half ebb and low water, there is an eddy nearly two miles wide and of considerable strength- Between low water and 2 hours flood, this eddy extends farther eastward and increases in width ; and, for a time, it thus continues but gradually becomes weaker and finally disappears at about half flood. Eddies exist also on the north-eastern side of the Casquets, but their action is exactly the reverse of those on the south western side. In the Casquets channel \u2014 that is, in its immediate draught \u2014 the stream begins to set south-westward exactly at half ebb by the shore, and runs in that direction for 6 hours, or until half flood ; and the contrary is the case with the north-eastern stream, for there is neither high nor low water slack here. In the Ortac channel, the stream runs with great strength, especially near high or low water, at springs, when it attains a velocity of 7 knots or more ; it begins to run north-eastward at half flood, gradually turns more northward after passing the Ortac rock, and sets N.N.E. until it again unites with the stream flowing eastward past the northern side of the Casquets. The south-western stream of this channel, which commences at half ebb, sets right over the Equet and the Fourquies, to avoid which rocks the utmost care must be taken. On the south-western side of the Ortac rock, there is an eddy nearly7 1^ miles in extent between half ebb and one hour's flood, after which, the stream on the southern side of the Ortac gradually inclines westward, setting directly for the Casquets at 2 hours flood, until it runs into the last of the south-western stream in the Casquet channel. There is no eddy of consequence on the north eastern side of the Ortac rock. In the course of the rotatory changes of direction of the streams, they at times set across the Ortac channel, and although their strength then decreases, an incautious pilot might soon be swept amongst dangerous rocks. In fact, it should be understood that the Ortac, as well as all other channels in this vicinity are always iSee chart, No. 60. SO 11886"], [388, "CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 CASQUETS, ALDERNEY, ETC.

BURHOU ISLAND lies East 1^ miles from the Ortac ; it is nearly level towards the middle, though huge rocks crop out near the extremes, and it is fringed with reef. The western part of Burhou is cut off from the main part at high water, the portion thus detached being called Little Burhou. The two islands together are 6 cables long East and West and nearly 2 cables wide, their rocky peaks being about the same height, 87 feet above high water ; they are covered with a light soil, on which grow coarse grasses and a variety of wild flowers. The soil is burrowed in every direction by rabbits, formerly very numerous, but now nearly exterminated by the Alderney fisher men ; their holes are now frequently the breeding places of various kinds of sea birds, and among others, of the stormy petrel, which resorts to these islands during the breeding season. There is a small anchorage on each side of the island, and a refuge for fishermen and shipwrecked mariners on the low saddle near the middle. The landing places are in two small coves near the refuge, one on either side of the island. No fresh water can be obtained except such as may be deposited by rain in the interstices of the rocks. Burhou reef. \u2014 The eastern side of Burhou is clear of danger to within 100 yards of the shore, but a reef extends 5 cables westward of Little Burhou, and the whole of it, with the exception of a few rocky heads, covers at high water ; numerous detached rocks lie along the edge of this reef on both its southern and western sides. There is a 5-fathoms channel between Burhou reef and the rocks extending 4 cables eastward of the Ortac rock, and also a very narrow channel called the Passe de la Maure, northward of Burhou reef, and leading into the Little Swinge ; only the most expert pilots amongst the Alderney fishermen can navigate either of these channels with safety-. Dangers northward of Burhou island.\u2014 The following rocks and ledges lie north-westward, northward, and north-eastward of Burhou island, effectually closing all approach to it from that direction except by one narrow channel between the Maquereaux reef and the Nannels : \u2014 See chart, No. 60."], [389, "Chap.

The highest of this group is 43 feet above high water and about 3 cables south-eastward of the high head of Verte-tete, in line between it and the peak of Little Burhou. White rock is 2^ cables eastward of the highest Renonquet ; it is small, 20 feet above high water, steep-to, and safe of approach on its northern side. Only one other rock eastward of this, near the Renonquet group, is visible at high water ; this is a small head 10 or 12 feet above high water, one of a large field of drying rocks, S.E. by E. i E. 1\u00a3 cables from White rock. The White rock eastward, the Verte-tete westward, and the Renonquet rock in the middle, form a remarkable group for recogni tion by the mariner set in here during foggy weather. Maquereaux rocks, a sunken reef, 2 cables in extent North and South and a cable wide, is 5 cables eastward of the White rock ; three heads neai the middle of the reef have only 4 feet water, and there is no safe channel through the chain of rocks between the Maquereaux and Verte-tete.

The Great Nannel, the highest, is 62 feet above high water, and is near the middle of the south-western part of the reef. The Little Nannel, the next in height, is only 16 feet above high water, and is at the north-western end of the reef, one cable distant from the Great Nannel. Other, but smaller rocks above high water extend 2 cables in an easterly direction from the Great Nannel. The end of the group in this direction is the Pierre de But ; this rock covers near high water. The Boues de But, two sunken rocks having 9 feet over them, lie 70 yards eastward of the Pierre de But. The Cordonnier, a small rock drying 3 feet, lies 1^ cables sonthward of the Great Nannel. The width between Burhou and the Nannels is just 2 cables ; the Equet, a rock near the middle which dries 6 feet at low water, divides the passage into two channels, through which the tide rushes into the Little Swinge with great velocity. The Emproue reef, N.N.E. 3 cables from the Great Nannel, is 1^ cables long East and West by 150 yards wide ; it has four rocks which uncover, the highest only 2 feet, and other rocks awash.

There are several dangerous rocks, presently described, in the Swinge, and there is much broken water, even in the calmest weather, caused by the rapidity of the stream over the rugged bottom. There are also two overfalls, caused solely by the tide, of which the danger is much increased in bad weather. During easterly winds, on the north-eastern stream, overfalls extend nearly across from Burhou island to the outer end of Alderney breakwater. With westerly winds, on the south-western stream, they extend from the Ortac rock to the Etacs. Both may- be avoided by following the directions hereafter given. See pages 366, 367. DANGERS in the SWINGE.\u2014 Approaching the Swinge from the south-westward, besides the Ortac rock and other dangers already described on the northern side, are also the Boues des Kaines and North rock, with other rocks in-shore of them adjacent to Burhou island ; near the centre of the entrance is the Pierre au Vraic, with Richards and Ellis rocks to the eastward ; aud, on the southern side of the channel, bordering the coast of Alderney, are the Etacs banks, South rock, and the Barsier and Corbet rocks, before mentioned as being at the narrowest part of the Swinge, besides many other rocks and ledges closer in-shore.

If miles ; and, the outer and highest Etac E. | N. If miles. In form and size this rock is like a small boat bottom up, and it is surrounded by deep water ; at 1^ cables both southward and westward of it there are 26 fathoms, and within that distance, as also in-shore of it, from 14 to 16 fathoms. The marks for the Pierre au Vraic are, the inner peak of Coque Lihou on with the Coupe rock E. by S. ; and, the conical beacon on the slope of the high land just within Fort Tourgis on with the beacon in Clonque fort E. by N. \\ N. ; these marks are also used to clear the rock on either side. Tourgis beacon on with the northern end of Clonque fort leads 2 cables northward of the Pierre au Vraic. By night, Cape de la Hague light opening and shutting in with the southern end of Alderney also leads close northward of it. Richards and Ellis rocks are on a rocky bank about 5 cables south-eastward of the Pierre au Vraic. Richards rock has 5^ fathoms water, and there are 23 fathoms within a cable southward of it ; from the rock, the outer Coque Lihou a little open northward of the inner Noire Pute bears E. \u00a3 S. ; and, the Great Nannel just within the outer eastern high rock on Burhou N.N.E. f E.

Both of these heads may have less water than is here given ; in approaching them from the westward, it is useful to remember that you cannot pass over the western head so long as the highest Noire Pute is in sight westward of the Etacs ; and, proceeding eastward, you are clear of the eastern head when the whole of the highest Noire Pute is eastward of the inner rock of the Etacs. Barsier reef is a dangerous rocky group northward of the Clonque rock, from which it bears N. by W. 4 cables.

The eastern head of the highest Barsier bears -S.W. by W. 2 cables from the Corbet rock ; the western head of the reef is on the same bearing 150 yards from its eastern head. The eastern head of the outer Noire Pute on with the western end of Alderney S. \u00a3 W., clears the western side of the Barsier reef by half a cable ; and, Fort Albert flagstaff on with the flagstaff of Grosnez fort leads clear of its northern side about the same distance, but directly over the reef in-shore of the Corbet rock. Corbet rock is N. by E. 5 cables from Clonque fort, and the same distance N.W. by W. \\ W. from Tourgis point ; it is never wholly covered, though at very high springs it is awash. There is a small detached rock outside the Corbet which dries at low water ; it is 40 yards distant, with the Corbet rock and Tourgis fort in line. The Corbet is attached to Alderney by a dangerous low- water ledge of rocks, and both tidal streams run over this ledge with great rapidity. The long western mark for the Corbet is, the north-eastern Casquets tower a little open southward of the Ortac rock W. by N. \\ N. ; and, the southern extreme of the Casquets just shut in with the southern side of the Ortac leads northward of the Corbet and through the narrows of the Swinge. Between the Corbet and the eastern end of Burhou, the streams rush with great velocity, and during a weather tide the sea breaks nearly across the Swinge ; the smoothest water then is generally near the Corbet. Other rocks and shoals nearer in-shore off the north-western and northern coasts of Alderney are fully described at page K74.

DIRECTIONS.\u2014 From the Southward through the Swinge. \u2014 Steer for the south-western end of Alderney, and, on approaching the Pierre au Vraic, be careful to open Tourgis beacon northward of Clonque fort, in order to pass northward of it ; or, to pass inside and southward of the Pierre au Vraic, bring Clonque fort on with the western end of the Etacs until the Great Nannel just within the eastern end of Burhou bears N.N.E. J E., which marks lead eastward of Richards rock and outside the Etacs bank and the Boues des Etacs ; proceed with the latter leading mark until Fort Albert flagstaff is on with the flagstaff in Grosnez fort ; the vessel is then northward of the South rock and of Barsier reef, and may pass the Corbet rock at the distance of a cable if desired. After passing the Corbet, a course maybe shaped out into the English Channel or for Alderney harbour, bearing in mind, in the latter case, that more than one third of the breakwater at its outer end having been washed away, its remains form a dangerous submerged reef, see page 370, for which a good clearing mark is, the Ortac rock seen between Noir Houmet and Burhou island ; the chief dangers south ward of this line are the Jumelles rocks, described at page 375. Large ships should pass westward of the Pierre au Vraic and up through the middle of the Swinge, on the western side of the South rock bank and 1\\ or 2 cables northward of Corbet rock, along which route nothing less than 8 fathoms will be met with, clearing the outlying rocks in passing by the marks given in describing those dangers. By Night, it is useful to remember that the Casquets light is masked by the Ortac rock when bearing W. by N. h N. ; the line of eclipse on the southern side of the Ortac passes nearly a cable north ward of the Corbet rock ; the Casquets light is seen again on the northern side of the Ortac at the distance of 1\u00a3 cables northward of the Corbet rock. THE TIDAL STREAM must be carefully considered and allowed for in navigating the Swinge. The first of the east-going stream sets on Alderney, but, after high water, it turns off to the northward and north-westward. Therefore, entering the Swinge from the southward, it is advisable under ordinary circumstances to pass westward of the Pierre au Vraic on the first of this stream, and, eastward of it at the latter part ; in thick weather, however, the See chart, No. 60."], [395, "Chap. VIII.] SWINGE CHANNEL.-DIRECTIONS.-TIDAL STREAMS. 367 Alderney shore should be closed with, but cautiously at all times, and the vessel anchored on or near the Orbouee bank or in the West bay anchorage until clear enough to proceed, see page 381. No vessel should attempt to pass through the Swinge with the tide in foggy weather, for, at springs, the stream runs from 7 to 8 knots, and under such circumstances it is evident that, should a vessel come suddenly into danger, her destruction would be inevitable. The strength of the stream in the Swinge \u2014 that is, between Burhou island and the Corbet rock- sets straight through both ways at high and low water ; like the stream in the Casquet channel, it begins to set westward at half ebb exactly, and runs in that direction for 6 hours, or until half flood ; and, the contrary is the case with the east-going stream. Westward of the Narrows, a branch of the east going stream sets through between Burhou island and the Ortac rock, especially after high water by the shore ; and, eastward of the Narrows, it curves round the Emproue to the northward and north westward, where both branches uniting with the Casquets channel stream, and ultimately with that of the English channel, again set eastward. The last two hours of the west-going stream in the Swinge gradually veers towards the South as it recedes from the draught of the Swinge passage. The average velocity of the east-going stream during springs is 1\\ knots ; that of the west-going stream, 65 knots. When passing through the Swinge from the northward, on the first of the west-going stream, proceed along the Alderney shore, past the Etacs, and eastward of the Pierre au Vraic. After low water, keep Burhou island and the Ortac rock aboard, taking care to clear the North rock and Boues des Kaines, and making due allowance for the set of the south-eastern stream, which will be met with after clearing the Casquet banks. In westerly gales, it is particularly necessary to take the above prescribed routes to avoid the overfalls, which shift their positions through a regular course according to the direction of the stream. At such times, the Swinge is only navigable by steam-vessels of large size and power, and even then at some risk. Vessels from the northward and eastward, as well as those from Alderney, bound to Guernsey or Jersey during westerly gales, should endeavour to push through the Race or Swinge channels directly the east-going stream begins to slack, the sea being then comparatively smooth ; for, as the west-going stream makes against the gale, so does See chart, No. 60."], [396, "368 [Chap. VIII. CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 ALDERNEY. the sea rise and become dangerous ; and, as during the strength of this stream both the Race and Swinge channels are covered with broken water and highly dangerous, it is recommended at such times that vessels anchor in Alderney harbour, and there wait for a tide or for a lull in the gale. ALDERNEY or AURIGNY ISLAND is 3-J miles long, East and West, by 1\u00a3 miles wide at the widest past, near the western end, and has an area of 1,962 acres, of which about one-third is Crown property. The Rond But, near the western end, is about 288 feet above high water, and is the highest part of the island, though the hill on which the windmill stands, half a mile west ward of it, is nearly the same height, and at the old telegraph tower the land is only 10 feet lower. Alderney may be seen in clear weather 22 miles distant ; its eastern extreme bears W. by N. \\ N. 8 miles from Cape de la Hague lighthouse ; and, E. by S. \\ S. 8Jy miles from the Casquets. The appearance of the island from a distance is wild and gloomy, nor does it improve on a nearer view The southern and western coasts are high precipitous cliffs, intersected by narrow valleys and fronted by outlying rocks, among which the most conspicuous are the Coque Lihou and Noire Putes groups to the southward, and the Etacs and Clonques to the westward ; the latter are crowned by a fort, which commands the Swinge channel. The northern and eastern sides are not nearly so high, and the coast consists of a series of bays of sand and gravel separated from each other by steep projecting points ; but, with the exception of Plate Saline bay, the intervals of beach are inaccessible, on account of outlying rocks. The heights along the southern and western coasts are covered with heath and furze, but the interior is generally cultivated and fertile. There are but few trees on the island, and these only in the valleys near the town, where the neighbouring hills afford some shelter. St. Anne, the town of Alderney, is near the middle of the island ; it is well built, paved, and lighted with gas ; it has several chapels and the handsome parish church of St. Anne's, the whole island forming one parish under the patronage of the Crown. During the progress of the breakwater and forts, villages sprang up at Craby, Braye, and Mannez, for the convenience of those engaged on the works. See chart, No. 60."], [397, "369 Chap. VIII.] GENERAL DESCRIPTION. \u2014 APPROACH. Alderney has no dock accommodation nor any facilities for the repairs of shipping or for coaling steamers. Its trade is represented by about 200 small vessels entering the port during the year, of an aggregate tonnage of about 20,000 tons, besides which a few passing vessels take refuge under its breakwater. The island abounds with springs of excellent water. Fuel is imported from England, and cattle for slaughter from Cherbourg ; these necessaries are neverthe less to be obtained almost at the same prices as at Guernsey, owing to the regular steam communication now existing between Alderney, Cherbourg, and Guernsey. Until the building of the breakwater, Alderney possessed but two small insecure harbours, both of which dry at low water neaps, viz., Longy bay or Baie du Catel, on the south-eastern side of the island, and the old artificial harbour of Braye on the northern side. Alderney forms part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and is included in the military command of the Lieutenant-Governor of that island. The Civil Government or States consists of a judge appointed by the Crown, six jurats, and twelve douzeniers, who are elected by the inhabitants. The island is in telegraphic communication with Jersey by cable from its south-western end, and thus with England and France. In 1891, the population was 1,843, a decrease of 205 in the decennial period. The ordinary garrison consists of a battery of Royal Artillery, besides the island militia, who are organized as artillery and reported to be very efficient. The forts along the northern, eastern, and south-eastern shores of Alderney form a great feature in the appear ance of the island on those sides ; of them, Fort Albert is the most conspicuous, standing on the crown of a remarkable conical hill which rises from the comparatively low land at the north-eastern part of the island. The Approach to Alderney on every side but from the north eastward, is dangerous from the numerous outlying rocks ; and, the dangers of the navigation are greatly intensified by the strength of the tidal streams ; therefore, a stranger should close with the island only on its north-eastern side, from which direction Alderney harbour may be approached and entered by attending carefully to the direc\" tions given. ALDERNEY HARBOUR, on the northern shore of Alderney, as originally formed by the breakwater, enclosed the old harbour of Braye, as well as the anchorage in the road fronting it, and also the See chart, No. 60."], [398, "370 [Chap. VIII. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 ALDERNEY. harbour of Craby, which latter was built chiefly to shelter the vessels employed in the construction of the breakwater and other Govern ment works. The rocks encumbering the harbour were removed to clear the anchorage ; but, on account of the rocky nature of the bottom, vessels using their own anchors should ride with a good scope of cable when there is much wind. The value of the harbour as a refuge is much impaired by the partial destruction of the break water which has taken place, and it cannot in its present condition be considered as affording safe anchorage to large vessels or even cruizers in all weathers.* A LLOYD'S SIGNAL STATION is established on Bute's hill at the head of the harbour, with which vessels can communicate by International code. At this, as at all Lloyd's stations, two balls horizontal signifies, \" Station temporarily closed, no communication can be held.\" Three balls in the form of a triangle signifies, \" Telegraphic communication interrupted, messages will be for warded by other means as soon as possible.\" The BREAKWATER was commenced in 1847 and completed in 1870 ; as constructed, it extended from Grosnez point straight for 1,000 yards N. 74\u00b0 E., when it curved northward for 173 yards, with a radius of 500 yards, and from thence straight to the end N. 54\u00b0 E. for a further distance of 436 yards. It was built on an artificial bank of rubble stone, the main part being 40 feet wide, and 6 feet above high water, springs. Unfortunately', its strength proved unequal to the requirements of the position, and its partial destruc tion, commenced during a violent gale from the eastward on the night of 8th January 1879, went on until by May 1887, the whole of the outer part, for an extent of 642 yards, had disappeared, leaving the inner part standing for a distance of 967 yards from fort Grosnez ; the present visible end above water has been faced up and repaired, and terminates so abruptly as to be easily mistaken by a stranger, unaware of the destruction that has taken place, for the former finished end, and thus might prove a great danger should the clear ing marks not be made out, or be carelessly disregarded. The sub merged portion forms a reef visible in parts at low water, of which the most conspicuous portion is aboui 1,300 yards from fort Grosnez, or about 330 yards from the present outer end. At the inner end of the breakwater there is a slipway for boats and small vessels, with steps at the lower end descending to the level of low water, springs ; there is also a flight of landing steps * See Admiralty plan :\u2014 Alderney harbour, No. 2,845 ; scale, m = 18 inches."], [399, "Chap. VIII.J HARBOUR. \u2014 BREAKWATER. \u2014 LIGHTS. 371 on the inner side 930 yards from the shore, and therefore close to its present outer end. The inner side of the breakwater is provided at short intervals with iron ladders from low water to the quay level. Moorings. \u2014 One set of 1st class moorings is laid down under shelter of the breakwater, less than 1^ cables from the existing outer end, and as these moorings are not inspected annually they should be used with caution. Depths. \u2014 As before remarked, the rocks inside the Breakwater were for the most part removed by blasting ; of these, the Tetes Champignons N.W. by W. 150 yards from Roselle point have 16 feet water over them. Another group W. by S. 2 cables from Roselle point have 12 feet, and, at the position of a former half tide rock there are 22 feet water. A vessel at the Admiralty moorings will swing in 25 feet least water. Westward of this the water quickly shoals ; north-eastward of it the water deepens, but the shelter becomes very indifferent. The Aiguillons rocks are eastward of those removed by blast ing. They consist of a group of eight heads which dry at low water ; the Great Aiguillon, the easternmost rock, is N.N.E. \\ E. 1\\ cables from Bibette head. The Small Aiguillon is the outer or northernmost of the group and bears due West about 90 yards from the Great Aiguillon. A dangerous reef of sunken rocks, with from 16 to 6 feet water, extends about 140 yards northward and eastward of the Great Aiguillon ; it may be cleared on the western side by keeping the flagstaff in Fort Albert open westward of the Small Aiguillon when that rock is uncovered ; and, the same rock on with the Outer Grois rock E. by N. \\ N. northerly leads clear of a 16-feet rock off Bibette head. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed red lights are exhibited at the head of the harbour to mark the fairway channel by night ; the lower light is visible 5 miles, and is exhibited only on a line through the middle of the fairway ; this light is shown from a white tower on the para pet of the old pier at Braye and is 25 feet above high water, springs. The upper light is exhibited from a pillar on the site of the old lecture room S.W. \\ W. 370 yards from the lower light ; it is 55 feet above high water, and visible 9 miles. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Alderney harbour at 6 h. 46 m. ; mean springs rise 17^ feet ; neaps, 12| feet ; neaps range 8 feet.- See plan, No. 2,845."], [400, "372 [Chap. VIII. CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 ALDERNEY. Braye Harbour, within Alderney harbour, is formed by a, sheltering pier projecting in an easterly direction .from the western side of Braye bay ; it dries at low water, neaps, and is very inferior to the little harbour of Craby. The best time to enter Braye harbour is on a rising tide between half flood and high water ; at low water, ordinary springs, there are from 6 to 8 feet water between the iron beacons placed one on either side of the entrance on the two rocky masses just outside the pier head. The western beacon has a circular eye on the top ; the eastern one, a cross. No leading mark is required, but the pier-head should be rounded as closely as possible. Craby harbour, also within Alderney harbour, was constructed by the Government in 1850, in the creek between Braye harbour and Grosnez point. In addition to the shelter of the breakwater, this harbour is protected by two small piers having an entrance between the pier-heads 40 feet wide and open to the North-east. This harbour is 100 yards long from West to East, and 90 yards wide ; it affords 230 yards of quay frontage, sufficient to berth four colliers of about 150 tons burthen ; it dries out to the pier-heads at low water, springs, and at half tide there are 9 feet between the pier-heads. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 From the north-eastward, in hazy weather, it is prudent to obtain a bearing of cape de la Hague, when a vessel may stand boldly for the north-eastern end of the island ; but, to avoid the outlying rocks, should the weather be so thick that land cannot be discerned at the distance of 2 miles, neither the cape nor the island should be approached within that distance. When nearing either the cape or the island, the tides must be care fully considered, especially during the south-western stream, as it sets strongly over the Blanchard and Brinchetaie ledge ; and, it may be useful to note that on nearing the eastern end of Alderney, the great Coque Lihou rock open south-eastward of the island keeps a vessel in the stream of the Race, and the Casquets light open north ward of Burhou island keeps her in the Swinge or Channel stream. See also page 388 for approaching the harbour entrance when coming from the south-westward round the eastern end of the island. In clear weather, a vessel may stand direct for the island. The leading mark into the harbour can then be seen 5 or 6 miles distant ; it is, the tower of St. Anne's church on with the pier-head -Seel plan, No. 2,845."], [401, "373 Chap. VIIL] HARBOUR. \u2014 DIRECTIONS.\u2014 CAUTION. of Braye harbour -S.W. \u00a3 W. ; and, to clear the outer end of the submerged portion of the breakwater, vessels from the northward or westward rounding the breakwater must be careful to keep the beacon on King's battery wall well open eastward of the Hornet des Pies beacon until the leading mark for the harbour comes on. CAUTION. \u2014 It is- necessary to repeat, and the special attention of the mariner is drawn to the fact, that the present visible end of the breakwater terminates so abruptly as to resemble the original finished end. Vessels unaware of the destruction of the outer end of the breakwater, and rounding it without paying strict attention to the marks and directions given, run the risk of almost certain destruction on the submerged portion, which extends 642 yards beyond the present visible end. The strength of the west-going stream, especially at springs, also sets directly on the submerged end for about 9 hours out of 12, which is an additional reason for the closest attention being given to the leading marks. It need scarcely be added that a vessel should be always ready for anchoring promptly in case of necessity. .See also Tidal streams, page 383. When the eastern stream is running, the submerged end of the breakwater may be safely passed by keeping the beacon on King's battery wall on with the beacon on Hornet des Pies. By night, on account of the strength of the tides in this neigh bourhood, no vessel should enter unless in charge of a pilot or of some person with good local knowledge. The leading mark is, the harbour red lights in line bearing S.W. f W. ; run in on this line, making careful allowance for the set of the tidal stream across the entrance. From the northward and westward, do not bring the Casquets light northward of West until the harbour lights are in line. and, on approaching the harbour, be very particular to have them exactly in line before shutting in the Casquets light with Burhou island, when a vessel will be close up to the submerged end of the breakwater. Near high or low water, springs, the stream sets across the entrance of the harbour with great velocity, and great caution is then necessary in entering. To ensure avoiding the rocky patches outside the Aiguillons on the one side, and the toe of the breakwater on the other, the bearing of the upper light should on no account be altered more than a quarter of a point on either side, and the lower light never lost sight of.

DANGERS N.W. and NORTH of ALDERNEY.\u2014 The outer dangers along this shore have been included in the description of the Swinge channel, see page 364, &c. ; those nearer the shore are the following : \u2014 The Etacs, the most remarkable of all the rocks near the western end of the island, with their off-lying shoals, form the southern boundary of the Swinge channel. They consist of a group of four ; the highest is 128 feet above high water ; the centre of the group is 2 cables from the shore off the western end of Alderney. The Boues des Etacs extend W.N.W. If cables from the outer Etac ; their north-western head has only one foot water. The eastern end of the outer Noire Pute on with the western end of the Coupe leads 100 yards westward of them ; and, the northern or low part of Tourgis fort on with the southern part of Clonque fort leads the same distance northward. The Clonques are three high rocks attached to the western shore of Alderney by a rocky ridge uncovered at low water ; on this ridge, there has been constructed a roadway to communicate with Clonque fort, which fort stands on the two rocks nearest the land. A wooden beacon stands in the rear of the fort, on the south-eastern head of the Clonque. Platte Boue, Founiais, and Ozard rock, are off the Clonques on about a W. \\ S. line of bearing from the fort ; the Platte Boue is close to the main reef ; the Founiais, which dries 6 feet, nearly 2 cables from the fort ; and, Ozard rock, on which there are 4 feet water, nearly 3 cables from it. Ozard rock is very small ; from it, the western end of the highest Noire Pute just open eastward and clear of the inner rock of the Etacs bears S. f E. easterly ; and, Tourgis beacon is on with the northern tangent of Clonque fort. Queruelles rocks. \u2014 The outer edge of this reef bears N.N.W. \\ W. 2\\ cables from Clonque fort, and is 1^ cables southward of the Barsier reef, already described, with from 4 to 8 fathoms water between them.

OF ALDERNEY. 375 Caution. \u2014 There is no safe passage inside the Queruelles and Barsier reefs, even for boats, and the first of the flood sets right on them ; at this time, therefore, a wide berth should be given them in passing. The Grosse rock, large and prominent, 14 feet above high water, springs, and steep-to, may be approached within half a cable. It lies E. \\ S. 4 cables from the Corbet ; and, North 2 cables from Tourgis point. The Jumelles are two small ridges of rock which uncover at half tide East 1\\ cables from the Corbet, and 3 cables from the shore of Plate Saline bay. Braye rocks are a group of four heads, ot which the outermost seldom covers though awash at high water, springs ; the three others, named the Follets, show at half tide. The outer Braye lies N.E. \\ E. 2| cables from the outer angle of Grosnez fort and a cable from the breakwater. A rock with only 3| feet water lies E.N.E. 65 yards from the outer Braye. DANGERS N.E. OF ALDERNEY.\u2014 The principal dangers on the north-eastern side of Alderney besides the sunken rocks north-eastward of the Aiguillons, included in the description of Alderney harbour, see page 371, are the Grois, the Platte, the Ledge, and the Sauquet. Grois ledge is an extensive and dangerous reef off Etoc point ; it extends 2\\ cables between the bearings N. by E. and N.E. from the tower of the Chateau de l'Etoc on that point, which fort should not be approached on these bearings within 5 cables. The Outer Grois, a peaked rock, and the highest of the reef, is awash at high water, springs, and bears N. by E. \\ E. 2\\ cables from the flagstaff of the fort. Several heads show at half tide, and many more at low water. The stream rushes over this reef with great velocity. The depth is 13 feet at l-\\ cables W.N.W. of the Outer Grois ; and the Boues briees, awash at low water, are 1\\ cables eastward of that rock. The Ortac rock and Noir Houmet in line and well open of the breakwater W. N. leads 100 yards northward of these ledges ; and Bon-Ami, the high rock on the eastern side of Corblets bay, on with the look-out tower above the Mannez quarries S. | E. leads 100 yards eastward of the Boues briees.

The ground between the Platte and the outer extreme of the Grois reefs is foul and should not be approached by any vessel. The Ledge, or Fosse de la Bande, is a reef of considerable extent, with 13 feet water. It bears E. \u00a7 S. 6^ cables from the Outer Grois rock, with that rock and the Ortac in line ; and, the brick kilns, eastward of St. Anne, on with the north-western tangent of Corblets fort S.W. by W. westerly.

Sauquet rock, 2 cables southward of the Ledge and H cables north-eastward of Homeaux Florains reef, on which is a small fort, uncovers 3 feet at low water, springs, with the tower of the Chateau de l'Etoc on with the Ortac rock. Great Nannel on with the Outer Grois rock W. by N. | N. leads just northward of it ; and the north eastern point of Burhou island in line with the Outer Grois leads between the Ledge and the Sauquet. Tidal Stream. \u2014 The south-western stream running down towards Alderney divides in the vicinity of the Sauquet rock, one part running through the Race of Alderney, the other through the Swinge; its tendency is to throw vessels near the Sauquet rock right on it. A berth should therefore be given it of 3 or 4 cables. DANGERS E. and S.E. of ALDERNEY\u2014 The principal dangers off the eastern side of the island are the Brinchetaie ledge, the Boufresses, and the Blanchard ; and, south-eastward of port Longy, the Race and Inner Race rocks and other rocky patches. The Brinchetaie is a dangerous group of rocks forming a ledge extending south-eastward from Houmet Herbe, off the eastern point of Alderney. The outer tidal rock is 3 cables from the shore and uncovers 11 feet ; the inner rock uncovers 16 feet.

Between its western end and the rocks nearer the shore off the eastern end of the island, there are from 9 to 12 fathoms water. The Blanchard is very dangerous, especially at its eastern extreme, which rises quite suddenly from depths of 20 and 25 fathoms, causing, during springs, eddies and a heavy sea on a weather tide. .- Race and Inner Race rocks. \u2014 Three unconnected rocky patches lie south-eastward of Longy bay, stretching off from the tails of the Brinchetaie and Blanchard at the several distances of 4\u00a3 cables. 9 cables, and 1 \\ miles from the latter. On the Race and Inner Race rocks, the two outermost, there are only 18 feet water, and 4^ fathoms on the patch nearest the Blanchard, which bears no special name.

SOUTH COAST OF ALDERNEY. \u2014 Longy bay, or Baie du Catel, is on the south-eastern side of Alderney ; it has only about 12 feet in it at high water, springs, and dries at low water, neaps ; it affords but little shelter and is seldom used. The entrance is between Raz island, on which there is a fort, and the Queslingue rock. The distance between these points is less than 2 cables, and this small space is divided into two entrances of equal width by a rock in the centre, which dries 2 feet ; moreover, both tidal streams set with great strength across the entrance, therefore no stranger should attempt to enter unless compelled to do so, when the following directions should be observed. Directions. \u2014 The most favourable winds for entering Longy bay are those between N.W. and S.W., and the best time is between 2 and 5 hours ebb ; a vessel may then run aground, and on the succeed ing tide she may be hauled up under Essex nunnery on the sandy beach at the western side of the bay. The leading mark in with these winds is, the Nunnery just shut in by the land westward of Queslingue rock N. \u00a3 E. until near the rock ; then, by rounding its rocky point within half a cable, the fairway sunken rock in the entrance is avoided. Anchorage. \u2014 Off Longy bay, anchorage at 1^ cables off-shore, affording shelter from northerly and north-westerly winds, may be found in 9 fathoms, sand, gravel, and shells, with the whole of Fort Albert just shut in with, and seen over, the western point of Longy bay N. by W. | W,; and, the Grande Folie rocky peak just open eastward of Raz island fort N.E. f N. A better anchorage, farther westward and more out of the tide, is in 7 or 8 fathoms off Tchue bay, 1| cables westward of the Rousset rock, with the western side of Raz fort touching the eastern side of Queslingue rock.

The Etac de la Quoire is about 100 yards off-shore near the middle of the southern coast of the island, and is connected with it at low water. It is a conical rock, about 60 yards in diameter and 106 feet above high water, or 10 feet lower than the great Coque Lihou. Bonit rock bears S. by W. \\ W. 4 cables from the Etac de la Quoire. This dangerous rock is of small extent and uncovers only at low water, springs, having from 10 to 14 fathoms close to. The marks for it are, the Grande Folie seen between the Rousset and Queslingue rocks N.E. \\ E. ; and, the Etac de la Quoire on with a beacon on the adjoining shore N. by E. \\ E., the latter mark leading rather on the eastern side of the rock. The Bonit may be avoided by not approaching Alderney nearer than a mile, by keeping the Casquets in sight southward of the island, or by keeping the inner Noire Pute open southward of the outer Coque Lihou.

The great Coque Lihou, the middle and easternmost, is much larger and higher than either of the others, being 116 feet above high water ; it bears S.S.E. \\ E. easterly 6 cables from Alderney old telegraph tower. A bank of sand, extending 2| cables eastward from the great Coque Lihou, has on it as little as 1^ fathoms. It makes a convenient anchorage for fishing-boats and small craft in fine weather.

Here a vessel will lie out of the tide. There is also indifferent anchorage 2 or 3 cables S.S.W. from the Orbouee rock in 7 fathoms, but it is exposed to the full strength of the flood stream. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 The tidal streams round Alderney are subject to changes and variations very similar in character to those round Guernsey and Jersey, but with local peculiarities, arising principally from the more prominent position of Alderney on the edge of the true Channel stream, and also, in a great degree, from the different form of the island itself as compared with the others. At Alderney, as well as round Guernsey, the direction of the tidal stream revolves from East round by North to West and South, See chart, No. 60."], [410, "[Chap. VIII. 382 CHANNEL ISLANDS. \u2014 ALDERNEY. running from every point of the compass during one whole tide of ebb and flood. As at Guernsey, the stream attains its greatest strength about high and low water by the shore, but, as might be expected from the situation of Alderney, its direction at this time is different, coinciding more nearly with the Channel stream. Thus the strength of the stream, flood and ebb, on the northern side of Alderney and the Casquets, runs about E. \\ N. and W. \\ S. ; whilst round the Guernsey group, at the same time, its general direction is about E.N.E. and W.S.W. This change in direction may be considered as taking place on a line passing close northward of the Casquets, past the Nannels, northward of Alderney and of cape de la Hague. A glance at the chart best illustrates how the east-going stream, after passing through the Race, Swinge, and Ortac channels, is deflected a little to the southward of East in uniting with the Channel flood stream ; also how, on the west-going stream, the Channel ebb stream running in a westerly direction past cape de la Hague, Alderney, and the Casquets, is deflected through the channels between these places in a more southerly direction. This description, however, only applies to the periods of high and low water ; in its transition from one to the other direction, peculiarities occur requiring a more particular description. The eastern stream begins to make through the Race and Swinge channels at about the time of half flood by the shore, and it attains its greatest strength, 7 to 8 knots, about the time of high water. An hour after high water, the stream, in the course of its rotatory change of direction, is setting about N.E. by E. and begins to abate in strength, still veering in direction and slacking in strength ; at 3 hours after high water, it sets faintly to the N.W., causing a short slack in the Swinge, and also on the north-western side of Burhou, after which the western stream comes down and rushes through these channels with a velocity nearly as great as the eastern stream. After low water by the shore, the stream begins to veer to the south ward and abate in strength ; an hour and a half after low water, the stream is setting from the northward on Alderney and Burhou, causing extensive slacks or eddies southward of these islands ; and, near half flood, the offing stream, now very weak, sets south-east ward, causing a dead slack for a short time in all the channels between Alderney and the Casquets, followed by the commencement of the eastern stream. Sen chart, No. 60."], [411, "Chap. VIII.] 383 TIDAL STREAMS. Having thus described the general course of the main tidal stream round Alderney, it is necessary to describe some of the most im portant eddies caused by the peculiar turning of the streams and the obstruction offered by islands and rocks. Alderney, the Casquets, and intermediate rocks, all narrow in proportion to their length and each lying on a line of direction nearly East and West, are in the line of both tidal streams when at their strength ; therefore, at these times, the resistance they offer to the free course of the stream is small and the eddies under them insignificant ; but, as the stream in its rotatory change of direction moves out of this line, extensive eddies or in-shore streams are formed under the lee of Alderney, alternately on its northern and southern shores. On the northern shore of Alderney, the in-shore eddy stream commences at the Sauquet rock and extends westward as far as the Corbet rock, and within that rock southward of the main channel of the Swinge as far as the western end of the island, running 9 hours westward and only 3 hours eastward, the western stream commencing an hour before high water and the eastern stream at 2 hours flood. Along the southern side of the island, between Orbouee rock and Raz island, there are 9 hours of eastern and but 3 hours of western in-shore eddy stream ; the eastern stream commences one hour before low water, and runs along the land towards Longy and beyond it during the whole flood and until 2 hours ebb. In the neighbour hood of Longy, meeting with the south-western stream of the Race, it suddenly veers and unites with it ; the western in-shore eddy stream commences at 2 hours ebb and sets towards the Orbouee for 3 hours, or until 5 hours ebb, at which time it joins the south-western stream from the Swinge. The general courses and action of these two great eddies or in shore streams are exactly the reverse of each other. They may be easily understood by reference to a chart of Alderney and by careful perusal of the foregoing remarks ; but, as the northern eddy sets across the entrance of Alderney harbour, at times with great velocity, and then constitutes the principal danger in entering that harbour, a more particular description of its action will now be given. Alderney harbour entrance. \u2014 The direction of the eastern stream half an hour before high water, about which time it attains its greatest strength, is about East ; this being the line of direction of See chart, No. 60."], [412, "384 [Chap. VIII. CHANNEL ISLANDS.\u2014 ALDERNEY. Alderney, it runs full on the western point of the island by which the stream is now fairly divided, one part rushing through the Race along the southern side of the island between 7 and 8 knots, the other through the Swinge at about the same rate, leaving a small eddy previously noticed under the eastern end of the island near the Sauquet rock. At high water by the shore, the turning of the offing stream from an easterly to a northerly direction relieves the pressure of the Swinge stream from the end of the breakwater ; and, at this time, during a spring tide, the Swinge stream is running eastward at the rate of 3 knots 120 yards outside the breakwater, the intermediate space being occupied by the stream setting westward round the breakwater, also at the rate of 3 knots. This latter is the in-shore stream or eddy ; it commences in the eddy near the Sauquet rock, and begins to set westward, as before stated, an hour before high water. At this time, the western stream sets round the end of the breakwater, in volume a mere thread, but it gradually increases in magnitude as the turning of the offing stream removes the pressure of the Swinge stream from the breakwater. The most dangerous time in dealing with this stream and eddy is at about high water, when they set past each other, separated by only a few feet, at the rate just given ; great caution must therefore be used in taking a long vessel into harbour at this time. The break water obstructing the course of the western stream is the cause of the danger, and the stream is, of course, strongest near the outer end of that structure ; therefore, at high water, it is advisable to: enter the harbour a little southward of the mid-channel course rather than risk a too near approach to the breakwater end. An hour after high water, the inner edge of the east-going Swinge stream is removed to the distance of 2 cables from the breakwater end, and both streams beginning to abate in strength, the danger gradually disappears.* At 2 hours ebb, the Swinge stream, now slacking fast and veering westward, sets on the Nannels ; the western stream running past the end of the breakwater at the rate of 3 knots, meeting the eastern stream in the Swinge a little outside the Corbet rock, unites with it and both set towards the Nannels. Within the Corbet rock, the See chart, No. 60. * The destruction of the outer end of the breakwater in some degree modifies the conditions affecting this stream and eddy.

VIII.] TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 BANC DE LA SCHOLE. 385 western stream sets down in-shore as far as the western end of the island. At half ebb by the shore, the offing stream is setting faintly north westward and there is slack water in the Swinge, but only for a few minutes, after which the westerly stream makes through the Swinge and immediately commences to run past the breakwater end with renewed strength until low water by the shore, gradually slacking as the offing stream veers from W. \\ S. to the southward. Whilst the direction of the stream is veering through the latter section of its course, there is slack water at the entrance of Alderney harbour ; after a short interval, at 2 hours after low water, the stream sets across the end of the breakwater in an E.S.E. direction. BANC DE LA SCHOLE, 7 miles S.S.W. from Alderney, lies nearly in the direct line between the Great Russell channel and the Race of Alderney. Like most other banks between the Channel islands, it consists of a mixture of fine gravel, sand, and shells ; it iB very steep-to on the southern and western sides but shoals gradually on the north-eastern side. Within the 5-fathoms line, it is 1\\ miles long N. by E. and S. by W. and about 3 cables wide near the middle, tapering off to a mere ridge at the ends. The 10-fathoms line includes a space 2\\ miles long N.N.E. and S.S.W. and 8 cables wide, whilst the 20-fathoms line includes a length of 5 miles by 1^ miles. The top of the bank is very narrow and consists of small semi-circular ridges of sand convex to the S.W., over which the general depth is 3 fathoms at the lowest spring tides ; near the middle of the bank, however, as little as 2 fathoms has been found, with some spots close by of 2\\ fathoms. The soundings taken on this bank at different times tend to show that its higher parts are continually varying in depth ; it is probable, therefore, that, within a limited space, it also shifts its position under the influence of tide, weather, &c. The position of the shoalest spot on the bank did not alter perceptibly, however, from 1861 to 1869 ; the marks for it are : St Martin's point, Guernsey, appearing midway between the Grande Fauconniere rock and the south western end of Herm island, bearing W. by S. f S. southerly ; Alderney old telegraph tower N. by E. \\ E. easterly 7f miles ; Casquets lighthouse N. by W. \\ W. 10| miles ; and, Serk windmill S.W. \\ W. 10 miles.

It must, however, be borne in mind that these marks are all distant and can only be made out in fine clear weather. Between low water and half flood, it is advisable to pass eastward of the Bane de la Schole ; but, between half ebb and low water, westward, because in both cases the tide favours the attempt. In bad weather, if the wind and tide are ever so obliquely opposed to each other, the sea breaks very dangerously on all parts of the bank. The RACE of ALDERNEY is the strait between Alderney and cape de la Hague, deriving its name from the violence of the tidal streams through the strait. Here, as in the Swinge and Ortac channels, the stream sets south -westward at half ebb by the shore, and runs in that direction, with the variations presently given, for 6 hours, or until half flood ; and the contrary is the case with the north-eastern stream, for there is but little slack water in the Race. The greatest strength of the south-western stream lasts for about 2\\ hours ; it begins 5 hours after high water at Alderney and ends 1\\ hours before the following high water. The greatest strength of the north-eastern stream continues about 2 hours ; that is, from one hour before high water at Alderney until one hour after. During equinoctial springs, the velocity of the south-western stream is nearly 7 knots, and of the north-eastern stream nearly 8 knots ; at neaps, 5-j knots. The first 2| hours of the south-western stream in the Race, from half ebb to low water, sets W.S.W. ; and, the last 2 hours, from low water to half flood, S.W. ; and, the contrary for the first and last 3-} hours of the north-eastern stream, which, between half flood and high water, sets very strongly round cape de la Hague.

From the middle of the beach at the head of St. Martin's bay to Jardeheu point, the shore is bordered by rocks which dry : outside these are others in separate groups, of which the most remarkable are the Martiauroc and the Esquina ; the former is covered only at high springs, the latter is one of the largest rocks in the bayT and has two heads very near each other, one rising 30 feet above the highest tides. Parmentiere rock. \u2014 Buoy. \u2014 Several ledges, of which some uncover, extend 5 cables north-westward of the Martiauroc, and are terminated by the Parmentiere, a rock with only 3 feet water, marked by a black buoy off its north-western edge. The opening into the bay is about 8 cables wide between the Herbeuses and the Martiauroc, but the only channel by which vessels can enter and get up to the anchorage under the fort, without a pilot, is only 2 cables wide, and is between the Parmentiere rock black buoy and the Herbeuses red buoy. JARDEHEU POINT is a small round hillock covered with herbage and separated from the hills inland by a narrow isthmus which covers at high tides ; on its summit is a mass of large rocks, and it may be easily recognised when bearing S.E. or N.W. ; it is surrounded by rocks and shoals which extend 6 cables northward.

The Hures de la Coque, a rocky ledge, extends N.N.E. 3 cables from the Coque, at which distance the depth is only 5^ fathoms, and it causes violent eddies which small vessels must be careful to avoid. One of the rocks on this ledge, lying N.N.E. \\ E. one cable from the Coque, uncovers ] 0 feet ; it covers near the time of half flood by the shore, and it may be useful to know that when it covers, the flood or eastern stream is running 2-| or 3 miles from the shore between Omonville and Cherbourg. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on Jardeheu point, see page 12. Basse Brefort, on which there are only 2\\ feet water, lies N. by E. 5 cables from Jardeheu point and the same distance N.N.W. \\ W. from the Coque. The marks for this shoal, which is dangerous to coasters, are, the summit of the Esquina rock on with a village half way up the hill westward of Jobourg church tower ; and, the Coque in line with and entirely concealing the Foireuse, a large rock lying S.S.E. \\ E. from it. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 The sudden change in the direction of the flood or north-eastern stream after passing cape de la Hague occasions a great eddy north-eastward and eastward of that cape, which extends even beyond Omonville and runs along the coast, following a direction opposed to the flood stream in the offing, for nearly nine hours, that is, from 2\\ hours before high water by the shore all through the ebb and until a little after low water. This eddy begins to form off the entrance of St. Martin's bay about half an hour after the north-eastern stream has commenced in Alderney Race, and its strength increases with that stream ; but, as it runs to the N.W., and, when near the Becchue rock, comes into almost direct opposition to the stream flowing East and E.S.E. out of the Race, it causes a cross sea which is violent in proportion to the rate of that stream. Towards the time of high water in St. Martin's bay, or fifteen minutes after high water at Goury and fifteen minutes before it at Omonville, when the stream is at its greatest strength, this confused sea extends nearly 2\\ miles from the shore, to the line of Jobourg church tower on with the Herbeuses rocks. The violence of the sea decreases as the north-eastern stream See chart, No, 1,106. SO 1188S 2 B 2"], [422, "394 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap.

A similar cross sea takes place round Jardeheu point from the meeting of the eddy, running north-westward along the shore at Omonville, with the stream of flood running East and E.S.E. between the Esquina rock and Basse Brefort. This confused sea is also violent and extends into the offing as far as the line of Jalletin guard-house on with cape de la Hague lighthouse. It commences at the same time as that near the Becchue, but, the eastern stream slacking, it ends 15 or 20 minutes before high water at Omonville, and then the north-western eddy stream runs round Jardeheu point and extends without interruption from Omonville to the Houffet rocks. The Foireuse, a rock midway between the Coque rock and Omonville harbour, is close to the outer edge of a rocky flat which runs 2 cables off the intermediate low shore, and its rounded summit is 2 feet above the high water level. A rocky ledge extends 4%V cables eastward of the Foireuse, its highest rocks uncovering 8 feet, and its eastern extreme, on which there are only 4 fathoms water, rises suddenly from soundings of from 17 to 20 fathoms and lies in the direction of the church tower at Digulleville a quarter of a point open southward of the church tower at Omonville W.S.W. southerly. OMONVILLE. \u2014 This small harbour lies in a slight indentation of the coast one mile south-eastward of Jardeheu point and affords shelter with winds from N.N.W. round by West to S.E. ; but, when the rocky ledges which form the harbour are covered, much sea sets in, and it should only be considered as a fine weather anchorage to await a favourable opportunity for passing through the Race of Alderney. The position of the harbour may be easily recognised from a distance by the village of Omonville, situated at the bottom of a valley, the slopes of which are highly cultivated ; by a large fort erected on the south-eastern point of the indentation ; by an old semaphore called the Vigie, on the top of the hill, at the foot of which stands the sort ; and, by a large mass of rock on the summit of the hill bounding the valley on the North.

Here vessels anchor at low water in from 13 to 15 feet, sand. The depths increase gradually from the beach to 7 fathoms immediately outside the rocks. A Life-boat and all other life-saving appliances are stationed at this port. Directions. \u2014 When standing for Omonville harbour with light airs from S.W. or S.E., after half flood, vessels should take care to close the land south-eastward of the port to avoid missing the entrance on account of the eddy, described at page 393, which commences to run north-westward across the entrance about that time, and runs at the rate of 2-j knots, at springs. With all winds sufficiently strong to ensure stemming the stream, a vessel may run directly for the entrance ; taking care, if from the westward, when rounding the rocky ledge extending from the Foireuse rock, to have Digulleville church tower at least half a point open southward of Omonville church tower. Tides. \u2014 It is high water in Omonville harbour at 7h. 29m., full and change ; springs rise 15j feet ; neaps 12^ feet.

This low shore is bordered by a beach of sand, gravel, and rocks, which uncovers at low water, and, in several places, extends 3 or 4 cables off-shore. Outside the beach is a rocky bank with irregular depths extending nearly a mile from high water mark. Raz de Bannes.\u2014 Beacon turret.\u2014 Raz de Bannes is the north-western part of the rocky bank just described ; it lies between the bearings N. | W. and N.E. from TJrville church tower, and many of its rocks uncover ; the highest dries 4^ feet, and on it stands a beacon turret, 10 feet above high water, springs, painted red with a black top and an iron ball as top-mark.

Plateau de Nacqueville, off Nacqueville point, is the north eastern part of the same rocky ledge ; and, from its eastern extreme, the western part of the Redoute des Couplets, on the summit of a hill southward of St. Anne's bay, is on with the outer wall of the circular battery of Querqueville fort. Large vessels should avoid crossing the plateau at low water, as the tide then causes strong ripples, and though there are from 6 to 9 fathoms over all the outer part, a small 9 feet patch lies 3j cables from the shore. Anchorage. \u2014 A vessel, waiting a favourable time to enter Cherbourg road, may anchor between the Plateau de Nacqueville and Querqueville point in 1\\ fathoms, good holding-ground of muddy sand.

One hour after high water, it runs S.S.W., but its rate does not exceed a knot, and, as its strength decreases, it assumes a more westerly direction and finally comes to an end about 2 hours after high water at Cherbourg. The direction of the western stream varies only from West to N.W. from the time of its commencement until 4^ hours after high water at Cherbourg ; but, as its speed decreases, it turns successively to all the points between N.W. and West, where it ends 3h. 45m. before high water. Its greatest velocity, about 3^ knots, occurs from 4 to 5 hours after high water at Cherbourg. At 3 or 4 miles northward of the Mermistin and of Querqueville point, the flood stream begins 3 hours before, and ends about 3 hours after, high water at Cherbourg. Generally speaking, at that distance from the shore, eastward of the Mermistin, and also in the middle of the English channel, the changes of the tidal streams take place at the times of half flood and half ebb at Cherbourg, which is about equivalent to high and low water at Dover ; see Table, page 425.

A British Consul is resident at Cherbourg, the consulate being near the port du Commerce. Coal and Supplies.\u2014 Coals, usually Welsh, are always available for steamers, a coal hulk containing about 400 tons being moored in the roads, alongside of which steamers coal, the price being about 20 francs per ton, but varying considerably ; the stock in hand on shore is usually from 3,000 to 4,000 tons. Vessels in the Commercial port can also coal alongside the quays in about 12 feet water. Supplies of all kinds are plentiful, and ordinary repairs to sailing vessels or steamers can be well executed, there being a dry dock in the Commercial port, see page 404. The dry docks and other appliances of the arsenal are, of course, not under ordinary circumstances available for mercantile purposes. There is no Sailor's home at Cherbourg, but, in case of sickness or accident, sailors are admitted to the Civil or Marine hospital, on the recommendation of Her Majesty's Consul, with guarantee of expenses. The number of merchant vessels entering the port annually is about 600, and their aggregate tonnage 225,000 tons. Steamers run five times weekly to Southampton, and once a week to Guernsey ; transatlantic steamers also call, the Royal Mail from the West Indies fortnightly, and the Hamburgh steamers from New York weekly. The Western railroad brings Paris within 9 hours distance, and connects with Le Mans, Granville, St. Malo, Caen, and by branches with Brest, Havre, Saint Lo, &c. The telegraphic service is very complete from all points served by the railway, and the coast Semaphore service enables messages to be rapidly forwarded to almost all parts ; see page 12.

Upon this foundation is built a wall of masonry, nearly vertical, 33 feet wide at the base and decreasing to 27 feet at the top, which, with the parapet, rises 23 feet above the level of high water, springs. The breakwater is not straight but consists of two arms of unequal length, each diverging 5\u00b0 towards the harbour, the western arm being about one-third longer than the eastern. The work was begun in the year 1784, was several times interrupted, but was brought to a successful close in 1853. The chief engineers employed on it were De Cessart, De Lamblardie, Cachin, Fouques-Duparc, Virla, Bonnin, and Reibell, and they have constructed a work of which France may be justly proud. It is defended by Fort Central placed at the point where the arms diverge, by forts at each end, named respectively forts de l'Ouest and de l'Est, and by an inter mediate battery on the western arm. A large black buoy marks the western extreme of the foundation of the breakwater, and a red buoy its eastern extreme.* * The first idea of sheltering Cherbourg bay by an artificial work dates as far back as 1665, but the first real project was in 1775 by M. de la Bretormiere, Capitaine de Vaisseau. In 1781 the proposal of M. de Cessart, engineer, to forma breakwater by sinking frustra of cones filled with stone was adopted, and the first cone was sunk in 1784. After 18 such cones had been sunk this plan was abandoned in 1788, and that of depositing stone a pierre perdue was adopted and followed up with occasional intervals until the breakwater reached above high water, but as in that form it could not witlistand the force of the sea. M. Fouques-Duparc proposed, in 1829, a vertical wall of masonry based upon the rubble foundation rising from the level of low water of equinoctial spring tides. Such a wall was begun in 1832 and carried on to completion at the close of 1853. Since then the forts have been in progress. The whole cost of the breakwater has been 2,671,491?., or at the rate of 220/. a lineal foot, measured from end to end of the foot of the embankment. \u2014 Bonnin, Sur I' Achecement de la Digue de Cherbourg.

It leaves the shore at Greves point and its direction for nearly 1,000 yards is N. | E. ; it then curves westward during the next 400 yards, and finally runs nearly 800 yards N.W. to its junction with Fort Imperial on ile Pelee, its total length being about 2,200 yards. About 2\\ cables from Greves point an opening about 70 yards wide is left for coasters, in which the depth is about 5 feet at low water ; there are also several small openings near Fort Imperial.

St. Anne's bay is upwards of a mile wide between Querqueville breakwater and the ramparts of Cherbourg ; its shore, on which are several batteries, is low and almost entirely bordered by rocks which uncover at low water. Of these, the Rochefort, a large rock at the head of the bay, is about 2 cables from high-water mark, and 6 cables S. by W. from Fort Chavagnac ; its summit is 2 feet above the level of the highest tides. The western part of this bay is well sheltered from all but north easterly winds by Querqueville breakwater, but the water is not deep, the 3-fathoms line averaging 4f cables from the shore, with only 3 feet water close to its edge at one part ; so that, taking Fort Chavagnac as a centre, a radius of about 3^ cables from it will include all the available anchorage space, and this is now prohibited altogether as an anchorage, see page 408.

This 12-feet patch is much in the way of large vessels beating in or out of Cherbourg road, and should be avoided, at springs, from one third ebb to two thirds flood, and at all times of tide during neaps. See plan, No. 2,602."], [430, "[Chap. IX. 402 CHERBOURG. Fort Chavagnac stands on a small rocky patch fronting St. Anne's bay, close to the outer end but inside of Querqueville breakwater, with which it will probably be connected, and there is now no passage between them ; the patch is about 150 yards long and from 50 to 60 yards wide. The southern and eastern sides are almost steep-to. Cherbourg bay is bounded on its western side by the Tenarde and other rocks off Fort du Hornet, and on its eastern side by the Flamands rocks, and ile Pelee with its breakwater. The town of Cherbourg and the port du Commerce occupy the head of the bay, and the establishments of the Arsenal or port Militaire the western side, between the town and Fort du Hornet. The shore is low from the front of the town to the Flamands, and is bordered by a sandy strand 2^ cables wide at low water, with shallow flats of less than 3 fathoms extending 3 or 4 cables farther out. The whole of the bay eastward of the Flamands and towards ile Pelee breakwater is very shallow. The low land adjoining the shore of Cherbourg bay soon rises into high hills, between which are the valleys of Roule and Tourlaville. The entrance to the Roule valley is between two hills of unequal height southward of the bassin-a-flot or wet dock, of the port du Commerce ; the eastern hill, Mont Roule, is steep and crowned by Fort Roule at only three quarters of a mile inland, which fort commands all the neighbourhood ; on the top of the western hill is a Semaphore.

There are from 19 to 21 ft. water over rocky bottom between the Tenarde and the shore, but a rocky flat, with an 11-ft. patch at its extreme, extends E. J N. 2 cables from the fort. The Roches des Flamands are close to the south-eastern shore of the bay and their highest parts uncover at low water. A strong fort, erected on these rocks, is approached from the shore by a causeway and drawbridge. Shoal ground with from 7 to 18 feet water extends 4 cables north-westward from Fort des Flamands, and northward, this flat extends still farther from the shore, being separated from the eastern end of Cherbourg breakwater by only 3 cables. Eastward of the fort and everywhere near ile Pelee breakwater the water is very shallow, but there is a 6-feet channel leading up to the opening in that breakwater. Port d'Echonage. \u2014 On the eastern side of Fort des Flamands is this small harbour, chiefly used by vessels of not more than 300 tons burthen laden with timber for the use of the Dockyard. A canal connects it with the Mare de Tourlaville to the eastward, where building timber is stored, and which is 50 acres in extent. The Port du Commerce consists of an Avant-port, with the channel leading to it, and a Bassin-a-flot, formed by damming and excavating at the mouth of the little river Divette which waters the Roule valley. The entrance lies between two stone jetties parallel with each other and 60 yards apart ; the western jetty is only half the length of the eastern jetty, and both are marked by the lights described at page 401. The bottom of the channel is a mixture of sand, mud, gravel, and shingle. Depths. \u2014 The dredged channel through the entrance and Avant port up to the Bassin-a-flot, and also alongside the jetty for the accommodation of the Southampton steamers, has a depth of 25f feet at high water springs, 21 feet at neaps, and 5 feet at low water, springs ; over the sill of the Bassin-a-flot there is one foot less.

Avant-Port.\u2014 Just within the inner end of the western pier of the Avant-port is a small slipway, with the custom-house adjoining. At 60 yards southward of this slipway, a pier projects eastward from the western quay, to break the swell which sets in with strong northerly winds. The Avant-port is surrounded on three sides by granite quays, and, within the short pier just described, is 328 yards long in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction, 212 yards wide, and dries at low water on the western side, where the bottom is of rock but with a covering of muddy sand, affording good grounding berths to the merchant vessels for whose use this side is appropriated. The eastern side is occupied by Government vessels, and by the jetty before mentioned, built for the Southampton packets. The swell and surf, though much diminished, still sets in through the channel with heavy gales from N.W. to N.E. ; vessels making any staj- in the port should, therefore, enter the Bassin-a-flot as soon as possible. The Bassin-a-flot, or wet dock, is 418 yards long and 128 yards wide, having an area of 12| acres : it communicates with the outer harbour by a double parallel entrance of which the eastern is the widest and deepest, being 52Jj feet wide and having 24| feet water over the sill at high water, springs, a considerable portion of the basin being dredged to a slightly greater depth ; the sill of the western entrance has 6 feet less water over it, and the width is only 42^ feet ; both entrances are closed by gates which usually remain open about an hour and a half, but are shut with a falling tide. There are building slips at the head of the basin, and a dry dock 249^ feet in length over all by 46 feet wide at the entrance, and with 16 feet over the sill at high water, springs. As vessels are not permitted to enter without pilots, and as a pilot can always board a vessel in the Little road, it is unnecessary to give directions for entering the port du Commerce. Port de l'Onglet has its entrance 3 cables north-westward of the piers of the port du Commerce, and the walls of the arsenal form its western side ; it is a little inlet, with from 2 to 5 feet at low water, springs, very useful for boats and small craft which can make fast alongside its quays at all times of tide, but its entrance, See plan, No. 2,602."], [433, "Chap.

It is especially appropriated for vessels of war, and is a naval dockyard of the first class ; it is surrounded by fortifications, Fort du Hornet being its principal defence towards the sea. The port, properly so called, consists of three extensive basins. The outer tidal basin or Avant-port, of 16 acres, communicates with the roadstead by a short channel opening eastward, in which the least depth is 15 feet ; and, with the Bassin Charles X., of 15 acres, by gates 59 feet wide, having their sill 13^ feet below the level of the lowest tides. Both these basins have been excavated in the solid rock to a depth of about 32 feet below that level. An inner basin named the Bassin Napoleon III., of 20 acres in extent, was opened in August, 1858. It has seven large building slips and one dry dock on its western side, four dry docks at the northern end, and two dry docks at the southern end. There are also four building slips on the southern side of the Avant-port, making in all eleven building slips and seven docks. The two longest docks are 514 and 499 feet in length over all, with 108 and 120 feet width of entrance, and about 26 and 36^ feet over the sills at high water, ordinary springs ; the shortest dock is 257^ feet in length by 78-7 feet width of entrance, and about 17^ feet over the sill. The other docks vary in dimensions, but four of them have 29^ feet water over the sills at high water, ordinary springs. The quays and docks are faced with fine granite from Dielette, Flamanville, and Chausey. The space for steam factory and workshops is small in comparison with the other works. Time Signal. \u2014 The time signal is shown from the look-out of Fort l'Onglet, Quay Napoleon, at 35 feet above high-water level. It is made by means of a metal disc about 3 feet in diameter ; the disc is placed in a vertical position five minutes before signal time, and is dropped to a horizontal position at the instant, by electricity, from the Naval Observatory. The time signal is made at lOh. A.M. Paris mean time, equivalent to 21h. 50m. 39s. Greenwich mean time ; and is repeated at lOh. 2m. Paris mean time. When not in use, the disc is inclined at an angle of 45\u00b0. See plan, No. 2,602."], [434, "[Chap. IX. 406 CHERBOURG. ILE PELEE. \u2014 Beacon turrets. \u2014 This isle is all that remains of the long point which formerly extended nearly 1^ miles north ward from point de Greves, but was separated from it by the action of the sea, leaving the shallow channel between it and the mainland nearly half a mile wide, which has now been again reduced in width by the construction of the breakwater described at page 400. The isle is a flat of bare rock, nearly covered at high water ; but, at low water, springs, it is about three quarters of a mile long from North to South by half a mile wide, and is in the form of a horseshoe concave towards the East ; its highest point is a heap of stones awash at high water, equinoctial springs. Fort Imperial stands on the western point of the isle ; on its south-western bastion is a flag staff, and the fixed white light already' described is exhibited from the north-eastern bastion ; both bastions are sufficiently high to be seen at a distance of 10 or 12 miles seaward. The north-western and north-eastern extremes of the isle are marked respectively by the Tromet and Happetout beacon turrets. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the south-eastern and highest part of Fort Imperial ; see page 12. DANGERS on ILE PELEE FLAT.\u2014 The principal dangers which do not uncover upon the outer part of the rocky flat forming the base of ile Pelee are, the Basse de Happetout, the Roches du Nord-Ouest, and the Truite rock. Basse de Happetout, a small isolated rocky patch with only 13 feet water, is at the north-eastern extreme of the dangers of ile Pelee. It lies E. N. 91 cables from Fort Imperial lighthouse, with the high battery of Fort du Hornet just open northward of the lower battery of Fort Imperial ; and, the small houses adjoining the eastern part of the barrack at the Becquet de Denneville on with the houses of a farm on the height above the limestone quarries called the Becquet cliffs. A little westward of the Happetout is another patch with 3 fathoms water. The rocky flat of ile Pelee extends 2 cables in a northerly direction from the northern side of the isle, and as the sea is always disturbed upon it, and the soundings vary from 9 to 23 feet it is prudent for vessels to avoid approaching its northern edge. The spire of Querqueville church well open northward of Fort Central leads clear of it. See plan, No. 2,602."], [435, "Chap. IX.] ILE PELEE. \u2014 DANGERS. 407 Roches du Nord-Ouest.\u2014 Buoy.\u2014 There are 4 fathoms on the western extreme of these rocks at low water, but 70 or 80 yards eastward of this are some rocky heads with from 14 to 11 feet. A black buoy lies westward of the point of the shoal in about 5 fathoms, with Fort Imperial lighthouse bearing S.S.E. 4\u00a3 cables, and the Truite buoy S. by W. \u00a7 W. 2 cables nearly. The flood stream sets strongly towards the point of these rocks, which becomes very dangerous when with westerly winds the stream is at its greatest strength. The Truite rock.\u2014 Buoy.\u2014 This rock, lying at the western point of -the flat on the eastern side of the Passe de l'Est or eastern channel in Cherbourg road, is about 100 yards long, East and West, and 60 yards wide. A black buoy is moored in about 5 fathoms at 70 yards N. by W. from the western extreme of the shoal, and N.W. 3 cables from Fort Imperial lighthouse. The shoalest spot is near the centre of the rock, where there are only 3 feet water. The marks for the western end in 10 feet, are, the end of the eastern pier of the port du Commerce seen a little southward of the square tower of Sainte Trinite church, Cherbourg ; and, the barracks at Becquet open half their length southward of the outer wall of the low battery and south-western bastion of Fort Imperial. Caution. \u2014 Although there is much less sea in the vicinity of the Truite than off the Roches du Nord-Ouest, both buoys are liable to drift from their exposed positions, and more dependence should be placed on the landmarks given than on the buoys being in their places. The Pelee bank is the sand-bank extending westward from Pelee isle and breakwater into the most sheltered part of the Grande Rade. There are 23 feet on its western extreme S.S.W. \\ W. 3 cables from Fort Central, and its 5-fathoms limit is 2 cables farther north-westward. It forms the northern and eastern limits of the roadstead for deep ships, but there is excellent shelter for vessels of moderate draught between it and the eastern arm of Cherbourg breakwater. ANCHORAGES. \u2014 The principal anchorages for ships of war and large vessels are, the Grande Rade, and that near the break water eastward of the intermediate fort and extending beyond See plan, No. 2,602. 2 C SO 11886"], [436, "[Chap. IX. 408 CHERBOURG. Fort Central ; and, for smaller vessels, the Petite Rade, and the eastern part of the anchorage near the breakwater. St. Anne's bay, as described at page 401, does not afford good anchorage, and is within the prohibited area. THE GRANDE RADE is bounded on its northern and north eastern sides by the Pelee bank, and its western limit is the meridian of Cherbourg cathedral. This road is specially reserved for large men-of-war ; for which purpose, three rows of mooring buoys, lying nearly parallel with each other, are provided, numbered from 9 to 22. Two more lines of mooring buoys, numbered from 0 to 8, are placed southward of the others ; they are for vessels of less draught of water. In addition, and immediately off the dockyard, are four large mooring buoys used by ships in the adjustment of their compasses. The bottom in the northern part of the road is for the most part composed of schistose rock in a state of decomposition, and the holding-ground is good ; immediately southward of this rock the bottom is of fine muddy sand which is not sufficiently stiff to hold well, but it improves on nearing the shore. Prohibited anchorage. \u2014 Vessels not using the Government mooring buoys may not anchor within their lines nor at a less dis tance than 1J cables from any of them. Anchorage beyond the following limits is also forbidden altogether, viz. : \u2014 Westward of an imaginary line drawn from the intermediate fort on Cherbourg breakwater to the buoy of the Tenarde reef, and southward of a line from Querqueville lighthouse to a position 2| cables northward of Fort de l'Ouest. Also, eastward of a line drawn from Fort des Flamands through Fort de l'Est, and southward of a line drawn through Tromet and Happetout beacon turrets ; but small vessels may anchor eastward of the Passe de l'Est, i.e., eastward of a line drawn from Happetout beacon turret to Fort des Flamands. Disregard of these regulations subjects the offender to severe penalties. There is excellent anchorage during all northerly winds within the permitted limits, close to the breakwater and on ile Pelee flat in from 4 to 6 fathoms, sand, shells, and a little mud ; it is chiefly used by merchant vessels seeking refuge during northerly gales. The deepest water and best swinging room is in the western part of this anchorage, as also the best holding-ground. See plan, No. 2,602,"], [437, "Chap. IX.] ANCHORAGES. \u2014 CHANNELS INTO CHERBOURG. 409 The Petite Rade has good holding-ground, is southward of all the mooring buoys, and is well sheltered by Fort du Hornet and the dockyard from westerly winds. It is used by gunboats and despatch vessels, and by merchant vessels waiting tide to enter the port du Commerce. Southward of the buoys, the soundings decrease rather rapidly from 3^ and 4 fathoms to 12 feet, within a distance of 2 cables. Vessels entering the port du Commerce may anchor well to the eastward, as at half-flood the in-shore eddy sets westward and assists their entering. CHANNELS into the RADE de CHERBOURG.\u2014 Ships of war and vessels of deep draught enter the road by the channels round both ends of Cherbourg breakwater, the western channel being named the Passe de l'Ouest, and the eastern channel the Passe de l'Est. The Passe de l'Ouest is available at all times for the deepest ships ; the Passe de l'Est is only available for such ships between half flood and half ebb. Passe de l'Ouest. \u2014 The Passe de l'Ouest is the best channel and is about half a mile wide ; there is no difficulty in entering by it with a leading wind, vessels having only to approach the western end of Cherbourg breakwater on about a S.S.E. bearing, and, on nearing it, to pass midway between it and Querqueville breakwater ; those of deep draught turning in with the flood stream, after passing within the breakwaters and Fort Chavagnac, must be careful to avoid the rocky ground with 12 feet water E.N.E. 5 cables from the Roche fort rock, and also the Tenarde shoal ; it is imprudent to turn through at night unless the weather is clear and moonlight. Passe de l'Est is between the eastern end of Cherbourg break water and the two black buoys, before described, marking the most dangerous spots on the western edge of ile Pelee flat, viz., the Roches du Nord-Ouest and the Truite rock. The narrowest part of the channel is 2^ cables wide between the breakwater and Truite buoys, and has in it from 28 to 32 feet, the deepest water being close to the breakwater ; but, besides being narrow, this channel has the dis advantage of being crossed obliquely by the tidal streams, rendering it dangerous for sailing vessels with light winds and impracticable during calms ; there is, however, no difficulty or danger in a steamer or with a commanding breeze. See plan, No. 2,602. 2 C SO I18S6"], [438, "410 [Chap. IX. CHERBOURG. Vessels from the eastward intending to run through this channel on the flood, should be careful to give a good berth to the Roches du Nord-Ouest, keeping rather westward of the exact line of the channel until the point of that shoal is passed as the flood stream sets strongly towards it. Octeville church just open eastward of Fort de l'Est S.W. \u00a3 W. leads clear of it, should the buoy be gone ; and, on closing the fort, alter course so as to pass between the Truite black buoy and the red buoy off the eastern end of the breakwater. The shallow entrance channel from the eastward through the opening in ile Pelee breakwater has a W. N. and E. S. direction, and carries only from 5 to 7 feet in the best water for at least 7 cables ; it is therefore fit only for coasters or for the smallest class of gun boats, torpedo boats, &c. When within the breakwater, the narrow channel is bounded on the North by the Basse du Chenal, which is almost awash at the lowest tides. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Cherbourg at 8h. 0m. ; ordinary springs rise 20f feet, and neaps 16 feet above the datum or zero of soundings as on plan No. 2,602. Strong westerly winds in the entrance of the English channel cause an increased rise of one or 2 feet even during calm weather in the vicinity of the port ; easterly winds have a contrary effect. During westerly gales, at springs, the sea frequently overflows the quays of the outer harbour of the port du Commerce. The mean duration of the rising tide is 5h. 45m., and of the ebb 6h. 35m. Tidal Streams.\u2014 (See also Table, page 425.)\u2014 The flood stream begins to be felt in the Grande Rade half an hour after low water by the shore and ceases three quarters of an hour after high water ; its direction is south-easterly and its rate about 2 knots. The greatest speed of the north-western or ebb stream hardly ever exceeds 1^ knots unless the wind is strong from N.E. or East. In the anchorage near Cherbourg breakwater, the eastern stream commences about an hour after low water and ends an hour after high water. The streams are feeble throughout the whole extent of this anchorage. The Petite Rade is in the eddy of the flood stream occasioned by the projection of Hornet point. This eddy extends beyond the northern limit of the Petite Rade, forming a counter stream which See plan, No, 2,602,"], [439, "Chap. IX.] TIDES. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 411 sweeps along the shore in a W.N.W. direction from about 3 or 4 cables eastward of the entrance to the port du Commerce to the head of the bay, and then northward along the boundary wall of the dockyard. It begins about half flood and continues until high water ; its greatest rate is about 1^ knots, at springs, and its rate decreases towards high water, finally merging in the true ebb stream which follows the same direction, and, at half ebb, when at its greatest strength, ts rate is about 2 knots. About half a mile northward of the Passe de l'Ouest, the flood stream, which runs S.S.E. and S.E., commences about 1^ hours after low water by the shore, and ceases lh. 20m. after high water, its greatest speed being 3 knots. The ebb runs N.W. by N. at nearly the same rate. In the entrance, the flood stream first takes a S.S.W. direction, but, as it gains its greatest strength, which is about 2 knots at springs, it inclines towards S.S.E. The direction of the ebb varies from N.N.W. to N.W., its rate being nearly the same as that of the flood. The flood stream ceases at the western end of the breakwater about an hour after high water. The flood stream begins to be felt in the Passe de l'Est one hour after low water, and ceases one hour after high water. Its direction is E. by S. between the breakwater and Truite buoys, and its greatest speed, at from 4 to 5 hours flood, is 2j knots ; but, a little northward of this position, the stream runs East 3| knots. At the edge of the Roches du Nord-Ouest and along the northern edge of ile Pelee flats, its direction is E.N.E., and its greatest rate 4 knots. The eddies formed by the uneven rocks on the flat produce a violent and dangerous race. The ebb stream is subject to less variation and its rate is rather less than the flood. It runs along the northern edge of ile Pelee, and, from thence, West, until the rocks are uncovered ; but, outside the flat and Cherbourg breakwater, its direction is W.N.W. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 Approaching Cherbourg from the Westward.\u2014 The western end of Cherbourg breakwater bears S.E. i E. 85 miles from Start point ; S. by E. \\ E. 59 miles from the Bill of Portland ; and S. by W. \\ W. 59 miles from the entrance to the Needles.

IX. 412 CHERBOURG. coast of England, proceeding exactly as if bound for an eastern English port, as directed in Channel Pilot, part I., until arrived at a proper position to haul over towards the French coast. Thus, when bound for Cherbourg, proceed by the English shore until abreast of the Start, when having ascertained the vessel's position and the weather being clear, a course may be shaped to make the Casquets ; or, bearing in mind the great strength and variety of the tidal streams in the neighbourhood of the Casquets and to avoid all danger of being carried through the Ortac, Swinge, or Race channels, especially should the weather be at all doubtful, it may be better to make Portland and then stand across for the French coast, shaping a course about half a point westward of cape Barfleur. The ship's position may th'-n be accurately fixed by cross bearings of capes de la Hague and Barfleur by day or of their lights by night ; the white side of Mont Roule is also a conspicuous object by day, being visible at a distance of 20 miles in clear weather. Should it be determined to make the Casquets, consider carefully the direction of the wind and tidal streams as well as the state of the weather, which, unless clear, may render the approach to these islets not only difficult but dangerous. On nearing them, great care must be taken to avoid being set southward of them, especially whilst the tide is flowing on their shores, when there would be great risk of being drawn into the Swinge channel and being obliged to cross Alderney Race at the time the sea is most agitated. From a position about 9 miles N.W. of the Casquets, the course to be steered must depend greatly upon wind and tide. With the wind anywhere from W.S.W. round by North to N.N.E., and making due allowance for tide, a course of about E. S. for 14 miles leads 5 miles northward of all danger up to the meridian of the western point of Alderney, when cape de la Hague lighthouse should bear about S.E. | S. 13 miles ; then an E.S.E. course for 11 miles leads to a position from which the lighthouse, well open of the land, bears S.S.W. 65 miles ; and, from thence, a S.E. by S. course for 14jj miles leads to the western entrance into Cherbourg road. These courses keep a vessel a safe distance outside the dangers, and also beyond the influence of the strong tidal streams running through the Ortac and Swinge channels and Alderney Race ; but, with the wind between W.S.W. and S.S.W., and the north-eastern See chart, No. J, \"OS, and plan, No. 2,602."], [441, "Chap. IX.] 413 DIRECTIONS. stream running through these channels, to prevent being drifted too far northward, an E. by S. J S. course may be shaped from the first position given (N.W. 9 miles from the Casquets) which leads about 2^ or 3 miles from the shore on the meridian of cape de la Hague, and Cherbourg road can then be gained without difficulty ; whereas, with south-westerly winds, if during the eastern stream the meridian of cape de la Hague should be crossed at 6 or 7 miles from the shore, a sailing vessel runs great risk of missing the entrance to Cherbourg road. During the western stream, with a fresh breeze, a heavy sea will be found off the entrances of all these channels. At night. \u2014 Approaching the western channel into Cherbourg road ; when eastward of cape de la Hague, keep its light in sight over the land until Querqueville fixed white light bears S.S.W., then stand to the southward for the entrance, and when the fixed white light in Fort Imperial, ile Pelee, is nearly in line with the flashing white light on the western end of Cherbourg breakwater, be guided by the latter in entering the road. The most unfavourable winds for a sailing vessel to approach Cherbourg from the direction of the Casquets, are those from the eastward, and especially a south-easterly wind. With a moderate breeze, however, from these quarters, the sea is generally smooth, and, during the eastern stream, the passage is not difficult ; but, with the western stream, it is for a sailing vessel impossible, and she should then make a long board to the northward and endeavour to hold her own until the stream slacks ; then the shore should be again approached to take advantage of the first of the eastern stream, and long boards made in order to reach the roadstead or a position eastward of its meridian, so as to enter with the latter part of the flood or the beginning of the ebb. On account of the great strength of the tidal streams, calm and fog are chiefly to be feared when making this passage, and, if threatened by either, every effort should be made to get into the middle of the Channel where the streams are much weaker than near the French coast. From the Eastward. \u2014 The course and distance from 2 miles southward of the Royal Sovereign light-vessel to cape Barfleur is S.W. by W. | W. 89 miles.

IX. 414 CHERBOURG. Dover strait, generally steer direct for cape Barfleur, but with other winds they should endeavour to confirm their reckoning by the bearings of some headland on the English or French coasts ; thus, with northerly winds Beachy head should be made, and, with southerly winds, cape d'Antifer, or the lighthouse at Fecamp, which latter may be seen at a distance of 20 miles. The most unfavourable winds for making this passage are those between NW. and W.S.W. ; but, as the change of stream in mid Channel is 2 or 3 hours later than near the shore, it is often possible to keep in a favourable stream 8 or 9 hours out of the 12. Approach ing cape Barfleur during the eastern stream, in order to avoid being drawn into the bay of the Seine or into Barfleur race, where the tide runs with great strength, do not stand into less than 22 fathoms water, which depth may be found about 2 miles from the cape ; the same distance and depth should also be preserved with the west going stream, to keep outside the race and the short chopping sea off that cape on a weather tide. Between cape Barfleur and cape Levi, do not stand into less than 26 fathoms as the dangers between these capes extend 2\\ miles from the shore ; and a berth of at least 2 miles should be given to cape Levi to clear the foul ground off it. To avoid being embayed between cape Levi and ile Pelee, where a sudden shift of wind might place her in difficulty, and also to avoid the dangers on ile Pelee flat, a large vessel turning to windward between the cape and island should not stand farther southward than to have Querqueville spire on with the northern tangent of Fort Central ; at night, she should tack when Fort de l'Ouest light bears West, or cape Levi light E. by S. Leaving Cherbourg.\u2014 Sailing vessels bound westward from Cherbourg do well not to leave the road until the wind is sufficiently settled to carry them clear of the English Channel. They generally stand out through the western channel at the commencement of the ebb, and, if the wind is light, after passing Fort du Hornet, borrow towards Cherbourg breakwater to avoid Querqueville breakwater and the Chavagnac rock, towards which the ebb stream sets. When on the meridian of cape de la Hague, and 6 or 7 miles from it, they steer about W.N.W. until the Casquets bear S.S.E. when a W. by S. course takes them out of the channel.

Bound eastward from the Rade de Cherbourg with a westerly wind, weigh towards half flood ; or, if in the bassin-a-flot of the port du Commerce, quit it as soon as the gates are open and run out by the eastern channel, see page 409. When well clear of this channel, a vessel leaving the road at half flood by the shore will have the beginning of the Channel flood stream, an! if favoured with a fresh breeze, she will carry-that stream for 8 or 9 hours to the eastward. The Coast between ile Pelee and cape Levi, which bears from it East 4 miles, forms a bight where sailing vessels should avoid getting embayed. From ile Pelee breakwater to the middle of this bight, the shore is low and broken into small projections, of which the most remarkable is Heu point in front of Bretteville village. A short distance inland are the calcareous cliffs known as Becquet quarries, one of the most remarkabie objects in the neighbourhood of Cherbourg.

CAPE LEVI RACE is occasioned by the strong tides and uneven rocky ground which extends N. by E. \\ E. 2 miles from the cape. This rocky ground is in some places 5 cables wide, is consfderably higher than the general level of the bottom, and, as it lies across the direction of the tidal streams, it causes a heavy sea, especially on a weather tide. It is stated by local pilots that with strong easterly winds on the flood, at springs, this Race is as dangerous and the sea as bad as in Alderney Race. Some patches rising from the rocky bottom in this Race are dangerous even for small vessels at all times of tide ; they are the Bieroc patch, Basse du Cap Levi, Pierre Noire, and Tete Septentrionale or northern head of the Race, The BierOC patch is small and rocky, with only 3 feet water H cables northward of the Bieroc, from which it derives its name.

The Tete Septentrionale is at the north-western extreme of the rocky bottom, N. \\ W. 1% miles from the Bieroc ; E. by. N. northerly rather more than 6 miles from Fort Central ; and N.W. by W. \\ W. 8| miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse. There are 33 feet on this rocky head at low water, but as it rises precipitously from soundings of from 19 to 25 fathoms, it causes great eddies, and the sea breaks on it in bad weather. Tidal streams. \u2014 Between cape Levi and the Bieroc, the eastern stream commences at the time of low water at Cherbourg and it extends farther out as the tide rises, commencing at the Tete Septentrionale at 1^ hours flood ; its greatest strength is 5 knots. The flood sets E. by N. \\ N., the ebb W. by N. \\ N. The western stream commences in-shore half an hour before high water at Cherbourg but does not extend so far out as the Pierre Noire until 2 hours ebb. Vessels of moderate draught in charge of pilots may, if the weather permits, pass through the race between the Basse du Cap Levi and the Pierre Noire, at low water, but large vessels should alwayS pass northward of the Race. The Coast between cape Levi and cape Barfleur, which are distant 8 miles from each other and on the same parallel of latitude, is generally low and sandy, but the adjacent lands rise at a short distance from the shore and are joined to the hills in the interior by slight undulations, of which the highest are Carne ville heath, the woody mound at St. Pierre, the hills bounding Saire valley, and Pernelle hill. ANSE de la MONDREE, immediately eastward of cape Levi, between the Bieroc and Blanche rocks, is about 1^ miles wide and recedes about 7 cables ; there is good anchorage on its western side, in 1\\ fathoms, muddy bottom, where vessels turning to windward against westerly winds may wait during the flood ; but, it must be used only in the finest weather, for should a vessel surprised .\u25a0yv chart, No. 1,106."], [447, "Chap.

The best anchorage is with the Bieroc bearing N.W. by N. 3| cables ; and, the Semaphore on cape Levi about W.S.W. With strong northerly winds, no landing can be effected in this bay, nor upon any part of the coast between capes Levi and Barfleur, except in Roubaril cove near the latter. Roubaril cove. \u2014 This small cove, half a mile westward of cape Barfleur is sheltered by a little stone jetty, behind which fishing boats lie ; and, in the cove, coasters take refuge in time of need. The local fishermen state that, in case of necessity, a vessel under 12 feet draught might be saved by running into it at high water. The cove is about 100 yards wide and a cable deep, and the rocks bordering its sides are always uncovered. The water flows into it at about half flood. DANGERS Off the COAST.\u2014 The coast between capes Levi and Barfleur is studded with dangers, of which some extend 2h miles into the offing ; between them and the shore are the Hedouin and other winding channels, through which coasting vessels with good pilots may pass even at low water. The Sen is a small isolated rock, just awash at the lowest tides, 8 cables from the shore N.N.E. \\ E. from Coqueville church. Basses du Sen. \u2014 These shoals are numerous separate patches, extending westward, northward, and eastward of the Sen rock. The shoal northward of the rock is 8 cables long and 3^ cables wide ; it has two dangerous rocky heads, of which one has only 4^ feet water ; on the other, which from its position is called the Tete du Milieu, there are 5i feet. North-westward of this shoal are four isolated rocky heads, with from 21 to 31 feet water ; from the Tete du Nord-Ouest, the outer of these heads, Gatteville church tower on with a rock awash at the highest neaps at Neville point bears S.E. \\ S. ; and St. Pierre church tower on with a house at Coqueville, which on that bearing appears to stand a little westward of Coqueville church tower, S. by W. i W.

A fifth rocky head with 9 fathoms water lies N. by E. 8 cables from the Tete du Milieu ; it is dangerous only on account of the heavy sea occasioned by the eddies. There are no dangers between the Sen shoals and cape Levi race, and 6 or 7 fathoms water will be found at the outer edges of the rocks and banks which extend as far as 6 cables from the shore. Renier flat. \u2014 Beacons. \u2014 The Renier is a small rock uncovering 4 feet at one mile from the shore at the northern angle of a triangular rocky flat, of which the base is towards the shore, on which a number of rocky heads uncover at low water. At its south-eastern angle are the Trois-Pierres rocks, which dry 13 feet, marked by an iron beacon surmounted by a ball 17 feet above high water. A white beacon has also been placed on the Cabot rock about 8 cables West from the Trois-Pierres beacon, and another on the rocks extending from Neville point, these beacons being intended to facilitate the navigation of the Hedouin channel, lying between the Renier flat and the shore. Basses du Renier. \u2014 Bell-buoy. \u2014 These shoals are from one to H miles north-eastward and northward of the Renier rock ; they form three distinct patches, the basse du Sud-Est with 21 feet water, basse du Centre with 15 feet, and basse du Nord-Ouest with 26 feet. A black bell-buoy is moored just westward of the 15-feet spot on the basse du Centre. The basse du Nord-Ouest is the outer danger between cape Levi and cape Barfleur ; it is about 2h miles from the shore and only 2 cables within the 20-fathoms line of soundings bordering the coast. From its shoalest spot of 26 feet, cape Barfleur lighthouse bears S.E. \\ S. rather more than 5 miles ; and, cape Levi lighthouse W. by S. | S. 4| miles. One mile E.S.E. from the shoalest part of the basse du Nord-Ouest is a small patch with 8 fathoms water ; and, as it rises precipitously from soundings of from 14 to 19 fathoms, it occasions dangerous eddies and overfalls during strong winds. The eddies caused by both the Renier and Sen shoals raise a heavy sea during a weather tide. See chart, No. 1,106,"], [449, "Chap. IX.] DANGERS NEAR CAPE BARFLEUR. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 421 The Roquette, a small isolated rocky patch of only 4 feet water, lies N. by E. f E. about I1- miles from the beacon off Neville point ; and, N. W. \u00a7 N. 3 miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse. There is another patch, with 5 fathoms, S.S.E. 2 cables from the Roquette, ' and many others lie between the Roquette and the Renier. Plateau des Equets is a rocky ridge about one mile south eastward from the Roquette, and N.W. by N. 2 miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse ; it is of a circular form, about 3 cables in diameter, and has four dangerous heads of which the highest rises from its southern part and uncovers nearly 2 feet ; there are from 2 to 5 feet on the other heads. Haut-Fond des Equets, a rocky patch of 28 feet water, with from 10 to 12 fathoms round it, lies If miles from the shore, 5^ cables northward of the plateau des Equets, and about N.N.W.

The shoalest part of the bank is about 4 cables wide, aud has three patches of from 4 to 6 feet water on which the sea breaks very heavily in bad weather during a weather tide ; this must cause the depth frequently to vary, but the body of the bank remains stationary. Directions. \u2014 Vessels of deep draught, and even small craft without pilots, should keep outside the dangers just described, which extend as far as 2h miles from the shore between cape Levi and cape Barfleur ; and the directions given for approaching Cherbourg from the eastward, at page 413, should be attended to. At night, in clear weather, bearings of the lights of Cherbourg, cape Levi, and cape Barfleur, greatly assist the mariner in avoiding these dangers, which See chart, No. 1,106,"], [450, "422 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [Chap. IX. should not be approached within a depth of 26 fathoms ; but, in thick weather, vessels should keep well off-shore, as the lead does not give sufficient warning of their proximity. Tidal Streams.\u2014 At 2\\ miles from the land between cape Levi and cape Barfleur, the flood or eastern stream commences about the time of half flood by the shore, and ends at half ebb. It attains its greatest speed at high water, and the west-going stream its greatest speed at low water by the shore. From the northern part of cape Levi race to 2 or 3 miles in the offing, the direction of both streams, during their greatest strength at springs, is East and West, and the rate of the flood is from 3^ to 4 knots, the ebb something less. Outside and amongst the Sen and Renier shoals, their direction is E.S.E. and W.N.W., and their rate about the same ; but, as the meridian of cape Barfleur is approached, the flood stream inclines more to the South-east and its strength increases. At 2 miles northward of cape Barfleur, the flood runs S.E. 5 or 6 knots ; the ebb, N.W., with nearly equal velocity ; see also Table, page 425. CAPE BARFLEUR. \u2014 Beacon. \u2014 Cape Barfleur is the north eastern extreme of the Cotentin peninsula and the western extreme of the Baie de la Seine ; it is a low point, off which in a S.E. by E. direction at about one mile, as also on its north-western side, are some rocks which uncover at low water, and eastward of it are the reefs causing the race presently described. Two towers of unequal height, about 80 feet apart, stand at the extreme of the point aud serve to mark its position by day. A red iron beacon with conical framework top-mark, 18 feet above high water, stands on a rock E. \\ S. about 4 cables from the lighthouse. LIGHT. \u2014 The highest or southern tower on cape Barfleur is the lighthouse, now officially named the Bartieur-Gatteville lighthouse ; which exhibits at 236 feet above high water a group-flashing white electric light with a period of ten seconds, showing two flashes in quick succession occupying two and a half seconds, followed by an eclipse of seven and a half seconds. The light is visible 22 miles. Fog Signal.\u2014 During thick or foggy weather, a siren established in the upper gallery of the lighthouse, worked by compressed air, gives a blast of about three seconds duration every minute, see Fog signals, page 11.

When the sun shines on these towers, the lighthouse may be seen 15 or 16 miles distant, and the Semaphore tower at 11 or 12 miles. They are difficult to distinguish when at some distance north eastward of them on account of the high land at their back ; this land, however, has a remarkable break in its formation, which assists to mark their position ;\u2014 it is the valley of the little river Saire, called Coupee du Vaast, which lies S.W. by W. 5^ miles from the lighthouse. Pernelle hill is also a remarkable object, the church on its summit attracting particular notice ; it bears S.W. by S. 4| miles from the lighthouse, and when seen from S.S.E., N.N.E., or N.N.W., the hill has the appearance of a promontory sloping gradually towards the sea. BARFLEUR RACE. \u2014 This race is occasioned by the impetuous rush of the tidal streams over the rocks forming a submarine extension of cape Barfleur. These rocks are based on the flat joining the land and extending about a mile between East and S.E. from the lighthouse, as far as the line of Pernelle and Monfarville church towers in one. They form three separate reefs ; the first, with from 7 to 25 feet water, extends E. byT N. 5 cables from the lighthouse ; the second, separated from the first by a deep called the Breche-du- Raz, has a rock with only 17 feet water lying E. \\ S. about 6^ cables from the lighthouse ; the third, named the Riden de Quenanville, is southward of the others and separated from them by another deep about 4 cables wide. This latter reef, 2 cables wide, extends 5 cables in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, and its shoalest spot of 7 feet lies with the guard-house on the summit of the eastern point of Roubaril cove touching the southern part of the highest of the houses (light keepers' dwellings), about 1\\ cables south -westward of the light house ; and Reville church spire on with the western side of a cluster of houses at the chateau de Monfarville, which chateau stands one mile southward of Barfleur church, and, being of a brown colour, contrasts strongly with the trees surrounding it. Barfleur race is especially dangerous at springs, when the streams run through at the rate of 8 or 9 knots, and, with a fresh wind, and especially with strong north-easterly gales, the sea breaks violently throughout its whole extent. The broken water in the race. See chart. No. 1,106, SO 1 1686 2D"], [452, "424 [Chap. IX. BARFLEUR RACE. however, depends generally upon the velocity and the hour of the tide, and it sometimes extends 3 or 4 miles in an easterly direction from the lighthouse. At neaps, the streams are not so strong and the race is quieter. At slack water, and with a moderate breeze, the extension of the race is only a strong rippling, and the most agitated part of it is not more than 2 or 3 cables wide. Fishermen, under these circumstances, cross it, passing through the Breche-du-Raz. Barfleur pilots also take small vessels through it at such times ; and, to do so, they only carry sufficient sail to steer well, so as to avoid the broken water and to keep the vessel's head to the sea. Vessels entering the Baie de la Seine from the westward, should avoid Barfleur race by giving the cape a berth of at least 2 miles in rough weather, and of 1^ miles in fine weather.

BAIE DE LA SEINE is the deep bight comprised between cape Barfleur and cape D'Antifer, which latter bears from the former E. by S. \u00a3 S. 55 miles. The coast of the bay recedes from this line about 24 miles towards the mouth of the river Orne ; and its circuit, excluding the shores of the Seine estuary and of the Grand Vay, is about 96 miles.* It is open to all winds from N.W. round by North to N.E., and a heavy sea is thrown into it when they blow with any strength. At springs, the tidal streams, as described at pages 466 and 506, as also in Table, page 507, run at the rate of 3 or 4 knots. All the indentations in the coast, out of the fair line of the tidal streams, are blocked up by sand and by the accumulations deposited by the rivers, and all the harbours, except Havre and Port-en-Bessin, are dry at low water, and, during neaps, there is but little water in any of them even at high water ; a vessel embayed here, therefore, during strong northerly winds is in a dangerous position. The principal headlands and harbours are well lighted, and thus distinctly marked at night ; but, unfortunately, the lights as well as the characteristics of the coast hy day, are frequently obscured by haze and fogs, which are more prevalent here than at other parts and at times prove very embarrassing. THE COAST. \u2014 From cape Barfleur, the coast trends southward 5\u00a7 miles to pointe de Saire ; it is generally low and of rocky granite * See Admiralty Charts : \u2014 North Coast of France, sheet XI., cape Levi to Fecamp.

Seen from the offing the land here appears well wooded, church steeples showing here and there above the trees. As previously mentioned, Pernelle hill and church, 3 miles north-westward of Saire point, is a conspicuous object. From Saire point, the land falls back west ward, forming at 3 miles southward of that point the Rade de la Hougue; the little ports of Barfleur, Reville, St. Vaast, and La Hougue, all lying between cape Barfleur and the Grande Rade de la Hougue. From La Hougue, the shores of the bay are generally low and sandy, with off-lying shoals and sand-banks in the western part ; but, eastward of Maisy point, it is more diversified, and, in the neighbourhood of point Percee, which bears S. by E. f E. 22| miles from cape Barfleur, are high chalk cliffs visible 12 or 15 miles distant. The ports of Carentan and Isigny are in the deep bight of the Grand Vay, westward of point Maisy. From point Percee, point Beuzeval, the southern boundary of the estuary of the Seine, bears S.E. by E. \u00a7 E. 34 miles, the intervening coast, described here after in detail, consisting partly of cliffs of chalk or of rock and brown clay, and partly of low sand-hills with a moderately high and well cultivated interior. The ports within this space are, Port-en - Bessin, Courseulles, Oyestreham, and Caen, the latter 9 miles above Oyestreham on the river Orne, and the river Dives just westward of Beuzeval hill. From Beuzeval point, the white chalk cliffs of cape de la Heve bear N.E. N. 13 miles, the whole intervening space being occupied by the shallows, banks, and channels of the Seine estuary, on the southern shore of which is the harbour of Trouville, and the port of Honfleur ; whilst, on the northern shore, is the large and important port of Havre. The river Seine is navigable for large vessels as high as Rouen. From cape de la Heve, the chalk cliffs forming the coast line trend almost directly N.E. f N. 11^ miles to cape D'Antifer, the shore being safe of approach within one mile for the whole distance between the two capes but without port or harbour of any description. SOUNDINGS. \u2014 The depths in the Baie de la Seine are very regular, varying, in line between cape Barfleur and cape D'Antifer, from 24 fathoms near the former to 18 fathoms near the latter, and from those depths decreasing very gradually towards the off-lying See chart, No. 2,613"], [456, "[Chap.

It marks the position of the wreck of the Cubana, a ship which foundered in the year 1862, and is maintained in position not that the wreck is any longer a danger to navigation, but for the safety of the trawls and nets of fishermen. The buoy should, according to rule, be coloured green, but is nevertheless as described. PORT BARFLEUR.* \u2014 The entrance to this little port bears S. | W. 1^ miles from cape Barfleur lighthouse, and its position is clearly indicated by the church, with its square tower and no spire, standing on the northern point of entrance. The port is only 3 cables long and 2 cables wide, is sheltered by the land from South round by West to N.N.E., and protected from the sea during strong easterly winds by the Antiquaires and other rocky beds fronting the entrance, in which are moored four warping buoys to assist vessels entering or leaving. A small stone jetty extends 53 yards in a southerly direction from the northern point of entrance, and a breakwater 220 yards long extends N.N.E. from the southern entrance point ; the head of the northern jetty bears from the outer end of the breakwater about W.N.W. 110 yards. The bottom of the port is generally mud mixed with broken shells, sand, and gravel, and is good for vessels taking the ground, but there are some rocky patches which should be avoided. Vessels not going alongside the quay should moor securely to the large iron rings fixed in the rocks, as there is a good deal of sea with easterly winds when the Antiquaires rocks are covered. Depths.\u2014 The port dries throughout at low water, springs. Vessels loading or unloading lie alongside the North quay, which is nearly 300 yards long, and where the bottom is from 4 to 8 feet above the lowest tides and the berths are soft and good ; the bottom over the rest of the port is from 4 to 10 feet above that level. Vessels of 14 feet draught can enter the harbour at springs, but it is only available for those of 6 feet at the lowest neaps. * See plan on chart Rade de la Hougue, No. 2,743."], [457, "Chap. X.] 429 PORT BARFLEUR. The port, though now connected with the general railway system, is of no commercial importance. Its trade, carried on by small coasters, is represented by about 100 vessels of an aggregate of 3,150 tons entering annually, and, of these, about half enter in ballast. Granite for building purposes is quarried in the neigh bourhood. The little traffic carried on is in flax, hemp, vegetables, fruit, butter, oysters, and fish. Dangers. \u2014 The outer danger in approaching port Barfleur is the Riden des Dents, a rocky shoal on which is a dangerous patch with only 9 feet water about a mile from the shore, and bearing E. by S. S. from Gatteville church tower. The Anglais rocks bear about N.E. by E. j E. 4 cables from the North jetty end, and the Vinberge rock, the highest head, uncovers 7 feet. The Hintar rock, E. by S. \u00a3 S. nearly 2 cables from Vinberge rock, and E.N.E. 5 cables from the breakwater end, uncovers 5^ feet ; a large iron ring is fixed on it for the convenience of vessels warping into harbour or anchor ing near it in the road. Buoys and beacons. \u2014 On the northern side of the entrance, a red buoy, with conical top-mark, is moored just southward of the Grotte rock, and two other red buoys mark the Anglais and Vinberge rocks ; a red buoy marks the Ronde rock at the entrance, it is only about 50 yards from the breakwater end, and vessels entering must pass between it and the breakwater. On the southern side are, a black buoy with staff and cylinder marking the Hintar rock, two beacons marking respectively the Raie and Grosse-Haie rocks, and a black warping buoy marking the Hoisier rock near the breakwater. There is also a third beacon marking the Fourquie rock, a short distance south-eastward of the entrance. A life-boat is stationed at port Barfleur. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed white leading lights, dioptric and of the fifth order, are exhibited from square towers, one, 23 feet above high water, on a point on the southern side of the harbour, If cables within the breakwater end ; the other, at the head of the harbour, 43 feet above high water, and bearing S.W. by W. 309 yards from the former ; both are visible 9 miles, and when in line they lead to the entrance.

The two harbour lighthouses by day, or lights by night, in line bearing S.W. by W., lead through the channel to the port between the western rocks of the Antiquaires reef and the dangers bordering the shore between cape Barfleur and the northern point of the port, leaving on the starboard hand the four red buoys already described, and on the port hand the black buoys and beacons. The channel narrows considerably between the Hintar and Anglais rocks, and, from thence to the entrance, it is only 120 yards wide. At the entrance, it is only about 50 yards wide between the Ronde buoy and the head of the breakwater. Anchorage. \u2014 Vessels arriving before high water with off-shore winds, may anchor in Barfleur road, which is a small deep between the Plateau des Antiquaires and the Gaillarde and Anglais rocks. The best anchorage is in about 5 fathoms, good holding-ground, with the lower leading light a little open to the left of the higher light, or with Pernelle and Monfarville church towers in line S.W. ; and, Crabet mill, in ruins and without sails, just open northward of Masse point. This anchorage should be used during off-shore winds only and in fine weather ; should a vessel, however, be surprised in it by strong northerly or easterly winds, she must moor with open hawse to ihe northward, and with the heaviest anchor to the east ward ; the anchorage being of small extent, it will be necessary to shorten in and tauten the cables as the water falls to prevent tailing on the rocks, Tides and tidal Steams.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port Barfleur at 8h. 59m. ; ordinary springs rise 20\u00a3 feet, neaps 16^ feet above the level of the soundings on the plan, which are about 3J feet below the level of low water, ordinary springs, see See plan on chart.

The tides are very regular, but with strong prevailing south-westerly winds the water rises higher, and, with strong and lasting winds in the opposite direction, remains lower than the general level ; this is also the case in all the harbours of the bay of the Seine. The mean duration of the rising tide is 5h. 50m., and of the falling tide 6h. 35m., but the duration of the rising tide between a neap and the following spring tide exceeds 6 hours and sometimes reaches 6\u00a3 hours, whilst between a spring and the following neap it is below the mean. The first part of the flood stream follows the direction of the shore from cape Barfleur, and crosses the road and channel. Its greatest rate does not exceed 3 knots and it decreases suddenly at about half flood, when an eddy commences in the opposite direction but with rather less speed. This eddy is weak about high water, but its rate increases as soon as the tide begins to fall. Moulard point is low and bears S. by E. \u00a3 E. 1\\ miles from Barfleur church. Rocks which uncover at low water lie off the point, and rocky ground with shoal patches extends about a mile from the shore. The Basse Orientale du Moulard is the outer or eastern patch ; it has 26 feet water, lies E. N. 8 cables from the Moulard rock beacon turret, and, from it, Crabet mill is on with the northern extreme of Filet at Barfleur. Vessels should keep a mile from the shore between Barfleur and this point whilst the Moulard rock is uncovered. Moulard rock. \u2014 Beacon turret. \u2014 The Moulard is a granite rock on which stands a white beacon turret about 2\\ cables eastward of Moulard point ; this rock uncovers 22 feet at the lowest tides, and is a useful mark to all who navigate along this part of the coast ; for, when it is covered and the sea smooth, there is water for large vessels over all the hidden dangers between cape Barfleur and La Hougue. Pointe de Saire is the first prominent point southward of cape Barfleur ; Pernelle hill rises N.W. by W. 3 miles from the point, the church on its summit forming the most remarkable object on this part of the coast. Reville battery is at the extreme of Saire point, and one of the lights used in entering La Hougue road at night is shown from its south-western face ; see page 435.

The island of Tatihou, the small Fort de 1'Ilet on the rocks close southward of that island, and the rocks which surround them, partly close the entrance to this bight ; at low water, they join the mainland by a beach of gravel, sand, and rock ; the whole of the bay from St. Vaast point to the outer rocks of the ile de Tatihou and from thence to La Hougue point being dry, or nearly so, at the lowest tides. The iles de Tatihou and de 1'Ilet may be recognized by their old but obsolete and disused fortifications. The former is used as a quarantine station for Cherbourg, the lazaretto being on its western side, and its only occupants being the officers of the quarantine establishment. The latter has no occupant. The narrow rocky peninsula of La Hougue extends one mile S.W. from St. Vaast point. Fort La Hougue occupies its southern and highest part ; near the centre of the fort and on its western side is the remarkable old round tower of La Hougue. Westward and northward of the fort is a sandy bay, one mile in depth and width, but which, at low water, dries completely out to and beyond the extreme point of La Hougue. ST. VAAST. \u2014 The town of St. Vaast has a population of about 3,000 ; its small tidal harbour is on the northern side of St. Vaast point, northward of a stone jetty extending E. N. 440 yards from the shore, with an iron lighthouse at its outer end. From South round by West to North it is sheltered by the land and by this jetty ; and, from the high sea and strong winds from the eastward, by Tatihou island. Protecting the harbour from north-easterly winds is a rough stone breakwater about 440 yards in length N.N.W. and S.S.E. The entrance to the harbour is 100 feet wide between the southern end of this breakwater and a small jetty running off in a north-easterly direction from the main jetty to protect the building and repairing slip just within it. The bottom of the harbour is a mixture of sand, gravel, and a little mud, great quantities of rock having been removed and levelled ; the berths are good alongside the quays, but farther off they are hard, the rocks being thinly covered. The quay frontage is very extensive considering the requirements of the port, being no less than 470 yards in length. Depths. \u2014 On the western side of the harbour, the bottom dries See chart.

X. 6 feet, and, on the eastern side, 4 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; at high water, ordinary springs, there are at the berths from 13 to 15 feet water, and, at the lowest neaps, 7 to 8 feet ; the harbour is, therefore, inaccessible to vessels over 12 or 14 feet draught under any circumstances. The town of St. Vaast has railway communication with Barfleur, and through Valogne, with the general system of the country. It has a fine hospital, considerable oyster and other fisheries, and its chief foreign trade is with England for coal, and with the Baltic for timber. About 800 vessels, including fishing craft and coasters, of an aggregate of 35,000 tons, enter the port annually ; the exports are chiefly fruit and cattle, but are unimportant, vessels usually leaving in ballast. The southern and principal passage to the harbour is between the rocky ridge extending southward from the jetty to La Hougue fort on the western side, and Tatihou island and the rocky ledge which extends 5 cables south-eastward of Fort de 1'Ilet and terminates in the two rocky groups named the Dent and the Gavendest, on the eastern side ; the highest head of the Dent uncovers 7 feet, and of the Gavendest 6 feet at low water.

[Chap. X. pilots may leave the harbour at high water, springs, and pass out north ward of Tatihou island, keeping about a cable from its northern shore in passing. Tides. \u2014 During the whole of the rising tide, the stream runs northward between St. Vaast jetty and Tatihou island, and, with the falling tide, it follows the same direction until the highest part of the beach joining that island to the mainland is uncovered, which is at about half ebb. With both streams, at their greatest strength, a strong eddy forms at the end of the jetty and extends over the whole harbour, and with a fresh wind from North to N.E. there is a confused sea within, though very much reduced since the construction of the breakwater. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station in fort de la Hougue, about 110 yards north-eastward of the round tower ; see page 12. PORT DE LA HOUGUE is merely a grounding place, 4 cables long and one cable wide, westward and under the ramparts of La Hougue fort, which partially shelters it from easterly winds ; the water here is generally smooth, but there is considerable sea when it blows freshly from S.S.W. round by East to N.E. It admits vessels of about 14 feet draught at high water, springs, and of 9 feet draught at neaps, but since the completion of St. vaast harbour it is quite deserted ; it might, however, afford useful shelter in bad weather to a vessel of moderate draught compelled to run ashore. The best grounding place is a cable distant from the fort, between the parallels of La Hougue tower and of the wooden storehouse at the foot of the glacis northward of the fort ; this space is bounded westward by a shallow channel which receives all the water flowing from the land. The bottom abreast of the tower dries 1\\ feet, and from thence rises gradually towards the northern part of the bay. The bottom is hard, being a mixture of muddy sand and gravel, and yields but little under vessels when aground. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in port de la Hougue at 8h. 42m. The tide rises abreast of La Hougue tower from 14 to 15 feet at springs, and from 1\\ to 8^ feet at the lowest neaps ; in the southern part, it rises 2 or 3 feet higher. Fresh winds from S.W. to West raise the tide a foot or two higher than in calm weather, and winds from N.E. to North have a contrary effect. Set chart No. 2,743."], [465, "Chap.

As already described, a black conical buoy is moored near the eastern edge of this rock. Roche Joly, the top of which uncovers 3 feet, bears W.S.W. 6\u00a3 cables from La Hougue lighthouse, and the sea breaks on it at high water in bad weather. Jean de la Dune is a small group of four rocky heads which only uncover at springs ; the highest head, awash at low water, bears S.S.W. 5 W. 7 cables from La Hougue lighthouse. The summits of Jean de la Dune, the Joly, and another rock southward of it, are the 'highest heads of the Verdieres reef, a rocky flat, lying nearly parallel with the shore, and on which there is a heavy sea with onshore winds. Both the Roche Joly and Jean de la Dune are cleared by keeping Pernelle spire a little open eastward of the Du Loup iwhite beacon, standing on the sands in port de la Hougue. RADE de la HOUGUE. \u2014 This anchorage is south-eastward of port de la Hougue, and, although the sand-banks in its vicinity are well known to be shifting, it affords good anchorage for vessels of deep draught. It extends westward as far as the spires of Reville and St. Vaast churches in line, and, eastward, as far as the Ouest- Drix flat and the northern part of the Bane de la Rade ; its northern limit is the parallel of the Dent and Gavendest rocks, both marked by red buoys ; and, its southern boundary, the small sand-bank named the Haut-fond de la Grande Rade, on which the least water is 27 feet. The holding-ground is good in almost every part of this anchorage, and vessels are well sheltered by the land from winds between S.S.W. and N.W., which are frequent and dangerous in winter ; but, it is open to winds from N.N.E. to S.S.E., which, even when moderate, send in a troublesome swell, but when blowing with any strength raise a heavy sea.

Quarantine.\u2014 Vessels suspected of having contagious diseases on board are sent from all the northern ports of France to ride out their quarantine in this roadstead, and, at times, many such may be seen at anchor in it. The lazaretto and health office being, as before stated, on the western side of Tatihou island. The Grande Rade is a small deep in the southern part of La Hougue road about 6 cables long N.E. aad S.W., and 2 cables wide, where large vessels may anchor in excellent holding-ground. The best position is in the centre of the deep in from 7 to 8 fathoms, with the church towers of Pernelle and St. Vaast in one N. by W. \\ W.; and, the Bois de la Ville midway between Quineville church tower and a guard-house on the shore. The Petite Rade is the space included between the Grande Rade and the rocks off La Hougue fort, but good holding-ground does not extend much eastward of the line of Reville light touching the south-eastern angle of Fort de 1'Ilet. Between this limit and the Grande Rade, the bottom is of sand and broken shells, and the holding-ground indifferent ; fresh easterly winds also throw in a heavy sea. Pilots anchor vessels in about 4 fathoms, good holding-ground, in the space which has the following limits : \u2014 Quetehou church tower on with La Hougue point ; Morsaline and La Hougue lighthouses in line ; and, Reville lighthouse open a little eastward of Fort de 1'Ilet. From this anchorage, vessels of moderate draught may, if necessary, run aground for refuge in port de la Hougue. If drawing over 9 feet, however, and therefore unable to enter either St. Vaast or port de la Hougue during the lowest neaps, such vessels should anchor in the northern part of La Hougue road, where they are in some degree sheltered from strong north-easterly winds and sea by Tatihou island and the rocks southward of it. Bane de la Rade. \u2014 This bank, of which the northern portion bounds the Rade de la Hougue in a south-easterly direction, is, within the 5-fathoms line, 4 miles long North and South, and, abreast of its shoalest part one mile from the northern end, 6 or 7 cables wide. There are from 11 to 15 feet on the shoalest parts ; and the northern end, where there are 18 feet close to the 5-fathoms edge, lies about a cable eastward of Reville spire on with the tower on Tatihou island ; and, with La Hougue lighthouse See chart, No. 2,743."], [467, "Chap.

Approaching La Hougue road from the northward, the mariner should take care that his vessel is not drifted southward of it by the flood stream, which, from the extreme of Barfleur race to about 3 miles off Saire point, runs southward, following the direction of the coast, at the rate of 3 knots, at springs ; close to Saire point, it changes its direction suddenly to the south-west. Vessels of deep draught should keep outside the off-lying shoal patches by attending to the marks already given for clearing them. When southward of the shoal water off Saire point, and to avoid the dangers eastward of Tatihou island, cape Barfleur lighthouse must be kept open eastward of Reville lighthouse until Morsaline and La Hougue lighthouses are in line, then steer about W.S.W. for the Grande Rade. Running in on this course near low water, cape Barfleur light will be hidden for a few moments by Tatihou tower ; directly it re-appears westward of the tower bearing N. by E. a vessel should anchor. To anchor in the northern part of La Hougue road by day or night, run in with Morsaline lighthouse just open southward of La Hougue lighthouse, in order to pass about a cable southward of the shoal patch on the Ouest-Drix, and anchor as soon as Reville light is hidden by Fort de 1'Ilet, or by the tower on Tatihou should the light be seen above the fort, which may be the case towards high water. Tidal Streams.\u2014 In the middle of La Hougue road, the stream of flood, at springs, begins about 4| hours before high water in the port, see page 436, and runs about W.S.W. It attains its greatest rate, 2\\ knots, about 2J hours before high water in the harbour, and its mean duration is 5h. 20m. The ebb stream commences about 25 minutes after high water in the port, its mean duration is 7h. 10m., its direction N.E. and E.N.E., and its greatest rate, 2\\ knots, occurs about 4h. 20m. after high water.

They are but little above the level of high water, but the fort, and especially the large case-mated tower on the highest point of ile du Large, the eastern island, may be seen from 9 to 12 miles distant. These islands, distinguished by the names ile du Large and ile de Terre, are separated by a narrow channel, through which the tidal streams run with great rapidity ; a coasting vessel having missed La Hougue road, with a strong north-westerly wind and flood tide, may anchor during the remainder of the flood in a small bight, named Mannette, on the southern shore of ile de Terre, provided she is moored securely and steadied by a hawser to the shore, for the eddies formed by the points of that island occasion a heavy sea.

Both banks consist of large masses of sand and broken shells, the Bane de St. Marcouf having from 7 to 12 feet on its shoalest parts. The tides cross them obliquely, and occasion strong eddies even in calm weather, and with easterly winds or northerly gales the sea breaks violently upon both banks from half ebb to half flood.

Local authorities state that a well-found vessel might ride out a heavy gale from the north-eastward in this channel, under shelter of the high parts of the Cardonnet, the St. Marcouf, or the Rade banks, which break the violence of the sea ; it is, however, but precarious shelter, and should only be resorted to as a last resource when a vessel is embayed and finds it impossible to gain an offing, for the sea in such weather is sure to be very heavy in the channel between the banks on the flood, and a breaking sea is caused by the weather tide on the ebb. If a vessel is obliged to bring up in this channel, such an anchorage should be chosen, that in case she parts or is compelled to run ashore, she may do so where there is some chance of safety for the crew. The Magdeleine bank at the entrance of the Grand Vay should be carefully avoided, as it is of hard sand, and a vessel running on it in bad weather would certainly go to pieces.

The direction of the flood through La Hougue road is W.S.W. ; at the northern end of St. Marcouf bank, S.W. by W. ; round the iles St. Marcouf, S.S.W. ; on the middle of the Cardonnet bank, South ; and, about a mile eastward of the end of that bank, S.E. In mid-channel, however, the flood stream runs nearly parallel with the shore from the Rade de la Hougue as far as the meridian of the iles St. Marcouf, it then turns S.S.W. towards the entrance of the Grand Vay, beyond which it again See charts, Nos. 2,743 and 2,073."], [471, "Chap.

The ebb is rather weaker than the flood and at each position given runs nearly in an opposite direction. At neaps, both streams are feeble except at the entrance of the Grand Vay. GRAND VAY.\u2014 The shore is flat and for the most part com posed of sand-hills from port de la Hougue to the entrance of the Grand Vay, which is an indentation of the coast in the south-western part of the Baie de la Seine ; it is about 4 miles wide and 5 miles deep, and at its head are the small tidal harbours of Carentan and Isigny. The entrance to this deep bight is about 5 milos south ward of the iles St. Marcouf ; it is choked with sand and would probably cease to be navigable but for the extensive harbour works and the periodical freshets from the small rivers Taute and Douve on its western shore, and Vire and Aure on its eastern shore, whose channels afford sufficient depth for vessels of moderate draught to reach Isigny and Carentan at high tides. Formerly the tide flowed far into the interior, inundating the low lands bordering the rivers ; to remedy this, dikes were constructed at the mouth of each river with flood gates at the upper ends of the harbours, which close with the rising tide. The church of Ste. Marie du Mont stands con spicuously 2^ miles from the western shore, and the fine church spire at Maisy and the village and church at Grand Camp serve to mark clearly the eastern side of the entrance to the Grand Vay. Magdeleine bank. \u2014 The entrance to the Grand Vay is more than half closed by the Magdeleine bank, which uncovers at low water 2J miles from the western shore and is a continuation of the sandy strand, 5 cables wide, bordering the shore from port de la Hougue southward. The highest parts of this bank are scarcely covered at high water, neaps, and it is considered the most dangerous of the Grand Vay banks, for the streams cross it with great rapidity, and raise a heavy sea on a weather tide. The sand also of which it is composed is so hard that a\u00abvessel grounding on it in bad weather would have but little chance. Bell-buoys. \u2014 A large red bell-buoy with conical top-mark is moored off the northern edge of the shoal in about 17 feet water at the entrance of the Carentan channel. Another large bell-buoy, red and black with spherical top-mark, is moored in 10 feet water at the entrance to the Isigny channel ; it bears S.E. easterly 2\u00a3 miles from the first buoy described.

CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. 444 The Bane de la Ravine is an extension of Brevand point, dividing the lower courses of the rivers Taute and Vire. It extends as far northward as the parallel of Maisy point, its summit barely covered at spring tides and the greater part of its surface dry during neaps. The greater part of the space between Maisy point and this bank is occupied by shifting sands ; that named the Feraillon, on the western side of the Isigny channel, is the only one that does not change its surface, being covered with gravel, beneath which there is said to be solid rock. There is little danger in grounding on the sands within the Grand Vay with smooth water during the dry summer season, for the tides then have but little strength ; but, during abundant rains or with equinoctial tides, the ebb stream is very strong and heaps up the sand under vessels aground, causing them to list over and capsize. MAISY POINT, the eastern point of the Grand Vay, is very low, but defended against the heavy sea which sometimes rolls in by the Roches de Grand Camp, a ledge fronting the coast and extending H miles westward and 2| miles eastward of the point. Buoys.\u2014 The Roches de Grand Camp are marked by four black buoys moored from 2\\ to 5 cables outside their outer edge.

Capelle road. \u2014 There is good anchorage off the entrance of the Grand Vay in Capelle road, where, in moderate weather, vessels may remain unil the tide has risen sufficiently to allow of their entering the narrows. This anchorage, about a mile in extent, is bounded westward by the line of Carentan church tower on with the eastern houses of Grand Vay hamlet ; eastward, by the rocky bottom which terminates in the direction of the small fort near the shore on with Maisy spire bearing S. \\ W. % and, northward, by the high land of Menil, which rises eastward of Port-en-Bessin, on with point Percee ; the latter mark also leads outside the rocky ledge and dangers off Grand Camp.

The most favourable time for entering the narrows is about 1| hours before high water, but, with a head wind, it is prudent to weigh in time to arrive abreast of Grouin point, on the eastern shore of the Grand Vay, before the commencement of the ebb. CARENTAN, on the river Taute, about 9 miles from the entrance and on the western side of the Grand Vay where the Vire and Taute canal terminates, has a tidal harbour with a Bassin-a-flot or wet dock at its head. The Bassin-a-flot is entered by a lock 136 feet long, 40 feet wide, and with 13 feet 6 inches over the sill at high water, ordinary springs ; it is nearly 1,600 yards in length and varies from 60 to 120 yards in width, its shores thickly planted with trees until near the town, at the upper end, where are 265 yards of substantial stone quay frontage ; the quays communicating by well paved roads with the railway station about 400 yards distant. From the entrance of the Bassin-a-flot, dikes awash at high water, neaps, at all their outer part, like those of Isigny, the success of which led to the construction of these, extend no less than 7,000 yards, terminating abreast of the little village of Grand Vay. The width between these dikes is, at the entrance, 132 yards, narrowing to 71 yards near the upper end. Depths. \u2014 The bottom of the channel is far above the level of low water, and the depth varies considerably, but practically the port is available for vessels of 13 feet draught at springs, but only for those of 7 or 8 feet at neaps. The Carentan channel receives the waters of the Vire and Taute canal as well as of the rivers Taute and Douve, and its depth is only maintained by the extensive modern embankments assisted by the scour of these united streams. Entering from seaward, the channel commences near the western bell-buoy, described at page 443, and is well marked on either side for nearly 3 miles up to the dike-ends by numerous buoys, and the dike-ends and the whole of their submersible parts are marked by beacons at short intervals ; red buoys and beacons being left on the starboard hand in entering, black buoys and beacons on the port hand, as usual. From the changeable character of the channel, both as regards direction and depth, it is dangerous, under any circumstances, to attempt it without pilot. The town of Carentan contains about 3,000 inhabitants and is the See chart, No. 2,073."], [474, "[Chap. X. 446 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. centre of a fertile grazing district ; it was formerly a fortress, but its ramparts have been levelled and ditches filled in. It has a handsome church and spire, manufactures of lace and cotton goods, and a trade in cattle, horses, hemp, flax, butter, building materials, &c. Besides its coasting trade, the chief traffic is with Southampton and with Norway and Sweden. It is on the direct Paris and Cherbourg railway, and therefore has ample means of communication with all parts of the country. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed leading lights on wooden scaffoldings are exhibited as a guide through the channel of Carentan ; viz., a red light on the sea bank 16 feet, and a white light at Brevand 49 feet, above high water ; the ivhite light is distant 940 yards S. 46\u00b0 W. from the red light, and is visible 7 miles ; the red light' being visible 9 miles. The lights show through an arc of 32\u00b0, their maximum intensity being when in line, which is the leading mark for the channel. ISIGNY, on the eastern side and 6 miles from the entrance of the Grand Vay, also has the benefit of direct railway communication ; it stands on the river Aure which joins the Vire just below the town, both rivers being guided to the point of junction between dikes, and, from thence, in one channel in a N. by E. direction, also between rough stone dikes, their inner ends above the level of the highest tides and their outer parts awash at high water, neaps. The eastern dike extends 3,046 yards, the western dike being more than 600 yards longer and ending abreast of and about If cables from Grouin point. The width between the dikes at the entrance is 102 yards, and it narrows to 92 yards at their inner end ; their whole tidal length is marked at short intervals by beacons, red on the star board hand and black on the port hand in entering. At the town the width between the quays is only 90 feet, except where a gare has been made where vessels can be turned round ; there is an old stone quay 85iyards in length, and also one of recent construction 220 yards in length; there are also two small unloading slips, as well as building and repairing slips. The staple of the town is butter, of which a large quantity is exported annually, also grain, colza oil, and stone. The population is about 3,000, and the trade is represented by the entry of about 130 small vessels annually, of an aggregate of about 9,000 tons. The high road from Paris to Cherbourg passes through Isigny, as does also the railway from Grand Camp to Paris and Cherbourg. See chart, No. 2,073."], [475, "Chap. X.] ISIGNY. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 COAST. 447 Depths. \u2014 As at Carentan, the bottom of the channel is far above the low water level. The harbour is available for vessels of 13 feet draught, at springs, and 7 or 8 feet at neaps ; the berths alongside the quays are good. The depth is reported to have rather increased since the completion of the dikes and embankments, the silting up during the summer, when there is but little water in the Aure, being more than counterbalanced by the scour of the freshets occasioned periodically by heavy rains. Vessels may lighten, if necessary, during neaps, at Grouin or Beuzeville before proceeding up to Isigny. The Passe d'lsigny, between the western end of the Roches de Grand Camp and the Feraillon bank, is the channel leading from the sea to the dike-heads and thence to Isigny. It is well marked by buoys and beacons as far as Grouin point, from whence, as before stated, the submersible dikes between which the channel then lies are also marked by beacons at short intervals up to Isigny. The distance from abreast of the inner black buoy of the Roches de Grand Camp to the dike-ends is nearly 3 miles. LIGHTS. \u2014 There are at Isigny two fixed white leading lights, bearing N. by E. and S. by W. from each other, and 656 yards apart. They are respectively 26 and 62 feet above high water, and visible 9 and 12 miles for 18\u00b0 on each side of the axis of the channel. The lower light is shown from a wooden gibbet at the point of junction of the Aure and Vire rivers, the upper light from a metal mast farther inland ; the two lights in line lead up the channel between the dikes. Tides and tidal Streams. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Isigny at 9h. 10m. Pilots estimate the depth by deducting 6| feet from the height of tide given in the \"Annuaire des Marees a Cherbourg.\" The flood stream, at springs, loses its strength when the Grand Vay banks are covered. It crosses the Magdeleine bank with some rapidity until 3^ or 4 hours flood, and inclines towards the inner banks, which renders the entrance to the channel some what difficult with a head wind. The beginning of the ebb is weak, but as soon as the banks begin to uncover its rate rapidly increases. At Isigny, both streams run strongly in the river Vire but are scarcely preceptible in the river Aure. The COAST. \u2014 From point Maisy, on the eastern side of the entrance to the Grand Vay, to point Percee, the distance is 5| miles, See chart, No. 2,073."], [476, "[Chap. X. 448 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. the general trend of the coast being about E. by S. \\ S. ; a mile east ward of Grand Camp church, the land suddenly rises and a perpen dicular chalk cliff about 400 feet high commences, which may be seen 12 or 15 miles off. The land above the cliff is level and without any conspicuous object on it except the church of St. Pierre du Mont, which stands in the midst of a clump of high trees. From point Percee, cape Manvieux bears S.E. by E. \\ E. 1H miles, the little harbour of Port-en-Bassin lying between them ; and, nearly as far as St. C6me-de-Fresne chapel, 1^ miles eastward of cape Manvieux, the land as seen from the offing appears nearly a level plain upwards of 400 feet above the sea, overtopped only by the church towers and groups of trees surrounding the villages. When nearer the coast, it presents a great variety of aspect ; the chalk cliffs continue to about a mile south-eastward of point Percee, and, from thence as far as the guard-house at Ste. Honorine, the high table-land recedes somewhat from the coast, the shore being low, sandy, and bounded by low sand-hills, in front of which is a beach of muddy sand and shingle about 2 or 3 cables wide at low water. Between Ste. Honorine guard-house and St. C6me-de-Fresne chapel, the shore is again precipitous, consisting of high cliffs of rock and brown clay intersected by narrow valleys, of which some are as deep as the level of high-water mark, but the greater part are only half the depth of the cliffs. Vessels of deep draught may approach to within a mile of the shore between point Percee and cape Manvieux without danger. Eastward of the chapel of St. C6me-de-Fresne, the appearance of the coast changes from cliffs of rock and brown clay to gracefully undulating hills, richly cultivated, and rising with a gentle slope behind the shore as far as the left bank of the river Orne. From cape Manvieux to the Semaphore of St. Aubin-Bernieres near St. Aubin point, a distance of 8^ miles, the coast trends E. by S. | S. ; and, from thence, S.E. t\\ E. 7 miles to the mouth of the Orne at Oyestreham. In the vicinity of Courseulles, the entrance to which is If miles westward of the Semaphore of St. Aubin-Bernieres, the coast again consists of low sand-hills, except in front of the village of St. Aubin, where its direction begins to trend more south eastward. The highest reefs of the Plateau de Calvados adjoin the shore along this coast-line eastward of cape Manvieux, rendering a near approach to it dangerous. The different localities may be recognised See charts, Nos. 2,073 and 1,821."], [477, "Chap. X.] COAST. \u2014 GRAND CAMP. \u2014 PORT-EN-BESSIN. 449 from seaward by the clumps of trees surrounding the villages and by the church towers appearing above them. Tailleville hill, south eastward of Courseulles, is remarkable, as is also the hill at Amfre ville on the eastern bank of the Orne, not far from the mouth of that river. Between the low water rocks in front of most of the villages along the coast, there exist small deposits of muddy sand and gravel, called Anneaux, which afford no shelter with northerly winds, but where, at the commencement of the fine season, the villagers fit out large fishing-boats of from 8 to 10 feet draught, when laden. During the winter, these boats remain either at Courseulles or in the Orne. Between St. Aubin point and the river Orne, as far as Lyon, the coast is rather high ; in other parts it consists chiefly of sand-hills. Grand Camp is a little village on the shore between point Maisy and Criqueville and is backed by a low hill ; its position is marked at night by the small fixed white light described at page 444. It has railway communication with Isigny and is an important fishing station ; its people, principally fishermen and sailors, fit out thirty or forty good-sized fishing-boats which lie under the lee of a small breakwater of rough stones, or moored to buoys on a small sandy strand, dry throughout at low water, springs, and protected from the high sea with on-shore winds by the Grand Camp rocks. Some of the pilots for the Grand Vay reside in this village and others at iBigny. A Life-boat is stationed at Grand Camp. Point Percee is the north-eastern point of the high chalk cliffs which border the shore from about a mile eastward of Grand Camp to a mile south-eastward of point Percee. The point projects but little and is remarkable only from the change in the direction of the coast-line. A flat of sand and gravel, divided into several parallel banks, extends about 8 cables E.N.E. from the point ; the eddies occasioned by these banks, which lie across the tidal streams, cause a slight race on a weather tide, but it is not dangerous to decked vessels. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on point Percee. See page 12. PORT-EN-BESSIN is 7 miles eastward of point Percee ; it is at the opening of one of the most considerable of the valleys which See chart, No. 2,073."], [478, "[Chap. X. 450 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. intersect the high cliffs of rock and brown clay on this part of the coast. The opening is about 130 yards wide between the cliff of Huppain on the West and of Castel on the East. Within the opening, the valley suddenly widens and forms a circular plain more than a mile in diameter, of which the level is from 15 to 20 feet above high water ; it is almost entirely surrounded by gently sloping hills. Depths, &C. \u2014 Fronting the valley is a steep gravel beach, which when the sea is smooth, affords a good grounding place for fishing boats ; and fronting the beach is a break in the rocks which border the shore, forming a natural basin, 140 yards wide and 2 cables long, with sand and gravel bottom, dry at low water but having 21 feet in it at high water, springs, and 18 feet at neaps. Between 1845 and 1860, no less than \u00a31,000,000 was expended in the attempt to trans form this small natural basin into a harbour of refuge. Two massive moles, their bases 550 yards apart, extend from the shore, their ends curving towards each other and leaving an opening about 110 yards wide, with 27 feet water in the entrance at high water, springs, and 24 feet at neaps. The western mole is 500 yards in length, the eastern mole 35 yards less. Several mooring buoys are laid down within this space, but, with northerly winds, in weather when a vessel would require refuge, the sea is so high and the surf so great that it would not only be most dangerous to run for this harbour, but very unsafe for any vessel already in it. The village of Bessin has a population of about 1,200, it is con nected with the city of Bayeux, about 6 miles distant, by road, and, through it, with the general railway system ; it has a large fishery but its coasting and other trade is insignificant ; a few small vessels of about 150 tons arrive annually during the fine season with coal from England and timber from the Baltic, and sail again in ballast. At low water, abundant springs of fresh water issue from apertures in the rocks which dry at that time. A Life-boat is stationed at Port-en-Bessin. LEADING LIGHTS.\u2014 A fixed white low light, visible 6 miles, is shown from a wooden gibbet under the western cliff of Port-en- Bessin at 92 feet above high water. An upper fixed light, 131 feet above high water, is exhibited from the window of a dwelling 94 yards from the low light ; the lights in line S.W. southerly lead into the harbour.

At all other times it shows white, and is visible 14 miles. The lights are visible for 18\u00b0 on each side of the leading line, and their brilliancy decreases as the distance from that line increases. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Port-en-Bessin at 8h. 57m. ; ordinary springs rise 23 feet, neaps 20 feet, above the level of the soundings, which is about 3 feet below the level of low water, ordinary springs. Tide Signals are made from a mast on the inner end of the eastern mole ; they indicate the depth within that mole. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the cliff just westward of Port-en-Bessin. See page 12. Arromanches, a pretty little fishing village used as a watering-place by the inhabitants of Bayeux, stands on the sea shore at the entrance of a wide valley three quarters of a mile east ward of cape Manvieux ; and, as it is very conspicuous from seaward, it serves to point out the position of that cape, which otherwise has little to distinguish it but its height, and the steep cliff in which it terminates. The villagers fit out small half-decked fishing vessels which, by means of capstans, they heave up a shingle beach much resembling that at Port-en-Bessin. A rocky shore, which uncovers nearly 5 cables seaward at low water, and forms a point advancing in an easterly direction from cape Manvieux, arrests the sea during northerly winds, and diminishes the violence of the surf on the beach, which is otherwise very exposed. PLATEAU de CALVADOS.\u2014 This rocky flat commences just eastward of Arromanches, and extends 13 miles eastward along the coast, as far as Lyon. The parts of the flat which uncover are, the Calvados rock, from which the name of the flat is derived ; the Roches de Ver ; the Essarts de Langrune ; and, the Roches de Lyon. A tradition exists that a forest of chestnut trees, called the forest of Hautefeuille, originally covered the rocks which dry at low water between Bernieres and Lyon, and that its destruction took place about 300 years since ; roots of chestnut trees are said to be found in the tissues of these rocks, and they are so difficult to extract, and the wood so hard, that it blunts the best tools.

It is about 5 cables long W.N.W. and E.S.E., and 3 cables wide ; its western part is highest, and uncovers 3 feet above the lowest tides. The chapel on with the spire of Bazanville church, which stands on the top of the hills 2 miles inland, bearing South, leads 3 cables westward. The north-western angle of the Plateau de Calvados bears N.E. by E. one mile from the western edge of the Calvados rock ; it is steep-to, and, from this point, preserves a distance of from 1\\ to 2\\ miles from the shore as far as Essarts point, the north-eastern extreme of the flat, which lies 3 cables westward of Langrune and Douvres church spires in line bearing S.S.W. \\. W. westerly ; with Ver lighthouse bearing West, northerly ; and, Oyestreham Semaphore, at the entrance of the river Orne, S.S.E. \\ E. easterly. From Essarts point, which is 2\\ miles from the shore, the edge of the flat turns sharply southward, and, approaching the coast within a mile, continues at that distance until it is lost beneath the drying sands westward of the mouth of the river Orne. Essarts point is the most dangerous part of the plateau, having on it only 4 feet water and rising suddenly from a depth of 20 feet ; it occasions a change in the direction of the tidal streams and causes a race, during springs, on a weather tide. There is but little water on all parts of the flat, and, the rocks being uneven, a heavy sea breaks on them with strong northerly winds. Buoys. \u2014 A black buoy is moored 5 cables N.N.W. from the north western angle of the Plateau de Calvados and rather more than one mile from the western edge of the Calvados rock. A red bell-buoy is moored in 7 fathoms N.E. by E. one mile from Essarts point, with Langrune and Douvres spires in line ; and, the outer black buoy at the entrance of the Oyestreham channel S.S.E. f E. 5| miles. Caution. \u2014 Both these buoys being in so exposed a position, are very liable to drift, and therefore the mariner should be on his guard.

X.] PLATEAU DE CALVADOS. \u2014 POINTE DE VER LIGHT. 453 side of the Calvados flat. The best position in which to anchor is in about 20 feet water, with Crepon church tower seen between those of Mevaisnes and Asnelles ; and, the tall spire of Bernieres on with the houses of Ver hamlet nearest to Ver lighthouse ; this anchorage is exposed to all but off-shore or moderate easterly winds. The soundings deepen rather suddenly outside the Calvados flat ; but there is no good anchorage ground at less than a mile from its deep western edge, or than 2 miles from its eastern edge. Directions. \u2014 Vessels of deep draught may approach to within about a mile of the shore, even at low water, between point Percee and cape Manvieux, but it is imprudent to stand in so near with northerly winds. Coasters keeping close in, with off-shore winds, should be on their guard against the gusts which proceed from the valleys. Good holding-ground may be found at 2 or 3 miles from the shore, in 9 or 10 fathoms, where vessels sometimes anchor to await the turn of tide. The tidal streams follow nearly the direction of the shore, and their greatest strength, at springs, does not exceed 3| knots. In approaching Essarts point of the Calvados flat from the eastward, keep northward of the lines of Ver church tower on with the Bois des Epines bearing W. \u00a3 S., until Langrune and Douvres spires are in line S.S.W. W. westerly. The Bois des Epines consists of a few large elms, is very conspicuous, and being used as a landmark, is carefully preserved by the local authorities. It is nearly a quarter of a mile inland, at the foot of the hills between Ver lighthouse and the Chateau de Vaux. In rounding Essarts point from the eastward, keep Lyon church tower open westward of the western house of St. Aubin-d'Arquenay village, bearing about South, until the line of Langrune and Douvres spires in one is crossed. LIGHT. \u2014 Pointe de Ver lighthouse stands 800 yards inland on the slope of a small hill 4| miles eastward of cape Manvieux and 10^ miles westward of the entrance to the river Orne ; it is a square tower from which is exhibited at 138 feet abo\\e high water a fixed and flashing white light ; the fixed light being varied by a flash every four minutes -, the flash is preceded and followed by a short eclipse which is not total when within 6 miles. The light is dioptric, of the third order, and is visible 18 miles. By day, Ver lighthouse may be easily recognised in approaching it from eastward or westward ; but, from the northward, it is difficult See charts, Nos. 2,073 and 1.821."], [482, "[Chap. X. 454 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. to distinguish on account of the high land behind it. The light was established to give warning of approach to the Calvados flat ; but with southerly winds it is very useful to vessels from the westward, bound to Havre, who, after passing cape Barfleur, sight this light, if possible, 9 or 12 miles distant, and, from thence, steer for the lights on cape de la Heve, which are then soon made. By this means they avoid making the land too far northward of Havre and the consequent delay in entering their port. COURSEULLES. \u2014 This small tidal harbour, 2\\ miles eastward of Ver lighthouse and %\\ miles westward of Oyestreham near the entrance of the river Orne, is in fact the channel through which the waters of the river Seulle are conducted, intercepted by a dam which forms the head of the inner harbour or Bassin-a-flot, in which they are retained or discharged at pleasure by means of sluices into the outer harbour, and from thence through the channel to sea. The entrance channel is above the low water level and lies between two wooden jetties running nearly parallel with each other ; the western jetty is 196 yards in length, the eastern jetty not quite so long. The width between them is only 122 feet at their outer end and 90 feet at their inner end. The sand-bank on the western side of the entrance channel is awash at high water, neaps, and prevents access to the western jetty-head, except by the channel itself. It is, however, very steep towards the channel, so that if a vessel grounds upon it in entering, she has no difficulty in hauling off again with a rising tide. A low stone dike extends 325 yards from the eastern jetty-head in the same direction as the jetty ; it serves to confine the stream and thus to maintain the direction and depth of the channel. This dike covers at 12 feet rise ; it is marked by a broom beacon, 82 yards beyond the end, and by two black buoys, one at its end, the other on the dike, about 140 yards from the jetty-head.

At the inner end of the jetties is the outer harbour, a mere widening of the channel between rough stone embankments, with numerous sets of berth ing piles and extensive quays averaging 60 feet in width. The outer harbour is 635 yards long with a maximum width of only 49 yards. At its head is the entrance to the inner harbour or Bassin-a-flot, which is by a single pair of flood-gates, with a depth over the sill of 14 feet at high water, springs, and 9\u00a3 feet at neaps ; and, a width of 32 feet. Its length is 320 yards, and width 6H yards ; on its western side, a slip occupies a space of 158?? yards. The depth in the Bassin-a-flot is about 14 feet 6 inches at high water, springs, and is lowered to about 10 feet at low water by the sluices before mentioned. It also has ample quay accommodation of very solid construction. Courseulles has the advantage of direct railway communication with Caen through the little town of Luc, a thriving watering place between Courseulles and Oyestreham, and, from thence, with the general system of France. Its trade, however, with the exception of a rather extensive fishery, is small, its imports being coal and Baltic timber, and its exports nil. The total annual tonnage entering the port, including a few small steamers, is about 28,000 tons.

Vessels should remain outside the plateau de Calvados or in the anchorage of the Fosse de Courseulles until half an hour or three quarters of an hour before high water, as they will then be able to steer direct for the entrance channel, and will have nothing to fear from the Marguerite or Germain rocks. If the wind should be off the land, half an hour longer may be required for warping in. For the deepest water, with a heavy sea, vessels may run for the harbour either between the Germain rock, which uncovers 4 feet, and the Essarts de Bernieres ; or, between the Ver rocks and the Germain.

In running for the harbour from the western side, however, it is better to pass eastward of the Vallette rock by bringing Beny spire on with a little mound on which there is a small battery, a cable eastward of the eastern jetty, bearing S. \\ E. ; this leads directly towards a small red buoy, moored about 2^ cables south-westward of the Marguerite rock, which rock is awash at low water, and, with another small rock almost awash and 100 yards westward of it, marks the south-western extreme of the shelf of rock separating the Fosse de Courseulles from the Anneau de la Marguerite. Anchorage. \u2014 In ordinary weather, small vessels may find safe anchorage either in the Anneau de la Marguerite in about 16 feet, or in the Fosse de Courseulles in from 2\\ to 3^ fathoms, good holding-ground. Those unable to enter Courseulles harbour against a strong ebb tide may also, in fine weather, safely ground in the channel and await the next tide.

ORNE RIVER.\u2014 The river Orne has its source near Seez, and from thence it trends in a north-vvesterly direction until it enters the department of Calvados, where it turns to N. by E. in passing Caen ; here it becomes navigable, and, 9 miles below See chart, No. 1,821."], [485, "Chap. X.] 457 ORNE RIVER.\u2014 CAEN. that town, finds its way into the sea between the sand-hills of Siege and Merville points, nearly 10 miles eastward of Courseulles and more than a mile eastward of Oyestreham church. At low water, the river formally ran by winding channels through the wide expanse of sand which dries 2 miles out from the shore at the entrance. To obtain a greater depth of water, a submersible dike, marked by beacons, was constructed, commencing just inside Merville point and extending 1\\ miles in a north-westerly direction outside Siege point to a position about 1^ cables north-eastward of the pier-heads of Oyestreham, and from thence a farther distance of 4^ cables N. by E. | E., thus confining the stream to one channel, which, turning sharply round Siege point, flows between the land and the dike for its whole length north-westward, and then to the sea in front of Oyestreham. This channel, therefore, forms the entrance to Oyestreham and also to the river Orne itself ; but, since the construction of the canal from Oyestreham to Caen, the navigation by the river to that city, except by the small Havre passenger steamers. has been entirely abandoned and needs no further notice, though vessels of 8 or 9 feet draught may still use it. The sand-banks off the entrance are shifting and change their height, shape, and position almost every tide, rendering it most imprudent to venture in without a pilot ; for, to ground on them would almost always involve the loss of the vessel. The parts least subject to change are those near low-water mark ; they are always covered during neaps and only uncover a short time at springs. The banks formed on this part of the shore are named by the pilots baltures, and, with strong northerly winds, there is a heavy sea on them on the flood and breakers on the ebb. The Oiseaux, the high banks on the western side of the entrance, have a decided tendency to extend eastward, thus slowly forcing the entrance channel in that direction. CAEN is 9 miles from the sea by the river, and 1\\ miles by the canal ; it is at the confluence of the rivers Orne and Odon. is on the Paris and Cherbourg railway, and is a place of great importance, with an increasing trade, and a population of about 45,000. It may be considered a double port, having its wet dock or Bassin-a-flot entered by the Oyestreham canal, and its natural tidal grounding harbour in the bed of the river Orne, which also has an entrance into the Bassin-a-flot, and some quay frontage but little used \u25a0See chart, No. 1,821. 2 F2 SO 11886"], [486, "[Chap. X. 458 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. now. The Bassin-a-flot is rectangular, is entered from the canal by a lock 40 feet wide at the gates, is 622 yards in length by 55 yards in width, and has a general depth of 15 feet. It has good quays, steam cranes, and two careeuing slips for small vessels, but no dry dock. It communicates with an inner basin with 1,350 yards of quays, on which rails are laid, and vessels unload direct into railway trucks. The Canal de Caen is entered from Oyestreham harbour by a lock, at high water, as described on the following page, and is about 1\\ miles in length to the lock at Caen. It has a uniform central depth, maintained by dredging, of 16 feet 6 inches ; it is crossed by three swing bridges, and its available width for navigation is limited by the narrowest bridge opening, which is 49 feet 8 inches -wide. The regulations for the navigation of the canal prescribe that vessels leaving Caen for the sea, shall, whenever necessary, moor to allow those arriving to pass freely. Coals may be obtained with facility, though not often required, at from 16s. to 18s. per ton, about 3,000 tons being usually in stock. There is, however, a deficiency of general supplies for shipping, and also of store accommodation, considering the growing trade of the port ; and, facilities for repairs of machinery are very limited. The hospital of the Hotel Dieu is open to sailors in case of illness or accident, a small fee only being required. In the year 1895, 605 vessels of an aggregate of 183,000 tons, of which number nine-tenths were steamers and three-fourths were British, arrived at Caen. This number includes a line of packets from Newhaven which only commenced running this year. The imports are chiefly coal and timber ; the exports, iron ore, colza oil cake, eggs, butter, fruit, &c.

The tidal basin is 320 yards long and 100 yards wide, but the bottom is hard See chart. No. 1,821."], [487, "Chap.

At its head is a lock 328 feet long, with 23 feet over the outer sill, and 54 feet wide, by which vessels bound for Caen enter the canal at high water. The tidal basin has for its entrance from seaward, a channel 44 yards wide, between two wooden jetties of unequal length, opening into a wider outer channel between submersible dikes. The western jetty is the longest ; it extends from the tidal basin about 440 yards, and is thence prolonged seaward in a N. by E. \\ E. direction a farther distance of 1,100 yards by a submersible dike running nearly parallel with that forming the eastern side of the channel, and described at page 457, the width of the channel at their outer ends being about 250 yards, and at their inner ends only about 200 yards. Both dikes are marked by beacons at their outer ends and by others at intervals to show their position when covered. The eastern jetty is about 300 yards in length. From the outer ends of the submersible dikes to the edge of the sands, the channel has a constant tendency to move eastward, so that, in 1895, the deepest water up to the entrance was in an E.N.E. direction from these dikes. Depths. \u2014 The entrance channel is very liable to change both in depth and direction, but vessels of 17 feet draught can generally enter at high water, springs, though at the lowest neaps it is only safely accessible to those of about 9 feet draught. Vessels of 14 or 15 feet draught can proceed through the lock and canal to Caen as already described. Buoyage. \u2014A red spindle buoy is moored in 3^ fathoms, out side the edge of the sands, N.N.E. 1\\ miles from the western jetty head. Two red buoys mark, the southern side of a bank, which dries 9 feet, formed immediately off the eastern dike end, and only a cable from it. A black buoy also is moored N.E. by E. -\\ E. 7 cables from the end of the East dike. Other buoys are placed and moved as may be necessary in consequence of the shifting nature of the sands in the channel leading in to Oyestreham harbour. Pilots. \u2014 There are several pilots at Oyestreham ; they may always be found in the neighbourhood of the outer red spindle buoy, and will meet a vessel much farther out if the pilot signal is made.

RADE de CAEN, about 3 miles distant between North and N.N.W. from Oyestreham jetties, affords good anchorage in from 4 to 5Jy fathoms, with off-shore winds, for vessels waiting tide to enter the harbour, but it would be dangerous to be caught there by strong winds from the opposite direction. The eastern limit of the road is the meridian of Oyestreham battery; its northern limit, Bernieres spire on with the houses on St. Aubin point ; and, its southern limit, Bernieres spire on with the small church tower at St. Aubin. Pilots usually place large vessels between these limits in about 5^ fathoms water, with Luc church tower open half a point southward of Beny spire ; here, they can weigh and stand off-shore if the wind should veer to the northward. THE RIVER DIVES.\u2014 Depths.\u2014 The entrance to this river is about 6^ miles eastward of Oyestreham, the intermediate coast consisting of sand-hills or dunes, several of which are sufficiently high to be recognised 5 or 6 miles distant. A sandy strand, 5 cables wide at low water, borders the shore, and the waters of the Dives run out across it ; but, in front of the entrance, it now dries for about a mile. Attempts have been made, with partial success, \u2022 by means of a submersible dike to confine and deepen the channel, which trends N. E. about 5 cables from the entrance and then inclines more easterly as far as the outer edge of the sand. In fine weather and with no swell, the river admits vessels of 11 or 12 feet draught, at springs, and 7 feet at neaps ; the shoalest part of the entrance channel is about 8 feet above the level of the lowest tides, but, with much fresh water in the river, it becomes temporarily deeper. At the outer edge of the sand, the water deepens abruptly, and, with strong winds between North and South, this causes a heavy sea at the entrance on the flood, and breakers as soon as the ebb stream begins to gain strength. The grounding places within the entrance are well sheltered by Cabourg point. Vessels here are safe, but the bottom is hard and unyielding. Those that only remain one tide are placed on the left See chart, No. 1,821."], [490, "[Chap. X. 462 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. bank of the river ; those that take in or discharge cargo, alongside a small quay or near the steep bank of the Mauvais-Pas, at the foot of the Balise de Dives, a hillock near the entrance. The little harbour of Dives is by nature much better calculated to make a really good harbour than any of those previously described in the Baie de la Seine. It has also railway connection eastward and with ihe interior, but its trade is entirely unimportant and declining. It is \u00bbemarkable as being the port from which William the Conqueror embarked with his army for the conquest of England. Buoys and beacons. \u2014 Three wooden beacons with brooms for top-marks, and three buoys, one red and two black, mark the entrance channel ; the two inner beacons are on either side of the channel near the shore, one at the western edge close to the foot of Cabourg point, the other about a cable from it on the eastern edge. The third beacon is also on the eastern side, 3 or 4 cables farther out. The beacons are seldom moved, but the buoys are shifted whenever the course of the channel undergoes any decided alteration. There are, in addition, two beacons surmounted by discs on the shore which act as leading marks by day, as the lights do by night. The lower leading beacon is coloured red, black, and white ; and is close to the tower of the high light. The high leading beacon is on the slope of Beuzeval hill and is black. The lower beacon is moveable, to suit the line of direction to the changes of the channel. LIGHTS. \u2014 Two fixed red lights, visible 9 and 8 miles, through an arc of 32\u00b0, are established on the eastern side of the mouth of the river Dives ; when in line, they mark the fairway into the channel. The lower light is shown only so long as there is a depth of 3\u00a3 feet or more. They bear about N. E. and S. \\ W. from each other, are 195 yards apart, and are respectively 148 and 10 feet above high water ; the lower light is shown from a moveable wooden structure by means of which its position may be changed in order to adapt the line of direction to changes in the channel ; the upper light from a stone watch-house. Directions.\u2014 Northerly winds are the best for entering the river Dives, but it is necessary to wait for high water, whatever the vessel's draught, except at springs, when, with a smooth sea, small vessels may enter an hour after high water, if there is wind enough to Sri chart, No. 1,821."], [491, "Chap.

With off-shore winds, the entrance should only be attempted by small vessels, and they should be prepared for the heavy gusts coming down from the high land through the valleys. The pilots have no good boats for boarding vessels outside the entrance in bad weather. A vessel, therefore, compelled to enter the river with a strong northerly wind, must contrive to be about 1^ miles from the shore on the meridian of the Balise de Dives at high water. From thence, bring the leading beacons in line, and steer in between the entrance beacons, leaving the two black buoys and outer beacon on the port hand and the red buoy on the starboard hand ; when near the entrance between the two inner beacons, a pilot will be met with to conduct her to a berth. Anchorage. \u2014 There is good anchorage off the entrance to the Dives 1\u00a3 or 2 miles from the shore, where, in fine weaxher, a vessel may remain until there is sufficient water in the channel. With a turning wind into the river, it is necessary to anchor in order to retain a favourable position ; for, the velocity of the flood stream is here considerably increased by the indraught of the river Seine, and a vessel remaining under sail would be drifted to leeward of the entrance. No vessel should, however, remain at anchor unless the weather continues fine and the wind is off-shore ; should it come from seaward, with no certainty of entering the river at high water, it is necessary to weigh without delay and seek refuge either at Havre or Honfleur. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the river Dives at 9h. 39m. ; springs rise 21 feet, neaps 16 feet ; but, in the shoalest part of the channel abreast of the eastern beacon, where the bottom is 8 feet above the level of the lowest tides, the water rises about 18^ feet at equinoctical springs, 16^ feet at ordinary springs, and 7\u00a3 feet at neaps.

An imaginary line drawn from Beuzeval point to cape de la Heve may be considered the boundary between the sea and river navigation, and approximately, the western limit of the accumulation of sand and mud, forming dangerous shoals in the estuary ; no vessel should approach this limit, unless bound to some port of the Seine, and it is in the neighbourhood of this limit that the indraught of the river begins to gain strength with the rising tide.* Depths, &C \u2014 From this outer limit of the estuary to the commencement of the artificial stone embankment of the river Seine, abreast of Berville, the distance is only 13 or 14 miles, and from thence, following the Binuosities of the river, it is about 58 miles to Rouen. At the entrance between the embankments, the width is about 760 yards. At Tancarville, 4^ miles higher, where the canal from Havre opens into the river, it is 515 yards wide, and its width continues to diminish until at Rouen it is only 165 yards wide. In the outer part of the channel between the sand-banks there are only 3 or 4 feet water at the lowest tides, and from 26 feet at high water, springs, to 21 or 22 feet at ordinary neaps. Within the embankments, at no part in the best water is there less than 10 feet at the lowest tides, whilst at many parts it is sufficiently deep to afford anchorage where large ships may remain afloat. At high water, the range of tide decreasing within the river, the least depth varies from 16 feet 10 inches at the slackest neaps, to 24 feet 8 inches at springs. Vessels of 23 feet draught have ascended to Rouen, and it is considered safe for those of 21 feet to do so, at springs. From Tancarville upwards, the whole of the land has been reclaimed up to the embankments. Below that place a considerable tract is overflowed at high water. It may be here mentioned that the great engineering improve ments effected during the last 40 years have no appearance of finality. In March, 1895, a law was passed under which financial arrangements were made for the following vast works : \u2014 As regards the navigation to Rouen, the proposed improvements include the repairs of present embankments and removal of shoals, the extension of the embankments as far as Honfleur, the works necessary to maintain at Honfleur an entrance to the Seine equal in depth to that river, works necessary to ensure the navigation of the * See Admiralty charts :\u2014 Entrance of the Seine, No. 2,680 ; scale, \u00bb\u00ab = 2 inches ; and, Plan of the Seine on chart of English channel, No. 2,675e ; scale, \u00bbt = 0-5 of an inch."], [493, "Chap.

As regards Havre, the proposed improvements comprise the deepening of the present S.W. channel to 15| feet at low water, the sea defences of cape de la Heve, the construction of an outer port with the necessary dredgings, and the construction of a deeper and more direct entrance to the Bassin de l'Eure and the Bassin Bellot. Banks. \u2014 The principal banks in the estuary and obstructing the mouth of the Seine are, the Trouville, the Ratier, the Amfard, the Hauts de la Rade, and the Eclat, the higher parts of some of which uncover at low water ; the two first are near the southern shore, the Amfard in the centre, and the two last near the northern shore between Havre and cape de la Heve. In 1855, it was found that the Hauts de la Rade and the Eclat had not undergone any perceptible change since 1834, but the banks southward and eastward of them are subject to considerable alteration. The Amfard and Ratier banks divide the mouth of the Seine into three channels, two of which, at low water, are blind channels abutting on the shifting sands, then uncovered, within the estuary. The southern channel is that which leads to and beyond Honfleur ; the northern channel leads to and above Havre on the northern shore ; and the central channel is the main channel, just now described, by which vessels ascend to and above Rouen. This channel is always open though with but little water in it, at low tide, between the end of the embankments and the sea. In these channels, the stream runs 7 or 8 knots at springs, and 4 or 5 knots at neaps, and vessels of deep draught should avoid approaching the outer banks during the flood, for if once they should be carried amongst and ground on these sands they would certainly be lost, for anchors will not hold in the shifting sand, and the violence of the stream, increasing in velocity as it advances eastward, is irresistible. Vessels are exposed to great danger and indeed are forbidden to attempt the main channel without the assistance of the pilots of Quilleb\u0153uf, who are specially appointed to conduct vessels above Havre and Honfleur. It is the duty of these pilots to watch the changes in the position of the banks, and to mark the actual direction of the channel by beacons, see page 471. Their principal stations are at Havre and Honfleur, where they are always in sufficient number to meet the requirements of navigation. At See oharte. Nos. 2,\u00ab80 and 2,675c."], [494, "466 [Chap.

THE SEINE. \u2014 ESTUARY AND RIVER. either of these places, sailing vessels bound up the Seine can also procure steam-tugs, which are generally used to ensure a speedy passage past the dangers of the lower Seine. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 To comprehend the unusual tidal con ditions of the river Seine, the nature of the offing streams in the vicinity must be taken into consideration. The general channel flood stream, sharply compressed between the head of the Cotentin peninsula and the English coast, again expands eastward cf the meridian of Barfleur, taking four principal directions ; one portion follows the English coast, another strikes the coast of France between Dieppe and cape Grisnez, a third runs in the direction of cape d'Antifer, and a fourth flows round the shores of the Baie de la Seine. It is the last two with which we are now concerned. Of that portion which strikes the coast in the neighbourhood of cape d'Antifer, one part takes a southerly direction, meets and unites with the coast stream from the westward off the entrance of the Seine, and thus causes the tide to rise very rapidly in the first part of the flood. This, in conjunction with the form of the estuary and of its sand and mud banks, is probably the primary cause of the phenomenon known as the Bore, Mascaret, or Barre, which will now be described, the information being mainly derived and abridged from the personal observations of M. A. Dormoy, chief pilot of the Lower Seine, published in 1892, with corrections and additions from the latest information available. THE BORE. \u2014 The flood makes in the Seine at the hours anticipated, but under very different aspects, dependent both on the state of the tides (neaps or springs), and also on the seasons. The replacement of the ebb by the flood is thus a complex phenomenon. The general result is, that in weak neap tides the ascending stream replaces the descending stream without any apparent effort, and so easily that an observer may remain in doubt as to the precise moment of the change ; in mean tides, the reversal of the stream, shown by a gentle undulation of the waters throughout the whole breadth of the river, seems to be immediate ; and, in spring tides, the flood rushes in suddenly accompanied by an agitation more or less turbulent, and at times so considerable as to be a real source of danger. The establishment of the flood under these extraordinarily violent conditions is named the Bore, or by the French Mascaret or Barra. It occurs almost invariably every spring tide, and is See charts, Nos. 2,680 and 2,675c."], [495, "Chap. X.] 467 TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 THE BORE. especially strong about the time of the equinoxes or with high spring tides from any cause ; it is highest with easterly winds and lowest with those from the westward, and as the wave frequently breaks in shoal water, small decked craft unable to avoid it should be battened down or will inevitably be swamped. Let us suppose that this phenomenon is about to occur : \u2014 An observer stationed at Rille light a few minutes before low water, springs, and looking towards the estuary, would see the bay laid dry as far as the eye could reach, except where the river, flowing in the direction of Honfleur, covered a breadth of some hundred yards between banks of muddy sand. The ebb stream still runs from 2 to 3 knots, but its speed slackens suddenly and at the same time a slight surf is seen at a distance against the outline of the banks ; its noise is heard and the water invades the uncovered places very rapidly. An irregular swell (for it subsides here and there) ascends the channel, inclining each buoy in succession and marking the course of the flood stream which has thus suddenly set in. It penetrates the embanked part of the river. Its triple or quadruple undulation becomes immediately more marked ; the level rises visibly ; the North dike is fringed with foam. A moment after, on its passage to La Roque and afterwards to Radicatel, waves break, especially near the right bank. Along the left bank there is scarcely any agitation. The boats of Tancarville and Quilleb\u0153uf may be seen resting on their oars, bows on to the approaching swell ; they rise to it, turn about when it has passed, and ascend with the stream ; in this manner boats in that part of the river take the flood ; without that precaution they would be capsized. From Quilleb\u0153uf, looking in the direction of Radicatel, the river is broken water right across,* the water breaking much more heavily against the right bank than the other, doubtless on account of the bend, as the waves rush upon it obliquely and cover the platform of the dike with their spray. The mass of water reaches Quilleb\u0153uf before the agitation of which we speak is at an end at Rille, and it lasts some minutes longer, calm not being restored until the Bore is near the bend of Vieux port. On the arrival of the Bore at Quilleb\u0153uf, its height, which increases, may be 7 or 8 feet ; that is to say, there is that difference * Hence the name of Bar re given by the riverside population to the Bore or Mascaret.

X- THE SEINE. \u2014 ESTUARY AND RIVER. of level between low water and that of the flood which rushes up-stream in this torrent ; so that a boat in front would see before it a liquid wall approaching and capable of engulfing it. The wave comes on in the form of a crescent, concave towards up-stream, and its two points breaking furiously along the banks. Another wave follows at about 200 yards, then a third, and a fourth. Then appear the Eteules, silent waves of a very dangerous character, up to (it is said) 16 feet in height, but subsiding heavily as soon as formed. This state of confusion passed, the river flows steadily on ; the level does not rise more than an additional 3 feet, although the rate of the stream increases to 7 knots and more. From the first appear ance of the Bore until calm is restored after its passage up the river, not more than a quarter of an hour elapses. The Bore is sometimes still higher and more furious at the foot of St. Leonard. It would be very imprudent for any small vessel to be caught in these parts. It subsides very remarkably at La Corvette, where ships, which on account of their draught have not been able to put to sea, await it at anchor ready for weighing and swung to the ebb, for there is no slack water, the ebb ceasing only with the flood, the chain ready to be slipped at a moment's notice. Each vessel at the proper moment sets the engines going astern. Notwithstanding this, the vessel runs ahead and commences swinging, the propeller being then used to avoid the banks. Steam vessels getting under way before the Bore so as to receive it head-on, should meet it at slow speed, plunging into the wave. Sailing-vessels in tow meet it in this manner with a great length of tow-line. Continuing its course up-stream, the Bore passes abreast of Des Flaques with the same violence as at St. Leonard, and calms down in the deep waters of the anchorage of La Courbe ; a little farther on, however, upon the Traverse, it breaks out afresh from one bank to the other. From Villequier it may be seen white with foam, the tide running furiously, leaping up the banks, dragging and submerging everything on its passage. The roar of the approaching Bore is heard from a great distance ; at Villequier, it has been distinctly heard at night on reaching Aizier, 6 miles distant. At Villequier, boats moor near the lighthouse under shelter of a rocky submarine point, behind which the water is relatively calm for a small space. But in heavy Bores they should descend as far as Sec charts, Nos. 2.6K0 and 2,675c."], [497, "Chap. X.] 469 THE BORE. Courbe. The boats of Caudebec shelter as well as they can at the Dos d'ane (Ass's back). The appearance of the Bore is particularly attractive at Caudebec as the waves coming on obliquely, as at Radicatel, on account of the very decided concavity of the bank, only display the greater vigour, and the water recoiling adds to the disorder. Tourists came here in crowds to view the scene, especially at equinoctial tides. At La Mailleraye, 3is miles higher, the Bore loses much of its force ow7ing to the bank Les Meules, which produces a situation differing entirely from the localities farther up-stream by the obstacle which it raises to the retreat of the waters. It may be said that La Piette is the ordinary up-stream limit of the Bore, as beyond that it usually becomes only an undulation of greater or less height, according to the bottom over which it passes. At Duclair, it is generally possible for a vessel to remain at the wharf ; and finally at Rouen, the arrival of the undulation only manifests itself, as a rule, by a movement, more or less pronounced, of the vessels moored along the quays. It had been hoped that the great improvements effected by the embankments and the deepening of the Seine would have either destroyed the Bore or reduced to a nullity its effects ; and, indeed, it was for some time currently reported that such had been the case. Unfortunately, time has shown that these hopes have not been verified, though the works have certainly effected some slight modi fications. The latest information up to 1896 shows that the Bore is almost, if not quite, as strong as ever in the lower reaches, and, as a consequence of the deepening, is certainly stronger than before in the upper part, ancl notably so at Rouen, where, quite recently, steamers have been known to break adrift from their lashings alongside the quays. Between the mouth of the Seine and Rouen, the following may be taken as approximately the height of the Bore or tidal wave at places from 15 to 20 miles apart : \u2014 At Quilleb\u0153uf \u2014 strong springs, 7 to 8 feet ; weak springs, 4 feet. Caudebec \u2014 strong springs, 7 to 8 feet ; weak springs, 4 feet. \u201e Duclair \u2014 strong springs, 2 to 4 feet ; weak springs, 1 foot. \u201e Rouen \u2014 strong springs, 2 feet ; weak springs, nil. These figures refer to the height of the wave alongside the quays or banks, for it has been observed that in mid-channel, where the resistance to its progress is less, the height of the wave also is less. See charts, Nos. 2,680 and 2,675c."], [498, "[Chap. X. 470 THE SEINE. \u2014 ESTUARY AND RIVER. Propagation Of the flood. \u2014 At present, and as a consequence of the embankments, the rising undulation at neap tides traverses the distance from Berville to Rouen, 58 miles, in 7 hours, represent ing an hourly speed of 8'3 miles, which is nearly uniform. In mean tides, its passage is made in 5 hours, at a speed of 11*6 miles, per ceptibly slackened over the shoals and accelerated in deep water. At spring tides, the propagation gains in rapidity and loses still more in uniformity ; its mean speed is 14-5 miles, the flood getting from Berville to Rouen in 4 hours. Before the embankments and dredgings took place the rising undulation travelled from Berville to Rouen in 5 hours, at spring tides. This is the only information of the kind available of that time, but apparently the tide took one hour longer then than now in its transit between the two places. As regards the danger of the Bore and of the strong tides generally of the Seine, M. Bailly, marine surveyor, remarks : \" If a vessel from any cause takes the ground, it frequently happens, especially during springs, that when the flood reaches her she is thrown on her broadside and buried in the sand set in motion by the strength of the stream, and becomes, in almost every case, a lost vessel.* The number of masts standing up in various parts of the river testify that these misfortunes are not unfrequent, and the greatest attention should therefore be paid by commanders of vessels ascending the river until they arrive at Quilleb\u0153uf, where they can be secured to the quay before their vessels are exposed to the danger of grounding in the channel. If they cannot arrive at this position before the end of the flood they should hasten to take shelter either at Honfleur or Havre, whilst there is yet sufficient water in the narrow channels. Generally speaking, they should not attempt to ascend or descend the river without a leading wind or in tow of a steam-vessel.\" \" Sailing vessels at Havre or Honfleur intending to ascend the Seine, should leave those ports directly they float, and, with a leading wind, they may expect to reach Quilleb\u0153uf before the ebb begins to be felt. This navigation, however, can only be undertaken with safety during springs, for, at neaps, the depth of water is not suffi cient for vessels of much draught to navigate the lower part of the * A recent case is that of the s.s. Aberdeenshvre, which vessel, having been com pelled through fog to drop her anchor between Berville and Tancarville. took the ground on a shifting sand bank, heeled over and sank, the crew escaping with their boats, except the chief engineer, who was drowned.

Most vessels waiting at Havre for springs to ascend the river, quit the harbour on the ebb preceding the flood which is to take them up to Quilleb\u0153uf, and anchor in the Petite. Rade ; by doing so, they avoid the loss of time which the getting out of harbour would occasion with westerly winds, and do not run the risk of losing a favourable tide.\" ROUEN. \u2014 Of the city of Rouen itself it need only be said that its position as practically the port of Paris has amply justified the efforts so far made to improve its waterway. (For Depths, see page 464.) In the three years 1869-1871 the amount of shipping entering and clearing averaged about 500,000 tons, whilst in the three years 1889-1891 the average was over 2,000,000 tons, the tonnage having thus quadrupled in a period of 20 years ; its commerce continues to advance in about the same ratio, the increase being no less remarkable in the size of the ships than in the aggregate tonnage. Vessels lie alongside its quays bordering the river, or in the Bassin Maritime, which has an area of 22| acres. There is also a building slip capable of taking vessels of 1,800 tons, and 312 feet in length. A British Consul is stationed at Rouen. LIGHTING OF THE SEINE.\u2014 At Berville, a mile west- ward of the embankments, on the southern shore, is a square turret, from which is exhibited a fixed white light, visible 17 miles. Rille light, fixed white, is at the end of the southern embankment ; here, also, a fog bell is sounded every If seconds, when necessary. At the end of the northern embankment is a red fixed light \u2014 both of these lights are visible 7 miles. From thence upwards, all lights on the right or northern bank of the Seine are red, and all those on the left bank are ivhite. In proceeding up-stream, therefore, all red lights are left on the port hand, and all white lights on the starboard hand. Pilotage regulations. \u2014 The following regulations for the pilotage of the lower Seine were issued by the Chef de la Marine at Havre, in February, 1887 : \u2014 \" 1. Every pilot of Quilleb\u0153uf who pilots a ship drawing 5 metres (16 feet 4i inches) or more up the river, and who has not examined that part for more than four days, is obliged before entering the mouth of the river to procure an assistant pilot, who undertakes the guidance of the ship as far as the entrance between the dikes. \" 2. In this case the pilot fees are to be distributed between the two pilots. See charts, Nos. 2,680 and 2,675c. SO 11886 2G"], [500, "[Chap. X. 472 THE SEINE. \u2014 ESTUARY AND RIVER. \" 3. The assistant pilots are taken on board of the ships referred to in Section 1 by the steamer Rouen, Captain Carre, stationed at Havre, which has to go every day, at the beginning of the flood tide, to meet ships bound for the Seine. \" 4. Besides taking the assistant pilots on board ships, the steamer is also bound to inform ships going up the Seine, by word of mouth, or, if this is not possible, by the following signals, of important facts connected with their course : \u2014 (a.) A blue flag, 5 feet square, with the letter R in white, means \" a clear channel.\" (b.) The same flag over a red pendant, signifies, \" decrease in the depth of water at the entrance to the mouth of the river.\" (c.) The same flag under a red pendant, signifies, \" considerable changes in the direction of the channel.\" \" 5. The taking on board of the pilots and assistant pilots by the steamer is to be by turns, according to rules to be laid down by the chief officer of the Seine pilots. \" 6. The chief officer of the Seine pilots has to take the necessary measures for ensuring that the channel is examined by the pilots, if possible, every day ; and, that pilots do not go to sea if they have not examined the channel the day before. \" Special measures will be taken to ensure the carrying out of these regulations.\" By night. \u2014 Vessels desiring to ascend the Seine at night must approach the entrance near the Fosse d'Amfard light-buoy, hoist a white light at the main, and burn torches, when pilots will board them ; it is dangerous to arrive at this position until near high water, and it is always prudent to be assured of the aid of a pilot. SHOALS in the ESTUARY of the SEINE.\u2014 We now return to a more particular description of the Estuary of the Seine, with the ports on either side and the dangerous shoals by which it is encumbered. Bane de Seine. \u2014 The deposits of sand and mud washed down by the river Seine extend far beyond the shoals at the river's mouth and form an extensive submarine flat and slope, agreeing somewhat in shape with the curve of the bank bordering the shore from Port en-Bessin to the meridian of the Dives. This flat, on which the See charts, Nos. 2.613 and 2,680."], [501, "Chap.

The Bane de Seine and the deep southward of it, called by pilots the Parfond, are useful guides in establishing the position of a vessel during fogs or thick weather, when the navigation can only be carried on by means of the lead. From the western extreme of the bank, in 9 fathoms, cape de la Heve lighthouses bear E. by S. \u00a3 S. 15 miles, and Ver lighthouse S.W. \u00a7 W. 13 miles. Bane de Trouville. -This bank of muddy sand, the south westernmost of the shifting banks at the mouth of the Seine, is about 3 miles long in an E. by N. h N. direction, fronting and east ward of the entrance to Trouville, and from 5 cables to 1J; miles wide, with general depths of from 3 to 7 feet water. It is, however, very difficult to define its extent westward, the bank gradually extending in that direction and the water deepening so very gradually that at Is miles farther there are only 9 or 10 feet water. In the direction of the Bane du Ratier it has also shoaled so much that the depth is everywhere less now (1896) than 5 feet at the lowest tides. A portion of its surface on the inner edge of the bank, about 7 cables long and one cable wide, either dries from one to 4 feet or is awash at low water, springs ; this part lies in a N.E. and S.W. direction, about 4 cables from the shore abreast of Hennequeville. The sea is exceedingly heavy on this bank, with the wind from W.S.W. round by West to N.N.E. Buoys. \u2014 A black and white conical buoy with top-mark is moored westward of the Bane do Trouville in about 8 feet water, 1 -J- miles N.W. I W. from Trouville pier-heads. A red buoy with top-mark is moored a mile northward of the bank, between it and the outer extreme of the Ratelets.* * The relative positions of the buoys marking the Trouville, Ratelets, and Ratier banks, will be better understood by referring to the Admiralty chart than by any written description.

Villerville Channel. \u2014 The Bane de Trouville is separated from the shore by the Villerville channel, a narrow passage formerly much deeper, but which has now a general depth of only 6 feet with a very small area of 8 or 9 feet. The streams follow the direction of the channel, such as it is, and, in calm weather, the flood, at springs, runs about 5\u00a3 hours and ends 15 or 20 minutes after high water at Havre ; its greatest rate is about 4 knots, near half flood ; the ebb is rather weaker. Bane du Ratier, abreast of Villerville and 1\u00a3 miles from the shore, with the Ratelets, a prolongation of the bank westward, forms one of the most dangerous shoals at the mouth of the Seine. The bank is of an irregular shape, and its surface, which dries from one to 12 feet above the lowest tides, is covered with a large quantity of stones and rolled shingle ; but, its base is a mass of compact brown clay and consequently not subject to change. That part of the surface which uncovers, including the Ratelets, is 3-j- miles long in a W. by N. and E. by S. direction and forms a shelter from the flood stream to the banks of shifting sand eastward of it. From the western extreme of the Ratelets, in 6 feet, cape de la Heve light houses bear N. by E. \\ E. 5\u00a3 miles. The eastern limit of the red light at Deauville, see page 478, passes about 6 cables westward of that part of the Ratelets bank which uncovers, in 7 or 8 feet water. The Bane du Ratier covers towards half flood, and the sea runs high over it with strong winds between West and North, but, with the latter wind, it shelters in some degree the channel southward of it. Buoys. \u2014 The southern side of the Ratelets and Ratier is marked by three buoys, viz. : \u2014 the S.W. Ratier buoy, a black and red buoy near the south-western edge of the Ratelets, a black and white buoy abreast of the outer elbow of the Ratier, and a black buoy near its south-eastern elbow. On its northern side are the N.W. Ratier buoy, a large red buoy with staff and globe ; and a smaller red buoy near the eastern end. The N.W. Ratier buoy lies with Fatouville lighthouse on with the pier-heads at Honfleur S.E. by E. | E. Vessels going up the Seine northward of the Ratier bank, steer for this buoy and leave it on the starboard hand, by which time the Fosse d'Amfard fairway light-buoy is well in sight. Other buoys marking the banks are small, very subject to change of position, and cannot be seen until a vessel is nearly on them. (See note on preceding page.) See chart, No. 2,680."], [503, "Chap. X.] VILLERVILLE CHANNEL. \u2014 BANC D'AMFARD. 475 Bane d' Amfard lies about 2 miles northward of the Ratier, and, like the latter, its base is a mass of brown clay and its surface is covered with large shingle ; it, also, shelters the bank of shifting sand eastward of it. The western part of this bank uncovers only at low water, equinoctial springs, but its surface is subject to great changes ; for, in 1855, it was found that the stones which constituted its inferior part in 1834, were then buried under shingle 6 feet thick, proving that the shingle on it is not so stationary as on the Ratier. Buoy. \u2014 A buoy, painted with black and white bands, surmounted by staff and double cone topmark, is moored at the western extreme of the Bane d'Amfard close to a drying patch, and about South If miles from the lighthouse on the eastern side of the entrance to Havre. The position of the buoy is, however, liable to be changed in consequence of alterations in the form and depth of water on and around the bank. Light-buoy. \u2014 The Fosse d'Amfard light-buoy is moored in the channel southward of the Bane d'Amfard, which channel forms the main entrance through the estuary to the embankments of the river Seine. It exhibits a. fixed red light, visible about 3^ miles, and has the name painted on it ; the body of the buoy is painted with red and black horizontal bands. The buoy will be moved in accordance with any changes which may take place in the channel. The description of the Eclat, Hauts de la Rade, and other shoals on the northern side of the estuary, chiefly concern the approaches to Havre, and will be included in their proper place in describing that port, which is near the entrance on the right or northern bank of the estuary of the Seine, see page 492. We now return to the left or southern bank. LEFT BANK of the ESTUARY of the SEINE.\u2014 From the entrance of the river Dives to the hill of Notre Dame de Grace, which commands the town and harbour of Honfleur, the left bank of the estuary of the Seine trends about 14 miles E. by N. \\ N., and the coast is bordered by high hills, terminating abruptly towards the sea in cliffs of brown clay and stone, and in large landslips, except in front of three valleys where the shore is low and sandy. The widest and most remarkable of these valleys is that through which the little river Touques finds its way into the sea. This valley is 2 miles wide at the sea shore, but narrows suddenly 400 yards See chart, No. 2,680."], [504, "[Chap. X. 476 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. inland ; it may be recognised from a great distance off-shore by the town of Trouville, which is built at the foot of a high steep hill on the eastern side of the entrance of the river ; its suburb, Deauville, being on the western side. Vessels of more than 9 feet draught should be cautious in approaching the coast when within 4^ or 5 miles westward of the Touques, as the flat, with only from 3 to 10 feet water, there extends Lj miles from the shore and increases in width in going eastward, so that off the entrance of the Touques no more than 12 feet water is to be found in any direction at a distance of 2^ miles. Eastward of the Touques, the coast is bordered by uneven rocks which dry at low water and terminate 3 miles E.N.E. from Trouville in Villerville point. This point extends half a mile in a N.W. by N. direction from Villerville village and the ledge off it is dangerous to vessels proceeding through the Villerville channel, but is marked by a red buoy in 6 feet at its edge, 7 cables from the shore. If the buoy should be gone, this rocky point will be avoided when passing northward of it, by keeping Roque point opening and shutting in with Fonds cliff E. \u00a7 S. Roque point is a high greyish white cliff, perpendicular towards the river side, and may be easily recognised, being the first point on the left bank of the Seine which is seen to open out from Fonds cliff when coming from the South-west. TROUVILLE- \u2014 Touques river. \u2014 The- entrance to this river lies E. by N. \\ N. 7^ miles from that of the Dives, and is between two piers extending seaward in a N. by W. direction. The West pier extends 625 yards from point Deauville on the western side of the river, and the sands dry at low water 4 cables beyond the pier-head. The East pier does not extend so far from point Cahotte on the eastern side, the pier-heads bearing from each other about E.S.E. and W.N.W. The sands of Deauville form the western side of the channel from the pier-head to the low water line, and it is marked by three red buoys ; but, from the East pier-head a low dike of rough stone, intended to prevent the eastern sands from drifting into the channel, extends a considerable distance, the channel curving to the westward ; this dike is marked close to on its western side by three black buoys. Depths. \u2014 The channel between the piers is 164 feet wide ; the deepest.water, about 19 or 20 feet, at high water, springs, and 4 feet less at neaps, being towards the West pier.

Within the piers the harbour opens out, and, on the eastern side are the quays of Cahotte and of Trouville old harbour extending up to the bridge, with good grounding berths alongside for vessels up to 12 or 14 feet draught. On the western side, its entrance facing the quays of Cahotte point, is the wet dock or basin, 986 feet, long 263 feet wide, with 20 feet over the sill at high water, springs, and 16 feet at neaps ; the dock gates are open from 1^ hours before to 1^ hours after high water. This basin is surrounded by extensive quays ; and, in it, vessels of 15 feet draught can lie afloat at all times and unload direct into railway trucks, the railway station being just at the head of the basin, and rails laid along the quays. There is no dry dock, nor can repairs of any importance be effected. A public and also a private hospital are both available for seamen in case of need. Coal, &C- \u2014 From 3,000 to 5,000 tons of coal are usually in stock at this port, and steamers are coaled in the basin. The chief import is coal, of which between 60,000 and 70,000 tons arrive annually ; the other imports are wood, cement, ice, &c. The exports are unimportant. In 1895, the trade of the port, exclusive of its large fishing industry, was represented by the entry of 140 vessels, of which 119 were steamers of an aggregate of 45,187 tons ; of this number 113 vessels of 38,000 tons were British. Vice-Consul. \u2014 A British Vice-consul is stationed at Trouville. Trouville, formerly a small fishing port and village, has since 1860 expanded into a place of considerable commercial importance, though its trade appears to be now on the decrease, as well as having become a fashionable watering place. Including its suburb Deauville, across the river, it has a population of about 9,000. The railway station is at Deauville, and the communication is through Lisieux with the Cherbourg and Paris line, as well as eastward and westward with Honfleur and Dives. Steamers run daily between it and Havre, for both passengers and goods, the passage lasting about 45 minutes. The small town of Touques is on the river about 2 miles above Trouville, and, at springs, vessels of light draught can ascend as high as Quai-au-Coq, a small place 5^ miles in the interior, where there is sufficient water for them to remain afloat.

Directions. \u2014 Nearly all the trade is now done by steamers. For sailing vessels, westerly winds are the most favourable for entering the harbour. They should not enter until half an hour before high water, but, with a leading wind, may continue to enter until an hour after high water, if of suitable draught, as the ebb is easily stemmed. With off-shore winds, small vessels may anchor in about 10 feet water and 1\\ miles from the beach abreast of the plain of Villers, which is 3 miles south-westward of the river entrance ; here they may remain until the tide has risen sufficiently for them to enter ; but, with the wind from N.W. they should, if in charge of a pilot, anchor in the Villerville channel between the Trouville bank and the shore, where there is a small space with 2 fathoms water ; if the wind should then freshen and back to West or S.W., they will be able to run through the channel and take refuge at Honfleur. The Coast. \u2014 From the mouth of the Touques, the steep coast trends 3 miles E.N.E. as far as the small village of Villerville, which stands rather high ; it then bends more eastward for 4 miles to the hill of Notre Dame de Grace, one of the highest and the most conspicuous hill in the estuary of the Seine, which is 3^- miles wide between this point and Hoc point on the northern shore. The only part between Trouville and Honfleur where the shore is low and accessible at high water is eastward of Villerville, between it and Vasoui. HONFLEUR. \u2014 This port is at the entrance of a beautiful valley, open to the North-east, and just eastward of the hill of Notre Dame de Grace. It is sheltered by the land on all sides, and the wind never raises such a sea as to make it dangerous to enter. Being so near Havre, it neither has nor needs much plant for repairing vessels, and its large building yards are now but little used. The See chart, No. 2,680."], [508, "[Chap. X. 480 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. trade of the port steadily decreases, no doubt owing to the improve ment in the Seine navigation and consequent enormous growth in the trade of Rouen. In 1895, 616 vessels, of a total tonnage of 134,789 tons, entered. The exports are chiefly dairy and agricultural produce ; the imports, timber and coals. The steamers of the London and South Western, and of the London, Brighton, and South Coast railways run regularly between it and Southampton and Newhaven respectively. The railway station is on the eastern side of the harbour, and the line connects with the general system of the country at Lisieux. Honfleur has both a sailors' home and a hospital ; its population is about 8,000. Coal. \u2014 An ample supply of coal can always be obtained, there being usually about 2,000 tons in stock. Steamers are coaled lying afloat at their ordinary berths alongside the quays in the basins. Vice-Consul. \u2014 A British Vice-Consul is stationed at Honfleur. The oort consists of an outer tidal harbour, and of four wet docks or Bassins-a-flot, viz. : \u2014 the Bassin de l'Ouest, Bassin du Centre, Bassins de l'Est, and Bassin Quatrieme. Provision is made by means of sluices, a large Bassin de Chasses, and other reservoirs of water for scouring them, as well as the channel leading into the port ; there is also a small tidal harbour on the western side, which serves chiefly for steamboats and small craft employed in the daily transport of passengers and country produce to Havre. The Bassin de l'Ouest is 427 feet long by 256 feet wide, and its depth is 18 feet at high water, extraordinary springs, 17 feet at ordinary springs, and nearly 10 feet at neaps. The Bassin du Centre is 427 feet long by 296 feet wide, and its depth is 21-J feet at extraordinary springs, 20\u00a3 feet at ordinary springs, and 13 feet at neaps. The Bassin de l'Est is 986 feet long by 236 feet wide, and its depth is 22| feet at extraordinary springs, 21f feet at ordinary springs, and 14^ feet at neaps. The Bassin Quatrieme is 1,181 feet long by 243 feet wide, and is 16 inches deeper than the Bassin de l'Est. Quay frontage and storage are very ample, and all modern appliances, steam cranes, &c, are available for the rapid loading or unloading of ships. The entrance of the port is between two piers, partly stone and partly timber, 230 feet apart, and it is open to N. by E. The West See chart, No. 2,680."], [509, "Chap. X.] HONFLBUR. \u2014 DHPTHS. \u2014 TIDES. 481 pier extends 370 yards from the shore ; and, from its head, the northern end of the breakwater of the Bassin de Chasses, which forms the eastern side of the entrance, bears E. \\ N. about 300 feet. The East pier is prolonged by a rough stone submersible dike, 650 yards long, constructed in 1886, to direct the channel and periodical flushings in order to overcome the rapid silting up to which this port appears to become more and more liable ; the dike is marked by branches of trees at frequent intervals. The shifting sands uncover 2 or 3 cables beyond the pier-heads. The direction of the channel being very subject to change, is marked by buoys, in accordance with the French uniform system, their positions being shifted as occasion may require. Vessels at high water, springs, usually pass over the small banks which form at the entrance of the channel, but it is dangerous for vessels under any circumstances to enter without a pilot, the sand being so moveable, and the streams, which set obliquely across the channel, so rapid, that a laden vessel grounding during a high tide would run great risk of being totally lost. Depths. \u2014 The depths in the old channel were 23 feet at high water, equinoctial springs ; 21 feet at ordinary springs ; and 11\\ feet at neaps. Of the new channel, it can only be said that in conse quence of the shifting nature of the sands the depths are very un certain, but are 5 feet less at neaps than at springs. Westerly winds of any duration serve to raise the ! water, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. During rainy weather and at the melting of the snow, the freshets of the Seine are abundant, and with strong westerly winds they contribute greatly to raise the water in the port. Tides and tide Signals.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Honfleur, at 9h. 29m. ; springs rise 23 feet ; neaps 18 feet. High water slack lasts only 15 or 20 minutes, but the change in height from half an hour before to half an hour after high water not being more than 3 or 4 inches, the basins remain open for that time without inconvenience. The usual tide signals, see page 12, are made from a mast on the East jetty near the lighthouse. In addition are the following local signals :\u2014 1. A blue flag hoisted at the signal flagstaff, signifies that all movement within the port is forbidden. See chart, No. 2,680."], [510, "[Chap. X. 482 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE, 2.

Breakwater. \u2014 At the north-western extreme of the breakwater of the Bassin de Chasses, E. \\ N. about 300 feet from the West pier head, is shown, from a wooden structure, a fixed green light, visible 4 miles. East pier.--Tide light. \u2014 From a round brick tower on the eastern pier at the entrance to the tidal harbour, is shown a fixed white light, varied by red and green flashes ; it is 39 feet above high water and visible 9 miles. This light is shown only when there are 6\u00a3 feet or more in the channel ; each red flash indicates 3 \\ additional feet, and each green flash 10 inches more. Thus, with the white light showing, two red flashes followed by one green flash signifies that the depth in the channel is 13| feet. With the white light showing, one red flash followed by three green flashes signifies a depth of 12 feet. Interior jetties. \u2014 Two small fixed white lights are also shown from the interior sides of the jetty-heads of the port. Fog Signal. \u2014 During thick or foggy weather, a bell is sounded by machinery eight times every minute during the whole time that the tide light is or would be shown. The signal is made from the West pier-head. See chart, No. 2,680."], [511, "Chap. X.] 483 HONFLEUR. \u2014 LIGHTS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. Fatouville lighthouse is an octagonal tower 105 feet high, on the high lands of Fatouville 3| miles S.E. by E. \\ E. from Honfleur West pier-head ; it exhibits at 715 feet above high water a fixed white light varied every three minutes by a red flash ; the flash is preceded and followed by a short eclipse, which, however, is not total within a distance of 12 miles. The light is visible 21 miles. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Honfleur is accessible to vessels of moderately deep draught during springs ; its trade is becoming year by year more engrossed by steamers, but as a few large sailing vessels still use the port, the following directions, mainly applicable to them, appear to be necessary. Vessels arriving at the mouth of the Seine, at neaps, must wait for water to enter the passages leading to Honfleur either under sail, with the wind from W.S.W. round by West to N.N.E., or at anchor in the Grande Rade off Havre if the wind be off the land ; if remaining only a day or two for sufficient water, they may anchor in Carosse roads, southward of the prohibited anchorage, in from 5 to 7 fathoms, mud and sand, with cape de la Heve lighthouses in line N.E. f N. ; and, Fatouville lighthouse open half a point northward of Hospital jetty lighthouse at Honfleur. At this anchorage, the stream runs towards the Seine until 4 hours flood ; its greatest strength is at 3 hours before high water at Havre and does not exceed 4 knots. Vessels having only a few hours to wait for tide, should keep under sail westward of cape de la Heve lighthouses in line, and a little northward of the line of the Hospital jetty lighthouse at Honfleur on with Fatouville lighthouse bearing S.E. by E. \\ E. ; but, should the strength of the tide drift them towards the river, they muss anchor before passing these limits. Passes de Honfleur. \u2014 Two narrow passages lead to Honfleur. The North passage is between the Amfard and Ratier banks and across the shifting sands fronting Honfleur. Pilots take sailing vessels through this channel with the wind between W.N.W. and N.N.E. ; but, with contrary winds, although there is room to work, large vessels are usually towed. Hospital jetty lighthouse on with Fatouville lighthouse S.E. by E. h E. leads just northward of the N.W. Ratier buoy, and Honfleur East pier light, open to the right of the Hospital jetty light leads southward of the Bane d'Amfard and up to the Fosse d'Amfard fairway light-buoy, as ter passing which the channel See chart, No. 2,680."], [512, "[Chap. X. 484 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. up to the piers is indicated by buoys, constantly watched and their positions changed as may be necessary \u2014 red buoys to be left on the starboard hand, black buoys on the port hand as usual. No vessel should attempt to enter without a pilot. The South passage is between the Ratier and Trouville banks ; its leading line is, the northern extreme of Fonds cliff, Honfleur, on with Roque point, remarkable for its grey tint and its perpendicularly steep shore. In running through, this mark must be kept on until abreast of Vasoui.; from thence to Honfleur, keep between 2 and 3 cables from the shore. At night, keep Roque light just open of Fonds cliff, but bear in mind that fixed directions cannot be given in consequence of the shifting nature of the sands. This passage is the deepest and is generally taken by sailing vessels with the wind between S.S.E. and W.N.W. ; coasters may run through it at 2\\ hours, and larger vessels at 3i hours flood ; but, with a leading wind, during springs, it should not be entered by large vessels until 4 hours flood, as, between Villerville and Honfleur, that stream runs with great rapidity in the direction of the passage. The flood stream, at springs, commences 5 hours before high water at Havre and runs b\\ hours ; its greatest velocity is towards half flood and is sometimes 7 knots between Vasoui and Honfleur. Should a vessel arrive abreast of Vasoui much before high water, she should sheer a little in-shore where the tide has less strength, and anchor until nearly high water. With strong southerly winds, vessels should be on their guard against the heavy gusts which rush down the narrow valleys between Penne de Pic and Honfleur ; vessels have sometimes been dismasted by them. Small vessels, when bound to Honfleur from the South-west, may use the Villerville channel ; but, in doing so, they must proceed with caution by the lead and haul off in time to give a good berth to the rocky ledge off Villerville ; having passed the red buoy at its outer extreme, they may proceed by the leading mark for the South channel. Entering Honfleur. \u2014 The most favourable winds for a sailing vessel to enter this port are those between W.S.W. and E.N.E. round by North. The channel is crossed obliquely by the flood and ebb streams, and their extreme velocity, at springs, is from 5 to 6 knots. The flood stream runs 5^ hours and ends just at high water \\ it is during the 15 or 20 minutes of slack water which then ensues See chart, No. -2,680."], [513, "Chap. X.] HONFLEUR.\u2014 DIRECTIONS.\u2014 CAPE DE LA HEVE. 485 that a pilot prefers to take in a vessel of deep draught, there being then but little difficulty in following the course of the channel. Plenty of sail should be carried in passing through the outer part of the channel, and an anchor should be always ready to let go in case a sudden shift of wind or the heave of the sea should force the vessel out of the channel. In the event of such an accident, a signal for a steam-tug should immediately be made, by hailing the colours under the bowsprit. If the entrance is missed, anchor at once and await the arrival of the tug ; or, failing her, with the commencement of the ebb, quit the river as speedily as possible. With a fresh southerly wind, it is necessary to guard against the sudden off-shore gusts before referred to ; they are frequently felt under the hill of Notre Dame de Grace and blow strongly down the valley at Honfleur. With a head wind or a calm, a steam-tug should always be obtained and when nearing the entrance channel the tow rope should be well shortened in, and great attention paid to follow exactly the wake of the tow-boat, for the smallest deviation in the steerage is here sufficient to run the vessel ashore. RIGHT BANK of the ESTUARY of the SEINE.\u2014 The extensive chalky level forming the plain of Caux, of which the mean height is about 375 feet above high water, bounds the northern shore of the estuary of the Seine ; and, from cape de la Heve, its most western point, as far as the meridian of Quilleb\u0153uf, the northern or right bank of the river presents, for a large portion of its extent, a face of perpendicular chalk cliffs intersected by deep valleys. About one mile eastward of cape de la Heve, however, commences a broad alluvial flat which, for a distance of 4 miles, fronts the high chalk formation. The town and port of Havre occupies the western portion of this flat, and the little town of Harfleur is at its eastern end, at the entrance to one of the deepest valleys. CAPE DE LA HEVE, formerly called Chef de Caux, is 2\\ miles N.N.W. of the entrance to Havre, and forms the western point of the chalky cliffs which terminate the plain of Caux. The cape is perpendicular about half way down from its summit, the foot of the cliff being covered with the debris of frequent slips and fallen masses ; works are now in progress to prevent further destruction, or the lighthouses would very soon be in danger. See chart, No. 2,680."], [514, "486 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. [Chap. X. LIGHTS. \u2014 On the summit of cape de la Heve stand two square white lighthouses, each Q6 feet high, and their lights 397 feet above high water. They bear N.E. \u00a7 N. and S.W. \u00a7 S. distant 107 yards from each other, and are obscured by Bleville hills when bearing S.W. | S. southerly. The southern lighthouse stands 100 yards from the edge of the cliff. The Northern lighthouse exhibits an electric flashing white light with a period of five seconds between each flash, visible 27 miles. Total eclipses intervene, but a continuous light caused by the brilliant illumination of the lantern is visible as much as 15 miles under certain oircumstances. The Southern lighthouse exhibits a fixed white light of the fifth order, visible 10 miles. The lead should be frequently used when approaching these lights from the westward, especially if the Ver light has not been sighted. Telegraph cable. \u2014 The telegraph cable communicating with America, via Ballinskellig bay, Ireland, leaves the shore about half a mile north-eastward of cape de la Heve. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on cape de la Heve ; it stands midway between the two lighthouses but westward of their line ; see page 12. Tide Signals. \u2014 A signal station is established about 2 cables S.S.E. from cape de la Heve lighthouses, from which is repeated, for the benefit of vessels in the offing or roads, the signals made at the tide signal station at the inner end of the North jetty at Havre. LE HAVRE. \u2014 The town, tidal harbour, and large Bassins-a-flot or wet docks of this important port occupy the western part of the low plain, before described. In 1895, the foreign trade entering the port was represented by 2,508 vessels measuring 2,263,000 tons, and the coasting trade by 4,154 vessels measuring 1.012,000 tons. Steamers of the largest size run to all parts of the world, and by means of the railway to Rouen and Paris, as well as by its extensive and constant steam river traffic, Le Havre has excellent means of communication with the interior of France. Large extensions and See chart, No., 2,680."], [515, "Chap.

The principal imports are cotton, coals, coffee, hides, timber, dye woods, petroleum, tobacco, oil seeds, palm oil, wheat, wood, &c, &c. The principal exports are silks and ribbons, broadcloths, dyes and essences, cotton goods, furniture, millinery, wines, brandy, &c, &c. The population of the town at the last census was 116,369. There is a hospital available for seamen in case of accident or illness, a Sailors' Home, and also reading rooms for seamen. Coals are to be obtained in any quantity, the stock on hand being usually from 10,000 to 12,000 tons. Vessels are coaled alongside the quays in the docks either from carts or barges or both. Many of the wet docks have water for the largest sized merchant vessels at all times. Every kind of supply is plentiful and good. Consular service. \u2014 A British Consul-General, and also a Vice- Consul are stationed at Le Havre. The Tidal harbour lies S.S.E. 2\u00a3 miles from cape de la Heve and is open to the heavy sea which rolls in with strong westerly winds. The entrance is between two jetties, of which the longest is on the northern side and partially shelters it from westerly winds ; the South jetty is short, and joins the dock walls on the eastern side. The bank outside the South jetty is a continuation of that in Heure bay, and, like it, is of shingle cemented together by mud, very hard and bad for anchors. The bottom of the entrance channel is of the same description ; but inside, the shingle is covered with a layer of mud which forms a good bed for vessels to ground on. The harbour is bordered by wide and commodious quays on all sides. The North quay is used by passenger steamers for the Seine and neighbouring ports. Steam-tugs lie alongside the Floride quay ; the rest of the harbour is used by coasters and by vessels waiting tide to go ap the Seine. Depths. \u2014 The harbour is accessible at high water to vessels drawing from 22 to 24 feet during five or six days at springs ; that is to say, a day or two before full and change, and three or four days after. At neaps, to those of about 4 feet less draught. It does not dry out at low water, springs, there being always at least 3 feet in the channel within the piers and 7 feet outside them. Any vessel that can enter the port can also enter the principal basins. Dredging operations are constantly in progress both in the harbour and basins See chart, No. 2,680. SO 11886 2H"], [516, "[Chap. X. 488 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. and periodical flushings tend to preserve and deepen the entrance channel. Basins.\u2014 There are at Havre nine basins or wet clocks with ample quay accommodation and storage, which communicate with the tidal harbour and with each other by gates. The basins' are named the Bassins du Roi, de la Barre, Vauban, de la Floride, de l'Eure, Bellot, du Commerce, de la Citadelle, and Bassin-dock. The Bassin de l'Eure is the largest ; the depth of water on the sill at its entrance is 33 feet 9 inches at high water springs, and 29 feet 5 inches at neaps ; that on the sill of the Bassin Bellot is only about 9 inches less ; in both cases, this is a considerably greater depth than the present approaches to the port require. The width of the entrance to the Bassin de l'Eure, which is the basin used by the large trans-atlantic steamers, is 100 feet. The entrance to the Tancarville canal is on the eastern side of the Bassin de l'Eure. The entrances to the other basins are from 6S feet to 37^ feet wide, the latter being the width of the entrance to the Vauban basin, where British colliers lie. The sills of the gates of the Bassins du Roi and de la Barre have 21Jj feet over them at high water, ordinary springs ; the western end of the Bassin de la Floride opens into the tidal harbour, and forms a convenient shelter for coasters and wind-bound vessels ; at its eastern end is a half -tide dock. The gates of the Bassins du Roi and de la Barre can remain open without inconvenience until the water has fallen 2 feet below high water, which, both at spring and neap tides, takes place about 1^ hours after high water slack ; and, as these gates are opened by the pressure of the rising tide about as long before the commencement of slack water, it follows that the basins can communicate with the harbour during 3^ or 4 hours of each tide. Dry docks. \u2014Havre has six dry clocks of the following dimensions : \u2014 See chart. No. 2,6S0. Length. Docks. Breadth of Entrance. Depth over sill at H.W. ord. spgs. On blocks.

Life-boats. \u2014 Three life-boats are stationed at Havre or in its immediate vicinity. Pilots. \u2014 The pilots of Havre are numerous and skilful, and are paid according to the distance piloted. According to regulations, the greatest distance is to cape Barfleur, and the least is, outside the banks at the entrance of the harbour ; there is great competition among them, however, and being provided with excellent boats, they frequently meet vessels as far westward as the Casquets. Those who pilot vessels out of harbour are bound to conduct them clear of the outlying banks ; if they consent to take them farther, they are paid 15 francs, or by special agreement. Steam-tugs are always in readiness, and the signal for their services being required is, an ensign suspended under the bowsprit. LIGHTS. \u2014 North jetty. \u2014 From a small round tower, 36 feet from the outer end of the northern jetty and 39 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed white light, visible 9 miles. South jetty. \u2014 A red flashing light, visible 12 miles, is shown at 27 feet above high water from the end of the southern pier ; the flash is of one second duration, the eclipses of four seconds. Grand Quai. \u2014 On the Grand quai within the harbour, a fixed green light, visible 8 miles, is shown from an iron support at 56 feet above high water. This light on with that on the South jetty, N.E. by E. E., leads between the Haut du Sud-Ouest and the Haut de Quarante and up io the harbour entrance. Fog Signal. \u2014 In thick or foggy weather, a fog trumpet is sounded near the lighthouse on the North jetty in the day time, from 2 hours before to 3 hours after high water ; at night, from one hour before to 2 hours after high water. It gives a blast of 8 seconds duration, followed by an interval of from 18 to 20 seconds. In addition, in very thick fogs, a smaller trumpet is sounded continuously. Should the trumpet be out of order a bell is sounded ; see fog signals, page 11. Tides and tide Signals.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Havre at 9h. 18m.

X. 490 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. the zero or level of soundings on the chart, which level is about 3-} feet below that of low water, ordinary springs. Neaps range 12^ feet. The ordinary tide signals, see page 12, are made from the signal-station at the inner end of the northern jetty, and repeated from a signal-station about 2 cables S.S.E. from cape de la Heve lighthouses. Strong and lasting westerly winds have sometimes raised the water to the level of the quay, but this rarely happens. The wind, how ever, has great influence on the height of the tide. The freshets of the Seine, during a rainy season or the melting of the snow, also contribute greatly to raise the water in the harbour, and it has been remarked that the highest tides have almost always occurred during the strongest freshets. Havre has the great advantage over most of the harbours on the French side of the channel, of a long period of slack at high water. The maximum duration of this high water slack has been observed to be lh. 15m., the minimum from 20 to 25 minutes, and the mean interval 57 minutes. This long period of slack water, together with the very slight rise and fall for a considerable time before and after, is very valuable to the traffic of the port, as it allows the basins to be open for 3 or 4 hours, and, therefore, many vessels are able to enter or leave the docks on the same tide. During the months of May, June and July, the duration of slack water is, with some exceptions, generally less than the mean ; the rest of the year it continues almost always an hour or more. At springs, the duration of the flood is 5h. 10m., and of the ebb 7h. 15m. To prevent accidents to vessels entering the harbour, the following additional signals are made at a flagstaff on the North jetty : \u2014 A white tias< with blue bor- | rnu , \u2014 der at the mast-head. | The basins are 0*)en ~i \u2014 ~-i -- -, A ball above the yard ) ,-, ., \u2014 pointing towards the road.

DANGERS Off\" HAVRE.\u2014 The approaches to Havre are obstructed by banks of stones and shingle which form a belt of dangers fronting the shore from 2 miles eastward of the entrance to cape de la Heve. The highest parts of this belt are, the Bane de l'Eclat, Hauts de la Rade, and Haut de la Petite Rade. By the survey of 1 855, there appeared to have been no perceptible alteration in these banks since 1834 ; the summit of the Eclat is, however, a little higher since then. Bane de l'Eclat is divided into two high ridges 2\\ cables apart; 10 feet is the least water on the northern ridge, but the highest part of the southern ridge is awash at low water and is one of the most dangerous spots in the neighbourhood of Havre. The surface of this shoal patch is covered with masses of flint and shingle ; from it, cape de la Heve southern lighthouse bears N.E. \\ E. 1| miles ; and, the North jetty lighthouse S.E. | E. 2\\ miles. In the depression between the two ridges of the Eclat bank, there is a patch with only 7 feet, and in other parts only 12 or 13 feet water; There is a passage into the Petite Rade at the south-western end of the bank with from 9 to 15 feet water, but it is too dangerous to be taken without a pilot. The Hauts de la Rade commence about 2 cables S. by E. from the shoalest spot on the Eclat, and, with the Grand Placard, the Haut du Sud-Ouest, and the Haut de Quarante, extend 2 miles beyond the entrance to Havre. The Hauts de la Rade consist of three ridges separated from each other by narrow channels with from 10 to 12 feet water and, in-shore of and sheltered by these ridges, is the Petite Rade. The North-west ridge is about 6 cables long and a cable wide ; it has 6 feet water on its highest part, which bears S. by E. \\ E. 5^ cables from the highest part of the Eclat. The south-western ridge lies 6 or 7 cables south-westward of this dangerous spot ; it has only 6 feet on it, and 9 feet at its western edge with cape de la Heve lighthouses in line ; it is the outer danger on the parallel of the entrance to Havre. Nearly midway between its edge and the Eclat, is a third rather extensive rocky flat with from 9 to 12 feet water. The Grand Placard is nearly half way between the western edge of the south-western ridge and the harbour entrance, and about 3 cables E.S.E. from it is the Haut du Sud-Ouest ; the latter has as little as 3 feet on it ; the former, only one foot at its eastern side.

The Haut de Quarante is the eastern part of these dangers, and is on the eastern side of the entrance to Havre ; it has as little as 3 feet on its outer part, only 3 cables from a similar depth on the Haut du Sud-Ouest. The two banks are connected by a 6-feet ridge, which forms the outer bar to the entrance. BUOYS. \u2014 The following buoys mark the shoals just described and the approaches to them ; and, consequently, indicate the positions of these dangers to all vessels bound to Havre and to those from the northward bound up the Seine. Some of the buoys are numbered and some are not ; the numbers, however, have but little or no reference to their positions, and they are consequently now described in the order in which they would be seen by a vessel approaching from the northward or north-westward. A stranger should under no circumstances pass within the outer line of buoys marking these shoals without a pilot : \u2014 An automatic whistle-buoy, painted black and red in horizontal stripes, lies in 7 fathoms, W. \\ N. 3g miles from cape de la Heve southern lighthouse. The whistle should be heard under favourable conditions of wind and sea from a distance of several miles. A bell-buoy, striped horizontally red and white with oval top-mark and reflector, is moored just westward of the northern shoal spot of the Bane de l'Eclat, with the Semaphore on cape de la Heve bearing E. by S. \\ S. 61 cables. No. 1 buoy, 4^ cables S.W. \\ W. from the last buoy described, is a cylindrical black buoy with square top-mark ; from it, the Semaphore bears E. \u00a7 N. 1-1 miles.

No. 5 buoy, 5 cables S. by W. from that last described, is a light buoy painted black and showing a red light ; it lies with cape de la Heve lights in line, and marks the northern side of the prohibited anchorage. See page 496. At 5 cables South from No. 5, is a light-buoy called Nord du Mouillage ; it is painted red, and marks the southern side of the prohibited anchorage. No. 7 buoy, one mile E. \u00a3 S. from No. 5 buoy, is black, and marks the southern edge of the Grand Placard shoal ; from it, Havre North jetty light bears E. f N. 1/3 miles. No. 4 buoy, 4 cables N.E. by N. from No. 7, is a small red buoy ; it marks the north-eastern side of the Grand Placard. No. 6, or Haut de Quarante buoy, is a white occulting light-buoy ; it is painted red and lies E. by S. \\ S. 1-6 miles from No. 5. From it, Havre South jetty light bears N.E. by E. \\ E. one mile. No. 11 buoy, black with double cone top-mark, lies at the northern side of the Haut de la Petite Rade ; from it, the North jetty light house bears S.E. by E. 5^ cables. PETITE RADE DE HAVRE is the anchorage inside the banks just described between Havre and cape de la Heve. It is well sheltered with the wind from N.E. round by East to S.E., but is open to all others, and strong breezes between North and W.S.W. send in a heavy sea. The holding-ground is good, and anchors take such firm hold in the clay that there is sometimes great difficulty in weighing, especially when vessels have been riding to strong westerly winds. It should, however, only be used as a temporary anchorage where vessels may wait, with off-shore winds, for sufficient water to enter the harbour, but they should not remain there in unsettled weather, nor if it blows strongly from the westward. Vessels of moderate draught anchor in the middle of the Petite Rade in 'from 16 to 27 feet water ; the best of the anchorage is 5 or 6 cables long in a N.W. and S.E. direction and 2 cables wide ; from its centre, in 20 feet, cape de la Heve lighthouses are in line ; and, Fatouville lighthouse, on the southern shore of the Seine, is on with the signal staff on the South jetty, See chart, No. 2,680."], [523, "Chap. X.] HAVRE. \u2014 PETITE AND GRANDE RADE. 495 Small vessels anchor nearer the shore, with Fatouville lighthouse open northward of the North jetty lighthouse ; but, no nearer than to have cape de la Heve southern lighthouse bearing North. The holding-ground here is so good that, unless she parted, a small vessel with a good scope of cable would be in no danger during a westerly gale. Directions. \u2014 The only practicable entrance to the Petite Rade de Havre for vessels of moderate draught at low water, is between the cliffs of cape de la Heve and the northern ridge of the Eclat, but a stranger should not use it without a pilot. The least depth midway between the northern ridge and the shore is 18 feet. To enter this channel, steer for the southern lighthouse on the cape on a S.E. \\ E. bearing ; this leads 3 cables north-eastward of the bell-buoy just outside the Eclat bank, and when about 3 cables from the cliffs, the vessel is in mid-channel and must then bear away southward for No. 2 red buoy, moored between the northern ridge of the Eclat and the shore, keeping it on the starboard bow and taking care not to approach so near the land as to entirely lose sight of the lantern of the northern lighthouse. Small vessels, locally acquainted, run for the anchorage in the Petite Rade at low water, passing either northward or southward of the southern ridge of the Eclat ; both channels have 13 feet water, but the lead and chart are the best guides for strangers. GRANDE RADE de HAVRE is simply an anchorage in the open sea, N.W. by W. 5 miles from cape de la Heve. Vessels of deep draught having to wait for springs to enter Havre, sometimes anchor here in quite fine weather or with off-shore winds, but they should be prepared to weigh instantly on any change in the weather. The holding-ground is excellent, and, from a vessel in the centre of the anchorage in 9 fathoms water, cape de la Heve bears S.E. by E. ; Fatouville lighthouse on with the North jetty lighthouse at Havre S.E. \\ E. ; and the outer whistle-buoy S. f E. about 2^ miles. When bound into Havre from the Grande Rade, with the wind from E.N.E. round by East to S.W., weigh as soon as the flood has acquired strength, so as to be near the Hauts de la Rade before the stream changes its direction north-eastward. When near these banks, the directions for entering the harbour presently given must be attended to. With a fair wind, weigh so as to be at the harbour's mouth at the proper time for entering. See chart, No. 2,680."], [524, "[Chap. X. 496 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. Prohibited anchorage. \u2014 Except in case of absolute necessity, vessels are prohibited from anchoring within the following areas : \u2014 1. In the area enclosed by a line running W. by N. \\ N., one mile from No. 5 buoy (black, with red light), and a line on a similar bearing and distance from No. 10 buoy (red with ivhite light). 2. In the area bounded on the West by a line drawn from No. 5 to No. 10 buoy ; on the North by a line joining No. 5 buoy and the North jetty lighthouse ; and on the South by a line joining No. 10 and No. 6 buoys, the latter with a white occulting light. The last section does not apply to sailing vessels not in tow, nor to fishing vessels or boats. TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 Petite Rade.\u2014 The flood stream begins in the Petite Rade about 1^ hours after the tide has begun to rise in the harbour, or about 4 hours before high water there. Its first direction is S. by E. for 2 hours, at from 2\\ to 3 knots ; it then turns to E.S.E. and the stream becomes imperceptible until high water in the harbour, when it again acquires strength, runs N.N.W., and ends in that direction H hours after. The ebb commences immediately and runs N.N.W. for 3 hours or until 4i hours after high water in the harbour ; it then turns to W.S.W. and ends in a S.W. direction a few minutes before the flood commences. At the northern entrance to the road, the streams follow the same course, but the flood does not end until 2 hours after high water. The ebb runs N.N.W. during 2^ or 3 hours, and then turns W.S.W. and S.S.W. When the tide is out in the harbour, the ebb runs S.S.W. from 1^ to 2 knots, and it ends in this direction a little before the flood stream commences at this spot, or about 4 hours before high water in the harbour. Vessels running into this road at low water should be aware of this stream of tide when passing the shoal patches. Grande Rade. \u2014 The flood stream begins to be felt in the Grande Rade about 4 hours before high water at Havre. An hour later, it runs S. by W. about 3 knots, and continues to run towards the Seine until 2\\ hours before high water ; its direction is then E.S.E., losing little of its strength, and then E.N.E. In the latter direction, its rate See chart, No. 2,680."], [525, "Chap. X.] 497 HAVRE. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. increases to 2^ or 3 knots at the time of high water in the harbour ; it then decreases in strength and ends about 2 hours after, running N.E. by N. The ebb commences almost as soon as the flood ends, slack water lasting only about a quarter of an hour at springs. This stream turns round by West, and about 3 hours after high water its direction is N.W., but it does not attain its greatest strength of 2\\ knots until it runs W.S.W., or about 5 hours after high water ; it then slackens gradually as it turns to the southward, where it ends. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 Steamers. \u2014 The main entrance to Havre for vessels, either from the direction of the Grande rade or from Carosse road, is by the Passe du Sud, which leads between the Haut de Quarante and the Haut du Sud-Ouest, has nothing less than 7 feet water, and leads directly towards the opening between the jetties The only precaution necessary, except to be watchful as to the effect of the eddies, as explained presently, is to pass at least 5 cables southward of No. 7 buoy and close to No. 6 buoy, for which a good leading mark is Frileuse chimney in line with the salient angle of the west bastion of La Floride. When past No. 6 buoy, it is well to keep a little more eastward in order to maintain the best depth of water, and also to gain the best line on which to enter the harbour. By night, the leading mark is, Grand quai and South jetty lights in line N.E. by E. \\ E. To attain this line, a vessel should pass 5 or 6 cables southward of the light-buoy Nord du Mouillage, and when close up to the jetties on the leading line, should sheer a little to port to enter in mid-channel. There is no difficulty in entering the basins by night, as they are lighted by electricity. Sailing vessels. \u2014 Although steam navigation is so largely in the ascendant at this port, and even for sailing vessels the services of steam-tugs are always available, yet to those who prefer to enter independently of these aids the following directions will be useful, observing that no stranger should attempt it without a pilot. Vessels arriving off the port some hours before the tide serves, should remain outside the banks off the entrance until the tide has risen sufficiently to pass over them. The stream runs into the Seine from the com mencement of the flood until 2 hours before high water ; but, there is no fear of being drawn into the river if vessels keep westward of See chart, No. 2,680."], [526, "498 [Chap. X. ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. the line of cape de la Heve lighthouses in one bearing N.E. \u00a3 N., or if cape d'Antifer is kept a few degrees open westward of cape de la Heve ; taking care at the same time not to go southward of the line of the Chateau d'Orcher, which stands near the shore about 2 miles eastward of Harfleur, on with the projecting angle of the wall enclosing the Floride basin bearing E. i S. With a fresh breeze from W.N.W. round by North to E.S.E., there is no difficulty in turning to windward and keeping a position ; but, with all other winds, keep as near as possible to the line of the chateau and the Floride wall in one, because at about 2 hours before high water in the harbour, when the Seine is nearly^ filled, the flood stream turns to E.S.E., losing part of its strength, and then to N.E. In the latter direction, it runs with the same velocity as when it ran up the Seine, and retains it until nearly 2\\ hours after high water ; should a sailing vessel, at that time, be so far northward as the parallel of cape de la Heve, it would be almost impossible for her to reach the harbour in time to get in. With strong winds from N.N.W. round by West to W.S.W., it is necessary to keep under sail 6 or 8 miles to windward of the harbour until there is sufficient water to enter ; but, with moderate winds from S.W. round by South to E.N.E., during calm weather, or at the times of the freshets of the Seine, it is better to anchor in Carosse road, southward of the prohibited anchorage, see page 496, or, between that road and the line of the Chateau d'Orcher on with the projecting angle of La Floride wall. Vessels can always get into harbour from the anchorage in the Petite Rade even during light or head winds. When vessels of deep draught have failed in entering, and the direction of the wind and late hour of the tide do not permit a second attempt, they should at once run out of the Seine ; but small vessels may take shelter under Hoc point, see page 505, whilst the tide is high. Tidal eddies. \u2014 The flood stream entering the Seine, crosses the direction of the entrance channel into Havre at right angles, making great care necessary even with steamers, and rendering access to the harbour for a sailing vessel very difficult under certain circumstances, which should be understood. The North jetty projects into the strength of the flood stream and occasions an eddy, the strength and extent of which depend on the velocity of that stream and on the range of the tide. About 3 hours See chart, No. 2,680."], [527, "Chap. X.] 499 HAVRE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 TIDAL EDDIES. before high water, when the stream begins to acquire its greatest strength, which is 4 or 5 knots at springs, the eddy extends as far as Heure bay, and forms, along the shores of that bay and along the walls of La Floride, a rapid counter stream, of which one portion turns round the end of the South jetty and enters the harbour, whilst the other runs sharply against the North jetty, along which it forms a disturbed eddy. This action of the streams continues until about 1^ hours before high water in the harbour ; but, at this time, the Seine, being nearly full, can no longer receive all the water running towards it from all points of the estuary, the stream here accordingly slackens, whilst towards the left bank, where the flood follows nearly the same direction as if the Seine did not exist or was barred off, the stream, not finding any issue upwards, crosses the Seine obliquely north eastward ; this direction, however, soon changes and becomes more northerly as the river fills. When this cross stream has reached Hoc point, a portion runs along shore westward and produces the stream named the Verhaule, which, at the entrance of Havre, takes the same direction as the eddy on the flood, just described, and immediately follows it, but in much greater volume, the Verhaule passing round the North jetty and running to the North-west. The effect of these different eddy streams on the flood tide, is to raise a high and confused sea at the entrance of the harbour when it blows strongly from the westward. The Verhaule, of which a part enters the harbour, is in fact the last part of the rising tide ; but, it runs in an opposite direction to the stream during the first hours of that tide and helps to keep vessels in the entrance channel, thus facilitating the entrance of sailing vessels with westerly winds. Its greatest strength is about three quarters of an hour before high water, and it continues to run until high water, when it decreases gradually and is hardly per ceptible at the end of slack water. The ebb then commences, and at first is feeble, but, in an hour's time, it gains strength and runs towards the North and N.N.W. in the same direction as the Verhaule when near its end. The deviation of the flood stream, occasioned by each of the pro jecting angles of the quays bordering the entrance, is another difficulty in entering Havre, especially if a vessel has entered before the basins and harbour are filled. See chart, No. 2,680."], [528, "500 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. [Chap. X. It appears, therefore, that for vessels generally, if intending to remain in the outer harbour, the best time to enter is at high water slack, but this is rather too late for those entering the basins. They, on the contrary, should enter as soon as the tide serves, so as to have time to secure before the beginning of the ebb. The anchors should be ready for letting go before entering, and one should be placed conveniently for anchoring by the stern ; warps and hawsers also should be coiled clear for use on deck and ready to run out in case of need. The best time of tide for a sailing vessel to enter, must however depend greatly on the direction of the wind. With a fresh westerly wind, she may run in even whilst the counter stream along the walls of La Floride is at its greatest strength, care being taken to keep in mid-channel so as not to drift on the North jetty. With fresh winds between W.S.W. and N.N.W., the Verhaule causes a violent sea, and it is then best not to enter until the end of slack water, when the sea is rather less confused and the tide slack in the entrance channel. With the wind sufficiently strong between S.S.W. and E.S.E. to stem the tide, she may enter before the Verhaule commences. Should the wind, however, be between E.S.E. and N.E., it is advisable to secure the services of a steam-tug, the arrangements for tracking vessels formerly in vogue having been entirely- superseded by towing. Boats are always ready at the entrance and in the har bour to run out warps for hauling the vessel into her berth as may be necessary. To Havre from the Westward. \u2014 Generally speaking, in a sailing vessel, the direction of the wind met with in the entrance of the Channel should determine the choice of the landfall to be made in order to take a fresh departure for Havre, see also Directions page 412. With the wind from E.N.E. round by North to W.S.W., the English coast should be made between the Lizard and Portland Bill, but not eastward of the Bill, for, should the wind then back more to the southward, it would be impossible, for a sailing vessel to fetch Havre with the flood stream running. As soon as the position of the vessel is ascertained, a course should be shaped to sight, cape Barfleur lighthouse. Steamers from the southward in clear weather, generall y endeavour to sight TJshant ; see directions for rounding that island at page 18. See chart, No. 2,680."], [529, "501 Chap. X.] HAVRE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. The points of the French coast which should then be sought for in succession are : \u2014 the high land between TJshant and ile de Bas ; Guernsey, a sight of which assists in making or clearing the Casquets ; and lastly, Alderney, and the high land at the back of cape de la Hague. If this passage is adopted, however, great attention must be paid to the tidal streams when running between the ile de Bas and Guernsey, as the ship's course crosses their direction nearly at right angles. During the ebb there is no danger, as that stream runs towards the N.N.W., but the flood sets strongly into the gulf of St. Malo and is very rapid at springs. At 10 miles from the coast between TJshant and ile de Bas, the flood or east-going stream ends about 2^ hours after high water by the shore. As Guernsey and the Casquets are approached, the greatest care must be taken to keep well clear of them, the rate of the flood stream between them being from 4 to 5 knots, at springs ; a vessel should therefore always pass well westward and only just within sight of the Casquets. When north-westward of the Casquets, follow the directions given at page 372, until eastward of cape de la Hague, to avoid the race of Alderney and the strong tides in that neighbourhood ; and, from thence, the course is about E.S.E. to make cape Barfleur lighthouse, taking care to keep from 3 to 6 miles from the shore in order to avoid the numerous dangers which border it. By whatever route a vessel has come, when cape Barfleur light house or the high land at Pernelle is made out, a course should be shaped to make the land between cape de la Heve and cape d'Antifer, or direct for the former cape, according as the wind inclines from the northward or southward. After passing cape Barfleur and having entered the bay of the Seine, the first land seen when steering as described will be that which bounds the estuary of the Seine on either side. The high land of the plain of Caux should be ahead and on the port bow, terminating towards the coast in chalk cliffs of dazzling whiteness, which, when lighted up by the sun, are plainly distinguished 21 miles distant ; and, on the starboard hand to the southward, will be the hills bordering the left bank of the Seine from Honfleur to. the river Dives; their rounded shape, and especially their dark colour, distinguish them from those to the northward. See chart, No. 2,680."], [530, "[Chap. X. 502 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. When the meridian of cape Barfleur is crossed towards the com mencement of the flood, that is, about 5^ or 6 hours before high water at Havre, see table, page 425, a vessel with a leading wind may arrive off Havre in time to save the tide. On passing the meridian of Barfleur at the commencement of the ebb, or about one hour after high water at Havre, a course should be shaped for cape d'Antifer and only sufficient sail carried to stem the tide, which, in the middle of the bay, runs 3i or 4 knots, at springs, about 4^ hours after high water at Havre. Should the position of Havre be made out before the commencement of the flood, sail must be so regulated as not to arrive off the harbour's mouth until there is sufficient water to enter. At night, with the wind between North and West, a course should be shaped from cape Barfleur to make the land between cape de la Heve and cape d'Antifer. The lights on tjjese capes with that of Fecamp are good guides to the vessel's position. To prevent her approaching too near the land, it should be borne in mind that Fecamp light is concealed by the high land at Etretat on an E. \u00a7 N. bearing, and, cape de la Heve lights, by the hills at Bleville when bearing S.W. | S. southerly. Fecamp light will not be lost sight of at the distance of 6 or 7 cables off cape d'Antifer, nor cape de la Heve lights at the same distance off-shore between cape d'Antifer and Cauville. Thus, should it be desired to maintain a position during the night by turning to wind ward between cape d'Antifer and Cauville, go about, when standing in for the land, the instant the lights on cape de la Heve disappear, and in standing off-shore during the flood, tack when Fecamp light reappears ; but, during the ebb, the off-shore board may be continued farther without inconvenience. With a moderate breeze and smooth water, a vessel may anchor on the line of Fecamp light eclipsed by the land, provided she is some miles southward of the parallel of cape d'Antifer. The holding ground is excellent as far as 5 miles off-shore between that cape and the Grand Rade, but nearer the shore, between Bleville guard-house and Cauville, the bottom is covered with heaps of large stones for 1\\ miles off-shore. It may be proper here to remark that between capes de la Heve and d'Antifer, at 4 or 5 miles from the shore, the stream, at springe, runs at the rate of 2 or 3 knots to the N.E. from 2 hours before to 2 hours after high water at Havre ; it then slackens and turns See chart, No. 2,680."], [531, "Chap. X.] 503 HAVRE. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. more northward, so that a vessel caught by a contrary wind when southward of cape d'Antifer, would be unable during that period to reach Havre by turning to windward close in-shore, but she may reach the Grande Rade by keeping at least 4 miles from the coast. During the freshets of the Seine, vessels intending to enter Havre must avoid being set northward of the parallel of cape de la Heve. When rounding cape Barfleur with a south-westerly wind, from a position about 6 miles northward of that cape, haul up S.E. by S. or S.E. to sight the Ver light ; and, when on its meridian, keep away two or three points to sight cape de la Heve lights and steer for the anchorage in the Grande rade ; or, with a pilot on board, Havre may be steered for if the tide serves, and sail so regulated as not to arrive off the harbour's mouth until there is sufficient water to enter, see directions page 497. With a head wind, long boards should be made across the bay of the Seine by day as well as by night, recollecting that the flood stream setting up the Seine ends in the bay nearly 2^ hours before high water at Havre. To Havre from the Eastward. \u2014 In clear weather, with the wind between North and East, the Pas de Calais channel, between the Ridge bank or Colbart and the French coast, may be taken, and from thence a S.W. | W. course leads between the Bassurelle and Vergoyer banks direct for cape d'Antifer ; Fecamp light will probably be seen before cape d'Antifer light in following this course, and is a good guide at night. This channel is also used in fine weather when the wind is between South and East, keeping 4 or 5 miles from cape Grisnez, and passing outside the Bassure de Baas bank. When southward of the river Somme, and westward of the meridian of Dieppe, the shore may be neared if necessary ; but, should the wind veer to S.W., a vessel should quit the French coast immediately and, if it increases to a gale, seek the sheltered anchorage in Dungeness East road. With the wind from N.N.W. round by West to W.S.W., the Dover channel between the Varne and the English coast should be used. From Beachy head, cape de la Heve bears S.S.W. 73 miles, and the passage with westerly winds is made more advantageously on the ebb than on the flood ; vessels, therefore, having held their own to windward, and in sight of Beachy head lighthouse, to the end of the flood, should then stretch across so as to arrive abreast of cape d'Antifer at the beginning of the following flood and in time to See chart, No. 2,680. 2 I SO1II886"], [532, "[Chap. X. 504 ESTUARY OF THE SEINE. enter Havre at high water. Either Fecamp or d'Antifer lights are excellent guides for the landfall on the French coast, and, in clear weather, the latter may be seen in a 15-miles run after Beachy head light has been lost sight of. TANCARVILLE CANAL.\u2014 The Tancarville canal connects the Bassin de l'Eure at Havre with the little port of Harfleur, 3\u00a3 miles to the eastward, and with the river Seine at Tancarville, its total length being about 14 miles. In the first section between Havre and Harfleur, the dimensions are, depth, 19 feet ; width at bottom, 62 feet ; width at surface, 162 feet. In the second section, between Harfleur and Tancarville, depth, 11^ feet ; width at bottom, 81 feet ; width at surface, 168 feet. Sea-going vessels for the first section and for the branch leading up to Harfleur must not exceed 46 feet beam ; those for the second section, 36 feet beam. Trains of barges in tow through the second section and bound for the Seine and inner navigation must not exceed 36 feet beam, or a total length of 558 feet. The smallest of the three locks at the Havre entrance of the canal is the central lock ; it is 585 feet long, and 97| feet wide ; the entrance gates of all have a uniform width of 52 feet, with 19^ feet over the sills. The lock communicating with the Seine at Tancarville is of the same dimensions as the smallest lock at Havre, but its eastern sill is one foot 9 inches above the zero of soundings ; its western sill 6 inches below that zero. Vessels drawing 7 feet can enter or leave the Tancarville lock, at springs, from one hour before to four hours after the time of high water at Havre ; at neaps, from two hours before to four hours after high water at Havre. The channel between the lock and the Seine is maintained approximately at the zero depth. The canal has several sidings, and is crossed by some swing bridges ; it is used almost exclusively by barges for Rouen and the upper waters of the Seine. Its navigation presents no difficulties and is conducted in accordance with efficient regulations, one of which enjoins that a maximum speed of 5 knots shall be strictly observed in order to avoid injury to the embankments. Harfleur. \u2014 This little port is on the river Lizarde which formerly ran into the Seine near Hoc point, but now flows into the Tancarville canal, westward of the artificial cutting, which forms the port and connection with the canal, and which is maintained at a depth of 19| feet with a bottom width of 62 feet.

Heure bay. \u2014 Between Havre and Hoc point, the shore and adjacent land of the estuary of the Seine is low, but defended against the sea by an artificial embankment abutting the wall which encloses the southern part of Havre as far as the middle of Heure bay, and, from thence to Hoc point, by a high natural beach of shingle. Heure bay seems to have been hollowed out by the violent eddy during the flood previously described, and is filled with shingle cemented together with mud, which uncovers from 9 to 13 feet at low water. In bad weather, whatever the direction of the wind, the sea breaks directly on the shore during the flood, and any vessel then missing the entrance to Havre and driving on shore in this bay would to a certainty be totally wrecked. Hoc point. \u2014 This low point, composed of a mass of rolled shingle, is 3^ miles eastward of Havre, and H miles S.S.W. of Harfleur. It may be recognized by two large houses built to serve as a lazaretto, by the old disused light tower, still maintained as a landmark, and by a guard-house about 200 yards from it. The point projects considerably from the shore and occasions a strong eddy during the flood. This eddy stirs up the sand and hollows out a deep, the extent and depth of which are variable ; but, small vessels intending to ascend the Seine, may lie aground without danger, sheltered by the point, and await a favourable tide. The bottom in this deep is sand and shingle, and vessels are moored securely as near as possible to either of its sides. The eddy on the flood is troublesome and the ebb stream very rapid. A good anchorage to await tide may be found a cable from the shore south-westward of Hoc point, with Harfleur steeple seen between the two warehouses of the lazaretto, but it is not safe for vessels to go there before three hours flood, nor to remain there after three hours ebb. These anchorages have, however, lost their importance since the entrance to Harfleur ceased to be by way of Hoc point. THE COAST.\u2014 From cape de la Heve, the coast trends N.E. \\ N. northerly 11 miles to cape d'Antifer, and consists of chalk cliffs with strata of flint from 320 to 370 feet high, which, with on-shore winds, See charts. Nos. 2,680 and 2,146. 2 12 SO 11886"], [534, "506 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [Chap. X. have no accessible spot. Between cape de la Heve and the little valley of St. Jouin, 8^ miles farther northward, the crown of the cliffs only is perpendicular, enormous masses of flint shattered down from the cliffs above being banked up against them. It is supposed that the action of the sea causes a constant movement of these masses southward along the coast, and that they have largely contributed to form the banks south-westward of cape de la Heve, which obstruct the approaches to Havre and the Seine. Northward of St. Jouin, the cliffs, including cape d'Antifer, to be described with its lighthouse and semaphore in the next chapter, are quite perpendicular, the sea washing their base, and in the afternoon when lighted up by the sun their brightness is so dazzling that they may be seen 21 miles distant. Tidal Streams. \u2014 The peculiarities of the tidal streams in the Baie de la Seine and the tendency of the flood stream of the Baie acting in conjunction with the channel flood streams to cause the Bore in the river Seine have already been fully described at page 466. It only remains here to remark that the estuary of the Seine being the point towards which these streams flow, it quickly fills, and the water within having attained the level of that without, the streams cease running towards the estuary and take an E.N.E. and N.E. direction for the remaining two hours of the east-going channel stream, as described with reference to Havre Grande and Petite rades at page 496. The stream, in fact, then takes the direction it would have naturally followed from the commencement of the tide if the Seine had not existed. The ebb or west-going stream in the interior of the bay, when at its greatest strength, runs in the opposite direction to the flood ; but, northward of the line drawn from cape Barfleur to cape d'Antifer, its direction is W. by N. The windings of the coast modify the direction of both streams near the shore, and, behind each projecting point, there is an eddy depending on the strength of the tide for its extent. During springs, the east-going is more rapid than the west-going stream. The former commences suddenly and is not long in gaining strength ; the latter, on the contrary, is slower in establishing itself. When stream and wind are in the same direction, the rate and duration of the stream is increased in proportion to the strength of the wind ; but, when the wind blows from a direction opposite to the stream, it has little effect on it.

ASPECT OF COAST.\u2014 Cape Grisnez bears from cape d'Antifer N.E. | E. 89 miles, the coast between forming a bight to the South-east, 106 miles in circuit and receding 24 miles from a line connecting the two points. The high cliffs of chalk and flint, described in the preceding chapter, extend from cape de la Heve to within about 4 miles north-eastward of Treport, near the town of Ault, and beyond them commences a low coast fronted by a sandy beach on which three wide valleys open out and give issue to the waters of the rivers Somme, Authie, and Canche. This low coast extends to within about 4 miles of Boulogne ; the land then rises abruptly and the shore con tinues steep, with a few exceptions, as far as cape Grisnez. The harbours between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez, wioh the exception of Fecamp, Dieppe, and Boulogne, dry at spring tides, and are inacces sible to vessels of deep draught at neaps.* The cliffs between cape d'Antifer and Ault are precipitous, their foot resting upon a narrow shelf of rock covered at all times of tide. The ports of Fecamp, St. Valery-en-Caux, Dieppe, and Treport, at about equal distances from each other, are at the entrances of wide valleys forming breaks in the line of cliffs. The land crowning the cliffs is for the most part level in its whole extent, but the monoto nous aspect of the coast is varied by towns and villages near the sea, and by the verdure of the sides and bottoms of the valleys, which contrasts strongly with the uniform white of the cliffs. As the * See Admiralty charts : \u2014 English channel, No. 2,675\u00ab ; North coast of France, sheet XI. and XII., cape Levi to Fecamp, and Fecamp to Boulogne, Nos. 2,613 and 2612 ; scale, ;\u00ab = 05 of an inch : also Havre to river Durdent, No. 2,146, and river Durdent to Cayeux, No. 2,147 ; scale, m = 0'97 inch ; Cayeux to Boulogne, No. 2,148 ; scale, in \u2014 ) -0 inch ; and, Dungeness to the Thames, including Dover strait, No. I,sa5 ; scale, in, =0'6S inch."], [537, "Chap. XI.] 509 COAST. \u2014 CAUTION. \u2014 APPROACH. openings of all the valleys are dissimilar in some points, it is easy to distinguish them from each other, even from a considerable distance in the offing. The cliffs remarkable for their height are, that of Fagnet point, the northern point of entrance to the valley of Fecamp, on which stands a chapel dedicated to Notre Dame du Salut and Fecamp lighthouse ; the Butte du Catellier, with a small mound on its summit, which forms the western side of the Pallud, a wide valley watered by the Durdent river ; the cliff of St. Leger, three quarters of a mile westward of St. Valery-en-Caux, marked by a church tuwer and spire, the only remaining parts of the church ; the cliff of Sotteville, rendered remarkable by a large guard-house and a heavy looking church tower overtopping a row of trees ; and, the cliff at Criel, 3^ miles south-westward of Treport, which is the highest of all and is surmounted by Mont Joli-Bois, a large mound covered with heath. CAUTION. \u2014 When hugging the coast with off-shore winds, vessels must be on their guard against the squalls which rush down the valleys ; the most violent are felt abreast of the openings which do not reach down to the beach. The entrances of the rivers Somme, Authie, and Canche, are in the low land which extends over a space of 35 miles, from half a mile north-eastward of Ault to the foot of the hills of which the most western parts form cape Alprech ; they are all obstructed by banks of shifting sand which extend far outside their openings and dry at low water, springs. Approaching the Coast.\u2014 The shore between cape d'Antifer and point d'Ailly, about 5 miles westward of Dieppe, is without danger, and large vessels may coast it at a distance of 1\u00a3 miles ; but, eastward of this point, the approach to the shore is dangerous for vessels of deep draught, for, from the meridian of point d'Ailly to that of Treport, are banks of sand and shells, called Ridens or ridges, some of them lying as much as 11 miles from the shore ; and, eastward and northward of these, is the shoal bottom forming the base of the shifting sands obstructing the mouths of the Somme, Authie, and Canche rivers, which extends even northward of the latter. Outside these shoals, and towards the middle of the Channel, are several long submarine sand-banks converging in direction towards Set charw, Nos. 2,613 and 2,612."], [538, "[Chap. XI. 510 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. cape Grisnez. These banks lie generally about E.N.E. and W.S.W., nearly in the direction of the tidal streams ; but the Ridens lie N.N.W. and S.S.E. in a direction perpendicular to the banks and consequently across the streams. The greater part of these Ridens need be avoided only on account of the eddies they occasion, but there are spots with only 2 or 3 fathoms on some of the Ridens and on several of the banks, which are therefore very dangerous for large vessels at all times, while some are so only at low water. During spring tides, the eddies are very strong at the steep edges of these banks and Ridens, and in bad weather, or with a fresh breeze on a weather tide, small vessels crossing them subject themselves to a dangerous sea. CAUTION.\u2014 During strong winds from W.S.W. round by West to N.N.W. the coast eastward of point d'Ailly is dangerous to be near, and shipwrecks are of frequent occurrence ; vessels therefore of every description at such times should keep a good offing, and when obliged to approach the shore, must do so with great caution ; for, although the general mass of the bank described appears to be stationary, great attention should be paid to the lead and to observing the confused state of the sea in the various eddies, so as to guard against meeting suddenly with dangers which may be of recent formation. The lights indicating the positions of headlands and dangers on and between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez, are so disposed that at night, in clear weather, two can always be seen at a time, and all the harbours show tide lights whilst there is sufficient water for them to be entered. It is important to notice that near the shore, between cape de la Heve and the town of Ault, a space of 67 miles, the wind, when it blows in a direction perpendicular or nearly so to the direction of the coast-line, does not blow home but is reflected by the cliffs, and its effect is to a certain extent neutralized for some distance towards the offing. Thus, except in front of the wide valleys where the direct wind meets with no obstacle, a zone is formed off and parallel with the shore, where the wind is light but the sea much agitated and the waves run towards the shore. On the other hand, when the wind forms an acute angle with the coast, the reflected wind tends to increase the force of the direct wind near the shore. CAPE D'ANTIFER, as already noticed, differs but little from the adjacent land, except in the change in direction of the coast-line See chart, No. 2,146."], [539, "Chap. XL] WINDS, CAUTION. \u2014 CAPE D'ANTIFER. \u2014 ETRETAT. 511 which there takes place. The cape is rounded and terminates in a perpendicular chalk cliff 320 feet high, of which the foot is washed by the sea ; in clear weather it may be seen 21 miles distant. LIGHT. \u2014 From a cylindrical lighthouse 85 feet high, erected near the extreme of cape d'Antifer, and at 394 feet above the level of high water, is exhibited a powerful flashing white light, visible 27 miles. The light has a period of twenty seconds ; each flash showing for two seconds, followed by an eclipse of eighteen seconds. Fog Signal. \u2014 From the upper gallery of the lighthouse, in thick or foggy weather, a siren gives two blasts every two minutes, thus : \u2014 blast, three seconds ; silence, three seconds ; blast, three seconds ; silence, one hundred and eleven seconds. See Fog signals, page 11. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station a short distance southward of the lighthouse ; see page 12. Telegraph cable. \u2014 A telegraph cable leaves the shore a short distance northward of cape d'Antifer, and crosses the channel to Beachy head. Vessels of any draught may approach to within 2 or 3 cables of cape d'Antifer without danger, even at low water ; from cape d'Antifer, the coast trends about E. by N. 9 miles to Fecamp, and may be approached to about 4 cables. ETRETAT, a large fishing village and fashionable watering place, with a standing population of about 2,000, is on the shore at the entrance of a wide valley open to the North-west, and has railway communication with Fecamp ; the houses are built on low land defended from the incursions of the sea by a natural high shingle beach, up which the fishermen' heave their boats out of reach of the surf by means of capstans; the beach is backed in the neighbourhood of the casino by pavement in masonry. Semaphore. \u2014 On the north-eastern cliffs of the little bay of liltretat is a Semaphore station ; see page 12. The cliffs both eastward and westward of Etretat are very remarkable. They form sharp projecting points with openings in them resembling arches and doorways. Half a cable south-westward of the point, and westward of the village, is the Aiguille d'Etretat, a See chart, No. 2,146."], [540, "[Chap. XI. 512 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. high rock, or rather the remains of fallen cliff, so named from its pyramidal form. The eastern part of the beach at Etretat is bordered by rocks which uncover at low water. Abreast of Etretat, the shoal bottom, with less than 8 fathoms, extends a mile off-shore, and, when the flood stream is at its greatest strength, a great eddy, named by local mariners the Hardiers, is formed and extends eastward as far as the Vaudieurock, making the sea hollow and heavy when the wind is fresh from the eastward. Between Etretat and Iport, at 1^ miles from Etretat point, called also the Porte Orientate, and less than a cable from the cliffs, is the Guillemot rock, which resembles a ruined column and rises 160 feet above the rocks which uncover along the shore. Half way between this rock and the Porte Orientale, but a little nearer the cliffs than the Guillemot, is the great Vaudieu rock about 53 feet high, with a one-fathom patch just outside it. These two rocks, like the Aiguille d'Etretat, seem to be the remains of ancient cliffs. The base of the Guillemot is so worn by the sea that it is probable it may fall ere long. IPORT, a fishing village and watering-place, A-\\ miles eastward of Etretat and W. by S. f S. 2^ miles from the entrance to Fecamp, stands, like Etretat, at the entrance of a valley on low land near the sea, and is sheltered by a natural high shingle beach, strengthened by a small stone jetty, with a beacon at the end, and sea wall of masonry. The beach in front of the village is encumbered by rocks which uncover at low water, and is not accessible to fishing-boats until after the first hour's flood. The bluff point of Chicart with the rocks at its foot, affords a little shelter to the beach against westerly winds, but it is quite open northward, and when the sea is high the boats are hauled up on the beach. Harbour lights. \u2014 The channel leading to the grounding place at Iport is indicated by two small fixed white lights, maintained byr the town, which should be kept in line. A life-boat is stationed at Iport. FECAMP, of which the population is about 13,000, is a commercial, fishing, and refitting port of some importance ; it is 9 miles eastward of cape d'Antifer, at the entrance of a fine valley watered by the rivers Valmont and Ganzeville. It consists of an See chart, No. 2,146, and plan of Fecamp, No. 2,610 ; scale, m = 4-9 inches."], [541, "Chap. XL] IPORT. \u2014 FECAMP.\u2014 DEPTH. 513 Avant-port or tidal harbour, and two Bassins-a-flot or wet docks, one of which is not quite completed, the other is named the Berigny dock. The Avant-port is divided into two distinct parts, the older portion forming the approach to the Berigny dock ; the other, called also the Gayant tidal basin, forms the channel to the half -tide basin and to the new Bassin-a-flot. The entrance is open to N.W. by W., and is between two stone jetties at the foot of the high cliff forming Fagnet point. The jetty heads bear N.N.E. \u00a3 E. and S.S.W. \u00a3 W. from each other and are 76 yards apart, the channel between them is about 350 yards long, and narrows towards the inner end. The South jetty extends from the natural high shingle beach which shelters the harbour, and arresting the progress of the shingle along the coast from the South west, compels it to take a direction outwards from the entrance. The North jetty, 326 feet long, is built on the rocks which uncover at the foot of Fagnet point, and forms a continuation of the quay on the northern side of the harbour. The outer portion of both jetties is now nearly straight instead of curved as formerly. The Depth in the entrance channel is always greater than inside the harbour, and dredging is in progress, by which, assisted by flushing, it is hoped to maintain a depth of 5 feet below the zero of soundings, see page 4. The actual depths at high water, springs, as reported in 1895, were : \u2014 In the channel, 31 feet ; at the Berigny dock gate, 32 feet ; in the Berigny dock, 23 feet ; in the Avant port generally, nearly 30 feet. At dead neap tides 63 feet should be deducted from these for the high water depths. Only a very small portion of the Avant-port dries 2 feet at the lowest tides, but the channels through have the depths named. The port accommodates with ease steamers 320 feet long with a draught of water of 21 feet. The back water of Fecamp is very powerful for scouring out the channel when required, and it can be done both through the Gayant tidal basin and the Berigny dock. The sluices can always maintain the channel leading up to the lock gates of the Berigny dock, which, like the entrance channel, was originally deepened by removing the rocky bottom to a depth of 6 feet below the lowest tides ; it is the bed of sand which forms in the entrance channel over this rocky bottom that has to be removed when necessary by dredging. Tidal harbour. \u2014 The Avant-port, forming the approach to the Berigny dock, is If cables long N.E. and S.W. by one cable wide. See plan, No. 2,610."], [542, "514 [Chap. XL CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. A high and strong natural dike of shingle cemented with mud forms its western side ; its other sides are bordered by quays which are, however, not much used except by fishing-boats, as a fresh westerly wind causes sufficient surf to distress vessels moored along them. Several white warping buoys are moored in this harbour. The bottom for the most part is a mixture of chalky mud, sand, and gravel, and affords a tolerably good bed for grounding on. The Gayant basin communicates directly with the entrance to the port byr a passage 97 feet wide. Vessels lie here in perfect safety on good soft berths alongside its quays, and a channel 5 feet deep at the lowest tides has been dredged up to the sill of the half-tide basin which puts the Gayant basin in communication with the new Bassin-a-flot. The Berigny dock is south-eastward of the Avant port and south- west ward of the Gayant basin. It is 405 yards long in a S.E. \\ E. direction from its entrance and 110 yards wide ; the bottom is of gravel cemented together by mud. It is surrounded by quays on which are steam cranes travelling on rails and all conveniences for loading and unloading. It communicates with the Gayant basin by a lock 33 feet wide with 23 feet over the sill at high water, springs ; and, with the Avant port, by a lock 54 feet wide with 32 feet over the sill at high water, springs. The new Bassin-a-flot, not yet completed, is 220 yards long by 60 yards wide. It is entered from the Gayant basin by a half-tide basin 220 yards long and 76 yards wide, both of whose gates have a width of 58g feet, and the sills have the same depth over them as the Berigny dock. The railway station is at the head of the Berigny dock ; it unites with the main line for Paris at Beuzeville. Fecamp is also now in communication with Etretat by rail. Havre is distant about 24 miles by road, but Fecamp has no regular steam communication by sea with any port. It has large fish-curing establishments, and building yards where the Newfoundland and other deep sea fishing craft are constructed, as also a grid iron 150 feet long, but no dry dock. Repairs to vessels, both wood and iron, can be effected, but only very moderate repairs to machinery. Though this port is capable of receiving the largest class of shipping, its trade is comparatively insignificant, and in the last ten years shows a decided decrease.

Strong westerly winds for several successive days raise the tides one or two feet higher in the harbour but cause a heavy sea at the entrance ; the contrary is the case with easterly winds. The streams do not run with any great strength, and it is nearly slack water outside at the time of high water in the harbour ; the duration of slack water in the harbour is not more than 15 or 20 minutes at the utmost. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual day tide signals are made from a flagstaff on the inner part of the South jetty ; night signals are also made from the same jetty ; see page 12. Pilots. \u2014 Four qualified pilots are stationed at Fecamp ; they have decked boats which can keep the sea in any weather ; their limits are, Saint-Jouin to -the south-westward, and Veulettes to the north eastward. Directions. \u2014 Fecamp harbour is not generally difficult to enter, but it is dangerous when it blows strongly from the westward on account of the heavy sea off the entrance ; for, should a vessel then miss the harbour and ground on the rocks off Fagnet point, she would be totally lost. If the weather is doubtful, look out for the signal as to whether the harbour is practicable, see pages 11 and 13, and, if not, haul off at once. A steam-tug is stationed at the port and every assistance is given to warp or track vessels in or out, boats and men being always ready at the entrance when the weather permits. Vessels arriving off the harbour towards low water, with the wind between W.S.W. and W.N.W., should steer for the land about Etretat, and keep to windward of the harbour until the tide serves to run in. With the wind between N.N.W. and E.N.E., the land should be made about Vattetot and Iport ; and, if the wind should come off shore and there is a chance of losing the tide, anchorage may be found about H miles from the coast near the meridian of Iport in 10 fathoms water, and tolerably good holding-ground, with the Aiguille d'Etretat on with the Porte Orientate, and the bell tower of the abbaye at Fecamp on with the last slope of the hills a little southward of the houses of the town.

XL] FECAMP. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 COAST. 517 three hours before high water, a vessel might anchor closer in-shore but in such a position that she may be able to fetch the entrance of the harbour. These anchorages, however, are only good for a few hours, unless the weather is quite fine. Sailing vessels should endeavour to enter Fecamp harbour about an hour before high water, at which time the eastern stream is running across the jetty -heads about 1\\ knots, so that in approaching the entrance on the starboard tack a vessel requires to be well to windward or she may fall to leeward of the North jetty and miss the port. With a fair wind, or when close hauled, sufficient sail should be carried to get quickly into harbour, and it should be so balanced that the vessel answers her helm well. In heavy weather, the worst sea is from 250 to 350 yards outside the jetty-heads. With the wind from N.W. or N.E., squalls and baffling winds, caused by the high lands, are very apt to occur when in the entrance channel. The method generally adopted when entering the harbour with a fair wind without the steam-tug, is to stand fairly in between the jetties, then clew up and the vessel will be tracked up to her berth. If not intending to enter the Berigny dock, the harbour need not be entered before high water. Caution. \u2014 Care must be taken on quitting Fecamp harbour with a westerly wind, to avoid being drifted by the flood stream on the Charpentiers shoals, which join the rocks at Fagnet point and extend westward as far as the line of St. Leonard's spire on with the North jetty-head, S. by W. f W. To pass well outside the swell caused by these shoals, keep Grinval valley open, so that the new guard-house may appear above the middle of the cleft by which the descent is made to the beach. THE COAST from Fecamp trends E. by N. i N. 10 miles to Butte du Catellier and then East 5 miles to St. Valery-en-caux, and consists of the high perpendicular cliffs of chalk and flint, before described, intersected by numerous valleys, of which the greater part do not reach down to the level of the beach. A shelf of irregular rocks, which uncovers at low water, borders the shore, but no part of' it projects farther than about 3 cables from the cliffs, so that large vessels may approach within 5 cables of the shore at any time of tide. See plan, No. 2,610, and chart, No. 2,146."], [546, "518 [Chap. XL CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. The appearance of this part of the coast is dull and uniform ; the land seen above the cliffs is apparently level and only varied by occasional clumps of trees surrounding farms and villages. Above these trees occasionally appear church towers, the most conspicuous being those of Senneville, Sassetot, St. Martin-aux-Bunaux, Conteville. and St. Leger ; the last named stands near the edge of the cliff three quarters of a mile westward of St. Valery, has a tall isolated spire, and may be seen from a great distance in the offing. ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX, a town of 4,200 inhabitants, has a small bar harbour and is at the entrance of a narrow valley between high hills. It is the terminus of a branch railway which puts it in communication with the general system of the country ; its trade is, however, small, the annual entry of tonnage being about 13,000 and not increasing. Mackerel, herring, and cod fisheries are carried on ; and coals, Baltic and Norway timber, wine, brandy, &c, are imported, vessels usually leaving in ballast. Entrance channel. \u2014 The port consists of a channel between two jetties of unequal length, leading into a small tidal harbour, and of a reservoir for backwater, a part of which serves as a wet dock. The western jetty- is 377 yards long, including 129 yards of open pile work. The eastern jetty is 296 yards long but it is prolonged seaward about 220 yards by a breakwater. The jetty-heads bear from each other about N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. 100 yards, but the width between the jetties is only 65 yards at the outer part and 40 yards at the inner. The width of the navigable channel is still further reduced by the vast mass of shingle which collects inside the channel against the West jetty leaving a space of only about 22 yards, and and this space is with difficulty kept open along the East jetty by sluicing. The Tidal harbour is 3^ acres in extent, being about 220 yards long and 80 yards wide, and has quays on both sides, as well as a small building and repairing slip for fishing craft. The bottom is soft and good for grounding, but strong northerly winds send in so much sea as not only to break vessels away from their moorings but also to make it unsafe to open the lock gates into the wet dock. Vessels in the tidal harbour should be placed parallel with the quay, and the moorings watched as the scouring sluices are opened, for the rush of water is so violent as to undermine those which have grounded at right angles or diagonally to its direction. See charts, Nos. 2,146 and 2,147."], [547, "Cbap. XL] ST. VALERT-EN-CAUX.\u2014 BAR.\u2014 LIGHTS. 519 Depths. \u2014 The depth varies greatly according to the state of the bar, but as a rule 20 feet at high water, springs, and 13 or 14 feet at neaps, is the average depth through the entrance channel and tidal harbour up to the entrance of the wet dock, though this depth is by no means reliable in the very narrow inner part of the channel described. The berths alongside the quays of the tidal harbour have only 14 feet over them at high water, springs, and 6 or 7 feet less at neaps. The wet dock or Bassin-a-flot is a part of the flushing reservoir, 6 acres in size, the whole reservoir being 17\u00a3 acres ; it communicates with the tidal harbour by means of a small lock 138 feet long with sluice gates 32 feet wide ; its sill is 10 feet above the zero of soundings and has over it 17 feet at high water, springs, and 1H feet at neaps. The valley of St. Valery, of which the town and harbour occupy the entrance, is about 400 yards wide, and is at the head of a small bight in the coast. The rocky ledge which uncovers at the foot of the cliff along the shore has a natural opening through it in front of the valley, and the space between consists of a beach of chalky mud and cemented shingle 2^ cables wide, on which shingle, always working along from the westward, is deposited. The channel leading to the harbour runs through this beach, and its direction when between the jetties is about North and South. Bar. \u2014 The beach uncovers, during springs, one cable outside the western jetty, and the shingle borne from the westward forms on it a bar in front of the entrance, one end of which sometimes joins the West jetty-head, but generally leaves a channel from 40 to 50 yards wide between it and that jetty -head. The scouring water not having force enough to open a passage through the bar runs out generally by its eastern end. The bar rises if westerly winds continue, and a south westerly gale brings an enormous mass of shingle on the beach ; the higher the bar the more it extends north-eastward , forcing the outer part of the channel eastward. When strong easterly winds blow for any length of time, the surf drives the shingle from the entrance, lowering the bar and dividing it into several parts, and then by copious flushings the channel is sometimes completely cleared. LIGHTS.\u2014 West jetty.\u2014 From a tower 33 feet high at the West jetty-head is exhibited, from two hours before to two hours after high water, a fixed and flashing white light, the flash appearing at half- See chart.

East jetty. \u2014 A fixed red light, visible 2 miles, is shown from a lamp-post on the East jetty-head. Fog Signals. \u2014 At the West jetty-head, a bell gives 20 strokes in quick succession, followed by an interval of 20 seconds. A double stroke sounded in the middle of each interval denotes that there are 8^ feet or more in the entrance channel ; see fog signals, page 11. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual day tide signals, see page 12, are made from a mast on the West jetty ; the signalman also signals by hand the direction to take for the deepest water. Life-boat. \u2014 There is a life-boat, mortar apparatus, and other life saving appliances, at St. Valery-en-caux, in case of shipwreck. Pilots. \u2014 Three qualified pilots are stationed at this port ; they have, however, only open boats, and therefore cannot always get to sea, but, considering the varying depths and shifting nature of the bar, it need scarcely be said that no stranger should enter without a pilot. When the state of the sea prevents pilots boarding vessels outside, they attend on the jetties to signal the direction to be followed in order to round the bar and enter the channel. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the highest and most prominent point of the coast nearly a mile westward of the entrance to St. Valery-en-caux ; see page 12. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at St. Valery-en-caux at lfUi. 46m. ; springs rise 27 feet above the level of the soundings, neaps 21i feet. With fresh westerly winds, the water is from one to 2 feet higher, and, with easterly winds, a foot or two lower than the ordinary rise. During springs, when the outer shingle banks are all covered, the flood stream forms a great eddy in the elbow eastward of the jetties which runs westward along the shore of the elbow and along the outer side of the eastern jetty. This eddy, named the Sciade, much resembles the Verhaule at Havre ; a part of it, after rounding the East jetty-head, enters the entrance channel, whilst the principal portion, crossing the channel obliquely, runs along the West jetty and rounds its head as soon as the flood stream outside slacks, which Set chart, No. 2,117."], [549, "Chap. XL] ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX.\u2014 TIDES.\u2014 DIRECTIONS. 521 takes place about a quarter of an hour before high water. The eddy is usually more rapid with westerly than with easterly winds, and, with the former, when at its greatest strength shortly after high water, it assists to keep vessels in the channel. The east-going stream continues to be felt at a short distance outside the jetties for more than half an hour after high water in the harbour, and is a great inconvenience when entering with westerly winds, or when the sea is high, if the entrance round the West jetty-head happens to be closed and it is necessary to round the bar well to the eastward to get into the entrance channel. Directions. \u2014Vessels unable to enter St. Valery-en-caux harbour during neaps must keep at sea until springs, except with off-shore winds in fine weather, when they may anchor from 5 to 8 cables off shore, between the guard-house at Cinq Trous and St. Leger, in from 5 to 10 fathoms water, tolerably good holding-ground. Arriving off the entrance at springs, with only a few hours to wait for sufficient water, they should, with westerly winds, make short boards between Butte du Catellier and St. Leger, or if the wind is from the eastward they should maintain a position off the harbour. When standing in-shore, eastward of the entrance, care must be taken to keep Butte du Catellier well open northward of the point formed by the cliffs near Sussette valley, in order to avoid the Ridens, dangerous banks of sand and gravel E.N.E. 8 cables from the West jetty-head, on which are only 2 feet at low water, and a high sea during a weather tide. With a pilot on board there is no difficulty in entering the harbour, provided the entrance channel runs at the foot of the West jetty head where there is generally sufficient water at about 20 yards from the head half an hour before high water, and if the wind does not admit of sailing in between the jetties, a vessel will be tracked in by men always in attendance ; but, it is difficult of accees when the bar joins the West jetty-head, and the only channel open is northward and eastward of the bar. The most favourable moment to enter with westerly winds is when the Sciade or eddy is at its greatest strength, that is, from half an hour before to half an hour after high water ; the anchors should be clear and sufficient sail carried for the vessel to answer her helm quickly. With winds between North and East, it is advisable to enter before the Sciade has acquired its full strength, for fear of being drifted on See chart. No. 2.147. HI SO 11886"], [550, "[Chap. XI. 522 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. the West jetty. With northerly winds, there is a high sea on the bar and plenty of sail should be carried in crossing it, as the wind reflected by the cliffs decreases the force of the true wind, and if the broken water is not crossed rapidly, heavy seas may be shipped. There is not much difficulty in quitting the harbour, as it can only be attempted in moderate weather, but care must be taken to choose a favourable time of tide ; thus, with easterly winds, vessels should leave the jetty before high water, whilst the east-going stream has still much strength, but with westerly winds they should not leave until the west-going stream is well established. THE COAST. \u2014 From St. Valery-en-caux, the coast, a high per pendicular cliff of chalk and flint, trends East 15 miles to Dieppe ; point d'Ailly, 5 miles westward of Dieppe, extending northward of that line. The first projecting point, 5 miles eastward of St. Valery is that of Sotteville, which may be known at a great distance by a heavy-looking church tower rising above the trees of the village from which the point takes its name, and by a conspicuous guard house. The shelf of rock bordering the shore extends about 2 cables from this point, which should not be approached within 3^ cables by vessels hugging the coast with off-shore winds. Raz de St. Michel. \u2014 Between Sotteville point and point d'Ailly are three wide valleys, separated by high cliffs, occupy-ing half the interval between these points. The middle or St. Aubin's valley descends to the shore, and on its eastern side the waters of the river Dun open a passage through the shingle beach. The rocks which uncover at the foot of the cliffs extend 3 cables from the shore on both sides of this valley, and in front of it an irregular rocky bottom, with from 14 to 20 feet water, projects a mile from the shore. This extension, lying at right angles to the tidal streams, causes the raz or race of St. Michel, a strong eddy dangerous at low water to small vessels sailing near the coast with off-shore winds ; but the Butte du Catellier kept well open of the point formed by the cliffs near Sussette valley W. -} S. leads outside it. POINT D'AILLY is of a rounded form, and although not so high as many other points of the coast, may be easily recognised, as the perpendicular chalk cliff forms only half its height ; a thick bed of clay and vegetable mould, lying above the chalk, sloping down to the edge of the cliff.

The light is dioptric, of the first order, and is visible 24 miles. Fog Signal.\u2014 At 328 yards south-westward of the lighthouse, a steam trumpet gives two consecutive blasts every forty seconds, each blast lasting three seconds, with an interval of two seconds between ; the first blast is a high note, the second a low note ; see Fog Signals, page 11. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station at point d'Ailly, 329 yards S.W. \\ W. from the lighthouse ; tee page 12. Roches d'Ailly. \u2014 Whistle-buoy. \u2014 The shore eastward and westward of point d'Ailly, from the valley of Pourville to that of Quiberville, is bordered by the Roches d'Ailly, a bank consisting of blocks of freestone, which uncover at low water and terminate in a point 5 cables N.N.E. of the lighthouse, outside of which bank there are only from 5 to 5|, fathoms for some little distance. Here is moored a red automatic whistle-buoy, from which point d'Ailly lighthouse bears South PI miles. By night, a red sector of light, shown from Dieppe West-pier lighthouse, covers the whistle-buoy and also the whole space between it and the shore. The Galere, a rock with two heads, one of the roches d'Ailly, about 3 cables from the shore, but higher and larger than the rest, rises from the middle of the bank, and when its summit is covered there are about 21 or 2.2 feet water in the entrance to Dieppe. The square church tower of St. Jacques, at Dieppe, 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 open of the cliff on which are the ramparts of the castle bearing E. by S.

Grand and Petit Ecamias. \u2014 On the meridian of point d'Ailly, the western part of the Ridens, those heaps of sand and broken shells noticed at page 509, are found ; they extend 11 miles in the offing, and eastward as far as the meridian of Treport. The Ecamias, lying northward of point d'Ailly, are divided into two groups, and not having less than 7 fathoms water, with from 12 to 15 fathoms round them, they can only be dangerous from the heavy Set chart, No. 2,147."], [552, "[Chap. XL 524 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. sea on them in bad weather ; the Petit Ecamias, the northern group, lies 7 miles, and the Grand Ecamias, the southern group, 4 miles from the shore. Riden de Dieppe. \u2014 The Ridens generally are not dangerous except on account of the high sea in the eddies caused by them during a gale on a weather tide. The Riden de Dieppe, or Frilandais, however, which lies N.N.E. \u00a3 E. 10 miles from Dieppe entrance, is an exception to this rule, for vessels of deep draught might strike on it at low water, springs ; it is about 1^ miles in length N.N.W. and S.S.E., the highest part being 5 cables long, with from 23 to 27 feet water. As it is probable that these Ridens, being composed of substances easily set in motion, are liable to change their position, the mariner will act prudently when in their vicinity by keeping ata distance from any great eddies, their strength being generally in proportion to the shallowness of the water by which they are occasioned. The Tidal Streams follow the direction of the coast between St. Valery-en-caux and Dieppe, and their rate, at springs, is about 3-j knots ; but, near points Sotteville and d'Ailly they run 4 knots.* About the time the rocks off point d'Ailly begin to cover, an eddy stream setting westward, commences in-shore off Varengeville, and continues until the end of the flood. Under the lee of Dieppe jetties also, about a cable eastward of the entrance, a similar eddy is caused ; it runs westward close round the East jetty-head and joins the stream entering the harbour. Close in-shore the streams turn at high and low water, but a mile or two off-shore they run an hour or an hour and a half longer in each direction. The mean duration of the eastern stream is 5h. 40m., and of the western stream 6h. 45m., thus corresponding with the times of the rising and falling tides ; see page 529. THE COAST.\u2014 About 5 miles eastward of point d'Ailly is the entrance to Dieppe, the coast between forming a slight bay, near the centre of which is the village of Pourville, standing in the most remarkable valley on this part of the coast, it being the only one eastward of point d'Ailly that descends to the level of the beach ; it is watered by the little river Scic, which finds a passage through * From observations made in 1878 it would appear that the strength of the tidal streams in the immediate neighbourhood of Dieppe is at least one knot less than is here given.

DIEPPE.* \u2014 The entrance to this important commercial and fishing port lies E. \u00a3 S. 5 miles from point d'Ailly, and the town with its suburb, Le Pollet, occupies the entire width of a valley nearly a mile in extent, watered by the rivers Arques, Bethune, and Aure, which, united, flow into the south-eastern corner of the Inner port. The population of Le Pollet, which is eastward of Dieppe and connected with it by movable bridges, is chiefly engaged in the herring, oyster, and cod fisheries. The principal imports are coals, timber, pig iron and petroleum. The exports are manufac tured silks, Paris and Lyons goods, wines, spirits, fruits, vegetables, flints, &c. There are sugar refineries, rope-walks, ship yards, a gridiron in the Outer port, a heaving-down pontoon in the Berigny basin, and a graving dock, completed in 1896. The foreign and coasting trades are active, and, in 1895, 1637 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 430,754 tons entered the port. Steamers ply daily between Dieppe and Newhaven, two or three times a week with Grimsby, every ten days with Cardiff or Swansea, and bi-monthly with Christiania. Dieppe being on one of the main routes between London and Paris is in excellent and easy com munication with all parts of France ; the number of passengers by this route in 1895 was 153,320, and it steadily increases. The population is about 23,000. There is a good hospital to which foreign sailors are admitted on payment for medical attendance, and there is a British Seamen's reading room supported by voluntary contributions. The port consists of an entrance channel, Outer port or tidal harbour with an area of 21 acres, Inner port, also tidal and of about the same dimensions, and four wet docks or basins, viz. : \u2014 the Duquesne, Berigny, Half-Tide, and Floating basins.

[Chap. XI the Inner port. The inner part of the channel is enclosed between the northern quays of the town and Le Pollet suburb. The channel is 82 yards wide throughout between solid piers or jetties of masonry, the West jetty, prolonged by wooden pile-work, being about 150 yards longer than the East jetty. The depth at high water, springs, is 37^ feet, and at neaps 31 feet, the channel having been dredged to a depth of 8 feet below the level of the lowest tides, which is about 2 feet lower than ordinary springs. This depth is also maintained in that part of the Outer port where the railway quay is situated and where passengers by mail steamers embark and land. The bottom alongside the quays of the Outer port is a mixture of mud and shingle, except where dredged ; it is about 3 feet at the North quay, and 4 or 5 feet at the South quay above the level of low water, ordinary springs. Vessels here are exposed to considerable surf when the sea is high at the entrance, which however decreases as the water rises in the entrance channel. The Inner port has a depth of only 4 feet less than the entrance channel and affords good soft grounding berths alongside its quays everywhere. Basins, &C. \u2014 The Duquesne basin is entered from the Outer port, it has an area of nearly 10 acres, is 54 feet wide at the entrance, and has 24 feet over the sill at high water, springs, and 17 feet at neaps. The Berigny basin opens into the Duquesne, has an area of nearly 9 acres, is 46 feet wide at the entrance, and has 23 feet over the sill at high water, springs, and 16 feet at neaps. The Half-tide and Floating basins, both constructed in the bed of the old Bassin de Chasses, are entered from the Inner port. The Half-tide basin is 492 feet long and 328 feet wide ; the entrance gates are 59 feet wide, and have 33 feet over the sill of the N.W. gates at high water, springs, and 26 feet 4 inches at neaps ; the sill of the S.E. gates have 3-1. feet less. The Floating basin or Bassin de la Retenue has a large area, being no less than 1,300 feet long by 289 feet wide, but has no quays on its eastern side. The dimensions of the entrance are the same as of the Duquesne. The depth of the basins is that of the adjoining lock gates, except the Half-tide basin, in which there are 1 foot 6 inches at the lowest tides. The harbour and basins therefore admit vessels of any length and of about 23 feet draught at high water, springs, and of about 17 feet at neaps. See plan, No. 1,078."], [555, "Chap.

The Duquesne basin is opened every tide, day and night, for all vessels, but the Berigny basin is only opened at night for steamers. Admittance to the others is generally available at springs, from 2 hours before until 2 hours after high water. Dry dock. \u2014 A new dry or graving dock was completed in 1896 ; it is on the northern side of the Inner port and was formed in the bed of the old flushing channel. It is 492 feet in length over all and 58 feet 6 inches wide in the entrance. Coals can always be obtained in any quantity and at low price. Vessels are coaled either alongside the wharves in the tidal harbour or afloat in the basins Pilots. \u2014 Sixteen pilots and six assistants, under the orders of a chief pilot, are stationed at Dieppe, they cruise in the offing in decked cutter-rigged boats. When the state of the sea is such as to prevent them boarding vessels in the offing, they remain on the jetty-heads and direct them by waving their hats. Steam-tUgS. \u2014 The services of steam-tugs are always available. LIGHTS. \u2014 The following lights are established on the jetties at Dieppe : \u2014 West jetty. \u2014 A fixed white light, with a red sector, dioptric and of the fifth order, is shown at 43 feet above high water from a stone tower 30 feet high and 38 yards from the old jetty-head, visible 10 miles.

Vessels should pass at least 15 yards clear of the green light. Fog bell. \u2014 A fog bell is sounded from the house on the Wes jetty continuously for 2 minutes, at one-minute intervals ; one stroke sounded in the intervals indicates a depth of 13 feet in the entrance channel, 2 strokes, 16-J feet, and so on.

The lower light is shown all night. The middle light is shown from 2\\ hours before until 2 hours after high water. The upper light is shown from 2 hours before until high water. The two latter are not lighted when from the state of the sea the harbour is inaccessible. As a guide to vessels entering, when from the state of the weather pilots cannot get on board, the mast which carries the lights is kept in a vertical position so long as the vessel preserves her proper course ; but, should she deviate, the mast is inclined to that side towards which she should steer. Vessels desirous of profiting by these signals should show two lights, one forward and one aft. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual tide signals, commencing from a depth of 6^ feet, are made from a flagstaff on the West jetty, and repeated approximately from the Semaphore station ; see page 12. A white flag with blue border, hoisted at the entrance of the harbour indicates that the basins are open. Special Signals for Steamers. \u2014 When one or more steamers are about to enter or quit the port, signals are hoisted either by day or night on a small mast about 20 yards within the house of the keeper, on the West jetty ; these signals are repeated on the summit of la Femme-Grosse point, near the Semaphore, and also at the mast near the entrance of the Half-tide basin. Whilst these signals are displayed, access to the entrance channel is forbidden to all other vessels ; those already within it, however, are to continue their movements. A white flag with a blue border hoisted above a red flag indicates that a steam- vessel may enter but not leave the port. The same flags reversed, that a steam-vessel may leave but not enter. At night, red and white lights are substituted for the flags. Semaphore. \u2014There is a Semaphore station on the cliff of la Femme-Grosse, 530 yards from the entrance to Dieppe and S.E. by E.

At spring tides, high water slack lasts 10 minutes ; at neaps, 30 or 40 minutes. Fresh westerly winds cause the tide to rise a foot or 18 inches higher than in calm weather, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. The highest tide takes place about 52 hours after full and change, and the least tide occurs about 63 hours after the quadrature. The mean duration of the rising tide on the beach at Dieppe is 5h. 40m., and of the falling tide 6h. 45m. A life-boat is stationed at Dieppe, and there is a mortar apparatus and other appliances on each pier. Directions. \u2014 Vessels of deep draught arriving off Dieppe during neaps are entitled to a pilot to take charge of them at sea, until there is sufficient depth to enter. When standing for the land with westerly winds towards the hour of low water, a position to wind ward should be maintained by making short tacks between point d'Ailly and St. Nicholas' chapel until there is water to run for the entrance ; with easterly winds, a vessel should keep on the meridian of the chapel. With off-shore winds in fine weather she may anchor for a few hours in 3^ fathoms, about 5 cables from the shore, North or N.N.W. of St. Nicholas' chapel. This anchorage is called Dieppe road, but with any appearance of northerly winds it should be left with all speed, and a good offing gained. In standing for the harbour, until half an hour after high water, the West jetty-head should be steered for, whatever the direction of the wind, because, at half a cable outside the jetty-heads, the eastern stream continues to be felt 40 minutes after high water, and it runs at the rate of 1^ knots. With a light wind, if this precaution is not taken, the vessel will be drifted eastward of the entrance. The West jetty-head should be approached with caution, and, if no pilot is on board, sufficient sail should be carried to execute quickly any change of course the pilots on the jetty may direct. Moderate winds from N.N.W. round by North to E.N.E. are the most favourable for entering Dieppe ; with all other winds it is necessary for a vessel either to secure the services of a steam-tug, or to steer for the weather jetty to be tracked in. The valley of Dieppe has a great influence on the direction of off-shore winds ; thus, if the Ste plan, >\"o. 1,078."], [558, "530 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. XL wind is E.S.E. in the offing it will be S.S.E. at the entrance of the harbour ; and, if West outside, it will be S.W. in the harbour and entrance channel. W.S.W. winds are reflected by the high cliff between Le Pollet suburb and Femme-Grosse point, and their force much weakened ; a vessel, therefore, running for the harbour with the wind between W.S.W. and W.N.W. should carry good sail to cross the broken water caused by these winds at the entrance. Telegraph cable. \u2014 A telegraph cable connecting with Beachy head leaves the shore a short distance eastward of Dieppe. The COAST from Dieppe trends E. by N. \\ N. 13-i- miles to Treport, and, like that westward of Dieppe, consists of high per pendicular cliffs of chalk and flint, intersected by numerous valleys. The land adjacent to the cliffs is slightly undulating, the highest parts being in the vicinity of Penly village and on the western point of the entrance of Criel valley, where the cliff is surmounted by Mont Joli-Bois, a remarkable conical mound covered with heath, of which the base is half a mile wide. The valleys, which may be recognised from the offing, are those of Puits, Belleville, Berneval, Penly, Neuvillette, Criel, and Mesnil. Puits valley descends to the shore a mite eastward of Dieppe, and at the top of its eastern steep edge are the remains of the Camp de Cesar, an ancient Roman encampment. The valleys of Berneval and Penly, the third and fourth eastward of Dieppe, are separated by 700 yards of perpendicular high land, and communicate with the beach by ravines hollowed out by floods caused by heavy rains. Criel valley, at the foot of Mont Joli-Bois, is half a mile wide at its entrance and is watered by the little river Yeres, which forces a passage for itself through the beach. When off the entrance of the valley, with it bearing S. by W. or S.S.W., the little town and spire of Criel will be seen up the valley about a mile from the shore. The valley of Mesnil is 2 miles westward of Treport, and is the last valley before reaching that place : it descends almost to the level of the beach. The whole of this coast is bordered by a rocky ledge which dries at low water, and a large quantity of shingle is heaped up at the foot of the cliffs. Throughout the greater part of its extent the ledge is not more than 2 cables wide, but in three places it projects farther and is dangerous to small vessels hugging the coast with off-shore winds.

Roches du Heaume. \u2014 The western projection of this ledge extends 5 cables from the shore in front of Berneval and Penly valleys ; the rocks are uneven, and the Roches du Heaume, the highest heads, uncover from 2 to 4 feet near its outer edge. Roches du Muron. \u2014 The second projeetion of the ledge fronts the valley of Mesnil ; it extends 4 cables from the shore, and on it are the Roches du Muron, a rocky group which uncovers 18 feet and bears N.W. 3 cables from the guard-house at Mesnil. The Haumes and Granges Rocks, the easternmost projection of the ledge, lie from 4 to 8 cables westward of the entrance to Treport and 3\u00a3 cables from the cliffs ; they consist of small ridges of rock rising above the sands. The Haumes, the western ridge, has several heads, of which the highest uncovers 8 feet. The Granges, the eastern ridge, is nearly 4 cables from the West jetty of Treport, and its highest part at the south-eastern point of the ridge uncovers 6 feet ; its northern part, W. by N. | N. 3 cables from the jetty-head, uncovers only a foot. Between the Granges and the Haumes there is an isolated rock which uncovers 14f feet. Between the meridians of Dieppe and Treport, the bottom is uneven and the depths irregular as far as 4 or 5 miles from the shore. The principal inequalities met with are the heaps of sand and broken shells named the Ridens de Belleville, de Neuvillette, de Treport, and the Bane Franc-Marque. Ridens de Belleville, about 3 miles from the shore in a N.N.W. direction from Berneval valley, are narrow ridges running parallel with each other in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, the least water on them being about 25 feet. The tidal streams occasion strong eddies amongst these ridges, and vessels subject themselves to a heavy sea by crossing them in bad weather during a weather tide ; see also remarks on Ridens, pages 509 and 524. Ridens de Neuvillette are small narrow sand-banks, on which there are from 3| to 5 fathoms. They commence about 6 cables from the shore abreast of Neuvillette valley and extend nearly 2 miles into the offing. The eddies on them are in general less dangerous than those on the Ridens de Belleville. Ste chart No. 2,147."], [560, "[Chap. XL 532 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. Ridens de Treport are four narrow ridges running parallel with each other in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, at from 2\\ to 3^ miles from the shore, and 1\\ miles in extent from East to West. The western ridge, N.W. 3| miles from the entrance of Treport, has only 21 feet water -, the others have from 19 to 25 feet on their highest parts. Bane Franc-Marque, from its south-western extreme North If miles from the entrance of Treport, is 1^ miles long N.E. \\ E. and S.W. \\ W., and 7 cables wide, with depths of from 2\\ to 3 fathoms. It appears to be the outer part of the bank, equally shoal, which extends from the shore, and, trending W.S.W., is only separated from it by a channel not more 1 han 2 or 3 feet deeper than the shoal. Anchorage. \u2014 The holding-ground is in general good along the coast between Dieppe and Treport, and vessels may anchor with off shore winds during an adverse tide, but in: such a position that they can gain an offing should the wind change and blow on the land. From Mont Joli-Bois to Treport there are many patches where the bottom consists of a black substance which appears to be peat, and here the anchors penetrate so deeply that they are difficult to weigh. There is anchorage to await tide, with off-shore winds and fine weather, 2 miles westward of Treport and 1\\ miles from the shore abreast of Mesnil valley, in 7 fathoms, sand and broken shells. The mariners of Treport call this the Petite rade ; the Grande rade is half a mile farther out and has excellent holding-ground with muddy bottom. At either anchorage a vessel should weigh and quit the coast at the first appearance of bad weather. A bottom, on which the soundings are less than 5 fathoms, extends a mile from the shore in front of Criel valley, and again at Treport, from whence its outer edge runs parallel with the shore as far as the meridian of Mers and then turns back westward round the Bane Franc-Marque, leaving a small deep with excellent holding-ground in 4^ fathoms, between that bank and the shore. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the edge of the cliff nearly half a mile westward of Treport ; see page ] 2.

XL] ANCHORAGE. \u2014 TREPORT. \u2014DEPTHS. 533 of the cliffs between cape d'Antifer and the river Somme. The entrance to the valley is half a mile wide, between abrupt hills rising 295 feet above the sea, and at the foot of the cliff in the southern part of the valley stands the town of Treport, its houses overlooked by a terrace and a large church built half way up the hill. The village of Mers stand on the slope of the hills on the northern side of the valley ; and, 2 miles south-eastward of the entrance, on a plain surrounded by hills covered with wood, is the Chateau d'Eu and the town of that name. The railway station is on the northern side of the port close to the sea ; by it, Treport is connected with the northern net- work of railways by lines running East, West, and South. The principal imports are coal and timber ; the exports, the products from the Bresle valley and goods from mid-France, and even from Switzerland ; this trade is maintained chiefly by a service of small steamers going or returning twice a week between here and London, and about once a week between here and Swansea. Exclusive of a large fishing trade, about 250 vessels of 45,000 tons enter the port annually, one third being steamers ; it offers a useful refuge also to small craft driven in-shore by stress of weather. It consists of a Tidal harbour, an Inner port, a Basin or wet dock, and an immense reservoir of scouring water immediately behind the tidal harbour with a surface of 200,000 square yards, communicating with the river Bresle by means of the Penthievre canal. Depths. \u2014 The flat fronting the harbour extends 300 yards beyond the piers and uncovers 3 feet ; the bottom of the entrance channel is from 3 to 6\u00a3 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; consequently, the least depth in the entrance at high water, springs, is about 2.H feet, and at neaps 19 feet. The tidal harbours and Basin have less water, but, at springs, vessels of 18 feet draught can enter the port and Basin ; and at neaps, those of from 10 to 12 feet draught. The entrance Channel is between two jetties of masonry a portion of which being supported on arches, allows part of the swell to pass through instead of the jetty receiving the whole force of it. The East jetty is 300 yards long, the West jetty about 20 yards less, though it projects considerably beyond the East jetty ; they are not quite parallel with each other, and, therefore, whilst the width of the channel is 60 yards at the entrance it is 85 yards wide at their inner end. The entrance was formerly obstructed by a bank Set pl\u00bbn, N\u00bb. 2,610."], [562, "[Chap. XL 534 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPB GRISNEZ. fronting the West pier, and by a bar across the channel ; these have, however, been removed. The Tidal harbour is 280 yards long, 220 yards wide, and has about 550 yards of quayage. The freestone bottom is visible almost throughout its whole extent, but at the foot of the quays it is covered with mud and shingle sufficiently soft to ground on, the berths being about 10^ feet above the zero of soundings, and having over them from 21^ feet at springs, to 15 feet at neaps. The best berths are in the northern angle of the harbour close to the railway, where the little London steamers lie and unload. In all other parts, with on-shore winds, there is much surf, and vessels strike heavily before they ground. The Inner port is entered at the north-eastern corner of the Tidal harbour, and is the connecting link between that harbour and the Basin, and is also tidal. It and the Basin were formed in the bed of the river Bresle, and it communicates by double gates with the Basin at its eastern end. The Basin, for a length of 333 yards, is 100 yards wide ; here vessels can make fast alongside the quays in 13 feet water. This depth is now being increased by dredging, the intention being that there shall be a least depth in the Basin of 19^ feet at high water, springs, and of 11^ feet at neaps. The Basin is entered from the Inner port by a lock 115 feet long, 26 feet wide, and with 19 feet over the sill at high water, springs, and 10^ feet at neaps. The south eastern end of the Basin opens into the canal d'Eu with gates of similar dimensions. The Canal d'Eu is 1^ miles in length and has from 12 to 13 feet water ; it terminates in a small Basin in the north-western part of the town of Eu. The surplus water of the Bresle, i.e., all which does not pass through the Penthievre canal into the reservoir, flows into the Basin at Treport and thence into the sea through a small sluice near the lock entrance. Pilots. \u2014 Two pilots and two assistant pilots are stationed at Treport, they also conduct vessels by the canal to Eu. Their services can always be obtained in moderate weather, and no stranger should attempt this harbour without a pilot.

East jetty. \u2014 A fixed red light, visible 5 miles, is shown from an iron pole at 23 feet above the sea and 21 feet from the outer end of the East jetty. Fog Signal. \u2014 In foggy weather, a bell is sounded from the West jetty. It gives 14 strokes every 12 seconds ; a double stroke in the intervals signifies that there are at least 6^ feet water in the channel ; see fog signals, page 11.

Slack water lasts 10 or 15 minutes at springs, but with north-easterly winds its duration is half an hour. Tidal Signals. \u2014 The usual tide signals are made from a mast on the West jetty whilst there are 6^ feet and upwards in the shallowest part of the bar and entrance ; see page 12. A red flag at the same mast indicates that the entrance is im practicable. A white flag with blue border hoisted at the mast at the lock entrance indicates that the basin is open. A blue flag at the mast on the East pier and at the sluice gates of the Bassin de Chasses indicates that they are or are about to be opened. The East jetty signal-staff works on a pivot and has two black arms. When the pilots are unable to board vessels in the offing, they incline it to the right or left, according as the vessel should keep to starboard or to port. When the movable part is kept horizontal, the entrance is inaccessible. Directions. \u2014 If a vessel's draught admits of her entering Treport, she has nothing to fear in ordinary weather from the banks and Ridens in its vicinity, but for the reasons already given they should be avoided when there is much wind. Sailing vessels running for the harbour from the westward or northward, with westerly winds, much before See plan, No. 2,610. 2 L SO 11886"], [564, "536 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. \" [Chap XL high water, should make the land about Criel valley, under Mont Joli-Bois, so that a position may be retained to windward of the harbour until there is sufficient depth to enter. At night, the lights of Ailly, Ault, and Cayeux are excellent guides for Treport. With a strong S.W. wind, to avoid passing too close to the Haumes and Granges rocks, on which the sea breaks even at high water, the East pier-head should be brought a little open of the West pier-head before hauling in for the latter. Vessels of the deepest draught the port admits should enter between half an hour before and half an hour after high water, springs ; and, as the flood or north-eastern stream runs across the entrance at the rate of from 1^ to 2 knots at 3 or 4 cables outside the jetties, and continues to be felt with less velocity- until 1^ hours after high water, sailing vessels must avoid being drifted to leeward of the entrance, which, however, is rarely missed in moderate weather. In running for the harbour with a strong wind from the offing, and a high sea, when pilots cannot go out to meet vessels, the anchors should be clear for letting go, hawsers coiled on deck, an anchor ready to moor by the stern, and sufficient sail carried to perform any necessary man\u0153uvre. These arrangements being completed, and no signal being made that the bar is not practicable, steer to pass close to the West jetty -head and watch for indications of alterations in the course being made at the flagstaff on the East jetty, or, as it is approached, by the pilots on the West jetty, who indicate by signs the courses to be steered in entering the channel. With a strong westerly- wind, should a vessel be driven to leeward of the entrance and be unable to regain an offing, she should anchor and wait until the ebb stream commences, if the state of the weather permits, and then weigh and gain an offing ; but, if the sea is too high near the shore, where indeed the holding-ground is not good, she should anchor in the small deep under the lee of the Bane Franc-Marque, see page 532, where she will be in some degree sheltered, and with two anchors down and a long scope of cable out she might ride out the flood and gain an offing on the ebb. If the wind is too far northward to reach this deep or to claw off the coast, the only resource is to run stem on the shingle beach with all sail set, as near as possible to the East jetty ; the shingle yields readily under a vessel, and if she takes the ground near the top of high water the crew will be saved. See plan, No. 2,610."], [565, "Chap. XL] TREPORT. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 COAST. 537 With off-shore winds, the harbour should be entered before high water. With a moderate wind and smooth sea, a vessel may easily get close in to the West jetty-head, and a crew is always at hand on one or the other jetty, according to the direction of the wind, to track in. With strong off-shore winds, violent squalls come down from the cliffs and out of the valleys, and it often happens that when standing for the jetty on the starboard tack, a vessel is taken aback in the midst of the rollers on the bar. When leaving the harbour, bound northward, in order to avoid the banks which uncover at the mouth of the Somme river and which extend as far out as the bearing N.E. f N. from the entrance to Treport, do not go eastward of the line of the eastern extreme of the wood surrounding Grange farm, above Treport, a quarter of a point open westward of the summit of the cliff at Mers point bearing about S.W. by S. ; bearing in mind that the flood stream runs east ward for at least 1^ hours after high water in the harbour and for still longer in proportion as the distance from the shore is increased. THE COAST.\u2014 The white cliffs bordering the coast from cape de la Heve terminate at the eastern part of the town of Ault, which lies E. by N. | N. about 4 miles from Treport and occupies the entrance and the north-eastern slope of a deep narrow valley at the head of the bight between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez. Nine valleys break the uniformity of the coast between Treport and Ault, and the shore is bordered by a rocky shelf, which in some places uncovers 2Jj cables from the cliffs at low water, the sea leaving a narrow space of hard sand in front of the shelf. The hills trend away from the shore in an E. by N. direction from Ault to the left bank of the river Somme and the coast-line becomes low, the hills joining by easy slopes the alluvial plain which lies between them and the sea. This level plain, consisting of meadows and cultivated land, is defended from the sea by a natural high shingle beach, 2 cables wide, sloping down to hard sands which uncover 5 cables out. The coast between Treport and Cayeux is inaccessible with on shore winds, and a heavy sea runs in on it during westerly gales. The beach between Ault and the first guard-house northward of it is exposed to all the violence of winds between W.S.W. and N.W., and the high sea occasioned by these winds drives the shingle See charts, Nos. 2,147 and 2,148.

After westerly gales, it frequently happens that little or no shingle remains on this part of the beach, and but for a small artificial dike constructed here, the sea would undoubtedly make an inroad on the plain. AULT LIGHT.\u2014 From a round white lighthouse, 76 feet high, on the hill north-eastward of the town of Ault, and at 331 feet above the level of high water, is exhibited a fixed and flashing white light with a four-minute period, visible 15 miles. The light also shows a red sector from S. 11\u00b0 W. to S. 56\u00b0 W., which covers the banks of the river Somme ; the colour of the fixed light only is affected in this sector. Cayeux. \u2014 The low coast which commences at Ault trends nearly in a straight line 5 miles north-eastward to the town of Cayeux, which is a mile in extent, stands on the shore in the midst of sand hills, and is in railway communication with St. Valery and thus with the general system of the country. The town is partly inhabited by fishermen, who, as the coast affords no shelter, haul their boats up above high-water mark in summer, and, in winter, place them in the little harbour of Hourdel within the mouth of the Somme. The only remarkable objects on this part of the coast are the houses of Cayeux, its church, particularly the bell tower, and five windmills in and around the town. In westerly gales, the sea heaps up a great quantity of sand in front of the northern part of the town, which is carried away by high winds into the interior. Within a mile southward of Cayeux church is a sheet of water named the Hable d'Ault, where the fresh water of the plain collects. Until the year 1767 this Hable (a corruption of the word havre or haven) communicated with the sea by a channel into which the fishing-boats of Ault and Cayeux, as well as small coasters, could run for shelter, but successive invasions of shingle filled up the entrance. Vessels of deep draught should not approach the coast between Mont Joli-Bois and Cayeux, nor should small vessels unless bound to Treport or the river Somme. The depth is only 4^ or 5 fathoms at 3 miles from the shore between Treport and Cayeux ; outside this, the soundings generally increase slowly to 8 and 9 fathoms at 6 or 7 miles in the offing, but, as before explained, vessels must be on See chart.

It is bounded on the South by the plain of which Cayeux occupies the north-western angle, and, on the North and North-east, by the low lands of Marquenterre and the Favieres marshes. The little harbours of Hourdel, St. Valery-sur-Somme, and Crotoy, are within the estuary ; the two first on the southern, the last on the northern bank. Vessels of from 15 to 18 feet draught can get up to Hourdel harbour at springs, and of 8 feet draught at neaps. The Crotoy channel, when not obstructed by sand-banks, as it sometimes is, admits vessels of 12 or 13 feet draught at ordinary springs. The channel leading up to St. Valery has been so improved that vessels drawing from 13 to 15 feet can get up to that town, which is the outport to Abbeville, with which it communicates by a canal 7^ miles long. Left bank Of the Somme. \u2014 From Cayeux, the left bank of the river takes a north-easterly direction for 3^ miles to Hourdel point, and is skirted by an immense quantity of shingle of an average breadth of 3 cables, which, as far as 2 miles from Cayeux, is covered by sand-hills of moderate height ; but, from Cayeux lighthouse to the low point of Hourdel, the shingle is uncovered and lies in a series of undulations, parallel with each other and with the shore. Between Hourdel point and St. Valery-sur-Somme, the shore is low, and at high water, springs, forms a bay 2-\\ miles long and half a mile deep, the land being defended from the incursion of the sea by an embankment, in front of which is a wide beach, parts of which hardly cover even at springs.

The harbour of St. Valery is at the eastern part of the town, and the navigation of the Somme ends here ; for, since the waters of this river and of the streams flowing into it above Abbeville have been diverted into and run out by the canal, the old bed of the river has nearly silted up.

The coast for 4 miles eastward of Crotoy is low, and an embank ment follows all its sinuosities, protecting the adjacent land from the sea. The southern part of St. Quentin point, as seen from Crotoy, is about 4 miles N.N.W. \\ W{ from that town, and, in the intervening space, the coast, consisting of low sand dunes, recedes a mile and forms a bay, at the head of which the little river Mate, which receives a large portion of the waters of the Marquenterre, loses itself running through the beach. The only objects that attract attention on this low coast are the windmill at St. Pierre, three quarters of a mile northward of Crotoy, and St. Firmin church tower, N. by E. \\ E. 3 miles from Crotoy. St. Quentin point is rounded and isa slight projection 1\\ miles northward of the point visible from Crotoy, from which latter the coast undergoes a sudden change in direction. The only object which serves to mark St. Quentin point from seaward, is a guard house built among the sand-hills on the point. These sand-hills are higher than those on the coast to the S.S.E., and may be seen in clear weather 8 or 10 miles distant. Banks in the estuary of the Somme. \u2014 The whole space included between the shores of the estuary just described, is nearly filled with a mass of sand which uncovers and extends 1\\ miles seaward of a line drawn from Cayeux to St. Quentin point. The surface of this sand is subject to great changes from the effect of wind and tide, it being every day furrowed afresh by the tidal streams and heaped into banks of which the shape and height are extremely variable. From the parallel of Cayeux to that of St. Quentin point, the banks as a whole slope gradually seaward but are steep towards the land ; their high parts extend from N.W. of Cayeux lighthouse to North of Hourdel point and are not covered at the lowest neaps ; the highest part of all in the northern part of the bay, called 1'Ilet by the fishermen, is 29 feet above the zero of soundings, and only covers at high spring tides. See chart, No. 2,148."], [570, "[Chap. XL 542 ESTUARY OF THE SOMME. Entrance Channels. \u2014 None but fishing-boats or small coasters, piloted by local seamen, can enter the Somme by the narrow winding channel under St. Quentin point. The two principal entrances are through the southern part of the banks ; the entrance to the South pass being abreast of Cayeux, and that of the North-west pass, north-westward of the lighthouse. These passes are subject to such incessant changes from the shifting of the sands, that a detailed description of them is impossible. They always, however, show a disposition to regain very nearly the positions assigned them on the Admiralty Chart. They are separated from each other by a bank, which uncovers from 11 to 21 feet at the lowest tides. The two channels meet and form one channel, sometimes above and sometimes below Hourdel, but again separate ; one portion taking the direction of Crotoy, the other of St. Valery. Though their outer parts are nearly dry at low water, they do not dry throughout, but, as far eastward as the meridian of St. Quentin point, have a succession of depressions, some with as much as 18 feet water, these depressions being separated from each other by shallow bars. Eastward of the meridian named, the bottoms of the channels are everywhere above the level of low water, but they do not dry entirely, though in no part is there sufficient water for even the smallest coasters to lie afloat. When, as is usual, the two narrow channels just described unite and form one channel between Cayeux lighthouse and Hourdel point, it is from thence called the Somme channel, is generally about 2 cables wide, and follows the direction of the shore ; but when the junction takes place eastward of Hourdel point, as it did in 1878, the South Pass is the only one by which Hourdel can be directly reached. Buoys. \u2014 The following buoys mark the approaches to the Somme. A red and black automatic whistle-buoy is moored in about 5 fathoms, with Cayeux S.W. light bearing S. 60\u00b0 E. 33 miles. Two red bell-buoys with cylindrical top-marks lie at the edge of the sands in from 13 to 16 feet water ; they are about 3\u00a3 miles apart, and nearly on the line given at page 537 for clearing the sands, viz., the eastern extreme of Grange wood a quarter of a point open of the summit of Mers point cliff.

XL] ENTRANCE CHANNELS. \u2014 BUOYAGE.\u2014 TIDES. 543 southern buoy is northward of the South pass, 1^ miles N.W. by W. from Cayeux S.W. light station. Two large buoys mark the entrance on either side to each Pass, and, from thence inwards, red and black buoys according to the French system (see page 14) mark the channels. Above Hourdel, the channels for Crotoy and St. Valery, respectively, are marked on the starboard hand by wooden perches, surmounted by crosses, and on the port hand by similar perches surmounted by skeleton balls. The buoys and perches are liable to be shifted as the channels change, but the- greatest care is taken to keep them in proper positions. Tides. \u2014 The tides at the entrance of the Somme are the highest met with anywhere between Cherbourg and Dunkerque, equi noctial springs rising 35 feet above the level of the zero of soundings ; and in each direction from the Somme their height diminishes. It is high water, full and change, at Cayeux, at llh. 5m. ; ordinary springs rise 29^ feet, neaps 23 feet above the zero of soundings. At Hourdel, where the bottom is 11 feet above the zero, ordinary springs rise from 20 to 21 feet, and neaps about 10 feet. At St. Valery, it is high water, full and change, at llh. 46m., and the tide rises at springs 32 feet above the zero of soundings, and at neaps about 25i feet ; the bottom of the harbour is from 14 to 16 feet above the zero. At Crotoy, the tide rises about 15 feet in the harbour at springs, and only 4 feet at neaps, with about a foot more in the entrance. In all these harbours, strong westerly winds raise the tides a foot or two and easterly winds have a contrary effect. Tidal Streams. \u2014 At 3 hours flood, the stream in the Somme channel runs 6 or 7 knots, at springs ; but when the channel widens the stream in some degree loses strength. The greater part of the banks of shifting sand, near Hourdel point, do not cover until 2\\ hours flood. From this cause, and until this time, the rapid stream through the Somme channel continues to run north-eastward between these banks and the eastern edge of the high bank barring the mouth of the Somme, and does not run eastward until joined by the stream which enters from the North-west, and by that flowing in along the edge of the beach on the northern shore of the estuary, by which time the banks are generally covered. The stream then follows the course of this northern beach until abreast of Crotoy, when the banks turn it south-eastward towards St. Valery. See chart, No. 2,148."], [572, "544 [Chap. XT. ESTUARY OF THE SOMME. When the banks around Hourdel point are covered, the flood finds a passage along the southern shore of the estuary and its speed slackens considerably. The channel formed by the tide along this shore is sinuous, uneven, extremely variable, and, as a rule, not so deep as that leading to Crotoy, from which it is separated by shifting sands. Pilots. \u2014 Pilotage is both necessary and compulsory for vessels over 10 tons. Pilots are stationed at Cayeux, Crotoy, and St. Valery, and in moderate weather they cruise at sea. Those of Cayeux do not take vessels beyond Hourdel unless no pilot for St. Valery or Crotoy presents himself. Those of Crotoy only are allowed to take vessels to any port in the Somme. TWO Steam-tUgS are stationed in the Somme, and when not engaged are usually on the look-out for vessels outside the entrance channels. Directions. \u2014 No sailing vessels off the mouth of the Somme should stand into less than 6^ fathoms, unless bound into the river ; in which case, with westerly winds, and before there is sufficient water to pass through either of the outer channels, they should maintain a position on the meridian of Mers cliff, and south-west ward of Cayeux church tower ; or, if the weather permits, they may anchor in about 7^ fathoms, good holding-ground, on the meridian of the cliff and W. by N. of Cayeux ; with off-shore winds, they may anchor a little westward of the large bell-buoys moored outside the banks, and no vessel should attempt to enter without a pilot. The tide signals, see page 539, make known when the narrows are practicable, and then, with a fair wind, a vessel may enter under sail ; or, with a foul wind, secure the aid of a steam-tug. In bad weather, pilots cannot always board vessels requiring them, and such vessels may be embayed and compelled to run in, which is always practicable towards high water, springs, when the signals and buoys marking the channels can be seen. To meet such an emergency, a flagstaff, with the upper part working on a pivot, stands half a mile north-eastward of Cayeux lighthouse ; on this, a flag is hoisted and is inclined to the right or left as may be necessary to direct a vessel in the channels ; if she has entered and is steering a proper course, the flagstaff is kept in a vertical position, if not, it is See chart, No. 2,148."], [573, "Chap. XL] 545 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 HOURDEL. \u2014 ST. VALERY. drooped on the side towards which she should steer. These signals are made to vessels of all sizes when they have signalled for a pilot. Vessels having entered, but finding themselves unable to reach either of the ports, should run aground under cover of one of the points or under the lee of a bank where they will be sheltered from the stream, for those grounding on the soft shifting sands in the strength of the stream are liable to be undermined by it and capsize. At night, pilots will not risk bringing vessels in, except it be moon light or very- clear and fine. HOURDEL. \u2014 When the Hable d'Ault, see page 538, was closed, the bight within Hourdel point served as a refuge for the Cayeux fishing-boats, but the constant increase of the sands threatening to fill it up, an artificiai tidal harbour, open to the eastward, was made to shelter coasting craft. It is from 270 to 325 yards long and 76 yards wide, and has a Reservoir for clearing the entrance by sluicing. (For depths, see page 540.) It will contain about 30 vessels well secured, but, except for the Cayeux fishery, its trade is entirely unimportant. As the direction of the entrance is athwart the tidal streams, which are very strong except just at high water, it is imprudent to attempt to enter without a pilot, who, if unable to board a vessel in the offing, can at all times do so after she has passed through the outer channels. Harbour light. \u2014 A fixed white light, of the fifth order, visible 6 miles, is shown from a wooden gibbet on Hourdel point. It is lighted 3 hours before high water and extinguished 3 hours after high water. Fog Signal. \u2014 A bell is sounded every three seconds in foggy weather ; it commences to sound one hour before the flood, and continues to sound until three hours after high water ; see fog signals, page 11.

On the West and South, it is bounded by the shore of La Ferte suburb, a part of which, 438 yards long, has been converted into a quay, and along the shore as far as the lighthouse there is a towing path which, with the intention of reclaiming the land to the southward, was continued as a low dike across the sands as far as Hourdel harbour, but has sunk beneath them. The population of St. Valery is about 4,000. It is the only commercial port of the Somme, and by means of the Somme canal is connected with Abbeville and with the general canal system of France, and, by the branch railway to Noyelles, with the general railway system. Trade. \u2014 Depths, &C. \u2014 About 250 vessels, of an aggregate of 50,000 tons, enter the port annually. The exports are chalk, vegetables, sand, and ballast ; the imports, wood, coal, pig iron, &c. The harbour is quite sheltered from wind and sea, and can berth from 30 to 35 vessels alongside the quays, where they ground on a bottom of chalky- mud mixed with sand and some shingle ; at ordinary springs there is sufficient water for vessels of 15 feet draught, and at neaps for those of 9 or 10 feet. A regular depth is maintained by daily flushings from the canal. The tide begins to flow into the harbour about three hours after the commencement of the flood on Cayeux beach, and it fills in about 2^ hours ; at 4 hours ebb it is quite dry ; see also \" Tides,\" page 543. Harbour lights. \u2014 A fixed green light, 25 feet high, and visible 4 miles, is exhibited from an iron pillar at the end of the towing path in front of St. Harold's tower, St. Valery. A fixed red light, 25 feet above high water, and visible 4 miles, is exhibited from an iron pillar at the mole-head on the port hand in entering the harbour. CANAL de la SOMME, on the left or southern bank of the river, is 7^ miles in length ; it commences at the village of Sur- Somme, 2 miles below Abbeville, and terminates at the head of St. Valery harbour in a lock 275 yards long and 55 yards wide. The two entrances of the lock are both 28 feet wide ; the outer sill is 16 feet above the zero of soundings, and therefore has 16 feet over it at high water, springs, and 9^ feet at neaps ; the inner sill rather less.

The mean depth of water maintained in the canal is 11 feet 6 inches ; it can, however, be raised to 18 feet. The maximum draught of vessels admitted into the canal is 11 feet, and at Abbeville there is not swinging room for vessels over 145 feet in length. The canal is crossed by four bridges with openings, of which the smallest is 29J feet wide. PORT d' ABBEVILLE, in the western part of the town' of Abbeville, extends 600 yards along the right bank of the Somme, from the ramparts to the bridge which unites the Hocquet and the Marcadet quarters of the town. A quay extends the whole length of the port, and the railway is alongside the quay ; the river is sufficiently deep along the quay to admit of vessels drawing 11 feet remaining afloat. About 60 small vessels arrive at Abbeville by the canal yearly, their total tonnage being about 6,000 tons. The town contains about 18,000 inhabitants, and though walled and formerly a place of some strength, is no longer classed as a fortress. Being on the railway line between Amiens and Boulogne it is in direct com munication with Paris. CROTOY. \u2014 The port consists of a natural creek sheltered from the sea by the little promontory on which the town of Crotoy stands. The harbour works comprise wooden pile work on the side of the town forming the quay, and, on the other side, a reservoir or Bassin de Chasses for flushing and keeping open the channel ; at the head of the harbour, the Canal de Mate conducts the waters from the pond at Rue and the Favieres marshes into the Somme, and contributes to keep the entrance open. Crotoy occupies an advantageous position as relates to the circuitous course the flood stream takes in the mouth of the Somme during the time it has most strength ; it is equally accessible with the prevailing winds by either Pass, and the channel up to the entrance of Crotoy is almost always 3 feet deeper than either to Hourdel or St. Valery ; nevertheless, the construction of the Canal de la Somme, on the opposite shore, has entirely destroyed its trade, which, beyond the few fishing-boats belonging to the harbour, is now represented by about a dozen vessels calling annually.

BANCS de la SOMME.\u2014 The off-lying banks, generally called the Somme banks, are the Bassurelle de la Somme, the Quemer, the Battur, and the south-western part of the Bassure de Baas. Those dangerous banks lying in Dover strait, the Varne, Ridge or Colbart, Bassurelle, Ridens, and Vergoyer, are fully described in Channel Pilot, Part I. There is always sufficient water on the Somme banks to admit of vessels crossing them when bound for the mouth of the Somme. From the south-western end of the Bassure de Baas the land can be seen only in fine weather ; the eddies on the banks occasion a heavy sea when it blows hard, but the soundings on them differ sufficiently from those in the channels between to enable the mariner to know his position with reference to the banks and the land. The Quemer and the Bassurelle de la Somme appear to be extensions of that immense mass of sand and broken shells which forms the sub marine slope along the shore from St. Valery -en-Caux to the mouth of the river Canche. The Bassurelle de la Somme and the Quemer spread south-westward across the mouth of the Somme ; the Quemer ends about 10^ miles N.W. by W. W., and the Bassurelle de la Somme 10 miles W. by N. \\ N. from Cayeux lighthouse. Neither of these banks are dangerous, but they are joined to the shore by a shoal bottom on which the depth is less than 5 fathoms, and which extends nearly 5 miles into the offing. This shoal bottom terminates in two points projecting in the direction of the banks, the firsi 7^ miles W. by S. from St. Quentin point, the other 1\\ miles W. by S. \\ S. from Routhiauville point ; the latter has only 17 feet water 5 miles from the point on that bearing. The Battur is in the channel separating the Quemer and Bassurelle de la Somme from the Bassure de Baas, and carries a depth of from 6 to 8 fathoms. It is not dangerous to vessels of any draught, but the eddies over it cause a heavy sea when it blows hard. It is 8^ mites long N.E. by E. \\ E. and S.W. by W. \\ W. within the 10-fathoms line ; from its south-western extreme, Cayeux See chart, No. 2,148."], [577, "Chap.

The Bassure de Baas is a narrow bank of sand and shells, about 35 miles long from its northern end, which is 3^ miles south westward of cape Grisnez and 1^ miles from the shore just south ward of Audrecelles ; it follows nearly the direction of the coast as far as the mouth of the river Canche and then curves gradually westward, terminating about 17 miles from the shore a little southward of the parallel of the mouth of the river Authie, and 18 miles N.W. from Cayeux lighthouse. From its northern end, as far as 5 miles southward of the Canche, it is dangerous to vessels of deep draught and, at low water, its highest parts may be touched by vessels of light draught when there is any sea on. The shoalest and most dangerous spot is a small fiat, 5 cables long N.N.E. and S.S.W., with only 12 feet on its southern part and 16 or 17 feet on its northern end, from which the column of the Grande Armee, sometimes known as Buonaparte's column, three quarters of a mile northward of Boulogne, bears N.E. by E. E. ; cape Alprech lighthouse E. by N. | N. 2 miles ; and, the summit of Mont St. Frieux S.S.E. \\ E. The sea breaks with great violence on the whole of this flat during strong westerly winds. For 14 miles southward of this flat, as far as W. \u00a3 S. 9 miles from Touquet point lighthouse, the shoalest parts of the Bassure de Baas form a succession of long narrow flats where the depths vary from 18 to 26 feet, and where the sea breaks heavily when it blows hard from the westward. There are no dangers in the channel between the bank and the shore, but, with a strong breeze and weather tide, a high sea runs on some shoal spots of from W>\\ to 8 fathoms lying nearly in the middle of that channel. During bad weather, with winds between West and N.N.W., the sea is less disturbed in this channel than outside the Bassure de Baas, especially from abreast of the mouth of the Canche northward to cape Alprech. Directions. \u2014 As the eastern side of the Bassure de Baas is steep to, the lead is an uncertain guide for avoiding the 12-feet patch on its northern part when running through the channel between the bank and the shore ; but, by steering S.W. \\ S. with Creche point Set chart, No. 2,148."], [578, "[Chap.

In thick weather, when the light-buoys marking the northern end of the Vergoyer may not be seen, great attention should be paid to the lead when approaching the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the Vergoyer from the northward, for the latter bank presents a steep projecting point approaching the French coast at the outer edge of the 20-fathoms line of soundings. A vessel running from the southward through this channel, which is 5 miles wide and carries a depth of from 14 to 23 fathoms, avoids the Vergoyer by keeping in from 15 to 16 fathoms throughout the whole length of the channel. THE COAST. \u2014 From St. Quentin point, the coast, which is low and bordered by ranges of sand-hills, trends N.N.E. 4\u00a3 miles to Routhiauville point, at the southern side of the mouth of the river Authie, and the only objects rising above the sand-hills and visible in clear weather are, the tall spire of St. Quentin church and the windmill at Royons. The intermediate shore is fronted by a strand which dries 1^ miles south-westward from St. Quentin point, and West 1\\ miles from Routhiauville point ; between these points it dries out from 5 to 6 cables. Caution. \u2014 Great caution is necessary to avoid being caught on this part of the coast by strong westerly winds, for they cause a high sea over the shoal bottom extending 5 miles from the shore and increase the speed of the flood, which in calm weather runs at the rate of 3 knots to the northward. The same winds also decrease the rate of the ebb, and no dependence can be placed on the strength of this stream to assist a vessel in clawing off the coast. The ESTUARY of the AUTHIE is comprised between point Routhiauville and Haut-Banc or Berck point, which bear N. by E. and S. by W. 2\\ miles from each other, and extends eastward 2\\ miles to its head, where it is about 3 cables wide with the river Authie flowing into it from the southward. The entrance is filled with an accumulation of sand and broken shells which dries at half tide, and, at low water, springs, uncovers 1^ miles westward of the meridian of Haut-Banc point.

A sand-bank, barely covered at high water, neaps, joins this point and extends in a circuit of more than a mile between the bearings N.N.W. and N.E. from the point. A similar bank surrounds Haut-Banc point and projects a mile between the bearings W.S.W. and S.S.E. from the point. The channel into the Authie is principally kept open by the flood stream which sets in with great rapidity until the banks are covered. The entrance is between the banks just described, and the channel varies in position by the shifting of the banks and is sometimes divided into two passes ; it runs in an easterly direction from the outer edge of the sands and terminates in a narrow trench along side a low rough stone dike, constructed in order to turn the ebb stream away from the northern bank and thus put a stop to the erosion of that bank and of Haut-Banc point. Fishermen haul their boats up here and the channel is marked by little red and black buoys, but the changes are so frequent that it is quite possible the channel may eventually fill up altogether. Depths. \u2014 The bottom of the grounding places and the higher parts of the channel are 15 or 16 feet above the zero of soundings. The water rises in the channel and at the grounding places about 5 feet at the lowest neaps, about 7^ feet at mean neaps, about 14 feet at ordinary springs, and 2 or 3 feet higher at equinoctial springs. The banks of the Authie have undergone great changes of late years, the tendency of the estuary being to move bodily northward. Between 1835 and 1878, Routhiauville point advanced about 550 yards northward and Haut Bane point receded about 450 yards in the same direction. The dike referred to is of modern construc tion and, with other works for the protection of the northern shore, seems, since 1882, to be fairly answering its purpose. > Haut-Banc Or Berck point may be easily recognised by day by its circular white lighthouse and guard house standing near it on the sand-hilis, which are sufficiently high to be seen in clear weather 7 or 8 miles distant ; and by the still more conspicuous hospital, a large building close to the shore, erected by the municipality of Paris for the treatment of invalid children.

The light is visible 17 miles, but is obscured when bearing S. \\ W. through an angle of 20', by the tower of the hospital. A life-boat is stationed near the lighthouse, and there is also a mortar apparatus and other life-saving appliances. Directions. \u2014 The mouth of the river Authie is dangerous to approach during the flood, especially with westerly winds, as the stream then runs in with great rapidity and might draw a vessel on the banks where she would almost certainly become a total wreck ; the buoys meant for the use of small fishing vessels of about 5 feet draught belonging to Groffliers are not sufficient guides for a stranger to enter the channel. No vessel, indeed, however light her draught, should attempt the entrance, unless in charge of one of the Berck or Groffliers fishermen, who alone are in a position to know the changes taking place in the channel. The COAST from Haut-Banc point trends N.N.E. 8 miles to Touquet point at the entrance of the river Canche. The shore is low, sandy, and bordered by a range of sand-hills of moderate height. A sandy strand 5 cables wide uncovers at the foot of the sand-hills, and joins the accumulation of sand which obstructs the entrances of the rivers Authie and Canche. The low plain adjoining the shore extends to the foot of the hills 3 or 4 miles inland and is divided in its whole length into two nearly equal parts by a chain of sand-hills, much higher than those near the beach, and which may- be seen 8 or 9 miles distant. This chain of sand-hills may be mistaken for those bordering the beach, although they are 1| or 2 miles inland, and it is important to guard against this mistake when turning to windward in-shore in hazy weather. The objects which serve as distinguishing marks on this part of the coast are, the windmills of Verton and St. Josse, on the hills in the interior ; the chain of sand-hills just described ; the lighthouses on Haut-Banc and Touquet points ; the hospital, windmills, and church tower at Berck-sur-mer, the latter standing on the plain E. by N. 1^ miles from Haut-Banc point is an excellent landmark ; and the Semaphore station south-westward of Touquet point lighthouse.

Merlimont, and Cuque, fit out about fifty fishing-boats of from 2 to 9 tons burden, which they generally beach at high water just northward of Haut-Banc point. The ESTUARY of the CANCHE, known locally as the bay of Etaples, is 2 miles wide between Touquet and Lornel points, the southern and northern limits of the entrance, and runs 3 miles inland in a S.S.E. direction. Like the estuaries of the Somme and the Authie, it is filled by a mass of sand and broken shells which is left dry at half ebb and uncovers at low water about one mile outside the general line of the coast. Like the Authie estuary, also, it inclines to move bodily northward and also to become narrower, Touquet point having extended northward 330 yards between 1835 and 1878, and Lornel point having receded about 200 yards in the same period ; and this northward movement still continues. The entrance points and shores of the river consist of sand-hills of moderate height, of which the shapes are frequently changed by westerly gales. ETAPLES. \u2014 From Touquet point, the southern shore of the estuary trends S.E. S. as far as abreast of the small port of Etaples, a place with about 3,000 inhabitants, which, in ancient times, was of considerable importance, but has now only its rather extensive fishery, the general trade having been entirely destroyed by the silting up of the bay, which now only admits vessels of about 9 feet draught, at springs, as far as Etaples ; the grounding berths, of muddy sand, are on the north-western side of the town where there is a wooden quay and mooring posts. The northern shore of the estuary is low and winding ; between Etaples, which stands on the northern bank of the river Canche, and Lornel point, its general trend is N.N.W. and the two shores converge towards each other, the river, abreast of the town, being very narrow. The surf and westerly winds heap up the sand round Touquet point, where it forms a bank barely covered at high water, neaps, and extending in a circuit of nearly a mite between the bearings N.N.W. and N.N.E. from the point. This bank shelters the inner part of the bay, and fishing craft unable to reach Etaples in one tide lie aground in the channel in safety under its lee. A similar bank lies in front of Lornel point and extends nearly a mile in a W.S.W. direction. Between these banks is the entrance channel to the river. See chart, No. 2,148.

XL Depths. \u2014 Between Touquet point and Camiers light, the bottom in the channel is 13 feet above the level of the lowest tides, and consequently, there are only 19 feet at high water, springs, and 13 feet at neaps. From the outer end of the dikes (presently described) to Etaples there are from 5 to 7 feet less. At Etaples quay there are 3J feet at high water of the lowest neaps ; 7 feet at mean neaps ; and 10\u00a3 feet at ordinary springs. The tide begins to rise at Etaples about 1\u00a3 hours before high water, and the harbour dries about 3 hours after high water. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the estuary of the Canche at llh. 20m. ; the rise is 32 feet at springs! and 26 feet at neaps, above the zero of soundings. The rising tide does not check the stream of the Canche until about half flood. Both streams are very rapid through the channel so long as the banks are uncovered, but their rate does not exceed 3 knots during the last hour of the flood and the first hour of the ebb. With westerly gales, the sea is high at the entrance, and the waves caused by a strong south-westerly wind cross it obliquely. The Entrance Channel runs between the banks, as described, in an easterly direction towards Camiers lighthouse on the northern shore of the river ; from thence, it is between two submersible dikes of rough chalk stones, before referred to, for nearly 2 miles up to and abreast of Etaples, where the western dike-end is connected with the southern shore. The channel is only about 70 yards wide abreast of the town quays, but between the dikes it is double that width. The western dike is marked by four red beacons with conical top-marks ; the eastern dike by five black beacons with cylindrical top-marks ; the outer beacon in each case marking the end of the dike. Half a mile above Etaples the viaduct of the Northern railway crosses the river. By means of this line the town is in direct com munication with Boulogne on the North, and also with Amiens and Paris. Pilots. \u2014 Two pilots and an assistant pilot are stationed at Etaples. When they are unable to get out to a vessel, they come as far as the weather permits and signal by hand the direction to be taken. The smillest vessel, without local knowledge, should not think of attempting this channel without a pilot. See chart. No. 2,148."], [583, "Chap. XL] ESTUARY OF THE CANCHE. \u2014 LIGHTS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. 555 Buoys. \u2014 The edge of the sands off the estuary of the Canche is marked by two large buoys, viz. : a black spindle buoy to the northward and a red bell-buoy to the southward, these buoys being about 1\\ miles apart. The channel between the banks up to the dike-ends is well marked by red and black buoys, the positions of which are frequently changed to suit the variations in the channel. LIGHTS.\u2014 Touquet point\u2014 Two octagonal lighthouses, 273 yards apart, bearing N. by E. i2 E. and S. by W. W. from each other, stand on Touquet point ; each exhibits, at 174 feet above high water, a fixed white electric light, visible 20 miles. This light is to be altered by the discontinuance of the northern light, and the substitution of a group-flashing light for the fixed light at the southern lighthouse. Camiers. \u2014 From a white square stone tower on the northern shore, and at 56 feet above high water, is exhibited a fixed red and white light, visible 9 miles through an angle of 90\u00b0, i.e., between points Lornel and Touquet. It shows red over the highest parts of the banks which separate the two existing channels into the Canche. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station about a mile south westward from Touquet point, and half that distance W. by S. \\ S. from the South lighthouse ; see page 12. Directions. \u2014 At night, the heavy sea an sand-banks at the mouth of the river Canche may be avoided by keeping cape Grisnez light well open westward of cape Alprech light. By day, the extreme of cape Grisnez should be kept about half a point open westward of cape Alprech. Though vessels should never attempt to enter the Canche without a pilot or some person of local experience, they may be driven to do so by bad weather, or by finding themselves embayed amongst the sand-banks. The pilots reside at Etaples, and as it is impossible for them to board vessels outside when it blows hard from the west ward, they then meet them under shelter of the bank extending from Touquet point. Vessels without pilots, seeking shelter, should endeavour as soon as possible to get sight of the outer red bell-buoy, and it is important not to pass northward of the parallel of Touquet point before the buoy See chart, No. 2,148."], [584, "[Chap. XL 556 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. is sighted, for, if set too far northward by the flood stream, which is running at its greatest strength outside the banks at the time of high water at Etaples, it is impossible to regain the entrance. The most favourable time for entering the Canche is about one hour before high water, for the stream then runs into the channel with sufficient strength to assist a vessel in threading her way , and the water still rises enough to float her should she take the ground. Pass between the black and red buoys, leaving the black to port and the red to starboard, as usual. At springs, pilots place vessels drawing 10 or 11 feet water, when not bound to or unable to reach Etaples, in the elbow above Touquet point ; here they lie in safely even during westerly gales, protected by the high bank which joins Touquet point, and which dries from 21 to 23 feet above the level of the lowest tides. Caution. \u2014 The very low land, coupled with the dangers bordering the shore, render the navigation between Cayeux and the mouth of the Canche extremely dangerous in foggy or snowy weather, or during westerly gales accompanied by rain, when the weather is generally dark, the land covered with mist, and the most brilliant lights difficult to distinguish. Moreover, with these gales, a few hours suffice to raise a heavy sea in the eastern part of the Channel, and especially on the edge of the great submarine slope which extends off-shore from St. Valery-en-Caux to the river Canche, and this alone causes a considerable drift ; but, in addition, westerly gales tend to drive the water towards the head of the bight formed between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez, and greatly influence the direction of the tidal streams, see page 571. It may be seen, there fore, how important it is that a vessel should not run into the eastern part of the channel without her position being well ascertained by bearings of cape Barfleur light, or of St. Catherine's light, Isle of Wight, and without using every precaution after these lights are lost sight of. The only safeguard is the frequent use of the lead ; and, if lights cannot be distinguished or the position is from any cause doubtful, vessels should keep in at least 20 fathoms water whatever be the time of tide ; this not only keeps a vessel clear of the dangers near the shore, but also of the off-lying banks between the mouth of the Somme and Dover channel.

The COAST from Lornel point trends N. by E. 8\u00a3 miles to cape Alprech, and from thence N.E. } E. 2 miles to Boulogne. The shore is low, bordered by sand-hills of moderate height, and runs in a straight line from the mouth of the Canche to that of the Brone rivulet, which finds its way into the sea 2 miles southward of cape Alprech, and is the northern limit of the low sandy shore forming the coast-line for the whole distance of 34 mites from the town of Ault, near Treport. A mile northward of the rivulet the coast is low with hills sloping down towards it, and, on their sides, several houses of the village of Equihen may be seen ; beyond this, the coast is steep, and consists of clay and of schistose rocks of a dark grey colour. The high land separating the courses of the rivers Canche and Liane, which latter runs into the sea at Boulogne, extends westward to within 1^ miles of the shore and terminates near the meridian of Etaples in a chain of hills, of which many are sufficiently high to be seen in clear weather 25 miles distant. These hills are excellent landmarks for the pilots, who call them the terres de Tourmont or Tourmont-land. At 1\\ miles inland, and in front of the Tourmont-land, is Mont St. Frieux, 505 feet in height, and one of the most remarkable objects between the river Canche and Boulogne. It consists of four mounds or hillocks, very- near each other, rising from the same base and occupying a space of about one mile. From its isolated position and height, Mont St. Frieux may be seen in clear weather 25 miles distant. On the highest of the hills northward of the Brone rivulet is the church of St. Etienne-au-Mont, Gravois mill, and also the two mills near Alprech, all of which may be seen a considerable distance at sea. The sandy beach, which borders the shore almost to cape Alprech, uncovers at low water 5 cables from the foot of the sand hills, but northward of the Brone rivulet the width of sand gradually decreases and the shore is bordered by a shelf of irregular rocks which dry a cable outside high-water mark. CAPE ALPRECH* is a perpendicular rocky cliff of a brownish red colour, 135 feet above the level of high water ; the foot of the cliff is skirted by a shelf ot rock covered with boulders which dries * See Admiralty chart : \u2014 Cape Alprech to Ambleteuse, including Boulogne, No. 438 ; scale, m = 4-9 inches."], [586, "[Chap. XL 558 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. a cable out at low water. From the cape, the coast turns sharply north-eastward, and is high and steep-to within 4 cables of the jetties of Boulogne. LIGHTS.\u2014 A square lighthouse, 33 feet high, stands on the summit of cape Alprech about 87 yards from the edge of the cliff, near the tower of the old semaphore, and 2J miles south- westward from the entrance to Boulogne. It exhibits, at 161 feet above high water, a flashing red light visible 17 miles ; the flash takes place at intervals of five seconds and lasts a quarter of a second, the eclipse four and three-quarter seconds. A. fixed white leading light is shown from a shed N. | E. 164 yards from Alprech lighthouse ; it is 144 feet above high water, and visible 9 miles. The two lights in line lead 2\u00a3 cables seaward of the elbow of the Carnot breakwater. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station on cape Alprech just southward of the lighthouse ; see page 12. PORTEL. \u2014 The coast between cape Alprech and Boulogne is intersected by valleys, and at the entrance of the largest is the village of Portel. This valley, 6 cables N.E. by E. of the cape, is enclosed by high land, and on the summit of the hill on its northern side stands the fortress of Mont Couple, in which is a Semaphore. The rocks, which uncover at low water, extend 4 cables off-shore from Portel, and, on their summit, N. \\ E. about 6 cables from cape Alprech lighthouse, is Heurt fort, from which the Lineur sunken rocks project N. by W. \\ W. 2\\ cables, and a heavy sea runs on them with a fresh south-westerly wind. The fishermen of Portel have about 40 boats ; during the fine season, they ground them on the south-western side of a small beach in front of the village where they are sheltered during the greater part of the tide by the surrounding rocks. When the weather is threatening they haul them up above high-water mark and place them in the bed of a rivulet which runs through the valley ; in winter they take shelter in Boulogne harbour. BOULOGNE. \u2014 This port, occupying the entrance of the valley of the Liane, has during the last ten years undergone great alterations and improvements, and although a very large portion of the projected See chart, No. 438."], [587, "Chap. XL] 559 PORTEL.\u2014 BOULOGNE. \u2014 BREAKWATER. plans have been definitely abandoned, enough has been done to render it one of the most convenient and best sheltered of the French channel ports. The principal objects recognised when approaching Boulogne are, Mont St. Frieux, already described, see page 557 ; Mont Lambert, fortified, 1\\ miles to the eastward, the highest land in the neighbour hood of Boulogne ; and the column of the Grande Armee on the high land a mile northward of the town. The entrance to the harbour bears N.W. by W. from the summit of Mont Lambert, and W. \\ S. from the column ; the former is 604 feet, and the head of the statue on the column 448 feet above the level of high water. OUTER HARBOUR.\u2014 With the object of enclosing a large water space outside the port affording shelter from the prevailing westerly winds, of which space a great portion should be available for ships of the deepest draught at all times of tide, the Carnot breakwater, of stone and of the most solid construction, has been completed. It starts from the shore under the Chatillon cliff, a mile south-westward of the harbour entrance, and runs out 1,410 yards in a N.N.W. \\ W. direction ; it then curves for about 220 yards until its direction becomes N.E. by N., when it runs a farther distance of about 715 yards ; the whole extent of this magnificent work being 2,345 yards. A lighthouse stands at its extreme end, and a stone beacon 1,230 yards from the inner end. Whistle-buoy. \u2014 A red automatic whistle-buoy is moored W.N.W. 1\u00a7 cables from the lighthouse on the breakwater end. Depths.\u2014 The Carnot breakwater shelters an area about 120 acres in extent, called the Outer or deep-sea harbour, of which, however, although the work is always in progress, only a portion has yet been dredged ; viz., a space about 4 cables long and 1^ cables wide, next the outer arm of the breakwater, affording anchorage in from 32 to 27 feet at the lowest tides. At 100 yards inshore of this space, there are as yet only from 3 to 6 feet water, and the shallow extends to the beach ; the dredging of an area of 150 acres to a least depth of 26 feet, and the greater part to a depth of 33 feet, has, however, received Government sanction. Alprech lighthouse in line with the stone beacon on the breakwater leads along the central line of the anchorage and up to the western most of two large mooring buoys 130 yards apart. The large mail See chart, No. 438."], [588, "560 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. XL steamers of the Nederland transatlantic line use this anchorage for the transhipment of cargo and passengers. In the southern corner of this Outer harbour, and at the inner end of the breakwater, is a small harbour, dry at low water, constructed for the use of vessels loading with stone in the building of the breakwater, and now but little used ; other large works for the prospective accommodation of shipping are in various stages of progress between it and the port of Boulogne. The PORT Of BOULOGNE is formed at the mouth of the Liane, a smnll river whose waters are abundant during rainy seasons or at the melting of the snow. It consists of an Entrance channel, Avant port, Tidal port, Inner port, and Bassin-a-flot or wet dock. The town has a population of about 46,000, of whom about one-fifth are English ; it is divided into Chatillon and Capecure ou the western side, and St. Pierre, Basse Ville, and Haute Ville on the eastern side of the harbour ; it is built in the form of an amphitheatre in and on the sides of a valley enclosed between high hills. The buildings most easily recognised from the sea are the bell-tower and cupola of the cathedral in Haute Ville, the church spire in Basse Ville, the marine baths, the windmill half way up the hill south-eastward of the baths, and the church of St. Pierre des Marins on the cliff. There is a small British Seamen's institute with recreation and reading rooms. Vice-consul. \u2014 A British Vice-consul is stationed at Boulogne. Entrance Channel.\u2014 The entrance to the port is perfectly sheltered against the prevailing westerly winds by the Carnot break water, which has also modified to so great an extent both the strength and direction of the tidal streams as to have rendered the harbour comparatively easy of access. The two piers enclosing the channel are of unequal length and run out across a sandy strand which extends beyond the pier-heads and uncovers 3\u00a3 cables from the shore at the lowest tides. The piers are 230 feet apart, and, from the entrance, which has a S.E. by S. direction, curve slightly eastward. The S.W. pier is 735 yards long and consists of stone-work up to the level of the highest tides, on which is wooden pile-work the whole length of the pier. The N.E. pier, 547 yards long, curves and lies parallel with the S.W. pier, and also consists of a stone f ounda- See chart, No. 438,"], [589, "Chap. XL] 561 BOULOGNE.\u2014 ENTRANCE. \u2014 BASINS. tion, rising to the level of the sands only, and surmounted by open pile-work. This pier is prolonged by a submersible dike about 500 yards long, composed of rough stone-work for 150 yards and continued in strong pile-work the remainder of its length ; the top of this dike is from 3 to 9 feet above the level of low water. The Avant port is immediately within the piers and through it is the channel to the Tidal port and also to the entrance to the Bassin-a-flot ; it is in fact a part of the Tidal port. The Tidal port is the most important division of the harbour. At its southern end is the Inner port, which serves as the reservoir or Retenue de Chasses, for flushing the channel, and which might at any time be utilized for shipping if required. The inner end of the N.E. pier joins the quai Gambetta, which extends the whole length of the Avant Port and Tidal port, a distance of about 950 yards, 400 yards of the quay-wall having been just re-built, and on this side are berthed the Thames steamers, and are the landing-places for the goods traffic of the South-Eastern Railway ; La large space over 400 feet long is also being specially prepared for the transatlantic steamers. On the western side is the quai Chanzy, which separates the tidal port from the Bassin-a-flot, and, at its northern end is the railway station and the landing stage for the Folkestone steamers. There is also a slip-way for building or repairing small vessels, and a gridiron and careening place adjoining the slip. Depths. \u2014 The port admits vessels of the deepest draught at high water, springs, and of 27 feet draught at neaps. Dredging has been prosecuted with such effect that by the year 1893, where a bar, dry at low water, formerly existed, there was a clear channel up to the pier-heads with a least depth of 13 feet at the lowest tides ; 41^ feet at high water, springs ; and 36 feet at neaps. Between the piers and through the Avant port the depth was about the same, and in the Tidal port the depth was rather greater. Since then, dredging has been energetically pursued, with the view of enabling the largest ocean steamers to lie alongside its quays afloat at the lowest tides. For this purpose a low water depth of 26 feet has to be obtained, and with the greater part of the quai. Chanzy- this has been accom plished, but as regards the quai Gambetta the work is not so far advanced. See chart, No. 438."], [590, "CAPK D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. XL 562 > The Bassin-a-flot or wet dock is on the western side of the Tidal port, and its entrance is through a lock at its northern end. The Bassin has an area of 17 acres, being 430 yards long, 186 yards wide, and with a quay frontage of 1,150 yards. The lock has double gates, the entrance is 69 feet wide between them, and 328^ feet in length ; the depth over the sills is 29J? feet at high water, springs, and 23i feet at neaps. The dock itself has rather more water, but the bottom is hard and only lightly coated with mud. The lock gates are open from 3 to 3^ hours every- tide. Coals can be obtained in moderate quantities. Vessels coal without difficulty either in the Tidal port or in the Bassin-a-flot. Slight repairs to machinery can be effected, but, there being no dry dock, serious defects of hull cannot be made good. Stores and supplies generally are cheap and plentiful. Trade, &C. \u2014 The general trade of the port is extensive. In 1893 the number of vessels entering was 2,522, of an aggregate of 778,000 tons. The principal imports are coal, wool, machinery, timber, beer, jute, cotton, &c. ; the exports, wine, spirits, cement, fruit and vegetables, Parisian articles, &c, &c. The herring and mackerel fisheries employ a considerable capital and several vessels are fitted out for the Iceland cod fishery. The coasting trade is active ; two lines of transatlantic steamers make this a port of call ; there is daily communication by steamer with Folkestone, thus connecting the South-Eastern Railway of England with the Northern Railway of France, and several times a week with London and Goole. LIGHTS. \u2014 The following lights mark the Carnot breakwater and the entrance to Boulogne harbour :\u2014 Camot breakwater. \u2014 From a lighthouse standing on a white reservoir at the breakwater end is exhibited, at 42 feet above the sea. a flashing white light, visible 8 miles.

This light is obscured by the tidal lighthouse when bearing between S. 23\u00b0 E. and S. 27\u00b0 E. N.E. pier. \u2014 A fixed red light, visible 6 miles, is exhibited at 46 feet above the level of high water, from a white tower 33 yards from the N.E. pier-head. A fixed green light is exhibited at 33 feet above high water from an iron pole by a hut on the N.E. pier-head : it stands about 30 yards in advance of the lighthouse. The green and red lights in line show the direction of the sub mersible dike extending from the N.E. pier-head. The S.W. pier red light on with the N.E. pier red light E. by S. I S. leads about 150 yards northward of the end of the Carnot break water. Fog signals. \u2014 Two sirens, worked by compressed air, are sounded together on the S.W. pier-head, as follows : \u2014 One siren gives a continuous sound, the other of greater power gives a group of two sounds (low, high), about every 50 seconds ; each sound is of about 2^ seconds duration, and the two sounds of each group are separated by an interval of 4 seconds. Should the sirens be damaged, a bell is sounded about 50 times a minute ; see fog signals, page 11. Tide Signals. \u2014 The usual day tide signals, see page 12, are made from a signal-staff at the S.W. pier-head, commencing from a depth of 15i feet in the entrance channel. The entrance to the Bassin-a-flot being open, is indicated by day by the pilot flag being hoisted near the lock gates as well as at the pilot house at the inner end of the N.E. pier ; by night, by a green light on each side of the lock entrance, and by a green light at the pilot station. Prohibition to enter the harbour is signalled by day by the hoisting of a red flag at the S.W. pier-head, and also at the pilot station ; at night by the red colour of the tidal lights, and also a red See chart No. 438."], [592, "564 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. XL light at the pilot station. Should the prohibition be on account of the dredger being at work, and it would nevertheless be possible for vessels performing the regular passage service to pass, or for small craft entering at their own risk and peril, the red flags are hoisted half-mast, and the dredger, besides the regulation signals, shows a green flag on the side where the passage is free. The suspension of all movement in the port, to facilitate the entrance or departure of a vessel, is signalled, by day, by the hoisting of a retiflag bordered with green at the S.W. pier-head and at the pilot station ; at night, by a red light over a green light at each of those stations. When the sluices of the scouring waters are going to be opened a blue flag and black ball are hoisted at the S.W. pier-head flag-staff, and also at a staff near the sluice gates. Other signals are made from a mast at the inner end of the N.E. pier. A blue triangle indicates a ship approaching ; a red triangle by day, or a red light by- night, signals the approach of one of the regular Folkestone packets. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in the port of Boulogne at llh. 25m. ; ordinary springs rise 28i feet, neaps 23 feet above the zero of soundings, which is about 3J feet below the level of low water, ordinary springs. Ordinary springs range 25 \\ feet, n\u20ac>aps 15| feet. Strong westerly winds raise the tide a foot or two higher, and those from the eastward have a contrary effect. At springs, high water slack lasts about 20 minutes with westerly, and 1 5 minutes with easterly winds ; at neaps, about 40 minutes. Tidal streams.\u2014 At 3 miles westward of Boulogne, outside the Bassure de Baas, the flood or north-eastern stream commences 2j hours before and acquires its greatest strength, 3 knots, about the time of high water in the harbour, maintains it for about 2 hours, and ceases at 3\u00a3 hours after high water. The Carnot breakwater effectually- shields the harbour entrance from the tidal streams which are scarcely felt when within the line of that structure. Between the piers both flood and ebb streams run about 1^ knots if the sluices of the Inner port are open, otherwise the stream is almost nil.

Life-boats. \u2014 There are three life-boats stationed at Boulogne ; one is near the centre of the N.E. pier ; the second, northward of that pier on the beach, near the baths ; the third, southward of the harbour, at the end of the Chatillon sand-hills. BOULOGNE ROADS. \u2014 Good anchorage may be found for many vessels of about 20 feet draught under shelter of the breakwater, those of deeper draught than that should moor. There is also good anchorage in about 4| fathoms, 8 cables outside the pier-heads, on a narrow strip of hard clay about 7 cables long, North and South, and a cable wide. This space is bounded on its western side by the rocky bottom known as Vhiiitriere or the oyster bed, which begins at cape Alprech and extends without interruption northward as far as the parallel of Ambleteuse. Deep draught vessels may anchor farther out with Heurt fort, just open of cape Alprech. The best anchorage is between the lines of the colonnade of the cathedral on with the guard-house of Chatillon battery, which stands on the sand-hills a little southward of the S.W. pier; and, the fort on Mont Lambert on with the belfry tower in Haute Ville. Vessels of moderate draught may remain at this anchorage during fine weather, and, with a long scope of cable out, even if caught there by a strong westerly wind ; those of deep draught, however, would be in danger of touching bottom when tailing in-shore at low water. In fine weather, vessels may also anchor, well clear of the entrance channel, in about 10 fathoms, good holding-ground, at the eastern edge of the Bassure de Baas, abreast of Vimereux. If surprised here by strong north-easterly winds, they can make for Ambleteuse road (see page 568) ; or, if a south-westerly gale should oblige them to seek refuge, they can run for the Downs or take shelter to leeward of the coast in the neighbourhood of Calais. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 From the Westward. \u2014 Sailing vessels approaching Boulogne from the westward, with the wind between South and West, should take the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the Vergoyer bank, and if they arrive on the parallel of Mont St. Frieux at low water, and are of more than 15 feet draught, short tacks should be made in the channel between that parallel and Swichart, No. 438."], [594, "566 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ.

With the wind between South and East, the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the shore should be taken, and short boards made southward of the line of the column and lighthouse in one until the tide has risen sufficiently to enter the harbour ; or, weather permitting, they may anchor in Boulogne roads. Vessels of the deepest draught may at all times cross over the Bassure de Baas in front of Boulogne. One of the deepest parts is with the Grande Armee column on with the lighthouse on the S.W. pier, seen over the breakwater, bearing E. by N. ; but, as the harbour is neared, the pier-head lights should be opened of the break water ; and the N.E. pier red fight slightly opened northward of the S.W. pier red light at night, which line leads a cable northward of the breakwater end. From the Northward. \u2014 With the wind between North and West, vessels from the northward should pass westward of the Bassure de Baas, and, if the wind is fresh, they should wait outside this bank until the time for entering ; but, with a light wind, the bank should be crossed on the parallel of Creche point, and a position maintained a short distance to windward of the entrance. If the wind is between North and East, it is better to take the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the land and then anchor, if the weather permits, in such a position as to have the wind a point or two free for running into port. The high land in the vicinity of Boulogne modifies the direction of the wind in the harbour, and sometimes when it is S.S.W. outside it is South or S.S.E. within. Strong winds from the N.E. come off in violent squalls from the high land northward of the harbour. The best time to enter is during the last hour of the flood, when there is scarcely any stream. Sailing vessels should carry plenty of sail on entering the channel, in order to stem the eddies which may be found between the pier-heads, and, if the wind is off-shore, a boat should be sent for the tracking rope. Generally speaking, when the wind is from West round by South to N.E., steer close to the S.W. pier-head : with a fresh breeze from anywhere between N.E. and West keep in mid-channel ; and, in light winds, procure a steam-tug, or steer for the S.W. pier to take in the tracking rope.

If this occurs at half or three quarters of an horn- after high water, there is some chance of getting her afloat again, and at all events the crew are safe. Sailing vessels leaviug the port for the northward should do so as soon as they are afloat, and with a favourable wind may make sail at once from their berths. Those bound westward, unless with a fresh fair breeze outside to enable them to over-run the flood stream, should not quit the entrance channel until the latest moment, or they may have to anchor outside to await the ebb stream. The COAST.\u2014 Creche point, bearing N.E. by N. 1J- miles from Boulogne S.W. pier-head, is, as well as the intermediate coast, high and steep, and is at the western extreme of the range of hills separating the valley of the Liane from that watered by the river Vimille, on one of the highest points of which range stands the column of the Grande Armee, before described. The coast continues steep for nearly a mile from Creche point, but from thence to Vimereux it is bordered by high sand-hills. About 8 cables N.N.E. from Creche point and 2^ cables from the shore is the small semi-circular fort of Croi with two tiers of embrasures, built on rocks which uncover at low water, and rising 50 feet above the level of the beach. From Vimereux to Oies point, which bears N.N.E. easterly 2 miles from Creche point, the coast is steep, but from thence to Audrecelles village, 2 miles farther northward, it is bordered by sand-hills of middling, height covered with verdure. At 1| miles northward of Oies point is the village of Ambleteuse, built on the northern side of the remains of its harbour, and, with the windmill on the high ground northward of the village, easily recognisable from the sea. Amble teuse fort, like that of Croi, had two tiers of guns. From Ambleteuse to the village of Audrecelles, the shore consists of sand-hills covered with bent grass and intersected by small rivulets, through which the sea runs in upon the land at high water. This village stands on the shore, and the church and windmills behind the village are conspicuous objects. From Audrecelles to Riden point, about 2 miles farther northward, the land adjoining the shore gradually rises and forms a succession of hills separated from Sec chart. No. 43s.

Between Ambleteuse and the rocks at Oies point, the beach is of sand and dries out 3i cables ; but, from Ambleteuse to Riden point its breadth decreases and it consists of rocks covered with sand. The coast from Riden point to cape Grisnez is bordered by a rocky shelf of which the projecting points do not extend beyond 1^ cables from the foot of the cliffs. Coasters, with off-shore winds, should be cautious when approaching the shore between Croi fort and Audrecelles, as a shoal bottom of uneven rock, with about 10 feet water, extends 5 or 6 cables from the coast. Vimereux, formerly a harbour, is 1\u00a3 miles north-eastward of Creche point, at the head of a small elbow in the shore between that and Oies point. The harbour was formed, at the commencement of the present century, at the mouth of the river Vimille, to accommo date vessels of the flotilla intended for the invasion of England ; a freshet of that river having in after years broken down the sluice gates, the channel and piers were soon destroyed and the harbour filled up with sand and shingle. The waters of the river still follow their old channel but the bottom has risen so much that, at springs, there are only 5 or 6 feet in what used to be the harbour ; its destruction has caused the almost total desertion of the village which is now nearly covered with sand. Ambleteuse, a mile northward of Oies point, is, like Vimereux, so far as its harbour is concerned, in a complete state of ruin ; it is at the mouth of the little river Slack and great improvements were made at the beginning of the ipresent century with the same object as at Vimereux. The ruins of a stone jetty-head and some piles in the north-western part of the harbour still mark the outline of a basin in which the vessels of the flotilla were placed, but it is now filled with sand and mud and has only 4 feet water in it at springs. The village has some reputation as a watering place. Life-boat. \u2014 A life-boat is stationed at Audrecelles, about a mile northward of Ambleteuse fort.

Vessels of deep draught bound to the northern ports of the channel, or to Calais or Dunkerque, await spring tides in this road if they arrive during neaps with northerly winds, and are fairly sheltered during gales from N.E. round by East to South ; the sea, however, is very heavy- here when it blows strongly on a weather tide. The best anchorage is between the parallel of Vimereux and the line of the church towers of Ambleteuse and Bazinghen in one E. | N., and a little in-shore of the rocky ground forming the western limit of the anchorage of Boulogne and which extends northward to the parallel of Ambleteuse. By not anchoring eastward of the small tower of Renard, a mile south-eastward of Portel, on with Boulogne S.W. pier lighthouse S. \\ W., large vessels are in a good position to weigh should it blow strongly from the westward. A good berth for a vessel of deep draught is N.W. by W. of Vimereux, with Renard tower open 3\u00b0 westward of Boulogne S.W. pier lighthouse, in about 8 fathoms hard muddy clay ; or, in 9 fathoms, good holding-ground of muddy sand, with the lighthouse and Renard tower in line ; and, Bazinghen church tower open a little northward of Ambleteuse fort E. by N. Large merchant vessels may anchor in 7 fathoms, hard sand and broken shells, on the latter bearing ; and, with the column of the Grande Armee on with Croi fort. Boulogne pilots call the space between the eastern edge of the Bassure de Baas and the rocky bottom which bounds the anchorage in Ambleteuse road, the Parfondingue ; they state that ships of the deepest draught, requiring to remain some days in the road, should be placed in the Parfondingue between the lines of the column of the Grande Armee on with the southern slope of Creche point, and Bazinghen tower on with Ambleteuse fort ; here they have sufficient room to weigh and round cape Grisnez if it comes on to blow hard from the S.W. ; or, if it shifts to West or N.W., the crest of the bank shelters them from the heavy sea. To ride out a gale, they should be moored with open hawse to the westward and their anchors laid with a long scope of cable N.E. and S.W. in the direction of the tidal streams.

The south-going stream is less rapid, continues longer, and ends 2^ hours before high water. The direction of the wind has great influence on both streams. CAPE GRISNEZ is 8^ miles northward of Boulogne ; from it, cape Alprech bears S. by W. f W. 10^ miles ; Dungeness W.N.W. 2H miles ; South Foreland N. by W. 17| miles ; and, Beachy Head W. -| N. 52^ miles. This cape, 167 feet high, is one of the most remarkable headlands on the northern coast of France and is visible in clear weather 14 or 15 miles ; from it, the coast changes its direction abruptly eastward, and this precipitous rocky sandstone cliff, as well as those southward and eastward of it, is of a dark grey colour and takes a purple tint when lighted up by the sun. A lighthouse stands on the south-western extreme of a small spot of level land crowning the cape ; some works of defence may also be seen rising above the same level land, and a guard-house at its extreme near the crest of the cliff. Large masses of rock lie at the foot of the cape, and a rocky shelf, partly covered with sand, dries at low water 2\\ cables out from the cliffs ; the cape should therefore, be given a berth of at least 4 cables when passing it. LIGHT. \u2014 Cape Grisnez lighthouse is circular, 79 feet high from base to vane, a quarter of a mile southward of the cape, and about 100 yards from the edge of the cliff : it exhibits at 226 feet above high water an electric groupj-fiashing light, showing three white flashes followed by a red flash. The white flashes are of J seconds each, the red flash, \\ second ; the total eclipse between the white flashes is of If seconds duration ; between the white and red flash, 4^ seconds. It is visible 22 miles, but, in ordinary weather, the luminous glare caused by it can be seen as much as 35 or 40 miles distant. This light cannot be mistaken for the light at Calais, which is also electric and white, but shows successive groups of four white flashes, with an interval of six seconds between each group ; nor for the red flashing light at cape Alprech, which has a five seconds period.

PAS de CALAIS.\u2014 The narrowest part of this channel is 8| miles wide, between the Ridge or Colbart shoal and cape Grisnez ; from thence, it runs nearly parallel with the coast as far as Boulogne, and then in a S.W. by W. \\ W. direction between the Bassurelle and Vergoyer shoals. With easterly winds, it is to be preferred to the Dover channel between the Varne and the English shore ; it is both wider and deeper, and is a continuation of the deep soundings channel of the North sea in which the depth is above 20 fathoms. It is easily navigated by the lead either with a leading or beating wind, and even during fog or snow, the only danger being the northern end of the Ridge which rises abruptly from a depth of 20 fathoms. To avoid the northern end of the Ridge, a vessel turning to wind ward in the Pas de Calais, either by day or night, when northward of the parallel of cape Grisnez and standing westward, should not bring the South Foreland lighthouses eastward of N. \u00a3 E. ; and, when southward of that parallel, she should not go into less than 20 fathoms A bearing of the Varne light-vessel is also very useful for avoiding this shoal. Tides and tidal streams. \u2014 (See also table, page 573) \u2014 It is high water, full and change, on the beach a little eastward of cape Grisnez at llh. 27m., extraordinary springs rise 27 feet, ordinary springs 21^ feet, neaps 16| feet above the level of the lowest tides ; at Dungeness, at lOh. 45m., springs rise 21 1 feet, neaps 19 feet ; and, at the Varne and Ridge shoals, at lOh. 40m. Within a circuit of 2 miles round the cape, the streams run stronger than at a greater distance from the shore ; the flood, or north-eastern stream, beginning 2 hours before and ending 3\u00a3 hours after high water at Boulogne, and running 4 knots when at its greatest strength, at springs. Between the Ridge and the French shore, the north-eastern stream runs with much greater strength than the south-western. The tidal streams, on the French coast, in the northern in-shore part of the English channel are nearly of the same duration as in the bay of the Seine, the north-eastern stream running about 5\u00a3 hours, and the south-western stream 6i hours. Towards the middle of the channel, the streams run straight, throughout its length, until they See chart, No. 1,895."], [600, "572 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRISNEZ. [Chap. XL have attained their greatest strength, when they follow the bends of the coast to a distance of 7 miles in the offing. In-shore of these limits, as soon as the north-eastern stream begins to be felt it turns towards the shore, but, as its strength increases, it tends more to its principal direction, viz., that which it follows when at its greatest strength and retains for the greatest length of time ; when its rate begins to decrease, it turns off-shore and takes different directions until the end of the tide. The south-western stream runs with less velocity and undergoes the same changes, but with this difference, that it varies much more in direction. At the Varne and Ridge shoals, the tide rises for 4^ hours before the north-eastern stream commences, and falls for 4f hours before the south-western stream begins ; making 6^ hours of north-eastern and b\\ hours of south-western stream. Strong south-westerly gales prolong the north-eastern stream nearly an hour, and retard propor tionally the south-western stream ; so that on some occasions, on the Ridge especially, 8 hours north-eastern and only 4 hours south western streams have been found. The rate of both streams increases in proportion to the narrowing of the channel. Between the Ver goyer and the shore, both streams make about an hour sooner than farther in the offing. Caution. \u2014 The deep bight in the coast between capes d'Antifer and Grisnez constrains the flood stream to change its direction about the meridian of point d'Ailly, and to turn E. by N. obliquely towards the coast Between the river Somme and cape Grisnez ; but, with strong westerly winds, it runs much farther eastward and turns suddenly only a short distance from the shore, causing a high sea. Vessels from the westward bound to ports in the northern part of the channel, and running with a strong westerly wind, cannot be too attentive to the effects of this stream ; as soon as they have sighted either cape Barfleur light, or that on St. Catherine point, they should act with great caution to avoid being set over on the French coast and should sound frequently after passing the meridian of cape d'Antifer, for, if they take the ground on any of the banks off the Somme or on the low coast in its vicinity, it will in all probability involve the loss of vessel and crew.

The COAST from cape Grisnez trends E. by N.fN. 6 miles to cape Blanc-Nez, the intermediate land is high and may be seen in clear weather from 15 to 20 miles distant ; but, beyond the latter cape, the shore bends more eastward, the high land turns in a south-easterly direction towards the interior, and a level plain extends from its foot to the coast where it terminates in a low sandy shore bordered by ranges of sand-hills, of which the highest are visible only from 7 to 10 miles. Between the capes, the shore forms a slight bay, at the head of which is the village of Wissant, inhabited by fishermen. At 2 miles inland from Wissant is Mont Couple, 525 feet above the sea level. From about a mile eastward of cape Grisnez, where the sandstone cliffs of that cape terminate, to 1^ miles north eastward of Wissant, where steep chalk cliffs recommence, the coast is low and bordered by sand-hills.* Cape Blanc-Nez owes its name to the high chalk cliff in which it terminates. It forms no marked projection, but its position may be recognized from a good distance at sea by the guard-house on the summit of the steep mound which crowns it, and which is the northern extreme of a range of hills joining Mont Couple.

The holding-ground is not so good near the shore. w\u2014 >'. Cf-\"\" The anchorage is sheltered by the land from W.S.W. round to S.E., but it is quite open in all other directions. The Riden can scarcely be considered as a shelter, although the waves break with great violence during a northerly gale on its whole extent ; the sea, how ever, is much quieter here than in the offing, and a vessel with good ground gear might ride out a gale in the northern part of the road. Semaphore.\u2014 There is a Semaphore station on the shore about 6 cables westward of Calais West pier ; see page 12. CALAIS.* \u2014 This port is entirely artificial and consists of an Entrance channel, Outer port, Import dock, and the small Bassin du Petit Paradis, all of which are tidal, but well sheltered from wind and sea ; though when it blows strongly from the northward all the tidal portion of the port is more or less affected by the swell. Also of a Wet dock under the ramparts of the citadel, opening from the Import dock ; the Bassin Carnot, entered from the south-eastern end of the Outer port, with a dry dock at its head ; and, at its south western corner, an inner basin, communicating with a basin for small craft, which latter communicates also with the western Wet dock and Import dock, and with the general canal system of the country. The quays are all connected by rail with the central railway station and thus with all parts of Europe ; they are well equipped with hydraulic cranes and all the most modern appliances for the speedy discharging and loading of vessels, and with extensive sheds and bonding stores. The entrance of the port is 11^ miles eastward of cape Grisnez ; S.E. \\ E. 21^ miles from Dover pier-head : and, S.E. 20^ miles from the South Foreland. Calais owes its importance to its geographical position, which makes it the most convenient port for passengers and mails between the Continent and the United Kingdom, when time is the all important object. The harbour has undergone great improvements both in depth and general accommodation of late years, including vast * See Admiralty plan of Calais, No. 2,556 ; scale, m = 5 inches."], [607, "Chap. XII.] 579 CALAIS.\u2014 ENTRANCE CHANNEL. works, completed in 1896, for widening the entrance, as also constant dredging to maintain the depth gained. It is not only connected direct with Paris by rail, but also both by rail and canal with Gravelines, Dunkerque, and all the industrial region of Belgium and the North of France. Mariners should also remember that when it blows strongly from between West and South and the approach to Boulogne is hazardous for sailing vessels, Calais can be entered with comparative ease ; and, on the contrary, when it blows hard between North and E.N.E. and it is impossible to enter Calais, Boulogne can be entered with safety. Calais had, in 1891, a population of about 60,000 ; it has consider able foreign and a brisk coasting trade ; the vessels belonging to the port are chiefly employed in the cod, herring, and mackerel fisheries. The principal imports are coal, iron, machinery, wood, jute, petroleum, woollens, cottons, &c. ; the exports, sugar, metal ware, glass and porcelain, eggs, silks, Parisian goods, <fcc. The number of vessels entering the port annually is about 2,000, of an aggregate of 350,000 tons. Mail steamers cross the channel between Dover and Calais three times each way daily, the distance being accomplished under ordinary circumstances in about 1^ hours. Consulate. \u2014 A British Consul and Vice-Consul are stationed at Calais. Entrance Channel. \u2014 Great improvements have been made in this channel by the construction of the new East pier, which is now completed and the old pier entirely removed ; the channel is therefore now 430 feet wide between the pier-heads, and still wider within; it runs about 4| cables in a S.S.E. direction from the pier-heads to the Outer port. About 800 feet of the outer part of both piers consists of open pile-work, intended to prevent the accumulation of sand ; through this open work, as well as across the entrance, both flood and ebb streams sweep with great strength and at right angles to the direction of the channel, causing serious inconvenience and requiring much skill in the handling of vessels entering or leaving at or near high water when the north-eastern stream is running at its greatest strength. The West pier has a small opening, about 1\u00a3 cables from the end, to enable boats to load with sand from that side. At its inner end, it terminates in the towing path passing under the glacis of Fort Risban. See plan, No. 2,556."], [608, "[Chap. XII 580 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. Scouring basins. \u2014 On each side of the Entrance channel are large scouring basins, their united area being about 440 acres ; these are filled each tide and discharged through the channel at low water in order to maintain the depth and disperse any bar formation, but it is intended eventually to convert both these scouring basins into wet docks. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Calais harbour at llh. 49m. ; springs rise 22| feet, neaps 19 feet above the level of the soundings, which level or zero is about H feet below the level of low water, ordinary springs. With westerly gales, the tide rises a foot or two higher than in fine settled weather. High water slack lasts, at springs, for about 20 minutes ; at neaps, for as much as 45 minutes. Depths. \u2014 Caution. \u2014 In 1890, the entrance channel was dredged to a least depth of 10 feet below the zero of soundings. In 1892, there was a general average of 6 inches deeper water, and at the present time, December 1896, a depth of 13 feet below the zero of soundings is maintained ; this gives a depth in the entrance channel of 35Jj feet at high water springs, and of 3i feet less at high water, neaps. It must, however, be borne in mind that from the exposed condition of Calais harbour, unusual difficulties lie in the way of maintaining an equable and thoroughly reliable depth in the entrance channel, for during a continuance of heavy weather the movement of the sand along the coast has always a tendency to the formation of a bar across and in the channel ; and although, on the one band, great improvements in depth have been made and fairly maintained, it must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that temporary shoaling may take place, against which possibility the mariner should be on his guard. The Outer port is tidal and begins where the East pier joins the wall of the quay opposite Fort Risban. This quay is 600 yards in length and is that used by the Dover and Calais mail steamers ; its space is wholly occupied by the railway station. There are 16 feet water alongside this quay at low water, springs, the central depths of the Outer port leading up to the lock entrances to the Bassin Carnot being from 19 to 25 feet, and its width 186 yards. The South quay of the Outer port is 273 yards long, with 25 feet water alongside at low water, springs. See plan, No. 2,656."], [609, "Chap. XII.] CALAIS. \u2014 DEPTHS. \u2014 BASINS AND DOCKS. 581 The Bassin Carnot is opened 2| hours before high water and closed 2 hours after high water slack. It is entered from the Outer port by two locks, one 436 feet, the other 451 feet long ; the first is 69 feet wide in the entrance, the other 46| feet ; both have 28 feet 9 inches over the sjll at high water, springs. The mean length of the Bassin Carnot is 1,033 yards, its width 158 yards, its area 23 acres, and its bottom is 1 foot 8 inches below the level of the lock sills. On its eastern side is a 40-ton hydraulic crane, besides, as before mentioned, railways and every convenience for loading and discharging cargo, storage, &c, on all its spacious quays. Dry dock. \u2014 At the head of the Bassin Carnot is the dry dock, 508 feet in length over all, width of entrance 68| feet, and depth over sill at high water, springs, 28| feet. This dock can receive a vessel 498 feet in length. Space has been reserved for the construction of two additional docks. Inner basin and Canal dock. \u2014 At the south-western corner of the Bassin Carnot is the Inner basin, a space about 200 yards long and 66 yards wide, from which the Canal dock or basin for small craft is entered by means of two locks 236^ feet long, with entrances 19 j feet wide. The Canal dock also communicates with the western Wet dock, presently described, by means of a lock 230 feet in length by 17 feet 1 inch in width. The Canal dock has an area of 10 acres, and from it the largest sized canal boats of 400 tons can proceed by the inland waterways of the North of France, and between Belgium and Paris. Import dock. \u2014 Reverting to the Outer port ; on its south-western side is the wide opening into the Import dock, also tidal, as well as the Bassin du Petit Paradis on its southern side. This dock dries at low water and has a depth of 20^ feet at high water, springs. It has, including the Bassin du Petit Paradis, 1,800 yards of quayage, with all facilities for loading and unloading, and excellent grounding berths. A careening gridiron is established at the western end of this dock. Wet dock.\u2014 The western Wet dock has its entrance at the head of the Import dock ; it is opened 2 hours before high water and closed l-\\ hours after high water slack. It has an area of 20,000 square yards, with 590 yards extent of quays. The entrance between the gates is 55f feet wide, and the sill is at the level of low water, springs. Its length is 410 yards, and its width 82 yards. It Set plan, No. 2,556."], [610, "[Chap.

LIGHTS.\u2014 Calais lighthouse, an octagonal brick tower 167 feet high, stands at the north-eastern side of the town, and exhibits, at 190 feet above high water and visible 20 miles, an electric, group-flashing, white light, showing successive groups of four white flashes ; each flash is of three quarters of a second duration ; the total eclipse between each flash of a group is of two seconds, and, between each group, of six seconds duration. West pier. \u2014 A fixed red light, 26 feet above high water and visible 4 miles, is exhibited from an iron pole erected on an iron shed at the outer end of the West pier. This light is not shown in bad weather, access to the West pier-head being then impracticable. East pier. \u2014 Tide lights. \u2014 From a white metal tower on the East pier-head, at about 31 feet above high water, the following tide lights, visible 10 miles, are shown ; they consist of fixed red, green, and white lights, varied by red and green flashes, and. indicate by colour and flashes every ten inches of rise after the tide has risen 6Js feet above the zero or level of the soundings on the chart, thus : \u2014 A fixed red light indicates less than 6^ feet above the zero of soundings, but tide rising. A. fixed green light indicates less than 6^ feet above the zero and tide falling. A fixed white light indicates from 6^ feet to 1\\ feet above the zero. A fixed white light varied by groups of red and green flashes indicates depths of more than 1\\ feet above the zero. The groups of coloured flashes are separated by intervals of eighty seconds, and the flashes in each group by intervals of five seconds ; each red flash showing an additional 3 feet 4 inches to the initial height of 65 feet above the zero of soundings, and each green flash adding 10 inches more. Whilst the tide is rising, the fixed, light, whether red or white, is eclipsed for a short interval every eighty seconds ; and, when it is falling, the fixed light, white or green, is eclipsed twice in quick succession every eighty seconds ; these eclipses occur nearly in the See plan.

Caution. \u2014 When unforeseen circumstances make the entrance to the harbour dangerous, the night tide signals will be replaced by a red fixed light shown from the round point of the East pier-head. Day tide Signals.\u2014 The usual day tide signals are made from a flagstaff near the lighthouse on the East pier-head ; see page 12. Fog Signals. \u2014 A bell is sounded continuously in foggy weather at the East pier-head if the port is accessible ; and, in addition, when a mail steamer is clue, a gun is fired from the same pier-head every five minutes ; see fog signals, page 11. Harbour Signals. \u2014 A white flag with blue border, hoisted at the Harbour Master's office indicates that the dock gates are open ; the same flag at the look-out on the East pier, near bastion No. 1, indicates that the Bassin Carnot is open ; when hoisted near the entrance to the western sluicing basin, that the western dock is open. At night, two green lights are shown on each side of any lock entrance which may be open, but neither the Carnot nor the western wet dock are open at night, except after due notice given. Pilots. \u2014 Fourteen pilots are stationed at Calais ; they cruise in two small schooners, the one as far westward asDungeness, the other as far northward as the Galloper light-vessel. The first pilot met with should be taken, but the pilotage fee does not increase for any distance beyond 10 miles from the port. When pilots are not able to get to sea, they indicate to approaching vessels the course to be steered by means of a mast working on a hinge at the East pier head ; this mast is inclined towards the side towards which the vessel should steer. Coal, Supplies, &C. \u2014 A moderate quantity of coal at reasonable prices is always in store, and there is every facility for vessels of the largest size to coal afloat, either in the wet docks or alongside the South quay of the Outer port. Supplies of all sorts are plentiful and good. Repairs can be executed, and the facilities for doing so are improving as the new dry dock comes more into use. Steam-tugS. \u2014 Several steam-tugs are attached to the port. See plan, No. 2,556. 2 O SO 11886"], [612, "[Chap. XII. 584 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQTJE. Life-boats.\u2014 In case of shipwreck, there is a life-preserving mortar and apparatus at three distinct stations at Calais, and also two life-boats ; one of the latter is stationed on the eastern side, the other on the western side of the harbour. Tidal Streams. \u2014 The mean duration of the flood or east-going stream, at springs, in front of the entrance is 5| hours, and of the west-going stream 7 \\ hours. At 5 cables outside the piers, the eastern stream runs for 2\\ or 3 hours after high water in the harbour, aud with strong westerly winds, for 4| or 5 hours after; with easterly winds, it continues only 1\\ or 2 hours after high water in the harbour. The rate of the flood at extraordinary springs is 4^ knots. DIRECTIONS. \u2014 From the westward. \u2014 As a general rule, cape Blanc-Nez should be sighted when bound either to Calais, Gravelines, or Dunkerque. The most favourable winds for a sailing vessel entering Calais harbour are those from W.S.W. round by North to East. Moderate on-shore winds only cause a heavy swell on the beach, but when strong they send in a heavy sea, and it is then dangerous to enter. Under these circumstances, which are frequent in winter, vessels bound for the northern ports of France should immediately run for Boulogne ; and, it should be borne in mind that at this, and at all French ports of any importance a red flag is shown at the tide signal-staff when the port is rendered inaccessible by weather. Vessels running for Calais from the south-west, when on the parallel of and about a mile from cape Grisnez, should steer about N.E. by E. \\ E., taking care not to bring the extreme of that cape westward of S.W. \\ W. in order to keep outside the Barriere and Quenocs rocks. When Sangatte church tower is on with Coquelles windmill, S.E., steer about E. by S. \\ S. towards Calais lighthouse, and, when Audinghen church tower, near cape Grisnez, is hidden behind the cliff at cape Blanc-Nez, if there is water sufficient to enter the harbour a course should be shaped for the entrance ; if not, anchor in the southern part of Calais road. Small vessels may pass at all times of tide between the Quenocs and the Barriere, by keeping Sangatte church tower on with either of the three towers of Calais ; they may also pass between the Rouge-Riden and the shore, from half flood to half ebb. See chart, No, 1,895,"], [613, "Chap. XII.] CALAIS. \u2014 DIRECTIONS. \u2014 ENTERING HARBOUR. 585 At night, cape Grisnez light should not be brought westward of S.W. \u00a3 W., to avoid the Barriere and the Quenocs, and when Calais light bears E.S.E., steer about E. by S. ; then if the ebb or western stream is running, anchor as soon as cape Grisnez light is about to be hidden behind the cliff at cape Blanc-Nez ; but, if the flood is making, and there is sufficient water in the entrance, steer for the red light on the West pier-head which must be rounded fairly close to, if the tide is setting to the eastward. From the northward.\u2014 Between one third flood and two thirds ebb in Calais harbour, either by day or night, vessels from the north ward with a fresh fair wind may run directly for the entrance over the Riden de Calais, where there is then sufficient water. If late on the ebb, run on the meridian of Blanc-Nez until Sangatte church tower is on with Coquelles windmill S.E. ; then steer, if the weather is favourable, for the anchorage in the southern part of Calais road. At night, steer for Calais light on an E.S.E. bearing until cape Grisnez light bears W.S.W., then steer about E. S. and look out for cape Grisnez light becoming masked behind cape Blanc-Nez, when anchor if the ebb stream is running ; or, if the flood, steer for the harbour. Entering the harbour. \u2014 The most favourable time for entering Calais harbour with an on-shore wind is at high water ; but, with the wind abeam or ahead, half or three quarters of an hour sooner, so as to allow time to be tracked or towed up to the quays, or to the dock entrances. The set of the tidal streams should be borne in mind, however, see preceding page, and, therefore, whatever the direction of the wind, if the eastern stream is running, the West pier-head should be steered for, and this precaution is particularly necessary when standing for the harbour on the starboard tack ; anchors should be ready for letting go, and hawsers ready to run out in the event of being drifted on the East pier. Plenty of sail should be carried, especially with the wind right aft, to stem the flood and to pass quickly through the swell at the entrance. Should a vessel with a strong westerly wind and without a pilot miss the entrance, she should anchor immediately as near as possible to the East pier-head and take in a pilot, whose assistance will then be indispensable.

Vessels may get out of harbour and gain an offing on a. weather Ude. against a head wind by making sail from the end of the West pier. BANKS off the NORTH COAST of FRANCE.\u2014 The approach to the low and dangerous coast between Calais and the river Schelde, for the description of which, see p. 602, is obstructed by numerous banks of grey and black sand, which extend 15 miles from the shore on the meridian of Calais, and 42 miles in a north-easterly direction from Dunkerque. They are all long and narrow, and con verge in direction towards the straits of Dover. Their shoalest parts may be touched upon by vessels of almost any draught, and the eddies they occasion cause a hollow sea which breaks when it blows hard. Those farthest from the land lie on the eastern side of the 20-fathoms line of soundings, which, in the southern part of the North sea, is the eastern limit of the Deep-soundings channel, which begins in Dover strait and ends in about lat. 53\u00b0 20' N. The banks are all steep-to on their in-shore edge and extend with a gentle slope towards the offing, and, as they rise from the submarine bank of sand, gravel, and broken shells which joins the shore, and on which there are everywhere less than 20 fathoms, the simple precaution of not going into less than that depth ensures keeping outside all these banks. The lights at cape Grisnez and Calais are in a good position to point out at night their western limit ; the electric flashing light at Dunkerque, seen in clear weather 20 miles, gives notice of approach to the greater part of them, and the navigation is still further facilitated by the two light-vessels moored within the Hinder banks, by that north-eastward of the Ruytingen, and by others more in-shore. The dangers of the in-shore navigation can only be avoided by placing the vessel in charge of a good pilot, for the banks are all so liable to changes in their formation that no description of them can be considered permanently reliable ; generally speaking, none of the banks should be approached except a vessel is bound for one of the harbours on the coast. The banks are divided into. two groups, those nearest the shore eleven in number, being named the Dunkerque banks ; others, six in number, lying .some distance from the coast and northward of the Dunkerque banks, were but little known until surveyed by the late Captain W. Hewett, R.N., in H.M.S. Fairy between 1831-1840 ; Set charts, Nos. 1,895 and 1,873,"], [615, "Chap.

Caution. \u2014 As regards the very slight rise of tide experienced on some of the outer banks, see page 622. DUNKERQUE BANKS, eleven in number, extend 15 miles from the coast between the meridians of Calais and the frontier of Belgium. Their names are, the Sandettie, Outer Ruytingen, Inner Ruytingen, Bergues, Dyck (the north-eastern part of which is called the Clif-d'Islande or East Dyck), Inner Katel, Outer Ratel, Haut-fond de Gravelines, Breedt, Smal, and the bank bounding Dunkerque road to the northward, of which different parts are named Snouw, Braeck, Hills, and Traepegeer. Sandettie, in Flemish the Zand-detie, called also by local French mariners the Ourting, is the, outer and westernmost of the Dun kerque banks ; it is l?,i miles long E. by N. \\ N. and W. by S.-|.S., its breadth varying from 4 cables to a mile.

The Outer Ruytingen, midway between the coast of France arid the Sandettie, is separated from the latter by a channel from 5 to 6 miles wide, with soundings of from 14 to 20 fathoms. Its western end is about 7 miles from the shore on the meridian of Calais lighthouse ; from thence, it extends 7 miles eastward and then curves 9 miles in an E.N.E. direction to the position of the light vessel, beyond which to the 10-fathoms line it extends 2\\ miles farther, but with nothing less than 7 fathoms. The bank rises almost perpendicularly from the bottom on its south-eastern side, but falls with a gentle slope north-westward. Those parts on which there are less than 5 fathoms water form two flats, with a channel of from 5 to 9 fathoms and 2 miles wide between them ; from the centre of this channel, Gravelines light house bears S.S.E. \\ E., and Calais lighthouse S.W. \\ S. ; vessels bound to either of these ports may pass over the shoal between these flats at any time of tide, leaving Nos. 2 and 4 buoys on the starboard hand and No. 7 buoy on the port hand ; see Caution, page 589.

The south-western end of the shoal in 8 fathoms commences N.N.E. | E. G miles from Calais lighthouse, and S by E. \\ E. 2 miles from the Outer Ruytingen West buoy ; from thence, it extends eastward nearly parallel with the shore for 18 miles, almost to the meridian of Dunkerque, and then trends N.E. \\ E. 13| miles. The part between its western extreme and the meridian of Gravelines is named the West Dyck or Orteil ; the central part, between Gravelines and Grande Synthe, the Middle or the Dyck ; and, the eastern part is the East Dyck or Clif-dTslande. West Dyck or Orteil is 9 miles in length, and its greatest breadth is about 5 cables. From the least depth, 18 feet, Gravelines lighthouse bears South 5fj miles ; and, the Dyck light-vessel S.S.E. f E. 3} miles. For 1} miles eastward and 2\\ miles west ward of this Shoal part, the depths are from 19 to 25 feet, and, near the western extreme of the bank are patches with 33 feet. Small vessels should avoid passing near some patches of from 7 to 10 fathoms which lengthen out this bank westward almost to the meridian of Calais, as there is a confused sea on their edges with a fresh breeze and weather tide. Middle Dyck or The Dyck is one continuous flat, f>\\ miles long E. by N. and W. by S., from 5 to 8 cables wide, and has from one to 5 fathoms water, the shoalest spot being near the eastern end. The 5-fathoms limit of the bank commences N.N.E. \\ E. 6 miles from Gravelines lighthouse, and ends N. by W. \u00a3 W. 7 miles from Dun kerque lighthouse. The shoalest part of this flat is 4 miles long, on which the depths vary from 6 to 12 and 18 feet. From the centre to the eastern end it is extremely dangerous, being steep-to on all sides, but especially towards the North-west, where, at 2 cables distance, there are from 14 to 15 fathoms water, The Dyck light-vessel in line with Gravelines lighthouse S.S.W. \\ W. leads between the West and Middle Dyck in about 19 feet water.

It is very dangerous throughout its whole extent, as it rises abruptly like a wall from soundings of from 11 to 17 fathoms. Its shoalest part, a flat 3 miles long, on the greater part of which there are only from 6 to 9 feet, commences near the south western end of the bank and extends north-eastward to the meridian of Dunkerque lighthouse. On the other flats of the bank the depths are irregular, varying from 10 to 17 feet. The north-eastern end of the East Dyck is a formidable danger ; here there are only from 3 to 4 fathoms and the sea is always disturbed around it, as it rises abruptly from depths of 15 and 17 fathoms and is therefore difficult to be avoided by the lead, however quickly hove. From the shoal spot of 3 fathoms, the West Hinder light-vessel bears N.W. westerly 3| miles ; Dunkerque lighthouse S.W. by S. 19 miles ; and, Ostende lighthouse S.E. \\ E. 16^ miles ; but, this end of the bank being so far from the low land, the most remarkable objects can be recognised, even from the mast-head, only in very clear weather ; at such times, Dunkerque light may be seen 5 or 6 miles farther. DYCK LIGHT- VESSEL, moored in about 6 fathoms, 3 miles in-shore of the shoalest part of the West Dyke, with Gravelines pier-head lights bearing S.W. westerly 2| miles, shows at 39 feet above the sea, a flashing ivhite light visible 11 miles. The flashes occur every twenty seconds and are of five seconds duration, the eclipses being of fifteen seconds duration. The vessel is painted with red and black bands, has the word Dyck in white letters on each side, and carries a red cage at the mast-head.

Its extreme breadth, about a mile, is near the middle of the bank where there is a shoal flat 2 miles long with only from 1 to 9 feet water, and with less than 6 feet for more than a mile of its extent. From this dangerous part, Dunkerque lighthouse bears S. by E. | E. 5} miles. The channel separating the Inner Ratel from the Breeds in-shore of it, is barred between the western flats of these banks by a heap of sand on which are about 3} fathoms. There are 8 and 12 fathoms in the channel at a short distance eastward and westward of this bar. Outer Ratel is an isolated bank, and within the 5-fathoms line is 9 miles long and about a mile wide ; it lies south-eastward of and parallel with the East Dyck, from which it is separated by a deep channel from 2 to 2\\ miles wide. Its name, meaning rattle, is perhaps derived from the noise caused by the heavy sea on it in bad weather. Near its south-western end, about a mile northward of the eastern end of the Breeds, is a dangerous flat with only 8 feet water. From this shoal spot, Dunkerque lighthouse bears S.W. f S. 10 miles and from thence the bank extends N.E. byT E. 8^ miles, including the shoal patches of 3} and 4 fathoms near its north-eastern extreme. The Outer Ratel, having for 1\\ miles of its extent only from 9 to 15 feet water, should not be crossed, even by small vessels, without great care. It is separated from the East Dyck, as well as from the eastern end of the Breedt, by soundings of from 7 to 12 fathoms. A bank, 1} miles long with only 25 feet water, lies N.N.W. \\ W. 1^ miles from its north-eastern end, and is separated from it by soundings of from 8 to 13 fathoms.

The southern side rises precipitously from depths of 7| and 10 fathoms, rendering it exceedingly dangerous, but for the buoys marking its edge, to vessels turning to windward in the eastern part of Dunkerque road. Traepegeer bank bounds Dunkerque road eastward, and its western end forms the eastern side of the East or Zuydcoote pass. The Traepegeer joins the shore in the neighbourhood of Brours Duin, the high white sand-hill before mentioned, and from thence, as Brours bank, extends along the shore to the entrance of Nieuport. Its western extreme, on which there are from 7 to 13 feet water, is only 2 cables from the south-eastern angle of Hills bank, and bears N. \\ E. from Zuydcoote tower ; the outer part of the bank extends from 2^ to If miles from the shore, and the depths vary between 6 and 18 feet, though one part, near the centre and on the outer side, has only one foot water. BANKS NORTH Of DUNKERQUE BANKS\u2014 These banks, referred to at page 587, are dangerous, not only from their shallowness and their being so liable to change in form that anything but the latest charts may be very misleading, but also from their being at so great a distance from the shore and directly in the route of vessels bound for the Schelde. See also the caution at pages 622, 623, as to the slight rise of tide on these banks.

Buoy. \u2014 A red buoy with the word Hinder in white letters is moored in 6 fathoms at the northern end of the shoal flat of the North Hinder, and 2 miles North from the light-vessel. Vessels of deep draught should keep northward of the buoy if crossing the North Hinder, and must bear in mind that the buoy being in its correct position cannot be depended on. In line between the North Hinder and the Fairy are three flats, of which two, with from 8 to 10 fathoms water, occupy a space 3 miles in length midway between the banks ; the third, with 9 fathoms, lies 2 miles eastward of the northern end of the Fairy.

The western end of Thornton ridge lies S.S.E. 3 miles from the South extreme of Bligh bank, and the space between offers the least dangerous channel between the banks for large vessels bound north ward from Dunkerque with south-westerly winds. Light-buoy. \u2014 A red and ivhite chequered light-buoy, showing a quick flashing light, is moored in 6 fathoms a short distance north eastward of the shoal flat in (approximately) lat. 51\u00b0 34^' N., long. 3\u00b0 0^' E. ; from it, the Wandelaar light-vessel bears S. by W. \\ W. 12\u00a3 miles ; and, West Kapelle light S.E. by E. \u00a7 E. easterly 17 miles. Nearly midway between Bligh bank and Thornton ridge are three narrow banks occupying a space of 9 miles in an E.N.E. and W.S.W. direction, but with nothing less than from 8 to 9 fathoms. A succession of shoals, with from 6 to 9 fathoms water, also lie between Thornton ridge and the Outer Ratel, within sight of Ostende See chart*) Nos. 1,406 and 1,872. 2 P2 SO 11886"], [630, "[Chap.

E. 11 miles from Ostende lighthouse ; none are dangerous, and they are only mentioned here as they may be crossed by vessels coming out of the Zuydcoote pass and are useful in assuring such that they are in a good and safe track. The COAST.\u2014 The sand-hills forming the. coast between Calais and Gravelines may be seen in clear weather at 8 or 9 miles, but some parts are so low that embankments are thrown up as a protection against the sea. The only objects that can be recognised on the level land adjoining the shore are, the two windmills at Walde, Oye church spire, the two windmills near Oye village, and the telegraph beacons at the Huttes d'Oye. At low water, the sandy strand extends a mile from the shore between Calais and the meridian of Walde windmills, as well as off the entrance to Gravelines ; but, along the intermediate coast, its breadth varies from 5 to 8 cables. Depths of less than 4 fathoms adjoining the beach, extend nearly 2 miles from the shore N.N.E. of Calais church and abreast of Gravelines, and about a mile from the shore between Walde and Oye windmills ; between the outer edge of these soundings and high water mark, the slope of the bottom is steep and somewhat irregular, which tends to cause a heavy sea with on-shore winds. WALDE LIGHT.\u2014 Near the outer edge of the sandy strand which dries at low water, springs, 8 cables from the shore at Walde point, and 3 miles E.N.E. from Calais lighthouse, is an iron hexagonal beacon 59 feet high, from which, at 36 feet above high water, is exhibited a light, visible 11 miles, showing ivhite and red alternately during tiventy seconds, the red flash lasting six seco?ids, the white flash fourteen seconds, with no eclipse between. Telegraph cable.\u2014 The telegraph cable between France and Denmark (from Calais to Fano island), leaves the shore near the Huttes d'Oye, in long. 2\u00b0 2^' E., and lies in a N. \\ E. direction for U miles to lat. 51\u00b0 7' 10\" N., long. 1\u00b0 59' 39\" E, at which point it takes the direction of N.E. \u00a7 N., passing close westward of No. 7 Outer Ruytingen buoy. The first of these directions is indicated by the two beacons on the shore before mentioned, each of which is surmounted by a hexagonal prism, partly white and partly red. Vessels should not anchor on or near the direction indicated by these beacons. Se,: charts, Nos. 1,406 and 1,8 '2,"], [631, "Chap.

GRAVELINES.\u2014 The entrance to this small tidal harbour lies 10 miles eastward of Calais, and its position may be easily recognised bjT the houses of Fort Phillippe village, built close to the sea on each side of the entrance channel, by a windmill about a quarter of a mile eastward of the village, and by the fine tower of the lighthouse. The port itself is under the ramparts of the north-western part of Gravelines, at the mouth of the river Aa, but about a mile within the coast-line ; from the offing only the towers of the Cathedral are seen, the town being hidden from view by trees. About 200 vessels, of which a fair proportion are steamers, enter the port annually bringing about 25,000 tons of merchandise ; the principal imports being wood, coal, woollen goods, bricks, and cement ; the exports, eggs, fruit, vegetables, &c. Vessels are also fitted out for the herring, cod, and mackerel fisheries. The popula tion of the port is about 8,500. Bar. \u2014 Depths. \u2014 The entrance to the channel leading into Grave lines harbour is frequently obstructed by a bar formed of the sand driven in by westerly winds and sea. The height and extent of this bar depend both on the duration of these winds and on the body of fresh water running out of the harbour. At its medium state, it is 5 or 6 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; at such times there are 15 feet over it at high water, springs, and 11 feet at neaps. When the great freshets of the river Aa are accompanied by north easterly winds, it sometimes disappears altogether for several days. The harbour is accessible to vessels of 14 feet draught at high water, springs. At weak springs, those of 1H or 12 feet can enter it during 5 or 6 days, that is to say, for 2 or 3 days before full and change, and 3 days after ; but at the lowest neaps it is only accessible to vessels of about 8 feet draught. It affords good shelter, at springs, to vessels of about 12 feet draught during westerly gales, especially those between W.S.W. and W.N.W., when the sea is not heavy at the entrance ; but, the bar should be crossed at about high water. See chart, No. 1,872."], [632, "[Chap. XII. 604 TAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. In a gale from E.N.E. or East, vessels should run in with the flood, for, after high water, there is some difficulty in stemming the ebb. The tide rises much higher with strong northerly winds, but, as the sea is then very high at the entrance, no vessel drawing more than 12 feet should attempt to enter, unless embayed and with no possibility of reaching Dunkerque road, which is the only place on this coast where, with strong northerly winds, a vessel may find a partially sheltered anchorage. The Entrance Channel runs S. by E. f E. 2 miles in almost a direct line from the pier-heads and consists of two distinct parts, one bounded by the piers; the other, by the land from Fort Phillippe village to Gravelines. The outer part of the channel, 8 cables long and 305 feet wide at the entrance, is enclosed between two stone piers, their outer part terminated by about 330 yards of woodwork to the pier-heads. Abreast of the pier-heads, the level of the fresh water of the river when the tide is out, is 3 feet above the level of the lowest tides. The deepest water in the entrance channel is nearest to the East pier ; on the western side the sand dries alongside the West pier 7 or 8 feet at low water. The inner part of the channel, between Fort Phillippe and Gravelines, is rather more than a mile long and half a cable wide, and is enclosed between embankments which serve for towing paths. The channel has a steep slope on either side, forming good grounding berths for the numerous fishing craft which frequent this part of the harbour. In the summer, the depth is maintained by scouring waters released by sluices from the fosses of the fortifications ; but, at other seasons, the abundant freshets of the river Aa caused by rain and by the melting of the snow, clear both harbour and entrance channel, as previously mentioned. The Tidal harbour is on the north-western side of the town, and is only about 1^ cables long, occupying half the breadth of the channel by which the course of the Aa has been straightened between the ditches of the western part of the fortifications and the entrance channel. There is a small gridiron and careening place in this harbour where vessels of 150 or 200 tons can be received. The berths of muddy sand, alongside the stone or wooden quays See chart.

The swell from outside never reaches the tidal harbour. The Wet dock, or Bassin-a-flot, is 1,083 feet long by 147 feet wide ; it is entered from the tidal harbour by dock gates 32| feet wide, and it again communicates with the river Aa, and hence with the inland navigation by other gates. It is also in communication with the railway by means of a siding. The sill at the entrance is on the level of low water, springs ; at high water, springs, there are 18 feet water, and at ordinary neaps, 15 feet over it. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station close to the light house ; see page 12. LIGHTS.\u2014 Gravelines lighthouse, a white circular tower, stands at the Eastern side of the entrance near the inner end of the East pier. It exhibits, at 95 feet above high water, a fixed light' visible 15 miles within the following limits, viz. : \u2014 white between S. 29\u00b0 W. and S. 36\u00b0 W. ; red between S. 36\u00b0 W. and S. 43\u00b0 W. The red illuminating power is only about half that of the white. West pier. \u2014 A fixed green tidal light, visible 4 miles, is exhibited from iron supports above a shed on the West pier-head ; this light is 25 feet above high water and is shown from two hours before to tivo hours after high water. East pier. \u2014 A fixed red light, visible 4 miles, is shown from a similar structure on the East pier-head ; this light is exhibited all night, and is also 25 feet above high water. Tide signals. \u2014 The usual day tide signals, see page 12, are in use at this port. Tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Gravelines harbour at noon, springs rise 21 feet, neaps 17 feet above the zero of soundings. A deduction of 5 feet from these heights gives the depth on the bar when in its medium state. The tide rises very slowly in the first 3 hours of the flood, but rapidly between the third and fourth hours. High water slack lasts from 10 to 25 minutes in the harbour, but there is very little change for about 1\\ hours at and near high water. Strong winds from N.W. to N.N.W. cause the tide to rise higher, and those from S.E. have a contrary effect. See chart, No. 1,872."], [634, "[Chap. XII. 606 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. Off the pier-heads the East-going stream is at its greatest strength, about 3 knots, at the time of high water in the harbour. Pilots. \u2014 Eight pilots are stationed at Gravelines ; when the sea is too high on the bar for them to board vessels in the offing, they go as far as they can and wave a flag to indicate the direction to be steered ; in such cases, however, it is most dangerous to attempt the entrance. A Life-boat is stationed at Gravelines. Directions. \u2014 Vessels arriving off Gravelines some time before the tide serves, may anchor northward of Oye church spire (being careful to avoid the telegraph cable mentioned at page 602), at 1\\ or 2 miles from the shore, in from 5 to 8 fathoms, excellent holding ground ; this anchorage, however, is only safe during fine weather, for the sea is heavy with on-shore winds. The most favourable winds for entering the harbour are those from N.N.W. to N.E., but, if fresh, they cause a high sea at the entrance, and it is then necessary to be quite certain there is sufficient water over the bar to avoid striking. With fresh winds from W.S.W. to W.N.W., the sea is smooth on the bar, but care is requisite or the east-going stream and sea may drift a vessel on the East pier. The entrance is easy with north-easterly winds when sufficiently strong for a vessel to stem the stream. With a head wind, a vessel must be tracked in. The best time for entering is about an hour before high water, although the stream at that time runs strongly across the entrance and there is some difficulty in keeping in the deepest water ; but, if the vessel takes the ground off Fort Phillippe, with a rising tide, she will float again before high water and get up to Gravelines. Bower and stern anchors must be ready to let go, and hawsers to run out, should she be drifted on the East pier. Sufficient sail should always be carried to ensure good steerage, especially during the autumn and winter months when it often blows fresh in the offing whilst the breeze is light near the shore ; vessels, therefore, under suitable sail in the offing, must be prepared to make more sail as they approach the harbour or they may be in considerable danger in the heavy swell on the bar. In entering the channel with westerly winds, whatever their strength, or with light easterly winds, keep close past the West pier-head. With fresh easterly winds, run directly for the middle of the entrance. See chart, No. 1,872."], [635, "Chap.

The only high lands visible in clear weather are, the Great and Little Cassel, two isolated hills S. i W. from Dunkerque. The town of Cassel stands on the summit of the Great Cassel ; the other hill is of a conical form. The buildings recognisable near the coast are, the tower and light house at Dunkerque, and the church towers of Grande and Petite Synth e and of Mardick. Gravelines point.\u2014 Beacon. \u2014 This point bears East, southerly, 4 miles from Gravelines pier-heads, is of a rounded form, and the sand-hills composing it lie in several parallel ridges and are visible in clear weather 9 or 10 miles ; at its outer extreme is a large wooden beacon. A chain of sand-hills covered with verdure extends 2 miles in a W.S.W. direction from the point, and those bordering the shore for about 2 miles eastward are about the same height as those at the point, but, beyond this, and to within a short distance of Dunkerque, they are covered with bent grass and lie in parallel ridges half a mile in the rear of an embankment, fronted by a low strand which covers at high water, springs. Between the entrance of Gravelines and Gravelines point, the sands dry more than 5 cables out from the beach, at springs ; abreast of the point, they dry 3 cables ; and, between the point and Dunkerque, 6 or 8 cables. The sand carried eastward by strong westerly winds, is arrested by the jetties at Dunkerque and accumulates between Mardick and Dunkerque, where it forms an immense heap of which the highest parts barely cover at springs. Of all the obstacles to the improvement and deepening of Dunkerque, this high bank of drifting sand has always proved the most difficult to combat. Beacons. \u2014 Besides the beacon on Gravelines point, several wooden beacons are placed along the shore between Gravelines and Dunkerque ; they are used in fixing the positions of the most important buoys marking Dunkerque banks. About one mile west ward of Gravelines point are the Gravelines beacons, one on the shore, the other about 4 cables to the northward at low water mark. The Mardick beacon, surmounted by a cone and ball, stands on the Set chart, No. 1,872."], [636, "[Chap. XII. 608 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. sand-hills between Gravelines point and Mardick church. Four other beacons of lesser size occupy positions on the sands between high and low water mark between Gravelines point and Dunkerque. Mardick bank, Fosse de Mardick, &c\u2014 The soundings off this part of the coast, within a depth of 5 fathoms, are very irregular and the sea heavy with on-shore winds. Between the entrance to Gravelines and Gravelines point, these soundings extend in places 2 miles and upwards from the shore ; and, on these shallows, the Mardick bank, with a general width of 5 or 6 cables and from 7 to 18 feet water, extends 3| miles parallel with the shore, its western end joining the shore sands about one mile eastward of Gravelines piers. Another shoal, of which the outer edge is steep-to, joins the strand between Mardick and Dunkerque, and, extending H miles from the shore, forms, with the Mardick bank, the southern side of the West pass ; its western end in 3 fathoms is 6 cables east ward of the eastern end of the Mardick bank, and bears N. by W. \\ W. from Mardick church tower. In-shore of this and of the Mardick bank, is the Fosse de Mardick, which has from 19 to 24 feet water, but should always be avoided as each end terminates in a blind channel. WEST PASS into DUNKERQUE ROAD.*\u2014 Buoyage \u2014 From No. 1 light-buoy, marking the western extreme of the Snouw bank, described at page 596, to abreast of Dunkerque jetty-heads, this pass is 7 miles long, and it lies between the shoal flats joining the shore and the Snouw and Braek banks. The entrance to it is marked by the Dyck and Snouw light-vessels, and its limits as well as the direction it follows, by seven buoys on each side of the channel, black on the northern side, red on the southern. The black buoys bear odd numbers from 1 to 13, the red buoys even numbers from 2 to 14 ; the numbers commencing from the westward. Of the black buoys on the northern side, Nos. 1, 5, 9, and 13 are light-buoys showing red fixed lights; Nos. 3, 7, and 11 are conical with cylinder top-marks. Of the red buoys marking the southern side, placed near the edge of the Mardick bank, and of the shoal bank extending from the shore, Nos. 2, 6, 10, and 14 are light-buoys, 2 and 14 each showing a fixed- white light, whilst 6 and 10 show fixed green lights. Nos. 4, 8, and 12 are conical buoys, each having a cone point downwards for top-mark. * See Admiralty plan : \u2014 Dunkerque road, No. 1,352 ; scale, m = 4'2 inches."], [637, "Chap.

Of the red buoys, Nos. 2, 4, and 6 are conical, each with a cone point upwards as top-mark ; No. 8 is a light-buoy showing a fixed red light ; Nos. 2 and 4 mark the eastern end of Hills bank in the Zuydcoote pass ; Nos. 6 and 8 the southern side of Hills bank ; the latter is a good mark for Dunkerque road. No. 1 is a black spindle buoy surmounted by a cylinder, and marks the north-western edge of the Traepegeer at the entrance to the Zuydcoote pass ; from it, No. 2 red buoy bears about W. by S. \\ S. 1^ miles. The other black buoy, conical, lies If miles eastward of No. 1, and is not numbered ; it marks the northern edge of the Traepegeer in the approach to the pass. LIGHTS. \u2014 Life-boat. \u2014 A small fixed red light, visible 2\\ miles, is shown from a pole on the shore at Braye-dunes, near Zuydcoote, about 6 miles eastward of the entrance to Dunkerque, and 1| miles south-eastward of No. 4 buoy. About 3 miles farther eastward, at La Panne, is a green light, visible 5 miles, and a life-boat station. Caution. \u2014 The red buoys on the eastern slope of Hills bank, which is very steep, have sometimes drifted across the Zuydcoote pass to the western slope of the Traepegeer ; this has frequently happened to No. 4 red buoy. Mariners should therefore be on their guard, though the greatest care is taken to keep the buoyage of both passes in proper condition, a Government steamer being specially assigned for that duty. Directions. \u2014 The general direction through the Zuydcoote pass from the eastward is about S.W. \\ W., with No. 4 red buoy on the port bow until past No. 2 red buoy, when No. 4 should be brought gradually on the starboard bow ; this leads through in the deepest water. When the east-going stream begins to be felt in Dunkerque road, which is about the time of half flood in the harbour, the tide has risen 9 feet in the Zuydcoote pass, and the largest vessels that can enter Dunkerque may at that time pass over the south- Set plan, No. 1,352, and chart, No. 1,872."], [638, "610 [Chap.

If a vessel's draught permits of turning through the Zuydcoote pass between half flood and half ebb, the lead must be hove quickly to avoid coming suddenly upon Hills bank ; and, in standing east ward, she should not open the spires of Bergues more than 2\u00b0 eastward of Leffrinckoucke church tower. At night, when doubtful of the colour of the first buoy seen, small vessels entering by this pass cannot do wrong in passing close eastward of it ; for, if it should be No. 1 black, buoy of the Traepegeer, there is enough water for them for 4 cables eastward of it, and if it should be No. 2 red buoy of the Hills bank, by keeping eastward of it they will be in the middle of the pass. DUNKERQUE ROAD being narrow, and only sheltered by banks of which the greater part are always covered, should be used only as a temporary anchorage by merchant vessels intending to enter the harbour. In heavy weather, sharp vessels deeply laden might be in some danger from the sea, but, with this exception, pilots consider that a vessel with good ground tackle may ride out a gale from the offing ; and, in the winter of 1870-71, a French squadron remained for many months in the road and reported favourably of it ; the banks, even at high water, affording sufficient shelter for large ships. The road is comprised between the 5-fathoms line in-shore, and the Braek, Hills, and Traepegeer banks, on the off-shore side. It extends from the western end of the shallow flat of the Braek, north-eastward of Mardick church, to the entrance of the Zuydcoote pass. The Great or western road, with from 8 to 9 fathoms, good holding-ground, commences N.E. of Mardick church and extends rather beyond the line of Nos. 13 and 14 buoys to about a position from which Dunkerque lighthouse bears S.E. by S. ; it is in some degree sheltered during northerly gales by the high flat on the Braek bank. It is in this part of the road that vessels of deep draught anchor, with westerly winds and a heavy sea, when they have to wait for high water to enter Dunkerque.

The Little or eastern road commences with Leuguenaert tower on with Dunkerque lighthouse, and extends to the Zuydcoote pass ; the depths vary from 8 to 11 fathoms, and the holding-ground is good, especially N.N.E. of Dunkerque. Large vessels remaining some time in the Little road should anchor between the lines of Leuguenaert tower touching the eastern side of the lighthouse, and the same tower on with Dunkerque tower ; here, during gales from N.N.W. to E.N.E., they are better sheltered than in the Great road by the high flats on Braek and Hills banks ; and, in the event of parting, it is much less dangerous to run ashore eastward than westward of Dunkerque. In any part of the road, vessels should have a spare anchor ready if the wind veers and threatens to blow hard from the northward. Tidal Streams. \u2014 The tidal streams turn at about half tide ; the first of the flood or east-going stream in Dunkerque road runs about S.S.E. ; as it gains strength it turns more eastward, and, at its greatest speed, 3^ knots, which lasts about two hours, it runs straight through the road. Its strength then decreases rapidly, and, after a few minutes slack water, the ebb or west-going stream commences, running N.N.W. at first, and, as its rate increases, turning westward, and running parallel with the shore when at its greatest strength ; towards the end of the tide, its direction is W.S.W. and S.S.W. The east-going stream runs for 2$ or 3 hours after high water in the harbour ; see tides, page 616. DUNKERQUE, 10 miles eastward of Gravelines, formerly an arsenal and naval port, is now the principal French commercial port in the North Sea. The town stands at the junction of the Bergues, Bourbourg, and Furnes canals, and the public buildings are spacious, handsome, and regular. As this port is one principal outlet for the great manufacturing Departement du Nord, the trade by sea is very large. Cod and herring fisheries are also carried on with great activity. In 1893, the trade of the port was represented by the entry of 2,888 vessels, their aggregate tonnage being 1,526,442 tons ; of this tonnage, considerably more than one half, and nearly one half in number of the shipping, was British. The number of sailing vessels using this port gradually decreases and the steamers increase. The population in 1891 amounted to 40,513. Set plau, No. 1,352,"], [640, "612 DUNKERQUE ROAD AND PORT. [Chap. XII. There is a town hospital at which foreign sailors are received at two francs per diem ; cases of small-pox or typhoid are sent to the Lazaret, where the charges are much higher. There is also a Sailor's Home and British Seamen's Institute. A British Consul is stationed at Dunkerque. The principal imports are, ores, coal, cereals, seeds, molasses, nitrate of soda, wood, wool, flax, petroleum, jute, and pig iron. The exports are coal, forage, potash, rails, and casks. Dunkerque is in railway communication with all parts of France and the Continent, and through Furnes with Belgium. The telegraph service is also very good. By sea, there is regular steam service to London, Hull, Goole, Leith, Rotterdam, St. Petersburg, Havre, Bordeaux, and Marseilles. Coal is always plentiful and moderate in price, that of French coal delivered on board being about 14s. per ton. Vessels usually coal in the Basins ; if they coal alongside the wharf in the tidal harbour, they lie aground in about 8i feet at low water. The port consists of an entrance channel leading in to the tidal harbour, of four wet docks or basins, and of four dry docks of which two only are completed. There are also building yards where fishing craft of from 30 to 150 tons are built, and also vessels up to 800 tons for the foreign and coasting trade. Great improvements have been effected in the entrance and tidal harbours of late years by dredging and otherwise, and extensive works are still (1896) in progress, of which, perhaps, the most important is the widening of the entrance channel to nearly double its present width by the construction of a new East pier, now in a forward state, to be followed by the removal of the old pier, the site of which will, in fact, become about the centre of the channel. Entrance. \u2014 Depths. \u2014 The entrance channel is about one mile long N.N.W. and S.S.E., and at present only 230 feet wide ; it is enclosed partly by the citadel quay and the extension of the town quay as far as the Cunette sluice, and partly between wooden jetties extending across the sands which uncover at low water. As far up as the North lock entrance to the Bassin Freycinet, it is dredged and maintained at a uniform depth of 9| feet below the zero of soundings, which is 2-\\ feet lower than low water of ordinary spring tides ; therefore at high water, springs, there are 28| scut in the See plan, No. 1,352."], [641, "Chap.

Water from the canals of the interior and from the ditches of the town, is used to scour the harbour and entrance channel, but, although the stream is rapid, it has so far to run that its effect does not extend much beyond the jetty-heads, and constant steam dredging in conjunction with flushing is necessary to keep the entrance clear. Northerly gales cause such a high sea outside the jetties that vessels above 18 feet draught should not attempt to run in at such times unless the pilots judge the entrance practicable ; smaller vessels may enter at the top of high water by carrying all possible sail to get through the heavy sea, and, at neaps, the entrance is inacessible during these gales to all but small vessels. During rainy weather, and at the melting of the snow, when the water in the interior is abundant, the stream runs strongly out of the channel so long as the flood is weak, and is checked only when the tide rises rapidly ; it recovers its outward direction when the rise of tide slacks, about half an hour before high water, and as soon as the tide begins to fall it runs out with great strength. The stream causes very little inconvenience to sailing vessels of deep draught entering before high water, but, as soon as the tide begins to fall, they must have a strong fair wind to get through against it. Tidal harbour. \u2014 From abreast the entrance of the new North lock to the head of the tidal harbour, the distance is about 6| cables, and the width from 200 to 500 feet ; it is surrounded by quays where several lines of steamers have their regular berths. As far as the North lock entrance to the Bassin Freycinet, there is a central depth of 9| feet, but in the upper part only from 3 to 5 feet, with H to 2 feet alongside the quays. At the quai de l'Estran, and also at the quai de Maree, on the western side of the entrance to the Bassin Freycinet, the depth is 6^ feet. Strong northerly winds cause the swell to enter the tidal harbour for about 2 or 3 hours each tide, but it does not inconvenience a vessel well secured. Wet docks. \u2014 The four wet docks or bassins-a-flot are named respectively, the Bassin Freycinet, du Commerce, de la Marine, and de l'Arriere Port. The Bassin Freycinet has been greatly enlarged of late years, having an area of about 67 acres ; it is entered by the new North lock and also by the East lock, and admits merchant vessels of the See plan, No. 1,352,"], [642, "614 [Chap.

Three moles extending from its western side divide it into four open compartments, named respectively Bassins Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 ; these moles afford large quayage accommodation with railways and ample facilities for loading and discharging cargo. The northern half of the Bassin Freycinet, including the compartments 3 and 4, is dredged to a depth of 14^ feet below the zero of soundings ; the southern half, including Nos. 1 and 2, has 6^ feet less water. The two halves are divided by lock gates, over which trains can pass. The North lock communicates directly with the northern division and the East lock with the southern division of the Bassin Frey cinet ; the North lock is 582 feet long, 69 feet wide, and has 35j feet over the sill at high water, springs. The East lock is 394 feet long, G6 feet wide, and has 23| feet over the sill at high water, springs. The Bassin Freycinet has communication also with the Bassin de la Marine, and also by two locks with the general canal system of the country. The Bassin du Commerce, of 13i acres area, communicates with the Tidal harbour, and also with the Bassins de la Marine and de l'Arriere Port. It has good stone quays on both sides. The Bassin de la Marine, of l-\\ acres area, is surrounded by quays, and the Bassin de l'Arriere Port, of 6 acres, has a wooden quay on its western side, and communicates with the canal system. The depth over the sills of the Bassin du Commerce, de la Marine, and de l'Arriere Port, is in each case about 20 feet 9 inches at high water, springs ; and the length of the entrances 1 64 feet. The width of entrance to the first is 52^ feet, and of the others only 43 feet. Dry docks. \u2014 Of the four dry docks, Nos. 1 and 2 are completed and in use, each is 393| feet in length over all, by 46 feet width of entrance, but No. 2 has about 24| feet over the sill at high water, springs, whilst No. 1 has only 20 feet. Nos. 3 and 4 docks are nearly completed ; their dimensions are : \u2014 No. 3, 295^ feet length over all, 46 feet width of entrance, and about 20 feet over the sill at high water, springs. No. 4, 656 feet length over all, 69 feet width of entrance, and about 24^ feet over the sill at high water, springs. All the dry docks are entered from the Bassin Freycinet.

LIGHTS\u2014 Dunkerque lighthouse, a yellow brick tower 187 feet high, stands S. 17\u00b0 E. 875 yards from the entrance, between the sluice and the ruins of Fort Risban. It exhibits, at 193 feet above high water, a group-flashing white electric light, visible 20 miles, showing successive groups of two flashes each, the flashes are each of three fourths of a second duration, the interval between them one and a half seconds, the interval between the groups four and a half seconds. Leuguenaert or Hueguenar\u2014 A fixed ivhite light of the fifth order, and 85 feet above high water, is exhibited from the Leugue naert tower, an octagonal stone tower S.S.E. 2,406 yards from the entrance. This light, specially intended to indicate the direction of the entrance channel, shows brightest in the direction of N.N.W., and on that bearing is visible 15 miles. Right or left of this direc tion, the light is visible only within an angular space of 10\u00b0 or 12\u00b0, and from a distance of 5 or 6 miles. East Jetty-head. \u2014 A fixed red- light, visible 4 miles, is shown from an iron post and shed at the East jetty-head, at 26 feet above high water. Tidal light. \u2014 West jetty. \u2014 From a white tower 49 feet within the West jetty-head, at 33 feet above the sea, is exhibited a tidal light, visible 9 miles, varying in colour, and indicating by colour and flashes the state of the tide, so long as it is 65 feet above the zero of soundings, at which time there are 16^ feet in the entrance channel. Every 10 inches of rise above that level is shown, thus : \u2014 When the tide is less than 6\\ feet above zero, i.e. the depth of the lowest tide known, and rising, the light shows red ; when less than 6k feet and falling, the light shows green. A fixed ivhite light indicates depths from 6^- and 1\\ feet. With 1\\ feet and upwards, the light shows white with groups of coloured flashes at intervals of eighty seconds. The flashes in each group are shown at intervals of five seconds, each red flash adding 3 feet 4 inches to the initial height of 6\\ feet, and each green flash 10 inches more. With a rising tide, the fixed light of each colour is eclipsed for a short period every eighty seconds ; and, with a falling tide twice in quick succession during the same period. At or near high water no eclipse takes place. See plan. No. 1,352. 2Q SO 11886"], [644, "[Chap. XII. 616 DUNKERQUE ROAD AND PORT. Fog signal. \u2014 In thick or foggy weather, a large bell at the West jetty-head is rung for one minute at intervals of one minute, and continuously in answer to fog signals from an approaching vessel ; see Fog signals, page 11. Tide signals. \u2014 The day tide signals are those in use at all French ports, see page 12. They are made from a flagstaff a little within the lighthouse on the West jetty. Tides.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Dunkerque, at Oh. 13m. ; springs rise 19 feet, neaps 15f feet above the level of the lowest tides or zero of soundings, which is about 2\\ feet below the level of low water, ordinary springs ; and 9| feet added to the rise gives about the average depth at high water throughout the entrance channel. Strong northerly winds may raise the tide 2 or 3 feet higher, but the sea is then heavy at the entrance. When easterly winds prevail, springs do not rise much higher than do neaps with fresh westerly winds. In the harbour, in calm weather, high water slack lasts about 15 minutes ; with westerly winds, 20 or 25 minutes ; and, with off-shore winds, 10 minutes. A short distance outside the jetties, the flood or eastern stream runs 2f or 3 hours after high water in the harbour. Semaphore. \u2014 There is a Semaphore station at Dunkerque ; it is just in front of the principal lighthouse ; see page 12. . Pilots are unable to get out of harbour when there is a heavy sea at the entrance, which is frequently the case ; but, three pilot vessels are always cruising at sea. Their stations are, one between Dunge ness and the Downs, another near the Ruytingen light-vessel, and a third near the Dyck light-vessel. They all have Dunkerque in large black letters on the mainsail and a large black anchor beneath that name. They always endeavour to meet large vessels, but small ones requiring a pilot should make the signal directly they sight a pilot vessel. Steam-tugS. \u2014 The port is well supplied with steam-tugs, whose services are always available. A Life-boat is stationed at Dunkerque.

From thence, the course to the Dyck light-vessel, at the entrance of the West Pass into Dunkerque road, is E. i S. 14 miles ; this leads about 8 cables northward of the red perch and globe buoy marking the eastern end of the Riden de Calais. In approaching the West Pass, the Dyck and Snouw light-vessels in line E. f S. affords a good lead so long as the latter remains in position, but, as previously remarked, notice has been given of the intention permanently to remove her. Pass northward of the Dyck light-vessel, and southward of the black light-buoy at the western end of the Snouw bank, and of the Snouw light-vessel, and run in, leaving all black buoys on the port hand and red buoys on the star board hand up to Dunkerque Great road ; but if proceeding eastward beyond the entrance of the harbour to the Little road, it must be borne in mind that the colour of the buoys is reversed, red buoys marking that road on the port hand, if coming from the westward. Vessels of deep draught running in with a strong westerly wind, at low water, should avoid the 21-f eet spit which extends 5 cables west ward of No. 9 black buoy, by keeping over towards No. 10 red buoy in this part of the Pass. Large vessels, having to wait for high water to enter Dunkerque, anchor in the Pass between Nos. 11 and 13 black buoys. With the wind between N.N.E. and E.N.E., long boards should be made in the Pas de Calais until Calais bears S.S.E. \\ E., when a vessel should stand in for the land, keeping the lead going quickly to avoid crossing the Riden de Calais. Boards of about 3 miles may be made between the West Dyck and the 5-fathoms edge of soundings towards the shore, but, from the meridian of Gravelines lighthouse to the entrance of the West Pass, short tacks should be made near the edge of these soundings, bearings of the Dyck and Snouw light vessels enabling this to be done with great confidence. At night, with westerly winds, after running past cape Grisnez as directed, until Calais light bears S.E. \\ S. and cape Grisnez light S.W. \\ W., steer E. \\ S. for the Dyck light-vessel ; the Snouw light vessel will be sighted shortly after the Dyck, then steer for them in line bearing E. \u00a7 S., and, passing them as described by day, run on through Dunkerque road, anchoring in about 8 fathoms, with Leu guenaert tower light seen between the two jetty lights S.S.E.

DUNKERQUE ROAD AND PORT. 618 From the Northward. \u2014 When bound from the North sea to Dunkerque, or other French ports on this coast, endeavour to make the land about cape Blanc-Nez whatever the direction of wind or time or tide. The land south-westward of this cape, as far as cape Grisnez, may be seen in ordinary weather about 18 miles, and Mont Couple and the hills around it, 22 or 23 miles. The course from about 3 or 4 miles eastward of the Galloper light- vessel is S.S.W. |W.; this leads eastward of the Four-mile knolls or North Falls Head, and when the North Foreland lighthouse bears W. by N. \\ N., steer about S.W. \\ S. to pass midway between the Falls Tail and the south western end of the Sandettie bank. In clear weather, there is no difficulty in turning to windward over this ground ; when thick or foggy, the lead must be kept going quickly to avoid standing into less than 20 fathoms. From a well-defined position, ships may pass between the Great and Little banks of the Outer Ruytingen by steering for Gravelines light house bearing S.S.E., and taking great care to maintain that bearing ; the least water in this route is '6\\ fathoms, on crossing the West Dyck bank. On bringing the Dyck and Snouw light-vessels in line, proceed as before directed for Dunkerque roads. At night, the lights at the South Foreland, cape Grisnez, Calais, and even Dunkerque, may be seen in clear weather when a vessel is midway between the Falls Tail and the south-western end of the Sandettie ; from this position, if the wind is from the eastward, Calais light may be steered for, bearing South, or, if from the west ward, the land between Calais and cape Grisnez ; but, to keep a safe distance from the shores on either of these courses, it is necessary in the former case not to bring cape Grisnez light westward of S.W. by W. ; and, in the latter, not to bring cape Grisnez light westward of S.W. \\ W., nor Calais light eastward of S.E. by S. Having attained either of the positions indicated by these bearings, the Dyck light-vessel and Dunkerque road may be steered for as before directed from the westward. With strong northerly winds, it is not prudent to approach within 5 miles of the shore. With strong north-westerly winds, vessels sometimes pass west ward of the Galloper and the Falls, or between the Galloper and Four-mile knolls and then westward of the Falls, in order to get iS '\u25a0 chart, No. 1,872, and plan. No. 1,352."], [647, "Chap. XII.] 619 DIRECTIONS. smoother water. The course from about 2 miles westward of the Galloper is S.W. \\ S., and a run of about 34 miles on that course brings the vessel up to the East Goodwin light-vessel and well south ward of the Falls Tail ; both cape Grisnez and Calais lights will then be in sight if the weather is clear. Entering Dunkerque.\u2014 Have good hawsers ready to moor head and stern, anchors clear, and, with a fair wind, a heavy anchor ready to bring up by the stern. If blowing hard from the north-westward, all possible sail should be carried to pass quickly through the breakers at the entrance, and the best time then for running in is at high water. When within the entrance channel there is no difficulty in entering the harbour. Strong winds between N.N.W. and W.S.W. cause a heavy swell at the entrance. At such times, keep close to tne West jetty-head and western side of the channel until sheltered by that part of the jetty which is boarded up, as the east-going stream setting through the open pilework runs with great rapidity towards the East jetty. This stream, as before explained, see page 611, is at its greatest strength about half an hour before high water in the harbour. With moderate westerly winds, the most favourable time to enter is when the stream slackens, or from thirty to forty-five minutes after high water in the harbour. Strong easterly winds against tide also raise a high sea at the entrance ; with these winds, steer for the East jetty-head, and then run along the eastern side of the channel. When it blows hard between S.S.W. and S.S.E., vessels cannot enter under sail and the services of a steam-tug are requisite ; but, if preferred, as the sea is then smooth, they may- remain in the road without danger. During light winds, every effort should be made to close with the West jetty head to avoid being drifted eastward of the entrance by the east-going stream, which is running across the entrance outside the jetties the whole of the time large vessels can enter. The best time for those of light draught to run in is directly there is sufficient water and before the flood has attained much strength. Leaving Dunkerque. \u2014 Sailing vessels bound westward or to the northern ports of the North sea, either wait for favourable winds or are towed out to positions from which to make sail. The gates of the wet docks are opened one hour before and closed about half an See chart, No. 1,872, and plan, No. 1,352."], [648, "[Chap. XII. 620 DUNKERQUE ROAD AND PORT. hour after high water. Winds with southing in them are the most favourable for leaving, but on-shore winds, when strong, forbid all egress. If bound westward, vessels should leave the harbour directly they float if the wind is sufficiently strong to stem the flood stream ; but, with a light wind, they should not start until near the top of high water, and then anchor in the road for the stream to slacken. On quitting the West pass, a W. \u00a3 N. course leads northward of the Riden de Calais ; and, when Calais lighthouse bears S.E. \\ S., or cape Grisnez lighthouse S.W. \\ W., a S.W. by W. \\ W. course leads a safe distance westward of that cape. If bound northward, and the vessel's draught permits her crossing the banks northward of Dunkerque, the entrance channel should be left as early as possible before high water ; but, this passage should never be attempted without a fresh fair wind so as to run quickly over the banks, and it must be borne in mind that there may be 7 or 8 feet less water in crossing the Braek and Smal banks than in the entrance channel. When clear of the jetties, steer to the north westward to bring the spire at Petite Synthe on with the guard-house about a mile westward of Dunkerque lighthouse S.W. by S. ; then run out N.E. by N. with this mark on, crossing in succession the Braek, Smal, and East Breedt banks, until the lead shows that the vessel is near the eastern edge of the East Dyck bank, when a N.E. by E. course for 35 miles leads between Thornton ridge and Bligh bank. The soundings on this latter course are from 14 to 19 fathoms. A cast of 9 or 10 fathoms may be had on the two narrow shoals between Thornton ridge and Bligh bank. If the vessel's draught does not permit of her crossing these banks, leave the harbour as sdon as she floats so as to get the full benefit of the east-going stream, and, when outside the jetties, steer through the Zuydcoote pass ; see page 609. When clear of the Pass, steer E.N.E. through the West deep until Furnes is on with Brours Duin, bearing South, when the vessel will be crossing the narrow shoal joining the Smal and Nieuport banks. From thence, a N.E. \\ N. course for 35 miles leads through the North channel and clear of all the banks. The only inconvenience in following this course is, the crossing of the tidal stream, running about 2 knots, in an oblique direction, which must be allowed for. Ostende light may be seen in ordinary weather until within 2 miles of the southern part of Thornton ridge. See chart, No. 1,872."], [649, "Chap. XII.] DIRECTIONS. \u2014 COAST. \u2014 TIDAL STREAMS. 621 THE COAST.\u2014 From Dunkerque to the frontier of Belgium. 7 miles distant, and for 25 smiles beyond it as far as Blankenberg, the coast trends nearly in a straight line E. by N. \\ N. The shore being low, sandy, and by sand-hills, has a dull uniform appearance, the only objects that can be recognised on the level plain in the interior being the clumps of trees surrounding villages, church-towers, and windmills. Between Dunkerque and the frontier a large beacon named the Pilot's mast, and some revenue guard houses, may be seen on the sand-hills near the shore, and the old ruined tower, known as Sables tower, amongst the sand-hills near Zuydcoote ; and, beyond the frontier, the towers of Furnes, the ramparts and church tower of Nieuport, and, bearing North from Furnes, is Brours Duin, a high white sand-hill, flattened at the summit, and easily recognised at sea by its being entirely free from verdure, whilst those near it are of a brown colour and covered with bent grass. The sandy strand bordering the coast abreast of Dunkerque Little road, dries out 3 or 4 cables at low water, and the depth outside it increases gradually to 4i fathoms at a mile from the shore. To ground in bad weather on this part of the coast on a falling tide is less fatal than on the beach between Dunkerque and Mardick ; for, whatever the violence of wind and surf, if a vessel runs stem on to the beach she makes a bed in the sand and the crew may all be saved if they stay on board until the tide leaves her, which it soon does if she takes the ground about half an hour after high water ; whereas a vessel grounding on the high beach westward of Dunkerque, almost always becomes a total wreck, often with loss of crew, at whatever time of tide she runs ashore. TIDES AND TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 On the northern coast of France, as well as on the English shore from Dover to the North Foreland, the tide, at springs, rises for 5|- hours, and falls for 1\\ hours ; but these times vary according to the moon's age ; that of the flood or rising tide increasing progressively from full or change to the following quarter, whilst that of the ebb, or falling tide, decreases ; so that two or three days after the quarter, the duration of flood and ebb are alike. The duration of the ebb then increases gradually until the following full or change, and that of the flood decreases. In calm weather, both streams in the offing have respectively about the same duration as the rising and falling tide on the shore, and See chart, No. 1,872."], [650, "[Chap. XII. 622 CAPE GRISNEZ TO DUNKERQUE. their rate is in proportion to the range of tide ; the times of the change of stream, however, do not coincide with the times of high and low water by the shore. The flood or east-going stream is generally\" less rapid than the west-going stream, but the rate and duration of both are influenced by the winds. It has not yet been ascertained by any decisive experiments whether the range of the tides between the northern coast of France and the estuary of the Thames is equal to that observed on the surrounding shores. All that is positively known on the subject is, that as far as 15 or 16 miles from the French coast, the vertical motion of the tides seems to follow very nearly the same law as on the shore ; they take place at the same times and appear to rise in an equal degree ; but, if the rise, at springs, on this coast, at Calais for example, is compared with that observed at the same tides on the coasts of Holland and Belgium, as well as at several positions in the estuary of the Thames, and especially at Orfordness, it would appear that beyond the distance of 15 or 16 miles from the French coast, in a N.N.E. and E.N.E. direction, the range of tide decreases in the same manner as on the shores. It is even probable that this decrease is very rapid, for, in the middle of the North sea, between Holland and England, there are not more than 2 or 3 feet difference between high and low water ; the mariner, therefore, in determining his position by the depths on the chart, should diminish the allowance required for rise of tide according to his distance from the nearest shore. The tides on the coasts of France, Belgium, and Holland, as well as on the coast of England from Dover to the North Foreland, are chiefly affected by the tidal wave which traverses in about 8 hours the whole extent of the English channel. The flood or east-going stream, when at its greatest strength, takes an E.N.E. direction, which is only changed near the shore by the trend of the coast. The tides on the English coast, northward of the North Foreland are produced by a similar tidal wave, which, after having doubled the northern extreme of the British islands, extends southward along the eastern coasts of Scotland and England and runs directly towards the estuary of the Thames. The flood or southern stream, when at its greatest strength, runs parallel with the English coast, but when it has reached the parallel of Orfordness, and the Thames opens out, it turns to W.S.W. in an opposite direction to that which the flood See chart, No. 1,872."], [651, "623 Chap. XII.] TIDES AND TIDAL STREAMS.\u2014 CAUTION. stream follows near the coast of France. But, as the changes of stream in the offing occur later than near the shore, in proportion to the distance from the land, the stream of flood on the French coast evidently mingles with the ebb stream from the mouth of the Thames, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Gabbard and Galloper banks. CAUTION. \u2014 Mariners should bear in mind that the direction of the tidal stream in the offing, either in the North sea or Channel, is not to be taken as a sign of the rise or fall of the tide ; for, a vessel would be exposed to the greatest danger if she ran with the flood stream towards a shoal lying far from the land, under the idea that in consequence of the direction of the stream the water was rising on that shoal, and that she might venture to cross it. The flood stream only ceases to be felt in the vicinity of some of those banks which are farthest out from the coasts of France and Belgium, when it is nearly low water on the shore. When desirous of crossing a bank lying within 15 or 16 miles of the French coast, an approximate calculation should always be made of the number of feet the tide has risen above the soundings shown on the chart. A useful table (B) for this computation will be found at page 98 of the Admiralty tide tables, published annually. See chart, No. 1,872."], [652, "[Chap.
