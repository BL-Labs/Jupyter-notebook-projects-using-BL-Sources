Green : \u2014 acted 19 times the Duke of Buckingham had been particularly happy in his alteration of Fletcher's Chances \u2014 on this evening it was degraded to an Opera\u2014 the actor of this literary murder was Reynolds. Act 1 \u2014 the names of Antonio and the 2 Constan tias are, from mere caprice, changed to Fractioso and the 2 Violettas. Scene 3 \u2014 when the 1st Violetta has put herself into the hands of Don Frederick, instead of going off immediately (like the 1st Constantia) for fear of being discovered, she with the utmost composure be gins singing in the open street. Scene 4 \u2014 when Don John enters with the Land lady, Reynolds has mutilated the scene sadly, by leaving out the wine, with which Don John plies her before he can get her into good humour \u2014 yet after she is gone, he gives Don John a new speech, in which he observes, that young women may be caught 50 ways, but that old ones must be roused to their sense of feeling by gold or wine. Scene 5 \u2014 after the Duke has been rescued by Don John, his 3 friends enter- he tells them, that their"], [115, "c g. 1820-1821. 105 foes, in increased numbers, surround them \u2014 they do not, however, think of retiring till they have sung a Quartetto.

Sardanapalus \u2014 the scene lies in the royal palace at Nineveh \u2014 Sardanapalus is entirely devoted to pleasure \u2014 Arbaces (a Mede) and Beleses (a Chal d\u00e6an and Soothsayer) conspire against him \u2014 they attack the palace, and force their way into the grand hall \u2014Sardanapalus is roused, and fights with great bravery \u2014 the rebels are appalled by his demeanour, and his friends astonished \u2014 at the conclusion, the rebels are victorious\u2014 Sardanapalus orders a large pile of wood to be raised\u2014 he mounts the pile \u2014 Myrrha sets fire to the pile \u2014 as she springs forward"], [145, "135 LORD BYRON. to throw herself into the flames, the curtain falls- Lord Byron says it has been his intention to follow the account of Diodorus Siculus, but he has repre sented the character of Sardanapalus in a manner very different from the account which Diodorus gives of him \u2014 this is no more than a fair poetical license, and his lordship by deviating from history, has made Sardanapalus a much more interesting personage than he could otherwise have done \u2014 how ever we may despise him for his excessive love of pleasure, &c, yet we must admire him for his dislike of war, this clemency, and even for his personal con duct, when he is compelled to exert his energies \u2014 most of the D.

Two Foscari \u2014 this T. is founded on the history of Venice, from which his lordship gives a long ex tract in his appendix \u2014 Loredano, from an unground ed suspicion that his father and uncle had been poi soned by the elder Foscari, who is Doge of Venice, pursues him and his son with implacable hatred \u2014 as he is one of the leading members of the Council of Ten, he has an opportunity of gratifying his ma lice \u2014 the younger Foscari is put to the rack and banished for life \u2014 he however dies before he leaves Venice \u2014 in the 5th act the Doge is deposed \u2014 he also dies \u2014 Barbarigo requests him to lean on him \u2014 the Doge replies \u2014 \" No ! a sovereign should die \" standing \" \u2014 this was really said by the Emperour Adrian, and Lord Byron has introduced it happily \u2014 the language ofthis T. is very good, and the cha racters are well drawn, but a sameness pervades the piece from want of incident \u2014 the plot was evidently too simple for 5 acts\u2014 at p. 251 Loredano says \u2014 \u2022' the time narrows.\""], [147, "137 LORD BYRON. 3.

There was another impediment to Mr. Charlton's plan\u2014 Mrs. Summers was one of the Annuitants \u2014 a most reluctant consent had been extorted from her by importunities \u2014 when this circumstance came to the knowledge of her real friends, they advised her to withdraw her consent. Thus the matter rested till Oct. 1828, when Mrs."], [549, "BATH THEATRICAL FUND. 539 Summers died\u2014 Mr. Charlton and his friends then resumed their operations\u2014 it was not however till May or June in 1829, that Mr. Dimond received a formal Summons to resign his Trust, in favour of a person who was Mr. Charlton's particular friend\u2014 the Summons was signed by all the Aunuitants and Subscribers \u2014 the 5 Annuitants were William Smith \u2014 Joseph Glassington\u2014 Mrs. B.

It is particularly to be observed, that, in the Sum mons, the Bath Theatrical Fund was not men tioned by its usual and proper name \u2014 it was called the Bath Friendly Society \u2014 this artifice was resorted to, with the hope of annihilating the Theatrical Fund, by the means of some Act of Parliament, which had been passed about Friendly Societies there was this manifest difference between the Thea trical Fund and a mere Friendly Society \u2014 the capital of the Theatrical Fund had been only in a very sub ordinate degree derived from the subscriptions of the existing members\u2014 it had been derived principally from the liberality of others, who had contributed to it, under a full and warranted belief, that in so doing they were contributing to a charitable and permanent institution\u2014 no person knew better than xMr. Charl ton himself, that the Bath Theatrical Fund was not"], [550, "540 BATH THEATRICAL FUND. a mere Friendly Society\u2014 and when he first broached his plan, he grounded the pretensions of himself and his friends on a very different argument. The original Trustees of the Theatrical Fund were the late Mr. Dimond and a gentleman who was banker to the theatre\u2014 on the decease of Mr. Di mond, the Subscribers requested his eldest son to accept the Trust \u2014 the son of the banker was at the same time made a Trustee \u2014 probably with a view to save trouble and expense in case of his father's death. The first petition of Mr. Charlton and his friends to the Court of Chancery, was put off through an informality \u2014 their amended petition had a still worse flaw \u2014 and the Master of the Rolls made a difficulty, in Nov. 1829, even in allowing them to amend their petition once more \u2014 and to place themselves last in the list \u2014 Hilary and Easter terms in 1830 passed over in silence \u2014 in Trinity term M r. Dimond called on Mr. Charlton and his friends to proceed \u2014 their Coun sel said he had no instructions to proceed \u2014 on this the Master of the Rolls dismissed the petition finally \u2014 it is not easy to conjecture why Mr. Charlton and his friends would not proceed \u2014 some of them had re peatedly boasted, that, on the death of Mrs. Sum mers, they could settle matters to their satisfaction, without the consent, of Mr. Dimond. The preservation of the Theatrical Fund is to be attributed solely to the integrity of Mr. Dimond the two other Trustees having yielded their assent to the persevering importunity of the parties interested in the destruction'of the Fund."], [551, "541 JAMES SHIRLEY. Perhaps it is to be regretted that the business of the Fund did not come to a fair hearing before the Master of the Rolls, as the state of the Fund is such, that some interference on the part of the Court of Chancery must ultimately be expedient \u2014 and it is to be hoped, that, at some proper time, an applica tion will be made to that Court\u2014 not for the anni hilation of the Bath Theatrical Fund, but for the better regulation, or re-establishment of it.

Hall, in some verses printed with the Cardinal in 1652, addresses Shirley as the surviving honour and ornament of the English stage \u2014 he concludes with saying \u2014 \" Yet this I dare assert, when men have nam'd \" Jonson (the nation's Laureat,) the fam'd \" Beaumont and Fletcher, he that cannot see \" Shirley, the fourth, must forfeit his best eye.\""], [552, "542 JAMES SHIRLEY.

Nothing is so much wanted in the dramatic line as an edition of Shirley's plays \u2014 an edition was promised to the public in 1815, or perhaps sooner \u2014 - the promise was repeated again and again \u2014 some times in the shape of a formal advertisement, as thus \u2014 \" The Plays and Poems of Shirley, now first col \" lected and chronologically arranged, and the Text \" carefully collated and restored.

The English nation in the time of Shakspeare was yet struggling to emerge from barbarity ; literature was confined to professed scholars, or to men and women of high rank : the public was gross and dark ; and to be able to read and write was an accomplish ment still valued for its rarity. Shakspeare engaged in dramatic poetry with the world open before him ; the rules of the ancients were yet known to few ; the public judgment was uninformed ; he had no example of such fame as might force him upon imitation ; nor critics of such authority as might restrain his extravagance : he therefore indulged his natural disposition \u2014 his plots, whether historical or fabulous, are always crowded VOL. IX- **p"], [588, "578 OLD PLAYS. with incidents, by which the attention of a rude people was more easily caught than by sentiment or argumentation : the show and bustle with which his plays abound have the same original ; he knew how he should most please ; and whether his prac tice is more agreeable to nature, or whether his ex ample has prejudiced the nation, we still find that on our stage something must be done, as well as said, and that inactive declamation is very coldly heard. Shakspeare is above all writers the poet of nature, the poet that holds up to his readers the faithful mirror of manners, and life \u2014 his characters are the genuine progeny of common humanity, such as the world will always supply, and observation will always find ; he has no heroes, his scenes are occupied only by men, who act and speak as the reader thinks he should have spoken and acted on the same occa sion ; even when the agency is supernatural, the dialogue is level with life. The stage, when it is under any other direction, is too often peopled with such characters as were never seen, conversing in a language which was never heard, upon topics which will never arise in the commerce of mankind : but the dialogue of Shakspeare is so evidently determined by the acci dent which produces it, and is pursued with so much ease and simplicity, that it seems scarcely to claim the merit of fiction. In most other Tragedies the grand agent is Love \u2014 to bring a lover, a lady, and a rival, into the fable, to entangle them in contradictory obligations, to make them meet in rapture, and part in agony,"], [589, "579 OLD PLAYS. to fill their mouths with hyperbolical joy and out rageous sorrow, to distress them as nothing human was ever distressed, and to deliver them as nothing human was ever delivered, is the business of a modern dramatist : for this, probability is violated, life is misrepresented and language is depraved \u2014 but love is only one of many passions, and as it has no great influence on the sum of life, it has little operation in the dramas of a poet, who caught his ideas from the living world, and exhibited only what he saw before him. Every man finds his mind more strongly seized by the Tragedies of Shakspeare than those of any other writer : others please us by particular speeches, but he always makes us anxious for the event, and has perhaps excelled all but Homer, in securing the first purpose of a writer, by exciting restless and unquenchable curiosity, and compelling him that reads his work, to read it through. Shakspeare, with his excellencies has likewise faults - in Tragedy he often writes with great ap pearance of toil, what is written at last with little felicity ; but in his comic scenes he seems to pro duce without labour, what no labour can improve : his Comedy pleases by the thoughts and language, his Tragedy, for the greater part by incident and action ; his Tragedy seems to be skill, his Comedy to be instinct. But the admirers of this great poet have most reason to complain, when he approaches nearest to his highest excellence : what he does best he soon ceases to do : he is not long soft and pathetio, p p 2"], [590, "580 OLD PLAYS. without some idle conceit, or contemptible equivo cation : a quibble was to him the fatal Cleopatra, for which he lost the world and was content to lose it. It may be observed that in many of his plays the latter part is evidently neglected : when he found himself near the end of his work, and in view of his reward, he shortened the labour to snatch the profit : he therefore remits his efforts, where he should most vigorously exert them ; and his catastrophe is improperly produced, or imperfectly represented. (Dr. Johnson.) Dr. Johnson says \u2014 \" Notes are often necessary, \" but they are necessary evils \u2014 let him that is yet \" unacquainted with the powers of Shakspeare, and \" who desires to feel the highest pleasure which the \" drama can give, read every play, from the first \" scene to the last, with utter negligence of all his \" commentators : when his fancy is once on the \" wing let him not stoop at correction, or explana \" tion : when his attention is strongly engaged, let \" it disdain alike to turn aside to the name of \" Theobald and of Pope : let him read through \" brightness and obscurity, through integrity and \" corruption ; let him preserve his comprehension \" of the dialogue, and his interest in the fable ; \" and when the pleasures of novelty have ceased, \" let him attempt exactness, and read the com \" mentators.\" Steevens observes there are many passages unex plained and unintelligible, which may be reformed, at hazard of whatever license, for exhibitions on the"], [591, "581 OLD PLAYS. stage, in which the pleasure of the audience is chiefly to be considered ; but which must remain untouched by the critical editor.

Daniel, tho' very rarely sublime in his poetry, has skill in the pathetic, and his pages are not dis graced by pedantry nor conceit ; as he has no ob scurities either of style or language, the oblivion he has met with is peculiarly undeserved.
