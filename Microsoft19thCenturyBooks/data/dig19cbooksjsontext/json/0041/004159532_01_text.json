The County of Sussex, the ancient Kingdom of the South Saxons, lies along the southern coast of Great Britain, the English Channel, and extends in length from Ladyholt Park on the west in a course due east to East Guldeford near Eye, a distance of about 77 miles; and from north to south from Tunbridge Wells to Beachy Head, a distance of 27 miles. The average breadth, however, does not exceed 20 miles. The divisions of the county are strongly marked by nature. They consist chiefly of the great Weald (the ancient Forest of Andred,* or Anderida) and the noble range of chalk hills called the South Downs, interspersed with tracts of alluvium and other formations. See the Geological Sketch, post. The South Downs and the Forest Bidge are excelled in natural beauty by few counties in England. True, we have none of those very bold and romantic features which distinguish other districts, but the whole of Sussex presents to the eye of the observer, from thousands of points, scenery which can scarcely be equalled elsewhere in these regions; and whether we traverse the rude and comparatively barren heights of the vast Weald, or the graceful and shapely undulations of the Downs ; or whether we investigate the sweet windings of its various river-valleys with occasional marshy plains; or whether again we follow the curves of its seaboard with its lofty chalk cliffs and hills, alternating with lands scarcely raising themselves above the waters of the Channel, we shall find nearly everywhere something to admire and to please. The landscape is dotted all over with woods, and parks, and heathy commons, and pleasant smiling mansions and farm steads, and the remains of grim old Castles, mouldering Abbeys and Priories, and picturesque little churches innumerable. When Horace Walpole visited the county he was so delighted * Much etymological labour has been devoted to the meaning of Andred. The most probable derivation is from an, the Celtic negative particle, and dred, a dwel ling, i. e., a district without inhabitants. The Welsh, or Cambro-British word Andred, means an unfrequented or untrodden spot, which fully agrees with all that ancient writers, especially Bede, have said respecting the Wealds of Kent and Sussex. 1"], [18, "II PRELIMINARY HISTORY. with East Sussex that he styled it \" The Holy Land of Gothic abbeys and castles.\" If Sussex has a defect with regard to scenery it is, perhaps, lack of water. We have, certainly, some fine and beautiful ponds, but nothing that can with propriety be denominated a lake. From all that can be learnt of the earliest occupation of what is now the flourishing county of Sussex, we must believe that it was, in pre-historic times, for the most part one long uninhabited desert. Still, it must have had on its sea border, along the South Down range, some sort of colonization. This is evidenced from the hill forts on prominent parts of the Downs, such as Caburn, Hollingbury, Wolstanbury, Cissbury, Chanctonbury, &c. These earthworks now possess, for the most part, the Saxon termination bury (byrig), shoAving that the Anglo-Saxons, after their settlement in the island, occu pied the spots which their Celtic predecessors had strength ened. Of Boman occupation we have sufficient evidence, not only in their important stations of Begnum, Portus Adurni, and Anderida, answering without doubt to the modern loca lities called Chiehester, Bramber, and Pevensey. The counties of Surrey and Sussex, with small parts of Kent and Hampshire, had been held by the tribe of Britons called the Begni, whose principal town was Begnum, now Chiehester, and whose chief, Cogidubnus, is referred to in the \" Agricola\" of Tacitus as one of the British princes who maintained a constant fidelity to Bome. The ancient Britons have left numerous traces of their occupation of the soil in the hill fortresses of our Downs above referred to, as well as in barrows, in which many urns, filled with the ashes of the dead, have from time to time been brought to light, and gold coins, some of which are of the same types as those found on the opposite coasts of Gaul. They failed, however, in bequeathing to us any great number of topographical names, though Caburn, Glynde, Lewes, &c. may be traced to Celtic roots. Of the Eomans in Britain we have ample vestigia in Sussex. Professor Airey's theory of C\u00e6sar's having landed at Peven sey may be passed by as the vagary of a very able man ; but that the \" Conquerors of the World\" were well established in Sussex is irrefragably shown everywhere along the southern"], [19, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. III border, especially at Chiehester, Bignor, Pevensey, &c. Notices of their colonization, and the relics they left behind them, will be found in many of these pages. With the ex ception, however, of a votive tablet, now at Goodwood, and one or two other inscriptions, also found in and about Chi ehester, we have nothing of the \" litera scriptamanet.\" But if we find walls, built more Romano, tesselated pavements, hypocausts, urns, and coins innumerable, and above all the two Eoman roads called by the Saxons Ermin, or Hereman Street, showing it to have been a military way, and the more distinctly marked Stane Street, from Chiehester to London, large portions of which are bases of existing highways, we must be content to rest upon such assurances that, from the first century of the Christian era to the final departure of the Eomans, that grand people were well acquainted with Sussex, and had dominion here. Arriving at the period of that great irruption of the Teu tonic tribes, called the Anglo-Saxons, on our coasts, in the fifth century, we walk on still more certain and indisputable ground. In 477 \u00c6Ua and his three sons, Cyssa, Cymen, and Wlencing, with a marauding fleet, landed on the shore near the west end of the county, probably near Chiehester Harbour, at a place called Cymenes-ora, now Kynor, or Kymor, in the parish of Sidlesham. Cissa had Chiehester, and called it Cissanceaster, and perhaps also occupied the old Celtic fort further east called Cissbury, in the parish of Findon ; Wlen cing is conjectured to have given name to Lancing, in the same vicinity, while Cymen contented himself with giving name to the landing place. These brave unscrupulous men, with their forces, pushed their way eastward, driving the unfortunate Bomanized Britons into the fastnesses of the great Andredes-wald. They intrenched themselves in the hill fortresses which they found ready for their use, while \u00c6lla returned to the Continent for reinforcements, which having obtained, he landed at Shoreham and marched towards Mercreadesburn, conjectured to be either the modern Seaford or Eastbourne. Here tlie British forces assembled themselves in large numbers to resist tlie invaders, and a bloody battle was fought in 485. As a last resource the Britons en trenched themselves in and around the Eoman fortifications"], [20, "IV PRELIMINARY HISTORY. of Anderida (Bevensey), where they endured a long siege. The Saxons, however, succeeded, in carrying that ancient castrum by storm, and spared neither age nor sex in the infatuate fury of carnage. The power of the natives was so reduced by this loss that they were never afterwards enabled to make any successful resistance. Thus the Saxons won and conquered the land, and gave to the territory so obtained the name of Sud-seax, or Sussex, to distinguish it from the other kingdoms, which formed what is called the Saxon Heptarchy. \u00c6lla, the first South Saxon king, was succeeded by Cissa, a pacific monarch, in 514, and he by Edilwalch, the first Christian King of Sussex, who afforded succour to Wil- fred, Bishop of York, in his exile, when he was shipwrecked at Selsey. The King and Queen were already Christians, but their subjects still worshipped Thor and Odin, until that good man's arrival, when he effected a great change. Some cir- cumstances occurred which his biographers have deemed mira- culous. There had been no rain in these parts for three years, and the country was in a state of famine. The poor Saxons were driven to desperation, and many of them had made a resolve of binding themselves together in companies of 30 or 40 and throwing themselves into the sea. Wilfred prevented this wholesale suicide, and taught the poor crea- tures to fish, an art of which they had hitherto been ignorant, and they obtained a bountiful supply ; whereupon the chiefs and principal leaders sought Christian baptism, and the common people followed their example. On the first day of baptism there fell a copious rain, and the earth again became fruitful. Thus \" Man's necessity became God's opportunity,\" and Sussex was, at least nominally, Christianized. Edil- walch rewarded his friend with the territory of Selsey and other possessions, and there he established the see of Selsey, which remained until its removal, under William the Con- queror, to Chiehester. Edilwalch, who was a great bene- factor to the Archbishops of Canterbury, was succeeded by Berthun and Authun, two brothers, who reigned jointly as Kings of the South Saxons until they were vanquished by Ceadwal, King of Wessex who annexed Sud-seax to his do- minions, and Sussex remained part of Wessex, until Egbert became \"King of all England.\""], [21, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. V The firm hold which the Anglo-Saxons took of Sussex is evidenced by the discovery of many antiquities, and more especially by the nomenclature of most of its towns, parishes, and minor localities. To give a few examples the following list may suffice : \u2014 A.-Sax. Ham, a manor, home, or hamlet. Horsham, West-ham, Beddingham, Withyham, Greatham, Northiam, Stone- ham, &c. Ford, a fordable place in a river. Ford, Avisford, Kirdford, Longford, Pippingford, &c. Leg, or Ly, a field with some reference to neighbouring wood- lands. Ardingly, Hothly, Hellingly, Chiddingly, Amber- ley, &c. Tim, an inclosure, village, or town. Alfriston, Aldrington, Brighthelmston, Selmeston, Chalvington, Westmeston, Sin- gleton, Compton, Wilmington, with many otters, \" quce nunc prcescribere longum est.\" This is a very favourite ter- mination. Ing, see Kemble on \" mearcs.\" Steyning, Worthing, Harting, Beeding, Poling, Mailing, Wittering, &c. Hurst, hyrst, a wood, yielding food for cattle, and therefore not precisely a wood or forest. Midhurst, Chithurst, Hurst- Monceux, Hurst-Pierpont, Billingshurst, &c. Wudu, wood. Goodwood, Iwood, Chelwood, &c. Wie, a village or town. Southwick, Bumboldswyke, Aldwick, Newick, &c. Stede, a place, station, or \" stead.\" Berstead, Horsted, Grin- stead, Binsted, Stanstead, &c. Fe Id, plain open ground. Cuckfield, Maresfield, Henfield, Lind- field, Netherfield, &c. Bourne, a rivulet or boundary (which rivers often were) . West- bourne, Nutbourne, Fishboume, Easebourne, &c. Cote, a small dwelling or cottage. Woodmancote, Sealcote, &c. Ceaster, a fortified Roman station adopted by the Saxons, as Chiehester, Hasting-ceaster (Hastings), &c. Cumb, a trough-like valley. Balcombe, Moulscombe, Harting- Combe, Sedlescombe, Saddlescomb, &c. By rig, burh, a town, borough, or fortified place. Pulborough, Swanborough, Hawksborough, Bury, Burton, Burwash, Burghill, &c. Benu, a sheltered place affording food for animals. A den, in Kent, seems generally to mean a feeding place for swine. In Sussex it almost invariably signifies a hollow place among downs \u2014 a shelter for sheep. Thus we have two East and two West-Deans, Ovingdean, Rottingdean, Balsdean, the Mardens, Pangdean, &c."], [22, "VI PRELIMINARY HISTORY. Ed, water, or ig, an island. Pevensey, Thorney, Selsey, Horseye, Northeye, &c. Wurd, nyrd, a homestead, \"worth,\" or estate. Worth, Worth- ing, Petworth, Densworth, Littleworth, &c. Bun, elevated land, down. Willingdon, High-down, Slindon, and par excellence, the South Downs. Stow, or Stoc, a dwelling-place. North and South Stoke, Stock- bridge, &c. To these might easily be added hundreds of other instances, which every Sussex man will call to mind. I have given the principal roots of local names in the county, but many others, such as Marsh, Wade, Well, Cliff, Stone, Beck, Sand, Shaw, Hill, suffisiently explain themselves. The irruptions of the Danes and Norsemen, which were but desultory and occasional, have left us a few local names, wliich differ but little from those impressed upon our county by their neighbours the Anglo-Saxons. We have, however, Dane-hill, Dane-hurst, Dane-gate, Hastings, Seaford (See Fiord), old Norse for \" the Bay,\" and several others. The oblong barrows found on some parts of the Downs have been fanci fully supposed to represent the inverted ships of the Vikings, but this is unlikely, as their contents have generally proved to be of the Celtic type. The discovery of a supposed Danish ship at Northiam is alluded to in the notice of Eye. I think I can trace the Danish or Norseman type in the figures and countenances of many of our sea-going Sussex men. Floating down the stream of Time we arrive at the in vasion of the Normans, and soon land on firm historical ground. The Conquest achieved by Duke William at Hastings put a new face on the condition of things, and especially upon the counties of Kent and Sussex. That great and politic man took care to strengthen the southern frontier of his newly acquired dominions by conferring upon his own immediate relatives and connections the whole county of Sussex. He gave to Eobert, Earl of Eu, the Eape of Hastings ; to Eobert, Earl of Moreton, the Bape of Bevensey; to William, Earl of Warenne and Surrey, his son-indaw, the Bape of Lewes: to William de Braose, the Bape of Bramber; and to Boger, Earl de Montgomeri, the Bapes of Arundel and Chiehester. The mention of Rapes here affords an opportunity of ex plaining that term. Yorkshire has its \" Eidings\" and Kent"], [23, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. VII its \" Lathes,\" but no English county except Sussex has its \"Bapes.\" I may be pardoned for the following self-quotation : \u2014 The word Bape seems to be peculiar to Sussex, unless it may be considered identical with the Hrepp of Iceland. That in teresting island was divided into four quarters, each of which was partitioned into prefectures or sheriffdorns, and these again were subdivided into small districts called hrepps, consisting of families who lived contiguous to each other. Generally they were of the size of the present Icelandic parishes, and over each of these was appointed a kreppstiori or bailiff, who had the im mediate inspection of his own bailiwick (Henderson's \"Iceland,\" 1818). From this it would appear that the Icelandic hrepp was a much less important territory than the Sussex Rape. The etymology of the word is uncertain ; but it seems to be con nected with the Welch rhafs, the Anglo-Saxon rap, r\u00e6p, the Danish reep, reeb, and the Gothic raip, signifying a rope. It was a practice among the Teutonic tribes to set out allotments by means of a cord or rope, just as a modern land surveyor em ploys his Gunter's chain, and in Iceland the measure of land is still by the rope. In a very recent publication by an able French antiquary (Hericher) we meet with the following passage ; \u2014 \" We shall find in Normandy a great number of the names of those chiefs to whom Rollo distributed Neustria by the cord : ' Suis fidelibus terrain funiculo divisit.' \" The geographical area of Sussex is 1,466 square miles, or 934,851 acres, and the Population in 1861 was 363,735, which has since then much increased. Camden remarks that Sussex, in its civil capacity, is divi ded into six parts called Rapes, every one of which, besides its several hundreds, has its Castle, its River, and its Forest. This remarkable assertion, though not true in every particu lar in Camden's own day, had been so in earlier days, and the great Antiquary doubtless makes use of a proverbial re mark derived from those times.* The following seems to be the arrangement : \u2014 Rapes. Castles. Rivers. Forests. Hastings. Hastings. The Bother. Dallington. Pevensey. Pevensey. \u201e Cuckmere. Ashdown. Lewes. Lewes. \u201e Ouse. Worth. Bramber. Bramber. \u201e Adur. St. Leonards. Arundel. Arundel. \u201e Arun. Arundel. Chichester. Chichester, \u201e Lavant. Charlton. (destroyed.)"], [24, "VIII PRELIMINARY HISTORY. These Bapes, which run in a direction almost due south and north, are divided into many hundreds, of which here after. The grand statistical Survey known as Domesday Book, finished- just before the death of the Conqueror, 1086, gives us the following names of the \"over-lords\" or chief feudal possessors of the soil : \u2014 Here are inrolled the Land-Holders in Sussex. 1. King William. 2. The Archbishop of Canterbury. 3. The Bishop of Chiehester. 4. The Abbot of Westminster. 5. The Abbot of Fecamp in Normandy. 6. Osbern, Bishop of Exeter. 7. The Abbey of Winchester. 8. The Abbey of Battle. 9. The Earl of Eu. 10. The Earl of Moreton. 11. Earl Boger (de Montgomeri). 12. William de Warren. 13. William de Braose. 14. Odo de Winchester. 15. Eldred. The total number of manors, held either in domain or by subinfeudations, was 387, and that of hides 3,480. As a hide generally represents only from 100 to 120 acres, the particu lars of the Survey include only those portions of the county wliich had been brought more or less under cultivation. The civil government of the united counties of Surrey and Sussex was vested in a vice-comes or Sheriff, annually chosen ; and a tolerably correct list of these officials from 1154 to our own times is given by Horsfield (\" History of Sussex,\" i^ 85). The principal civil and military officer has been from the time of Henry VIII. a Lord Lieutenant, who holds office for life, and appoints magistrates and deputy-lieutenants at pleasure. The division of England into hundreds dates from the time of the Anglo-Saxon Conquest. It was a practice pre vailing among the Teutonic tribes, and as Tacitus informs us in his \" Germania \" the hundred consisted of the inhabitants of a district containing one hundred families. Much altera tion has taken place in the distribution of hundreds, and many changes of name have occurred since the date of Domesday. The following are the existing hundreds and the names of the parishes which they include : \u2014 EASTERN DIVISION. Alciston. \u2014 Alciston, Lullington, Alfriston.

Those in the Archdeaconry of Lewes are Lewes, Dallington, Hastings, and Pevensey, and, locally, that of South Mailing for the Peculiars. Battle also possesses a Dean for a small circumjacent district. (See Battle.) There are also Eural Deaneries which have neither legislative nor executive power, however useful they may be for parochial suggestion and co operation. The Dissenters have also unions for co-operation in nearly every Brotestant denomination, and upon the whole few counties are more prominent, either in or out of the esta blishment, for ministerial zeal, piety, and educational appli ances, than Sussex. The number of religious houses in the county before the Eeformation, including colleges and hospitals, was upwards of sixty. The Civil Government of Sussex is the same as that of other counties. The Lord-Lieutenant is also Keeper of the Eolls or Eecords (Custos Botulorum), and he appoints magis trates, deputy-lieutenants, and subordinate officers connected with county business. The High- Sheriff is appointed annu ally, as in other counties. A list of the high sheriffs from 1154 has been printed in Berry's \" Sussex Genealogies \" and elsewhere. The present Lord-Lieutenant is the Earl of Chichestek. It must be remarked that from a very early period the counties of Sussex and Surrey were united under one sheriffdom, but, since the 9th year of Queen Elizabeth, the two counties have been distinct for all civil purposes."], [30, "XIV PRELIMINARY HISTORY. INDUSTEY. Sussex is now almost a purely Agricultural and Pastoral county, though in former times several manufactures were carried on within its limits. The soil varies from rich arable, not surpassed in England, to very poor, \" thin\" land, some of which is hardly worthy of cultivation. The South Down dis trict is almost entirely devoted to the breeding of tbe sheep. bearing that name, so widely renowned throughout England. The marshes are extremely rich, and well adapted for the fatting of cattle. The Sussex ox is almost as well known as the South Down sheep. For symmetry no animal of the bovine tribe can be pronounced superior to it. The colour is now red ; in former times it was black, but the cause of that change seems to be unknown. Among the industrial arts that of ship and boat building has always been carried on in the county. In the days of our great-grandfathers, and even since, textile manufactures existed to a considerable extent. In every parish possessing suitable soils flax and hemp were cultivated, as is evidenced by the names of fields called flax-fields, hemp-plots, &c. Every mansion, farmhouse, and cottage had its spinning wheel, and many a village had its weaver who converted the products into a fine strong linen, far superior to that which we now buy. The whitening of the cloth was the work of local fullers, and \"fulling-mill fields\" are found in numerous parishes. The timber trade was also largely carried on in the clays when Sussex oak was regarded as the finest ship-building timber in the world. Hops were first introduced into Eng land by a Sussex man, Leonard Mascall, of Plumpton, temp. Henry VIII. This precarious vegetable is widely cultivated in East Sussex, and although the hops of Kent by a popular prejudice, are preferred to those of this county, there seems to be no real difference between them. But the greatest branch of industry carried on in Sussex in ancient times, was the manufacture of Iron, a trade which existed, though on a much diminished scale, down to the end of the last century, and even in one instance (at Ashburnham) so lately as the year 1825. I have shown in a paper on the subject in Vol. ii. ofthe \" Sussex Collections,\" and elsewhere,'"], [31, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. XV that the manufacture was carried on at Maresfield and other places in the first century of the Christian era, and that in later ages more iron-works existed in Sussex than in all the kingdom beside. The destruction of our great forests for the smelting and working, which was then by charcoal only, trans ferred the works to other and distant counties. The iron-ore, however, exists in great plenty throughout our Weald ; and it is not at all improbable that, with present opportunities of transit, pit-coals may be brought hither, and the iron-works resuscitated. The manufacture of salt was formerly carried on to a great extent on the coast. See notices in these volumes, passim. SKETCH OF THE GEOLOGY OF SUSSEX. By JAMES HOWELL. The rocks which constitute the crust of the earth are calculated by mathematicians to be from 800 to 1,000 miles in thickness. They are divided into the fossiliferous and the non-fossiliferous. The fossiliferous are sub-divided into Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Post- Tertiary. The Primary rest upon the metamorphic or stratified crystalline rocks, such as clay-slate, mica-schist, and gneiss, sedimentary, but changed by the action of fire : hence their name. Below these lie the foundations of the earth, granite, syenite, porphyry, and green stone. The theory that the centre of the earth is a surging mass of liquid fire is corroborated by the fact, that the farther we penetrate into the bosom of the earth, the higher is the temperature, the increase being one degree for about every 55 feet. In a paper lately read before the Eoyal Society by Mr. Hull, mention is made of the sink ing of a shaft near Wigan to the depth of nearly half a mile, the greatest distance ever yet attained. The temperature of the coal at the bottom of this mine is 93\u00a3 degrees ! The oldest organism discovered in the stratified rocks was a Ehizopod (the Eozoon Ganadense), entombed in the Lower Laurentian. Here life begins its immortal career, and be comes developed, higher and higher up through the whole"], [32, "XVI PRELIMINARY HISTORY. series of rocks, till it finally reaches its maximum in Man! From the diatom to the oak, from the sponge to man, how wonderful the gradations! how perfect the developement ! Up through the Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian, flows the ancient river of life. Upon the border land of the old and middle periods, a mightier and more wonderful stream commences its course, rushing through the Triassic, Liassic, Oolitic, Wealden, and Cretaceous. Again the stream changes from Beptilian to Mammalian life up through the Tertiary Eocene, Miocene, Bliocene, and Post- Pliocene worlds ; and on it flowed, and still flows, through the Becent, more wonderful and mighty than ever, towards its destined goal, the Ocean of Eternity ! As these life-rocks are the result of sub-aqueous action, having been disposed in horizontal sedimentary layers at the bottom of the ocean, they consequently maintain a certain order of super-position, which, however great the displace ment or interruption, is never inverted. At Brighton the Bost-Pliocene rests upon the chalk, while at Newhaven it is the Plastic Clay. The relative disposition of the masses remains unaltered by the absence of any of the intervening strata. Should the Lower Green Sand be absent, then the Gault above it reposes on Wealden Clay, and should there be no Upper Green Sand, then the chalk rests upon the Gault. Were it not for denudation and upheaval, our knowledge of the rocks would be scanty indeed. It seems as if the Creator had arranged the strata in such a manner as to enable man, by the use of the splendid faculties with which He has endowed him, to observe their order of succession, to analyze their constituent elements, to behold the monuments of life entombed within them, and to deduce therefrom the history of the grand old world of which he is the chief denizen. In the following Tabular Arrangement of the Strata of Sussex, it will be seen that none of the Primary Bocks rise to the surface, the lowest being the Ashburnham Beds, belonging to the Secondary Series. In Sussex the strata incline towards the south-east, and \"a line,\" as Mantell truly observes, \" drawn from the coast through the interior of the county would pass over the bassetting edges of the strata in regular succession.\""], [33, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY.

This world of ours has ever been, as it is now, in a state of perpetual motion; possessing the life-giving principle of crea tion and destruction impressed upon it by the fiat of its great Creator, viz., the power of destroying the Old to form the New, by sub-aerial and fluviatile action, pulverizing the rocks, carry ing their contents by stream and river into the sea, and forming new continents from the wrecks of the old ! Relatively speaking time is nothing. Cycles are but as moments ; milhons of ages but as days. Steadily, and almost imperceptibly, the great revolu tions of the earth are produced. The ocean tears down the cliffs, grinds the flints into pebbles, gravel, and sand ; spreads out the softer materials over its immense basin, layer by layer, in which it entombs the organisms of life, and after the lapse of innumerable ages, the internal fires of the earth elevate the strata above the surface of the sea, and another world com mences its ever changing career. The restless sea is thus the creative mother of the land ; when the latter becomes effete she takes it in her loving bosom, and re-infuses within it the wondrous spirit of life. Since the period when the present world emerged from its watery cradle, she has been continually giving and receiving presents from her child, the earth. Cities, towns, and villages, fields, arable lands and forests, alluvial tracts and lofty cliffs, along the whole length of our Sussex coast have disappeared beneath her watery domain. At her command, her obedient tributaries, estuary, river, and stream, have silted up their beds, which have become dry lands, the sup port of flocks and herds, and fields of graceful corn. If we penetrate into, and examine, the silt of our Sussex Levels, we shall obtain indisputable proofs of the slowness of this process. The silt de scends to the depth of thirty feet in the Lewes Levels, yet from"], [36, "XX PRELIMINARY HISTORY. the discovery of coins at Beddingham and other places, the in crease has only been as many inches since the reign of the Emperor Domitian ! The soil upon which we tread is a recent deposit, and yet, what ages must have past since it first commenced ! From this, one single step down the highway of time brings us within the confines of another world, that of THE POST-PLIOCENE. This was the period of the drift, the Glacial Epoch, when beds of gravel and flints, coombe-rock, breccia and brick-loam, lying in hollows and fissures of the Downs, and even upon some of their summits, and over the surface of the lower lands, were deposited through the agency of icebergs and stormy waves, which piled up the mass of partly stratified materials constituting the Brighton Cliffs. That period when the land was continually sinking and rising in and out of its ocean bed, when vast forests and fertile valleys existed where the English Channel now flows, uniting this island with the Continent, there browsed the mammoth, the rhinoceros, the goat and reindeer, the ox, and the horse; and there the sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, hyena and bear prowled and preyed. But what renders this deposit so highly interesting is the important fact of its ushering Man into this world of life ; of being the birth-world and cradle of the human race ! The remains of what we believe to have been Paleolithic man, enclosed in a rude coffin, formed of four hewn trunks of the oak tree fastened together by oaken pegs, was discovered at a great depth in the blue silt of Beeding Levels. The skull was stained blue, and the bones were filled with blue phosphate of fron. Two ancient canoes, hewn out of a solid oak, with no metal fastenings, have also been discovered, the one now in the British Museum, found in the Arun Levels, the other in the mud by the sea-shore opposite Heene Lane, near Worthing ; the latter containing several Post-Pliocene shells. Since that olden time, our Sussex land has subsided and been again elevated far above its former level.* The beach, washed by a Post-Glacial sea, is now framed in the Brighton Cliffs from ten to fifteen feet above the present one, and in the coombe-rock reposing upon this beach, the remains of the mammoth, ox, horse, and deer, have been found, and those of the Greenland whale in the sands beneath it. From this deposit to * The most elevated portions of these beds are upwards of 200 feet above the level of the sea, in the Temple Field, Brighton, which fully proves that the whole district has been raised to that height since the Post-Plioceno Epoch."], [37, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. XXI THE MIDDLE EOCENE of Bracklesham and Selsey, there is an immense gap in the strata of Sussex. Pliocene, Miocene, and Upper Eocene are all absent, the \" drift\" in these places resting conformably upon the Middle Eocene. Walk along the shore through Bracklesham Bay at the ebb of the tide, and you will perceive the tertiary beds laid bare by the encroaching sea. The shells, with which these clays are so thickly studded, are in so brittle a condition that it requires the greatest care and much experience to pre serve them whole. These strata extend from Bracklesham to Selsey and Pagham, and beneath the sea to Bognor, where a line of rocks, visible at low water, reveals the true characteristics of the LONDON CLAY, containing microscopical shells, nummulites, corals, remains of fishes, crocodiles, sharks, the Lophiodon, a tapir-like animal, and wood resembling that of the cocoa-nut. The nummulite was so abundant in the Eocene seas as to enter into the compo sition of the mountain ranges of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and to stamp in legible characters upon their walls the epoch of their creation ! Opposite the mill at Felpham lies a small patch of the Lower Eocene beds, and from thence to Brighton there is no more of this formation by the sea shore. On Furze Hill, in the parish of Hove, there is an outlyer of THE PLASTIC CLAY, through which flows a chalybeate spring, celebrated for its medicinal effects. The Post Pliocene formation, upon which the town of Brighton stands, everywhere reveals the wreck and ruin of these strata, but nowhere more fully than in the neigh bouring Temple Field. Here the tertiary sands and clays are mingled confusedly with chalk, flints, breccia, sub-sulphate of alumina, and gypsum, nearly the whole being in a ruinous con dition. The sub-sulphate of alumina is found in irregular patches about twelve feet from the surface, but, in common with the flints, so brittle as to crumble at the slightest pressure. The breccia dug up at the depth of 16^ feet is very pecubar. In some pieces the core is completely destroyed by chemical heat, and in others filled with lenticular crystals of gypsum, while others are ornamented with botryoidal and reniform crys tallizations, coated with a bloom, varying in colour from reddish brown to yellow ochre and olive green. Some specimens so closely resemble slag as to deceive all but the initiated."], [38, "XXII PRELIMINARY HISTORY. The section of Plastic and Mottled Clay in Newhaven Cliffs clearly reveals the origin of the heterogeneous mass composing the Temple Field. This consists of sand and pebbles, coarse rock, composed of oyster shells, foliated blue clay, with innu merable shells and sharks' teeth ; brown marl, with impressions of leaves, wood, and cones of the palm tribe, casts of potamides and cyclades; lignite; blue clay with sulphur-coloured marl, including gypsum, crystalized and fibrous ; sand of various colours ; breccia of pebbles and angular flints impregnated with iron, forming a hard conglomerate ; and ochraceous clay, con taining hydrate and sub-sulphate of alumina with gypsum. On the opposite end of the bay, Cliff-end, Seaford, the sands of this interesting deposit, reposing on breccia in situ four feet thick, rise to the height of fifty feet. Palms, screw pines, cocoa-nuts, nautili, sea-snakes, crocodiles, and turtles, prove the climate of the lower Eocene world to have been tropical, at which time England was most probably an archipelago. Down, lower down the ladder of Time \u2014 the descent being difficult through the removal of several steps \u2014 we enter the Secondary Worlds, and stand upon THE CRETACEOUS STRATA, the foundation upon which we dwellers on the South Downs \" live, move, and have our being.\" The Tertiary beds are rare in Sussex, the Cretaceous everywhere, for the Wealden are members of this series. And what is chalk, which composes the grand old hills and the undulating valleys of our Downs ? It is the dust of life ! nearly every atom being so minute an organism that 10,000,000 are contained in every pound's weight. Then what myriads of beings must have lived and died to build up the cretaceous strata ! How sublime the idea that beings so infinitessimally small can build up worlds so vast, in whose remains are entombed sponges, stone-lilies, star-fishes, sea urchins, the lobster tribe, fishes, reptiles, and turtles, which, with the contour of hill, undulating coombe, and excavated valley, proclaim the cloud-capped Downs to have been, in the days of old, the basin of a deep sea. Beneath these strata lie the chalk -marls and the Upper Greensand, succeeded by the Gault and the Lower Greensand, formed at an earlier epoch by the same ocean, when the Weald was sinking down foot by foot to receive the immense burden heaped upon it. A fine section of these strata was obtained in digging the Warren Farm Well, near the Brighton Race Course, reaching the enormous depth of 1285 feet. The thickness of chalk and chalk marls was 968 feet ; Upper Green Sand, seven feet ; Gault, 307\u00a3 feet, upwards of 204 feet deeper than the older Geologist"], [39, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. XXIII had surmised ; Lower Green Sand, 2\u00a3 feet. Passing through the Lower Green Sand, extending in some places to 800 feet, we arrive at THE WEALDEN FORMATION. Let us in imagination, if not in reality, stand upon the highest point of the South Downs, Ditchling Beacon, and gaze over the rich and fertile valley extending to the high hills of Surrey and Kent looming in the distance. This valley was once an estuary of the sea into which a mighty river poured its waters, mingled with the flora and fauna of the oolitic world. And this escarp ment, rushing precipitously into the valley below, a steep cliff, whose base was laved by the waters of an ancient sea, which scooped out the superincumbent strata, extending from Folk stone in Kent to Petersfield in Hampshire, and back from Petersfield to Eastbourne in Sussex, the whole area forming an irregular triangle. The hills stretching from east to west through the middle of this valley of denudation and elevation, form an anticlinal axis, that is, the strata dip in opposite direc tions, encircling the Forest Ridge with zones or belts of Weald Clay, Lower Green Sand, Gault, and Upper Green Sand, to the rim of the chalk at the extreme ends of the valley. The Wealden Strata are of fresh water origin, deposited by a river flowing through the country of the Iguanodon, and its Saurian contemporaries, teeming with thick jungles, composed of graceful and arborescent ferns, conifers, and cycadea ; high sunny river-banks, where basked herbivorous Saurians, gigantic and terrible ; while bat-like Pterodactyles rose on colossal pinions and fanned the sultry air. Fish with enamelled and plaited scales sported in the sparkling waters of that ancient river, while myriads of Paludina, Unio, Cyclas, and Cyprides, swarmed in its muddy bed, or about the marshy land, associated with the Estherian Phyllopods, and the Ostracoda. But now jungles and trees, saurian reptiles and flying lizards, enamelled fishes, leaf-footed and minute shell-clad crustaceans, marsh snails, unio, cyclas and cyprides, mingled with the ruins of that mighty continent, swept pell-mell into the estuary of that broad river, have been metamorphosed by the hand of Time into laminated beds of clay, marble, and sandstone to the depth of 1,340 feet ! How and when was this Wealden Valley denuded of the cretaceous strata, and the Forest Ridge of the Weald Clay and some portions even ofthe Hastings Sand? Chalk, flints, gault, green sands, and Weald clay have been bodily removed to the depth of more than 2,000 feet, and the strata elevated to an immense height, so as to bring the crest of Crowborough Beacon"], [40, "XXIV PRELIMINARY HISTORY. to within a few feet of the highest summit of the South Downs. This upheaval changed the course of the Sussex rivers, which, previous to that event, flowed eastward, but the elevation of the Wealden fissured the chalk hills on either side of the valley, and through these transverse fissures the rivers now flow from their sources in the Forest Ridge northward into the Thames, and southward into the English Channel. The work of denudation was the work of ages, and it has been ascertained by Sir Charles Lyell to have commenced before the deposition of the oldest Eocene beds, and probably before the formation of the Maestrecht strata, or during their deposition, as rolled pebbles of chalk flints are abundant in parts of that formation, which overlies the white chalk, shewing how early the chalk was upraised from deep water and exposed to aqueous abrasion. But how was the denudation accompbshed ? As the strata rose dome-like above the surface of the ocean, they were most probably pared off by the waves, aided by atmospheric action; the softer materials more effectually, hence the deep-grooved valleys on the gault and weald-clay, but the chalk, greensands, sand stone and limestone resisting the denuding power of the waves, now form the ridges and abrupt descents which face the anti clinal axis, the latter being caused by the falling in of these strata after the waters had scooped out the underlying clays. Everywhere throughout the valley is the denuding force visible. The high rocks of Tunbridge Wells, the Uckfield rocks, the Great uj>on Little at Ardingly, the lake overhung by sandstone rocks at Fletching, the Hastings Cliffs, the romantic Shepherd's Glen and Lovers' Seat at Fairlight, all clearly reveal the denu ding power of the waves : how they scooped out deep gorges in the softer material, and undermined and broke down the harder, wearing away the friable rocks and leaving those of a more compact substance resting upon them, so as to excite our astonishment at the wondrous laws which God has made, both to create and to destroy worlds ! In concluding this brief sketch of the Geology of Sussex, we would impress upon the reader's mind that time works slowly, but effectively : that all the mighty revolutions of the globe, organic and inorganic, are the work of Ages. The building up of the fossiliferous rocks to a height of twenty three miles, the upheaval of the mountain ranges, the scoop ing out of the basins of the ocean, the subsidence of the liquid fires that once raged in and overflowed the craters of extinct volcanoes, the uprising of coral islands from the ocean's depths, and their conversion into Continents ; their degrada-"], [41, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. XXV tion, and the formation of deltas inch by inch from their debris ; the introduction and extinction of species; the revolution of sun and planets around a central sun, aud stellar systems around a central system; and finally the creation and de struction of Worlds. Though each of these phenomena has probably occupied from thousands to hundreds of thousands and millions of years, yet the movement of the second hand upon the face of Eternity's Dial has, to the Great Creative Spirit, whose will is law, been wholly imperceptible. In connection with my friend Mr. Howell's Geological Sketch, it is appropriate to say a few words on the Rivers of Sussex. I have studied the subject with much care and attention, and in Vols. xv. and xvi. of the \" Sussex Collec tions,\" have printed papers containing all I could collect con cerning the sources, tributaries, courses, and debouchures of the Sussex rivers, and the associations connected with the more remarkable spots upon their banks. The easternmost river of the county is the Rother, which rises at, and gives name to, Rotherfield. Its former outlet was near Hythe in Kent, but it now debouches at the thriving port of Rye. As I have remarked in the body of this work, the tendency of the Atlantic wave has caused much change in the outlets of our rivers, and the accumulation of shingle has driven the waters towards the east, at the back of the beach. This was remarkably exemplified in the case of the Rother. Proceeding towards the west, our next river is the Asten, wliich formerly made the \" Port \" of Hastings, now no longer a port. It rises at Battle, but the stream is quite incon siderable. The Ashburn rises a little northward of Ashburn ham, and gives name to that ancient parish. At the distance of a few miles (at Pevensey) it falls noiselessly into the English Channel, no visible outlet or harbour existing. The Cuckmere is so called from its debouchure in a level two miles east of Seaford. This level was anciently a \" mere \" or lake, and now during winter floods it assumes that appearance. It rises in the parishes of Heathfield and Waldron. Still travelling west ward we reach the Ouse, which rises at Ardingly, and has affluents from Slaugham and many other points, especially 3"], [42, "PRELIMINARY history. XXVI what is called the Uckfield River. Passing through Lewes it now reaches Newhaven, its natural outlet, though for cen turies it met the sea at Seaford. Between Lewes and New haven, the Ritch, originating from the neighbourhood of Laughton, Firle, and other points, joins the high stream, and a number of waters flow concurrently into the Channel. A little river formerly giving name to the Hundred of Wells bourne, now corrupted to Whalesbone, rose at Patcham, a few miles north of Brighton, and passed by Preston through the now great watering-place at a depressed spot still known as PooZ-valley. Few traces of it are observable, except in heavy rains, when the stream (sometimes inconveniently) appears upon the surface, though usually it passes through drains into the sea. The next river is the Adur, which gave name to the Roman \" Portus Adurni.\" This river, which ramifies like a tree, is best explained by the map pre fixed to this work. Its natural outlet is Shoreham, but, by the force of the south-west winds, it now reaches the sea at Kingston-Buci, nearly two miles eastward of that town. The Arun rises in the neighbourhood of Horsham, and after re ceiving as an affluent the Western Rother (by far the most beautiful river of Sussex) near Pulborough, passes by a ser pentine course to Arundel, to which it gives name, and thence to its port at Littlehampton. The Lavant is a very small stream, which rises a few miles north of Chiehester, partly encircles that ancient city, and reaches the sea at Dellquay. The Ems, a very small but beautiful stream, rises near Stoughton, and debouches at Emsworth, just over the Sussex border. The Forest Ridge is a considerable Watershed, and hence, while the general tendency of Sussex rivers is southward, a few minor streams send their waters to the north, and form affluents to the Thames and Medway, These are the Mole, rising near Worth ; the Medway, whose sources are near East Grinstead and Crowborough ; and the Tees, which has its rise near Ticehurst. The principal sources of Sussex history and topography which have appeared in print are given in three painstaking articles"], [43, "PRELIMINARY HISTORY. XXVII in Vols. xv., xvi., and xvii. of the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6olo- gical Collections,\" by Geo. Slade Butler, Esq., F.S.A. Of course, the basis of the history of this and the other counties of England, is the \" Britannia \" of Camden, whose remark- able work needs no commendation from my humble pen. Leland, his topographical predecessor, has little to say respect- ing Sussex. Our poetical topographer, Drayton, in his \" Polyolbion,\" to me one of the grandest of English poems, gives a good account of our rivers, which is not only geo- graphically correct, but full of noble diction and fine senti- ment. Sir William Dugdale furnishes us with much interesting information in his \" History of Imbanking and Draining,\" especially in connection with the eastern part of the county. In the last century Sir William Burrell, Bart, (born 1-733, died 179G), undertook, at a large outlay of labour and expense, to collect materials for a full history of the county. He spent great part of his life in the pursuit, but his work was never completed. At his death his Collections became, by bequest, the property of the nation, and they are now care- fully preserved in the British Museum. Several small compilations on the general history of the county, but of little value, appeared in the 18th century; and it was not until the beginning of the present century that any attempt to produce a copious History of Sussex (as to the western division only) was made. The Duke of Norfolk patronized the undertaking, and the Rev. James Dallaway, M.A., F.S.A. , was the author of the work. He lived to see the completion of the Rapes of Chiehester and Arundel, but not long enough to carry out the entire design. His mantle fell upon the shoulders of the Rev. Edmund Cartwright, also M.A., and F.S.A., wdio wrote the history of the Rape of Bramber, thus completing the design. \" The History of Western Sussex,\" forming three lordly tomes, is associated with misfortunes. The first and second volumes were des- troyed by fire at the printing offices, a few copies only being rescued. Mr. Cartwright reprinted the Rape of Arundel after having completed that of Bramber, and these two volumes, though scarce, are not so rare as the Rape of Chiehester, of which only about sixty copies exist. He is a fortunate man who possesses the whole work, which, in spite"], [44, "XXVIII PRELIMINARY HISTORY. of various blemishes, is a valuable addition to County History. The first attempt at a comprehensive account of the whole county was made by the Rev. Thomas Walker Horsfield, F.S.A., published in two quarto volumes by Mr. Baxter, of Lewes, in 1835, under the title of \" The History, Antiquities, and Topography ofthe County of Sussex.\" This work, like the \" Western Sussex\" is well illustrated and useful. The various towns of the county have had numerous historians, for whom I must refer to Mr. G. S. Butler's articles above referred to. And now I introduce a few corrections and additions which have occurred to me during the progress of the printing, and which should be read before a general perusal of the work. I must add that in consequence of an oversight in one or two instances, the alphabetical arrangement of parishes has not been strictly observed. ARDINGLY. Wakehurst Place, the old mansion of the Culpepers, has been purchased by the Marchioness of Down shire, who is restoring it, and making large and expensive additions. \u2014 The first stone of the \"Anglican\" school which was laid by Earl Granville in 1864, will consist of two large quadrangles.

Angmering, which is mentioned in King Alfred's will as Angmeringum, was formerly three distinct parishes, known as East and West Angmering and Bargeham ; but these have long been consolidated. Angmering was long dependent upon the Abbey of Fecamp in Normandy, and afterwards on the nunnery of Sion in Middlesex. At the Dissolution, the property was granted to the ancient Sussex family of Palmer, who built New Place, temp. Elizabeth. Angmering Park, which is beautifully wooded, lies principally in this parish, and belongs to the Duke of Norfolk. It is related in Fuller's \" Worthies \" that the three brothers, Sir John, Sir Thomas, and Sir Henry Painter, sons of Sir Edward Palmer, of this parish (all knighted by Henry VIII.), were produced at one birth, and on three successive Sundays, their mother having been \" a full fortnight inclusively in labour.\" However the scepticism of modern science may doubt the possi bihty, there appears to be good historical evidence of the fact. Bargeham church had fallen to decay before the Reformation. In that district of the existing parish of Angmering is Ham, for more than three centuries the estate of a branch of the ancient family of Gratwicke. It formerly had a chapel. The churches of East Angmering and West Angmering were almost contiguous. That of East Angmering, which was dedicated to St. Nicholas, has long disappeared. The present church (St. Margaret), con sists of a chancel, nave, and south aisle, including various styles from Early English to Perpendicular. The date 1507 is inscribed on the tower. There are inscriptions to the Gratwicke family, and a brass (despoiled of its figure) to \u00a9Um Waiter, 1508, &c. The church was almost entirely rebuilt at the cost of W. K.

The Bishop of Chiehester had a mansion and park here, of sufficient importance to give hospi tality to King John, and King Edward I. The park, which was of large extent, was not disparked until the 17th century. The Bishops had here a large Staurum or farmstead for horses, cattle, sheep, &c. The mansion was destroyed by Sir Wm. Waller's forces during the civil wars. The parish comprises the ham lets of Westergate, Norton, and Lidsey, in the last of which there was formerly a chapel. Many Roman remains (pottery, &c.) have been found at Westergate. Nyton, formerly a \"grange'' belonging to the neighbouring priory of Boxgrove, became in more recent times the seat of the family of Peckham. The church of St. Mary is of considerable antiquity. The chan cel has a window of the 13th century, and sedilia ; and there are other interesting ecclesiological features.

The sea has greatly encroached on the parish, which was for a time the port of the river Adur. The village, the im portance of which had been decreasing pari passu with this en croachment, was still, about the year 1700, possessed of a population of 200, who inhabited a row of houses on the shore. According to Magna Britannia, in 1738 few of the houses re mained, most of them having succumbed to the great storm of 1703, which did so much mischief on the Sussex coast.

The church, which has long been hi ruins, was, in 1402, the home of an anchorite or hermit, one Thomas Bolle, who in that year obtained the Bishop's license to seclude himself from the outer world in a certain habitation on the north side of the churchyard. The prospects of Aldrington are rapidly improving, and there can be no doubt that within a few years the parish will become suburban to Brighton and Hove, and be eagerly sought after, not by recluses, but by persons of rank, fashion, and pleasure.

This is the most remarkable of the small towns of the eastern part of the South Down district, and has many claims on the attention of the arch\u00e6ologist. Its geographical situation is very pleasant, in a fertile valley sheltered by a range of the Downs. Through this valley passes the river Cuckmere, navigable a few miles to the northward.

British gold coins of the rarest types have been discovered here. Roman coins in"], [52, "6 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. considerable variety have also been brought to light ; but the most noticeable numismatic feature of the district is the well known \" Alfriston find \" of Anglo-Saxon pennies, by Mr. C. Ade, near Milton Court, in the adjacent parish of Arlington. The etymology of the name Alfriston has led to the notion that the place was founded by the patriot King. It is not, how ever Alfred's, but Alfric's, tun, as is clearly proved by the very words of Domesday, which assert that before the Conquest Alvric held Alvriceston (that is his enclosure or settlement) from Earl Godwin. Many barrows exist on the hills which surround this little town, and from these, from time to time, have been exhumed various British and Roman urns, and other remains of consider able interest. One of them, caUed the \" Long Barrow,\" from its resemblance to an inverted ship has been regarded as the grave of a Danish viking. There are several medieval remains of in terest in the town, particularly a mutilated market-cross, and an ancient inn called the Star, which has several antique carv ings in wood of the early part of the 16th century, representing St. George and the Dragon, St. Giles, the badge of St. Richard of Chiehester, and the supporters of the Dudleys, who, in the reign of Henry VII., had great influence in this part of Sussex. The church, dedicated to St. Andrew, is a large and handsome cruciform edifice of the 14th century, with a shingled spire ; it was formerly dependent on the neighbouring priory of Michelham. Though singularly devoid of monuments to the dead, it is of great architectural interest. The eastern win dow is one of the finest in the county. In the chancel are three sedilia and a piscina of remarkable form, and on the opposite side is an Easter sepulchre or founder's tomb. For fuller detads and opinions see Arch. Journ., v., 144, and Hussey's Churches.* In the churchyard are many altar-tombs to the Woodhams and other families, and a simple head-stone commemorates the fact that John Lower (born 1 735) was the first person who navigated the httle river Cuckmere with barges. Close to the church is an ancient vicarage of post and panel, a specimen of the lowly abodes with which our pre-Reformation clergy often contented themselves. Of the six bells in the tower, the only one that is ancient is dedicated to St. Augustine. Among the distinguished inhabitants of this parish were Thomas Chowne, of Frogfirle, a lay theologian, who died in 1639, and his descendant of the same name, whose valuable collections relating to Sussex perished by an accidental fire which destroyed his mansion in 1765.

Date of earliest Parish Register, 1560. Acreage, 2,900. In the \"Sussex Collections,\" vol. xvii., there is an ex haustive account of this interesting parish by the Rev. G. A. Clarkson. The river Arun divides it from Houghton, its ancient chapelry, at Houghton bridge, close to the railway station. A portion of the parish, including the loug, straggling, and picturesque viUage, lies on somewhat elevated ground, where also the castle and church are situated ; the lower portion is known as the \" Amberley Wild Brooks \" or marshes. The Arun here yields the trout celebrated by Izaak Walton and others. The manor dates from a very early period, and was an appendage to the see of Selsey. At the compilation of Domesday, the Bishop held it, and down to the present day it belongs, through a long succession of leases, to the see of Chiehester. Many of the Bishops had their temporary residence here, and John de Langton (Ex-chancellor of Edward II.,) who came to the see in 1305, greatly added to the earlier Norman structure."], [54, "8 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Bishop Rede, in 1379, fortified it with great walls and a massive gateway as it now stands. In 1447 additional defences for the castle were authorized, with power to empark 2,000 acres of wood in Amberley and the neighbourhood. Bishop Sherburne, the great benefactor to the see of Chiehester, added much to the ornamentation of this venerable place by remodelling several apartments, amongst which is the celebrated Queen's Room, so called from its having formerly been ornamented with portraits on wood of celebrated queens and heroines of antiquity. Some of these in tolerable preservation still remain. They are attributed by some to Bernardi, the Italian artist, who painted the \" kings and queens \" in the south transept of Chiehester Cathedral. Tradition asserts that the castle was plundered and dismantled by Waller during the civil wars, but it is more probable that it fell into gradual decay from ordinary causes and neglect. Of the Castle, which in shape approaches a parallelogram, the outer walls remain ; each angle formerly had a tower con structed internally. On the north the marshes formed a sufficient defence, but on the south there was a broad moat, which was crossed by a causeway and drawbridge, to the great gateway flanked by two segmental towers. Many of the internal buildings have been removed, and the existing ones form a con venient farm-house and offices. The Church (St. Michael) is probably coeval with the episcopal manor house itself. It retains a few good Norman windows. The chancel arch is semicircular, and has rich and peculiar mouldings. The chancel was built by Bishop Neville, probably about 1230. The south aisle and tower may have been added about the same time. There is a brass for 3Jol)cmnrs iSSHantelf , 1424, with a surcoated figure ; arms, three lions'1 heads langued. Near the pulpit is a stand for an hour glass, by which the Puritan clergy were wont to regulate the length of their sermons. At Rackham, in this parish, there was formerly a chapel. In allusion to the former muddy and marshy state of the parish,it was a common jest against the people of Amberley that they were web-footed ! \" The difference between Amberley in its winter and summer dress is expressed hi the local saying, which makes the Winter reply to ' Where do you belong ?'

The name appears to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon, Apuldre, an apple-tree (a common land-mark in former times), and ham, an abode. It lies on the estuary of the Lavant, on a level ground. It was part ofthe possessions of Battle A bbey from the reign of Henry I. to the Dissolution. It was leased to the family of Wakehurst till the reign of Henry VI., and sub sequently to that of Ryman. One of the latter family erected a tower here, called Ryman's Tower, a portion of what he had intended to make a castellated residence. But, according to Camden, a royal prohibition prevented his design, upon which R. Ryman employed the materials which he had collected in building the detached bell-tower at the north-west corner of the churchyard of Chiehester Cathedral, which has always been known as Ryman's Tower. The tower at Appledram is square, and about 45 feet in height, and with the surrounding lands belongs to Geo. Barttelot, Esq., of Stopham. The church, which was formerly a prebend in the .College of Bosham, is dedicated to St. Mary. It consists of a chancel and nave ofthe 13th century, and a south aisle and chantry of later date. The chancel, which is elaborately finished within, is a most interesting specimen of the period. At the west end of the nave is a dove-cote belfry, with two bells dedicated re spectively to St. Mary and the Holy Trinity. Adjacent to the sea at the southern extremity of the parish there was a large manufacture of salt, which has only been dis continued witl dn the last quarter of a century. At one period the"], [56, "10 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. salt obtained here sold for as much as a guinea a bushel. From its excessive dearness, the smuggling of salt was largely practised. Copperas Point was a well known place for landing contraband goods, and Mr. Arnold informs us that armed bands of horsemen, sometimes to the number of 400, bore off the spoil with greater or less impunity.

This parish lies upon the Forest Ridge of the Weald, and is beautifully diversified with sylvan scenery, the woodland amount ing to 1,000 acres. The ancient estate of Wakehurst gave name to the distinguished family of De Wakehurst, one of whom, Richard de Wakehurst, is said to have been knighted by Edward I., at the siege of Carlaverock. In his descendants Wakehurst continued until the 15th century, when it was carried by a co-heiress to the family of Culpeper, who held it for eight generations. Wakehurst Place, built by Sir Edw. Culpeper, in 1590, was an Elizabethan mansion of the first class, but within the last 30 years the great wings have been much reduced in length. That which still remains, however, is very interesting, and is fully described by Mr. Blaauw, in the \" Sussex Collec tions,\" vol. x. The church comprises a chancel, nave, south aisle, and porch, with a square western tower. It is chiefly in the Decorated style, and of considerable architectural interest. There are many monuments in the chancel. One by the north wall with a recumbent female figure, without inscription, probably com memorates the foundress. On an altar -tomb are the brasses of fotrijart and \u00a9lijalirti) 2123afecf)UtSt, 1457 & 1464. On the floor are brasses for iKtCMJjatli (tfulpcpt & JJlarflarft his wife, (the"], [57, "11 ARLINGTON. co-heiress of Wakehurst, 1509). Also for Jitcfjolas & (JMifalMJetf) \u00a9., his wife, the other co-heiress, 1510. Besides the figures ofthe parents, ten sons and eight daughters are represented. There are also brasses for \u00a9leaflets) (it., 1633, and for another ffilt?. (ft., a child, 1634, and other monuments. In one of the windows is the coat of De Warenne, and in the opposite one Or, a lion ramp. Gu., of the 14th century. A Roman road ran through this parish. Iron-works formerly existed here. The main stream of the river Ouse rises on the western borders of Wake burst park. Hapstead is a hamlet of this parish. A large school _has recently been established here for the education of boys ofthe \"lower middle class,\" on \"Anglican\" principles, in connection with the establishments at Hurst- Pierpoint, Shoreham, Lancing, &c.

This straggling parish lies on the river Cuckmere, and nowhere reaches any considerable width. It is upwards of eight miles in length, and extends from a point near Horsebridge to Jevington Holt, on the South Downs. Its boundary line touches no less than twelve other parishes. It includes that part of the Dicker known as Upper Dicker. Michelham Priory (see that article), stands within its bmits, as does Milton Street, a considerable hamlet towards the Downs. Milton Court, an ancient manor, which formerly had a chapel, pays tithes to the vicar of Wilmington, and consequently the inhabitants of the hamlet have right of sepulture at Wilmington. It was in a cottage garden here that the remarkable discovery of Saxon pennies known as the \"Alfriston find\" was made. The coins"], [58, "12 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. range from about 50 years prior to the Conquest to the time of Edward the Confessor. To his reign about 50 varieties belong, of various mints and moneyers, some having been struck at Chiehester, Lewes, and Hastings. Near this spot, on an elevated site, overlooking the river Cuckmere, formerly stood a forti fication known as Burlough Castle, a few faint traces of which remained within memory. Of its date and history nothing is known. Sessingham, in this parish, is mentioned in Domesday as having possessed a mill : at a later date it gave name to a family. Claverham, the Claveham of Domesday, a moated house, was long a seat of the Fyneses, a branch of the Hurst- Monceux family, and now belongs to the Shoosmiths. The church, which is situated remote from the principal part of the population, is dedicated to St. Pancras. It consists of a nave and chancel, with a north aisle and shorter chancel. The tower, which is lower than the ridge of the roof, has a shingled spire. There are Early English and Decorated features ; also several slabs with crosses. In the church and churchyard are memorials to the families of Page, Read, and Mason. At the south side of the churchyard once stood a chapel attached to the prebend of Woodhome, in Chiehester Cathedral. Abbot's Wood, the favourite resort of botanists and entomologists, was, from the time of Henry I. to the Dissolution, dependent upon Battle Abbey, and has ever since belonged to the family of Gage. At Upper Dicker there is a district church, erected about 1840. It contains a tablet to the memory of Dr. Vidal, bishop of Sierra Leone, who had previously been the incumbent. Altogether, few rural parishes in East Sussex contain so many features of interest as this does. [S. A. C. Domesday watermill, v, 272. Fynes family, xi, 74. Cul peper family, xii, 157.

This ancient and grandly historical town is one of the most"], [59, "13 ARUNDEL. interesting on the southern coast. It derives its name from its situation on the river Arun.* Its aspect is very noble and picturesque. Indeed it has been the subject of many beautiful paintings and illustrations of every kind. Its history has been frequently written, and for full particulars,\" which it would be impossible to compress within the narrow space of these volumes, we must refer to Dallaway and Cartwright's History of the Rape of Arundel (1832), and to the still more elaborate work of the Rev. M. A. Tierney, in two volumes (1834). \" The honour of Arundel,\" as Dallaway truly states, \" for its antiquity, extent, and dignity, is the most remarkable in England. To enquire whether it was occupied as a distinguished station by our primeval ancestors, or whether it was a Roman encampment with a pr\u00e6torial territory, might open a very wide field for con jecture.\" It is a common error that Arundel is mentioned in King Alfred's will. This is not the case ; for the place referred to in that document has been proved to be Crondel in Hamp shire. It was one of the numerous possessions of Earl Godwin and his unfortunate son Harold. After the Conquest it was given by William to Roger de Montgomeri, under the title of the Earldom of Arundel, which was commensurate with the rapes of Arundel and Chiehester, and was estimated at above 58,000 acres. Three mesne Lordships, Halnaker, Petworth, and Midhurst, 10 Hundreds, 18 parks, and 25 manors surrounded the castle in every direction within the limits of West Sussex. Thus it became almost the greatest feudal dignity in England. In Domesday it is stated to have been possessed of a mill (pro bably on the site of the mill well known to the lovers of art from Constable's picture), three highways, and one pasture, custom of ships, \u00a313, and a fishery. Roger De Montgomeri, Earl Marshal of England, enjoyed the favour ofthe Conqueror, but his son and successor, Robert, siding with Duke Robert, forfeited his English possessions, which Henry I. granted to his brother Hugh. Soon afterwards Henry I. seized the earldom, and by his will settled it as dowry upon Adeliza or Alice of Loraine, his second wife. She re-married William de Albini, who had been Pincerna Regis or king's butler. In the family of De Albini it remained till the time of the 5th Earl of Arundel, who died in 1243, leaving four sisters, in consequence of which the Honour was divided into four parts. The Honour was assigned to Fitz-Alan who had married Isabel, the second co-heiress, and he assumed the earldom by tenure only, and was ancestor of seven Earls of Arundel in a direct line of succession, down to the death of Thomas Fitz-Alan, in 1415. In that year a claim was made by John de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, son * \" Arun, which doth name tho beauteous Arundel.\" Drayton, Polyolb."], [60, "14 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. and heir of John's sister Elizabeth, and after a Chancery suit full possession was given to John Fitz-Alan, Baron Maltravers, in 1433. Subsequently it was held in succession by the united families of Fitz-Alan and Maltravers till the death of Earl Henry, in 1579. His only son dying a minor, his younger daughter Mary was the first wife of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. Philip Howard was summoned to Parliament by tenure of the Castle only. The attainder of Philip, Earl of Arundel, in 1584, led to the seizure of the Honour by Queen Elizabeth ; but his son Thomas, second Earl of the Howard family, was restored to his posses sions in 1609. In that family it has remained, with all its vast territories, down to the present day. Of the origin of the Castle nothing is known. If we ask the question, who was its original founder? \" Oblivion laughs and says : The prey is mine.\" Domesday Book mentions the existence of a Castle here be fore the Conquest. The herring-bone masonry of its older walls has induced some antiquaries to believe that they are of Saxon work ; but this is no safe criterion. The circumference of the building, not including the outworks, is oblong, 950 feet long bv 250 feet wide, and encloses 5^ acres. The walls are from five to twelve feet thick, and the ground plan resembles that of Windsor Castle. Its circular Keep is raised on a mound partly natural, but more artificial, in the style of many fortresses both in England and Normandy. The walls, which are strengthened with buttresses, are from eight to ten feet thick. Beneath it is a small subterraneous room, and above it formerly stood an oratory dedicated to St. Martin. This keep was flanked by an oblong tower, guarded by a portcullis, in which was the present entrance, approached by a long flight of steps. By these steps and a sallyport it is connected with the great gate way. It has a plain circular arch under a square tower, contain ing two chambers of state, in which the Empress Maude is traditionally said to have been received. The outward gateway was added in the reign of Edward I., and was fifty feet high. A full architectural description of this grand pile, as it anciently existed, would be beyond our scope. But we must mention, as a part of the legendary lore of Sussex, the tradition of the building known as Bevis' Tower having been occupied by that renowned giant when he consented to become warder to the Earls of Arundel. His weekly allowance of provisions con sisted of an ox, two hogsheads of beer, and bread and mustard ad libitum !"], [61, "15 ARUNDEL. His steed, \" Hirondelle,\" was thought to have given name to the town, the arms of which are still a swallow (Fr. Hirondelle, a swallow); and his great sword called \" Morglay\" was long pre served in the armoury of the castle. A mound in the park was considered as the giant's grave. In the great hall which stood on the western side of the court, Henry Fitz-Alan, the last Earl, gave lordly banquets. This hall and the castle generally suffered so greatly from the siege of 1643, from artillery placed on the tower of the church, that the noble proprietors seldom resided here until about 1716, when Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, erected a brick house within the area. In 1806 the remaining walls of the hall were removed. The chapel of St. George, founded on the S.W. side of the castle before 1275, was forty feet long, and remained till the edifice was partly rebuilt in 1796. It was to have been an establishment for six priests, but the funds were afterwards appropriated to the College of the Holy Trinity here after referred to. The military history of this renowned castle is minutely re corded in our chronicles. William Rufus, on his landing from Normandy, occupied it in 1097. There was a siege in 1102 by Henry I., when Robert de Belesme surrendered it to the King andretired hito Normandy, but the fortress suffered no detriment. In 1139 the Empress Maude, with her illegitimate brother, Robert Earl of Gloucester, landed at Littlehampton, and was received at the castle with great courtesy by Queen Adeliza,. King Stephen shortly after appeared with his forces before the castle, and demanded the person of the Empress, but after a time Maude was permitted to withdraw to Bristol. King Edward L visited this grand abode in 1302. For 500 years the castle was left in comparative peace. The second siege of Arundel Castle took place in December, 1643, by Sir William Waller, who, as Vicars says, \" Finding the castle gate shut fast, set a petard to the gate and blew it open ; and so most resolutely entered the castle.\" De tails of this memorable siege appear in Vol. xx. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" and still fuller in Dallaway's Rape of Arundel. See the account given in the former work, and the sad death of Sir Wm. Springett. Dugdale says that the castle was taken December 9th, 1643, and re-taken by Waller, January 6th, 1644. It is beyond our scope to give full particulars of the great families of Montgomeri, D'Albini, Fitz-Alan, and Howard ; but they may be found m DaUaway's elaborate History ofthe Rape of Arundel. He, anxious to do honour to his patron, Bernard- Edward, Duke of Norfolk, gives the minutest account of those families."], [62, "16 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Before the year 1786, when Duke Charles succeeded to the possession of this historical fortress, he determined to restore it. Mr. Francis Hiorne, of Warwick, an able architect, built a triangular tower in the Home Park, which still bears his name. The Duke spent the last 25 years of his life in this work of restoration ; but modern ideas of architecture can hardly excuse his want of skill or taste. It is certainly a noble mansion, but it was an unfortunate period for the restoration. There are, it is true, noble apartments. The library is 122 feet long, and the Barons' Hall is also of spacious dimensions, 70 feet by 34 feet, and more than 36 feet to the centre of the roof. The latter apartment contains 13 windows of painted glass of historical character ; the faces of the figures are portraits of different members of the Howard family. There are also many heraldric decorations. Arundel Castle abounds in family portraits and other pictures of more or less historical interest, but the one which will be sure to attract the observation ofthe visitor is that of Charles L, by Vandyke. It may be considered to be one of the finest works of that great master. To the northward of the castle, outside the earthworks, which are of very great depth, is the Little Park, surrounded by a perfect vallum. The ancient park is now a farm. About 1786 a new park was formed, measuring nearly 1200 acres, and well stocked with fine deer. This is one of the grandest parks in England. Roger de Montgomeri founded a Priory of four Monks, which he made dependent on his great abbey of Seez, in Normandy, but this small monastery was seized by Edward III. as an alien priory, during his wars with France. In 1380 Richard, Earl of Arundel, founded a College consisting of a master, twelve secular canons, three deacons, three sub-deacons, two acolytes, two sacrists, and seven choristers. The foundations were laid on the site of the dissolved priory. The building consisted of a quadrangle, including a refectory and a chapel annexed to the parish church. During the siege of 1643, the college buildings were much damaged, as the soldiery were quartered in it. It was a handsome edifice with painted windows, one of which contained a series of portraits of the ancient Earls of Arundel, with tabards of their coat-armour. At the dissolution, temp. Henry VIII., the possessions ofthe dissolved college were granted to the Earls of Arundel, and little more than the sepulchral chapel now exists. Towards the end of the last century the walls of the ancient chambers were refitted as a Roman Catholic chapel. The sepulchral chapel (more generally known as the College-"], [63, "17 ARUNDEL. chapel) contains some elaborate monuments and several brasses. The monument of Thomas Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, and his Countess Beatrix, stands in the middle of the choir. These noble persons are represented in alabaster, and the horned head dress of the Countess attracts the attention of every visitor. There is a plain altar-tomb to John Lord Maltravers, to whose memory this chapel was built by his mother Alianor. There is also an open feretrum of alabaster, with an emaciated naked figure beneath, and upon an upper slab is an effigy of John Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, in armour with the Fitz-Alan arms, and a collar of S.S. He was slain at the battle of Gerberoy, in 1432. Next we see, within a rich chantry on the south side of the chancel, a tomb of Sussex marble. At the west end ofthe lower stage there was an altar where prayers were said for the souls ofthe deceased. The figures, which lie loose on the tomb, are in free-stone, and as Dallaway observes, \" possess considerable merit, the draperies being executed in the angular style of Albert Durer.\" These figures are said to represent William, Earl of Arundel, who died in 1488, and Joan his wife. A lofty sacellum of beautiful work contains the bodies of Thomas, Earl of Arundel, K.G., who married Lady Margaret, one of the co heiresses of Richard Woodville, Earl Ryvers, sister of Elizabeth, wife of King Edward IV., who died in 1524, and William, also Earl of Arundel, K.G., who married Anne, daughter of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. This Earl died 35 Henry VIII. Next we have another sacellum of Sussex marble with an arcade and canopy, and pillars curiously sculptured. This is to the memory of William, Earl of Arundel, and his Countess. The other monuments are as follows : \u2014 A mural tablet to the Earl of Arundel, a soldier of considerable distinction, a courtier in the reigns of Queens Mary and Elizabeth, who died \" honore florens, labore fractus, \u00e6tate confectus,\" in 1579. There are many traces of ancient brasses, which during the long desertion of Arundel by its Earls were sacrilegiously removed ; but several still remain, and the inscriptions commemorate the fol lowing persons : \u2014 1. William Whyte, master of this college, 1430. 2. An esquire in armour, and his wife, representing Thomas Salmon, usher of the chamber to Henry V. 3. John Threele, who married Jane Barttelot. He died in J 465, and his wife in 1469. 4. Sir Adam Eartham, master of this college. 5. John Mundy, sub-master of the college, 1506. 6. Bust of a Priest, Esperaunce Blundell, rector of Sutton. 7. John Baker, Fellow of the college. 8. Robert Warde, 1459. Following the order of Mr. Dallaway, we find mural tablets : first, to Richard Lamplow, sometime carver, 1573; and second, to Robert Spiller, twenty-three years steward, to Anne, Countess of Arundel. c"], [64, "18 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The ancient church having fallen to decay in or about 1380, Richard Earl of Arundel rebuilt it on new foundations, so as to connect it with the College of the Holy Trinity. This noble man is understood, as Admiral of the High Seas, to have taken much merchandise from the French in 1345, and the money so procured he applied to rebuild the church, as well as to enlarge his castle. This is a fine, large, ancient church, consisting of a double arcade dividing the nave from the aisles, with a clerestory containing a row of circular windows enclosing quatrefoils. There is also a transept attached to the tower, which is low, and has a roof of lead painted white, as a landmark. The south transept has always been used as the parochial chancel. In the opposite one was the chantry of St. Christopher, called Salmon's, whose endowment consisted of the great tithes of Rudgwick. Edmund Mill, Esq., early in the 15th century, was the founder of this chantry. The building contains monuments to the names and families of Bubb, Byrch, Tootell, Morley, Cooper, Peckham, Vincent, Leeves, Mill, Fowler, Carleton, Albury, Gratwicke, Henley, Hughes, Bate, Tillier, Thorne, Carus, Carr, Hester, Holmes, Tompkins, Bushby, Seymour, Lane, Lady Sidney Kerr, L. D. P., non. Dec. 1829. (\"Innocens et perbeata more florum decidi ; quid viator fles sepultum ? flente sum felicior\"), Howard, and Cartwright. The Maison-Dieu was probably founded about the year 1380, and the object of the charity was to maintain twenty poor and aged men. The master was a clergyman, and Richard, third Earl of Arundel, endowed the establishment with a competent income. The building formed a small quadrangle, including a chapel. During the last siege, 1643, it was destroyed by Waller's soldiers. The borough of Arundel dates back to Domesday Book, and it probably existed in early Saxon times. It is a cor poration, and the seal has a swallow \u2014 a pun upon the name of the town, from the French Hirondelle. The borough sent mem bers to Parliament from the reign of Edward I., but its popu lation not being sufficient for the return of representatives it is now disfranchised. The Bridge is supposed to have been either built or consider ably repaired by Queen Adeliza, who made a road called Calce tum, about a mile in length, and founded the Priory de Calceto. It is a handsome structure of three arches. The port of Arundel is mentioned in the time of the Confessor. The haven has been greatly improved within the present century, and now carries on a considerable trade. \" In point of regularity of building and neatness,\" observes Dallaway, \" no town in this county is superior to Arundel. It"], [65, "19 ARUNDEL. is sheltered from the north by the park and woods, and lies open to the south-west, commanding from the higher points an extensive sea view at about five miles distance.\" A splendid Roman Catholic Church, of cathedral-like size is in course of erection, chiefly at the expense of the Duke of Norfolk, who contributes the munificent sum of \u00a350,000. It is not generally understood that that well-known sporting book, the \" Racing Calendar,\" which now occupies upwards of 900 pages, was projected by Mr. John Cheney, of Arundel, and first published in 1726, in the shape of a small pamphlet. This person tells us in his preface that he \" travelled the kingdom over \" to obtain his information. It is a curious fact that in one of Mr. Cheney's earliest calendars we find among his patrons no less than twenty Dukes, twenty-four Earls, thirteen Viscounts, twenty-eight Barons, and eighty Baronets. Racing in those days was for about \u00a310, and it is a characteristic fact that in the bulky volume of the present day, Weatherby's sub scribers to his \" Racing Calendar \" include only seven Dukes, twenty-three Earls, three Viscounts, eleven Barons, and less than thirty Baronets. Racing in those early days of the \"Turf\" was simply an equine competition among the noble and gentle men of the kingdom, and the gambling which now disgraces this pastime, and leads many to ruin, was unknown a hundred and fifty years ago.

The surface is undulating, and being well wooded, the views are charming. This place is said to have belonged to the ancestors of the present noble proprietor before the Conquest. In 1 066 Bertram de Ashburnham, son of Anchitel, son of Piers, was Constable of Dover Castle, and held out against William, for which act he was beheaded. His descendants, however, have con tinued at this place, with a brief interval in the 1 7th century, down to the present time, although De Criol, a Norman, is named as the lord in Domesday book. John Ashburnham, the true but misrepresented friend of Charles I., was in his time head of the family. In 1689, his grandson, of the same name, was elevated to the peerage, by William III., as Baron Ash burnham. Ashburnham House, a mansion of considerable extent, is of rather modern date, and contains the finest private collec tion of printed books and MSS. in England; the MSS., parti cularly, \" so far as the Latin and European languages go, is perhaps the most splendid display of ancient literature ever brought together by a subject.\" (Murray.) These, together with many antiquities and works of art, are inaccessible to the general public. The deer park surrounding the mansion is truly delectable. The church, dedicated to St. James, was built about the year 1665, by John Ashburnham, and is of the style known as \" debased Gothic.\" The tower, however, is in the Per pendicular style, and has the well-known \"Pelham Buckle.\" There are some elaborate monuments to the Ashburnhams. In this church were formerly kept some relics of Charles I., includ ing the shirt in which he was beheaded, his watch, silk drawers, &c, which had been preserved by the loyalty of John Ashburn ham. They are now at Ashburnham House. Ashburnham was once famous for its iron-works, which were carried on on a small scale so lately as the year 1825. The iron of this district excelled in the quality of toughness, and was in no wise inferior to the Swedish metal, generally reckoned the best in the world. [S. A. C.

This district, which covers an area of about 13,000 acres, chiefly in the parishes of Maresfield, Hartfield, and Withyham, but also extending into those of East Grinstead, Fletching, and Buxted, once formed a portion of that great forest which was known to our Celtic predecessors as Andredswald, and to the Romans as Sylva Anderida. It extended from the county of Kent, through the whole of the Weald of Sussex, towards Hampshire, and measured 120 miles in length. It has, like the other five Sussex forests, succumbed to the hewer of wood and the tiller of the soil, so that with the exception of a few patches of forest land here and there, it, with its neighbours, has lost its distinctive character of a forest altogether. Bede, writing in 731, describes the whole of Anderida as all but inaccessible, and the resort of large herds of deer, and of wolves, and wild boars. The Rev. Edward Turner has, in Vol. xiv. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" p. 35 to 64, given an able outline of the history of Ashdown. Traces of early occupation have been found in an ancient British boat or canoe, 30 feet long ; in the Roman remains of iron-works at Oldland in Maresfield; andin ahoard of Anglo-Saxon coins dis- covered in a peat bog near Duddleswell. In the later Saxon and earlier Norman times, from its being a prominent portion of the Rape of Pevensey, it was known as the forest of Pevensel. Few ash-trees are found in the locality, wherefore we should probably look for the etymology of the first syllable in \u00c6sc, a leader or chief, which word was afterwards used as a proper name. (See Bosworth.) Our forest, though obscure as to its his- tory, still possesses much to gratify the geologist, the botanist, and the lover of the picturesque. The descent of the ownership of Ashdown from the Conquest, for a long series of years, is the same as that ofthe honour or barony of Pevensey. (See Pevensey) . From the time of Edward I. to that of Edward ill., it vested in the Crown, and in 1377 the latter monarch granted it to his third son John of Gaunt, and from that time it was frequently known as Lancaster Great Park or free chase. A palace or hunting-lodge, supposed to have been built by Edward II. , stood in a wood called the Vetchery. That monarch certainly dated some deeds at his palace of Maresfield. Edward III. and John of Gaunt also frequented this place for sporting purposes, and a place near Duddleswell is still called \" King-standing-hill,\""], [68, "22 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. probably a post of observation for the royal sportsmen. A chapel was bkewise founded about half-a-mile west of the village of Nutley ; it occupied an eminence, and the site is still pointed out by the name of \" Chapel-wood.\" It was called the free chapel of Maresfield, and the chaplain possessed certain rights in the forest. The great Reformer John Wycliffe is said to have performed duty in it, when he was compelled to seek re tirement and the protection of his patron, John of Gaunt. This chapel, which was called Notley, was in disuse before the year 1541, when the chalice and vestments belonging to it were transferred to the church of Maresfield. The font was discovered by Mr. Turner some years since, and was then used as a trough in a cow-yard. Another foundation called Dudeney chapel is said to have stood near Duddleswell, but of its existence there remains no historical evidence. Iron-works foimerly existed in this forest. The forest was anciently divided into South-ward, West-ward, and Costlye-ward ; it had a bailiff, a master of the forest, a parker, and several rangers, verdurers, &c. There were \" walks\" called Pippingford, Hindleap, Broad-stone, Coombe-dean, White-dean, and Duddleswell, and the ancient enclosure or park pale, though long since destroyed, may still be pretty well traced by the names of the entrances ; as Forest-gate, Prickett's-hatch, and Braby's -hatch, in Maresfield; Clay-gate, Barnes'-gate, and Crowboro'-gate, in Buxted; Fisher's-gate, and Tye's-gate, in Withyham ; Coleman's-hatch, and Chuck-hatch, in Hartfield ; Plaw-hatch, in East Grinstead ; and Chelworth-gate, in Fletch ing. Large herds of deer and horses were kept in the park, and the black grouse found a home among the heather. Frequent devastations among the timber and deer were committed, for many generations, and numerous royal commissions were consequently issued. The locality was infamous even down to a somewhat recent date for the deeds of poachers, horse-stealers, and smug glers, so that \" Forester,\" became almost a synonym for rogue and vagabond. [S. A.

In the 14th century the manor belonged to the Coverts, and so continued until the extinction of the elder bne ofthe family in the 17th. It now belongs to the Duke of Norfolk. Another portion of the parish was purchased by the Burrell family. Lands were also held by the family of Wolf, who gave name to the manor of West Wolves. The church, which is dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul (or to our Lady and St. Peter), is a small building of the 15th century, and contains some painted glass ; it has a low, shingled spire. In 1591, on one of her progresses, Queen Elizabeth passed through Ashington. An account of her visit was inscribed in the Parish Register, which was stolen during a law-suit in the early part of the 18th century, and has never been recovered. It was abstracted from the rector's cupboard through a hole made on the outside of his lath-and- plaster mansion. (Cartwright.) See Buncton, chapelry of. [S. A. C. Queen Elizabeth, v, 197.

The manor, together with a farm called Hawking-Sopers, has descended as Wiston to the Rev. John Goring. The farm is said to derive its name from one Soper, falconer to the Lord of Wiston. At Wiston there is an old picture of the Lord going forth a-hawking, attended"], [70, "24 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. by an ancient man with a falcon on his fist, presumed to be this Master Soper. The principal estate in the parish is Etons, which extends into Henfield, and is the Etune of Domesday. The manor has been in the families of Shelley, Caryll, Grat wick, and Campion. Peppers was the estate of the family of Bridger, who afterwards settled at Combe, in Hamsey, and whose heiress married Sir George Shiffner, created a Baronet in 1818. The impropriation belonged to the Abbey of Fecamp, in Nor mandy, which had a chapel here. The church has a nave, chancel, and south aisle, portions of which are Early English.

The principal estate in the parish is Nelond, Nyland, or Nay land, now Balcombe Place. It passed respectively through the old families of Michelborne, Culpeper, and Spence (afterwards of South Mailing), and then through the Liddels and Clitherows to the Chatfields, whose representatives sold it to the present proprietor, J. A. Hankey, Esq., High Sheriff of Sussex in 1866. Mr. Hankey has erected a fine mansion in the Tudor style on a commanding spot, near the ancient house, of which little now remains except a massive chimney-stack. Nelond formerly gave name to a family, from which sprang Thomas Nelond, Prior of Lewes in 1459, whose fine brass is in Cowfold church. An ancient house called Stone-hall, now attached to the estate, was the residence of the Brays. The rectory house is an elegant manse, with 69 acres of glebe. The church, dedicated to St. Mary, consisted of a tower with a low spire at the west end, and a nave and chancel with Early English features ; but it has been largely added to and restored.

It was here that that tremendous con flict known as the Battle of Hastings took place in 1066, between the Normans and the Saxons. Of the early history of this place, previously to the Conquest, little is known. Most of what has been collected respecting it will be found in an article by the Rev. Edw. Turner, in the \"Sussex Collections,\" and in the \" Chronicon de Bello,\" of which my translation appeared in 1851. There has been a foolish notion that the place was called Senlac ; but for this name there is no manner of authority. I have stated in the translation my belief, that at the time of the Battle the site of the present town was a mere rough plain. It is said in the Saxon Chronicle that this dire conflict took place at the \"Hoary Apple-tree\" (cet thcere haran apuldran), and it must be recollected that our ancestors were much in the habit of naming localities from trees of a peculiar or venerable nature.* Limitations as to space compel me to omit all political refer- ences to the causes and ultimate consequences of this great fight, and therefore my effort is to be as brief as possible, for, laboro esse brevis has been my motto as to this \" Compendious \" book. I shall therefore state as simply as I can, in this place, \"she ascertained facts required of the local historian, and shall be- gin with the main particulars. The Norman fleet set forth for the Conquest of England, from St. Valery, at the mouth of the Somme in Picardy, 25 miles N. E. of Dieppe, in a direction nearly S. S. E. of Hastings. At Pevensey, and to the eastward, this great armament reached our shores. There are conflicting statements as to the debarcation of the Normans, but the words of the Bayeux Tapestry are conclusive, \" Here Duke William in a great ship crossed the sea and came to Pevensey.\" The Chronicle of Battle Abbey, with like positiveness, asserts that the landing was at Pevensey (\"prope castrum Pevenesel dictum \"). From that point the troops marched on to Hastings in order * See remarks in Vol vi. of S. A. C . The Abbey was originally proposed to be built at a place called Herst, to the westward of the site ultimately selected, and a certain thorn-tree is adduced by the author of the Chronicon as a memorial of the circumstance. See as to trees as Laudiuurk., Arch\u00e6ologia, Vol. xxv."], [75, "29 BATTLE OE BATTEL. to steal food (\" ut cibum raperentur\"). Casting aside the tradi tion that William dined upon a rock called the \" Conqueror's Table,\" between the two places, the next incident of the invasion is, that the future King directed a castle, that is an earth work, to be dug or cast up at Hastings ; for it would be absurd to imagine that the castle of masonry which we now behold was built for the temporary accommodation of a great army, which it could not possibly have contained. In this both the Tapestry and the Chronicon de Bello agree. The former shows a wooden erection, and the latter expressly says that William ligneum castellum. munivit. Hence we must look to a later epoch for the erection of Hastings castle. Another tradition that William burnt his fleet, in order to cut off all hope of his followers' return to the Continent, is much better supported, and the Chronicon plainly asserts the fact. For fifteen days the Norman army appear to have subsisted upon food pillaged from the neigh bouring places ; and Domesday Book shows how, twenty years later, those places had depreciated in value.* And now we arrive at perhaps the greatest event recorded in our national annals. Many attempts have been made in recent times to describe the Battle of Hastings, but mostly with little success, writers having foUo wed previous authors in a most blind and careless manner. Some years ago I had the labour, or rather the pleasure, of collecting every known fact relating to this grand conflict, which destroyed one dynasty and introduced another. I confined myself to authorities which appeared within a- century of the event, and therefore it is probable that the statements made are trustworthy. William landed at Pevensey on 'Sept. 28th, 1066, and on October 14th, a fortnight later, this terrible fight took place. The invading army left Hastings on the 1 3th of October, when Harold hastened to meet it on the heights of Battle, and there fixed his gonfanon, and entrenched himselt-in a well-chosen position. He had the place well examined, and surrounded by a ditch. Upon the vallum his soldiers erected a barricade com posed of their shields, and of wood from the adjacent forests, so as to form a very strong wall. Within this extempore fortress were assembled the men of London, Kent, Hertford, Essex, Surrey, Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk, and many others, who were loyal to the cause of Harold. Villagers were called in from the neighbourhood, armed with such weapons as \" clubs, and great picks, iron forks, and stakes.\" The Saxon army is said to have resembled that of a victorious host, little dreaming of to morrow's overthrow. They drank, danced, and sang, and shouted * These matters have been more fully discussed in my paper ou the \"Landing,\" in S. A. C, Vol. ii."], [76, "30 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. loud wassails. The Normans, on the contrary, spent the night in prayers and in confessing their sins, in portable chapels which the priests had provided, where they sang psalms and holy litanies. At daybreak, Bishop Odo celebrated high mass, and pronounced a solemn benediction. \" The line of the Normans' march, from their camp at Hastings to the battle-field, must have lain on the south-western slope of the elevated ridge of land extending from Fairlight to Battle ; that is, to the north of the village of Hollington, through what is now Crowhurst Park, to the elevated spot, then called Hetheland, but now known as Telham Hill. This district, which is even at the present day encumbered with woods, must have presented many obstacles to the advance of a multitudinous army ; but every possible means to facilitate their movements had been employed, and early on the morning of the fatal 14th of October, they stood upon the heights of Telham, in full view of the Saxon camp, more than a mile distant.\" At that point the Duke marshalled his forces into three co lumns of attack. The first consisted of cavalry from Boulogne and Ponthieu, with other mercenaries ; the second was composed of auxiliaries from Brittany, Nantes, and Poitou, while the Duke in person led on the flower of the army, his own Norman subjects. The' invaders are represented on the Bayeux Tapestry, some as wearing mail, and others in their ordinary costume, their arms being heavy swords, maces, and spears ; they carry large kite- shaped shields, and some are armed, as we learn from another source, with balist\u00e6 or crossbows. They did not arm until they arrived within sight of the Saxon camp. William happened to have his mail presented to him the wrong way fore most, which some protested was an unhappy omen. Against this notion the Duke set his face,and proceeded to arm, declaring at the same time that, if God would vouchsafe him the victory he would found a monastery on the field of battle as an asylum for his saints, and as a succour for the men who should be there slain. Upon this, William Faber, a monk of Marmoutier near Tours, suggested that this abbey should be dedicated to St. Martin, the military patron of France, to which the Duke as sented. Then the mighty Norman thrice offered conditions of peace, which not being accepted, the battle commenced. Upon the hill where now the abbey stands the English supported Harold in a compact body. The Duke not being successful in his first attack, feigned a retreat. The English pursued the Normans, but the Normans turned upon them, and they were thus hemmed in on both sides. Multitudes of each army fell. Between the hostile armies lay what is by the Chronicler's exaggeration walled a dreadful precipice named Malfosse, or the \" bad ditch,\" into which the pursuers and pursued alike fell, to their dreadful"], [77, "31 BATTLE OR BATTEL. loss, amounting even on the Conqueror's side to 10,000 men. The locality is known in later documents as Manfosse, but the notion of the \" dreadful precipice \" is hardly reconcilable with existing geographical features. Nothing, says the Chronicler, was to be seen but the red hue of blood, and the dales around sent forth a gory stream which at length increased to the size of a river ! Cr\u00e6dat Jud\u00e6us : and let all the more recent writers on this great fight well consider what they mean in speaking of the street of Battle, now called \" the Lake,\" as the site of this bloody stream or pool. It was spelt, directly after the Conquest, \" Santlache,\" whatever that means ; it certainly does not sig nify \" the pool of blood.\" Neither does Telham-hill mean the place where William \" told 'em,\" that is, counted his men, any more than Caldbeck, true Anglo-Saxon for a cold spring, means the spot where the Conqueror \" called back \" his men. Howbeit it was on the very place where Harold received the Norman arrow in his eye, and dying, \"leaned upon his shield,\" that the famous monastery, perhaps the greatest of our historical monuments, now stands. The high altar was placed on the identical spot where \" Harold Infelix \" fell, and that spot is to-day the frequent resort of the lover of English story. The statement that the body of the slain monarch, discovered among the dead by the fair Edith of the swan's neck, was carried to his abbey of Walt ham is mere fable, for he was certainly buried on the heights of Hastings beneath a stone, insolently inscribed : \u2014 \" By the order of the Duke, you rest here King Harold, as the guardian of the shore and the sea.\" \" Per mandata Ducis, Rex hie Heralde, quiescis, Ut custos maneas litoris et pelagi.\" For fuller details of this tremendous conflict which saw \" England lost, and England won,\" I must refer to my article printed in Vol. vi. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" in which I col lected every scrap of information that could be obtained, strictly limiting myself to works written within a century of the event itself.* Much has been written before and since, with so much of romance intermingled with the truth, that most of the writers are unsafe guides. As to Battle Abbey, the memorial of this great conflict, its origin, progress, and downfall, the reader cannot do better than peruse the elaborate paper by the Rev. Edw. Turner, in Vol. xvii. of the \" Sussex Collections.\" The Conqueror, true to his vow, proceeded, as early as circumstances would permit him, to lay the foundations of a stately church and abbey, to the honour of the * This article has since been printed in \" Contributions to Literature.\""], [78, "32 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. t Trinity, St. Mary, and St. Martin. The progress however was but slow, and a temporary church with a few mean dwellings for the shelter of four monks, was erected, until the more exten sive and permanent edifice should be constructed. In 1076, Robert Blanchard, a monk of Marmoutier, was appointed first Abbot. The establishment was originally intended for 140 monks ; but that number was never reached. At first the brethren sought a different site from that which William had decided upon, urging that the soil was sterile and lacked water. The strong-willed Conqueror, however, stood firm to his deter mination that the abbey should be erected on the very spot where Harold's standard had fallen. At first there was a diffi culty about materials for the building, and ships were sent to Normandy to fetch Caen stone. Soon, however, it was revealed to a religious matron of Battle, in a dream, that there was plenty of good stone to be found close at hand ; and accordingly the building was chiefly constructed of the stone of the country.* Among the original benefactions was William's grant of a ter ritory called the leuga, which surrounded the abbey, and extended, as is conjectured, over a space 1^ mile in radius. Without the ambit of the abbey, there soon sprang up, on what had previously been a barren waste, a number of buildings for the abode of artisans and others dependent on the establishment ; and this appears to have been the germ of the existing town of Battle. The tenants were called burgesses, and had three guild, or brotherhood, halls for social purposes. The leuga was divided into five \" boroughs,\" Middleboro', Uckham, Santlake, Montjoy, and Telham. There were also several out-boroughs in neigh bouring parishes. William died before the completion of his Abbey, and the honour of its consecration was reserved for his son Rufus, who was here in great pomp and splendour in Feb ruary, 1095. Among those present at the ceremony were Arch bishop Anselm, and seven other prelates, the great Barons of the realm, and a large concourse of clergy and laity. On this occasion the King conferred on the monastery the advowsons of several churches, and the Conqueror's rich pallium or royal robe in which he had been crowned. It was ornamented with amulets and costly gems. He also handed over a feretory, or portable altar, upon which his father had been accustomed to hear mass said ; and last, but not least, the very sword which the Con queror had used in the battle. The buildings formed an immense pile, probably of quadrangular form. Browne Willis, however, must be in error in stating that they were \" no less than a mile i about.\" At present they are not of very large extent. The enclosure is entered from the main street of the town through a majestic gateway beneath a square tower, having at"], [79, "33 BATTLE OR BATTEL. each angle an octagon turret, and on each side a long wing. The whole facade is very noble. This portion of the existing remains is chiefly of the 15th century, though the iuner, or lawn side retains traces of Norman work. Opposite this gateway is a range of low parallel walls, the space between which is a ter race walk, but which was originally a range of cells for the monks. At the end are two high turrets, of later date than the gateway. At right angles with this is the dwelling-house, the only portion, with the exception of what has been mentioned, which is not in ruins. The great hall is 57ft. by 31ft., with a lofty open roof. To the left of the hall is a large Gothic saloon, with a double-vaulted roof, supported in the centre by an arcade. Eastward of this part of the ancient abbey stood the refectory, 150 feet long. It is now roofless, and is of the 12th century. Under this is a crypt, the roof of which is supported by a double arcade. No remains of the ancient kitchen exist ; and of the site even of the great church no certain knowledge existed until Sir Godfrey Webster, about 1817, caused excavations to be made which plainly showed its position and size. The exact site of the high altar now \" hangs in air ;\" but the walls and piers of a crypt beneath it with piscin\u00e6 and niches belonging to three underground chapels are still preserved. The tower anciently possessed a goodly peal of bells, but of course both are now gone. The residents of the leuga formerly attended service in this church ; but in the early part of the 12th century a separate parochial church, the present St. Mary, was provided for them outside the walls. The privilege of sanctuary was granted to every criminal who could reach this abbey church and kneel before its high altar. The almonry of the establishment stood outside the gateway, and had a separate endowment. The abbots of Battle were \" mitred,\" that is, had a seat in Parlia ment, with many privileges, including the right to pardon any criminal whom they might meet on his way to execution. They were also exempt from episcopal jurisdiction, and many and frequent were the squabbles between the Abbots and Bishops of Chiehester on this subject in the 12th century, as may be seen at length in the Chronicon de Bello. To enumerate the vast possessions of this abbey would far exceed our limits ; but the great Manor of Wye, in Kent, with its independent jurisdiction, and that of Alciston, in Sussex (43\u00a3 hides), where the abbots had a manse, were prominent. The Priories of Brecknock, in Wales, and St. Nicholas at Exeter, were subordinate to the abbey. When the abbot went in great state to Parliament, he had his \"inn\" or town residence near St. Olaves, in Tooley street, which gave name to \"Battle-bridge,\" still retained. The abbey had three parks, a vineyard, and ample stewponds. The D"], [80, "34 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. monastery received several visits from royalty. That of Rufus has been already mentioned. The restless John was here several times, and once he pre sented a piece of our Lord's sepulchre, which his brother, C\u0153ur-de-Lion, had brought from the Holy Land. Henry III. and Edward II. are among other crowned visitants. Several of the abbots of Battle were persons of historical importance. Odo, elected in 1175, was a man of such pure behaviour that after his death he was venerated as a saint. His life was written by a subsequent abbot. John of Thanet, 1297, wrote several legends, and was a skilful mathematician and musician. An example of the prowess ofthe \"Church-militant\" presents itself in fiamo de Offynton. In 1377 a French fleet arrived before Winchelsea, and the Admiral sent messengers to him, asking him to ransom that town. \" Nay,\" was the Abbot's reply, \" I cannot think of ransoming what I never lost.\" So the attack was made, and lasted from noon till eventide ; but at length the gallant abbot, with an extemporized army, beat them off, and sustained but little injury. The last abbot was John Hamond, who survived the dissolution of the convent, and dying at Battle, was buried, by his own desire, in the chapel of St. Catharine, in the parish church. In May, 1538, Sir John Gage and Dr. Layton, the royal commissioners, were sent down to dissolve the abbey, and to take account of its revenues, which, according to Speed, amounted to \u00a3987 per annum \u2014 a sum representing, at the pre sent value of money, almost \u00a310,000. How the monks contrived to spend so large an income it is difficult to say ; but the com missioners wrote to Cromwell, the Vicar-general, giving a de plorable account of neglect and mismanagement. The house hold implements, they say, are the worst ever seen in abbey or priory, and the vestments are described as \" old baysse, worn, raggede, and tome.\" The plate, however, was worth 400 marks. The establishment consisted of the abbot, 17 monks, and one novice, all of whom, except the last, received pensions. The abbey, notwithstanding the meagreness of its hbrary (19 volumes !), was exceedingly rich in muniments, royal and other charters, rolls, registers, &c, which came into the possession of the grantee of the abbey lands, and remained with his succes- sors until Sir Godfrey Webster, about 1 834, sold them to Mr. Thorpe, the bookseller, who, after printing a useful descriptive catalogue of them, resold them, bound in 97 folio volumes, to Sir Thomas Phillipps, of Middle Hill, where they still remain. They form a perfect treasury of local topographical literature. The statement of Browne Willis that Henry VIII. bestowed the site of the abbey on one Gilmer, is as unauthenticated as many of the other statements respecting this ancient founda-"], [81, "BATTLE OR BATTEL. 35 tion. The real grantee was Sir Anthony Browne, son-in-law of Sir John Gage, one of the King's \" visitors,\" whose descendants were the well-known Viscounts Montague, of Cowdray in West Sussex. Anthony, the 6th Viscount, sold the abbey to Sir Thomas Webster, Bart., a man of public spirit and anti quarian learning ; and from his descendants it has passed, in recent times, to His Grace Henry Vane, Duke of Cleveland, K.G., who has much improved and restored the remains of this great national monument, once deservedly called \"the token and pledge of the crown and realm of England.\" The town of Battle is pleasingly situated on high ground, surrounded with arable and pasture land, and hop-gardens. The chief manufacture carried on is that of gunpowder, the mills ranking amongst the largest in England. They have long been carried on by the Laurence family. By a singular fiction the patron of the benefice is called the Abbot, who appoints the incumbent, who is Dean of a privileged district called the Deanery of Battle. Wlien in the 12th century the parish church of St. Mary was erected for the parishioners, it was considered a chapel of the abbey, and the ministering monk was for greater dignity styled decanus. The church con sists of choir or chancel, nave with north and south aisles, pos sessing chancels, south porch, and an embattled west tower with stair turrets ; the aisles also have battlements and stair turrets. The building is chiefly Early English, with Decorated and other windows. In the choir are two plain sedilia and a piscina, and there are piscin\u00e6 in the north and south chancels. There are fragments of painted glass in the windows, and several monu ments of great interest, including brasses for a knight in plate armour ; another for Robert Acre, an ancient Dean of Battle ; a demi-figure in armour, for William Arnold, armiger, 1435 ; and a full-length figure of John Wythines, Dean of Battle, ob. 1615, set. 84, with a Latin epitaph, part of which may be trans lated \u2014 \" As lnng a time as I desired, I lived on earth below, Kor longer time nor less required, since Jesus willed it so.\" * Another slab formerly had two brass figures, one of which has been removed. They were for Thomas Alfraye, and Eliza beth his wife, daughter of Ambrose Comfort or Comport, 1599, with a curious metrical epitaph. Thomas, according to tradi tion, was a man of great physical strength, and this is confirmed by the epitaph. He \u2014 \" Soe in active strength did passe, As none was found his peere.\" \u2022 This personage is stated in a document, about 1558, to be \"very backward in religion,\" i.e., Protestantism. (See Horsefield.) D 2"], [82, "HISTORY OF SUSSEX 36 The most noticeable monument is the elaborate table-tomb of Sir Anthony Browne, K.G., standard-bearer and master of the horse to King Henry VIII., the first lay proprietor of Battle Abbey, and Alice his wife, daughter of Sir John Gage of Firle. It has recumbent effigies of the gallant knight and his lady, and was originally richly painted and gilt. Alice died in 1540 ; but, as there are blanks for the dates of Sir Anthony's death and age, it is clear that the monument was erected in his lifetime. For his character, see Lloyd's \" State Worthies,\" i, 183. There are tablets and other memorials for Dr. William Watson, dean, 1689 ; George Worge, Esq., of an ancient family in this parish; the Rev. Edmund Cartwright, D.D., F.R.S., prebendary of Lincoln, the inventor of the \" power loom,\"* and father of the historian of West Sussex ; Harriet, wife of Major Swaine, 1821, and many others. In the churchyard is a grave stone to the memory of Isaac Ingall, who died at the age of 120 years. Starr's Green, in this parish, a neat mansion of the last century, was built, and long inhabited, by the Worge family, who originated at Eastbourne. A large wood is called Bathurst, formerly Bodeherste. The statements that the noble famdy of Bathurst took their name from it, and erected a castle, which was destroyed during the Wars of the Roses, is unsupported by documents, though in the patent granted to the first Earl in 1772, raising him from the original dignity of Baron (1711) he is styled Earl Bathurst, of Bathurst, in co. Sussex. Among other gentle families connected with the parish in former times were the Gilberts, the Lunsfords, and the See Visita tion of 1634.

The ruins of this ancient monastery are among the most picturesque objects in the south of England. The domain lies in the two parishes of Lamberhurst and Frant, and the compa ratively recent mansion of the Marquis Camden forms an agree able contrast to the crumbling ruins of the \" auncient abbaye.\" The most conspicuous remains are a few arches of the refectory and portions of the dormitory. Some of the monastic cells, not very inviting to modern taste, stiU remain, as \"also a part of the abbey church, which measured 257 feet in length. There was originally a large transept with a central tower. The general style of. the architecture is that of the thirteenth century. The site is low and damp, as was the caSe\" with most of our monas teries, though this in nowise detracts from the beauty of the spot. The Rev. George Miles Cooper has given a very interest ing account of this establishment in Vol. ix. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" to which I am indebted for most of the substance of the following brief historical sketch. The abbey was originally founded at Otham, in Hailsham, but in consequence of the unhealthiness of that spot, was trans ferred to this place. The monastery owed its immediate erection to Sir Robert de Turneham, one of C\u0153ur-de-Lion's knights, of whom it was said \u2014 \" Robert of Turnham with his fauchioun, Gan to crack many a crown.\" But at length he met his death from the Saracens. * The reli gious order was that of Premonstratensians. Sir Robert was one of the most valiant men of his time, and a great benefactor to religious houses ; for besides contributing largely to Begeham, or Bayham, he was sole founder of Combwell Abbey, in Goud hurst. The small house of Premonstratensians, originally founded at Brockley, in Deptford, was combined with Otham in the foundation of Bayham, and De Turnham, in conjunction with Ela de Sackville, daughter of Ralph de Dene, the founder of Otham, fully established the brethren of both houses here. The Sackvilles, descendants of Ela, retained the advowson of * Sir Robert was immediately concerned in the rescue and ransom of his royal master from his Austrian captivity."], [84, "38 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Bayham till its suppression. At first the new foundation was known as Beaulieu, from its pleasant situation, and a curious corruption of that name exists in \" Bell's Tew,\" a neighbouring hamlet. The abbey was competently endowed, principally with lands in Kent and Sussex, and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. From time to time benefactions flowed in, and Bayham became a flourishing monastery. In the British Museum is the chartu lary of the Abbey, containing many interesting particulars of its progress and importance. To follow Mr. Cooper's details would be qrute beyond the scope of this work, and uninteresting to the general reader. We have but few notices of anything important connected with the abbey. In the decline of monas ticism discipline grew lax, and we find that at one of his episcopal visitations Bishop Redman (1488) made grave complaints of the neglect of religious service, and the ab sence of several of the canons, who were serving cures away from the house. He prohibited the use of \" unsightly and foppish boots and shoes\" which the brethren wore. He admonished the Lord Abbot to manage all temporal matters without doors, like a Martha, and all connected with night and day sendee within, like a Mary \u2014 ut Martha foris stu deat, eciam intus cum Maria. The discipline, however, con tinued to be bad, and the irregularities of the abbey caused scandal in the neighbourhood. The monastic bodies were gradually growing worse and worse, and hastening on their own destruction, till the great church-reformer, Henry VIII., swept them away. It was the monks themselves who prepared the hammer of that mighty \" malleus monachorum.\" Howbeit they had done good service in their earlier days, and Bayham is stated by Grafton to have been \" verie commodious to the countrey.\" Bayham received royal visits from Edward I., 1299, and Edward IL, 1324. Richard, the sainted Bishop of Chiehester, also came hither, and the bed on which he slept was supposed to retain certain healing qualities. Members of several distin guished families found sepulture here. The value of the house at the Dissolution was very small ; the number of canons was only five, and the revenues were granted, in 1526, to Cardinal Wolsey, for his colleges at Oxford and Ipswich. On this ambitious man's downfall, in 1530, the estates reverted to the Crown. Queen Elizabeth granted them, it is said, to two citizens of London, named Adams, though the Monasticon asserts that the grant was to Anthony Brown, Viscount Montague. In 1714 Ambrose Brown, a descendant of the Viscount's family, sold the site of the abbey to John Pratt, Esq., and in his ennobled and illustrious family it still remains."], [85, "39 BEACHY HEAD. This bold, romantic, and picturesque, though dangerous, promontory is one of the highest points of the South Downs, and forms the eastern termination of that beautiful range. Its pure chalky front, with its regular alternation of thin strata of flints, forms a truly grand spectacle. The Head lies about three miles to the west of Eastbourne, and rises to an elevation fof 575 feet. The view extends east to Hastings, and west, in clear weather, to the Isle of Wight. The coast of France is also occasionally visible. There are few headlands on our shores that have witnessed more frequent or more calamitous shipwrecks, though these have been greatly diminished since the erection, in 1831, of the lighthouse at Bell-Tout, which stands at some distance to the westward, on lower ground, though projecting farther into the sea. The etymology of thia promontory is uncertain. Why Beachy Head ? There is no more beach or shingle at its foot than is ordinary along the Sussex coast, nor indeed nearly so much as in many places, as, for instance, at Langney Point, to the eastward. I think, therefore, we must look to the French, \" beau chefs the fair head or promontory, and the adjacent spot, Beltout, evidently a French name, seems to support this supposition. These two spots, then, must have received their designations from our neighbours over the water ; when or how we shall perhaps never learn. Close under the Head is a cavern called \" Parson Darby's Hole,\" which is said to have been excavated for the preservation of shipwrecked sailors, by the Bev. Jonathan Darby, Vicar of East Dean, who died in 1726. Hither, on stormy nights, he used to betake himself and hang out a light, and thus he is said, on one occasion, to have saved twelve lives from a Dutch vessel. \" Wrecking\" and smuggling were formerly rife here, but this state of things is now changed for the better. For the ornithologist Beachy Head has singular attractions. Peregrine falcons, jackdaws, guillemots, and razor- bills, with many other sea-haunting fowls, make the fissures of this great cliff their favourite resort, and breed abundantly. The samphire grows very luxuriantly, and has more than once told the welcome story to the shipwrecked mariner that he was beyond high-water mark. Off this promontory, on June 30, 1690, took place a great naval combat between the combined English and Dutch fleets, of 56 sail, under Lord Torrington, and the French, of 82, under the Count de Tourville, which virtually resulted in the triumph of the British flag. Somewhat in advance of the almost perpendicular cliff formerly stood seven towering masses of chalk, known as the \" Seven Charleses,\""], [86, "40 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. but only one of these has resisted the undermining force of the ocean. There was in bygone days a local proverb: \" When the Charleses wear a cap, the clouds weep.\" The turf on the summit of Beachy Head is singularly verdant and velvet-like. Of this great promontory it may well be said \u2014 \" A strange eventful history Could this old Headland tell I\" BECKLEY. A parish in the Hundred of Goldspur; Rape of Hastings.

A pleasant village, on an elevated site. One spot commands a view of 14 parish churches. The river Rother divides the parish from Kent. The iron trade was formerly carried on here to a great extent ; cannon, shot, and chimney backs were the staple manufacture, and were exported from Rye. The works existed within the memory of our fathers. The derivation of the name from Bee, a stream, and lea, a pasture, is tolerably clear. Whether Beckley is the Beccaide of King Alfred's . will is a more difficult question. Knelle, in this parish, was the ancient seat of the family of Belknap, distin guished as politicians and lawyers, and as soldiers at Agin court and Stoke. From them it descended to the Shelleys of Michelgrove, and subsequently went by purchase to the family of Curteis. The church, which is dedicated to All Saints, consists of a nave, chancel, and tower, with a shingled spire, containing six bells. A chapel on the north side, dedicated to Our Lady, is appur tenant to the manor of Knelle, and was the burial place of the Belknaps. There are modern memorials for the families of Hooper, Lloyd, Fuller, Lewis, Hobbs, Waters, and Smith. Thomas Sharpe, Rector of Beckley, underwent severe treatment from the Parliamentary forces during the Civil Wars. [S. A. C. Iron works, ii, 207. Sharpe, Rev. Thomas, v, 72.

Agnew, Esq. ; St. Leonards, Robert Aldridge, Esq. ; St. Leonard's Lodge, W. E. Hubbard, Esq. Eastward of the parish of Horsham lies a tract of land called St. Leonard's Forest, containing between eight and nine thousand acres. It is part of the parish of Beeding in the southern part of the Rape, though locally, and for most civil and ecclesiastical purposes, entirely distinct from the mother parish. On the apportionment of the lands of Sussex, after the Conquest, several of the lords of honours and manors, whose principal seats were on or near the woodless South Downs, reserved to themselves a portion of land in the Weald or forest district for the necessary supply of timber and for sport. This was no doubt the case with the great family of De Braose, lords of Bramber, and hence this forest uninhabited, except by deer, wild boars, hares, grouse, and other objects of \" venerie,\" with a few verdurers to look after them, was considered a portion of their manor and parish of Beeding. Within the precincts of the forest were the two parks of Beaubush and Shelley, belong ing to the lords of Bramber, but disparked in the reign of Elizabeth. Early in the 18th century they belonged to John Middleton, Esq., and they were afterwards purchased by Lord Erskine, at whose decease they were sold to Thos. Broadwood, Esq., who built the castellated house called Holmbush. The southern portion of the forest was sold to C. G. Beauclerk, Esq. Thomas Lord Seymour, Lord High-Admiral of England, and brother of the Protector Somerset, who held considerable pro perty within the forest, contemplated the building of a town upon it. He fixed upon a site, and had his plans prepared ; but \" Seymour-Town \" was never built, probably in consequence of the sudden and bloody end put to his ambitious career by the Protector, against whom he was in conspiracy. St. Leonard's Forest was formerly a principal seat of the Sussex iron-works, and so continued until they were put an end to, partly for want of necessary fuel. In 44th Elizabeth the whole forest was leased by the Crown to Sir John Caryll. The"], [89, "43 BEEDING UPPER, OR SELE. works were afterwards employed for military stores for the use of Government, until 1643, when Sir William Waller, during his campaign in Sussex, destroyed them. Abundance of iron stone still remains, but the only traces of the manufacture now seen are the cinder beds, and the lagoons called hammer-ponds, which add greatly to the picturesque beauty of the forest. Be fore the Reformation there was a free chapel here, dedicated to the forest saint, St. Leonard. It is supposed to have stood about two miles from Horsham in the direction of Pease pottage gate. There was also a chapel appendant to Crawley, near Shelley Park, the site of which is called Chapel Fields ; in 1291 it was known as \" ecclesia de Shellye.\" Lower Beeding was, by Act of Parliament, 1838, constituted a distinct chapelry, and it supports its own poor. The church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, has been enlarged. There is also a chapel of ease dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The forest district is beautifully undulated, and watered with many small tributaries of the Adur. On its loftiest eminence is the \" beacon tower,\" built by Mr. Broadwood. It is 106 feet high, and 570 feet above high tide at London Bridge. The sweep of scenery which it commands is vast and delightful. As usual in forest districts, St. Leouard's possesses several weird legends. It has had its mounted headless Ghost, and its \" true and wonderful\" Dragon of 1614; but the most curious piece of folk-lore is that the nightingale does not sing here. Philomel had disturbed St. Leonard during his devotions, and so he con demned her to eternal sileuce within the holy precinct of the forest ; but for all these matters I must refer to what I have already put on record in vol. xiii.

The former lies partly in the valley of the Adur, and of course on low ground, while the latter is on the much higher level of St. Leonard's Forest. To whose ingenuity this inversion of terms is attributable I know not, but certainly the waters flow from the Lower Beeding to the Upper ! * Uppee Beeding includes the village, the site of the priory of Sele, and various farms of arable, pasture, wood, and down. It is named in King Alfred's will as Bedingum. King's Barns, locally in this parish close to Bramber Castle, is in the Hundred of Steyning ; it was a Grange attached to the residence of the Saxon Kings. Domesday mentions a mill and three salt-pans. A bank called Heathen Burials indicates the site of a ceme tery anterior to the introduction of Christianity. The descent of the manor of King's Barns is the same as that of Bramber Castle. The demesnes were slod by Thos. Earl of Arundel in 1639, and they have since been held by the families of Rychaut, Gale, and Clitherow. Beeding Court manor, after its alienation by Thos. Earl of Arundel in 1642, passed successively into the famibes of Edg cumbe of Mount Edgcumbe, and Bridger. Other manors in the parish are Totthigton, the Totintune of Domesday, now Lord Leconfield's, and Horton, which has belonged in succession to Maybank, Banister, Arnold, James, and Bridger. The church was given by William de Braose, in 1075, to the monastery of Saumur in Anjou, and the impropriation was held by the monks of Sele, who formed a branch of that establishment. It includes the great tithes and 70 acres of land, and is held under a beneficial lease from Magdalen College, Oxon. The vicarage house stands on the site of a religious house, and is called Beeding Priory. The church, dedicated to St. Peter, con sists of a nave, chancel, a low embattled tower, and a recently added south aisle. From its general appearance it would seem not to have formed any part of the conventual buildings. There are no monuments of interest. There are three bells, one of which is inscribed to St. Katerine, and another to St. Margarite. On Beeding hill, near the confines of Edburton and Old Shoreham, a very large tumulus was opened in 1800. It con tained upwards of 100 Roman urns of various sizes and degrees of fineness.

Bosworth."], [91, "45 BEEDING UPPER, OR SELE. this establishment is given in S. A. C. Vol. x., and from that paper the following notes are mainly condensed. In 1075 William de Braose, the Norman Lord of Bramber and proprietor of nearly the whole of that rape, gave to the Benedictine abbey of Florent, near Saumur in Anjou, several churches and lands in his newly acquired territory. Afterwards, desirous of having a religious establishment nearer home, he further endowed St. Florent with the churches of Sele or Beeding, Bramber, Old Shoreham, and De-Veteriponte ; hence the foundation of Beeding Priory. The establishment was never very large, consisting at most of four or five brethren. Of the size or character of the building little can be conjectured, as no vestiges of it now re main. Before 1790, when the present vicarage was built, the vicarial residence was part of the ancient priory, and the dining room the refectory of the monks. There were also fragments of old flint and stone walls, and ruined arches, in what is now the kitchen-garden. Sele shared the fate of the other alien priories during our wars with France ; but in the reign of Richard II. by letters patent, 1396, it became tributary to, instead of de pendent, as it had formerly been, upon Saumur. In 1459, Bishop Waynflete obtained its annexation to Magdalen College, which he had just founded. Previously there had been many ir regularities in the priory which called forth episcopal censure, and William Lewis, the prior, had been deposed for negli gence of duty, and personal vices. John Grigge, his successor, had forged a conventual seal and alienated lands surreptitiously. In 1480 only one monk remained, and in 1493 Sele priory was appropriated to the use of the Carmelite friars of Shoreham, whose house was ruinated and liable to be washed away by the sea. Here they remained until their final dissolution in 1544. Among the benefactors of Sele priory were Philip de Braose, the founder's son, and his son William, which latter confirmed to it the bridge of Bramber, three men (homines) and then- lands, five salt pans, the fisheries from Old Shoreham to Bedney, and a mill \u2014 a very singular medley. This benefactor is the only member of the founder's family recorded to have been buried in the priory. John de Braose, son of William, who was killed by a fall from his horse atBramber,in 1232,made large additions to the endowment, as did his son and successor William. Among many other bene factors were the De Bynes of West Grinstead, the Turners, De la Kneppes, Stanfords, and other Sussex families existing and extinct. For many other interesting particulars I must refer to Mr. Turner's careful and exhaustive paper. For an account of Lower Beeding, see preceding article. [S. A. C. King Edward I. visits, ii, 153.

This large and important parish on the English Channel has a picturesque village, seated on an agreeable eminence, and commanding extensive views both of sea and land. As yet, it is almost the only really available site on the Sussex coast that has not been turned into a \" watering place,\" for which its natural beauty and healthful climate eminently qualify it. Before the Conquest Bexelei was held by the Bishop of Selsey ; afterwards, Osbern held it of the Earl of Eu, but it was ulti mately restored to the Bishop (of Chiehester) in 1148. In 12th Elizabeth Lord Buckhurst had the manor, which has descended uninterruptedly to his representatives. Barnhorne and Buck holt are sub-infeudations. During the middle ages the Bishops of Chiehester frequently resided here, at their manor-house or palace. St. Richard de la Wyche probably rebuilt it, as it con tains arches, &c, of the Early English period ; but that he died here is a mis-statement. A part of the building is known as the prison, and not far from the house on the south is a terraced field, commanding a glorious view over Pevensey Bay, and called \"pleasure-house field\" \u2014 doubtless an ancient plaisaunce ofthe Bishops. In 26th Henry VI. Bishop Moleyns had license to embattle the manor-house, and to empark 2,000 acres in Bex hill with an enclosure of stone. The church is dedicated to St. Peter. It consists of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, with a low embattled tower at the west end. It has Norman and Early English features. In Horace Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting, is a representation of a two-light window \" taken out of Bexhill church,\" with figures said to be those of Henry III. and Queen Eleanor. Mr. Hayley was of opinion that they represented Edward III. and Queen Philippa. Lord Ashburnham procured the window for Mr. Wal pole !

During the French war there were extensive barracks at Bex hill, and the numerous body of troops caUed the German Legion were sometime quartered here. A \" submarine forest \" in this parish, at a place called Cooding, in Hooe level, excited considerable interest some years ago. The remains of about 200 trees, principally oak and birch, ex isted. Some of the trees stood four or five feet above the sur face; others had been worn away by the flux and reflux of the sea, but all were firmly embedded in the sand. They were ap parently of the \" recent \" period, like those at Selsey Bill, and not of any older, or more strictly geological epoch. In the early part of the present century an attempt was made to establish a colliery here. The appearance of thin seams of fibrous lignite, not uncommon in the Wealden formation, in duced some sanguine adventurers to sink shafts and erect machinery at an enormous cost. Adventurers of another kind encouraged the scheme, and fictitious specimens of coal were brought to the surface. But at length, after an outlay of \u00a380,000, the project was abandoned as completely abortive. Sidley Geeen is a hamlet in this parish. See also Noethete. [S. A. C.

The tything of Buddington is detached, and is contiguous to Ease bourne, some miles distant. After the Conquest, Robert held the manor as mesne tenant of Earl Roger, and sub-let it to Ralph. Besides a church, two mills, &c, mention is made of a quarry for mill-stones (molaria), the only instance in Domesday except one at \" Watone,\" Co. Notts. The Sanzavers were mesne ten ants from Henry III. to Edward III. It then reverted to the Earls of Arundel, who held it till 1542, when, by a forced ex change, Henry Vni. became seised of it. After various changes, it passed to the Kempes of Slindon, whose descendant, the late Dowager Countess of Newburgh, possessed it. Of the ten parks appendant to the Castle of Arundel, Bignor Park (an exempted manor) was one, and it was used for fatting deer brought in from the Forest, the venison of which was salted down and dried for the lord's winter supply. After several transfers it came to the family of Pellatt, who, in 1632, built a new house. William Pellatt, Esq., sold it in 1712 to Nicholas Turner, Esq. In 1806 it passed with the surrounding estate to John Hawkins, Esq., in whose family it still continues. In 1826 a large and elegant mansion, in the Grecian style, was erected. It is placed on an eminence, which commands a magnificent view of Sussex scenery, the South Downs from this point posses sing a romantic variety of outline, agreeably relieved by the valley of the Arun, and by park and woodland scenery. The house contains a fine collection of cabinet pictures, and some arch\u00e6ological remains. Bignor Park was one of the residences of Nicholas Turner, Esq., whose accomplished daughter, Charlotte Smith, passed much of her time, and wrote many of her sonnets here. (See \" Sussex Worthies,\" p. 15.) The church (St. Peter) is a small structure, with a chancel with lancet windows, a nave and north aisle (in which there was a chantry or royal free chapel), and a low slated tower at the west end. There are inscriptions for the families of Pellatt, German, &c. There are two very large yews. Bignor stands on the Roman road called Stane-street, leading fromRegnum (Chiehester) to London, and in 1811 the discovery of a Roman tessellated pavement here was followed by the ascer tainment of the site of a villa on a scale of grandeur rarely met with in this country. The discoveries were prosecuted over several years, and papers descriptive of them were printed in Arch\u00e6ologia, Vols. xviii. and xix., by Samuel Lysons, Esq., V.P. of the Society of Antiquaries, and reproduced in Dallaway's Rape of Arundel. It would far exceed my limits to give a detailed account of these remains, for which I must refer to the authorities named. It may be mentioned generally, however,"], [97, "BILLINGSHURST. 51 that the buildings have been traced to an extent of 650 feet, by 350, of which area the mansion proper, with its inner court, occupied nearly one half. The chief apartments were on the north-east side of this court, and opened into an ambulatory, or crypto-porticus, surrounding the court. At the south-west corner were baths and sudatories. There are three principal pavements. The largest, the one first disclosed, was perhaps that of the triclinium, or banqueting-hall, which is in two divisions. Its principal decorations are two circular compart ments, the smaller of which, 7^ft. in diameter, represents, in coloured tesser\u00e6 of careful workmanship, Ganymede and the Eagle ; the other contains dancing nymphs, &c. The second pavement, westward of this principal room, has a remarkable head, emblematical of Winter ; and the third exhibits a combat of Cupids, habited as gladiators. Fragments of Doric columns remain in one apartment, and another possesses a, focus, or open hearth. At Bignor Park is preserved a fine gold ring, set with an intaglio of exquisite workmanship, found here. There can be no doubt that this villa marks the site of Ad Decimum, the station at the tenth mile-stone from Regnum, in the great Stane-street, which is still traceable for many miles. And it is worthy of notice that, long before these discoveries were made, the inhabitants had a tradition that Bignor village originally stood on this spot, while an adjoining enclosure is called \" Town Field.\" The villa is conjectured to have been ofthe date of the Emperor Titus.

At a later period the Ta verners held it of Reginald, Lord la Warr. The priories of Tortington and Calceto had good lands here ; the church be longed to the former, and at the suppression the vicar was allowed to take the whole tithes, so that he is now virtually rector. The church, whose dedication is uncertain (St. Mary, St. Peter, and Holy Cross are mentioned) is a small structure of nave, chancel, and turret, with one bell. It has some Norman features. [S. A. C.

It was held before the Conquest by Alnod, a freeman. Afterwards Wuliam held it of Earl Roger, and it was held of him by Nigel. During subsequent centuries it was possessed by the Montalts, St. Johns, and Thomas, Lord la Warr. After several alienations it descended to the Peacheys (Lord Selsey). Part of Birdham was granted by King Cead walla to the church of Selsey, and at the suppression of the monasteries the portion which had belonged to the hospital of Arundel was annexed to Chiehester Cathedral. The church, which has early English features, consists of a nave, chancel, and square tower, with three bells, one of which is inscribed \" Johannes.\" The dedication, asserted by some to be to St. Leonard, is proved by wills of 1542 and 1545 to be to St. James. It was part of the endowment of Boxgrove Priory. [S. A. C. Domesday mill, v, 269. Church, xii, 69. xviii, 87. Boxgrove, xv, 89. Church Bells, xvi, 200. Turner of, xix, 95.] BIRLING, or BERLING.

This South Down village is interesting on several accounts. It belonged from remote antiquity to the Bishops of the South Saxons, and hence its name Biscopes-tun. In Domesday it is reckoned among the possessions of the Bishop of Chiehester, held in domain, and it was vested in his successors for some cen turies. Afterwards it came into the possession of the family of Pelham, and Thomas Pelham Holies, the great political Duke of Newcastle, had a seat here, the scene of bountiful hospitality. The house was taken down in 1831. At present the principal object in the parish is the extensive establishment, on a creek of the Ouse, known as the Tide-Mills, long and still the pro perty of the family of Catt. It was brought to nearly its present importance by the late Mr. William Catt, whose energy and talent for commercial enterprise rank him among the \" Worthies of Sussex.\" (See Memoirs in Worthies of Sussex, p. 217.) It is a coincidence that as Bishopston possesses the largest watermill ever constructed in the county, so it had perhaps the oldest windmill on record in Sussex, which was given by Bishop Seffrid'to the see of Chiehester in 1199. At Norton in this parish (the correlative of Sutton, in Sea ford) resided James Hurdis, D.D., Vicar of the parish, and Pro fessor of Poetry at Oxford, born 1763, died 1801. His \"ViUage Curate,\" and other poems in the style of Cowper, gave him con siderable popularity, and his amiable character endeared him to a large circle of admirers. See memoir in \" Worthies of Sussex,\" pp. 161 \u2014 171. Norton is a hamlet, and formerly had a chapel, dependent on Bishopston. The church, though small, is exceedingly interesting. It is situated in a vale, surrounded by lofty elms, and has traces of very early architecture. It originally consisted of a west tower, of simple but elegant proportions, crowned by a low pyramidal roof, nave, chancel, north aisle, and south porch. What is now the chancel seems to be an addition of the Transition period. It has been described as the \" Holy of Holies ;\" it is probably a Lady-Chapel, though such an adjunct is very rare in churches so small as this. There are features of Norman and early English work, and some undoubted remains of Saxon or Pre- Norman, particularly the porch, which exhibits \" long and short\" masonry, together with a sun-dial, set up by some un known Saxon, and inscribed with his name, +EADRIC. The interior contains a very singular medieval monumental slab, with sacred symbols ; also memorials of the Hurdis and other families. In the church-yard are many altar-tombs of the Coopers, Catts, Farncombes, &c. Adjacent to the church-yard is an almshouse for poor aged persons, built and endowed by George Catt, Esq., as a memorial for Mary- Ann, his first wife, who died in 1856."], [102, "56 HISTORY OF SUSSEX.

Date of earliest Parish Register, 1563. Acreage, 821. Seat, Blatchington Court, leased to W.Tyler Smith, Esq., M.D. The whole parish, with the exception of 17 acres belonging to Government, is the property of the representatives of the late John King, Esq. The manor was held in early times by a family of its own name. Robert de Blechington gave to the Priory of Michelham his lands hi Kell. In Norman times it had belonged to the Peverells. In the 15th century it belonged to the Wests, Lords la Warr, and afterwards to the Jefferays, who subsequently removed to Chiddingly. The viUage is pleasantly situated on the South Downs, and commands a delightful sea view, with the town of Seaford in the foreground. The church, dedicated to St. Peter, has lately been restored. It consists of a nave, chancel, and west tower, sup porting a shingled spire. The chancel has some Norman features, but two sedilia and a piscina are of later date. In the south waU of the nave is a deep, richly-ornamented recess, the object of which is not clear. There has formerly been a south aisle. There are memorials for the families of Gilbert (possessors of the manor, 17th century), King, Lewis, and Chambers. The church-yard is a delightful spot, and during summer, when the graves are covered with choice flowers, it resembles a garden \u2014 thanks to the liberality of the rector and his wife. Blatchington adjoins the sea on the south ; and on a com manding spot extensive barracks were erected during the French * This decrease in the SO years is owiDg to the removal, after the French war, of the troops from Blatchington barracks."], [103, "57 BLATCHINGTON WEST. war, as well as a fort of considerable strength.

A parish in the Hundred of Whalesbone ; Rape of Lewes ; distant two miles north-west from Brighton, its post-town. Union, Steyning. Population in 1811, 49 ; in 1861, 59. The Benefice, a Rectory, has long been ecclesiastically united with the Vicarage of Brighthelmston. Acreage, 876. This parish consists of one large manor-farm, the property of the Earl of Abergavenny. It was long the estate of the Lords la Warr, and from them was transferred in 1435, to the NevUles who have ever since held it. The family of Scrase who had for many generations the farm of the manor, and some branches of which stiU exist, were of great antiquity in this dis trict, and said to be of Danish descent. The present representa tive is Charles Scrase-Dickins, Esq., of Coolhurst, Horsham. After the Reformation, the Scrases adhered to the old system, but in the 17th century they became conspicuous as Quakers. The church of St. Peter, which has long been in ruins, stands within the ambit of the manor-house ; it originally consisted of a nave and chancel of equal width, but had no tower. The west end had two smaU Norman windows. The house has been much modernized, and reduced in dimensions ; there are, however, in dications of antiquity in a trefod-headed window, and a buttress perhaps of the 15th century. In 1818, several remains of a Roman villa were found here; some pottery, and painted stucco, a quern, and two or three coins of Tetricus were exhumed. That these remains had any connection with the \" Portus Adurni,\" as conjectured by Mr. Douglas, is an error. [S. A. C. Scrase family of, Pedigrees, &c. (Lower), viii, 1. xvi, 49, 68, 89. xvii, 248.

Benefice, a Vicarage valued at \u00a3280 ; Patron, George Cubitt, Esq., M.P. ; Incumbent, Rev. Charles Parker, M.A., of Caius College, Cambridge. The vicarage house is large and handsome, and of modern erection. Date of earliest Parish Register, 1557. Acreage, 1,596. A rather exhaustive account of Bodiam has been published by the author of these volumes in the \" Sussex Collections,\" and also as a separate monograph. The following particulars are condensed from the materials there brought together. At the Domesday survey, Osborn, Roger, and Ralph held it as tenants of the Earl of Eu. Osborn and his descendants were known as De Bodiam, and were the principal feudatories here. One of them was in Cceur-de-Lion's crusade, and another in the war against France, 1215. They continued as mesne tenants tiU the 13th century, and were influential in the district. William de Bodiam, the last male heir, was a benefactor to Battel Abbey, and also, as it would seem, to that of Robertsbridge, where a fragment of his tomb was remaining in 1831. His heiress, Margaret, is presumed to have carried the lordship to the family of Wardedieu or Wardeux. Henry de Wardeux was a bene factor to Battel, sheriff of Sussex, and in military service against the Scotch, 1301. One of this name in 1382 gave by will a certain sum towards the building of the church at Bodiam. Elizabeth, the heiress of Wardeux, married Sir Edward Dalyngruge, representative of an ancient family who originated at a place so called near East Grinstead. He was a distinguished military commander in the campaigns of Edward III., against France, and shared in the glories of Cressy and Poictiers. In the turbulent reign of Richard II. he joined Sir Robert Knowles and Sir John Hawkwood, in their marauding expeditions in France, and realizing a large portion of the spoils of war, built the Castle of Bodiam, as it now stands, on the banks of the Rother. The older mansion of the De Bodiams and Wardeuxs was in another part of the parish, and the moat of it stdl re mains. The King's license for the erection of the castle, dated 20th October, 1 386, is still extant. A memoir of Sir Edward, with an account of his mutilated effigy found at Robertsbridge Abbey, is given in Vol. xii. of the S. A. C. His niece and ulti mate heiress married Sir Thomas Lewknor, and so carried Bodiam Castle and lordship to that ubiquitous and influential family, with whom it remained for some generations, though not without occasional interruptions. During the Wars of the Roses individuals of the family took opposite sides, and Sir Thomas Lewknor, the owner of Bodiam, was attainted of treason for his"], [105, "59 BODIAM. adherence to the Lancastrian party, and compelled to sur render his castle to Richard III., in 1484. After the overthrow of Richard at Bosworth-field the attainder was reversed, and the Lewknors continued owners of Bodiam, though not frequently resident there. A moiety of it remained in the family until the Civil Wars, when this and other castles and mansions of the Royalist gentry were dismantled by the troops of Sir WiUiam Waller, and in the present case nothing but the bare enceinte or outward walls and towers was left. The other moiety came into the possession of the Levett family, and after the restoration of Charles II. , the whole property of Bodiam was vested in the Tufton family, who transferred it to the PoweUs, Barts. From the PoweUs it was purchased by Sir Thomas Webster, of Battle Abbey, Bart. His descendant, Sir Godfrey V. Webster, sold it in 1828 to the late John Frdler, Esq., of RosehiU, and it has since passed with the latter estate, untU its recent purchase by George Cubitt, Esq., M.P., who carefuUy preserves the venerable castle. Bodiam Castle occupies a low spot in the valley of the Rother and is surrounded by a large moat, or rather artificial lake, com municating with that river, and producing in the ensemble many charming studies for the artist. The budding itself is a paral lelogram approaching a square, with a circular tower at each angle, and intervening quadrangular towers. On the north side is the great gateway, flanked by two fine square towers, and opposite, in the south waU, is a postern or back gate. The towers, nine in number, with the curtain walls, remain almost entire. The great gateway is approached by a causeway, and 20 yards in advance of it, i. e., about one third ofthe width ofthe moat, stood the barbican, of which Uttle now remains. Over the gateway are the arms of De Bodiam, Dalyngruge, and Wardeux, with the crest of Dalyngruge. The interior has been almost en tirely \" gutted,\" yet the sites of the guard-room, the servants' offices, the chapel, with a priest's chamber, the ladies' bower, the armoury, the great hall, the buttery, the kitchen, and other apartments are traditionally pointed out. AU the towers are divided into stories lighted by loop-holes, and reached by newel staircases. The inner area or quadrangle measures about 90 ft., by 77. To the north of the castle is a field caUed the Castle field or gun-garden, and there is a tradition that the fortress was once assaulted from that point. Altogether there are few baronial fortresses of late date in the south of England which possess so much interest as that of Bodiam. The church, dedicated to St. Giles, occupies a commanding site. It consists of a low embattled tower, a nave, with north and south aisles under one roof, and a chancel. Little of its architectural character remains. Early English features are"], [106, "60 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. retained, but there have been many subsequent additions and rebuUdings. There are several fragments of brasses, including one of a JBt ISotnam, another of \u0152ljomaS <2tt0bc, and a third of 2L2Mltatn fflSartfjfrtcn, 1513. Some painted glass, including the arms of Dalyngruge, Beauchamp, and Boteler, has disappeared. There are memorials in the church and church-yard to the fami lies of Croker, Munn, Hiland, Bird, Siveyer, Davis, Tress, &c. There is, or has been, a remarkable echo on the north side of Bodiam Castle, capable of repeating more than a full hexameter. I once tried to coquet with the talkative nymph, but either the anger of Juno, or some other impediment, prevented a satisfac tory response. [S. A. C. Bodiam and its Lords (Lower), ix, 275, 302.

A hamlet of South Bersted, and a market-town ; distant seven miles from Chiehester. It is a post-town, and has a branch railway from Barnham, on the South Coast line, distant about four miles. Population, with Bersted, 1,195. Benefice, a Perpetual Curacy valued at \u00a3110 ; Patron, the Archbishop of Canterbury ; Incumbent, Rev. Edward Miller, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge. This quiet watering-place was only an obscure village in the parish of South Bersted, inhabited by fishermen and labourers, until the year 1785, when Sir Richard Hotham, noticing its salubrity and capabdities for sea-bathing, brought it into notice. He devoted the latter days of his life, and the sum of \u00a360,000 to Bognor, with a view of making it a fashion able watering-place ; but did not succeed in fixing the intended name of Hothampton upon it. He died in 1799, poorer in purse, and with an unfulfiUed object. Others, however, entered into his labours, and Bognor has succeeded in attracting from time to time many fashionable and wealthy residents and visitors, among whom may be named her present Majesty, when Princess Victoria, and her mother, the late Duchess of Kent, who resided during several summers at Bognor Lodge. The town, although"], [107, "61 BOGNOR. situated on almost a dead level, is possessed of considerable natural beauty in its surroundings. It is governed under the provisions of a Local Act. The episcopal chapel of St. John was erected by subscription in 1821. There is the usual accommodation in the shape of lodging-houses and hotels. Before Sir R. Hotham's improvements, the only hostelry in the place was a thatched public-house called the \" Fox.\" Bognor Rocks are well known, and carefuUy avoided by watchful mariners. They are of the dark grey limestone and sandstone formations, extend about two miles into the sea, and are visible at low water. When pulverized and duly compounded they form what is called \"Roman cement.\" The \"Ower's Light \" is a ship stationed about nine miles from the shore for the prevention of shipwrecks. An educational institution for girls has been established at Bognor, upon the same principles as those at Lancing and Hurst- Pierpoint for boys. It is dignified with the title of St. Michael's College, and the principal assumes the title of \" Lady Warden.\" [S. A. C. Roman coins, i, 29.

Huth, Esq., has a splendid mansion in course of construction. Horsfield gives a Domesday account of this parish. I can not find any entry there. The manor gave name as early as temp. Edward I. to the family of De Bolney, who held it for at least eleven generations, until temp. Elizabeth, when it passed to Sir Benjamin PeUatt. From the PeUatts it was transferred to the Dennetts, who rebuilt the manor-house in 1692. It was afterwards possessed by the Lintotts and Leppards. Of the manor of Combe, in this parish, the old and forgotten family of Costidel were proprietors in the 15th century. Garston belonged to the Langfords. Bolney lies in a pleasant sylvan district, and St. Leonard's"], [108, "62 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Forest extends into it. Bolney Common is an agreeable spot, and has, or had, a local reputation for cherries and camomiles. The sands and clays of this parish are ferruginous, and iron works were formerly carried on. The furnace ponds and a road called Coalwood-street, are now the only traces of the manufac ture of iron and of charcoal. Fish of the salmon tribe frequent the streams, and Horsfield mentions the capture of a trout weighing 221bs., which the parish clerk sent as a present to George TV. The church of St. Mary Magdalen consists of a nave, chancel, north aisle (added not long since), and a square tower with pinnacles at the west end. This tower was built in 1536-8, principaUy at the cost of John Bolney, Esq., whose arms, with those of St. Leger, appear on it. It contains a very musical peal of eight bells. The church, though for the most part much more modern, has traces of pre-Norman architecture, particularly in the narrow and lofty doorway, long concealed by a modern porch. Among the mortuary inscriptions occur the names of Bolney, Dennett, &c. Gravely is a family name of long standing here. [S. A. C. Iron works, ii, 207.

Johnson, Esq., Thomas Heaver, Esq., and John Baring, Esq. This flat alluvial parish is bounded on two sides by branches of the estuary known as Bosham Creek, or Chiehester Harbour, and is intersected in many parts with sewers and ditches. In the parish are extensive brick and pottery works, the property of Mr A. Cheesman. Besides the excellent papers which have appeared in \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological CoUections,\" by the Rev. H. Mitchell, tbe Rev. Edward Turner, and the Rev. F. H. Arnold, referred to below, there is an excellent monograph caUed \" Bosham,\" by C. J. Long croft, Esq., written in an elegant and pleasing style, 1867. From this pamphlet the following details are partly abridged. So far back as the Roman possession, about a.d. 43 ,the neigh bourhood was inhabited, from its proximity to Regnum (Chiehes ter). Vespasian's camp lay on the left bank of the harbour of Chiehester, and a place caUed Old Park has been fairly identi fied with the earthworks once occupied by the Roman Legions. The tradition of Vespasian's having had a palace here is but weakly supported, though remains of a Roman building of some importance were discovered in 1832. It contained an apart ment, or more properly an impluvium, or open court, 45 feet square, with a circular bath and rooms adjoining. About 150 yards distant was a large excavation, with seats like those of an amphitheatre. Coins of Antoninus were found near the spot, to the north-west of Broadbridge House. At some time during the occupation of Western Sussex, and as is supposed in the fourth century, under the reign of Constantine, a basilica was built on part ofthe site ofthe present church of Bosham. In no other way can we account for the existence of large quantities of Roman brick, tile, and mortar recently found in the interior, and forming part of the present walls. The bases of the columns of the chancel arch are doubtless Roman. After Christianity had nearly died out in Sussex, towards the end of the seventh century, St. Wilfred, Bishop of York, expelled from his northern see, settled at Selsey, as the Apostol and Bishop of the South"], [110, "64 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Saxons, and preached the Gospel with energy and success to a very benighted population. But previously, under the auspices of Adelwalch, King of Sussex, one Dicul, a Scottish, or rather Irish monk (Scotus), had settled at Bosham about 650. Bede says of him that he, with five or six brethren, \" lived poorly and served God.\" Would that every poor man could do the same ! But, as Mr. Longcroft observes, they were more like hermits than missionaries. The map annexed to the MS. Saxon Chronicle shews Bosham as one of five places only of sufficient importance to be denoted in the county of Sussex. At a later date Canute, the Danish King, had a palace at Bosham, and one of his daughters was, according to current tradition, buried in the church. It is not unreasonable to suppose that he built that edifice, so as to comprise the ancient Roman basilica. In, or shortly after the death of Canute (1035), the church and manor were annexed to the see of Canterbury, then in the hands of Archbishop Agilnotus. The ambitious Earl Godwin, like many other wealthy persons, was not satisfied with his acquisitions, and he set his heart upon Bosham. He obtained it by a trick ; for one day meeting the Archbishop, he requested from him the kiss of peace, then called basia. Artfully, by the change of a vowel, he addressed the Primate with, \" Da mihi Boseam.\" The Archbishop cheerfully complied with his request, and kissed him. Godwin was impudent enough to thank him ; called his retainers to witness that the Archbishop had given him Bosham ; returned to that manor, and held it vi et armis. The hall of this old Saxon estate is conjectured to have stood on the northern side of the church-yard, and part of the moat yet remains. Bosham, with Godwin's other possessions in West Sussex and East Hampshire, devolved on his son Harold, who was occasion ally resident here. In the Bayeux tapestry, with the legend, \" Harold, dux Anglor. et sui milites equitamnt ad Bosham,\" he is represented on horseback, with a hawk on his wrist, and accom panied by greyhounds, on the point of embarking for the coast of Normandy. He is followed by knights, and a church is de picted, with the word ecclesia, into which he appears entering, accompanied by another, as if to implore divine protection for his voyage. On the faU of Harold at Hastings, the Conqueror of course seized his great estates, and at the date of Domesday, Bosham was held in demesne of the King. It consisted of 66^ hides of land, and contained 39 viUeins, and 50 bordarers,with 19 ploughs. There were a church, 17 ministri, eight mills, two fisheries, and a wood. It is stated to have been of the value of \u00a340 in the time of the Confessor. This was the secular part of Bosham. The ecclesiastical part was held by Osbern, Bishop of"], [111, "BOSHAM. 65 Exeter. It consisted of a church or monastery with 112 hides of land, three mills, and a salt-pan. The total value of the manor is said to have reached, in the time of the Confessor, the enormous amount of \u00a3300 ; but it should be understood that Bosham was more of the nature of a barony than a simple manor, as it comprised the sub-infeudations of Chidham, Thorney, Funtington, West Stoke, and part of Appledram and Itchenor. These particulars tend to show the ancient importance of Bosham, which must have been one of the principal places in Sussex. It appears from a feodary book preserved at Arundel Castle, that soon after the Conquest Roger de Montgomeri, Earl of Arundel and Chiehester, had the privflege of six annual fairs here. Before the death of the Conqueror, the manor became the fee of William Fitz-Aucher. At this period the humble monastery of Dicul had expanded into an ecclesiastical estabbshment second to few in England. Herbert de Bosham, a native of this place, was private secretary to Archbishop Becket, whose life he afterwards wrote, under the title of \"Vita Sancti Thom\u00e6 ;\" and so popular did his work prove, that there was scarcely a convent in England which did not possess a copy of it, and the original Latin text was translated into French and Engbsh, both in prose and rhyme. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 82.) In 1189, John Mareschal, the violent opponent of Becket, obtained a grant of Bosham from Henry II. At his death William Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke, had a like grant, paying yearly \u00a342 to the Exchequer. In 36 Henry III., the manor was possessed by Hugh Bigod, and from him it passed early in the next reign to Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. Edward IL, in the sixth year of his rule, granted the manor and hundred of Bosham, with other large possessions, to his half-brother, Thomas de Brotherton, whose daughter and heiress married Lord Segrave. Through that famdy the lordship came to the Mowbrays, subsequently Dukes of Norfolk. During these suc cessive holdings, Bosham possessed many privileges and immuni ties, and it still enjoys them, having its Coroner, Chamberlain, and other officials. The noble family of Norfolk held the lord ship until 1475, when a partition of their vast estates was made. Isabel, wife of James, Lord Berkeley, one ofthe heiresses of John, Duke of Norfolk, had, as a portion of her share, the hundred and manor of Bosham. In the hands of the Berkeley famdy, through many changes, a considerable portion of Bosham has remained for the last four centuries. Mr. Thorncroft gives a graphic account of the pestUence which broke out at Chiehester in the memorable plague-year 1665, and relates how the people of Bosham, influenced by humane F"], [112, "66 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. and charitable principles, carried food to the diseased and famine-stricken people of the old city. It does not appear that Bosham itself was visited by that dire calamity. Henry I. gave good lands in this manor to WUIiam Warle waste, Bishop of Exeter, who founded a College composed of a dean and five secular canons on the old ecclesiastical basis. The subsequent Bishops of Exeter claimed jurisdiction over the establishment, and this led to great disputes between them and the Diocesans of Chiehester. In the time of Bishop Langton, of the latter see, Walter Stapylton, Bishop of Exeter, in the performance of his visitatorial function, was inhibited by the Sussex Bishop, who, in his own cathedral, excommunicated Stapylton with bell, book, and candle. This, however, was an error, as Bosham had been immemoriaUy accounted a royal free chapel, over which the Bishops of Chiehester had no control. The prebends of the church were those of Walton, Chidham, Westbroke, Funtington, and Appledram. The stalls of the prebendaries, with their misereres, still remain in the chancel of the church. They are probably of the date of Henry VII. The site of the College was on the south side of the church-yard, and considerable remains of it existed not many years since. Part of the building was long used as a vicarage-house, and in the garden was a colossal head, variously conjectured to have been intended for the semblance of that of Trojan, Woden, and St. Christopher ! It is now in the palace garden at Chiehester. The church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, is replete with interest, both architectural and historical. The Saxon church is presumed to have consisted of the present tower, the present nave, and a chancel terminated by an apse. The tower, now crowned with a spire, exhibits \" long and short work,\" roughly dressed. Bishop Warlewaste considerably modified the build ing by lengthening the choir or chancel, and adding north and south aisles, as also by inserting Early English windows in the chancel. The east end has a group of five lancets. At the end of the north aisle was the chantry of Fishbourne, founded before the year 1280, and endowed with 23 acres of land in Appledram. In the north wall of the chancel is an \" Easter sepulchre,\" or recess, containing a mutilated stone effigy of what was tradi tionally a daughter of King Canute ; but the costume belongs to about the time of Edward I. The real place of the deposit of that scion of royalty was, however, discovered in 1865, by the Rev. Henry Mitchell, the Vicar, beneath the flooring on the right side of the chancel arch. The rude stone coffin with its lid was five feet long, and the bones appeared upon anatomical examination to be those of a child about eight years of age. These interesting remains are faithfuUy figured in \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" Vol. xviii., p. 5. There is a small"], [113, "BOSHAM. 67 crypt under the south aisle, the top of which rises considerably above the floor. Its object and use are not very apparent. The bells of the tower are seven in number, the oldest dating from 1572. Here must be mentioned the legend of the \" Bosham Bell.\" In the days of the Northmen, a party of pirates came up the Creek in search of pillage. They plundered the inhabi tants, sacked the church, and carried off the tenor bell of the monastery. Having put their spoil on board, they dropped down the channel with the ebbing tide ; but by the intervention of St. Nicholas the bell refused to remain in such wicked hands, and sank through the deck and the hold of the vessel to the bottom of a great hole in Bosham channel, known to this day as the \" Bell hole,\" to the great consternation of the heathen marauders. It is still the belief of the good folk of Bosham that though the beU is deep down in the water, it has not lost its power of resonance, and that whenever a sturdy peal is rung out from the church tower, the lost tenor chimes in with her sister bells, and those standing at the brink of the \" BeU hole \" can distinctly hear the whole octave peal. This phenomenon is ex plained by Mr. Thorncroft on the principles of acoustics, and is an actual reality to the ear. Another tradition is worthy of record. Within the memory of man an enormous pole was suspended horizontaUy on the inside of the nave of the church. It was believed to have been the staff of a giant \u2014 some say Sir Bevis of Southampton ; others think it may have been that of St. Christopher, the patron saint of fords, several of which existed in the parish in ancient times. I cannot help thinking it was somehow connected with the colossal head previously mentioned, though it may have been a votive offering from some mariner rescued from a/ foundering vessel. The sea has made great incursions in this parish, and much valuable land has been submerged. Smuggling was formerly carried on by the inhabi tants, and the church is said to have been occasionaUy used as a place of deposit for the contraband articles ! [S. A. C.

At the time of the Domesday survey it was held by William de Braose, Lord of Bramber, who held Haningedune in person. Norman held it of King Edward. It was then assessed at twelve hides, and was afterwards rated at six. There were five ploughlands, fifteen vUlagers, and thirty-four bondsmen ; also a church and a wood, producing pannage for ten hogs. Before the Conquest this manor was valued at \u00a312, but it afterwards rose to \u00a325. The manor here referred to was that of Annington, the prin cipal estate in the parish. Of the later history of this manor I can learn nothing until 1427, when it belonged to the family of Merlot. Temp. Elizabeth it belonged to Laurence Levitt, who held it ofthe manor of \"Broadwater. From him it descended to the family of Eversfield, in whose descendants it vested until it was alienated to the Goring family. By a tradition, Annington was the ancient Vipont which gave name to the church and family De Veteri-ponte ; but this is doubtful. The great tithes belonged to the abbey of Saumur in France, and followed the fate of the neighbouring alien priory of Sele. The advowson was transferred to Magdalen College. The church (St. Botolph) is very ancient, and, as Mr. Bloxam informs me, contains undoubted traces of Saxon architecture. There are memorials to the families of Scrase, Turner, Cowdray, Manning, WiUet, Heaver, and Penfold. Others formerly ex isted for the names of Eversfield and Willan.

This parish, partly agricultural and partly down, is full of interest, possessing remains of a religious house, and of the ancient mansion of Halnaker, as well as being the abode of the great Ducal house of Richmond, and containing the re nowned Goodwood racecourse. The manor is named in Domes day as being in the hundred of Bosgrave. In the reign of the Confessor two freemen held it of the King. It was assessed at six hides. In the reign of Henry I. the manor of Halnaker was annexed, and was given to Robert de Haia. William Lord St. John possessed it in 1254, and the united lordships continued in his family for several generations. The famUy of Poynings as ' erwards became seised, and subsequently that of West. In 1540, Thomas West, Lord la Warr, made a compulsory exchange of these and other manors with Henry VEIL, accepting in Ueu thereof the dissolved priory of Wherwell, in Hampshire. Queen Elizabeth granted Boxgrove to Sir John Morley. Sir WilUam Morley, who died in 1701, was succeeded by his daughter, Mary, Countess of Derby, and at her death in 1752 the estate devolved on her cousin, Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bart., who sold it in 1765 to Charles Lennox, Duke of Richmond, whose noble descendant is stdl in possession. Another Domesday manor called Strettone, now Strettington, has been absorbed in the general estate. East Hampnett is a tything in the parish. It was purchased temp. Elizabeth, by the family of Peckham. From them it passed by sale to the notorious Judge Jeffreys. The Tumours, afterwards ennobled as Lords Winterton, were the next proprietors. Within the demesnes of Goodwood stood the great mansion called Halnaker House. No doubt the original manor-house was built by Robert de Haia, married to a lady of royal blood, temp. Henry I., who gave him the estate. The later mansion is said to have been buUt by Sir Thomas West, who married, early in the reign of Henry VIII., Elizabeth, heiress of John Bonville, whose family had held the estate from 1458, as successors to part of the possessions of the Poynings family. It was a large and partly embattled structure, situated in a smaU park. There was a gateway flanked with octagonal towers and defended by a portcullis, leading into a quadrangle. The great haU with its timber framing and oak paneUing was a grand apartment. At length the building feU to decay, partly through neglect and partly by the ravages of the insidious ivy, and at the present time we behold only a fragment of what was of yore one of our greatest Sussex houses. There was formerly a free chapel"], [116, "70 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. here, but its site is not distinguishable. The etymology of Hal naker has not been ascertained ; it was long written Halfenafced, which we cannot accept au pied de la lettre. The Priory of Boxgrove was one of the principal monastic es tablishments of West Sussex. The existing remains prove that the buildings were very extensive. The Rev. Edward Turner has written the history of this monastery very fully in the 15th Vol. ofthe \" Sussex Collections.\" Few spots in Sussex deserve more attentive examination than this. The priory was built between 1117 and 1135, the founder being Robert de Haia, a relative, as before stated, of Henry I., \" consanguineus ejus dem Regis.\" It was of the order of St. Benedict, and dedicated to St. Mary and St. Blaise; and it was made dependent on the abbey of Lessai near Coutances in Normandy, of which De Haia was also the founder. After the wars with France by Henry V., this house was \" retained and indigenized \" by a royal charter. Whether box trees ever abounded on the spot I know not, but the motto on the oldest seal of the priory runs thus : \u2014 \" Dicitur ex ligno viridi Boxgravia digno.\" Mr. Turner thinks the latter syllable is derived from graven, a grave or earthwork, in aUusiom to a British fosse, considerable remains of which still exist in the parish. The number of monks at the date of the foundation was but three, but it was eventu ally raised to sixteen, one of whom served the free chapel of Halnaker; and the house was weU endowed with manors, churches and lands, in this and other counties. Besides the successive lords of Boxgrove it had benefactors in several wealthy and noble families of West Sussex. The priory was dissolved in 1535, when the site was granted to Thomas, Lord la Warr, for the sum of \u00a3126 13s. 4d. His lordship had pleaded earnestly with the vicar-general CromweU for the preservation of the establishment, which he caUed \" a powr howse \" near his \" powr howse callyd Halnaker,\" where many of his ancestors lay buried, and where he had himself built a sepulchral chapel ; but the appeal was vain. The conventual church, however, was retained, as the parish church, and was under the same roof. How much of the conven tual buddings was saved from destruction is not known. A consi derable part remained untU about 1780, when it was pulled down for the sale of the materials, and even now some fragments exist. The grand Early English church,* with traces of the parochial church, remain to gladden the eyes of the architect aud anti quary ; and it is stated on very good authority to be \" one of the most important specimens of its style in the kingdom.\" As it * In 1704, Lady Mary Morley, afterwards Countess of Derby, endowed the vicar age with the great tythes, and founded 12 almshouses in the village."], [117, "71 BOXGROVE. stands it consists of choir, aisles, transepts, and a central tower, the last being of Norman character. The choir is divided into four square compartments, \" each having a cross vault with ribs, the diagonal being enriched with the tooth ornament.\" The architecture is eminently beautiful, especially in the clerestory. Under the second bay on the south side of the choir is the sacel lum of Thomas, Lord la Warr, a splendid and elaborate speci men of the style of his period, and can scarcely be deemed \"a powr chapell.\" It is now the pew of the noble family at Good wood. There are many ancient monuments in this fine church. Philippa, Countess of Arundel, hes in the choir. In the wall ofthe north aisle are three uninscribed arched tombs. Two daughters of AdeUza of Louvaine, .Queen of Henry I., are known to have been buried here, and two of these memorials were probably in tended for them ; but \u2014 \" Monuments themselves memorials need.\" In the north transept is a monument for Sir WiUiam Morley, and opposite, another for the Countess of Derby, his heiress. In the south aisle are three more arched tombs. There are many encaustic tiles on the floor, and on the ceiling of the choir are some remains of painting, reminding one of Bishop Sherburne's in Chiehester cathedral, and probably executed by one of the Bernardis. Many fragments of this priory are visible in the farm waUs and buddings. Whatever modern notions ofthe dissolution of the monasteries may be, we can hardly suppress a feeling of some regret that Boxgrove was included in the general downfall ; for Com missioner Layton reports of the last prior that he is \" a great husbonde, and kepith gret hospitalitie,\" and adds that \" ejus monachi omnes sunt ejusdem farin\u00e6.\" Goodwood park, named most likely from its Saxon proprietor Godwinus, was purchased from the Compton family by the Duke of Richmond, about 1720. The domain is most agreeable, the views from the higher ground being very grand ; but the house possesses no great interest. It was constructed by Sir WiUiam Chambers, and added to by Wyatt. The coUection of pictures and sculpture is extensive and interesting, and contains paint ings, busts, &c, of royal and noble persons by Vandyke, Sir P. Lely, Kneller, NoUekens, TurnerelU, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Lawrence, Romney, the Smiths of Chiehester, &c. The most noticeable painting is what is caUed the \"Cenotaph of Lord Darnley,\" husband of Mary Queen of Scots, representing his murder, &c, painted in 1567, and brought hither by the Lennox family from the Chateau d'Aubigny. In the grounds of Good wood is a modern erection which covers a Roman inscription"], [118, "72 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. found at Chiehester in 1731, in digging the foundations for the councU-chamber. It is a dedication of a temple to Neptune and Minerva, of the date of Tiberius. (See Chiehester.) This is the most interesting rebc of the Roman dominion in Sussex. The Goodwood races, so widely celebrated, are held in this domain, about a mUe from the house. They were established here in 1802, and they are considered at least equal to Epsom and Ascot. In this brief article we must not omit to notice the beautiful timber on the Goodwood estate. The chesnut avenue in the deer park at Halnaker, the cedars of Lebanon more than 150 in number in Goodwood park, the fine beeches on the race-hill, two large cork-trees, and the deciduous cypresses (the latter in the High- wood), wiU aU attract the attention of every arborist and artist.

The name is Saxon \u2014 Brymm burh, a hiU fortification. This accurately describes the situa tion of its castle, of which now a picturesque fragment only remains. It was the possession of the great Norman family of De Braose, kinsmen of the Conqueror. The river Adur flows at its foot. The question of the Portus Adumi has long been discussed by antiquaries, but I am fully convinced that at Bram ber we find the true site of that Roman station. A considerable estuary of the English Channel formerly ran up to this point ; and at some unascertainable period it gave name to the Rape of Bramber, one of the six divisions of the county. The original"], [119, "73 BRAMBER. area of the fortress occupied a kind of irregular oval, measuring 560 feet from north to south, and 280 feet from east to west. A full pedigree of the noble family of Braose, from the time of the Conquest down to the reign of Richard IL, is given by Cartwright. This great family, from whom descended the royal Braces of Scotland, originated at Brieuze, near Falaise in Normandy. William de Braose, one of the Conqueror's com panions, was rewarded with 41 manors in Sussex, besides others in Dorsetshire and Hampshire, and he endowed the abbey of Saumur with the churches of Bramber, Shoreham, Sele, and St. Peter at Vipont. On this occasion the monks of Saumur sent over some of their brethren to England, who fixed them selves at Sele, afterwards known as Beeding Priory. The great famdy of Braose were distinguished in the grand historical annals of Norman times, and were conspicuous as eminent barons, crusaders, and sometimes rebels ; but it is beyond our present scope to enter into the detailed history of this iUustrious house. They had lands in many English counties and in Wales. From the De Braoses, Bramber descended to the great family of De Mowbray, who held it for several genera tions, and played a considerable part in the annals of the king dom. Thomas de Mowbray was distinguished for his high and important offices and for his perfidious character. He was a Knight of the Garter, and in 1397 was created Duke of Norfolk. Of the importance of this family it is sufficient to state that four of its representatives were honoured with the Knighthood of the Garter in lineal succession. From the Norman Conquest to the reign of Richard III., a period of 418 years, the honour of Bramber was held by 24 persons \u2014 15 Braoses and 9 Mow brays. From the Mowbrays the Honour of Bramber devolved on the Howards, Dukes of Norfolk, with whom Bramber has descended, as Arundel. The manor of Bidlington extends into the parishes of Stey ning, Beeding, Old Shoreham, and Cowfold. (Cartwright.) A small hospital, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen, existed here in charge of a prioress, down to the year 1553. Salt-pans for merly existed on the estuary of the Adur. Bramber was a borough, ancl sent members to Parliament from 26 Edward I., till the Reform Act of 1832. This was one of the most rotten of boroughs, the voters being only 18 in number, and they mostly resided in thatched cottages. A story is told of the village innkeeper, that he once made out a biU to one of the candidates thus :\u2014 \" To 100 dinners, \u00a3100; to sundries, \u00a3200.\" This being the price of his vote. Thebenefhe was given in 1075 to the monks of Saumur. Its patronage ha^ descended, with the other English possessions of"], [120, "74 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. that estabUshment, to Magdalen CoUege, Oxford. In conse quence of its impoverishment from frequent incursions of the sea, Bishop Sherburne, in 1530, annexed it to the vicarage of Botolphs. The church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, contains many interesting Norman features, though it is evidently only part of the original structure ; and there are memorials for the names of Prescott, Davey, Green, Lidbetter, &c. The Lidbetters were lessees of Maudlin Farm, from Magdalen CoUege, for about three centuries. An ancient bridge, presumed to be of Roman origin, crossed the river Adur between this parish and Beeding. Upon it stood a chapel. The history of this structure has been given by the Rev. E. Turner, in the \" Sussex Collections.\" In 1368 John, Bishop of Chiehester, granted an indulgence of forty days to aU who contributed to the repair of this edifice. [S. A. C.

Chief Landowner, Thomas Frewen, Esq. The manor of Brede comprises part of the town of Hastings. It derives its name from that of the now smaU river Brede, which forms its southern boundary. In former times that stream was of much greater width \u2014 a broad stream \u2014 and hence the Anglo- Saxon bred or brad was applied to it. A detached part of the parish caUed Little Brede hes nearer to Rye, the intercepting parish being Udimore. It is weU wooded, about one-fourth of the area being woodland ; there are also many acres of hop garden. The sea has made great inroads on this parish, and the Non\u00e6 records of 1341 state that great part of the marsh called Gaberghes had been submerged."], [121, "75 BREDE Brede Place, a mansion of considerable antiquity and much picturesque beauty, belongs to Thomas Frewen, Esq., of Brick waU. The estate belonged, temp. Richard II. , to John atte Forde, and passed in the 15th century to the family of Oxenbridge, who seem to have originated at Rye, and the name frequently occurs in the records of that town. One of the family, John Oxen bridge, who died in 1522, was a Canon of St. George's chapel at Windsor, and founded a chantry there. To this family also be longed another John Oxenbridge, a well-known Puritan minister, who graduated B.A. at Oxford in 1572. In the register of Trinity Church, Coventry, where he lies buried, he is described as a \" grave and reverend preacher ;\" he died in 1617. A branch of this family went to New England, and though the name is extinct in the Old World it still exists in the New. The old part of the mansion is described by Parker (Domestic Arch., iii, 314) as \" of stone, with good foliated windows, and two fine chimneys, one at each end corbelled out, and with octagonal shafts battle mented.\" The Elizabethan part is of brick, with stone dress ings. The mansion has no hall, but the chapel, which has some architectural peculiarities, still remains. The church was anciently connected with Steyning, and both were part of the possessions of the Norman abbey of Fecamp. It is dedicated to St. George, and consists of chancel, nave, and aisles. The capitals of the columns are foliated. The east end ofthe south aisle was a chantry belonging to Brede Place. There is some ancient painted glass, including the arms of Echingham, that famdy having been formerly influential in Brede. There are inscriptions for the families of Horne, Hele, and Oxenbridge. Against the south wall of the Brede Place or Oxenbridge chapel is an altar-tomb dated 1537, with the recumbent figure of a man in armour with a lion at his feet. There is also another altar tomb to a member of the same family, but without arms or date. On the pavement is a brass with the figures of 3\u00a3oJ)rrt \u00a9xm= Jlritijje and Anne his wife, and the dates 1487 and 1483. The tower contains six beUs, one of which is dedicated to St. Thomas. The living of Brede was long in the patronage of the famUy of Horne, one of whom, George, was the celebrated theologian and Biblical expositor, and Bishop of Norwich. The manufacture of iron was formerly carried on in this parish to a great extent. It ceased about the year 1766, and that of gunpowder succeeded. Many cannons were exported by way of Rye to the Continent. Among the legendary lore of East Sussex, a story of the wUd est kind was told. One of the Oxenbridgeswas an Ogre, and constantly dined upon young children. He lived in the days of"], [122, "76 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. bows and arrows, but was invulnerable. The only means of getting rid of him was to cut him in two with a wooden saw ! His neighbours manufactured such a tool, made him drunk, and then quietly cut him asunder. This \"wise saw\" took place in Stubbs's Lane, at a place stiU known as \" Groaning Bridge.\" [S. A. C. Iron-works, ii, 207. xviii, 15. King Edward I. at, ii, 142.

Seats, Rose Hill, Thomas Wilson, Esq., leased from Fuller Meyrick, Esq. ; Brightling Place, Henry Atherton, Esq. Brightling is situated on an elevated portion of the Forest ridge, and is one of the most romantic and picturesque spots in East Sussex. BrightUng Down rising to the height of 646 feet above the level of the sea is well known through the effective but highly exaggerated picture of Turner. RosehiU, which has been in the Fuller famUy since the year 1697, now belongs to O. J. A. FuUer Meyrick, Esq. Up to 1833 (the date of his death) it was the property of the eccentric John FuUer, Esq., M.P., a weU-known patron of arts and artists, who erected an observa tory and several other ornamental buildings in the park and grounds, and who lies buried under a pyramid in the church yard. (See \"Sussex Worthies,\" p. 96.) The Fullers, like many other Sussex proprietors, added to their wealth by the iron trade, whence the motto assumed by Mr. Fuller, \" Carbone et forcipi bus.\" Another family of iron-masters were the Collinses, of Socknarsh manor in this parish, who became extinct in 1753."], [123, "77 BRIGHTON. The rectory of Brightling was the corpus of a prebend in the free chapel in the Castle of Hastings, founded in early Norman times. It has still manorial rights, and has belonged for several generations to the family of Hayley. Of these was the Rev. WU- Iiam Hayley, patron, rector, and prebendary, a most diligent col lector of materials for the history of East Sussex, who died 1789, bequeathing his MSS. to the British Museum. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 155.) William of Wykeham held this prebend ante 1362, and his arms appear in a spandrel of the chancel door. The church, dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket, consists of a square embattled tower, containing eight beUs, a nave, and a north aisle, the eastern end of which forms a chapel, and a chan cel. The east window was formerly filled with painted glass. The church contains many memorials of the famUies of Colbns, English, and Glyd. The most remarkable inscription is a brass plate to foil's S 13atMMDS, gentylman, 1476, who gave to this church ornaments, pavements, and all the seats (sediUa), and also left the lands caUed Levetts for the benefit of the fabric. Some in terested person afterwards removed thebrass,andit was discovered at the bottom of a deep weU on the South Downs. On its recovery it was replaced in the church, and proceedings were instituted in 1635 for possession ofthe lands, which are now appropriated to their original use. This parish was severely visited by the plague in 1665. [S. A. C. Iron-works, ii, 207. iii, 241, 245. Chancel built by Wm. of Wykeham, xiii, 145. Church bells, xvi, 201. Atkins, xvii, 33.

Few things are less to the taste of the antiquarian topogra pher than the description of places, which, though ancient them selves,havesuddenlyspranginto an importance disproportionedto their geographical area, and are comparatively devoid of histor ical interest. The developement of an obscure \" fisher town\" into one of the greatest centres of wealth, pleasure, and fashion known in the world's history, and that within the brief span of a"], [124, "78 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. single century, is a phenomenon which presents more attractions for the social philosopher than for him who would record with careful pen the origin and gradual growth or decay of our towns, viUages, families, manors, castles, churches, and such like, within a given county or district. Brighton will, therefore, occupy a brief number of these pages, since to make either the population which it possesses, or the popularity which it enjoys, a standard of length in description, would be altogether at variance with the design of these volumes. Much useless labour has been spent upon the etymon of Brighthelmston. It is clearly the tun or enclosure of Bright helm, some Saxon settler here, but of his precise period or rank we shaU probably never know anything. In Domesday, Bristel mestune is described as having been held before the Conquest by one Brictric, afterwards by Ralph, of William de Warenne. It was then a fishing place, and 4,000 herrings were paid to the lord as rent. Widard is described as another tenant. A second manor was held of De Warrenne by William de WatevUle. These, from their having subsequently become the property of the priories of Lewes and Michelham, are now known as Brighthelmston-Lewes, and Brighthelmston-Michelham. The third manor, Atlingworth, evidently received its name from some Atheling, its previous Saxon proprietor. Three minor manors, called Harecourt, Peakes, and Erlees, extend into the parish. The manor of Brighthelmston-Lewes foUowed the des cent of the Barony of Lewes, until, after a variety of transfers of no historical interest, it became two moieties, one of which was ultimately purchased by the Kemp family \u2014 and hence \" Kemp Town,\" \u2014 the other by Mr. Charles Scrase, an eminent solicitor, from whom it has descended to Charles Scrase Dickins, Esq., of Coolhurst. Brighthelmston-Michelham was given by Queen Elizabeth to her kinsman, Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, in whose descendants it stiU vests. Atlingworth descended to the family of Attree, of Brighton Park. A fanciful notion exists that Brighton once received a colony of Flemings, and that their descendants may be traced in the Brighton fishermen of to-day. After careful enquiry, I see no foundation whatever for such belief. The fisherman doubtless contrasts strongly with the half-cockneyized mechanic on shore, but there is no real distinction in language or habits, beyond what a difference of pursuit, and the technicalities of a daily calUng would produce. At Dieppe, a similar error prevails as to the fishermen of the \" Pollet, \" a suburb of that town. Soon after the donation of Brighthelmston manor to Lewes Priory, the monks of that establishment founded a kind of cell or chantry here, and dedicated it to St. Bartholomew. This is"], [125, "79 BRIGHTON. said to have been destroyed during an attack of the French in 1513. John, eighth Earl de Warenne, in 1313 obtained a grant for a weekly market on Thursday. The fisheries carried on in the German Ocean at Yarmouth and Scarborough attracted the men of the town in this and the succeeding centuries. In 6th Henry VIII. (1513), the celebrated \" Prior John\" \u2014 so the chronicler is pleased to speU Messire Pregent \u2014 commander of a French squad ron, \" came a land,\" says Hall's Chronicle, \" in the night, at a poore viUage in Sussex caUed bright Helmston, and sett fyer on the towne, and toke suche poore goodes as he fownde.\" The watch, however, fired the beacons, got together a troop of Bright helmstonians, and routed Prior John. One of the archers shot him in the face so seriously that on his reaching Boulogne \" he offered his image of wax before our Lady, with the English ar row in his face, for a miracle.\" The next attack upon Brighthelmston occurred in 1545, during the rupture between Henry VIII. and Francis I. Claude d'Annebalte, high Admiral of France, in command of the French \" Channel fleet,\" made a descent and burnt a considerable por tion of the town. A plan of the attack, preserved in the British Museum, and reproduced in the Arch\u00e6ologia, Vol. xxiv, represents the town as quadrangular, with four or five streets only. Parties of armed men are shown coming into the town, from the Lewes and Poynings roads. To the north-west of the church is seen the beacon, and to the east of the town a great cresset or fire cage. Not only Brighthelmston itself, but both these danger signals are \" all ablaze ;\" the foreshore is crowded with galleys landing troops, while \" grete shippes \" occupy the offing. In the middle of the town, is a \" felde \" or open square, reminding us of the Steynes of our own times. The plan shows no defences ; but a few years after this attack, 1st Elizabeth, 1558, a smaU circular fort or \" block-house,\" 50 feet in diameter, and a few walls were set up. The latter were pierced with gates, caUed respectively Eastgate, the Portal, Middlegate, and Westgate, answering to the main streets, and conducting towards the maritime part of the town, which then lay in two or three mean streets below the cliff. The advisers of Queen Victoria seem to be less careful of magnificent Brighton than were those of Queen Elizabeth of the \" poore viUage.\" The \" modern Bai\u00e6,\" with her four miles of sea palaces, unequalled in the world, pre sents the finest imaginable target for a hostile fleet of iron-clads ; but even its one battery has been pulled down, while a quarter of a miUion is being expended in fortifying the httle tidal port of Newhaven. Andrew Borde, in 1542, reckons \" Brighthampsted \" among the noble ports of England, though the epithet is utterly inap propriate."], [126, "80 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Gradually the ocean ate away the shores of Brighton and de stroyed its port and its defences, though up to the middle of the last century considerable remains of the last-mentioned existed. In 1579, the fishing-boats numbered four-score, manned by 400 able mariners, who possessed 10,000 nets ; but at a later date this valuable trade fell into a miserable state of de cay. It is now, however, considerable. The greatest historical event connected with Brighton is the escape from England of King Charles IL, who, subsequently to his disastrous defeat at Worcester, 3rd September 1651, came after many tortuous journeys and hair-breadth escapes, to this town, on October 13th, and sailed the next day in a coal-brig commanded by Nicholas Tattersal, who conveyed him safely to Fecamp. The King took up his temporary abode at the George Inn, in West Street. After the Restoration the coal-brig was raised to the dignity of a fifth-rate man of war ; Tattersal, her master, to that of Captain ; and the little tavern, olim the George, to that ofthe King's Head, which it still enjoys. Tattersal lies buried in the church-yard with a laudatory inscription. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 297.) We have not space fuUy to detail the series of misfortunes which Brighthelmston underwent for many years : foreign pri vateers took its fishing-boats ; the sea continued its encroach ments , and the olim poor town became more poverty-stricken still : so much so, that it was compelled to appeal to four adja cent parishes for the sustentation of its pauper population. To add still further to its calamities, Brighton suffered severely from the great storm of November 1703, which damaged the church and many houses, destroyed two windmiUs, and wrecked many vessels belonging to the townsmen. Another storm of al most equal violence took place in 1705, and it was estimated in 1738 that 130 tenements, worth nearly \u00a340,000, had been de stroyed within the previous forty years by the ravages of the sea. The under-cliff suburb had graduaUy disappeared, and the fishermen became inhabitants of the town itself, the poverty of which was now truly deplorable. Little did the poor Brighto nians wot of the briUiant future which awaited their weather beaten town. Prosperity however was at hand, and Dr. Richard RusseU was the morning star wliich heralded the better con dition of things. This gentleman, the son of a Lewes apothecary, after having learnt medicine at Leyden, devoted himself to the study of glandular disease, and the curative effects of sea bathing. Brighthelmston being situated at a convenient distance from his residence at Lewes, he sent his patients thither, wrote learned tractates, got baths and lodging-houses built for his patients, and so invented Brighton, Dr. RusseU died at the age of 72, in London, in 1757. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\""], [127, "81 BRIGHTON. page 59.) Dr. Relhan, an Irish physician, succeeded him, and ably sustained the reputation of Russell's practice. In 1761 he published a short history of the town, with remarks on its air and waters. At this period the almost infinitesimally small space between the East, West, and North Streets included \" Bredhempson town,\" the population not much exceeding 2,000 souls. From that time \" Brighton \" became its accepted name, though it had long before been thus abbreviated among the natives. I have seen the modern form in documents ofthe time of Charles II. Brighton soon became the summer resort of several scions of royalty and nobility, and in 1782, George, Prince of Wales, after wards George IV., then a young man of twenty, made it his favourite retreat. Two years later the prince erected a \"PavUion,\" the germ of the present bizarre and unexampled structure, of which Brightonians somehow manage to be proud. It was buUt from designs by Nash, and purchased by the town of the Com missioners of Woods and Forests, in 1849, for \u00a353,000, and many thousands have since been expended on it. It contains an exceUent museum, which comprises the valuable coUection of chalkand otherfossils amassed by Henry WiUett,Esq. Up to this period the fishermen had built their boats and mended their nets on the Steyne, then a common waste, but which now, in comphance with the wishes of the Prince, the Duke of Marl borough, and other magnates, was reserved and enclosed. Within the enclosure of the Steyne are a fine bronze statue of George IV. by Chantrey, and a handsome fountain. Brighton contains also, other turfed enclosures or \" lungs,\" particularly the Level, the ancient bed of the WeUsbourne, and the New Steyne. During the French war (1793) an encampment of 10,000 troops was formed at Hove, and in the following year another of 7,000 men took place. The so-called Brighton barracks for cavalry are in the parish of Preston Episcopi. To describe modern Brighton in its vast growth and develope ment, with its 400 streets and squares, would occupy a volume larger than this. Its population comprises more than a fourth part of the inhabitants of Sussex. A few particulars must suffice, especially as innumerable guide-books, accessible to everybody, will supply all necessary information. Brighton since its incorporation has been governed by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Town Council. Previously, by the Reform Act of 1832, it had become a borough, returning two members. The formation of the London and Brighton Railway bringing this modern Bai\u00e6 into such close proximity to the metropolis, has acquired for it the name of London-super-Mare. The three great promoters of Brighton's prosperity then, have been, first Or"], [128, "82 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Dr. Russell and sea-bathing, secondly, George IV. and fashion, and thirdly the Railway, which has opened up the whole county and given employment to many hundreds of the inhabitants. Although the town has no longer a haven, it has two piers. The first of these, the Chain Pier, built on the suspensionprinciple, in 1 823, by Captain Samuel Brown, R. N., is probably the most elegant, as it is the earliest, structure of its kind. The West Pier, however delightful as a promenade, has little beauty to recom mend it ; it was opened in 1866. From both these advanced points a magnificent view of the palatial frontage of Brighton is obtained. A sea-wall, which cost nearly \u00a3100,000, now defends the town from the inroads of remorseless Neptune. The buildings of the town have extended themselves west ward into the adjoining parish of Hove, in which is a large and pleasant suburb called Cliftonville, somewhat ridiculously, since there is no cliff, and ville is mere surplusage. On the east cliff rises the magnificent range of houses called Kemp Town, from Thomas Read Kemp, Esq., formerly M.P. for Lewes, on whose es tate it was built. The principal secular buildings in Brighton be sides the Pavilion, are its grand Town Hall, the Sussex County Hospital, the College, and the New Workhouse. There are also many charitable institutions, and establishments for educational purposes. Brighton has been caUed the \" city of schools,\" and it has been asserted that not less than 700 heads of families, ranging from the clerical tutor to the mistress of the dame's school, derive their subsistence from this source. A large ceme tery, abounding with costly monuments, Ues to the north of the town, on the Lewes road. The parish church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, occupies an elevated site, and forms a sea mark, but possesses few features of ecclesiological interest. It is partly in the Perpendicular style, but has been much patched and modernized. There is a memo rial to the late Duke of Wellington, besides many inscriptions for the names of Sneyd, Scrase, Tidy, Kipping, Pascal, Hobart, Randall, Atkinson, Leigh, Mansfield, Stanley, Gwynne, Met calfe, Biddulph, Coxe, Carter, Wagner, &c, &c. The font is of late Norman date, with figures in relief, representing the Last Supper, and other subjects. In 1745 the churchwardens in scribed their names upon it, which has thrown discredit upon its real antiquity. In the churchyard are memorials for Captain Nicholas Tattersal, previously mentioned, for Martha Gunn, the weU-kaown sea-bather, and for Ph\u0153be Hessel, who long served as a private soldier, and died in 1801, aged 108 years. The church is supposed to have been built within a Druidical en closure, as within the last century many large rude stones were lying around it."], [129, "83 BRIGHTON. The religious wants ofthe increasing population of Brighton, have ever been promptly met by the erection of new places of wor ship, as auxiliaries to the parish church, and for the use of the various bodies of nonconformists. The following are the churches and chapels of ease, with their dates and incumbents : \u2014 Chapel Royal, North-street, 1793, Eev. T. Trocke, M.A., Surrogate.

St. Michael's Church, Victoria-road, 1862, Rev. C. Beanlands, M.A. St. Anne's Church, Burlington-street, 1863, Bev. A. Cooper, M.A. Annunciation Church, near North Level, a branch of St. Paul's. St. Bartholomew's Church, Providence-place, connected with St. Paul's. Many of these fabrics would find small mercy at the hands of the ecclesiological critic. St. Peter's, a picturesque, though architecturally incorrect building, is from designs by Barry. St. Paul's and All Saints have their columns and tracery much too slender. St. Michael's resembles a continental hotel-de-ville, and, as to several of the rest, they vary from the pagan-temple style to carpenter's gothic, one or two being, by way of variety, ofthe music-hall order. The nonconformist sanctuaries are 32 in number, and shelter under a great variety of exterior aspects almost every creed recognized among Englishmen. Like the episcopal churches above enumerated, they have little historical interest, with one exception. The Countess of Huntingdon's chapel in North-street was erected by the zealous and energetic lady whose name it bears, with the proceeds of her jewels and personal ornaments. Among notable persons who have been connected with Brigh ton are Derick Carver, the Sussex proto-martyr of the Marian persecution, burnt at Lewes in 1555 ; Stephen Gratwicke, burnt in Southwark 1557 ; John Grover, the self-taught mathematician and schoolmaster, ob. 1752 ; Thomas Read Kemp, founder of g 2"], [130, "84 HISTORY OF SUSSEX.

This parish, on the Coast, includes the populous town of Worthing (which see), and has a small outlying portion adjacent to Horsham called Sedgwick (which see). At the time of the great Survey the manor was held of William de Braose, by one Robert, whose descendants it would appear were long known as its lords by the family name of Le Sauvage. An heiress, temp. Henry III., carried it to Sir John de Gaddesden. His daughter and heiress married Sir John de Camoys ; but afterwards forming an intrigue with Sir William Paynell, her husband by deed quit claimed her person and her goods to the latter knight. After Paynell's death, she had the impudence to claim dower on the estate of her injured husband which however, the Parliament of Lincoln in 1301 disallowed. Ralph, successor of John de Camoys, obtained in 1313 a charter for a market and fair, and had summons to Parliament. His descendant, Thomas, married Elizabeth Mortimer, widow of Henry Percy, commonly known as Hotspur. Male issue failing, the estate devolved on his grand-daughters, Margaret, wife of Sir Robert Radmyld, and Eleanor, wife of Sir Roger Lewknor. From the Radmyld family"], [131, "85 BROADWATER. the estates passed to the Gorings of Burton, and Broadwater was alienated. In the reign of Henry VII., Sir Reginald Bray had it, and it has subsequently passed into the hands of Shirley, Pretyman, Hungerford, Travies, Butler, and Newland. Offington was originally of much more importance than at present. Its name bespeaks its Saxon origin, Offa \u2014 inga \u2014 tun, the abode of the offspring of Offa \u2014 a common personal name. It is mentioned in Domesday as being held of William de Braose by WiUiam Fitznorman. In the 13th century it gave name to the family of De Offington, to which probably belonged the stout abbot of Battel, Hamo de Offington, who so bravely repulsed the French at Winchelsea in 1377. In the 14th cen tury the Peverels were in possession, and their ultimate heritors were the Wests. Sir Thomas West married the sister and heiress of John, Lord la Warre. Reginald, his son, succeeded as Lord la Warre. Offington became the chief residence of this great family, and Broadwater church their burial place. Two of the Barons, both named Thomas, were Knights of the Garter. The former was a great asserter of the Lancastrian claim, and was made K.G. by Henry VIII. By his will he directed his collar and chain to be sold for the benefit of the poor, and his velvet mantle and gown to be made into altar cloths for the church. The latter, who was \"gartered\" by Edward VI., had the later years of his life embittered by the unnatural conduct of his nephew and heir, William, who tried to compass his death by poison. For this offence he was disqualified for succession by Act of Parliament, 3rd Edward VI., but restored in blood by Elizabeth. Towards the end of her reign he sold Offington to John Alford, Esq., whose descendants sold it in 1726 to William Whitbread, gentleman, from whom it passed by bequest to the family of Margesson, and from them by sale to J. T. Daubuz, Esq. It is now the property and seat of Major Gais ford. It is a commodious mansion, though much shorn of its original magnitude. By an inventory of the chattels of the last Thomas, Lord la Warre, who was accounted \" the best house keeper in Sussex,\" it appears that it contained 65 bed-rooms and 98 bedsteads. There are some remains ofthe ancient chapel. It has a small park with some venerable trees. On the Offington estate, near the north extremity of the parish, is Cissbury, an ancient earthwork, consisting of a ram part and trench following the course of the hill, and enclosing about 60 acres of land. It belongs to the same class of works as Caburn, Chanctonbury, and Rooke's Hill, all cresting the South Down ridge. Cissbury is by far the most important of these ; but of its history nothing is known. Roman remains have been found in and near it, and the Romans may have used"], [132, "86 HISTORY OF SUSSEX, the spot, commanding as it does an extensive prospect, as a point of observation ; but these works are probably older than Rome itself. That Cissa, the founder of Chiehester and of the South Saxon kingdom, may have made it his \" bury \" or fort on some occasion, is not improbable. These remarkable works being usually remote from water, and therefore quite unsuited for pro longed defence, my own conviction is that they were sacred enclosures belonging to the cultus of some primeval race, per haps earlier than Druidism. The oldest forms of idolatry were associated with \" high places,\" and these works may have been constructed for religious, rather than for military purposes. The view from Cissbury is magnificent. The church is a large, rich, and very handsome structure, dedicated to St. Mary, and consists of a nave with north and south aisles and north porch, central tower with north and south transepts, and chancel. It is principally of Transition-Norman date, but has Decorated and Perpendicular additions. An eccle siological account of this very interesting building would exceed our plan. It formerly had a chantry for the De Camoys family. There are numerous monuments and inscriptions. In the chancel is a fine brass to ffoljn JSlaptltOJt, rector, who was chan cellor to Queen Margaret of Anjou, and died in 1435. A brass plate to Ctorlip, rector, 1415. A beautiful cross fleury, supposed of Richard Tooner, rector, 1445, legend \u2014 \"Sanguis Xpi salva me. Passio Xpi conforta me.\" Inscriptions for the names and families of Alford of Offington, Whitbread, Henley, Wade, Dodson, Penfold, Chester, Burton, Eversfield, Margesson, &c, &c. The chief monumental ornament is the elaborate tomb of Thomas, Lord la Warre, 1526. It is in the mixed Gothic and Italian style, which prevailed at the so-called renaissance; but from the elaborateness of the carving, and the amount of gold and colour with which it was originally decked, it must have had a gorgeous effect.

Most of the parish is in Kent, but the church was in Sussex, and its remains were visible in 1637. At an early period it was a place of consider able importance, and it is still a member of the Cinque Port of New Romney. According to one of the Dering MSS., quoted by Harris, the historian of Kent, it was a large town with above fifty inns and taverns ; but Camden describes it as \" a little populous village.\" The parish has been invaded at various times by incursions of the sea, the first on record being about the year 1280. Though its still existing area is 3,580 acres, the population in 1861 was only 102. BROOKSIDE. This name, well known to the hunting public for its \" crack \" pack of harriers, is a district lying on the banks of the Ouse between Lewes and Newhaven, and comprising the parishes of Kingston, Iford, Rodmell, Southease, and Pidding hoe. These are all on the west side of the river ; but I think that the parishes on the east bank were formerly reckoned Brookside parishes, viz. : \u2014 Beddingham, Tarring, Heighton, and Denton. The word brook is applied in Sussex not to an ordinary rivulet, but to the marshes formed by the deposit of alluvium near the courses of rivers, and Verstegan informs us that Brus sels (Bruxelles) is so called on account of its surrounding marshes.

This building is much more venerable for its antiquity than its adopted mother church of Ashington. It is of Norman date and of high interest, both for its architectural features and its picturesque situation. Many Roman tiles are introduced as material into the walls.

It belonged successively to the Dawtreys, St. Johns, Dykes, and Gorings. From the last mentioned it passed by marriage to the Biddulphs, the present proprietors. The ancient mansion of the Gorings was rebuilt in the reign of Elizabeth, and burnt down about 1756. Richard Biddulph, Esq., rebuilt it, but it was again partly destroyed by fire in 1826.

During great floods, Father Arun some times improvises a grand lake of a thousand acres in extent. The view from Bury hill is varied and extensive. From Domes day it appears that the abbey of Fecamp in Normandy held Bury of the Confessor, and afterwards of the Countess Goda. In 1392 the executors of Richard, Earl of Arundel, purchased it of that establishment and annexed it to the College of Arundel. The manor contains 5,500 acres, and belongs to the Duke of Norfolk. Thefamdy of Higgons were lessees in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Cookes were also resident here, temp. Elizabeth, on the marriage of Richard Cooke with the heiress of the Halls (de Aula) of Westburton. The church, dedicated to St. John, consists of a nave, north aisle, and chancel, with a tower and shingled spire, and is prin cipally Early English. It has been restored, and the chancel rebuilt. In the north window are the arms of Richard Earl of Arundel. One of the four bells is inscribed to St. Dunstan. Westbubton is a tything or hamlet to the west of the village.

Of this family were Henry, the ambitious and rebellious Bishop of Lincoln (see Worthies of Sussex, p. 324), and Bartho lomew, 4th Baron Burghersh, a great warrior temp. Edward III., and one of the original Knights of the Garter. The latter is represented at this day by the Earl of Westmorland, who en joys the second title of Baron Burghersh. A younger branch ceased in an heir female, who married Thomas Chaucer, son of the poet. The site of the baronial residence was at a place called the Park. Holmshurst and Baseman's are other seats of antiquity, and Franchise was the abode of the Polhills, from whom sprang Edward Polhill, Esq., the theologian, born here 1617. The rectory house is one of the best and most pleasantly situated in the district. Burwash was notorious in the last century for the lawlessness of the lower portion of its population. Smuggling, sheep stealing, and burglary were rampant, and it was scarcely safe for a wayfarer to pass after nightfall over Burwash down. Things have subsequently changed for the better. Agriculture has improved, land has increased in value, and opulent families, attracted by the beauty of the situation, are choosing this for their homes. So writes Charles F. Trower, Esq., M.A., in an interesting article in the \" Sussex Collections,\" vol. xxi., and I can endorse his statements. Burwash Down, once so much dreaded, is now a little centre of civilization, and has its schools and its church (St. Philip), budt about three years since. The latter, situated on a lofty elevation, forms one of the most con spicuous objects in the surrounding district. In 3 Edward III. John de Brittany, Earl of Richmond, ob tained a charter for a weekly market, and two annual fairs for this manor, which afterwards belonged to the Pelhams, by grant from Henry IV.* There are, however, several minor manors within or inpinging on the parish, namely, St. Giles (wliich probably belonged to some ancient guild of that name), Wood knowle and Mottingden, the Manor of the Rectory, Roberts bridge, Echingham, the Prebendal Manor of Brightling, Pepplesham, and others.

The nave, chancel, and aisles have features of Early English and subsequent styles, and the whole was restored in 1856. The font is octagonal of the 15th century, and has the \" Pelham Buckle \" (see Laughton) on some of its faces: the same device was formerly worked in the tracery of the east window of the south aisle.

It includes part of the great forest of Ashdown, and hes on the sandstone of the Forest Ridge. The manor does not appear to be noticed in Domesday, but it was an early subinfeudation of that of Framfield, and was held during the reign of the earlier Edwards by the family of Marynes. After 6th Richard IL, it passed successively by inheritance or purchase to the fami-"], [139, "93 BUXTED. lies of De Saye, Lewknor, and Walleys. In 18th James I. it was bought by Richard and Edward Amherst, Esquires, and by them conveyed to the Lindsays, who, in 1651, sold it to the Penk hursts. On a division of Sir Ferdinand Penkhurst's estate, Hum phrey Fowle, Esq., became possessor, and he sold it with Buxted Place to Thomas Medley, Esq., from whom it descended to Julia Evelyn-Medley, who married the late Charles Cecil-Cope Jenkin son, Earl of Liverpool. On the partition of his Lordship's es tates, Buxted devolved on one of his three daughters and co heiresses, Lady Catherine, who married Colonel Harcourt, the present proprietor. Buxted Place is a solid brick edifice of the last century, and stands in a fine, well timbered deer-park. Hendall, an ancient estate in the parish, belonged in the 15th century to the Westons. Joan, the heiress of that family, married Thomas Pope, of the privy chamber to Henry VI., whose descendants continued in possession for several genera tions. Temp. Elizabeth it was the residence of a branch of the Pelhams. It is now annexed to the Buxted Place estate. The house, which occupies a commanding site, is of considerable antiquity. The village is small and scattered. The most noticeable of the houses is that known as the Hog-house, from its having on its front a stone carved with a rude figure of a hog, with the date 1581. The original house was the habitation of Ralph Hogge, a celebrated iron-founder, who had great works in the neighbourhood, and who, in conjunction with a Frenchman named Peter Baude, is believed to have cast the first cannon ever seen in Europe. This, according toHolinshed, was in 1543. The older ordnance was made of iron bars placed together with great compactness, and surrounded with strong hoops after the manner of a barrel ; but casting and boring before Hogge's time were unknown. The name of Hogge became corrupted to Hug gett, and it is worthy of remark that there have long been numerous Huggetts engaged in the honest trade of the black smith in East Sussex. Hugget's Furnace received its name from Ralph, and there is a local distich, which runs \u2014 \" Master Huggett and his man John, They did cast the first cannon.\" Buxted was, in fact, one of the chief centres of the Sussex iron trade ; and it may be noticed that Richard Woodman, the prince, so to speak, of Sussex Protestant Martyrs, a great iron-master at Warbleton, is believed to have been a Buxted man. (See Lower's \" Martyrs of Sussex,\" p. 13S.) In this parish there exists an old hermitage of considerable interest. It is situated on a farm which Dr. Anthony Saunders, a benevolent rector of Buxted, gave towards the foundation of a"], [140, "94 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. free-school at Uckfield, formerly a chapelry of Buxted, about the year 1718. The situation is rocky, and out of the principal rock some unknown devotee, at an unknown date, carved for himself a habitation, with several apartments. The place was known as \"The Vineyard,\" and on some of the adjacent sand stone rocks, remnants of perhaps medieval vines, still exist. It is a spot well worthy of inspection. The church (St. Margaret) stands near Buxted Place, on an agreeable elevation, with trees that add much to its beauty. It is a large, handsome building, of chancel, nave, with north and south aisles, the former having a chapel at the east end, with a piscina. The building is generally Early English, with later insertions. The chancel is in the Decorated style, and contains a handsome piscina, and a plaster roof ornamented with de vices of a later date. Over the north porch is a stone figure of a woman holding a large churn, which is sup posed to be a rebus on the name of Alchorne, a family once important in this part of Sussex. There is a west tower with a shingled spire and six bells. The mortuary memorials are most interesting. Near the middle of the chancel is the tomb of Sfoljan foe ILetofS, an ancient rector, of the 13th century. Near this is a brass comprising an elegant cross-fleuri, a demi figure of a priest, and the evangelistic symbols, to UritCllUS SEtoencl, rector here in 1375. At the entrance to the chancel is an inscription on a brass plate for the mother of an ancient rector, to the effect that Xffote Sabap \" both flesh and boone, lyeth graven under this stoon : Robert hire sone was parsone here more than 24 yeere.\" In the north aisle is a small muti lated half-figure in brass, of a priest with a chalice. According to the Burrell MSS. there were formerly brass memorials to Dominus Deonicius Sion, 1485 ; Thomas Smith, of Buxted, Esq., 1558 ; and John Warnett, fellow of Furnival's Inn, 1486. Some fragments of other brasses are preserved at the Rectory, an ex cellent moated house, which seems to have been rebuilt or re stored by Dr. Anthony Saunders, about 1694. There are more recent monuments for Dr. Anthony Saunders, 1719; Dr. Wil liam Wotton, 1726 ; George Medley, Esq., and others. William Heron, Lord Saye, by his will dated October 30th, 1404, directed the completion in this church of a Hospital, which he had al ready commenced, for six poor men, or four at least, with a chantry-priest to govern them, the priest to have for his support ten marks, and every poor man five marks yearly. No remains of this foundation are now traceable, except, perhaps, in the chapel before mentioned.

This parish lies chiefly on the gault formation of the Wealden beds, and produces some of the finest bricks and pot tery to be obtained in the south of England. The parish was formerly in a wild and uncultivated state, and contained two large commons, called respectively the north and south com mons ; but most of the land has been brought under cultivation by modern industry. Little is known of the early history of Chailey as a parish, though it appears as Chaggele in some ancient documents, as"], [143, "CHAILEY. 97 dependent on the manor of Street. From an inquisition post mortem of 31 Edward I., it appears that Giles de Plaiz died seised of the manors of Werpesburne (now called Wapsbourne) and Waningore, with the advowson of the church of Chailey, and that of the free chapel of Waningore. These had pre viously been held by Richard de Plaiz. Among the landed estates mentioned in ancient records is the Hooke, which gave name to the family of Atte Hooke. From the Exchequer records of 10 Edward II. we learn that Wdliam atte Hooke, who was charged with felony, had his estate seized for the king. Sub sequently to 1539 it passed to the families of Martin, Chatfield, Godley, and Langford. It was sold by the last-named family to William Poole, Esq., ancestor of the Rev.

On this com mon is a fine grove of trees, visible in every direction from a great distance. From its position in a central part of the county, it has been called the \" Navel of Sussex.\" In this parisb resided Mr. John Kimber, who died about the year 1818. He was an eccentric person, a farmer of the old school ; but a great lover of books, particularly those which abounded in illustrations. His learning, as Mr. Horsfield observes, was but superficial, and his bearing almost that of a peasant. He once bought a copy of Macklin's Bible, in six ponderous volumes, published at 80 guineas, and putting them into a sack, which he had brought to the bookseller's for that purpose, hoisted them to the back of one of his cart horses, and walked beside the animal and its precious burden in triumph to his home. He kept bis books in boxes, and he had a large collection of costly maps, globes, telescopes, and astronomical apparatus. He died an aged man, and, H"], [144, "98 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. according to a rustic Sussex custom, his mortal remains were conveyed to his grave at East Grinstead in his well-appointed wagon, drawn by his own team of horses, of which he had been particularly proud. The manor of Balneth lies in this parish. It belonged to the Priory of St. Pancras at Lewes, and was granted, temp. Edward VI., to Sir William Goring, to whose descendants it still be longs. The benefice was given by Henry VIII. to Anne of Cleves. The rectory-house has the singular appendage of a moat, whether for defence, or to provide the ancient parsons with fish during Lent, is uncertain. The church is small, and originally consisted of a nave, chancel, south aisle, and tower, which is crowned with a pyramidal spire of shingles. It is principally of Early English architecture. It was restored some years since, mainly at the expense of the families of Hepburn and Blencowe, who built a capacious north aisle. There is a fine yew-tree in the churchyard, which is most probably much older than the church itself. There are monumental inscriptions for the names of Middleton, Goring, Boucher, Poole, Porter, Ingram, Day, &c. The tower contains six bells, one of wliich bears the following inscription : \u2014 \" By adding to our notes weel raise, and sound the good subscribers' praise. \u2014 S. K., 1737.\" [S. A. C.

No tenant could pass its boundaries without special license from the lord, and then only on payment of two shillings, a considerable mulct in early times. This may account for a saying in the last age, that the \" Chantoners \" were all cousins, almost all intermarriages being with neighbouring families. From temp. Edward I. to Charles I., it belonged to the family of Sackville, and subsequently to the Traytons, Durrants, and Fullers. The church, dedicated to St. Bartholomew, is in the Decorated style, and consists of chancel, nave, and bell-turret of wood. In the east window is an inscription of the 14th century, stat ing that it was the gift of John Diliwyt, rector of the church. In another window is a painting of St. Thomas a Becket.

Vulgo, Chiddester ; the ecclesiastical Capital of Sussex, giving name to the Rape in which it stands. It is a post-town, and has a Railway station on the South Coast line. Its parishes form a portion of the West Hampnett union. It is the see of a Bishop, whose diocese is, with the exception of a few Peculiars of the Archbishop of Canterbury, co-extensive with the county. Ecclesiastical statis- tics are given below. Population in 1811, 6,426. In 1861, 8,045. The history of this ancient city has been so often written in various forms, from the elaborate quarto of Dallaway, down to the sixpenny guide book, that little can be added to what has already been given to the public. The last published account is that of the Rev. Mackenzie Walcott, B.D., Precentor of Chi ehester. (\"Memorials of Chiehester, 1865.\") Chiehester, the Regnum ofthe Romans, the city of Cogidubnus, king of the Regni, and legate in Britain of the Emperor Claudius, owes its present designation to the Anglo-Saxons. When Ella had founded his South Saxon realm in the fifth century, his son Cissa is reputed to have rebuilt this city on the old Roman site, and to have given to it the name of Cissan-ceaster, \" the fort or camp of Cissa.\" The principal streets follow the lines of a Roman camp, and answer to the four points of the coujpass. The Roman way called Stane Street passed from the Manwode through the city, and thence by Bignor and Billingshurst towards London. Vespasian, in a.d. 47, fixed his head quarters at or near this place. In 1723 the inscriptional stone of a Roman temple, dedi cated to Neptune and Minerva, was dug up on the site of the Council Chamber in North Street. It states that the ground was given by Pudens, who has been conjectured to be identical with the Pudens, whom, together withClaudia, St. Paul salutes"], [147, "101 CHICHESTER. in 2 Timothy, iv, 21, and whom Martial celebrates in an epi gram. The stone is preserved at Goodwood. In 967 King Edgar established a mint here, and in 992 the men of Chiehester routed the Danes who had landed on their coast. Specimens of Saxon pennies struck here are figured in S. A. C, vols. i and xx. At the time of the Domesday survey, the city had declined from its ancient importance, and contained apparently only one church and 283 houses. It had previously been held by Earl Godwin, father of Harold William the Conqueror gave the town and rape of Chiehester to Earl Roger de Montgomeri, who built a castle in the north-east quarter, while he gave the south-west for the site of the Cathedral, the see at this period having been removed from Selsey. This castle was seized in 1 184 by King John, and in 1216 Henry III. ordered it to be destroyed. King Stephen granted a charter, and in 1213 Chiehester was formally incorporated, probably on the basis of privdeges reaching back to Roman times. The intermittent stream called the Lavant passes round the east and south walls of the city (forming a kind of moat) on its way to Chiehester harbour. The walls, which remain almost entire, and stand upon the foundations of the Roman city, are 1^ mile in circuit. This wall was pierced with gates at the entrance of the north, south, east, and west streets, and some of these were standing at no remote date. The south-east quarter of the city, called the Pallant, was formerly subject to the Arch bishop of Canterbury. Like the city itself, it has its four streets answering to the cardinal points. Chiehester was formerly famous for its lobsters, and also for its manufacture of cloth, malt, and needles. Among the eminent persons associated with Chiehester, by birth or education, are Archbishops Bradwardine and Juxon, the poets Collins, Hurdis, and Hayley, and the well-known artists, the \" Three Smiths of Chiehester.\" John Selden (see memoir in \" Sussex Worthies,\") was educated at the prebendal grammar-school, founded by Bishop Story in 1497. Chiehester received royal visits from Henry III., Edward I., Elizabeth, and James II. In 1642 the Royalists entrenched themselves within the fortifications, but were surprised and routed by the forces of Sir William Waller, who made Chi ehester his head quarters. He quartered his troops within the cathedral precinct, and turned that venerable edifice itself into a stable for his cavalry. Before noticing the Cathedral, it may be well to mention the parish churches, most of which are very small and unimportant, and the medieval antiquities of the city. The churches are \u2014"], [148, "102 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Dedication. Patron. Incumbent. All Saint's Pallant, R. The Archbishop Rev. Geldart J. E. Riadore, M.A. St. Andrew, East-st., R.

St. Olave, rebuilt 1310, was partly constructed out of Roman materials. There were anciently three churches of St. Peter. The one now extinct was St. Peter-by-the-Guildhall, originally in the cathedral close. St. Andrew's is built over a Roman tesselated pave ment : the tomb of Collins the poet is in this church. The parishioners of the large parish of St. Peter-the-Great were, for some centuries, permitted to use the north transept of the cathedral as their church; but they are now accommodated in a handsome modern church in West-street, nearly opposite the cathedral. On the site of St. Bartholomew there formerly stood one of the few round churches constructed in England. It is figured and described in the \" Sussex Collections,\" Vol. v., as \" a Temple by Chiehester.\" The most remarkable medieval remains of the city are the following. In the north-east quarter is St. Mary's Hospital, founded in 1229, for a chaplain and 13 bedesmen. It has a chapel of the 13th century, 48 feet long, which is divided by a Decorated screen from a hall 83 feet in length. This is of the 14th century, and has a roof of enormous span. On each side is a kind of aisle divided into cells. This is altogether a most remarkable building. On the site of the Castle of the Mont gomeris stands the Chapel of the Grey Friars, who, upon the destruction of the fortress, took possession of the site. It is an interesting Early English building, and is now used as the Guildhall. The mound near at hand indicates either the Keep of the Castle or a \" calvary,\" probably the latter. The enclosure, which belongs to the Duke of Richmond, is used as a recreation ground by the citizens. The Hospital of St. James, founded for lepers, temp. Henry I., outside the Eastgate, is now represented by a small cottage near a bridge over the Lavant. At the junc tion of the four principal streets is a beautiful market-cross, 50 feet high, built by Bishop Story, about the end of the 15th cen tury. It has been pronounced one of the best specimens of its kind in England, but it has experienced sad disfigurements within the last two centuries. Kingsham, beyond Eastgate,"], [149, "103 CHICHESTER. the traditional residence of the Anglo-Saxon Kings of Sussex, was sometimes temporarily occupied by Edward I. and later sovereigns. Several of the principal houses in the city are attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. Among the public buildings are the Bishop's Palace, chiefly rather modern, but with a singularly interesting little chapel of early date ; the Deanery which is modern, and the Chantry and other medieval houses in Canon-lane, which are approached by an ancient gateway communicating with South-street ; the Council-chamber, North-street, built in 1731 \u2014 an extremely ugly specimen of the Georgian period ; Oliver Whitby's school for the instruction of twelve boys in navigation, &c, 1702 ; the Museum in South-street; the Train ing College, founded in honour of Bishop Otter, 1850, on the north side of the city ; the Market ; the Corn-exchange ; the Infirmary, without Northgate, a most useful and well-conducted institution ; and the Barracks, near the Broyle, to the north of the city, formerly occupied by the Guards, and now by the Sussex Infantry Mihtia. The Broyle was originally a great heath (bruillium), and marks of entrenchments of early date remain ; but it is now more or less cultivated and built upon. Chiehester is governed by a Mayor and Corporation. It has returned members to Parliament from the time of Edward I. It has given title to the families of Leigh, Wriothesley, Fitz- roy, and, since 1801, to the Pelhams, Earls of Chiehester. Our limits forbid a lengthened account of the Cathedral ; but the following brief abstract will be sufficient for general purposes. It stands in the south-west quarter of the city, and is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Its history is briefly this : \u2014 In 681 Wilfred, Bishop of York, having been driven from his see, settled for a time among the poor South Saxons in the peninsula of Selsey. With a few followers he established a kind of bishopric, and preached the Gospel to the Pagans. After him came a long succession of bishops, until the year 1083, when the see was removed from Selsey to Chiehester. It was many years, however, before the new cathedral was completed, and the episcopal foundation consolidated. Henry I. endowed it with various privileges. Earl William, in 1147, granted to the church a fourth-part of the city extending from the South to the West Gate, which included the site of the cathedral, the bishop's palace, and the whole close. This grant was confirmed by several successive monarchs. In 1108 Bishop Ralph consecrated the church ; but six years later it was burnt down, together with a great part of the city. It was partially re-built ; but in 1186, the church, with the palace, and the canons' houses, by another disastrous fire, was again destroyed. Bishop Seffrid II."], [150, "104 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. who died in 1204, re-built the cathedral at a vast expense. In 1210 the two west towers fell down. Bishops Neville and De la Wych (St. Richard), were great benefactors in the 13th century. Bishop Gilbert de St. Leofard, 1 268\u20141305, built the Lady Chapel to the eastward ofthe choir. Bishop Langton, 1305 \u2014 1336, built the great window in the south transept. No material event connected with the structure occurred until 1642, when the out rages committed by Waller's forces took place. After the Restoration a general repair was set on foot, and many subse quent efforts were made to strengthen the decaying edifice, but without much effect, for in February, 1861, the magnificent spire, together with its supporting tower, fell a mass of ruins, and tore away a bay of each transept and one bay of the nave and presbytery. Thanks, however, to the zeal of the cathedral authorities, aided by public liberality, the tower and spire have been replaced at an enormous cost, under the skilful superin tendence of Mr. Gilbert G. Scott, and ere long the reparations will be complete. There was an old traditional saying : \u2014 \" If Chiehester church-steeple fall, MMLn England there's no King at all\" \u2014 K which is true \u2014 since the calamity occurred during the reign of a beloved Queen ! As to the building, as it now stands, it has been a kind of fashion to decry it as one of the poorest of our cathedrals. If it wants the majesty of York, the aspiring proportions of Salis bury, or the peculiar beauty of Gloucester, it can boast of a symmetry truly mathematical which belongs to scarcely any other church in England. The following is a brief sketch of the cathedral and its monuments. Supposing the visitor to enter the building from the west, he will pass through a very beautiful Early English porch, probably the work of Bishop Sefirid, about a.d. 1200. On entering the nave the eye is at once caught by a peculiarity shared by no other English cathedral, namely, its five vistas \u2014 t|\u00e6 nave and its double aisles, north and south. Except YorJ^p_is-4\u00a7fc\u00a3he broadest cathedral in England. lip.' =^S The nave itself, and the next adjoining aisles, are Ther WorWif Bishop Ralph, as far as the top ofthe triforium. The clerei^Ky above, and the Purbeck marble shafts are Seffrid's addit^is. The two exterior aisles were added albout the time of St. Eichard, 1245 \u2014 1253, when it became necessary to make pro vision for extra chantries and shrines. The first two stories of the south-west tower at the end of #e nave may indicate a date earlier than Bishop Balph. The stained glass windows in the church are all modern\u2014 one of them is to the late Dean Chandler,"], [151, "105 CHICHESTER. a munificent benefactor to the fabric. In the Arundel chantry (north aisle) is the altar-tomb of Richard Fitz- Alan, 14th Earl of Arundel, beheaded in 1397. It was restored in 1843 by Richard son. It is related byHolinshed that Richard II. , having heard that this Earl's head had grown to his trunk again, caused the tomb to be opened after the interment. At the end of this aisle, in the chapel of the Baptist, is the tomb of an unknown lady. It is of extreme beauty, and of the Decorated period. Near at hand is a statue of Huskisson, by Carew, and a memorial win dow to the same illustrious statesman. The nave has several monuments by Flaxman. In the north aisle is that of Collins, the poet, who was born at Chiehester in 1721, and died here in 1759. The poet is bending over the New Testament. \"The Passions \" lie at his feet. In the south aisle are elegant tablets, with bas-reliefs by the same artist to Agnes Cromwell and Jane Smith. The screen which divided the nave from the choir, and was removed a few years since, was the work of Bishop Arundel (1458\u20141478). The choir stalls, given by Bishop Sherburne (1507 \u2014 1537), have also been removed. The choir is extremely narrow \u2014 the great defect of the building. The great window of the south transept was the work of Bishop Langton, 1305 \u2014 1358. It was originally filled with stained glass, which was destroyed by Waller's soldiery. Beneath it is the Bishop's tomb, much muti lated. Near it is a modern tomb with an effigy of John Smith, Esq., of Dale Park. On the north side, adjoining the choir, is the tomb of Bishop Richard delaWych (1245 \u2014 1253), afterwards known as Saint Richard, and widely celebrated throughout this diocese. The translation of the relics of this eminent prelate took place in 1276 in the presence of Edward I. and his court, and from that time to the date of the Reformation the shrine of St. Richard was the greatest object of pilgrimages and oblations in this part of England. For a summary of the life of this excellent personage see \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 242. The tomb has been restored by Richardson. This transept contains (or rather lately contained \u2014 for it is difficidt to say what the existing repairs may alter and remove*) some very curious wall paintings, the gift of Bishop Sherburne. On the east side are portraits of the Bishops of Selsey and Chiehester, from the foundation of the see. They are painted in roundels, and exhibit a striking \" family likeness.\" On the opposite wall were painted the monarchs of England from the Conqueror, and hence this transept is commonly known among the citizens as \" the Kings and Queens.\" Above this series is a picture in two compart ments \u2014 the first representing Ceadwalla, King of Sussex, bestow- * This was written in 1867."], [152, "106 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. ing the monastery of Selsey on St. Wilfred, and the second the confirmation of a grant by Henry VIII. to Sherburne. The work was executed in the early part of the 16th century by Theodore Bernardi, a Flemish artist of Italian extraction. The ancient consistory court over the south porch is entered by a spiral staircase in the nave. A sliding panel opens from this room into another called the \" Lollards' Prison,\" but which was more likely a room for muniments and archives. The sacristy, of Early English date, is entered from the transept, and contams an oak chest so rude and ancient that we may well believe the tradition that it is of Saxon date, and that it was brought hither from Selsey at .the removal of the see. East of the transept, in the south aisle, are fixed two sculptured slabs of extremely archaic character, and also said to have been brought from Selsey. The subjects are the Raising of Lazarus and our Saviour with Martha and Mary. The hollows in the eyes of the figures were probably filled with precious stones. The slabs were found in 1829 behind the stalls of the choir, and are, I think, certainly pre-Norman. Between these two ancient relics is the tomb of Bishop Sherburne, lately restored by the Society of New College, Oxon. Bishop Seffrid's restoration of Ralph's Church terminates in the choir. The eastern aisles, behind the choir, date about the end of the twelfth century. The central columns, with detached shafts, are extremely beautiful. The triforium exhibits a mixture of the circular and pointed styles. At the back of the altar-screen are monuments to Bishop H. King, Royalist and poet (1641-1669), and of Bishops Grove (1696) and Carleton (1705). A plain tomb on the north side commemorates Bishop Story, the builder of the market cross. In the chapel at the end of the north aisle is a bust of Bishop Otter. In the south aisle is a memorial window for Bishop Shuttleworth, 1842. The Lady Chapel forms the extreme eastern termination of the cathedral. It was built by Bishop Gilbert de St. Leofard (1288-1305). A coped tomb, inscribed Radulphus Episcopus, near the west entrance, is supposed to be that of Ralph, the founder of the original Norman church. Opposite are two other tombs, attributed to Bishops Seffrid and Hilary. This elegant chapel has been much disfigured by the closing of its great eastern window, and by the elevation of the floor for the formation of a vault beneath for the Dukes of Rich mond. It is now used as a chapter house and library. This part of the edifice is now under restoration as a memorial of the late Bishop Gilbert. There is a good collection of books, but no early MSS. of importance, and a small number of anti quities discovered in the cathedral, principally in the coffins of two bishops found under the choir arches, and supposed to be"], [153, "107 CHICHESTER. those of Seffrid II. and of Godfrey, second Bishop of Chiehester, who was consecrated by Archbishop Lanfranc. Among the relics from the second coffin is a leaden cross inscribed with a papal absolution. In the north aisle is a large canopied tomb, ascribed to Bishop Moleynes (1445-49), an adherent of Henry VI., who was treacherously murdered by the opposing faction at Portsmouth. The north transept of the cathedral was long used by the parishioners of St. Peter-the-Great, and has indi cations of very early Norman origin on the west side. The cloisters, which are entered from the south aisle of the nave, are of the Perpendicular period, with remarkable timbered roofs. Excellent general views of the church can be obtained from them. The area enclosed by the cloisters is called the Paradise. In the south cloister is a tablet to the memory of Chill ingworth, the champion of Protestantism, who died at the Palace here after the capture of Arundel Castle, in 1643, by Waller. Dr. Cheynell, his theological antagonist, appeared at the grave and flung into it Chdlingworth's \" Religion of Pro testants,\" at the same time anathematizing both book and author, and leaving them to \" rot and see corruption\" together. Oliver Whitby, the founder of the free school, also has a tablet here. The detached campanile, a striking feature of this cathe dral, has been referred to under Appledram. The stone is from Ventnor, Isle of Wight. The best view of the cathedral can be obtained from West Street. The original spire, which has been most faithfully copied in its minutest details in the new one, dated from the end ofthe thirteenth century. At the time of the construction of the church no spire was intended, and it is almost an archi tectural miracle that the piers, originally ill built and weak, and intended for no such superincumbent weight, should have borne its burden for almost 500 years. The height is 270 feet. From the dead level on which Chiehester stands, this spire is visible from a great distance by sea and land. The total length of the church is 410 feet. The breadth along the transepts, 227 feet. The cathedral constitution consists of a Dean and four Canons residentiary, who form the Chapter, and the usual staff of pre bendaries, minor canons, &c.

The name is Anglo-Saxon, and probably means \" the abode of the offspring of Caed, Chid, or perhaps Chad.\" At the time of Domesday, Ralph and Godwin held it of the Earl of Moreton, and among the property was a mill with the miller (a mere chattel !) yielding four shillings to the lords. In 12 Edward II. Nicholas de la Beche held it with many other manors. He was Constable of the Tower, and by writ of sum mons created a Baron by Edward III. From him it passed to his eldest sister and co-heiress, who married Sir Andrew Sackville the progenitor of the noble house of Dorset, whose heritors still possess it. Another manor, Birch, passed from Sir Michael Poynings, temp. Edw. III., through a great variety of pro prietors, to the family of Jefferay, and after their extinction by respective purchases to the Pelhams and Chatfields, and the yeomanry famdy of Guy. The Jefferays ramified extensively, but are now extinct. The most notable individual of the family was Sir John Jefferay, L.CB. of the Exchequer, who died in 1577, after having built the grand Elizabethan house called The Place, only a portion of which remains. (\" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 83.) Peakes was another mansion of the Jefferays, and Streame was the seat of the Frenches, great iron-masters. Burghill was the abode ofthe Millers ; Stonehill of the Elphicks ; Friths of the Chauntlers ; Burchetts of the Willards ; Shirley's of the Shirleys ; and Hale Green of the Torels and Calverleys. These are now occupied as farm houses or cottages, and so much has the former importance of the parish declined, that whereas seven carriages were once kept by as many of the resident aristocracy, there is now no family of that grade existing. The Dickee (wliich see) lies principally in this parish. Extensive ironworks were formerly carried on in Chiddingly. The church occupies a commanding site, and is a conspicuous object for many mdes. It consists of a nave, north and south aisles, chancel, and a tower surmounted by angle pinnacles and a lofty stone spire, 128 feet high. During the recent restorations fragments of Norman work were found : the present building is of Early English character, bordering on the Geometrical. The tower, which is ofthe fifteenth century, has \" Pelham Buckles.\" There are six bells. The monuments and inscriptions are numerous and interesting. One of these, erected in 1612, commemorating Lord C. B. Jefferay, his first wife, his daughter and heiress Elizabeth, and her husband, Sir Edward Montague, K.B., afterwards Baron of Boughton, with life-size statues and elegant ornamentation, is one of the finest in the county.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1652. Acreage, 2,185. Seat, Cobnor House, Colonel Bexford. The village is situated near the centre of a little peninsula, formed by the waters of the estuary called Chiehester Harbour. Like the neighbouring parish of Thorney, its acreage is a mat ter of high or low water. Several attempts at embanking and reclaiming soil of excellent quality have been made, but with no ultimate success. The history of the parish manorially and ecclesiastically is associated with the College of Bosham. This parish gives name to a very prolific and valuable species of corn, known as Chidham wheat. The original plant was dis covered by Mr. Woods while walking over his lands. It was growing in a hedge, and had thirty good ears and 1,400 grains ! By careful cultivation Mr. Woods made this extraordinary pro duction of a single grain multiply itself enormously, and it is now the favourite seed in many counties. A branch of the"], [157, "111 CHILTINGTON EAST. family of Tawke resided here in the 15th century, as at a more recent date did the Bickleys, for several generations. In 1404 some French marauders landed at Chidham, and carried off at least one of the parishioners. There are two small ty things in the parish called Easton and Weston. The church (Our Lady) is in the Early English style of architecture, with later insertions and additions. It consists of a nave, chancel, and north aisle, and contains inscriptions for members of the families of Bickley, Meggot, Edes, &c. [S. A. C. Prebend, of, viii, 193-4. xviii, 81, 82.

Seats, Stantons, Captain Bush Marten Cripps ; Northhall, Alexander Bhodes, Esq. This hamlet contains the two decayed mansions of Chapel House and Stantons, for many generations the residences of two branches of the ancient family of Challoner. The latter be came in the last century the property of the family of Marten. Earlier proprietors were John Ledys, temp. Henry VI., and Richard Farnfold, temp. Henry VII. A branch of the Sydneys formerly possessed the Manor of Wootton, to which there seems to have been attached a chapel of St. Giles. Hurst-Barnes or Berners is also an ancient site. Chiltington chapel consists of a western tower with a tiled roof, nave, and chancel, and has features of Norman architecture. Near it is a yew-tree, pro bably older than the chapel itself. This hamlet possesses great natural advantages and much picturesque beauty. It might, with a proper amount of enter prise, be improved, as it is excellently adapted for the residence of private families. The proximity of Plumpton station renders the spot very accessible from many points, and, no doubt, should the contemplated new line of radway from London to Brighton"], [158, "112 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. be carried through the hamlet, a kind of rural suburb to the latter place might be formed here.* [S.

Date of earliest Parish Register, 1558. Acreage, 3,917, of which nearly one-third is in the Rape of Bramber. This parish, which includes the hamlets of Broadford, Gaystreet, and Coneyhurst, is so called to distinguish it from East Chiltington, a hamlet of Westmeston, in East Sussex. Before the Conquest, Azor held the manor, which was rated at six hides. At the time of Domesday three of these were in the fee of Arundel, and the other three in the Rape of William de Braose ; and that portion was held by Rotbert, and of him by Osulf. There were three plough lands, four villeins, two cottars, and a church. It was valued at 30s. Nutbourne manor, connected with it, extends into Pulborough. Estates in the parish descended to the Baroness de la Zouche, Lord Selsey, and the Goring family. The church (Our Lady) is very ancient, retaining a Norman arcade and doorcase of simple architecture. The south aisle and chancel are of the date of Edward I., and the west end was built in the last century. There are memorials to the names of Johnson and Carre, rectors. There are four bells, one of which bears the inscription in Old English characters, and in Latin, \" John, dear to Christ.\" [S. A. C. Sepulchral Barrows at, ix, 116. Church of xii, 89, 90.

By the new Boundaries Act this parish is included in the Borough of Midhurst. Chid-hurst may possibly mean the wood of Cead or Chad, a Saxon proprietor. This is a more probable derivation than that from Cita or Cyte, the wood frequented by kites, a bird which I am informed is unknown there. Before the Conquest, Almar, a free tenant, held the manor of Earl Godwin. It possessed a church, three ministri, and a mill. At the begin ning of the reign of Elizabeth, Peter Bettesworth, a younger son of Bettesworth of Fyning in Bogate, was lord, and his successors long resided here. The church sometimes called \" Capella de Chithurst \" in Iping, the dedication of which is unknown (though it may be presumed to be Our Lady, as a light to her honour existed in the building), is a very small edifice of nave and chancel, but without tower or spire. The nave is partly Decorated. The chancel arch is rude, and the imposts are high for the size. On the north side of it is a hagioscope. The chancel has a Norman window on the north side, and a lancet on the south. There are a piscina and a cre dence table. In the churchyard are a large tombstone with an embossed cross of singular pattern, and four smaller ones, apparently for children, also having crosses.* The manor-house, close to the church, has remains of considerable antiquity, and a fine Sussex chimney. Partly in this parish, and partly in Iping, is a lake covering many acres, and surrounded by trees, forming in the ensemble a beautiful spot. It is doubtless arti ficial, and is known by the undignified name of the Hammer pond, indicating the site of iron-works, which were formerly carried on here. In 1835 the manor belonged to S. F. Piggott, Esq., and it is now the property of Capt. Henry King, R.N., who in 1862 erected Chithurst House, an elegant mansion on a rising ground above the picturesque valley of the Rother. [S. A. C.

Date of earliest Parish Register, 1685. Acreage, 1,794. Chief Land- owner, The Duke of Norfolk. Clapham, in Surrey, received its designation from a Saxon named Clappa, who held the manor in the reign of the Confessor, and our two Sussex Claphams \u2014 this in West Sussex, and the other in Litlington \u2014 probably had owners bearing the same name. Before the Conquest, Alwin held this manor of King Edward ; afterwards Gilbert was tenant of William de Braose. From the reign of Henry III. till that of Henry IV. the family of De St. Owen were possessors, and in the early part of the fif teenth century it fell into the hands of the owners of Michel grove, and has ever since followed the descent of that estate. On the west side of Clapham, in the centre of an estate which includes nearly the whole of this parish and Patching, with part of Angmering, stood Michelgrove House, which was for more than five hundred years one of the principal seats in the county, In the reign of Henry III. it belonged to the family of Le Fauconer, who were descended in the female line from the De Wistonestons of Wiston. From about the year 1314, the Le Fauconers adopted the name of the estate, and wrote themselves De Michelgrove. With them it continued until Elizabeth, sole daughter and heiress, married John Shelley, Esq., who died in 1526. From this pair proceeded the Shelleys of Michelgrove, afterwards Baronets ; the Shelleys of Castle Goring, also Baronets ; the Shelley-Sidneys of Penshurst (now Lord De ITsle) and the Shelleys of Patcham and Lewes. The late representative of this widely- spread and well-allied Sussex family was Sir John Vdliers Shelley, Bart., of Maresfield Park, M.P. for Westminster. His father, the late Sir John Shelley, M.P. for Lewes, after a possession dating back 350 years, in 1800, sold the estate to Richard Walker, Esq., whose son again sold it in 1828 to Bernard-Edward, Duke of Norfolk. That' nobleman, to the grief of the district, pulled down the time honoured mansion of Michelgrove, which had been built on the ancient foundations by Judge Shelley, and honoured by the presence of royalty in the person of King Henry VIII. It was a semi-castellated house of large proportions, situated in a finely wooded park. Sic transit, fe. The family of Shelley produced many eminent members, including Sir John Shelley, who, as a"], [161, "115 CLAYTON. Knight of Rhodes, was slain in the defence of that island against the Turks ; the celebrated Judge William Shelley, temp. Henry VIII. ; Sir Richard Shelley, grand prior of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and Turcopolier ; Sir Edward Shelley, who fell at Pinkie Field by the hand of the Scots ; and last, but not least, one of England's greatest poets, Percy Bysshe Shelley. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" pp. 128-131.) Concerning the farm called Holt, Cartwright mentions some interesting particulars. The church, a very short one, consists of chancel, nave, aisles, and tower. The last had, at the end of the last century, a shingled spire. The building has been much patched and altered, but it retains Transition-Norman features, verging into Early English. In the chancel is a noble brass for g(oi)tt 5tflh2 and (Sltjafoctl) his wife, the heiress of Michelgrove {temp. Henry VIII). The figures are in the costume of the period, with respectively the armorial tabard and robe, displaying the arms of Shelley and Michelgrove, four shields of their arms, and a curious representation of the Trinity. On the north wall is a monument in stone to Judge Shelley, his wife, and their four teen children. Another monument, a mural brass, records John Shelley, Esq., 1550, his wife, and thirteen children, with several shields of -arms. There are other interesting inscriptions in brass and stone for the Michelgroves and Shelleys, and for the ancient family of Parsons. For mortuary memorials this is altogether one of the most interesting churches in Sussex. The three ancient bells in the tower are inscribed to Jacobus, Caterina, and Katerina with Margarita, (sic.)

Azor held this manor of the Confessor, and after the Con quest the wife of William de Wateville held it of William de Warenne. A church is mentioned in Domesday, together with arable, meadow, and woodland, and nine houses in Lewes, as appurtenant to the manor. From John, Earl of Warenne, 21 Edward III., it passed jure uxoris, to Edmund, Earl of Arundel, and descended to the Dukes of Norfolk. In 27th Elizabeth Thomas and George Luxford were lords, after whom the Brownes, Viscounts Montague, possessed it. Their representative, W. S. Poyntz, Esq., sold it in 1825 to the late W. J. Campion, Esq., of Danny, who also purchased the Domesday manor of Wick ham, in this parish. Hammond's Place, near St. John's Com mon, was built by Edward Michelborne in 1566, and was after wards the residence of his son, Sir Edward Michelborne, the adven turous knight, who under the pretext of \" discovering\" countries in the eastern seas, was really little better than a legalized pirate. (\"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 302.) After passing through several hands, this noble house was dismantled, and the family pictures sold. Robert Podmore, Esq. built upon the estate the mansion called Clayton Priory, which afterwards became the property of the late Col. C. W. Elwood, of gallant memory in our Indian wars, whose relict, the accomplished authoress of the \" Over land Journey to India,\" the \"Literary Ladies of England,\" &c, is now possessor. Several relics of the Roman period have been found in this parish, and a paved Roman road traversed St. John's Common. In the early part of the present century remains of a Roman bath were disclosed in the parsonage grounds, but they were again covered up. On June 22, 1305, Edward I., in one of his journeys, spent a night at Clayton. The church, which presents a small and unpromising exterior, consists of a nave, chancel, north porch, and shingled bell-turret at the west end, with three bells, one of which is inscribed to St. Thomas.

Climping was held before the Conquest by Earl Godwin ; afterwards by Earl Roger, who conferred it on the nunnery of Almanesches in Normandy. It was immediately dependent upon the small nun- nery of Lyminster, which had been constituted a cell of the foreign convent. The manor of Atherington was given to the abbey of Seez in Normandy, which had been founded by Roger de Montgomeri in 1050, and a monk or two, established here, formed a kind of cell to Seez, Atherington is now a small ham- let, on the sea shore. The ancient chapel of Atherington still exists; it is locally in the parish of Littlehampton, at Bailifi's Court. A late owner made a dormitory of it for his servants, in order to make them parishioners of Littlehampton ! On the sup- pression of the alien priories by Henry V., this property was given to his nunnery of Sion in Middlesex.

It is cruciform, with a south aisle and porch, and a square tower at the extremity of the south transept. The tower is Norman, and is, as Mr. Hussey thinks, the remains of a former church in that style. The other portions of the building are Early English, and may perhaps be attributed to John deClym ping, who became Bishop of Chiehester in 1253. It is un questionably among the most interesting churches in the county. The north transept belongs to the bailiffry of Atherington. A plate in Horsfield's Sussex gives a good idea of this remarkable building. (Vol. ii. page 113.) The church is undergoing restora tion and repair under the skilful hands of Gordon M. Hills, Esq.

In 1375 it belonged to the Earl of Arundel, who had a park here, but it was aliened, temp. Elizabeth, to Anthony, Viscount Montague. It has since formed part of the Cowdray estate. The church, which consists of a nave, chancel, and south aisle, is Early English, with later insertions. There are three bells, one of which is inscribed to St. Catrina, and another to St. John. In 1305, King Edward I., on one of his journeys, passed two days at Cocking. The abbey of Seez in Normandy had a small cell here until the suppression of the alien priories, when it was transferred to the College of Arundel. A curious phenomenon is observable in this neighbourhood. From the leafy recesses of the hangers of beech on the escarp ment of the Downs, there rises in unsettled weather a mist which rolls among the trees like the smoke out of a chimney. This exhalation is called \" Foxes-brewings,\" whatever that may mean, and if it tends westward towards Cocking rain follows speedily. Hence the local proverb: \u2014 \" When Foxes-brewings go to Cocking, Foxes-brewings come back dropping.' [S. A. C. Domesday watermill, v, 270. King Edward at, ii, 155.

Pre viously Brismar had held-it of Azor. It was assessed at H hide, and there were a villein and three serfs, a saltpan, a meadow, and a wood. In 1262, Thomas de Brom settled on Walter de la Hyde, and Joan his wife, the manors of Cokeham and Stan ham for 40 marks of silver, and a rent of a pair of white gloves, with a penny at Easter. The property afterwards passed to the families of Le Weel and Paynell, and then to the baronial house of Camoys. In 1387 the manor of Cokeham, with the right of ferry over the river at Old Shoreham, was given by Sir William Paynell to the monks of Hardham, to maintain four secular priests. After the dissolution, this estate passed to the families of Goring and Winton. A chapel and hospital, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. Anthony, formerly existed in this hamlet, but the buildings have long been destroyed. It appears"], [166, "120 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. to have been founded towards the end of the reign of Henry III. In 25th Edward III., according to Tanner, a license was granted to the priory of St. John of Jerusalem to hold to its own proper uses the manor of Cokeham, and in that establishment it vested until the dissolution, when the estate passed to the great family of Caryll, and from them by alienation successively to Sturgeon and Barker. During the possession of Cokeham by the Templars, that body was much persecuted by the family of Bernhus, who claimed a right to the lands. Full particulars of these trans actions will be found in S. A. C, Vol. ix, p. 259. COLDWALTHAM. A parish in the Hundred of Bury ; Bape of Arundel ; distant b\\ miles south-east from Petworth, which is its Post-town.

Acreage, 1,193. So called from its bleak situation, to distinguish it from Up Waltham in the Rape of Chiehester. Both are mentioned in Domesday. Coldwaltham, with its ancient park, was an appendage to the see of Chiehester, and it has usually been demised as Amberley. Watersfield is a small hamlet of this parish. In 1316 Bishop Langton obtained for it a market and fair, which shows it to have been then a place of some importance. The line of the Roman road from Bignor to Pulborough passed through this hamlet ; and in 1815 a vessel of coarse pottery, containing 1700 third-brass coins of Gallienus and his immediate successors was found here. The church has a nave, chancel, and a massive tower at the west end. The dedication is unknown. [S. A. C. Land enclosed by the Bishop, iii, 45. Roman road and coins, xi, 137. Bells, xvi, 206.

Walter Onions Purton, M.A. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1538. Acreage, 1,292. The whole parish is the pro perty of Lord Leconfield, and is occupied by Messrs. John and William Hampton. The village is situated in a deep recess or Combe of the Downs. Part of the parish is lowland, bounded by the Adur, where salt-pans formerly existed; the rest is principally down. Applesham, the residence of the tenants, is one mile south ofthe church. Before the Conquest, Guest held this manor of the Confessor, and afterwards William Fitz-Norman held Cumbe and Apelsham of Earl William de Braose. The population of these two manors must have been greater in the 11th century than at present, for Domesday enumerates 48 male inhabitants, whereas the entire population is now but 70 or 80. The Fitz- Norman family adopted the local surname of De Combe, and continued in possession until the reign of Henry IV., when Matilda de Combe, the heiress, wife of Sir John Halsham, car ried it to his family. The Lewknors obtained it by marriage, and in the reign of Henry VIII. it was the property of the Shelleys, whose representative sold it in 1785 to the late Earl of Egremont. The church, which was reduced in size in 1724, is a very plain structure, with nave and chancel of equal height, and pigeon house belfry at the west end. The walls are probably Norman, but there are insertions in the Early English and Perpendicular styles. The church and churchyard have memorials for the families of Ingram, Manning, Greenfield, Wyatt, Bridger, Lid better, Penfold, Gell, Carter, &c. Sir William Burred mentions loose brasses of a man and woman in the attitude of prayer, as lying in a window when he visited the church. [S. A. C. Domesday watermill, v, 269. Bell, xvi, 206.

The manor-house in which the Peckhams resided for several generations was rebuilt by Thomas Peckham Phipps, Esq. It is situated in a well wooded vale. The church (St. Mary) is partly Early English and partly Decorated in style, and contains some memorials of the families of Peckham and Phipps.

COPTHOENE, A large waste or common, but now mostly brought under cultivation, lies partly in the parish of Worth, but chiefly over the borders of Sussex, near Burstow, in the county of Surrey. It was formerly the resort of smugglers and other criminals. The inhabitants were of lawless character, and were sometimes the cause of alarm in the district. A horn was therefore kept called the \"Copthorne Horn,\" for the purpose of summoning the aid of the honest neighbours to quell any outbreak. Thanks however to advancing civilization, this horn has long been disused. When Napoleon I. threatened to invade England, Copthorne was fixed upon as a place of refuge for the gentry and others resident in the rapes of Lewes and Pevensey, as soon as the descent of the French should have taken place on our southern shores.

This wealden parish lies to the south of St. Leonard's Forest, and consists chiefly of small farms, held of the manors of Stretham and Ewhurst. Greatwicb, or Gratwicke, gave name to an ancient and widely spread family, who also owned and resided at Gervaise. The heiress of the elder line of Gratwicke conveyed it by marriage to Richard Madgwick, Esq., whose daughter and heiress married Thomas Steele, Esq., whose son, the Right Hon. Thomas Steele, sold it to N. Tredcroft, Esq., and the latter transferred it to James White, Esq., who built the present mansion. Wallhurst belonged, in the early part of the 18th century, to the Lintotts. In 1723 Thomas Lintott, of Wallhurst, obtained a grant of arms. He afterwards removed to Oakenden, another house in this parish, and his son acquired Bolney Place by marriage with the heiress of Dennett. The vicar has a suitable manse and glebe. At Parknowle, W. Percival Boxall, Esq., who is maternally descended from the Peirces and Gratwickes, has erected a mansion of Jacobean architecture, on a spot commanding a very large and varied prospect. Mr. Boxall has a fine collection of pictures. The church (St. Peter) consists of a nave, south aisle, chancel, and west tower, chiefly of the 1 5th century, though the chancel is Early English. The aisle, which is divided from the nave by four- pointed arches, was built temp. Henry VIII., as appears from the will of Roger Agate, 1530, who bequeathed \u00a36 13s. 4d. towards it ; but tradition assigns the chief share of the work to the Gratwickes. There are memorials to the faimlies of Peirce, Healde, Gratwicke, Madgwick, and Tyrwhitt, and in the church yard for Vincent, \"&c. The great arch\u00e6ological attraction of this church is the magnificent brass of \u0152fjOinas i&rlontl, Prior of Lewes, who died in 1433.

A pleasant town-village in the forest district. Before the Brighton railway was made, it was well known in the annals of coaching. As a parish it is one of the smallest in the district ; as a village it has about 1,050 inhabitants, but the houses on the west side of the main street are in the parish of Ifield. It has a very ancient elm tree, completely hollow, and capacious enough to hold a considerable number of persons. Another remarkable tree formerly stood about a mile to the north, at the junction of Sussex and Surrey, and was thence called \" County Oak.\" The manor belonged to the Lords Poynings from 4th King John till the 15th century, when it passed to the Percys. It subsequently belonged to the families of Shirley, Covert, and Morton, and then by purchase to Leonard Gale, Esq., whose coheiresses married Humphrey, Blunt, and Clitherow. In 1861 it belonged to Colonel Clitherow. Crawley exhibits, for so small a place, no inconsiderable amount of public spirit, as witness its attractive Exhibitions of 1865 and 1868. This characteristic is mainly due to the presence here of the late Mr. Mark Lemon, who made it his country retreat, and died here in 1870. John Leech, the l&te well-known artist in Punch, passed his earlier manhood at Crawley. The church, which is in the Decorated style, is dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and consists of a nave, chancel, and a well proportioned tower. It was formerly a chapel to Slaugham. There is a brass plate to SHillltt. UldSt, 1438. Among other features of interest is a beam carved with an Old English in scription : \" Man yn well bewar, for warldly good makyth man blynde. Bewar befor what cumyth behynde.\" There is a tradition of an ancient religious house in this parish. \u2014 Blunt, Esq., erected, in 1861, a semi-conventual establishment, with a chapel, schools, &c, called St. Francis."], [171, "125 CROWBOROUGH.

Vulgo CrowioV, a considerable district on the Forest Ridge, in the parish of Rotherfield, with a barren soil, but with grand and picturesque scenery, this being amongst the most elevated places in the Weald of Sussex, and of the Hastings sand for mation. Probably no spot within the county was, a century or two ago, in so uncivilized a condition as this was ; but in the earlier part of the 18th century, 1732, Sir Henry Fermor, who had been created a baronet in 1725, and who died in 1734, founded here a chapel,* dependent upon Rotherfield, together with a school, bequeathing \u00a33,000 to be applied to the teaching of thirty poor children of Rotherfield, and ten of the neigh bouring parish of Buxted. This charity is stdl sustained, and with the religious ministrations of the chapel and the efficient teaching of the school, it has rescued this wild district from heathendom to a more Christian condition of things. The pre sent incumbent of the chapel is the Rev. J. Jervis William Turner, M.A. Sir Henry Fermor was descended from an ancient family in Picardy, temp. Edward III., and his ancestors long resided at Walshes in Rotherfield. By his patent of baronetcy his title devolved on his kinsman, Sir Charles Evers field, of Denne Park in Horsham, but became extinct on the death of that gentleman, in 1 784. The views from Crowborough can scarcely be equalled in East Sussex. Crowborough Warren was formerly a favourite resort for smugglers from the coast, and for wild and legendary interest it cannot be excelled in this part of England. CROWHURST.

Crowhurst signifies \" the wood of crows.\" At the date of Domesday it was held by Walter FitzLambert of the Earl of Eu, and is described as having been devastated, doubtless by the Norman invasion. There is some confusion as to the early history of the manor. Forming part of the Honour of Hastings, it probably descended with that Rape from the Earl of Eu, the Norman grantee, though it has been asserted that the Con queror granted it to Alan Fergant, Earl of Brittany and Rich mond. The details, which are somewhat long and tedious, are given by Mr. W. S. Walford in the seventh volume of the \" Sussex Collections.\" In 29th Henry 111., when William, Earl of Eu, attached himself to the interests of France, the King took possession, and granted Crowhurst to Peter de Sabaudia, his relative. After several changes, Henry IV. gave the manor to his faithful adherent, Sir John Pelham. With that ancient family it remained, with some interruptions, down to the death of the representative of a junior branch, the late John Cresset Pelham, Esq., whose kinsmen, the Papillous, are now in pos session. On the south side of the church is one of the most interesting examples of domestic architecture in Sussex. It is of the date of about 1250, and though in ruins presents some beautiful details of the architecture of the period., Of the original builder nothing is known, but in 1358 and 1360 this small manor house was undergoing repairs at the cost of John, Earl of Richmond. Crowhurst Park, the ancestral abode for some generations of the Pelhams, is charmingly situated. The house, which is built of stone, stands among undulating and well-wooded scenery, with a commanding view of the sea. The church (St. George) consists of a chancel, nave (rebuilt in 1794), and a west tower embattled, and supported by immense buttresses. Into the head of the tracery of the western window, and at the termination of the hood mouldings of the door-case, are introduced \"Pelham buckles,\" showing that this tower, like many others in East Sussex, owes its origin to the piety of that distinguished family. The church and churchyard contain memorials for the families of Dyson, Marten, Breton, Waters, Brett, &c.

The land is much diversified with arable, pasture, and wood, and the scenery is excellent. The town stands on high ground and is very healthy. On the side adjoining Hurst-Pierpoint is Leigh Pond, which measures nearly 50 acres, and is well stocked with fish, and a favourite resort, in hard weather, for wildfowl. The manor extends into the neighbouring parishes of Worth, Bolney, and Clayton. It has passed through the same line as the barony of Lewes, and the manor was lately the possession of the families of Neville and Sergison. Leigh is another ancient manor in the parish. Payne's Place was a considerable mansion, deriving its name from the family. The Husseys were proprietors in the reign of Elizabeth. Board, or Boord Hill belonged to the family of that name. Cuckfield Place is an ancient house, which formerly belonged to the Bowyers and Hendleys, and was purchased, nearly two centuries since, by Charles Sergison, Esq., in whose descendants it still vests. There are consider able remains of old oak panelling and pargetting. Other con siderable houses, some of which are diminished in size and im portance, are Butler's Green, Bolnore (which gave name to its aucient proprietors), Holmstead, Pilstye, Tye,_ and Slough House.

The square western tower supports a tall shingled spire, and contains eight bells. The architecture ranges from Early English to Perpendicular. There is much modern painted glass, and there are several interesting memorials, especially a brass plate to Gerard Burred, Archdeacon of Chiehester and Vicar of Cuckfield, 1508. He was son of Sir John Burrell, of Devonshire, who was in the campaign of Edward V. against the French, and furnished forth a ship with 20 men at arms and 40 archers. He was a collateral ancestor of the much-respected family of Burrell, now widely known in Sussex. There are two brasses of no ancient date, and among other mortuary memo rials are included the names of Burrell, Goring, Culpeper, Ser gison, Bowyer, Vaux, Wyte, Michell, &c. There was formerly a chantry chapel in the church-yard. A grammar-school was founded here in 13th Henry VIII., by Elmund Flower of London, merchant-taylor. The families of Porter and Hever were among the former landed proprietors in this parish. The following singular statement is copied from the \"Gentle man's Magazine\" of 1807 :\u2014 \" A female servant of Mr. Wood, of Cuckfield, Sussex, in consequence of a slight indisposition, retired to bed on Saturday, the 15th instant, and had continued in uninterrupted sleep till Saturday, the 22nd (having slept eight days) ; she then remarked, on hearing the bells chime for church, that her yesterday's indisposition had caused her to lie beyond her ordinary hour. She got up without much assistance, but complained of excessive thirst and being extremely weak. Mrs. Wood took all possible care of her, and she is now perfectly recovered. During the whole of this suspension of her faculties, the Hush of health appeared on her cheeks ; but their fulness diminished considerably after the third day, when her pulsation grew weaker and her breathing could hardly be perceived.

The manor, which is very extensive, was held before the Conquest by a proprietor called Norman. Henry I., after having taken Bayeux in Normandy, inarched against Caen, which surrendered on his approach. As a reward for submission, the King gave to four of the chief burgesses of that town the manor of Dallington, worth \u00a380 per annum. On account of this compromise, Caen was called the \" town of trai tors \" (Villa Traditorum). Orderic. Vital. At later periods Dallington belonged successively to tbe families of St. Leger, Iloo, and Pelham. From the last it was purchased by the family of Ashburnham, who also possess the manor of Hazelden, formerly appurtenant to Hastings Priory. An ancient house here, called the Castle, belongs to . . . Watts, Esq. The church, dedicated to St. Margaret (not St. Giles, as has been asserted), occupies a pleasing site. It consists of a nave, chancel, north transept, and a western tower, with a stone spire. The tower, which contains five well-toned bells, was probably built by the Pelhams, as their \" Buckle \" and arms are carved upon its battlements. The font is worthy of notice.

The scenery is picturesque, and that portion of the parish which is Down (2,000 acres) is noticeable for its luxuriant beech groves. The manor does not occur in Domesday, but at an early date it belonged to William De Albini, Earl of Arundel, as portion of the Honour of Arundel. In 1589 John, Lord Lumley, aliened it to Sir Peter Garton. Sir Matthew Featherstonehaugh pur-"], [177, "131 EAST DEAN. chased the manorial property in 1752, and sold it to the 3rd Duke of Richmond, in whose noble descendant it now vests. The church (dedication unknown) is a small Early English structure of cruciform arrangement. There are three bells, one inscribed, + hal maei, fvl of geas. There was formerly in this parish a hunting-tower within an enclosure or park, but no traces of it remain. Dallaway thinks this may have been the Dean where King Alfred received his friend and instructor Asserius Menevensis ; but that event more probably occurred at Westdean in East Sussex. [S. A. C.

In the Episcopal Registers the former are oddly discriminated as \" Eastdean orientalis,\" and \" Eastdean occidentalis.\" The present note relates to the orien tal East Dean. As its name implies, it is situated in one of the denes or vales of the South Downs. It is mentioned in Domesday as having been held in Saxon times by Edwin, of King Edward, and after the Conquest by Osbern, of the Earl. In 23rd Edward I. it belonged to William de Echingham, and it has subsequently followed the same descent as Friston. The village stands at the head of a beautiful vale, which, prettily wooded in parts, leads down to the well-known opening in the cliff called Birling Gap, formerly dangerous as a vulner able point for invaders, and therefore defended with a gateway and portcullis. In later times it was a convenient landing-place for smugglers. It receives its name from the adjacent manor place, now the farm-house of Birling, which possesses ancient vestiges, particularly a barn with remains of a medieval hall of great size. The manor belonged in the 13th and 14th centuries to the great family of Bardolf. (Lib. de Antiq. Leg. cci.) To the eastward of the Gap the cliffs rise with bold undulations to k 2"], [178, "132 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Beachy-head. Between the two points, at a place called Belle tout, the site of an ancient entrenchment, stands what is called Beachy Head Lighthouse \u2014 the efficiency of which in preventing shipwrecks has been proved by the experience of more than 40 years. Birling Gap is the junction of the submarine and inland telegraph from Paris to London, vid Dieppe. Ihe church is small, and consists of a nave and chancel, with a tower on the north side of the nave. There are inscriptions for the Dippery and Willard families. Of the three bells, two are ancient ; one is inscribed to St. James, and the tenor has the boastful legend : \u2014 \" Me melior vere, non est campana sub \u00e6re.\" \" Surely no bell beneath the sky, Can send forth better sounds than 1 1\" In the face of the cliff near Belle-tout is an excavation called \" Parson Darby's Hole,\" which was made about the 18th cen tury by the Rev.

He certainly had several other manors in the vicinity. Before the Conquest, it belonged, probably by descent, to Edward the Confessor. Afterwards Ralph, ancestor of the"], [179, "133 WEST DEAN. family of De Dene, held it of the Earl of Moreton. Ela, daugh ter of Ralph de Dene, temp. Henry IL, married Jordan de Sack ville, ancestor of the Dukes of Dorset. The granddaughter of Robert, her brother, married Nicholas Heringaud, Lord of Ick lesham and Dene, in whose descendants it remained for several generations. In the 15th century the family of Bray appear to have been possessors. John Bray senior, \" gentilman, and Wil liam Bray, gentilman,\" were in Cade's rebellion in 1450. The manor-house, which was destroyed about the year 1825, was, in the 17th century, the residence and property of Sir William Thomas, the builder of Folkington Place, from whom it de scended through the Dobells to Launcelot Harison, Esq. The manor now belongs to the Duke of Devonshire. Chaelston was formerly a manor of importance, and still has traces of a chapel (?) with Transition-Norman features. Among its more recent owners have been Wood, Alfrey, Bean, and Scutt. Exceit was anciently a parish. Bishop Sherburne in 1528 incorporated it with West Dean, and at the same time made it a prebend of Chiehester. Traces of the church may be seen on a rising ground near the river Cuckmere. The manor belonged temp. Edward I. to the De Echinghams, and at a later date to the Wests. It has long been owned by the Gages. Westdean Church consists of a single pace, without any dis tinction of chancel, and a western tower with a rather singular roof, by way of spire. In the north wall are two monumental canopied arches of different dates, and in the south a large piscina. There a,re Norman, Early English, and later features, and remains of the rood-loft stairs. A large monument comme morates William Thomas, Esq., and his family, 1639. There are other memorials to the names of Tirrey, Harison, and in the churchyard for Alfrey, and Stanford. The parsonage house adjacent to the church, now occupied as a cottage, is a very interesting little medieval structure. Mr. Hussey considers it to belong to the Decorated period, but Parker assigns it to the 1 3th century. It has a newel staircase of stone.

This parish is agreeably diversified with arable, pasture, woodland, and down. The small river Lavant passes through it. The manor of Westdean, sometimes known as Earl's Court, does not appear in Domesday, but is supposed to have been in cluded in Singleton, there called Silletone. It passed to Roger de Montgomeri, Earl of Arundel and Chiehester, and continued in that succession till the reign of Elizabeth. John Lord Lumley sold it in 1589 to John Lewknor, Esq., whose descen dant, John Lewknor, Esq., in 1 706 bequeathed it to his distant rela tive Elizabeth Woodward-Knight, whose second husband was Bul strode Peachey, Esq., ancestor of the Barons Selsey, whose descendant, the Honourable Mrs. Vernon Harcourt, is now pos sessor. Another manor called Westdean-Canons, was given by John Fitzalan to the canons of Chiehester, for the founda tion of two chantries there. Preston, a third manor, mentioned in Domesday, has descended as Westdean. Westdean Warren and Chilgrove also formed part of the possessions of the Peacheys. The ancient manor-house of Westdean was built, temp. James I., by the Lewknors. The present house, built by Lord Selsey early in the present century, is a spacious structure of squared flints, in the \" Strawberry-hill \" style of Gothic. It stands in an ex tensive and well- wooded park. The church (St. Andrew) consists of nave, chancel, transepts, and west tower, and is of Early English date. There are several fine monuments for the Lewknor and Peachey families, including one for three of the Lewknors (avam, filium, nepotem), 1616, 1602, &c. The memorials of the Peacheys are well deserv ing of attention. There are three bells, one of which is curiously dated 1901. Several antiquities have been exhumed in the parish. [S. A. C.

Acreage, 1,008. Nearly the whole of the land in the parish belongs to Miss Caroline Catt. The parish is partly on the Downs and partly on the marshy borders of the Ouse. The village lies in a sequestered valley, whence its name, dene-tun, \"the enclosure in a vale.\" Part of the j>opulation is adjacent to the town of Newhaven. The manor belonged in 1052 to Earl Godwin. In ,9th Henry VI., John Hidenye was lord, and subsequently it has vested in Shelley, Michell, Joliffe, Fisher, Bates, and Catt. The church (St. Leonard) consists of a single pace or nave, with no interior distinction of chancel. The west end has a small bell-turret of wood and tile, and comes out with picturesque effect from its background of trees. In the recent repairs, made at the expense of the family of Catt, the building has been restored as nearly as possible to its original condition. The prevailing style is Early English, but with many additions of the 14th century. In the south wall near the east end of the chancel is a broad sedile under an ogee arch, and near it an excellent piscina. More westward, near where the chancel arch should be, is a buttress-like projection, which was found to contain the rood loft staircase. The font, which is possibly ante-Norman, is of the barrel shape and basket pattern, like that of St. Anne's, Lewes.

It is said to have originally contained 1,000 acres.* As it was within the rape of Pevensey, it was accounted parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster. The bailiffs Of the rape claimed juris diction, and many suits were commenced in the Duchy court, particulars of which are given in the \" Sussex Collections,\" Vol. xiv. At length the royal claims were withdrawn, and the respective lords and customary tenants held possession. In 1813 the portion within the manor of Laughton was enclosed under an act of Parliament, and the whole is now employed in profitable agriculture. At the Upper Dicker a district church was erected about 1840, and Dr. Vidal, afterwards Bishop of Sierra Leone, was first appointed to the charge.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1551. Acre age, 4,183. Chief Landowners, Representatives of the late William Tanner, Esq., the Earl of Abergavenny, and the Representatives of the late Captain Richardson. This ancient Wealden parish is about five miles in length, by 1^ in breadth, and exhibits considerable variety of surface, some parts being pretty level, while the eminence called Ditch ling Beacon, on the escarpment of the South Downs, reaches the height of 858 feet above the level of the sea. It is the highest elevation in Sussex. From this height the Isle of Wight and the Surrey hills are to be seen in clear weather. Consider able remains of a Roman camp exist near the Beacon. The town is cruciform in arrangement, and contains some ancient houses of picturesque character. King Alfred the Great is said to have held an extensive range of land in this parish, and this is probable, since that monarch left by his will to Osferth, his kinsman, Ditchling, then called Deccalingum. Mr. Hutchinson thinks that there was a royal park here, and that the name of the parish is derived from this circumstance. The Anglo-Saxon Dykening signifies any enclo sure, whether secured by earthworks, walls, paling, or ditches, and Dycheninge is one of the old forms of spelling what is now Ditchling. Edward IL, when Prince of Wales, kept a stud of horses here, doubtless in the ancient royal park. Some years since there were discovered at the western extremity of the parish, the foundations of a mansion \u2014 perhaps the residence to which the royal park was attached. Some paving tiles, appa rently of the time of Henry VIII., and of a unique pattern, were found, but no other indicia of the date of the building. The tiles are in the possession of the Rev. Edward Turner, rector of Maresfield. Ditchling belonged before the Conquest to Edward the Confessor, and William the Conqueror gave it with innumerable other manors to William de Warenne, the husband of his daughter Gundrada. De Warenne granted free pasturage for cattle to the Priory of Lewes. The manor des cended like the barony of Lewes, and the Nevilles, Earls of Abergavenny, still hold it, after the lapse of eight centuries, in virtue of their descent through several noble lines from the Conqueror. There are four minor manors ; Dymocks (or Ditch ling Rectory), Ditchling Garden, Camois-court, and Pelling worth, but some of these extend beyond the boundaries of the parish. Tho advowson of the church was conferred by AVilliam, second Earl of Warenne on Lewes Priory, and so remained"], [184, "138 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. until the dissolution of that establishment, when Henry VIII. granted it to Anne of Cleves, his divorced wife. Wivelsfield, now a separate parish, was anciently a chapelry of Ditchling. From an undated deed, but probably of the time of Edward I. or II. , it appears that the parish gave name to a family, Alex ander de Ditchling being one of the witnesses. The geological formation of this district is of considerable interest, and includes chalk, red sand, and gault, besides occa sional deposits of Sussex marble. There was formerly a chaly beate spring on Ditchling common, which was resorted to for its medicinal virtues. Near it was discovered, some years since, a brass celt, together with several masses of molten copper of considerable weight, suggesting the probability of there having been a manufactory of those implements near the spot. In 1734 a remarkable tragedy occurred in this parish. Jacob Harris, a Jew piedlar, committed a very barbarous murder at its northern extre mity. The Jew having put up his horse at the public house hard by, attacked his host, named Miles, and cut his throat. In the same way he destroyed a maid servant, and then went up stairs and cut the throat of Mrs. Miles, then lying sick. The murderer, however, was identified, and executed at Horsham. After this he was hung in chains close to the scene of the murders, and a part of the gibbet still remains, and is called \" Jacob's Post.\" In the days of our fathers a fragment of this post was considered a sovereign remedy for tooth-ache ! The church (supposed to be St. Margaret) stands upon an elevation, and is a conspicuous object from all points of view. It is cruciform in plan, and its date is the 13th century. It is generally considered a fine specimen of the Early English style, being just in its proportions, and beautiful in its details. The chancel is well worth inspection. It has a sedile and piscina, together with several niches of ornamental character. The original pidars and shafts are of chalk, a material now too much neglected in our church architecture. There are many interesting monumental inscriptions, including several to the family of Turner, of Oldland in Keymer, who acquired that estate in 34 Henry VIII. In 1637 Thomas Turner purchased the impropriate tythes of Ditchling, and his descendants acquired right of sepulture in the chancel, and were there buried for some generations, extending from 1671 to. 1786. There are other memorials to the families and names of Hougham, Cul peper, Hause, Poole, &c. Henry Poole, Esq., who died in 1580, was buried in the north chancel, which is said to have been built by the Ranger of the park. It is attached to an old house in the town; while the south or Abergavenny chancel has long been attached to the principal manor. The tower is crowned by a low spire, and contains five bells of the 18th century. Many"], [185, "139 DONNINGTON. interesting- details respecting this fine old church are given by the Rev. Thomas Hutchinson, vicar, in his article on Ditch ling in \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" and also in Hussey's Churches (p. 222). Besides the church there seems to have been a chapel in Ditchling about the year 1200, which Mr. Hussey thinks rhay have been what is now the church of Street, a neighbouring parish \u2014 but see Wivelsfield. Among ancient families connected with this place, may be mentioned those of Michelborne, De la Chambre, and Chat field, aU armigerous. The last-named family, I think, took their surname from an estate somewhere in the neighbouring parish of Westmeston. [S. A. C. Extracts from Parish Registers, iv, 284. Domesday water mill, v, 270.

The situation chosen was, as Mr. Blaauw, its historian, in Vol. viii. of"], [187, "141 DUREFORD ABBEY. the \" Sussex Collections,\" observes, an agreeable one on a sunny elevation, gradually sloping southward to the left bank of a small stream, an affluent of the Arun (that is of the western Rother). Traces of the gardens and fishponds, with a few carved stones, alone remain to mark the exact spot.* The great family of De Hosatus or Hussey were Lords of Harting, where they continued for many generations, and several of them became benefactors to the Abbey. This establishment was dependent on the Abbey of Welbeck, in co. Nottingham, and was dedi cated to St. John the Baptist. The benefactions of lands made by noble and other personages were very considerable, but the only church acquired by the brethren was that of St. Bartholo mew of Rogate. The history of the house is contained in its chartulary, a well-preserved M.S., of wliich Mr. Blaauw makes large use in his article. It consists for the most part of acqui sitions of lands by the canons, for the maintenance of additional brethren and chaplains to say masses, &c, as well as in free ahns. A list of the abbots from the Foundation to the Disso lution, nearly complete, is found in this document. King Edw ard II. visited the abbey in 1324 for a day, when his household expenses amounted to \u00a310 6s. Between 1327 and 1337, John de Langton, Bishop of Chiehester, wrote from Aldingburne to Adam, Bishop of Winchester, stating that the monastery had been reduced to extreme poverty owing to robbers invading it as enemies, both by plundering and firing their house and goods, and praying that the advowson of Compton church might be given to them. This does not seem to have been granted, though the canons afterwards became possessors of half the manor of Compton. In 1417, the \"vestibule\" (tower?) ofthe church was struck by lightning, which destroyed it, and the eight bells which it contained. This calamity was, however, remedied in the next year, and bells, doubtless from a Sussex foundry, were re-hung. The tenor weighed 14\u00a3 cwt. In an inventory of the abbey furniture, taken in 1420, is mentioned a \" great text (the gospels) ornamented with a great beryl, and a register of the dead inserted.\" In 1534 the royal commissioners visited the abbey, and found its income worth \u00a3108 13s. 9d. As one of the smaller monasteries, it was soon afterwards dis solved, and the site was granted to Sir William Fitzwilliam. In 1545 it was given to Sir Edward Mervyn. Soon the conven tual church, the chapter-house, and in fact all the principal buildings were ruthlessly destroyed, and, as Mr. Blaauw observes, \"cattle and swine may now roam over the spots where so many generations of pious worshippers knelt before the altars of the Holy Cross, St. Mary, or St. Catherine.\" A few foundations near * Some of these stones are figured in vol. viii, S.

Population in 1811, 186 ; in 1861, 171. Acreage, 891. This small parish is ecclesiastically united with West Tarring. Its church, which from its foundations appears to have measured 75 feet by 21, and consisted of a chancel, nave, and south porch, has long disappeared. From traces of it which existed some years since, Mr. Hussey was led to conclude that it was in the Norman and Early English styles of archi tecture. The manor belonged, soon after the Conquest, to the great family of le Sauvage, and it descended as Broadwater. Another reputed manor belonged to the family of Shelley of Lewes. A moiety of the great tithes of Durrington was given by Robert le Sauvage to Beeding Priory before 1150. It now belongs to Magdalen College, Oxford, and is let under a bene ficial lease to the Rector of Bramber. The other moiety belongs to the Rector of Tarring. Cartwright seems to consider Dur rington as a hamlet of Tarring, but I think there is httle doubt of its parochiality. EARNLEY. A parisb in the Hundred of Manhood ; Bape of Chiehester ; distant 6| miles south-west from that City, which is its Post-town and Bailway station. Union, West Hampnett. Population in 1811, 106; in 1861, 116. Benefice, a Bectory, valued at \u00a3444; Patrons, the Bishop of Chiehester, and the Duke of MNorfolk ; Incumbent, Bev. George Cornwall. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1562. Acreage, 1,157. The name of this fertile little parish has been derived from the Anglo-Saxon, earn and lege, \" the abode of eagles,\" but its flat surface renders this improbable. Almodington, originally a separate parish was in 1526 consolidated with Earnley. Earnley"], [189, "143 EARTHAM gave name in the time of Edward I. to the family of Ernie, who were for several centuries influential in West Sussex. Their manor-house, a large castellated mansion, surrounded by a moat, stood near the church. The most distinguished member of the famdy was Sir John Ernley, Chief Justice of the Com mon Pleas, temp. Henry VIII. A portion of the estate passed to the family of May, afterwards Knight, by whom it was sold to that of Drew. The gentle family of Rishton were long resi dent at Almodington. The church is a small building, in the Early English style, having a nave, chancel, and tower, with a single bell. Bkacklesham, which formerly had a chapel dependent upon Earnley, gives name to Bracklesham Bay, a locality well-known for its fossil remains, described in Dixon's Geology of Sussex. The sea view from this spot is delightful. [S. A. C. Families of Michelgrove and Ernie, xii, 44. Church, xii, 70. Almodington church, and Bracklesham Chapel, ibid. Bell, xvi, 207. xviii, 93.

The manor, formerly part of Slindon, was obtained by the Crown, 33rd Henry VIII., in exchange for the lands of Michel ham Priory. Temp. Elizabeth it was the property of John, Lord Lumley. It was afterwards aliened to Anthony Kempe, and has since passed as Slindon. Thomas Hayley, Esq., of Chiehester, having purchased an estate here of the heirs of Sir Robert Fagg, Bart., built a summer retreat, which his son, the well-known William Hayley, enlarged and improved, makino- it a kind of Tusculum for the reception of literary men, artists &c. Here Romney had a studio, and painted many portraits. In 1800 the amiable but eccentric poet sold it to the Rt. Hon. William Huskisson, who afterwards sat in several parliaments for Chiehester, as another William \" de Eartham\" had done five centuries before.

In March, 1866, in compliance with the will of the widow of the great statesman, Sir J. Ralph Milbanke, Bart, of Eartham House, her great nephew, took the name of Huskisson. For memoirs of Hayley, see \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 258. The church (St. Margaret) is very small, and consists of chancel, nave, and north aisle ; the chancel arch is Norman. Before the Reformation it had altars of Our Lady, St. John, St. Katherine, St. James, and St. Anne \u2014 a remarkable circum stance considering the smallness of the building.

Population in 1811, 720 ; in 1861, 859. Benefice, a Per- petual Curacy, valued at \u00a3106; Patron, tbe Earl of Egmont ; In- cumbent, Bev. Edward Tufnell, M.A., of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1538. Acreage, 4,043. Chief Landowner, the Earl of Egmont. This parish, known in ancient records as Esseburne, con sists of arable, pasture, and heath, especially the latter, growing on the black sand of the district, which also encourages the growth of fir, hazel, and other trees. The village is agreeably placed near the Rother, and contains several very good resi dences. From some neighbouring points pleasing and pictu resque views are attainable. The two principal objects of in terest in the parish are the remains of Cowdeay House and Easebouene Peioet. The hundred of Eseburn is mentioned in Domesday, but no manor, specified by that name, occurs, though the manors of Tolintone and Gretcham are described. Easebourne must have belonged, with the rest ofthe rape, to Earl Roger de Montgomeri. Temp. Richard I. Franco de Bohun held it under the earldom, by knight's service, as parcel of the barony of Midhurst. It has ever since so passed, and now belongs to the Earl of Egmont. A small Benedictine priory of nuns was founded here at an uncertain date, though the founder is ascertained to be John,"], [191, "145 EASEBOURNE. son of Franco de Bohun, lord of Midhurst, who flourished about the middle of the thirteenth century. The establishment was for five or six \" poor nuns\" \u2014 a refuge, as has been conjectured, \" for noble or gentle poverty.\" (Blaauw.) The precise nature of its endowment is unknown, but it seems to have been amply sufficient for the purpose. Among the early benefactors were the families of De Bohun, De Wolbedyng, and others. Never theless, in 1409, King Henry IV. issued a license, the preamble of which sets forth that the convent was so overburthened with debt that it could not sustain the nuns, ten in number, and the two chaplains whom they were bound to provide. By an arrange ment with the Prior and convent of Lewes, the advowsons of Comp ton and Up-Marden were transferred, liable to conditions, to this house. Nevertheless, some years later, in 1441, the sisterhood was in debt, as they alleged to the Bishop of Chiehester, through the extravagance of the Prioress, who frequently rode abroad with an unnecessary retinue, staid away from home duties too long, and was too much given to delicate food- and dress, e. g. the trimmings of her mantle were worth 100 shillings. Moreover, she inflicted too much work on the sisters, she alone taking the profit ; whereupon the Bishop took away the tem poral administration of the Prioress, directed her cherished mantle to be sold, and justice to be done to her subordinates, who were to have half their earnings. However the internal mismanagement of the convent went on, and in 1478 great abuses were brought before episcopal notice, the Lady Agnes Tauke (of the Westhampnett family) then being prioress. Some of the nuns appear to have been \" gadders abroad,\"' for drink ing and other purposes ; and two of them, Joan Portesmouth and Philippa King, had absconded, it is hardly improbable, with Sir John Smyth, chaplain, and N. Style, a servant of the Earl of Arundel, who were wont to have great familiarity within the said priory. William Gosden and John Capron (names still known near Midhurst) are supposed to have harboured the erring devotees in their houses. Worse than all, it was a current scandal that, many years since, the Prioress had given birth to one or two children, and that the said Joan and Philippa had added babes to the population. Alas \u2014 \" Naturam expelles furca, tamen usque recurret!\" Altogether the history of this establishment sheds little lustre on the monastic system. There were continual squabbles between the prioress and her nuns, which were ultimately put an end to by the dissolution of the house in 1535, when the site was granted to Sir William FitzWdliam, Lord of Cowdray. Thenceforth the disused nunnery became a convenient lay L"], [192, "146 HISTORY OF SUSSEX dwelling-house. In 1780 Grimm made drawings of the mo nastic remains for Sir William Burrell, among whose collections in the British Museum they still exist, and exhibit the then remaining portions of the church, cloisters, dormitory, and refectory. Among the original relics of the nunnery are two bells, still in the belfry of Easebourne, one dedicated to St. Anne, and the other inscribed \" Te Deuni laudamus.\" The hamlet of South Ambeeshah, formerly a detached por tion of the parish of Steep in Hampshire, was annexed by the Boundaries Act (7 & 8 Viet.) to the county of Sussex. Eccle siastically it was apportioned between this parish and Farn hurst. In 1861 its population was 143, and its area was re turned at 1,506 acres. Buddington and Hollist are other hamlets of Easebourne. The church (St. Mary, wrongly ascribed by Ecton to St. Mar garet) is the mother church to those of Midhurst, Lodsworth, and Farnhurst. It is not striking for its architecture, which is Perpendicular. The south wall originally formed one side of the cloisters of the Priory. In a recess on the north side of the chancel are the alabaster effigies of Sir David Owen, Knight banneret (mentioned under Midhurst) , a natural son of Owen ap Meredith, ap Tudor, who married Catherine, widow of King Henry V. His will was proved in 1542, but the monument seems to have been erected during his life-time, some years earlier. The will, * and a minute description of the monument, are given in Vol. vii. of the \" Sussex Collections.\" The mor tuary chapel belonging to Cowdray House contains several mo numents, including two large tombs. That on the right is for Sir Anthony Browne, K.G., first Viscount Montague, and his two wives. The ladies are recumbent, but my lord, in armour, kneels before an altar: all is richly coloured and gilt. The adjoining tomb, of black marble, commemorates Anthony, Vis count Montague, 1767, and his wife Barbara, 1779. Against the north wall are two mural monuments ; the first is for Wil liam Stephen Poyntz, Esq., 1840, who had Cowdray in right of his wife, Elizabeth Mary, sister and heiress of George Samuel, Viscount Montague. This gentleman and lady had a painful trial in the loss of their only two sons, William and Courtnay, while on a boating excursion off Bognor, who were drowned in sight of their parents. The companion monument, by Chantrey, to the Hon. Mrs. Poyntz, 1830, is a fine piece of art. There are several other memorials in the church for the families of Rigges of Hollist, in this parish, and others. In the church- * This document is in the possession of Alex. Brown, Esq., late of Easebourne Priory."], [193, "147 EASEBOURNE. yard is a very venerable hoUow and battered yew, more than 25 feet in circumference. Cowdeat House was, a century ago, and is even now, in its venerable ruins, one of the boasts of West Sussex. The name of Coudray is common in Normandy, and signifies a grove or \" hurst\" of hazel trees. This noble but unfortunate mansion has so often been described that I shall confine myself to a very brief sketch. The estate remained with Midhurst to the Bohuns, and a co-heiress conveyed it to Sir David Owen. It afterwards passed (temp. Henry VIII.) to Sir Anthony Browne, K.G., of Battle Abbey, whose son, Sir Anthony, was created Viscount Montague in 1554, and a succession of his descen dants, numbering eight Viscounts, held it until, on failure of a male heir, it passed to Mr. Poyntz as above mentioned. When, in 1528, Sir David Owen sold the estate to Sir William Fitz- William, afterwards Earl of Southampton, the latter obtained a patent from Henry VIII. permitting him to enlarge the park and to rebuild or add an embattled castle of stone to the ancient house of Cowdray. A full history and description of the house and its misfortunes is given in Vol. v. of the Sussex Collec tions, by Sir Sibbald Scott, Bart., F.S.A. ; and, in Vol. vii., the same writer prints a \" Booke of Orders and Rules\" of Anthony, Viscount Montague, in 1595, the MS. of which is preserved at Easebourne Priory. This document shows the almost regal state in which the old Viscounts kept house.* Cowdray House, where all this magnificence was displayed, was destroyed by fire in 1793, and within a few weeks after wards its noble proprietor, George-Samuel, eighth Viscount Montague, was drowned, together with Mr. Sedley Burdett, brother of the late Sir Francis, in attempting to shoot the Falls of Laufenburg on the Rhine, not those of Schaffhausen, as has been frequently stated. The letters directed to his lordship concerning this dire calamity were crossed by others communi cating the news of his rash and fatal act. Cowdray received royal visits, first in 1547 from King Edward VI., who was \" marvelously, yea rather excessively banketed,\" and secondly, in 1591, from Queen Elizabeth, who remained six days. Her reception was most loyal and magnificent. She was met by pageants, and slept that night in a bed of velvet, in a chamber hung with tapestry taken from Raphael's cartoons. There must have been a \"jolly\" larder, for the Sunday's breakfast included three oxen and 140 geese ! Everywhere she went the Queen was met by those who personated pilgrims, nymphs, wild men, &c. She was conducted to a great oak, whereon were hung her * \"Sir,\" said Pr. Johnson, when he visited Cowdray from Brighton, \"I should like to stay here twenty-four hours.

At her departure she knighted six of the gentlemen-in-waiting. \"How changed the scene is now !'' The ivy-mantled ruins of the great quadrangle, with its majestic turreted gateway, surmounted by the arms of Henry VIII., remain, but of the great \" buck-hall,\" 60 feet long, with its eleven bucks carved in oak, in different attitudes, its fine chapel, its banqueting-room, its noble staircase, and the other accompaniments of a right noble abode, few relics exist. Of the wall paintings, supposed to have been executed by Bernardi, the decorator of the south transept of Chiehester Cathedral, some faint traces are seen. The fine pictures, some of which were by Holbein, a visitor here, were swept away in the general conflagration. At the present day this magnificent abode is represented by Cowdray Lodge, a mile distant, the in significant residence of Lord Egmont, and once only the abode of the park-keeper. The park, which consists of 800 acres, is full of heights and hollows thickly carpeted with fern. The timber and avenues are admirable. [S. A. C.

It is a Post-town and has a Bailway station. Population in 1811, 2,623 ; in 1861, 5,795. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at \u00a3700 ; Patron, the Treasurer of Chiehester Cathedral ; Incumbent, Eev.

Mrs. Gilbert ; Southbourne-house, Beginald John Graham, Esq. ; The Greys, Charles Manby, Esq. There are many other considerable residences in the parish. Few places on the southern coast have increased more in population within the present century than Eastbourne. In"], [195, "149 EASTBOURNE. 1821 it numbered only 2,607 inhabitants, in 1861 it had 5,795, and now it probably has nearly 10,000. The causes of this rapid increase are several ; first, the known salubrity of the place; secondly, its picturesque scenery both land and seaward; and thirdly, railway accommodation, which brings it within a two hours' journey of London. Thus, what was a century ago little more than a rude fishing village, has become a very fashionable and important watering-place. The parish, a few years since, contained several detached villages, known as East bourne (the Old Town), Southbourne, Sea-houses, and Meads ; but these, by the introduction of new houses and streets, have been well-nigh brought together, so as to form collectively one large town ; and as the process is still going on, the probability is that even during the present century this division into dis tricts will cease to be recognized, except perhaps as wards. To enumerate the new terraces, streets, parades, hotels, &c, which have sprung up, almost as if by magic, would be foreign to the purpose of this work. Suffice it to say that the sea frontage is scarcely equalled on the south coast of England, while the luxurious growth of trees, particularly elms, gives the town a charm not to be surpassed in such close proximity to the sea on the south-east shores of Britain, which are generally devoid of this auxiliary to the landscape. The swelling downs, culminating westward at Beachy Head, the verdant, lawn-like fields, and plantations, with the other natural beauties of the place, belong rather to the pen of the tourist than to the grave historian of our county annals and antiquities. I therefore confine myself to a brief notice of these matters. Mr. George F. Chambers, F.R.G.S., has, in vol. xiv. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" lightened my labours by an excellent historical account of the parish, from which I borrow somewhat, with due acknowledgment. The etymology of the name is uncertain. It is probably from the stream called the Bourne, wliich rises near the parish church, and flows thence partly un derground to the sea ; but as there is no other place called Bourne in the district, the prefix East is difficult to account for. The very early history of Eastbourne is involved in obscurity. Many Roman remains have been found here, particularly a villa and bath of considerable importance, in 1712, which Dr. Tabor, an eminent physician of Lewes, described in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" vol. xviii. The learned doctor, upon the strength of this discovery, attempts to claim for Eastbourne the honour of having been the Roman station of Anderida ; but this ques tion has been settled of late years by evidence which proves that Pevensey Castle represents that station. The earliest record of Eastbourne is in Domesday book. Borne is there"], [196, "150 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. stated to have been held by the Confessor, and to have been valued at 46 hides. The King, during his journeys, had one night's entertainment. The Conqueror granted it to the Earl of Moreton, and it was valued at \u00a340. A watermill of 5s. per annum is also mentioned. There were eight salt pans, valued at \u00a38 and 40d. In 1324 Edward IL, on his way from Pevensey to Bishopston, paid a flying visit to Bourne. The Prior of Wymondesley, co. Herts, made presents provided from the 400 acres of land possessed by his Priory near Bourne. In the year 1114 King Henry I. was at Burne, where the monarch and some of his nobles and prelates forced Ernulph, Abbot of Peterborough, to accept the Bishopric of Rochester. Ernulph objected, and acted upon the nolo episcopari principle in good earnest ; but the King handed him over to the Archbishop of ' Canterbury with orders to consecrate him \" whether he would or not !\" Henry at this time was waiting for a fair wind to carry him over sea. At a later period the Barons de Badlesmere, of the great family of that name in Kent, held the greater part of the parish with the chief lordship of the Hundred ; and it continued in his family until its extinction on the death of Giles, the last Baron, in 1338,* and when his sister Margery carried it by marriage to William Baron de Roos of Hamlake, whose family were lords, with one interruption, till 1508, when it passed to Eleanor, sister of Edmund the last Baron, who married Sir Robert Manners, and he, jure uxoris, became Baron de Roos. His descendants became successively Earls and Dukes of Rut land. Henry, second Earl of Rutland, and Margaret his wife, in 1554, conveyed the three manors to Jacob Burton, John Selwyn, and Thomas Gildridge, and the chief-lordship between them. Mr. Burton resided at Eastbourne Place, now called Compton Place. William Wilson, Esq., of Fletching, married the granddaughter of Edward Burton, D.D., rector of Broad water, whence the name of the manor of Eastbourne-Burton. William Wilson, Esq., an adherent of Charles IL, was created a baronet in the 13th year of that reign. At the beginning of thB 18th century it was sold by a Wilson to Spencer Compton, second son of James, third Earl of Northampton, many years Speaker to the House of Commons. Mr. Compton was after wards created Earl of Wilmington. The heiress, Lady Elizabeth Compton, married, in 1787, Lord George Henry Cavendish, third son of the fourth Duke of Devonshire, and from him the pro perty descended to the present Duke of Devonshire, who has most liberally promoted the well-being of Eastbourne, and who shares with the Hon. Mrs. Gilbert the principal land interest in * I think the old manor house of the Barons Badlesmere must have stood on the Bourne stream, where traces of a moat are still distinctly visible."], [197, "151 EASTBOURNE. the parish. Mr. Selwyn, who had the second manor, was head of the Friston Place family, and died in 1594. From the Selwyns it passed by marriage and devises to the families of Parker of Ratton, Trayton, Durrant, and Thomas of Vapton, Bart., an ancestor of F. F. Thomas, Esq., of Ratton. Thomas Gildridge, the purchaser of the third manor, lived, it is stated, in a large house at the eastern extremity of Church-street, which was afterwards partitioned into cottages. On the death of Nicholas Gildridge, in 1668, it was carried by a co-heiress to the Eversfields of Steyning, whose eldest daughter, Mary, mar ried Nicholas Gilbert, of Eastbourne, with whose sole heiress, Mary Anne, it passed to Davies Giddy, Esq., who assumed the name of Gilbert, and was well known for his varied attain ments in science and literature, and as holding the office of President of the Royal Society.* There is a small fourth manor, called Eastbourne-Netherin, attached to the rectory. In 1683 it was held by Thomas Alchorne, Esq. A co-heiress married Thomas Worge, E^q. The manor is now held by the Duke of Devonshire and the Hon. Mrs. Gilbert. From the Survey of 1587, when the attack of the Spanish Armada was expected, it appears that the defences of East bourne were not formidable. There were a decayed earthen bulwark, one demiculverin, two sacres, &c. ; but the chambers were unfurnished with \" powdre and shotte.\" At Holy well, in this parish, is a spring with waters, which it was once believed were similar in character to those of Clifton. Not far distant there was a chapel dedicated to St. Gregory. Tradition states that the French, in one of their marauding expeditions, landed here, burnt the chapel, and carried off its bell to some church in Normandy. The chroniclers are sdent as to this event. We have seen that the place was but poorly defended in Elizabethan times ; at present there are three defences \u2014 the Wish tower, one of the Martello series ; f a tower on St. Anthony's Hill, eastward in the direction of Pevensey ; and the Redoubt, a circular bomb-proof fortification, mounting 11 guns, and capable of containing 350 men. This fortress is almost sui generis, and well deserves inspection. There is a notion, quite unsupported so far as I can ascertain by the authority of records, that there was a convent of Black Friars in this town, and the old parsonage-house, near the church, is cited in evidence. This, though a very ancient edifice, * For a memoir of this distinguished gentleman, the patron of Sir Humphrey Davev, see \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 212. t These towers, whieh extend on these parts of the coast undefended by high cliffs from Seaford on the west to the coast of Kent on the east, are named after a similar tower at Myrtle, or MMartella Bay, in Corsica.

At the Lamb Inn, near at hand, there is a curious vaulted crypt of the 13th cen tury. The spider-arched roof deserves inspection ; but there is no evidence of its having been connected with any religious foundation, though the original medieval sign, the \" Holy Lamb,\" may suggest that it was a resting-place for pilgrims. The increasing population of this parish has necessitated the erection of several places of worship, both Episcopalian and Non conformist. Of the former the first built was the church of the Holy Trinity, which, originally not a very imposing structure, has been rendered still less attractive by two subsequent enlarge ments. It is a perpetual curacy in the gift of the vicar, and held by the Rev. Richard William Pierpoint, M.A. Christ Church is a more recent edifice, near the end of the Sea- side houses. A third relief church (St. Saviour's), has lately been erected at Southbourne, at the cost of George Whelpton, Esq. The Duke of Devonshire and the Hon. Mrs. Gilbert have been liberal benefactors to these edifices. A fourth church has recently been built at Meads. A convalescent hospital, on a large scale, and a pier for promenading purposes, are now in course of erection. The Roman remains which have been discovered here at different times, such as coins of Posthumus and Constantine, sepulchral urns, gold ornaments, &c, as well as the villa before mentioned, sufficiently attest the presence here of the conquerors of the world. Beachy Head is noticed in a separate article. John Hamilton Mortimer, who has been styled the \" Salvator Rosa \" of England, was born here in 1740. He manifested an enthusiastic love of art, and the productions oT his pencil and his burin are much sought after by collectors. (See memoir in \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 159.) The parish church of Eastbourne (St. Mary the Virgin) deserves careful attention. It is chiefly rich Transition-Nor man, and consists of a nave with aisles, a chancel with two manorial chapels, and a massive embattled tower at the west end. The chancel arch is slightly pointed and depressed. Ihe chancel has perpendicular sedilia, and a Perpendicular Easter sepulchre, and is divided on each side from the manorial chapels by three arches of the Transition period. The north chapel, known as the Gildridge chancel, contains several ancient memorials of the Gildridge family, and also of the Gilberts. The learned Davies Gilbert has a memorial here. Ihe south or Burton chapel belongs to the Duke of Devonshire. To particu larize all the mortuary monuments in this interesting church would far exceed the limits of this work. Ihere are some, how-"], [199, "153 EASTEEGATE. ever, which deserve special mention, as that of Henry Lushing ton, son of Henry Lushington, vicar of Eastbourne 44 years. He left England for Bengal in 1754, at the age of 16. Two years afterwards he was confined in the Black-hole at Calcutta, but was one of those who fortunately escaped. Some years later, at the age of 26, he was inhumanly put to death by Cos sim Ally Rawn, after having defended himself and killed three of his assailants with his own hand. On his monument is a marble bust. A brass plate for gjoIjamtfS ltvJ>n_J, impropriator of this church, 1445, was discovered in 1806. There are also memorials for the names of Worge, Piggot, Alchorne, De la Chambre, and many other local families. There are a few frag ments of ancient glass in the windows, and some modern glass has lately been introduced, especially that in the handsome east window of the chancel. No remains of the rood-screen exist, though two staircases leading from each chancel bi the rood loft stid remain almost entire. There is a musical peal of eight bells. [S. A. C.

This fertile and well-cultivated parish lies on the western"], [200, "154 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. verge of the Rape of Arundel. The village is a sequestered spot, remote from any considerable seat of population. Domesday Book informs us that the manor of Gate was held in free alms of Earl Roger de Montgomeri, by the Nunnery of St. Martin of Seez in Normandy. Mention is made of three hides of land, the arable being four plough-lands. On the demesne were a church, and pannage for five hogs. On the breaking out of the French war in 1415, the nuns of Seez lost their lands here, which Henry V. settled on the recently founded nunnery of Sion. They were valued at \u00a329 2s. lid. At the Dissolution, Henry VIII. seized the demesne, and since the year 1560 it has belonged to the Dean and Chapter of Chi ehester. Gates from a very early date has formed the corpus of a prebend in the Cathedral. The church (St. George) is a small building in the Early English style. It has one bell. By the will of Richard Browne, of Eastergate, 1534, he directs his son-in-law, John Eyles, to enlarge the parish church, \" longer at the west end,\" and to place there a window of three lights, at his own charge.

Domesday, Grenestede ; a parish, market town, and extinct borough, giving name to a Hundred and poor-law Union, in tbe Bape of Pevensey, on tbe borders of Surrey, on the old London road from Lewes to London, distant from the former, 20 miles ; from the latter, 30. It ha< a Bail- way station on the Three-Bridges and Tunbridge Wells branch of tbe London and Brighton line. Population in 1811, 2,804; in 1861, 4,266. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at \u00a3320 ; Patron, The Earl de la Warr ; Incumbent, Bev. John Peat, M.A., of St. Peter's College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1558. Acreage, 15,071. A very comprehensive account of this large parish is given in vol. xx. of \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" by Mr. J. C. Stenning, and many references, as will be seen below, are given in the series. The town is situated on the Forest Ridge, and commands extensive and picturesque views of the Kent and Surrey hills on the north and east, and over the great forest of Ashdown on the south-east. It consists principally of one street, with antique houses of stone and timber. As the nearest town in the county to London, it was formerly customary to hold the Lent assizes here. These assizes, to which prisoners from Hor sham and Lewes were brought, continued to be held until 1799."], [201, "155 EAST GRINSTEAD. On March 17, 1684, a singular accident occurred. It was the second day of the assize, and during a trial the floor of the Nisi Prius court, being overcrowded, gave way, sending the jury, gentlemen, counsel, solicitors, &c, into the cellar beneath. The only person who remained was the judge, whose bench was sus pended to the wall, and he continued in his proper position, \" like a salt-box, high and dry.\" No injury to life or limb was experienced by this descensus. The sessions-house was re-built the following year, but it has long disappeared. Grenestede, the ancient orthography of this place, shows its original character. It was \" the green place,\" a clearing in the great forest of the Weald. The prefix \" East,\" distinguishes it from another parish in West Sussex. Until within recent times a great deal of waste and uncultivated land remained, and the Common, once the resort of highwaymen, was only enclosed at the early part of the present century. The account of the hundred of East Grinstead given in Domesday, though very circumstantial, is confused and unsatis factory. No special manor of Grenestede is mentioned, and a great portion of the hundred was in detached manors beyond the confines of Pevensey rape. The manors at present com prised within the parish are Imberhorne, Shovelstrode, Bramble tye, Standen, Sheffield-Grinstead, Walhill, Brookhurst, and Kid brooke, though it ha\u00a3 been doubted whether the last possesses manorial rights. - Ofthese only two\" can be distinctly traced in the survey, namely \" Brambertei \" and \" Standene.\" In 44 Henry III. that king granted East Grinstead to his father-in-law, Peter of Savoy. In the reign of Edward III. it belonged to a profligate knight, Sh Thomas de Arderne, but he having killed Nicholas de Poyninge, and violated Margerie, widow of Nicholas de la Beche, the king granted it with other lands to Reginald de Cobham. In 1468-9 it was given by Edward IV. to Elizabeth, his queen-consort, for life. In 4 James I., the borough was granted in fee-farm to Sir George Rivers, and Thomas Bridges, Esq. Brambletye, well-known to the lovers of the picturesque, and to those of fiction (by Horace Smith's excellent novel, \" Bram bletye House\"), possesses a history of greater interest than the other manors. Domesday says : \" Ralph holds Brambertei of the Earl ; Cola held it of King Edward.\" It had one hide, the arable being one plough land and a half, a priest with a villein, and thirteen bondmen, a wood of twelve hogs, a mill, &c Before the Conquest it was valued at 30s., afterwards at 20s. The manor was part of the barony granted by the Conqueror to his kinsman, the Earl of Moreton and Cornwall. From the early part of Edw_.:d I. the manor was held by the famdy of De"], [202, "156 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Audeham, with whom it continued till 9 Edward III., when it belonged to John de Sancto Claro, or Seyntclere, a distinguished county family, who were subsequently connected with the fami lies of Walleys of Glynde, Gage of Firle, and Pelham of Laugh ton. The last of the male line, Sir Thomas St. Clere, died in 1435, leaving three daughters as coheiresses, the eldest of whom, Elizabeth, married as her second husband, Richard Lewknor. He is supposed to have built the old house of Bram bletye, some trifling remains of which, and the moat, still exist. The family of Lewknor, once the most influential and widely spread in Sussex, were associated with East Grinstead by pro perty, and as representatives of the borough in Parliament, for about two centuries. The history of the lordship is somewhat obscure until about the end of the reign of Elizabeth, when the Comptons were proprietors. Sir Henry Compton, K.B. (of the same family as the Earls of Northampton) married Cecilia, daughter of Robert Sackville, Earl of Dorset, and was in all probability the builder ofthe more recent mansion, Brambletye House; as his initials, and those of his wife (Mary, daughter and coheiress of John, only son of Richard, ViScount Lumley) H.M.C., with the date 1631, and the arms of Compton, remain over the entrance of the ruined mansion. The remains of this house are situated in a delightful valley not far from Forest Row. It was originally a very handsome mansion, and had towers with ogee cupolas, such as were built in the time of the early Stuarts. It is now an ivy-mantled shell, though several towers, and a de tached gateway, survive to indicate its ancient glory. The im mediate successors of the Comptons are not known, but in 1684 Sir James Richards, then created a baronet, is described as of Brambletye House. He was of French extraction, and was knighted for an act of bravery at sea. Subsequently he settled in Spain, and some of his descendants have occupied high posi tions in the Spanish army. On his quitting Brambletye the house fell to decay. From about 1714 till 1866, it belonged to the Biddulphs, and it then passed by sale to Donald Larnach, Esq. Lavortye was a sub-infeudation of Brambletye. About the end of the thirteenth century it was held by the family of Montacute, and had a private chapel in 1285. After many changes of proprietorship, it came in part in 1793 to J. Trayton Fuller, Esq. Duddleswell manor is on Ashdown Forest, and extends into this parish. Imberhorne belonged to Lewes Priory. Shovelstrode was the property, temp. Henry VIII., of John Aske, who was attainted of high treason, and the king granted it to Sir John Gage. In 1 2 James I. it was demised to John Avenn, alias Venner, for 21 years, at \u00a355 per annum, one fat bullock, and six capons. Subsequently it passed to the families of Con-"], [203, "157 EAST GRINSTEAD. yers, Major, and Henniker. Standen was subordinate to Bram bletye : it is mentioned in Domesday as having belonged in Saxon times to Azor ; afterwards to the Earl. Brookhurst, the \"Biochest\" of Domesday, passed to the Howard family, and in 16 Elizabeth, belonged to Philip, Earl of Surrey. In 3 James I. Sir Thomas Leedes, K.B., inherited it from his father, John Leedes, Esq. Kidbrooke. Of the early history of this estate little appears to be known. In 1743 an act passed for settling it on William, Lord Abergavenny, who, after residing some time at East Grin stead, and finding himself possessed of a large domain in con sequence of the death of his cousin Edward, some years pre viously, but without a suitable English mansion (for Birling and Eridge, the old family houses, were both in decay) purchased Kidbrooke, and built the present house. His descendant, the Earl of Abergavenny, having transferred his residence to Eridge, sold the estate to the Right Hon. Charles Abbott, Speaker of the House of Commons, whose grandson, Lord Colchester, is the present proprietor. Kidbrooke park, though not large, possesses many natural advantages, and to them the late Mr. Repton added many artificial improvements. East Grinstead, as a town, may lay claim to being one ofthe most old-fashioned places in Sussex. Many of the houses on the south side of the main street exhibit features similar to those which existed two or three centuries ago. Among these may be men tioned the old stone house which was formerly the Judges' lodg ing, and the post-and-panel house belonging to the school founded by Robert Payne of Newick, in 1708, and endowed with lands from a farm called Serryes. Farther on is a house which has beneath it a vaulted apartment with ribs concentra ting in a boss, with a shield containing a cross engrailed, the arms of the family of Dalyngruge of Bolebrook, in the adjoin ing parish of Hartfield, who took their name from an estate in this parish, and afterwards acquired great distinction. Beyond this are other houses of great age, with overhanging storeys and dormer windows. Foeest Row and Ashuest Wood are hamlets in this parish. (See those names.) Gulledge is a good house of the Elizabethan style. It was in the possession of the family of Alfray, or Alfrey, for many descents, from at least the year 1361, when John Alfray was M.P. for the borough. The church of East Grinstead was given, in 1078, by Alured the Cupbearer (Pincerna) to Lewes Priory. A chantry was founded in it in 1326, by William Hellindale, who endowed it with lands in East Grinstead, and rents out of the manors of Imberhorne and DuddlesweU. The patronage continued with"], [204, "158 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. the Prior of Lewes until the Dissolution, when it was granted to Queen Anne of Cleves. The church is supposed to have been dedicated to St. Edmund, but it is now called St. Swithin's. The tower of the building was struck by lightning Sept. 6th, 1683 ; the bells were melted, but the body of the church escaped. A new tower was built the next year, but it was so badly con structed that a little more than a century later, 1785, it fell down and so damaged the nave that it was necessary to pull down the whole fabric. A graphic account of the calamity is given in Mr. Stenning's article, referred to above. An Act was soon after passed for the rebuilding. The style is debased Gothic \u2014 a kind of Perpendicular \u2014 such as might have been ex pected at the time. Nevertheless it has an imposing appearance when seen from a distance, on account of its size and command ing situation. Architectural description in this case cannot be expected. The only monuments of interest are those of Wdliam, Lord Abergavenny, 1744, and a small brass of a woman and two men, representing Dame Katherine, daughter of Lord Scales, wife first of Sir Thomas Grey, and secondly of Richard Lewknor, of Brambletye. She was one of the ladies to the Queens of Edward IV. and Henry VII. She died in 1505, and, with her husband, \" founded, indued, and inorned this present church to the laude and honour of God, with dyvers ornamentes, and an almshouse of three parsons.\" Of this foundation no further record is known to remain. There is a fine peal of eight bells, cast in 1813. There was formerly a brotherhood of St. Catharine con nected with this church. Between the town and Forest Row there is a place caUed Cutton's Hill, which Mr. Stenning thinks may be a corruption of Catherine's Hill. In a small field at the north end of the town there are traces of the site of a building which by tradition was a religious house ; but no history remains. Ironworks were formerly carried on in this parish at Hammerwood, near Causiron, and at MiUplace, on the borders of West Hothly, where cannons were cast. Also at Gravetye and Ticaridge. In 1556 Thos. Dungate, John Forman, and Mother Tree, \" for righteousnes' sake gave themselves to death and tormentes of fire\" iu the town, as Martyrs ofthe Protestant religion. (Foxe.) \" Mother Tree \" is identified as Anne Tree, whose granddaughter of the same names resided in the parish, and was married, temp. Elizabeth, to Edmund Ellis, lineal ancestor to the late Mr. George EUis of East Grinstead. East Grinstead was an ancient borough, and returned mem bers to Parliament from 1 Edward IL, 1307, till the Reform Act of 1832. The right of voting was of late confined to the burgage-holders, 36 in number, and for many years 29 of these"], [205, "159 EAST GRINSTEAD. were vested in the Sackville family. Very few of these were resident, and many of them (says Mr. Durrant Cooper, Parl. Hist. Sussex, in Ilorsfield, vol. ii.) \"never saw the town except at an election, when they were conveyed thither at the expense of the patron, in the same carriages with the steward and his clerks ; and after eating a dinner at the expense of the candi dates, were handed home after the same fashion.\" The repre sentatives were mostly of old local families. The most noticeable establishment in the parish is Sackville College, founded in 1608, by Robert, second Earl of Dorset. It occupies a commanding position at the east end of the town. The building is a quadrangle, measuring externally 130 feet by 128. This is a charitable foundation, and its present consti tuents are a warden, six brethren, and six sisters, besides 24 other inmates. The pensioners have each, in addition to their rooms, the sum of \u00a314 per annum. It has recently undergone many alterations, ornamentations, and repairs, including a new chapel of medieval type. In the chapel there was the following inscription, now removed into the hall : \" I pray God bless my Lord of Dorset and my Ladie, and all their posteritie, Anno Domini, 1619.\" The detads of the history of this institution would occupy too much space for this concise work, and I must refer for them to. Mr. Stenning's elaborate account. Its early history is one of constant litigation for many years be tween the brethren and the patrons and trustees. On November 26, 1703, during the \"great storm,\" the College belfry was beaten down, the bell cracked, and much other damage done. The late Countess de la Warr, Baroness Buckhurst, repre sented her ancestor, the founder ; and the Assistant Wardens, who have a general oversight in the management, are usually gentlemen of good social position. The late Rev. J. Mason Neale, well known for his varied accomplishments and high church proclivities, was warden of the establishment from 1846 to 1867. Dr. Richard Kidder, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was a native of this place. He was killed, together with his wife, in his episcopal palace, by the falling of a chimney-stack dur ing the memorable storm just referred to. (See Memoir in \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 19.) The family of Payne in this parish are probably the most numerous race that ever existed in the county. The parish registers and public documents number them by many hundreds, both in gentle and simple degree.

This parish is remarkable in the district for its pleasant village street, and the number of excellent residences which it contains. The manor does not occur in Domesday, but it was possessed two centuries later (1296) by a family surnamed De Hodlegh. It has immemorially formed part of the manor of Laughton. Halland, the principal estate, derives its name from the old family of Halle, who, by a match with the heiress of Ore of Ore, near Hastings, became one of the most prominent fami lies of East Sussex. They continued to hold it temp. Henry"], [207, "EAST HOTHLY. 161 VIII., and then, after some changes it was purchased by Sir Nicholas Pelham of Laughton, ancestor of the Earl of Chiehester. During the reign of Elizabeth, the Pelhams erected an almost palatial mansion, which thenceforth became their principal seat, and was the scene of bountiful hospitality, especially during the time of Thomas Pelham-Holles, Duke of Newcastle, the cele brated statesman, who died in 1768. After his death, Thomas Lord Pelham dismantled the building, and it has ever since been occupied as a farm house. The extensive park was dis parked, and converted to arable and pasture. The boundary line of the parishes of East Hothly and Laughton passed through the front entrance of the house. Whiligh was, temp. Henry VII., the seat of the Lunsford family, who, for sixteen generations earlier, and down to this date, were of Lunsford in Etchingham, and of Battle. During the civil wars of the seventeenth century the Lunsfords espoused the Royalist cause, and Sir Thomas Lunsford, the head of the family, was one of the most notable men of that troublous period. The church, as it stood in 1856, consisted of a chancel, nave, south porch, and embattled tower, with stair turret. In that year, by the exertions of the present rector, the whole edifice, with the exception of the tower, was rebudt. During the removal of the decayed building, traces of a Norman church were brought to light, and a pillar piscina, of perhaps unique design, was found. The tower, which is of fifteenth century architecture, has over its doorway the arms of Lunsford and the Pelham badge, the well-known buckle. I have seen a leaden bullet which long remained fixed in the ancient oaken door. It was a great object of village curiosity, as having been fired with malice prepense by Colonel Lunsford, at Sir Nicholas Pelham, as he was going to, or out of, church on a Sunday, in the seven teenth century. The tradition has been confirmed by antiqua rian research, and it is ascertained that Lunsford was outlawed, and fined \u00a38,000. There are memorials for the names of Mittel, of the Mote in this parish, Porter, Hayward, Atkins, &c.

The Union or Incorporation of East Preston contains 19 parishes, and the workhouse is situated here. East Preston is so called to contra-distinguish it from West Preston, in the parish of Rustington, which does not appear ever to have been parochial. In the time of the Confessor Prestune was held by Ulvela, a free-woman, when it was assessed at seven hides. There were fourteen villeins, and three salt pans. It was valued at \u00a34. Temp. Richard I. and later, the De Bohuns were lords. In the reign of Elizabeth, the lordship was held by Sir Thomas Palmer, Knight, in whose family it continued many years. Henry Palmer, Esq., sold it to James Colebrooke, Esq., and it afterwards underwent several aliena tions. The encroachments of the sea, as in several adjacent parishes, have been very considerable. Several parcels of land known as Holybreads, which belonged to the glebe or to private persons, were submerged many generations since. Thus we read in a terrier of 1635, for example : \" The fourth holly -bread is in the sea ; item, Thomas Hixhood has one holly-bread which is in the sea;\" and the work of destruction has since been going on. The church (Allhallows or Our Lady ?) consists of chancel, nave, and west tower, supporting a stone spire, and north and west porches. The north door appears to be Norman, probably retained from an earlier church, and the lofty tower arch is Perpendicular. In other respects the body of the building may be regarded as Early English, though the tower is later. There are Perpendicular windows inserted, some of which are modern copies. The tower is ornamented with crosses formed with paving tiles. There is one bell inscribed to St. James. [S. A. C. Domesday watermill, v, 272. Calceto Priory had lands in, xi, 101.

The etymology may be from the Anglo-Saxon Ecen, great, and ham \u2014 the large hamlet. The surface is undulating, and in parts possesses fine timber. The River Rother passes through the parish. There is no proper village in the central portion of the parish, the majority of the inhabitants residing at Hurst- Green, a hamlet partly in Echingham and partly in Salehurst. (See Hurst-Green.) The old Lewes and Hurst-Green road passed over Burghill, which Professor Airey, in his theory of C\u00e6sar's landing at Pevensey, considers to have been the spot where the Britons entrenched themselves in a strong position, which they further fortified by cutting down trees to form a rampart. (C\u00e6sar de Bell. Gallico, v, 9.) With all respect for the great astronomical knowledge of the learned Professor, I think he shows little knowledge of the geography of these parts. C\u00e6sar's second landing took place somewhere on the shore of the narrow seas (probably near Hythe in Kent) a long distance from Pevensey, as may be inferred from his own words. He sailed from Portus Itius (Boulogne) \" quo ex portu commodis simum in Britanniam transmissum esse cognoverat, circiter millium passuum xxx. a continenti\" \u2014 thirty miles from the con tinent. Therefore neither Pevensey nor Burghdl could have lain near the great commander's route. (See Lib. v, cap. 2.) Echingham is noted for its race of barons, who were heredi tary Stewards of the Rape of Hastings. Simon de Echingham, brother and heir of William de Echingham, was sheriff of Sussex in 18th, 19th, and 20th of Henry III. His son Simon obtained free warren in Echingham and 28 other manors in Sussex. His successors William and Robert were summoned to parhament in the reigns of Edwards I. and IL, as Barons of Echyngham, and in their distinguished successors the manor appears to have vested till the reign of Elizabeth. In 39th of that reign it passed to Robert Tyrwhitt, Esq., of Ketilby in Lincolnshire, a descendant of one of the heirs female of the De Echinghams. The estate subsequently passed through the fami lies of Lytton and Warburton, until it was purchased under a chancery decree for Sir John Lade, Bart., a minor, and des cended to his successor, Sir John Lade, Bart,, about the end of the last century. For an excellent account of this great baronial race, see \" Echyngham of Echyngham,\" by Spencer Hall, F. S. A. The site of the ancient castle of the De Eching- m 2"], [210, "164 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. hams has not been ascertained. Lundresford, now Luntsford, gave name to one of the most ancient families of Sussex. They were seated here in the time of Edward the Confessor. In the fifteenth century they were of Battle, and subsequently of Whi ligh in East Hothly. In the north part of the parish is Shoyswell, which gave name to a hundred and a family. John de Shoyswell was possessor before the reign of Edward I., and his descendants remained here till their extinction, temp. James II. or William III. Haremare, another estate in the parish, also gave name to the family of Haremare in early times. The house, which stands on an acclivity to the east of the church, was built on the site of an older mansion about the middle of the sixteenth century, and was for some generations the residence and property of the family of Busbridge, with whom it continued till the middle of the eighteenth century, when a coheiress conveyed it to the family of Snepp, who were long in possession, t'ome years ago it became the property of John L. Maclean, Esq., who enlarged the ancient house, and made it a very delightful resi dence. At Seacock's Heath, on the borders of Hawkhurst, is a large mansion, the seat of William Beckwith, Esq. It was built in the first half of the eighteenth century by Arthur Gray, a well-known smuggler, connected with the notorious \" Hawk hurst gang,\" and was called \" Gray's Folly.\" The church (God, St. Mary, and St. Nicholas) was built on the site of an earlier edifice, traces of which of about the reign of King John are preserved, by Sir William de Echingham, who died in 1388. It is valuable and interesting for the boldness of its outline and proportions, for its height, and the elegance of its details. It has been considered the work of a foreign archi tect. It consists of a chancel, nave, with aisles, and a tower over the eastern bay of the nave. The latter has a stair turret, and terminates with a pyramidal cap, supporting the original banner-shaped vane, which bears the frette coat of the De Echynghams \u2014 a rare instance of a vane of such early date. The tracery of the windows is extremely elegant, especially that of the east window of the chancel. The nave has clerestory win dows. In the chancel the original stalls and chancel screen, of beautiful oak carving, remain, as well as some rich encaustic tiles. There are three sedilia and a piscina, and also several interesting brasses, particularly one for <KHtl(m. tie GMeCi)ingf)aro> the builder of the church, with a Latin inscription recording the fact. Another inscription in French rhyme, records the date of his death,y1345, and the epitaph commences thus : \" I was made and formed of earth, and now I have returned to earth. William de Echingham was my name. God have pity on my soul ; and aU you who pass by pray to Him for me.\" The effigy"], [211, "165 ECHINGHAM. is represented in the armour of the period, and lies immediately before the altar-rails. Near it is a large brass representing two knights in armour, and a lady between them, beneath a triple canopy. This is for Sir JE\u00c6HiU'imus \u00a9Cijgrtjjfjam, Lord of Ech yngham, ob. 1412 ; Lady Johanna, his wife, 1404 ; and Sir Thomas Echyngham, their son, also Lord of Echyngham, 1444. The next brass is a plate for Sir \u0152ijomag <\u00a3cf)Mj>ngf)am, Lord of Echyngham, 14S2. This Thomas was son of the Thomas last mentioned, one of whose daughters married Sir Goddard Oxen bridge, which will account for the next brass, a small one at the east end of the south aisle, representing two ladies kneeling face to face. There are two inscriptions for iSSlij. (ffieJjgngljain, eldest daughter of Thomas and Margaret Echyngham, 1452, and Slgnrs \u00a9xenlmfcgr, daughter of Robert Oxenbridge, 1482. The windows were formerly filled with painted glass, some of which remained down to 1784, when Grimm made drawings of them. Eight years earlier Hayley had recorded the blazon of the arms of the De Echynghams and their connections, includ ing numerous noble families then existing, as may be seen in his collections in the British Museum. Originally the lower lights had been filled with figures of saints, &c, but alas ! of all this painted glory only a few unimportant fragments remain, and but little to attest, in this respect, the munificence and taste of the builder. When complete and undefaced by the barbarous neglect of later times, this grand edifice must have been among the noblest of baronial churches. The building was originally surrounded by a moat, fed from the adjacent river Rother. Concerning this moat there is a marvellous legend to the effect that at the bottom of it there lies a great bell, wliich shall never be brought to light until \"six yoke of white oxen can be found to drag it forth to human view ! This romantic bed is now repre sented by a small one dated 1632, the only bell in the tower. In the nave is a monument, with a Latin inscription aud medallion bust to Henry Corbould, F.S.A, father of the well-known artist. The church underwent \" restoration \" in 1860. Before that date some relics of antiquity remained which have now dis appeared, especially the helmet, crest, and pennon of Sir George Strode, who was buried in the 17th century. [S. A. C.

Vulgo, Abberlon; a parish in the Hundred of Atrjerington and Poynings ; Bape of Bramber ; distant four miles east from Steyning ; Post- town, Hurst- Pierpoint. Eailway station and Union, Steyning. Popu- lation in 1811, 262 ; in 1861, 300. Benefice, a Bectory, valued at \u00a3379 ; Patron, the Archbishop of Canterbury ; Incumbent, Bev. J. Melville Martine, M.A., of Edinburgh University. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1561. Acreage, 2,651. This parish is supposed to derive its name from the Saxon feminine name Eadburga. King Alfred had a grand-daughter of this name, who was sister of King Edmund, and King Offa of Mercia had a daughter so caded, who was notorious for her profligacy. The parish is long and narrow, like most in this county, which seem to follow somewhat the contour of the Rapes. The church and viUage lie on the north side ofthe South Downs, where the escarpment is very steep. About one-third of the parish on the eastern side is the hamlet of Fulking, which lie3 in the rape of Lewes. Edburton is not mentioned in Domesday under that name, though Perching and Truleigh, which lie within its limits, are therein described. William de Wateville held Percinges of William de Warenne, Azor having previously held it of the Con fessor. There were anciently two \" halls,\" but these now form one manor. The assessment was for five hides and a half. There were four villeins, three bondmen, two'servi, and a wood of three hogs. Its value was 60s. Traigli (Truleigh) was held of Earl Godwin by Bedling, and was rated at four hides. After the Conquest, William, a knight, held it of William de Braose. There were three villeins, six bondmen, and two mills. The value under the Norman rule was 70s. As now existing, the principal estate in the parish consists of the farms of Perching and Edburton. These were part of the possessions of the Lords Poynings. In 1261, Robert Aguylon, or De Aquila died pos sessed of the manor of Edburton. This family, formerly of great importance in the district, must have had a considerable mansion at Perching, for in 1260 the King gave license to Robert Aguylon and his heirs to enclose and fortify their manor house of \" Percingeres \" with a fosse, and a wall of stone and lime, and to embattle the same without impediment. A second license to another Robert Aguylun, probably son of the prece ding, was granted in 1268, to the same effect. We also find the manor of Edburton belonging to the family of De Arderne, in the fourteenth century. In the reign of Henry VIII. the estate was settled on Sir Anthony Browne, Viscount Montague, and so descended as Poynings. On this estate was a fulling-mill, said"], [213, "167 EGDEAN. to have been erected by some Dutch refugees, temp. Elizabeth. It would exceed our bounds to follow the descent of manorial property in this parish, but the names of Bellingham, Pellat, Hippesley, Kilner, Higambottom, Olive, Leeves, Lamport, Gog ney, Johnson, Wyndham, Had, Covert, Northo, and others \" long to rehearse,\" have been connected with it at different periods. Among other ancient families connected with this parish was that of Beard, originally, I believe, a branch of the Beards of Rottingdean, where they have existed for many generations. In the Heralds' visitation of 1634, there is a pedigree commen cing with the reign of Henry VII. It is stated that John Beard of Cowfold had lands there, and was ranger of St. Leonard's Forest, temp. Queen Mary, \" and lieth buried in the church there under a fayre marble, and having no issue, Beard of Abbeeton did inherit his estate.\" Here they seem to have resided for four generations, but ultimately removed into Hampshire. The church (St. Andrew ?) consists of a nave, chancel, and a low tower at the west end, mostly in the Early English style. In a chapel of later date on the north side, William de Northo founded a chantry in 1319. The font is of lead, circular, with an arcade and other ornaments, denoting the Early Norman era. (Cartwright.) There are memorials to the names of Shephard, Willan, Hippesley, Pellat, &c. The tower contains three beds, two of which are dedicated to St. Catherine and St. Anne. [S. A. C.

The village is pleasantly situated at the base of their northern es carpment. Osbern, Bishop, held the manor of King Edward the Confessor, and at the date of Domesday remained in un disturbed possession. Among other possessors, Ralph, priest of the parish, held one hide of land, annexed to the church. In 1290 Henry Husee was lord ; and subsequently it was held as Trotton by the family of Camoys. Lord Robert Spencer pur chased it in 1807 of Sir Charles Mille, Bart. The church has Saxon or Early Norman features, and may be the identical building mentioned in Domesday. The chancel is Early English. The building is now disused, and the parish ioners attend Divine services at Treyford. The Rev. W.

Boudier, M.A., of that Col- lege. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1570. Acreage, 5,719. There are several excellent residences in the parish. This place probably derives its name from two Anglo- Saxon words, signifying the \" Yew-tree wood.\" The village is pleasingly situated on an elevation commanding extensive views. The soil is light sand, fertile, and wed calculated for the growth of hops, as many as 400 acres having sometimes been cultivated with that uncertain plant. The river Rother forms the bound ary between this parish and Kent. In the time of the Confessor it was rated at six hides, the arable being 20 ploughlands, and there was a wood of 10 hogs. After the Conquest it was held by the Earl of Eu in domain. Temp. Edward II. Stephen Bur gherse (or Burwash) possessed it. Since the year 1427, the manor, or portions of it, has been associated with the names and families of Malvyle, Coding, Alard, Pelham, Fynes (Lord Dacre), Ashburnham, Sharnden, Tufton, Bromfield, Webster, and Pix. Temp. Edward IV. it was held by the service of 1\u00a3 Knights' fees. T. Smith Pix, Esq., is now lord of the manor. Ewhurst Place, or Court Lodge, which was formerly a house of considerable importance, stands near the church. In the early part ofthe 17th century it belonged to the family of Mud dle, whose ultimate heiress conveyed it by marriage to Nath aniel PoweU, Esq. This gentleman took an active interest in the cause of the Stuarts, and in reward of his services Charles II. created him a Baronet, in 1662. His great-grandson, Chris topher Powell, aliened it to the Webster family. It afterwards passed to the names of Hilder and Hoffman. The ancient East Sussex family of Weekes occupied the mansion for some time, as tenants of the Powells. Soggs was formerly the property and residence of the family of Chester, the last of whom was Samuel Chester, Esq. From them it came to the family of Dawes, to whom, I believe, it still belongs. The hundred of Staple derives its name from a place in this parish, and a hamlet still bears the name of Staple Cross. Vine yards are said to have flourished in Ewhurst in ancient times. The church (dedication unknown) consists of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, square west tower, shingled spire, and west porch, The building exhibits a great mixture of styles, Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. The east window of three lights contains some ancient painted glass. The north wall appears to be the oldest part of the body of the building (Hussey). There is a small brass to 223.11s (ftrgsfort, 1520. This name still remains in East Sussex."], [216, "170 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. [S. A. C. Church, xiii, 137. Tithes to Hastings College, ibid.

The annexation took place in 1528, when Bishop Robert Sherburne bought the Rectory of the Abbot and Convent of Bayham, to whom it had most likely been given by Ela de Dene (afterwards Sackville), an ancestress of the Earls and Dukes of Dorset. Upon the acquisition of this rectory, Sherburne founded the Prebend of \" Excetes\" in the Cathedral of Chi ehester. The reason assigned for throwing the parish into that of West Dean was the paucity of the inhabitants, and their in ability to maintain the fabric ofthe church. In the year 1587, when a survey of the Sussex coast was made, in anticipation of the descent of the Spanish Armada, the church was still stand ing, and it is marked on the map. Its site is yet traceable in dry summers on the Downs, to the right hand of the highway lead ing from Seaford to Friston. It was a very small edifice, and I have in my possession a fragment, in green sandstone, of a very ancient font, which was found some time since within the foundations of the ancient church. Exceit bridge, now a very inconsiderable structure, was formerly a long one, for passage over the estuary of the river Cuckmere, the outlet of which is about a mile southward. FAIKLIGHT. Domesday, Luet? vulgo, Fare-lye ; a parish in the Hundred of Guest- ling, Eape of Hastings ; distant three miles east from Hastings, its Post-town, Bailway station, and Union. Population in 1811, 385 ; in 1861, 600. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at \u00a3635 ; Patron and Incumbent, Bev. Henry Stent, M.A., of Exeter College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1651. Acreage, 3,309. Chief Land- owners, W. D. Lucas Shadwell, Esq., and Sarah, Countess Walde- grave. Fairlight occupies a lofty and commanding situation on the coast of East Sussex, and the Down reaches an elevation of 599 feet above the sea level. This down is well known for its extensive and varied scenery, not only of the home landscape, but, in a clear sky, of the Continent, particularly the hills in the neighbourhood of Boulogne. This spot is much frequented"], [217, "171 FAIRLIGHT. in summer by pleasure parties from Hastings, and no wonder, considering the vast expanse over which the eye may wander. It is said that from this charming height there are visible no less than 10 towns, 2 harbours, 3 bays, 66 churches, 5 castles, 70 Martedo towers, 1 lighthouse, 2 monumental towers (Heath field and Boulogne), and 40 windmills ! The South Foreland, on the east, and Beachy Head on the west \u2014 80 mdes apart \u2014 \u2022 may be easily descried in favourable weather. In this parish is the \" Dripping Well.\" From beneath a magnificent beech tree at the head of that lovely spot, Fairlight Glen, springs a smaU stream, which drops from the level clown a nearly perpen dicular sand rock, in most romantic fashion. \" The best of all is the waterfall, And the dripping of the stream. Drip ! Drip ! Drip ! The water still falls on the mossy lip Of the old grey stones in the stream.\" Indeed there are few spots in the South of England so pic turesque, for an admixture of rock, foliage, and water. The \" Lovers' Seat\" is another favourite place of resort. This beau tiful spot is connected with a romantic legend of the last century, from which it appears that Lieutenant Lamb of the Rye family, and Miss Boys of Elfords in this parish, were the lovers in question. The sea view from this spot is beautiful. The Domesday account of Fairlight is very obscure. Hors field's statement is, I think, erroneous. It must surely be the Luet mentioned under the Hundred of Ghestlinges. The manor extends into the parishes of Guestling, Fairlight, and Ickle sham. Temp. Henry III. Wdliam de St. Leger obtained a charter of free warren in Farlegh. He also held 3f knights' fees here of Alice, Countess of Eu. The manor gave name to a family of De Feyriegh, who held a knight's fee here. In 31st Henry VI. John Passelewe was lord. Temp. Elizabeth it passed to the Sackvilles, and afterwards to the Ashburnhams. French Court, a small manor in the north of the parish, belongs to W. D. L. Shadwell, Esq. There have been several families of county position connected with Fairlight. Guysons was the seat of the Carletons, one of whom, Dr. Guy Carleton, was Bishop of Chiehester in 1678 ; and Stonelinch manor belonged to the family of Crumpe. Fairlight Place belongs to Sarah, Countess Waldegrave, and is beautifully situated. Fairlight Had, the property and residence of W. D. Lucas Shadwell, Esq., is an elegant and capacious modern man sion in the Early Tudor style. The church occupies a lofty site. The building, as it stood a few years since, consisted of a chancel, nave, and tower, with"], [218, "172 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Early English features. It had a lofty shingled spire, which was a valuable land-mark. Leland, speaking of a descent of the Spaniards (an error for the French), says that they landed (a.d. 1380) \" by night at Farely, where the high steepel is, about a iii. miles from Winchelsey,\" and burnt the latter place. The old church was pulled down in 1845, and the present struc ture erected. It is in the later style of Early English architec ture, and consists of a nave, a north aisle, with an embattled tower at its west end, a south porch, and a vestry. There are memorials for the names of Frewen and Adye, vicars, and others. The bell is ancient, and is inscribed \" Sit nomen Domini benedictum.\" [S. A. C. Vicarage, xiii, 141. Franckes of, xiv, 101.

The lofty situation of this village, midway between Lewes and Brighton, necessitates wells 300 feet in depth, and the water supply is principally from Falmer Pond, a well-known resort for skaters. The manor extends into many adjacent parishes. Fale mere and Bevedene (Bevingdean) both occur in Domesday, but the descent of the manors is very obscure. At the dissolution of the monasteries Henry VIII. granted Falmer to Thomas, Lord Cromwell, and subsequently to Queen Anne of Cleves. Local tradition assigns to that unfortunate princess a residence here, but no evidence can be adduced. In the seventeenth century the family of Craven were lords, and in 1765 Sir John Shelley purchased it for \u00a330,000. At a later date Thomas, Lord Pel ham, became its owner, and it now belongs to his descendant, the Earl of Chiehester. Bevbndean, a secluded abode in a deep recess of the Downs, belonged to the family of Geere; after wards to the late W. C. Mabbott, Esq.; and subsequently to the late Charles Beard, Esq."], [219, "173 FARNHURST. Boemee, a hamlet or chapelry of this parish, pertained eccle siastically, as also did Falmer, to the Priory of Lewes : it now belongs to Lord Chiehester. The chapel has long been destroyed, but some years since I discovered a portion of its ancient font. It is mentioned in Domesday as Burgemere, and as possessing a church. In 1 849 some labourers, while digging for flints in a dean, or bottom, called Buckman's Hole, on Bormer Farm, discovered a Roman cemetery. It was very slightly elevated above the surrounding land, and in it 13 small vases, mostly perfect, were found, together with fragments of iron, and a small glass vessel. The area was circular, about 40 yards across, and very singularly surrounded with a tiny hedge of ferns (common brakes) not found elsewhere in the neighbourhood. The relics are preserved at Lewes Castle. In Norden's unpublished survey of the manor of Falmer, 1617, it is stated that three brothers named Goringe, living respectively at Amberley, Piddinghoe, and Rottingdean, were villeins, or \" bondmen of blood,\" and were the absolute property of the lord of this manor \u2014 and probably, as a writer in \" Notes and Queries\" remarks (Dec. 9, 1849), \" the last of the villeins.\" The church, which was rebuilt in 1817, contains nothing par ticularly worthy of remark.

About a fourth part of the parish is brought into culture, the remainder consisting of sand, water, and wood. The village is situated in the south-east district of the parish. The manor does not appear in Domesday, and indeed there seems but little history connected with it. In 22nd Henry VIII. it was granted to Sir William Fitzwilliam, and from that time it has descended as Cowdray. Farnhurst, or Farn, was originally a chapel of ease to Eisebourne, but it has long been an independent parish. Verdley Castle is in this parish. (See Verdley.)"], [220, "174 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Noeth Ambeesham, though now a ty thing of Farnhurst, was originally a hamlet of the parish of Steep, in Hampshire, and still pajTs tithes to that parish. It is a narrow strip of land running from the northern boundary of the county in a direction north and south for several miles. The lower or southern por tion is the hamlet of South Ambersham. By the operation of the County Boundaries Act, 7 and 8 Victoria, Ambersham was detached from Hampshire, and for ecclesiastical purposes the northern portion was annexed to Farnhurst, and the southern to Easebourne. In 1861 the population was 111. The church or chapel (St. Margaret) has a small nave and chancel of Early English architecture, and a shingled spire with two bells.

This maritime parish is very fertile. The village lies a short distance from the sea, and contains a viUa erected about the year 1800, by Wdliam Hayley, the poet. It was fitted up with every appliance of pleasure and luxury, and contained many treasures of art, and a handsome library. Felpham, sometimes written Felgeham, belonged to King Alfred, and was bequeathed by him to Osferth, his nephew, together with Rotherfield, Ditchling, Lyminster, &c. Before the Conquest it was held by the Abbey of Shaftesbury, of E Iward the Confessor, and was rated at twenty-one hides ; afterwards Roger de Montgomeri held it as part of his Earldom of Arundel, when it was valued at 15^ hides. There were a church, a fishery, a wood of thirty hogs, and six burgesses in Chiehester"], [221, "175 FERRING. pertaining to the manor. Under the Norman government it was valued at \u00a320. At the dissolution of the monasteries it was granted first to Sir Thomas Whyte, and afterwards to Sir William Goring, of Burton. After several alienations it became, about the year 1800, the property of Mr. William Pellatt. Flansham, which anciently had a chapel, and Ancton, are two small hamlets in the parish. The former was manorial, belonged to the Earldom of Arundel, and contained two knights' fees. The seaboard of Felpham has suffered greatly from the incur sions of the ocean. In the Non\u00e6 Roll, 1341, it is stated that 100 acres of arable and pasture had recently been submerged, and the corroding process has been going on at intervals ever since. The church (Our Lady) consists of chancel, nave, with narrow north and south aisles, south porch (rebudt), and square western tower. Mr. Hussey remarks that it is constructed of such bad stone, and has suffered so much injury, that the exterior is diffi cult to explain. The chancel seems to be of the Decorated period. The piscina and south door have ogee heads. There are also features apparently Norman and Early English ; the chancel arch is Perpendicular. There are a few monumental inscriptions to the names of Sparkes, Steele, &c. Two remark able men found sepulture at Felpham, William Hayley, the poet, formerly of Eartham, the friend of Cowper and Romney, and Dr. Cyril Jackson, the eminent scholar, Dean of Christ Church, who, after quitting his arduous duties in the University, retired to Felpham to end his days. He had been tutor to Prince George (George IV.), and he declined two bishoprics, preferring a quiet life here to the cares of ecclesiastical office. He died in 1819.

This seaboard parish derives its name from the Anglo-SaxoiT Fearring, \" the pasture of horses.\" Before the removal of the episcopal see from Selsey to Chiehester, it formed part of the endowment of that bishopric, and at the date of Domesday it belonged to Chiehester. In the time of Edward the Confessor it was taxed at twelve hides, but was afterwards reduced to eight. There were fifteen villeins, fourteen bordars, and one serf. The meadow-land was twenty acres, and there was wood for four hogs. Ansfrid held two hides with four bordars. Both before and after the Conquest it was worth \u00a37. Bishop Hilary held Ferring and the annexed manor called Fure, which ex- tended into certain parishes of the Weald, before 1160. The family of Walwayne held it on lease from 1535. It was seized by the Parliament in 1 647, and sold to Anthony Stapley. Sub- sequently it was leased to William Westbrooke, Esq. Later, Sir John Shelley, Bart., possessed it, and his son transferred it to the family of Henty, its present possessors. Among the legends connected with St. Richard de la Wych, who was lord of Ferring, that holy person performed a miracle at this place by feeding 3000 persons with food that had been prepared for only 90 (see \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 243). A narrative of this act was placed under the saint's portrait, in the south transept of Chiehester Cathedral. From the Westbrookes, Ferring passed to the family of Richardson, and they resided in the adjacent parish of Findon. Kingston, a distinct parish, which formerly had its own chapel, long since destroyed by the encroachments of the sea, and East Peeston, another ecclesiastical district, are now united with Ferring; and these combined districts were formed into the prebend of Ferring, in Chiehester Cathedral, by Bishop Hilary. The particulars of this complicated union are given by Dallaway. (Rape of Arundel, pp. 31-33.) The church contains features of very early date, with memo- rials to the names of Westbrooke, Johnson, Minshull, Richard- son, Penfold, Layfield, Mason, Albright, &c. In the northern part of the parish is Highdown Hill, on the summit of which is a small earthwork measuring about 300 feet by 180. At the south-west angle formerly stood a windmill, very conspicuous as a landmark, and occupied by John Olliver, who prepared a tomb for himself very near it, and was there buried in 1793, at the age of 84. It is ornamented with texts of scripture, and with some verses of his own composition. This strange object, and the large sweep of landscape com- manded by Highdown Hill from Beachy Head to the Isle of Wight, attract numerous pleasure parties from Worthing and other neighbouring places."], [223, "177 FIN DON.

The village is situated in a valley of the South Downs. Before the Norman Conquest it was held by Harold ; after wards by William de Braose. A church ancl six ministri are mentioned in Domesday. In the time of the Confessor it was valued at \u00a328, and at the date of the Survey at \u00a328 10s. Con cerning this parish, Cartwright observes : \u2014 \" The fine down, with frequent patches of underwood, furze ancl juniper, would be at all times favourable for the sports of hunting and hawking, in that semi-barbarous age the only employment ofthe English Baron, when disengaged from the Crusade abroad, or rebellion at home.\" The monks of Dureford, as fond of sport as the laity, had free-warren in Fynden in 1189. The manor passed in dower to Margaret, widow of John de Braose, who was killed by a fall from his horse in 1232. He was buried in Lewes priory, and his truncated effigy still remains in Southover church. The widow married Walter Clifford, who obtained, in 45 Henry III., a grant of free-warren, a fair, and a weekly market. The last mentioned part of the grant seems hardly necessary for so small a place, and it led to litigation a few years later, as being in jurious to common justice to the neighbourhood. (Cartwright's \" Bramber,\" p. 87.) In 10th Edward I., William de Braose was lord, and a forest is mentioned. The subsequent descent is through the Mowbrays, and in the reign of Henry VIII. Sir Edward Shelley was owner. Afterwards, temp. James I., it was in the possession of Richard, Earl of Dorset. In 1650, John Cheale, of Perching in Edburton, Esq., became owner of the manor. John Cheale, Esq.,NorroyKing-of-Arms,bequeathed it to his nephew, William Green, Esq., who sold it to the family of Richardson. Mr. Cheale built the mansion of Findon Place N"], [224, "178 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. on the site of an older residence, and the Richardson family afterwards enlarged it. Findon Park, at the north-east of the parish, adjoining the Wiston \"estate, has passed through the families of Shelley and Shirley, to that of Goring. There is another estate, which has passed since 1750 through the fami lies of Fagg, Cripps, Groome, and Penfold. (For Muntham, see that article.) Cissbuet, including the manor of Sheepcombe, is a principal estate in this parish. In 1657 it belonged to Sir John Leeds, and was sold by his son, in 1663, to Sir John Fagg. By his descendant, Charles Fagg, it was conveyed in 1730 to William Cripps, whose grandson, William Groom, disposed of it in 1794 to his nephew, Hugh Penfold, Esq., grandfather of Hugh Wyatt, Esq., L.L.D., the present possessor. For an account of the celebrated earthwork called Cissbury, see under Broadwater. The church (St. John Baptist), surrounded by picturesque trees, is a pleasant object. Cartwright describes it as \" of ir regular architecture, consisting of nave, north aisle, and chancel, the eastern end ofthe aisle being terminated by an Early English sepulchral chapel.\" There is (or was \u2014 for this is one of the Sussex churches which I have not visited) a transeptal chapel on the south side of the edifice. The building has Norman features. In the chancel are two sedilia. The tower, at the west end, has a shingled spire. The font is Norman, and there are memorials of the names of ffiiHjftt .dFtCIUl), Richardson, Lyall, Frankland, Pilkington, Metcalfe, Payne, Swinburne, Cheale, Green, Cooke, &c. Galfridus de Aspall, rector of Fin don, \"pluralized pretty well in his time \" (as Fuller would say). In 1276, besides being rector of this parish, he had a benefice in London, two in the diocese of Lincoln, one in Rochester, one in Hereford, one in Coventry, one in Salisbury, and only seven in Norwich ! Not content with this he became canon of St. Paul's, and master of St. Leonard's Hospital at York \u2014 only 1 7 prefer ments altogether ! About the walls of the church and church yard of Findon a very rare plant occurs in great beauty \u2014 the \" cotyledon umbilicus.\" On the crown of a hill called Tormur, between Findon and Littlehampton, about half a century ago, several Roman urns were found immediately beneath the turf, without a tumulus of any kind \u2014 \"Sit terra tibi levis,\" was doubtless in the mind of the classical undertaker.

This pleasant village and parish lie at the foot of the South Downs, and are surmounted by the conspicuous eminence known as Firle Beacon, which reaches the height of 820 feet from the level ofthe sea, being one of the highest points of the Downs. Why it is called West-Firle is not known, there being no other Firle near it except the farm of Frog-Firle, in Alfriston. The parish, with the exception of a few tenements, belongs wholly to Lord Gage, whose careful oversight of it is evidenced by the neatness of its farms and cottages. Before the time of the Conqueror the manor was held by the abbey of Wilton, and was rated at 48 hides. At the Conquest it was transferred to the Earl of Moreton. Its Domesday valua- tion is \u00a344 10s, so that it must have been a large estate. Temp. Edward III., it, or rather apart of it, belonged to Michael de Poynings. At a later period it was the possession of the St. Cleres, a family of Norman descent connected with Aston Clinton, co. Bucks, and with East Grinstead in Sussex. The manor of Heighten, partly in this parish, was called Heighten St. Clere, from that circumstance. A small hamlet still bears the name of Heighton Street. The manor of Hosiers, in Firle, has been for several centuries in the Gage family. In 1486, by the mar- riage of Sir John Gage with Eleanor, third daughter and co- heiress of Thomas St. Clere, Firle was conveyed to his family. This applies, however, to only a part of Firle, for it is certain that Bartholomew Bolney, of Bolney, had a manor in West Firle from about 1440 tid 1476, and that his daughter Agnes carried it by marriage to William Gage, father of Sir John Gage, K. G. I think the Gages, father and son, must each have made acquisi tions in this parish by marriage respectively with St. Clere and Bolney.* However this may be, the lineal descendant of Sir John, and William his son, Lord Viscount Gage, is now* pos sessor. This family has produced several eminent personages, and has been elevated in two branches to the baronetage, and in * Query : May not the Heighton St. Clere part of the parish have anciently been called East Firle ?

(See Gage's \" History of Hengrave.\") Firle Place occupies a pleasant sheltered spot in a good park, and commands extensive views of the circumjacent country and of the Weald. Some portions of the house, though much altered, may date from the 15th cen tury ; the principal apartments are, however, of much later date. The hall is a perfect museum, the objects being chiefly zoological ; and the picture-gallery has many very valuable paintings, particularly one by Holbein of Sir John Gage, K. G., who held important offices in the court of Henry VIII., and another ofthe celebrated Penelope Darcy, who lived in the 17th century, and who had, from her great personal charms, three lovers at once, who used to quarrel over her. She put an end to this by declaring that if they would be patient she would marry them all in their turns, which she actually did, the first selection being Sir George Trenchard ; the second, Sir John Gage ; and the third Sir William Hervey. (See \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 281.) Ferlesis the corpus of a prebend in Chiehes ter cathedral. The church (St. Peter) is a large ancient building of chancel, nave with aisles, south porch, and west tower containing two bells. The south aisle was most evidently the ancient burial place ofthe Gages, and it was at the eastern end of this aisle that Sir John Gage, K. G., founded a chantry and made pro vision for an honest priest to sing for his soul, and to have meat, drink, and lodging in his house at Firle, for ever. But, at a considerably later date, a descendant commemorated the family by erecting a monumental chapel on the north side of the chan cel, in which he placed not only the older memorials from the south aisle, but monuments in a later style. The principal of these is a grand altar-tomb, with the recumbent effigies of Sir John Gage, K.G., and Phillipa Guldeford, his wife, finely ex ecuted, and accomjtanied by heraldric ornaments. Round the verge is the passage from Job : \" Scio quod Redemptor meus vivit,\" &c. On a brass plate at the east of the tomb, against the wall, is another inscription, with the arms of Gage and St. Clere, quarterly, to the same personages ; this was evidently, I think, the memorial originally placed in the chantry in the south aisle. Sir John's titles are given as Knight oi\" the Garter, Constable of the Tower of London, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, &c. On an altar-tomb beneath a recess in the north wall are the brass effigies of Sir Edward Gage, son of Sir John (ob. 1568), and Elizabeth Parker, his wife, with an inscription on a brass plate. His son and successor, John Gage, Esq., who died in 1595, is represented on another altar-tomb, with effigies of himself and his two wives, Elizabeth and Margaret. Thomas"], [227, "FISHBOURNE. 181 Gage, Esq., third son of Sir Edward, with Elizabeth his wife, and a son and two daughters, is also commemorated by a brass. There are other brass plates for Bartholomew Bolney and Eleanor his wife, whose daughter, by this marriage, was mother of the great Sir John Gage \u2014 date 1476. There are few series of family monuments in East Sussex of equal interest with those in this chapel. There is, or was, in the parish chest, a loose brass plate for Mary, daughter of William Howard, grandson of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, and ancestor of the Earls of Carlisle ; she died at Firle in 1638, aged 36. There are other memorials for the names of Moreton, Levett, and Swaffield, connected with vicars of the parish. The church has recently been repaired, and is extremely neat and well kept. On an eminence in Firle park is a circular tower of modern construction, which commands an extensive view, and enables a communication to be made with his Lordship's keepers at Plashet deer-park in Ringmer, about seven mdes distant.

The estate of Lee, or Lygh, in this parish, gave name to the ancient family of Lee, from whom it passed by sale, before 1634, to the Stanleys, who held it till 1779, when it was purchased by George, Earl of Egremont. Over the door of the present farm-house is the date 1492 (Dal laway). The families of Levitt and Edsaw were also proprietors here. Fittleworth is a prebend in Chiehester Cathedral.

Wilson, Bart. This large Wealden parish, on the river Ouse, presents several points of interest. Its town-village is small and neat, and the fine timber with which the parish abounds is very attractive, as are also its parish church and the fine domain of Sheffield Park. Perhaps no place in East Sussex forms so good a study for the arborist. In 1771 two oak trees in Sheffield Park, containing more than 23 loads of timber, were sold for the use of the Royal Navy at Chatham. Each tree was drawn by 24 horses, but even these strong teams could only drag on their burthen, at 4^ miles a day, to Landport, near Lewes. Thence they were floated down the Ouse to Newhaven, where they were embarked with great difficulty for Chatham. There is much common land in the parish, and it was upon Fletching Common, that on the night preceding the Battle of Lewes, in 1264, the Baronial army encamped, the Bishop of Worcester spending the night in confessing and shriving the soldiery, and urging them to stout acts on the morrow. Before the Conquest, Cano held the manor of the Confessor. Afterwards Morin and Hugo held Flescinges of the Earl of Moreton. The woody state of the country is shown by there having been pannage for 30 hogs \u2014 an unusual number. It passed later to the family of Bardolf. William Bardolf, in 38 Henry III., obtained free warren for Flesang. In 29 Henry VI. Reginald West, Lord la Warre, was seised. In 6 Henry VIII., the reversion of the manor was granted to Nicholas Carew. It has since passed through many eminent owners, and now forms part of the estate of the Earl of Sheffield. Sheffield is an important part of Fletching. Sheffield Place is situated in an extensive and noble park, abounding with the timber of ages, of great beauty, and is well watered. Respect ing the original house, nothing is known except that it is said to have had two quadrangles ; but successive alterations have obliterated most traces of the old mansion. As it stands, it is modern-Gothic, with towers and battlements. In the chapel there is a large and handsome window. The house is externally decorated with shields of the arms of the successive proprietors"], [230, "184 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. of the estate from early times. The garden is said to be 100 acres in extent. Sheffield was purchased of John, Lord De la Warr, for \u00a331,000, by John Baker Holroyd, Esq., who was raised to the peerage in 1780, as Baron Sheffield, and afterwards advanced as Earl of Sheffield. He was the patron, or rather the intimate friend, of Gibbon the historian, who passed much time here, and was buried in the church. Lord Sheffield was a man of much energv and intellectual power. His character is well set forth in an elegant Latin epitaph by the late Rev. Hugh-James Rose, B.D. His portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir M. A. Shee. At his death he was succeeded by his son George- Augustus, the present noble owner of the estate. To the north of Sheffield Park is Series, the seat of the Wilson family. Near the end of the reign of Elizabeth, John Wdson, an eminent barrister, resided at Sheffield Place. His third son, William, a distinguished loyalist, who was lord of one of the Eastbourne manors, was created a baronet by Charles II. In his descendants, Series, a competent mansion and estate, stid vests. The church (St. Andrew and St. Mary) is a large and hand some edifice, of great interest. It consists of a chancel, nave with aisles, north and south transepts, and west tower, with shingled spire, which rises to the elevation of 100 feet. The tower is of Norman work, with double windows high up in the walls divided by balusters, and the door, opening into the church, has a semi-circular arch, with a zig-zag moulding. The entire body of the building was probably Norman, but at present it is mostly Early English. The east window is very large, and of geometric pattern. The floor of the nave is in three gradations, rising towards the chancel, which is separated from the nave by a wooden screen of different periods. The transepts are entered from the nave each by a good arch, probably of the date of about 1340, when it is conjectured that the northern one was made a chantry, as a piscina of that date is still remaining. The tower contains six modern beds. The architecture of this fine church has been minutely described by the Rev. Frederick Spurred, in \" Sussex Collections,\" vol. iv. In the south transept, on an altar tomb, is a fine canopied brass for a knight and his lady, with the armorial cross engrailed of the Dalyngruges. It is of about the date of 18 Richard IL, and is believed to commemo rate Sir Walter Dalyngruge, who held, towards the end of the 15th century, lands in this and adjoining parishes. In the same transept is a handsome Elizabethan marble tomb to Richard Leche, Esq., 1596, and Charity his wife, recumbent figures of whom lie beneath a canopy. At the extremity of the north transept, and budt as a continuation of it, is a mausoleum,"], [231, "185 FOLKINGTON. erected by the late Earl of Sheffield, \" suis sibique.\" It is a large erection, and has in front several inscriptions, including one to the memory of Gibbon, by Dr. Parr, and another (before-men tioned), by H.

This person was a participant in the insurrection of Jack Cade in 1450, and is called \" Peter Dynot, glover.\" In the chancel is preserved a small monumental slab, 2ft. 8in. long, with an embossed cross. The Parish Begister contains entries from 1669 to 1736 of baptisms and burials of the Nevilles, \"Lords Bergavenny;\" and in 1748, the Right Honourable Anne, Lady De la Warr, was buried. [S. A.C.

It has a Railway station on the line from Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells. In 1826 it was consti tuted an ecclesiastical district. The church (Holy Trinity) con sists of a chancel, nave, and tower with spire. The benefice is a perpetual curacy, yearly value \u00a3150, in the gift of the Vicar of East Grinstead, and held by the Rev. Jos. Adkins Beckett, M.A. There are large National schools and Congregational and Baptist chapels. Brambletye House and Kidbrooke Park, men tioned under East Grinstead, are near this place. In the vicinity are Ashdown House, the seat of F. C. Hyde, Esq. ; Thornhill, Mrs. Hoper ; Pixton, Major F. Moore ; Stonehouse, Cuthbert Larking, Esq. ; Twyford Lodge, Robert Trotter, Esq. ; Court-in-Holme, A. E. Campbell, Esq. ; Ashurst Wood, Mrs. Wilson ; and several other capital residences. The population of the ecclesiastical district in 1861 was 1,411. Forest Row is so called from its proximity to the great Forest of Ashdown, and originated in the building of hunting lodges \u25a0for the use of the noblemen and gentlemen who made sport there when \" Lancaster Great Park\" was in existence. A more de sirable spot could scarcely be found ; the venison was plentiful, and the scenery and bracing air delightful. The district abounds in picturesque beauty. Near Forest Row are a farm and mid called Tablehurst, the ancient site of a mansion of the famdies of Pickering and Turner. FRAMFIELD.

Seats, Framfield Place, Alexander Donovan, Esq. ; Stonebridge, long the residence of the Stone Family ; Whar ton Grange, Major-General Henry Todd ; Highlands, Mrs. Baines. This large wealden parish is agreeably diversified with meadows, pasture, woods, commons, and hop gardens. There are several excellent houses, particularly Framfield Place, the residence of Alexander Donovan, Esq., which contains many good pictures, collected by his father, the late Alexander Dono van, Esq. About a mile south-east of the church is a large old mansion, called New Place, which, as well as Stone-Bridge, was long the residence of the ancient family of Stone. Bentley Park, now the estate of the noble family of Gage, was the resi dence of a junior branch of that family. It was in old times a mansion of large extent, and possessed a park, as well as the neighbouring woody domain called Plashet Park. Hempsted, now a farm, was, temp. Henry VII., the residence of the War nett family, who became extinct about 160 years since. It then passed to the Godmans for four generations, and was subse quently the property of the families of Capel and Smith. High lands, formerly a mansion of the Woodward family, ancient in Sussex, has the advantage of well-wooded scenery and an ex tensive sheet of water. Streele is another residence of consi derable antiquity, wliich also belonged to the Woodwards. Tickeridge is the site of iron-works, where a flour mill bearing that name still exists. Whartons is a small though convenient mansion, formerly the abode of Sir Joseph Aylofl'e, Bart., the well-known antiquary, who died in 1781. The family of Stapley, Baronets, afterwards of Patcham, were long settled in Framfield. The manor of Framfield is extensive, and includes more or less of the parishes of Framfield, Buxted, Uckfield, and Isfield. It was anciently a beadlewick, attached to the Deanery of South Mailing, and became part of the great church property ac quired, after the Dissolution, by Sir Thomas Palmer. From him it passed to the Tuftons and Sackvilles. Another manor, called Arches and Gote, belonged, temp. Elizabeth, to the Sussex family of Thatcher, who sold it early in the sixteenth century to the Peckhams of Tarble Down, and subsequently of Arches, where they remained until the year 1770, at which period, on the death of William Peckham, Esq., it passed to his co heiresses, who married respectively Woodward and Courthope. Tarble Down is generally called Terrible Down by the rustics, who have a tradition that a tremendous battle was once fought there, when the combat was so fierce that the soldiers waded up to their knees in blood ! There may have been a skirmish"], [235, "189 FRAMFIELD. about this spot in connection with the Battle of Lewes in 1264. An old ploughman told me, some years ago, that he had ex humed in the course of his work some ancient pieces of iron, which he thought were swords. The Archbishops of Canter bury formerly had a mansio or resting-place at Tarble Down, and its site was pointed out in the last generation. The family of Isted \u2014 a name still well known in East Sussex \u2014 were some time resident as gentry in the parish, but their habitation is not exactly ascertained ; and that of Hodgson had the estate and iron-works of Poundsley in the seventeenth century. The vicarage belonged from an early date to the Deanery of South Mailing, and was consequently a Peculiar of the see of Canterbury. The church, dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket, is supposed to have been built about 1260 by Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, on the site of an earlier building of a period not later than the Conquest. The condition of the parish in early times was that of a forest, and a large common is still called Barnet Wood. It contained timber in the last century ; and the original church was probably a wooden one. \" The plan is somewhat cruciform, including nave, chancel, north and south chantries, north and south aisles, north porch, and for merly a tower, which unfortunately fell, and has never been rebuilt.\" This happened in 1667. The principal inhabitants, the Stones, Durrants, aud Peckhams, are said to have been Dis senters, and therefore no attempt was made to rebuild the tower. Many of the ancient features are Early English. The aisles are of the Perpendicular period. There is a hagioscope opening from each chantry to the chancel. This church has suffered much dilapidation from tower to chancel, and compara tively little remains of its ancient beauty. The origin of the chantries is unknown. That on the north side belongs to the Hempstead estate, and was probably built by a family named De Hempstead, temp. Edward I. In that reign Archbishop Peckham granted a charter to Robert de Hempstead, elevating him from the condition of a villein to that of a freeman. The south chantry appears to have been founded by the Gages of Bentley Park, and is of the Early Tudor period. It contains a mural brass to the memory of Edward Gage, Esq., 1595, with figures of himself, his wife, and eight children. The fallen tower contained six bells, some of which were broken, though two of them are said to survive in the towers of East Grinstead and Rotherfield. There are memorials to the names and fami lies of Warnett, Woodward, Stone, Durrant, Peckham, Smith, Wharton, and others. There was living at Framfield, in 1851, a woman in humble life, aged 94, named Isabella Paris, nee Wharton, a connection of a vicar of the parish, who was"], [236, "190 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. descended from the Barons Wharton, of Wharton Castle, in Westmorland.

Sir Henry Thompson, Bart., of Oriel College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1544. Acreage, 8,745. Chief Landowners, Tbe Earl of Abergavenny, and the Marquis Camden. Seats, Eridge Castle ; Shernfold Park, the Hon. Percy Ashburnham ; Saxonbury Lodge, W. Davidson, Esq., &c, &c. This fine parish lies on the forest-ridge, and possesses great picturesque beauty. Its name appears to be connected with the Anglo-Saxon word Fernet, a wilderness or desert, which no doubt was its condition in early times. The village is roman tically seated on an eminence, and the whole parish consists of the bold undulations which characterize this district. The parish is watered by the Tyse and other tributaries of the Med way. A very small portion of it lies in Kent. Frant was carved out of the great parish of Rotherfield, and was originally a chapelry only. In this parish is a farm called Ramslye, anciently manorial, which I consider identical with the Rameslie of Domesday, respecting which much speculation has existed. This manor is described in the record as lying in the hundred of Ghestlinges, which I do not think is identical with the modern Guestling. In 792, Bertoaldus, a Saxon Dux or general, granted to the Abbey of St. Denis in France, the manor of Rotherfield (Ridrefelda) with the towns of Hastings and Pevensey, and"], [237, "191 FRANT founded the church of Rotherfield. Now as Ramslye was then parcel of Rotherfield, it seems probable that although the towns alluded to are very remote from it, they were considered part of the lordship thus conferred. We have numerous instances everywhere of ancient manors being thus disjointed. In very early times a park existed here. Domesday says \"Parcus est ibi.\" This was in aU probability Eridge Park, which Mr. Shirley, in his \" Deer Parks,\" considers the oldest recorded enclosure of this kind in England. In like manner the convent of monks established on their Sussex possessions, by the brethren of St. Denis, at Rotherfield, probably means that portion of the parish now called Frant. Of this establishment, its site, and the time of its abandonment, nothing appears to be known. The manor, which is a subinfeudation of the lordship of Rother field, was held, 29 Edward I., by William de Brownshend, from whom it passed in succession to Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, and to the family of De Bromfield. Temp. Philip and Mary, William Waller of Groombridge was lord, and sub sequently through many changes, included the names of Hendley, Frecheville, Baker, Hony wood,\" Dyke, Hutton, &c. It now vests in the Marquis Camden. Eeidge has been the property of the noble family of Neville for upwards of 500 years. It includes the ancient deer park, which is widely renowned for its wild, picturesque beauty. Aaron Hill thus describes it in the early part of the 18th century : \u2014 \" There is a place called Eridge Park, belonging to Lord Aber gavenny, and an open, old, appropriate forest, of the name of Waterdowne, that butted on the park enclosure. There was also then near it a house called Eridge House. The park was an assemblage of all nature's beauties \u2014 hills, vales, brooks, lawns, groves, thickets, rocks, waterfalls, all mildly noble and irregularly amiable.''' At present the green rides, cut through the woods in all directions, are said to exceed 70 miles in length. Saxonbury Hill, on the west side of the park, is crowned by an ancient circular entrenchment, in the centre of which stands a pros pect tower, the views from which are magnificent. The man sion called Eridge Castle and all the cottages around it are of modern erection. The former occupies the site of old Eridge House, and, though internally elegant, the exterior may be described as \" a pretty castellated toy.\" The towers and battle ments belong to the present century, and are profusely em bellished with the heraldric insignia of the illustrious family of Neville. The present noble proprietor resides principally at Birling in Kent, but makes Eridge an occasional abode. In 1578 Queen Elizabeth passed six days at Eridge. Lord Burleigh writes, \" From Eridge, my Lord of Burgeny's house, the Queen's"], [238, "192 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Majesty had a hard begyning of a progress in the Weald of Kent, and namely in some part of Sussex, where surely are more wondeross rocks and vadeys and much worss ground than in the Peek.\" For an account of the great baronial family, so long in possession, see Rowland's \" Family of Neville \" and Drummond's \"Noble Families.\" Eridge Green is a pretty hamlet of Frant. Riverhall is partly in this parish and partly in Wadhurst, and belonged, until the beginning of the last century, to the family of Fowle, who also built Lightlands, once the principal mansion in the parish, but now a farm-house. The Fowles were great iron-masters, and carried on some of their works in this parish. Shernfold Place, a fine mansion, built during the present cen tury by Charles Pigou, Esq., is a conspicuous feature in the landscape, and commands fine views on all sides. Saxonbury Lodge was built by Daniel Rowland, Esq., high sheriff in 1824, in a kind of medieval style, with battlements, &c. There are several other fine residences. Batham Abbey, partly in Frant, is described in a separate article, as is also Ttjnbeidge Wells, which see. The church is beautifully situated on an eminence ; its sum mit commands views of Beachy Head, of Dungeness, and occa sionally of Dover. The old church has been replaced by a new edifice. It consisted of nave and chancel, with north aisle and west tower ; but being found in a ruinous condition it was pulled down and rebuilt, and opened in 1822. Its architecture is non descript, but as good as could be expected for its date. It was principal ly erected at the expense of the Neville family, the Marquis Camden adding a south aisle. There are no ancient monuments, but there are tablets and inscriptions commemorative of Dyke (of Newhouse in the 17th century), Fowle, Weller, Delves, and Rowland. The number of bells is six. At Eridge Green is a district church, built in 1852, at the expense of the Earl of Abergavenny. The perpetual curacy of Holy Trinity is valued at \u00a3150, and is held by the Rev. Daniel Winham, M.A., of Christ College, Cambridge. [S. A. C. Ironworks, ii, 210. iii, 241. xviii, 16. Bayham Abbey, v, 156. vii, 217. ix, 145. xi, 121. xvi, 272. xviii, 44.

After them the Medleys had the estate, which passed as Buxted until its alienation by the re presentatives ofthe late Earl of Liverpool to \u2014 Lees, Esq. The Duke of Devonshire is now proprietor. Friston or Bechyngton Place, now a farm-house in a deep dell, relieved with ancient elms, has features of antiquity, including a hall, the roof of which be longs to the 14th century, though a ceiling of later date conceals the timbers from view. The building was much modified in the 1 7th century by the Selwyns. On a wooden screen at the end there is a painting of a drum, but with no legend attached. In the great window is a sun-dial in painted glass, with the motto Sensim sine sensu. Contiguous to the mansion is a well-house, in which the water is drawn from a great depth by donkeys or ponies within a revolving wheel. The church and a neighbouring windmill are conspicuous landmarks. The church is a small building of nave, chancel, and dovecote steeple. A small north transept was added some years since by Miss Gilbert, daughter ofthe late Davies Gilbert, Esq. There are several interesting memorials of the Selwyns, beginning with a miniature brass for CfjOlltaS and iffilargctg _Jf ItOglt, 1539. In the chancel are two handsome monuments for Thomas Selwyn and his family, 1613, and for Sir Edward Selwyn, 1704, whose son, William Thomas Selwyn, 1704, \u00e6t. 20, is de scribed as \" Ultimus Selwynorum,\" \" for whom the very marble might weep.\" There are also slabs for the Wdlards of Crow link.

Of its subsequent de scent, there appears little account. The village lies at the foot of the South Downs, and consists of a farm-house and a few shops and cottages. FUNTINGTON.

P. de Bathe, Bart. This parish lies bordering on the Downs, and consists chiefly of arable land, though there are portions of pasture, woodland, and common. For the salubrity of its air, Dallaway remarks that it may be called \" the Montpellier of England.\" There is no mention of it in Domesday, as it was included in the paramount lordship of Bosham. The hamlets of East and West Ashling are in this parish. Sennicots is a chapelry, value \u00a350, in the gift of Christopher Teesdale, Esq., and held by the Rev. Charles Buckner, B.D. The elegant mansions of Sennicots and Oakwood are in this parish, and there are many other excellent houses. A high earthwork, which is continued from the Camp at the Broyle, traverses the woodlands, in a direction for the rivulet at Ashling. The most probable conjecture is that it was a causeway made to procure water for the Roman army during their summer encampment. The church (Our Lady) was anciently appropriated to the College of Bosham, and the corpus of a prebend here belonged to that establishment. It has, in modern times, been endowed from various sources. The church (according to Horsfield*) consists of a chancel, nave, aisles, and embattled tower. It is described as being of \" the later style of English architecture.\" There are a few inscriptions, commemorating Smyth of Dens worth, Jackson, White, D'Oyley, Woods, Serle, &c.

W. de St. Croix, the incum bent, in vol. xx. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" and it may be considered a model of its kind for accurate description, historical research, and beautiful pictorial idustration. Glynde is probably the Celtic glind, a valley, which answers to its situation between the two South Down eminences called the Caburn and Firle Beacon. For some distance on the south and south-east sides it is bounded by a tributary of the Ouse, called Glynde Ritch. The Caburn itself is in this parish. It is pretty clearly Caerbryn, \" the fortified hill.\" In shape it resembles a depressed cone, and on the side, overlooking the valley of the Ouse, nothing has been done to strengthen it ; but on the north side there are a double vaUum and a fosse of great strength. Its ground plan is o2"], [242, "196 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. nearly circular, and about a quarter of a mile in circuit. It belongs to the same class of \" high places \" as Cissbury, Chanc tonbury, &c, on the South Downs, whose origin is involved in obscurity. Some have considered these hill forts Druidical, but another notion seems to be that they were simple military defences. The downs hereabouts, besides being very much spotted with tumuli, some of which have been explored, are marked with many quadrangular entrenchments, which Mr. de St. Croix thinks had no connection with the design of Caburn. In a valley to the west of Caburn, called Ox-steddle Bottom, is a small vallated work, much resembling an open book, and thence popularly known as \"the Devil's Bible.\" Traces of a Roman road, probably passing from Pevensey (Anderida) to Lewes, are found across the level at the foot of the village. The old windmill occupied the site of a tumulus called \" Gill's grave,\" and there have been found in the vicinity many graves with skeletons, as also several implements of iron, probably knives. Glynde is not mentioned in Domesday, but it may have been included in the manor of Mellinges, now Mailing, of which Archbishop Lanfranc was then lord. This supposition is strengthened by the fact that the advowson was a Peculiar of the Archbishops, and that the greater portion of the parish was feudally dependent on the archiepiscopal manor. Glynde be longed at an early date to a family who borrowed their name from it. Early in the 14th century Dyonysia, heiress of the Lord Glynde, married Sir Richard Walleys. His descendants, who were all of knightly degree, continued here for five genera tions. Towards the end of the 15th century, Joane, second daughter and co-heiress of the last Sir John Walleys, conveyed Glynde to Nicholas Morley, Esq., of the ancient family of that name in Lancashire. His son, Thomas Morley, by his will dated 1513, directs the foundation of a chantry in Glynde church. Fifth in descent from him was Col. Harbert Morley, who represented Lewes, temp. Charles I. and Cromwell. His son William mar ried Elizabeth, daughter of \u2014 Clarke, who, after his death, without issue, re-married John Trevor, eldest son of Sir John Trevor, Secretary of State to Charles II. ; and thus Glynde passed to his family, and so continued down to the time of Charles Trevor-Roper, Lord Dacre, who, dying without issue, the estate passed to his sister, Gertrude Trevor, who died in 1819, having married Thomas Brand, of the Hoo, co. Herts, Esq. Their third son, Henry-Otway Brand, assumed the name and arms of Trevor, by the will of the last Lord Hampden, who succeeded his eldest brother as 21st Lord Dacre. He was father of the present Lord Dacre, and of the Right Honourable Henry"], [243, "197 GLYNDE. Brand, long M.P. for Lewes, and late Secretary ofthe Treasury, now possessor of the estate and heir presumptive to the ancient barony of Dacre. Sir John Trevor, Secretary of State, before named, married Ruth, daughter of John Hampden, the Patriot, whose son Thomas, 1st Lord Trevor, Lord Privy-seal, had two sons, Robert, eventually 4th Lord Trevor, and Richard, Bishop of Durham, builder of Glynde church, who died S.P., in 1771. Robert, Lord Trevor, assumed the name of Hampden, and was created Viscount Hampden. He died in 1783. After his death he was succeeded first by Thomas Trevor, second Viscount, at whose death John Trevor Hampden, his brother, third Viscount, succeeded. Both these peers died in 1824, when, as before mentioned, Henry-Otway Brand afterwards succeeded to the Glynde and other Sussex estates. Glyndebourne was apparently a portion of the original Glynde estate, untd dismembered from it on the marriage of Mary, sister of Harbert Morley, temp. Elizabeth, to John Hay, Esq., of Hurst-Monceux, descended from the great Norman famdy of De Haia. The Hays were, like their kinsmen at Glynde Place, remarkable for political activity, and represented the County, Rye, Lewes, and Seaford for nearly a century and a half. The most noteworthy of the family is William Hay, M.P., author of \" Religio Philosophi,\" \"An Essay on Deformity,\" \"Mount Caburn,\" &c. ; he died in 1755. On the death of his youngest child, Francis Hay, in 1803, the Rev. Francis Tutte succeeded his sister at Glyndebourne ; but on his decease, with out issue, in 1824, it passed to James Hay Langham, Esq. (afterwards Baronet), in virtue of his descent from Sarah, daughter of Harbert Hay, who died, seised of Glyndebourne, in 1652. On Sir James coming into possession of Cottesbroke, this estate, according to the wills of the Misses Hay, passed to the father of the present possessor, William Langham Christie, Esq. The domain of Glyndebourne is very agreeable, and the house retains some vestiges of considerable age. Glynde Place probably stands on the site of the older resi dence of the Lords Glynde, and of Walleys, and the earlier Morleys. The present house was erected by William Morley, whose initials ancl the date, 1569, appear over a gateway of the quadrangle. The building was modernized by the Bishop oi Durham about 1750. It contains some fine pictures, and many family portraits. Mr. Brand also possesses a sketch of his illustrious ancestor, John Hampden. The village stands on an acclivity rising from the river towards the church, and contains some antique houses. The church,* built on the site of the older edifice by the * The advowson belonged to the Abbey of Bee, in Normandy, and at the dissolu tion of the alien priories, was conveyed to the Church of St. Georg. at Windsor."], [244, "198 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Bishop of Durham, in 1763, does not come up to modern ideas of church architecture, being of a semi-classical character. Were it not a church, it might be deemed a pretty structure, and its good site, trees, and other surroundings, render it a pleasing object. The \" communion window \" is filled with painted glass of the 16th century, and of foreign workmanship. The subjects are mostly scriptural. The mortuary inscriptions re cord the names of Morley, Trevor, Hampden, Hay, Rose, &c, and are very interesting. The roof turret has one bell. The late Mr. John Ellman gave an interest to this parish from his skill in the improvement of the breed of South Down sheep. He was long the tenant of Glynde farm, and died in 1832.

Domesday, Garinges ; a parish in the Hundred of Poling ; Bape of Arundel ; distant, three miles west from Worthing, its Post-town. It has a Bailway station on the South Coast Line. Union, East Preston. Population in 1811,439 ; in 1861, 535. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at \u00a3164, in the gift of David Lyon, Esq. ; Incumbent, Bev. Francis Caleb Scott, M. A., St. John's College, Oxford. Acreage, 2,182. Chief Landowner, D. Lyon, Esq., of Goring Hall. Seats, Castle Goring, Lady Pechell ; Highdown, Major William Lyon. The geographical form of this parish is oblong. The soil is fertde, and mostly in cultivation, and, what is rare on this part of the Sussex coast, its northern portion abounds in wood land. Four manors of Garinges, which Cartwright thinks in cluded East Ferring and East Preston, are mentioned in Domes day : 1. One containing a berewica (village) with twenty vdleins and twelve cottars ; 2. had been held of the Confessor by God win, father of Harold, and was worth 100s., and had thirteen villeins and eight cottars ; 3. was held of King Edward by Gon drede, and had two videins only ; 4. was held, temp. Confessor, at"], [245, "199 GORING. eight hides, and had six villeins and three cottars. Its value was 20s. At the time ofthe Survey, part ofthe manors 2, 3, and 4, were in the Rape of Widiam de Braose (i.e. Bramber). These seem to have become consolidated. De Albini, Earl of Arun del, was the paramount lord, and the land was adotted to Roger de Monte Alto, of whom Hugh le Bigot held six knights' fees, which probably extended beyond the boundaries of the present Goring. Next came the family of De Goring, denominated from the place, long and still one of the most influential houses in Sussex, at Burton, Highden, Danny, Wiston, &c. The heiress of the elder line married Henry Tregoz, of the baronial family of that name, and thus became owner of Goring. This family, of Cornish extraction, were influential in Sussex from the time of Henry IL, and so continued till towards the end of the fifteenth century. Some humble descendants, chiefly of the labouring class, called Treagus, are still found in the western division of the county \u2014 so persistently do names cling to our Sussex soil ! From the house of Tregoz, Goring passed through the D'Oyleys to the Lewknors. Sir John Lewknor was slain at Tewkesbury, and the manor escheated to the Crown. Restitution, however, was made in 1464, and the Lewknors remained lords until the reign of Elizabeth, when, by purchase, a branch of the Gorings re-acquired their ancestral estate. Sir William Goring aliened it about 1720 to Nicholas Turner, who resold it to William Westbrooke, Esq., from whom it passed to the family of Richard son. It now belongs to David Lyon, Esq. Field Place, in this parish, belonged from temp. Henry VII. to 1726 to the Cooke family, after which it was transferred to the Westbrookes. Upon an elevated site in the north part of the parish, the late Sir Bysshe Shelley erected, early in this century, a mansion on a singular plan. It is a large and commodious house, or rather a combination of two houses, the north front being in the cas tellated Gothic \" of the period,\" and the south in the Padadian style. The scenery commands views of the English Channel, the Downs, and rich woodlands. Highdown hill, a commanding elevation of the South Downs, is crowned by an irregular earth work of Celtic date. Within it is \" the Miller's Tomb,\" a flat stone raised on brickwork, with carved figures of Time and Death, and some queer verses, composed by the miller himself, who erected his tomb thirty years before his death, and during that period kept a ready-made coffin under his bed. This eccen tric individual was John Odiver, who, in spite of his high moral tone, is said to have been a fautor of the smuggling trade. At his funeral in 1793 he was carried round the field by persons dressed in white, and attended by a number of young women in white muslin, one of whom read a sermon over his grave !"], [246, "200 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The benefice belonged first to St. Nicholas of Arundel, a cell to the abbey of Seez, in Normandy, and was transferred to the College of the Holy Trinity, founded at Arundel in 1380. The church (Our Lady) was rebuilt in 1838, but the capitals, &c, from the old Transition-Norman church have been preserved. A tradition is extant that a religious house formerly existed near it. There are some remains of a wall at the south-east corner of the churchyard, and numerous foundations may be traced in an adjoining field. Hussey thinks, however, that these remains indicate a mansion \u2014 perhaps the abode of the ancient lords of the manor. The church tower had massive buttresses. There are three modern bells. Among the memorials of the dead are an altar-tomb with brasses to 3fof)n \u0152ofcc, and Emme his wife, Daniel Hales, 1600 ; and the names of Cooke, Fry, Whitehead, Stringer, Forman, Gittens, and Henty are among the later inscriptions.

This parish lies partly on the northern slope of the South Downs. The village is near the Downs, the acclivities of which are here pleasantly diversified with underwood and shrubs. Domesday Book states that four foreigners held the manor of the Earl (Roger de Mon tgomeri). These were Ralph, Robert, Rolland, and Ernald. Previously to the Conquest six thanes had held it by allodial tenure. As its extent was only ten hides, it is somewhat remarkable that six thanes should have held it. Of the intermediate descent of the manor little appears to be known ; but in 1589 John Lord Lumley sold it to the Garten family, from whom it passed by marriages through the families of Orme and Sargent to the present possessor, the Right Rev."], [247, "201 GREATHAMMM.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1632. Acreage, 769. This arable parish lies on the east bank of the Arun, and has a bridge over that river, originady built by Sir Henry Tregoz, temp. Edward II. The habitations of the small population are scattered and mean. The Domesday account of the manor is obscure, as two Great hams are mentioned, and it is difficult to ascertain to which the record applies. It appears, however, most probable that this is the one which in Saxon times was in the Hundred of Iswiridi (Easewrith?). It was held under the Confessor by the great pro prietor Azor, and after the Conquest byErnucion of Earl Roger de Montgomeri. It was rated at five hides, one of which was in the Rape of Bramber, and had a mid and four fisheries. The famdy of Tregoz held it at a later date, temp. Edward IL, under the Fitz-Alans. About 1365 the family of Mdle, at Mulne, or Milne, of Pulborough, were lords, and the manor descended through a co-heiress, in 1729, to the family of Williams, who subsequently assumed the name of Freeman. The remains of the ancient manor house of the Mdles are now a farm-house, much modernized with stucco. It stands on a somewhat preci pitous bank above the vadey of the Arun, and near the bridge. In 1827, when an extension ofthe bridge was carried out, some cannon balls were found, which Mr. Turner supposes to have been fired by Sir William Wader's troops as they were on their march towaivs Arundel during the Civil Wars, 1643, the then"], [248, "202 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. owner of Greatham, Thomas Mille, being a major in the Royalist army. The church is a small and very unpretending structure, with Early English features. It has two bells. Attached to the manor was the right of keeping swans on the Arun, or as it was called the High Stream. Every heir of the Mille family, on taking possession of the estate, paid the water-bailiff 6s. 8d. for renewing the family swan-mark. Several antique fictile vessels have been found in this parish, especially two which were dug up from a considerable depth, close to Greatham House, and were supposed to have contained mead or metheglin.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1686. Acreage, 3,564. Seat, Bromham, Sir Anchitel Ashburnham, Bart. The manor is a subinfeudation of Crowhurst. Before the Conquest, Ulbald held it of the Confessor ; afterwards Geoffrey de Flocer, of the Earl of Eu. Domesday speaks of it as having been \" devastated\"\u2014 doubtless by William's invading army. Temp. Henry III. it belonged to Henry de Ore, and subse quently to Gurney, Orlaston, Halle, Brown, Fitton, and Sack ville. The last had it from 8th Elizabeth till the beginning of the 18th century, when it was annexed, by purchase, to the Bromham estate. Guestling is a picturesque and pleasantly situated village, in cluding, besides the principal mansion of Bromham, several de tached villas and residences. Bromham belonged in 34th Henry VI. to Sir John de Stoneling, whose heiress married, temp. Henry VI., Richard, second son of Thomas Ashburnham of Ashburnham. His descendant. Sir Denny Ashburnham, was created a baronet at the Restoration of Charles II. Sir William, fourth baronet, was Bishop of Chiehester from 1754 to 1797, and died at the"], [249, "203 GULDEFOED. age of 88. His descendant, the present baronet, is possessor of Bromham. Thus the elder line and the second branch of the venerable family of Ashburnham have been living in close prox imity for the long period of four centuries. Bromham is a hand some house with a richly wooded park. The church, dedicated to St. Andrew (or St. Lawrence) is chiefly Early English, with some Norman features. It consists of a nave, with aisles, a chancel, and a low tower with a short spire. Its single bell is ancient, and inscribed to St. Katherine. On the south side of the chancel are two sedilia. There are monuments for the Ashburnhams, 1597, and Cheneys, 1603. Bishop Ashburnham also lies buried here. At Maxfield, in this parish, was born, temp. Henry VIII., Gregory Martin, a Romanist controversial writer of great learn ing and ability. He died at Rheims in 1582. (\" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 240.) The Rev. Robert Bradshaw, rector, who died in 1736, left a provision for the education of the poor, and \u00a320 a year for medical attendance in the parishes of Guestling, Pett, and Fairlight.

A much older one existed formerly, but one Thomas Hooper, Bector of Beckley, is said to have removed it during a parochial squabble, and never to have returned it. (Horsfield.) Acreage, 2,430. This is the easternmost parish in the county, and the prefix is more likely to denote that fact than to imply a contradistinc tion to the chief town of Surrey. It hes entirely in Romney Marsh, and is in a high degree fertile. There is no manor, but a fee farm rent of 100 marks is payable to the Earl of Winchel sea (Horsfield). Unless recently \" restored,\" the church (St. Mary) is an ecclesiological curiosity. It consisted of a nave only, with a double roof, supported internally by a row of wooden pillars.

They intermarried with the La Warrs, Gages, Brownes, Shelleys, and other great Sussex houses. The last of the family was Robert Guldeford, of Hempstead, created a baronet by James II. [S. A. C. Guldeford of Hempstead, xv, 138. Bell, xvi, 210.] HADLOW DOWN. A hamlet in the parish of Mayfield, about four miles south west of the town. In consequence of its distance from the parish church an ecclesiastical district was formed from this parish and those of Framfield and Buxted. The benefice is a perpetual curacy, alternately in the gift of the incumbents of the parishes of Mayfield and Buxted. It is now held by the Rev. Reginald Rivers Kirby, B.A., of St. John's College, Cam bridge. Hadlow House was for many generations the property of the old Sussex family of Day, collateral descendants of Bishop Day, of Chiehester, and now represented by W. Ansell Day, Esq. The church, which is a neat structure, was consecrated in 1836, and is dedicated to St. Mark. HAILSHAM. Domesday, Hamelesham ; vulgo, Helsom ; a jsarish and market town in the Hundred of Dill ; Bape of Pevensey ; distant about seven miles north from Eastbourne ; Post-town, Hawkhurst.

The manors extending into Hailsham are Downash, Willingdon, Otham, and Michelham. Hamelsham was held, temp. Domesday, by William, of the Earl of Moreton. Its subsequent history is obscure ; but in 36 Henry III. Peter of Savoy obtained for it a market, which is still held for cattle and corn on alternate Wednesdays, and is a considerable emporium for the district. Mr. Burfield has here a manufactory of twine and sacking, which employs a large number of persons. The town is small, and does not re quire particular description. In the square area where the three streets meet, there formerly stood a market-cross. During the French war extensive barracks were erected near this town. Part of the parish lies within the liberty of the corporation of Pevensey, and is called Otham quarter. Here stood, in ancient times, the Abbey of Otteham, afterwards removed to Bayham. See Otham. The church (St. Mary), which was anciently a chapel to Hel lingly, is a large and rather commanding building, consisting of western tower with crocketed pinnacles, nave with north and south aisles, and high chancel with north and south chancels of unequal lengths. In the central chancel are a broad sedile and a piscina. There are also piscinae in both the others, but as to the history of these minor chancels, or chantries, nothing seems to be known. Perhaps one of them may have been founded by the knightly family of De Halsham, two of whom, John de Halsham (who married one of the co-heiresses of David Stiabolgy, Earl of Athol, in the 14th century) and his grandson Sir Hugh, have fine brasses in West Grinstead church. The church is generally in the Decorated and Perpendicular styles, but it has been much patched. Very recently, however, restora tions and repairs have been made. There are memorials for Lux ford, Tumbrill, Willard, Miller, &c. In 1756 the Rev. N. Torriano, M.D., preached a sermon at Hooe and Ninfield on a fast day, after the earthquake of Lisbon, in which he states that \" the spire of Helsham steeple \" had lately been struck down by lightning ; but this is an error : it was the north-west pin nacle that was so injured. Strype mentions that in March, 1558, the church of Haylsham was spoiled by the inhabitants of the said town, for which they were brought to account by Sir Nicholas Pelham and Sir Edward Gage. Temp. Henry III. Gilbert de Aquila gave this church to the Priory of Michelham, but it was afterwards given to Bayham Abbey. [S. A. C. Marshall's gifts to, xiii, 52. De Flocers, of, xiii, 136.

Seats, Combe Place, and Hamsey House, Thomas Whitfeld, Esq. This parish lies partly on the ancient estuary of the Ouse, and partly on the elevated ridge of the South Downs. It is a picturesque parish, intersected by the ancient Ermin Street, a Roman via, which ran from what is now called Newhaven to London. The present highway is, I think, on the site of the original road, and commands a fine view of the Wealden scenery of the district. The original name of the parish was Hame or Hammes,* which signifies a waterish situation, justified by existing geogra phical characteristics. The final syllable is derived from the great Norman family of de Saye, who came from Sai, near Argentan, and afterwards became distinguished among our nobility, and are still represented by Lord Say and Sele. The first mention of Hamsey occurs in the year 925, when Athelstan held a gemote \" at Hame, by Lewes.\" At the date of Domes day Ralph held Hame of William de Wa.renne. The possessions, rated originally at 25 hides, were much scattered, portions lying in the rapes of Pevensey and Arundel. The value in the time of the Confessor was \u00a320, but at the date of the survey it was only half that sum. Among the possessions are mentioned a church, 13 ploughlands, 16 villeins, and 14 bondmen, 200 acres of meadow, and a wood of 10 hogs. Mr. Chapman, in an ex cellent article, \"The Parochial History of Hamsey,\" \"Sussex Arch. Coll.,\" vol. xvii., has given a full account of the succes sive lords of this place. The De Says, who, soon after the Conquest, built a Castle here upon a little peninsula formed by a sudden winding of the Ouse, but of which very slight traces remain, continued in possession till 1383, when John de Say left a sister and heiress Elizabeth, aged 16. She married first Sir John de Falvesley, who fought the French at the little battle of Rottingdean, and was there taken prisoner (see Rottingdean). He died without issue in 1392, and was buried at Lewes Priory. His widow re-married Sir William Heron, who also died without * I have heard aged people call the parish \" Hammes,\" without the suffix, which was appended in the same way as Pierpoint is now to Hurst. In most cases the suffix is dropped in our Sussex parishes, except in legal formulae."], [253, "207 HAMSEY. issue. Both the husbands of Elizabeth were summoned to Par liament as Barons. The next lord of Hamsey was Sir William de Clynton, son of John de Clynton and Idonea de Say, who was summoned to Parliament as Lord de Clynton and Saye, and died in 1432. His son John, who had a parliamentary summons from 1450 to 1460, was a conspicuous person in his time. He went into the war against France with Richard, Duke of York, and being taken prisoner the large sum of 6,000 marks was demanded for his ransom. Henry VI., in aid of his redemption, granted him a license to employ agents to buy 600 sacks of wool and 600 pieces of woollen cloth. He afterwards revolted against the king, joined the cause of Edward, came back with him to England, landed at Ravenspur, and died bravely fighting for him at the battle of Barnet, in 1471. He was succeeded by John, Lord Clinton and Saye, who, for \u00a3200, sold his manor of Hammes et Heynstrete (now a hamlet called Hewin Street) to Sir Henry Willoughby. In 1504, the family of Dudley possessed the manor, and from them it passed successively to the Lewk nors, Alfords, Wenhams, and other families, who were for the most part not resident here, and whose ownership throws very little interest into the history of the parish. Edmund Dudley, Esq., in 1508, conveyed to John Ashdown, Prior of Lewes, and Dame Agnes Morley, \u00a320 per annum, arising out of this manor, and the latter with the proceeds founded the free grammar school of Southover, since removed to the parish of St. Anne, in Lewes. A branch of the family of Bivers of Chafford, co. Kent, was seated at Coombe and Offham in this parish, in the 17th century. The principal house in Hamsey is Coombe, very agreeably situated at the base of the South Downs on a spot answerable to its name. The family of Bridger, formerly of Ashurst in West Sussex, settled here temp. Charles IL, and terminated in the male line with Sir John Bridger, who was knighted at the coronation of George III. His daughter and heiress married George Shiffner, Esq., created a baronet by George rv., in 1818. He was many years M.P. for Lewes, and was succeeded by his son, Admiral Sir Henry Shiffner, Bart., a sturdy sailor and a sound practical Christian. At his death the estate devolved on his brother, the Rev. Sir George Shiffner, whose son, the Rev. Sir George Shiffner, rector of Hamsey, now enjoys the estate. Sir George is descended, through female heirs, from Captain Nicholas Tattersal, who, after the battle of Worcester, conveyed Charles II. from Brighton to Fecamp, and he possesses at Coombe, among other rare and curious antiquities, a ring with miniatures of the King and Queen Catherine, which, according to tradition, was presented by the King to Tattersal."], [254, "208 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The original church of Hamsey occupies the high ground where the now deserted sacred edifice of the parish stands, near the site of the old castle of the De Sayes. A new church hav ing been built, chiefly at the expense of the Shiffner family, at Offham, the principal hamlet of the parish where the chief portion of the inhabitants reside, the ancient edifice has been retained as a kind of cemetery chapel. It is one of the most picturesque buildings in the district, and has architectural features ranging over all periods, from very early Norman to the Perpendicular, the grand and massive tower belonging to the last-mentioned style. In the chancel is an excedent example ofthe canopied altar tombs called Easter sepulchres, but it cannot be appropriated to any particular individual or family. It probably belongs to the time of Henry VII., and, as Mr. Chapman con jectures, to a Lewknor. There are inscriptions to the families and names of Rivers, Shore, Wenham, Bridger, Shiffner, Part ington, Cooper, Guy, &c. The grey ivy-mantled tower, viewed from various points, resembles a fortalice or castle. For Offham, see that article. [S. A. C. Saye family, xii, 42. xv, 162. xvii, 70.

This small South Down parish possesses two or three points of interest. The manor was held before the Conquest by Azor, and after it by WiUiam de Wateville. In 26 Edward I. Charles de Angleton and Ralph de Meyners held it of the honour of De"], [255, "HARDHAM. 209 Warenne. Subsequently it vested successively in the Poynings, Covert, Sidney, Bellingham, and Sackville families, and in the representatives of the last-named it still remains. The manor house, in a valley surrounded with tall trees, is an interesting structure, principally of the Elizabethan period, but with earlier features. From the initials R. B. formerly on a mantle-piece, it was probably rebuilt by Richard Bellingham, lord of the manor in 1594. The ceilings of two of the rooms are orna mented with the Bellingham armorials in parget work. Earlier tenants or proprietors were the Scrases, of whom Richard Scrase, Valet to the Crown, died in 1499. Almost close to the manor house is another residence called Benfield, now occupied by farm labourers. It was originally the estate of the family of De Benefeld, 18 Edward II. , and passed before the year 1503 to the Coverts of Slaugham. Over the porched entrance are many shields of arms of that family and their alliances. It is said to have been built by one of the Coverts as a hunting-seat. The church (St. Helen) is a singularly plain and bleakly situated budding, of nave, chancel, and embattled tower, open to the sh/. It was originally Norman, but Mr. Hussey thinks the much-patched remains are of Early English date. On the south wall of the chancel is a monument with figures of a hus band, wife, and nine children in the attitude of devotion. It is doubtless of the sixteenth century, but it has been sadly defaced, and no inscription remains. In the church-yard are several tombs for the family of Hardwick, hereditary tenants of Han gleton manor-house for many generations. In 1724 there were but five families in the parish, and they were mostly quakers. [S. A. C. \" My master Scrasse of H,\" ii, 322. Celts found at, viii, 268. Eoman coins, &c, ix, 124.

This small parish, now very unimportant among its sister villages, has traces of Celtic, Roman, and Medieval occupation of no inconsiderable interest. The name of it has strangely r"], [256, "210 HISTORY OF SUSSEX varied in orthography from Heriedha' to Herringham and Hardham. Godwin, a free tenant, held it in the time of the Confessor, and afterwards one Robert held it of the potent Earl Roger. It was rated at five hides, and there were ten villeins, four cottars, three fisheries, and a wood of three hogs. It was valued at 100s. In early Norman times it was possessed by John de Alta Ripa or Dawtry, who seems to have borrowed his name from the high stream of the Arun, \" ripa \" being under stood not as a bank, but as the river itself. The Dawtreys were of high importance in the district for many generations. Their heiress conveyed the estate by marriage to the family of St. John. From William de St. John, who died in 1438, it passed in succession through the names of Hussey, Goring, Turner, Pike, Bonham, and Carter. The Priory of Heriugham, now Hardham, is believed to have been founded temp. Henry II. by Sir William Dawtrey. It was a very small establishment for the order of Black Canons of St. Augustine. In the reign of Edward III. Sir William Paynell augmented and enlarged the foundation. At a later date the Gorings were benefactors, and had the patronage of the priory. At the Dissolution of the lesser monasteries, Sir William Gor ing, then a great court favourite, had a grant of the site and lands. The priory occupied a pleasant spot near the Arun, and some of the original buildings are yet traceable in and about the farm-house. The chapel appears to have been built in the latter part of the 13th century. The church (St. Botolph?) is of extremely smad dimensions, and contains traces of early architecture. At the east end of the nave is a curious bell-cote contain&ig two bells. In the churchyard there formerly stood a remarkable yew-tree, pro bably much older than the church. It was hollow, and in 1832 twenty-seven persons could stand within it. Its estimated sub stance, if solid, was 290 cubic feet ! In 1821 its top was blown off, and now the whole tree has disappeared. I asked the parish clerk why they had cut it down, and his answer was that \" it was nore out andforeolded.\" But the most interesting antiquities connected with Hardham are its Roman remains. The well-known Via called the Stane Street from Chiehester (Regnum) to London crossed the parish. Many relics of Roman date had been noticed here by the late Mr. Peter Martin, of Pulborough ; but in 1863 Mr. W. Boyd Dawkins, B.A., F.G.S., being employed on the geological survey, made further discoveries. The locality abounded in small Roman enclosures and camps, and Mr. Dawkins investigated these vestigia with much attention. In the construction of the Mid-Sussex railway, there was occasion to work a \"ballast-"], [257, "HARTFIELD. 211 hole,\" and several graves were brought to light. These con tained rude oaken coffins or rather boxes (without bottoms) with urns and other vessels, bones of animals, flint flakes, a sandal of leather, bronze fibul\u00e6, a coin of Hadrian, &c. The railway runs through a small Roman or Romano-British camp, with well defined outlines. Full particulars of this discovery are given by Mr. Dawkins in Vol. xvi. of the \" Sussex Collections.\" It may be added that a considerable part of the materials of Hardham church, built in Norman times, was derived from this or some other neighbouring station. The Arun and Wey canal passes close to the camp, and has a tunnel 400 yards long, perforated through a sand rock, at a cost it is said of \u00a36,000. [S. A. C. Pond-barrow, ix, 116.

There are several good residences in the parish, of which Ashdown Park is one. The name Hartfield implies the existence, in former times, of a preserve for deer, when the great forest of Ashdown abounded in \"vert and venison.\" The parish is, like most others in the Weald, oblong in shape, being nearly six miles in length, and averaging about two in breadth. The soil varies much in different parts; the surface is agreeably undulated, and there is wood land amounting to about 1,400 acres, besides waste and common. Beautiful views are attainable from Perry Hill, High-beeches, and Hody Hill. A branch of the Medway crosses the parish. The place called Castle-fields probably indi cates the site of some ancient defence. From Domesday Book it appears that one Walter held a hide in Hertevel of the Earl of Moreton. Before the Conquest Carl held it as freehold. There were one plough land and a half in the demesne, and six vdleins, and two servi had the same p 2"], [258, "212 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. quantity. There were a mill of 4s., a rent of 350 eels, and a wood of five hogs. The manor of Bolebrooke, belonged, temp. Edward I., to the family of De laLynde, whose ultimate heiress carried it to that of Dalingruge, ancestors of the founder of Bodiam Castle. Temp. Richard II. the heiress of this family conveyed it by marriage to the Sackvilles, ancestors of the Earls and Dukes of Dorset and with their descendants it still remains. There was, however, an interval during which it was the property of the Tuftons, Earls of Thanet, from temp. James I. till 1770, when it was repurchased by the Sackvilles. The ancient mansion of Bolebrook, formerly the residence of the Sackvilles, was one of the oldest brick buildings in Sussex, dating from about the middle of the fifteenth century. A small portion of it, comprising the entrance gateway, flanked by two towers, remains. Some parts of the foundations are traceable. A park and demesne were formerly attached to this ancient abode. The church (St. Mary) has a \" chancel, nave, south aisle, of which the chancel reaches about half way up the other, south porch, and west tower with shingled spire.\" (Hussey.) The building has Early English and Decorated features. There are two piscin\u00e6 and a stoup. The entrance to the churchyard is by a lych-gate, under an old cottage. There are inscriptions to the names of Davis, Slade, Swiney, Maitland, Rands, &c, and there are several iron slabs, and some ancient stones, from which brasses have been torn off by sacrilegious hands. The more modern memorials commemorate, among others, the Henniker and Jowett families, and there is a handsome tablet erected by the present rector for the Rev. Henry Polehampton, chaplain to the garrison at Lucknow, where he was lulled during the siege of 1857. The church has been restored, and a handsome organ which cost \u00a3200 has been presented by C.

Henry Doddridge Gordon, M.A., of New College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1567. Acreage, 7,832. Chief Landowner, Lady Featherstonhaugh, of Up-Park. This large and very interesting parish lies partly on the beautiful undulations of the South Downs, and consists, as to surface, of arable, down, and woodland, of which the last two preponderate. The soil varies from pure chalk to a rich clay, and thence to ferruginous sand, covered with heath and fern. The village, or town, lies under the northern escarp- ment of the South Downs, and is, with its vicinity, full of picturesque beauty. From Domesday it appears to have been held of Edward, by the Countess Gida, and was then assessed at 80 hides ; but on its transfer, after the Conquest, to Roger Earl of Montgomeri, it was rated at 47 only. The assessment was 63 plough lands, 30 acres of meadow, and a wood of 100 hogs. There were 20 servi and nine mills. Under the Confessor the value was \u00a380, but under the Conqueror \u00a3100, which proves it to have been one of the largest manors in the county. Under the name of Hamesford it was the paramount manor cf Dump- ford, included with Easebourne. The oldest family connected with Harting was that of Hosatus, De Hoese, Husee, or Hussey. In the reign of Henry II. Henry Husee founded here a hospital for lepers, which was afterwards subject to Dureford Abbey, which had been founded in 1163 by Henry de Hoese. Matthew Husee held four knights' fees in Harting and Chithurst. In 1266 King Henry III. gave license to Henry Husee to enclose, fortify, and crenellate, with a wall of stone and lime, his place at Harting. In 1349 a third-part of this mansion, with the chambers neaf the west gate, and certain rights as to the gar- dens, pigeon-houses, &c, was assigned to Katherine, widow of Henry Husee. The mention of a gate and a prison-house indi- cate the importance of the manorial abode of the Lords of Hart- ing. The original mansion or castle was succeeded by a house called Harting Place; but this has also succumbed to the hand of time. The Husees originated in Normandy, where La Hous- saie or holly-wood is a common topographical name. They came from a place a mile north of Rouen, which is now called \" le Houssel.\" Of this great family many detads are given by Mr. Blaauw in \" Sussex Collections,\" vol. viii. The parish, besides Harting proper, or South Harting, con tains the two hamlets of East and West Harting. I think there was also in old times a North Harting, now included in the parish of Rogate, whence \" Harting Combe.\" Ladyholt Park, close to the boundary of Hampshire, was the ancient abode of the Carylls, who had the principal estates in Harting,"], [260, "214 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. and were of great local importance. They were adherents of the Stuart family, in whose cause they were great sufferers. They removed from Ladyholt to West Grinstead. (See that parish.) West Harting stands upon an eminence, and has to wards the north a fine sheet of water. Of the moated mansion of Sir Anthony Windsor here, there are no existing remains. It was probably of the 15th century. Up-Park, in East Harting, was long the residence of the ancient family of Ford. Sir Edward Ford defended Arundel Castle, of which he was governor, against Sir William Waller, in 1642. He was distinguished for his philosophical and mechanical attainments. His daughter and heiress, Catherine, married Ralph, Baron Grey of Werke, who died here in 1675, leaving a son, Ford, Baron Grey, created Earl Tankervdle in 1695. This nobleman pulled down the old house, and built the present fine mansion. His heiress, Mary Grey, married Charles Bennett, Baron Ossulston, who was also created Earl of Tankervdle in 1714. His son, Charles, Earl of Tankervdle, sold Harting in 1746 to Sir Matthew Featherston haugh, Bart., for \u00a319,000 \u2014 the timber on the estate being worth the whole money. It is now the property and residence of Lady Featherstonhaugh, relict of the late baronet. The situation of the house is most delightful, commanding extensive land and sea views. The park is large and well wooded, particularly with beech trees, whose great clumps overshadow the deep ferny hollows. The house is full of interesting objects \u2014 pictures, carvings, &c, the most notable being a collection of Sevres china, bought upwards of half a century since by the late Sir Harry Featherstonhaugh for \u00a320,000, and now estimated to be worth \u00a3100,000 ! Ditcham, a hamlet, partly in Harting, and partly in the parish of Buriton, in Hampshire, belonged to a branch of the family of Cowper from temp. Edward VI. tdl 1762. Torbarrow, an isolated conical hill near South Harting, was probably a Celtic stronghold. The church (Our Lady and St. Gabriel) is a large and hand some building, contrasting favourably with the other churches of the district. It consists of a nave with aisles, north and south transepts, and a central tower, surmounted by a tapering spire covered with copper. The chancel arch is lofty and pointed, and has the dog-tooth ornament. There are six modern bells. The church, which has recently been repaired, chiefly at the cost of Lady Featherstonhaugh, contains many memorials for the families of Ford, Cooper, Coke of Ditcham, Postlethwaite, &c. In the south transept is a very singular monument with grotesque effigies of the 17th century. In the chancel is a fine marble monument by Westmacott for Sir H. Featherston haugh, Bart., of Up-Park, ob. 1846, cet. 92. On the south side"], [261, "215 HASTINGS. of the chancel there stood a sepulchral chapel for the Carylls, the roof of which has been removed, leaving exposed to the weather two recumbent effigies, male and female, without in scription or date, but beautifully executed, and probably of the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. To see these fine works of art thus crumbling to decay is enough to make the heart of every antiquary ache. Cardinal Richard Pole stands in the list of sinecure rectors of this parish. [S. A. C.

It is situated on the English Channel, and is in latitude 50\u00b0 34' north, and longi tude 0\u00b0 37' east. It is the head of a Poor Law Union, and a Parliamentary borough, returning two members to the Senate. Including the important suburbs of St. Leonards and Halton, it embraces an area of nearly 3,000 acres, and it has a sea frontage of about two miles, with an extent inland of 1^ mile. It con sists of several parishes, particulars of which will be given below. The history of this town has often been written. Horsfield's Sussex contains a fair account of it, and there have been separate monographs, such as Moss's \" Hastings,\" \" Hastings Past and Present,\" by a Lady (Miss Howard), as well as in numerable guide books, each good in its kind ; but Hastings yet awaits a comprehensive history. Lately (1867), Mr. T. Hoi well Cole, M.A., has published a small volume, which is the nearest approach to a fud and accurate notice that has appeared. Although like Seaford, Pevensey, and Winchelsea, Hastings has now no \" haven for ships,\" there is no reasonable doubt of its having formerly been a considerable port ; or how otherwise could it have become the head of that ancient league called the Cinque Ports \u2014 the English Hanse-Towns ? An old memorial verse runs thus : \u2014 \" Has\u2014 Dov,\u2014 Sea,\u2014 Hy,\u2014 Sand,\u2014 Riim,\u2014 Win,\u2014 Rye.\""], [262, "216 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. \u2014 meaning Hastings, Dover, Seaford, Hythe, Sandwich, Romney ,_ Winchelsea, and Rye. In spite of opposing claims on behalf of Dover and Romney, we must authoritatively demand for Hast ings the headship of the Cinque Ports. Geological changes have rapidly taken place within the historical period, and the coast line of Sussex has been so much altered, that if some \" ancient mariner \" of the 10th or 11th century could lookup from his bed of dust he would not recognize the present domains of Thetis as those which he formerly knew. A \" sea-change \" of no ordinary magnitude has taken place ; but though at the present day Hastings cannot, as of yore, boast of her gallant navies, she can fairly claim to be one of the most favourite and popular towns on our southern coast. Tbe annual loss of land hereabouts has been estimated, according to Mr. Cole, at seven feet per annum, though of course sea-defences have of late years kept old Neptune within proper limits, and the proud waves have been stayed by human art. Of the prehistoric condition of Hastings nothing satisfactory is known. It is probable that the lines of earthworks on the East Hill are Celtic, though afterwards, as usual, adapted to Roman uses. That the Romans were well acquainted with the locality has been proved by various discoveries, especially those of Mr. Thomas Ross, the local authority in matters of this nature. The earliest name on record applied to the place has the termination ceaster, a most obvious Saxon corruption of the Latin castrum, a camp or fortification, as seen in Winchester, Rochester, Manchester, and Chiehester. Hastingchester would be the correct designation of the town, as it was in the 11th century. Mr. Cole inclines to the belief that a Roman munici pality existed here, which is probable, and it is pretty certain that the Cinque Ports are only the comparatively modern repre sentatives of the district known in the lower empire as the Littus Saxonicum, or Saxon shore.* The origin of the name of Hastings simple is uncertain. Some have supposed that it is derived from the river Asten, which debouches at Bulverhythe, a little to the west of St. Leonards, the \" boding ominous brook \" of the Polyolbion. Others think Hastings, the well-known Viking Norseman, is its godfather, which is more probable. A third theory is that it was named after a tribe called the H\u00e6stingas, against whom Offa, King of Mereia, made war in 792. In 924 King Athelstan established a mint here, and pennies of Canute, Edward the Confessor, * Not, as has been supposed, because in tbe later period of Roman rule in Britain, this coast was exposed to the inroads of the Saxons ; but because a considerable colonization by tbe Teutonic race had taken place before the departure of the Romans from Britain. The Saxons in our island date much earlier than the time of Hengist."], [263, "217 HASTINGS. Harold, William I., William II. , and Henry I., are described by Ruding. The moneyers were Alfred, Dunning, and Bridd, possibly a progenitor of the existing family of Breeds. It is, as already intimated, a moot point whether Hastings has claim to priority over Dover as a Cinque Port ; but this is pretty well decided by the fact that this town in the 11th century furnished more than a third part of the entire naval force of England. The \" Saxon Chronicle \" informs us that in 1050 the men of Hastings and its neighbourhood, including probably Pevensey and Seaford, fought two of Godwin's ships, slew all the meu, and brought the vessels into Sandwich to the King. Some time previously, a.d. 792, Hastings, with Pevensey and Rotherfield, had been granted, by Beortald, or Bertwald, a Sussex dux or chieftain, to the Abbey of St. Denis, near Paris. The Confessor bestowed Rye, Winchelsea, and part of what is now Hastings upon the monks of Fecamp, in Normandy. The following extracts from the \" Saxon Chronicle \" relate to this ancient place : \u2014 1011. The Danes had overrun all Kent, and Sussex, and Hastings (H\u00e6stingas), and Surrey. 1050. A little before that the men of Hasstiuga-c\u00e6stre and thereabouts, fought two of Swein's ships with their ships. 1052. During that time the Godwine was in the land, he enticed to him all the men of Kent, and all the butsekarls (seamen) from H\u00e6stingan and everywhere there by the sea coast, and all the east end, and Sussex, and Surrey. 1006. And the while William, the Earl (Duke), landed at Hestingan. Mon. Hist. Btitannica. The last is the incident which will make this town memorable in s\u0153cula s\u00e6culorum \u2014 the Norman Invasion. It is true that Hastings had a small share only in that memorable event, for the landing took place at Pevensey, and the dire conflict which put an end to the Saxon dynasty occurred at what is now called Battle. Both these places are some miles distant from Hastings ; but, as this town was the principal place in the district, the fight which transferred the kingdom from Harold to Widiam will always be called the Battle of Hastings. That wonderful worsted record, the Bay-eux Tapestry, informs us that, \" Here Duke William, in a large ship, crossed the sea, and came to Pevensey.\" (Hie Willelm Dux, in magno navigio mare transivit, et venit ad Fevenes\u0153.) This shows the true landing place, where Wdliam grasped the sea-sand, and took seisin of England. The landing of a large number of ships must have occupied a con siderable length of coast, and as I have elsewhere said, some of the navigia may have been drawn ashore not far from Hastings. The forces, on landing, rushed onwards to Hastings to forage. (Et hie milites fiestinaverunt Ilastinga, ut cibum raperentur.) They got food, as the Tapestry shows, and the invaders dined to their"], [264, "218 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. hearts' content ; but the stone called the Conqueror's Table is a myth. A later scene informs us that here, at Hastings, Bishop Odo (of Bayeux, the Conqueror's half-brother) commanded a castle, or earthwork to be dug. (Odo eps. jussit ut fioderetur castellum at Hastenga Ceastra.) ' There is the representation of a fort, apparently of wood. Further on, two men are shewn setting fire to a house, from which a poor woman and her child are escaping. The next scene is the setting out for the battle field some days later. The events of that encounter belong to Hastings hi name only \u2014 for it was at Battle, seven or eight miles from Hastings, that the grandest fight which ever occurred in Britain took place. (See art. Battle, ante.) The castle, dug at Hastings, was a temporary entrenchment of earth for imme diate use. The heavy works, at the back of the ruins of the Castle, now existing, appear to be pre-Roman, like Caburn, Cissbury, Chanctonbury, and other Celtic hill forts running through the county. Besides, we are assured by the \" Chronicle\" of Battle Abbey that Wdliam's castle here was simply of wood (ligneum castellum munivit). The real camp of the Normans was, I believe, to the right of the road leading from the Priory meadows towards Bohemia, where embankments are clearly traceable. The wooden castle set up was simply one of the timber structures, which, as we are informed by the \" Chroni cle,\" William had brought with other armaments from Nor mandy. The Domesday account of Hastings is not very satisfactory. When the Saxon dux gave Hastings, Pevensey, and Rotherfield to the Abbey of St. Denis, near Paris, in the 8th century, most manors and lordships were very much scattered, the disjecta membra often being many miles apart. It was so in this case, for Rameslie, as mentioned in Domesday, was not, as has been erroneously supposed, the existing manor of Brede, near at hand, but a remote place in the ancient parish of Rotherfield (Frant) still known by that name. According to the statement of the Survey, the abbot of Fecamp held both of King Edward and of the Conqueror, Rameslie. It was rated for 20 hides under the earlier monarch, but only at 1 7^ under the latter. There were 36 ploughlands and 99 villeins, with 43 other ploughlands, together with five churches of 64 shillings ; 100 salt-pans, of \u00a38 15s. \u2014 probably the largest salt works then extant in the kingdom \u2014 seven acres of meadow, and a wood of two hogs. In this manor a new burgus had been established, where there were 64 burgesses paying \u00a37 18s. Four burgesses in Hastings and 14 bondmen yielded 63s. Robert de Hastings held 2\u00a3 hides of the Abbot, and Herolf half a hide. The whole manor was valued in the time of the Confessor at \u00a334 ; and, at the making of the"], [265, "219 HASTINGS. record, the abbot's possessions were valued at \u00a350. This is a very unintelligible statement. According to Mr. Cole's estimate, the manor was about 5,000 acres ; but we search in vain for such an area unless we go to the outlying territory at Rotherfield, now including, in the parish of Frant, a part or the whole of Eridge Park. Mr. Durrant Cooper seeks to identify the \" New Burgus \" with Winchelsea, and he is probably correct ; certainly, I see no reason for con cluding that any \" new town \" of that date sprang up on a different site from the old \" Hastings-Chester.\" The particulars of the Great Fight, known as the Battle of Hastings, are given in the article Battle, ante. The subsequent history of the Town is as well ascertained as that of any place in England. Mr. Cole's excellent monograph contains various hypothetical remarks relative to Hastings, and I must refer the reader who requires details to that work. In 1093, William Rufus was at Hastings for a month, and during that time Archbishop Anselm, with seven other bishops, assisted at the consecration of the Bishop of Lincoln, and in 1095 he made another visit on the occasion of the consecration of Battle Abbey. In the time of Richard I., the Priory of the Holy Trinity was founded by a knight of Norman descent, Sir Walter de Bricet (possibly from the ancient manoir now called Bricet near Avranches). The establishment was situated on what is the site of the railway station, on a low ground constantly exposed to the inundations of the sea. Eventually the monks were driven from their home by this cause in 1410, and estab lished themselves at a \" New Priory,\" some miles distant, in the parish of Warbleton, where Sir John Pelham, the feudal lord of the Barony and Rape of Hastings, gave them lands for a refuge. (See Warbleton.) Departing a little from the direct line of history, I may advert for a moment to the remarkable arms of Hastings, to shew in what estimation this \" ancient town and port \" was held in very early times. This subject has been mentioned in the \"Curiosities of Heraldry,\" and in my discourse on the Seals of the Cinque Ports in vol. i. of the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections.\" Without the technicalities of heraldry, the arms may be described as three half-lions conjoined with three half-ships ; the demi-lions representing the arms of England, while the sterns of the ships indicate the importance of the navy of Hastings, which, as we have seen, was very great for the period. This ensign, originally adopted by the town, subsequently became that of all the other Cinque Ports.* * On the Mayor's seal, which is of the 15th century, by a blunder, probably of the engraver, the middle figure is a whole lion, without the ship's stern. The other ports uniformly L.ar the ensign as above described."], [266, "220 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The Castle of Hastings is of unknown, though certainly of considerable antiquity. To the old earthwork, on the cliff, suc ceeded an architectural fortress, and as early as the 12th cen tury it contained a royal free chapel, with a Dean and Canons, who had very considerable possessions in East Sussex. This religious establishment must originally have been built on a different site, as in the former half of the 13th century the fraternity obtained royal permission to defend their walls from the frequent inundations of the sea. In the reign of Edward III. it would appear that the castle had gone to decay as a for tress, though the conventual establishment was still kept up, and held its own down to the Reformation. In 1824 some ex cavations were carried on within the castle, and the long hidden traces of the fortifications, towers, gateways, &c, were disclosed, and among the rest tbe ancient chapel of St. Mary-in-the- Castle, which proved to be of the Early English period.* The ruins of the fortress, though a romantic addition to the land scape, are inconsiderable. Hastings was famous for several centuries for its ship-building trade. A favourite yacht of Henry I. was called by its royal owner \" Estnetka mea de Hasting.\" *>-, In August, 1?\u00a78, soon after the accession of Richard II. , the French, in one of their marauding expeditions, frightened away the inhabitants, and burnt the town. Hastings rapidly de clined in prosperity. It soon became a port in name only. The sea made savage inroads, swept away the Priory, and submerged much land, till at length the place took a very inconsiderable place in the roll of English towns. During the civil wars of the 17th century Hastings was not the scene of actual conflict. In July, 1643, however, on a Sunday, when the inhabitants were at church, Colonel Morley, the well-known Parliamentarian commander, entered the town, and scattered his cavalry around it to prevent egress. He summoned the Mayor and Jurats, and demanded all the arms which the townsmen possessed, which were given up to him. Mr. Hinson, curate of All Saints, a stout Royalist, was obliged to break off in the midst of the service, and betake himself to a neighbouring wood for refuge. In May, 1690, Bishop Patrick, who was on a visitation journey, reached Hastings, but could not perform his duties, as there was an alarm of an attack of the French, and the churches were full of soldiers, and the streets crowded with townsmen and country people. The French were certainly off the town, and fired upon it without doing any great mischief. The following year the combined fleets of the French and Dutch made another * Among the eminent persons connected witli the College of Hastings were Thomas a Becket, who was Dean, and William of Wykeham was a prebendary."], [267, "221 HASTINGS. attack, a memorial of which is preserved in two cannon balls fixed to the tower of St. Clement's church. So lately as 1796 a French privateer came into the roads, and attempted to carry off a vessel laden with lime, a commodity for which Hastings was then well known ; but the fishermen manned their boats and recaptured the vessel, took the marauders prisoners, and put them into the cage in High-street. But a greater foe to Hastings than its several attacks by the French were the incursions of that stronger enemy, the sea. Two piers were erected as defences against the watery element in the reign of Elizabeth, but they both yielded to its furious attacks. The disappearance of some of the churches mentioned in ancient records was probably due to the same cause. The inha bitants during the first half of the eighteenth century, seem chiefly to have depended on the fishery, boat-building, the lime trade and smuggling. Towards the end of that century, Hast ings became the resort of invalids and pleasure-seekers, and although its area was then almost limited to the valley between the east and the west hills, many persons of distinguished rank came hither during the summer months. The sheltered situa tion and mild temperament of the place, also induced those afflicted with pulmonary affections to resort to it during winter, many of whom were sent to it by Dr. Matthew Baillie, an able London physician. Hastings was then a rude, though pictur esque little place, consisting mainly of High-street and All- Saints-street. The buildings were generally antiquated and inconvenient, many of them being built of timber. Mrr-W. Durrant Cooper, F.S.A., in Vol. xiv. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" had added much to our general knowledge of this ancient town, both as to its municipal rights and its ancient houses. He also gives many important details respecting the descent of the castle and its dependencies, and he may be considered to have more thoroughly investigated the history of Hastings than any other person. . At the commencement of the present century, Hastings wore a military aspect. A body of 12,000 men were quartered in the neighbourhood, and of these the Duke of Wellington, then Major-General Wellesley, had, in 1806, the command. He resided at Hastings-house, where he took up his abode with his bride on the very day of their marriage. (\" Hast ings Past and Present\"). The resident population of the town at that time did not exceed 3,500. Hastings anciently contained many churches and parishes, most of which latter are now merged in the existing parishes of St. Clement, All Saints, and St. Mary-underTthe-Castle. Pope Nicholas's Taxation, 1291, mentions the chijrches of St. Mar-"], [268, "222 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. garet, St. Leonard, St. Michael, St. Peter, St. Andrew, St. Clement, and All Saints, as well as that of the Holy Trinity of Hastings. Of these the Rev. G. S. Stonestreet gives much in formation in Horsfield's \" Sussex.\" There was also a Hospital of St. Mary Magdalene for decayed brothers and sisters, but of its history and site very little is known. The population returns for 1851 mention as existing or nominal parishes : All Saints, St. Clement, St. Mary-in-the-Castle, St. Andrew, the Holy Trinity (or Priory), St. Michael-on-the-Rock, St. Mary Magda lene, St. Leonard-on-Sea, and St. Mary Bulverhythe. The church of All Saints, which gives name to a principal street, stands at the foot of the East Hill. It is mainly of the early part of the 15th century, and consists of chancel, nave with aisles, south porch, and a western embattled tower in three diminishing stages. Though this church is styled in 1436 \" nova ecclesia,\" it certainly stands on the site of a much earlier building, of which traces remain. The belfry is vaulted with stone, and in the chancel are three sedilia and a piscina. On a slab of black marble at the east end of the north aisle are figures of a man and woman with clasped hands, which formerly had the date of 1458. There is also a brass for \u0152ijomaS <ffi00ti= fllOUgl) and Margaret his wyfe, for whom a paternoster and an ave are solicited. There are many more recent inscriptions, in cluding one for Mile, de Ruffo, daughter of Prince Castelcicala, and another for Mrs. Beasley, a disciple of Swedenborg. In 1586, Henry Elkes, B.A., was executed at Tyburn for counter feiting the Queen's signature to procure his presentation to the parsonage of All Saints (Stowe). The notorious Titus Oates once officiated in this church as minister, and his father, Samuel Oates, was among the rectors. St. Clement's church stands on elevated ground to the west of High-street: It is a rude weather beaten structure of chancel, nave with aisles, and a west em battled tower of singular architecture. The Abbot of Fecamp had license, in 1286, to build a church of St. Clement in Hast ings, de novo, the older structure on lower ground having been destroyed by the sea. The present building, however, is cer tainly of much later date. The font is of the Perpendicular period. It is octagonal in shape, and on the sides of the basin are carved the cross, nails, ladder, whip, spear, &c, the in struments of the Crucifixion. There are two brasses ; one for \u0152ljOtnag J\u00c6Hcffetg, jurat, and Margery his wyf, date 1563; and the other for 3fo|)n iSarlrp, mercer, and Mary his wife, daughter of Robert Harley, &c, date 1601. Other inscriptions commem orate the names of Falkner, Pierse, Bromfield, Milward, Collyer, Delves, Justice, &c. At Halton, a picturesque suburb of Hastings, a chapel also dedicated to St. Clement was erected in"], [269, "223 HASTINGS. 1838, chiefly at the expense of Sarah, Countess Waldegrave. St. Mary-in-the-Castle was built at the expense of the late Earl of Chiehester, lord of the castle and barony, and consecrated in 1828. It is of semicircular form, and stands in the centre of Pel ham Crescent, abutting on the rock which was here hewn down to make way for the Crescent.

The healthful and picturesque situation of Hastings has for many years past attracted persons of distinction and opulence to it, and many important and elegant residences have sprung up in and around it. The public buildings are appropriate. In the Town-hall is a shield, which was taken from the French by General Murray (the first British Governor of Canada) at the conquest of Quebec, and presented by that gallant officer to the Corporation, he being resident afterwards at Beauport, a few miles distant. In the side of the East Hill, in a rock called the Minnis, was one of the few Hermitages wliich Sussex possessed. In the last century it contained a cross with a niche for a saint carved out of the rock. In the side of the opposite hill are some excavations known as St. Clement's Caves, originally made in digging for sand, and afterwards used by smugglers.

The charities of the town are generously supported by the local families, and Sarah, Countess Waldegrave, ranks foremost among the benefactors in recent times. Among well-known natives or residents of the town have been the notorious Titus Oates, who is said to have lived in All Saints-street ; Sir Cloudesley Shoved lived in another house in the same street ; Edward Capel, the Shaksperean editor, dwelt in what is called East Cliff House. Among dis tinguished temporary visitors may be mentioned Garrick (who planted a slip from Shakspeare's famous mulberry tree at the residence called Scott's-house), the Duke of Wellington, Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, the Princess Sophia-Matilda, Lord Thurlow, Canning, the Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria, Queen Adelaide, the present Emperor of the French, King Louis Philippe, after his abdication of the throne, with members of his family,, the Queen of the Belgians, Guizot, Thiers, Lane, author of \" Modern Egyptians,\" and many other well-known persons. We must not omit Charles Lamb, who \" did penance \" here once. He says, \" I love town and country, but this detestable Cinque-port is neither .... There is no sense of home at Hastings.

Less than forty years ago it was a byword for the wildness of its aspect, the rusticity of its few and scattered cottagers, and the miryness of its roads. It was then known as \" Heward's Hawth.\" To-day it is the abode of civilization, many vidas and pleasure residences having sprung up almost as by magic, in consequence of the establishment of an important station of the London and Brighton Railway, and consequent facilities of access. It is about 13 miles from Brighton and 37 from London. A church, dedicated to St. Wdfred, has recently been erected. It seats 700 persons, and cost upwards of \u00a35,000. An ecclesiastical district has been assigned to it, and the Rev. R. E. Wyatt, M.A., of Exeter Col lege,Oxon, is the incumbent.

Q"], [272, "226 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Fine ordnance was cast here. When the late Major Fuller en tered on his first campaign in India, he found with surprise some of the guns inscribed with the name of his native parish, \" Heathfield.\" Heathfield Park, formerly known as Bailey Park, belonged in the fifteenth century to the noble family of Fynes, Lords Dacre, of Hurst-Monceux, and is supposed to be the park which they possessed \" somewhere in Sussex,\" that had so compact a boundary hedge of holly that the smallest game could not escape from it. The present park is surrounded with a stone wall some miles in compass. Thomas, Lord Dacre, sold it about 1675 to Hercules Poulett, Esq., and it passed succes sively to Plummer, Fuller of Waldron, Blackmore, O'Keefe, and to General Elliott, the hero of Gibraltar, who resided here, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Heathfield in 1787. In 1791 it was purchased by Mr. Francis Newbery, the eminent druggist of St. Paul's Church-yard, and in 1819 it passed by sale to Sir Chas. R. Blunt, Bart., whose nephew, Sir C. W. Blunt, Bart., now possesses it. The mansion was completed by Ray mond Blackmore, Esq., who was resident here in 1 722. During Mr. Newbery's possession considerable acquisitions were made to the estate, and he built on a conspicuous eminence the \" Heathfield Monument,\" a structure sufficiently plain in itself, but a fine ornament to the landscape for many miles round. It is inscribed to the Defender of Gibraltar, \" Calpis Defensori.\" It stands 600 feet above the sea level, cost \u00a33,000, and com mands a prospect which includes the sea, the South Downs, the Weald, and more than 40 churches. For a brief notice of Lord Heathfield, see \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 76. Cade Street, vulgo Cat Street, is a hamlet of this parish. It takes its name from the notorious pretender, Jack Cade, \" Cap tain of Kent,\" who appears to have been born here, and who was here slain, after his outlawry in 1450, by Alexander Iden, Sheriff of Kent. The spot of his capture is indicated by a kind of monumental pillar, erected by Mr. Newbery. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 55.) The manor house of Newick, which had a chapel, was once called Cade's Castle. The manor of Heathfield belongs to Earl De la Warr, and several other lordships extend into the parish. A remarkable event occurs here on the day of \" Hefful \" fair, April 14th, when, according to a very ancient tradition, an old woman lets the first cuckoo out of a basket. Certain it is that the cheering note of this bird is rarely heard before that day. The tradition of a battle here in Saxon times, a. d. 633, is quite unsupported. Heathfield is the corpus of a prebend in Chiehester Cathedral. The church (Ad Saints) consists of a nave with aisles, a chancel,"], [273, "227 HEEKE and a west tower, surmounted with a shingled spire. There are six beds, the tenor inscribed to St. John. The south aisle, rebuilt in 1861, was apparently the original church of the Norman period, and consisted of a pace, or nave, and chancel, the main body of the edifice being a subsequent addition. A brass to the memory of a lady, supposed to be of the Fynes family, was dis covered many years since. The tower is built of chalk, faced with Heathfield stone. In the interior of it is the date 1445, considered by Mr. T. Wright to be the oldest authentic in scribed date in Arabic numerals in England. (See Journ. Brit. Arch. Assoc, ii, 157.)

The extension of that town called West Worthing lies chiefly in this chapelry, which consists of 546 acres. Nearly the whole of the land has been purchased by the West Worthing Investment Company, who have built many mansions and large houses, baths, waterworks, &c, so that this once insignificant hamlet is fast growing into a fashionable suburb.

It then passed with Wiston, &c, through the Braoses to the Shirleys, and in 5th Edward VI. Thomas Shirley, Esq. died seised of it. The other moiety descended to Godfrey le Fauconer, who died in 1279. His grandson, John, sold it in 1303 to William de la Field, and we next find it, 1398, in possession of the all-absorbing Fitz Alans, Earls of Arundel. It afterwards formed part of the endow ment of Holy Trinity Hospital at Arundel. The moieties hav ing been re-united, Sir Thomas Palmer, in 1557, sold the whole manor to Thomas Cooke, Esq., whose family had long held it of the hospital. In 1676, Thomas Arnold, gentleman, was lord, and his descendant sold it in 1734, and it subsequently passed by sale, first to Butler of Worminghurst, and then to the Rich ardson family. The chapel continued dependent on the mother church of Tarring, but it fell to ruin, and in 1766 it was pulled down. (Cartwright.) Mr. Bray, the historian of Surrey, in formed Mr. Cartwright that in 1 755 he was sent to enquire as to a wreck which had been claimed by the lord of the manor. The tenant told him that when he was young he used to play at cricket where high -water mark then existed, without danger of striking the ball into the sea, which proves the rapid corro sive action of the ocean here as on many other parts of our southern coast.

The etymology is Anglo- Saxon, the lofty, or high tun, or enclosure, which answers to the situation of the village. According to Domesday, Gundulph held the manor of Edward the Confessor. In 47th Henry III. Thomas de Rudeham was lord. Subsequent proprietors have been Sackville, Mestede, and Springett. Heighton St. Clere in Firle is a sub-infeudation. It belonged, temp.

The church, dedicated to St. Martin, was damaged by lightning inl769, and the parishioners suffered it to go to ruin. Since that date all sacred offices for the parish have been performed at Tarring. Only a few fragments of the walls remain. The basin of the font is now used for its original purpose at Chiddingly.

The parish lies on the southern border of the Weald, extends from south to north several miles, and is intersected by the little river Cuckmere. The manors of Laughton, Berwick, Alciston, and WiUingdon extend into it, and those of Warlington and Horselunges lie principally within its limits. Part of the now enclosed waste called the Dicker is also in the parish. The farms called Boreship, Perryland, and Attrees, forming the \" borough \" of Ralphshurst, are a de tached portion of the hundred of Danehid-Horsted. The mansion caded the Broad, connected with the manor of War lington, was from the early part of the 17th century the seat of the Calverley family, descended from the great Yorkshire house of that name, and their connections, the Masons, untd within the last few years, when it passed to a distant relative, the Rev, S. W. Warneford, D.D., who bequeathed it to trustees for the use of the Radcliffe Lunatic Asylum, Oxfordshire. Horselunges belonged, 33rd Henry VI., to Sir John Devenish, who married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Lord Hoo and Hastings, and it continued for some generations with his de scendants. Of their timber-built and moated mansion consi derable remains exist. It is of the 15th century, and contains"], [276, "230 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. in the windows several shields of arms for the Devenishes and their connections, including Hoo, Morton, Lytton, Engaine, &c. Carter's Corner was long the residence of the Barton family ; Boreship that of a branch of the Fullers and Winkinghurst of the Millers. The last now belongs to Mrs. Woodward, a descendant of the Masons and Calverleys. The Roman Catholic Bishop of London, for the time being, holds for charitable uses the farms called Grovehill and Grovebridge. Hellingly Park was long the seat of a branch of the Pelham family, and still belongs to the Earl of Chiehester. It was near this park, then belonging to Sir Nicholas Pelham, that Thomas Lord Dacre, of Hurst Monceux Castle, and his companions, while un lawfully hunting deer, slew John Busbrigge, one of Pelham' s keepers, for which his lordship and three of his friends were executed, in 1541 . The actual spot of the murder was Pickhay, a field near Hellingly church. Hoksebeidge is a large village or hamlet in this parish on the main road from Lewes to Hailsham, Battle, &c. In the time of Edward I. it gave name to the family of De Hurstebregg. The Hailsham union-house is also in the parish. At Amberstone is a large stone, which from its name was probably Druidical. It gives name to a good farm-house close by, in which, in the year 1815, Mr. Rickman, the quaker tenant, had the honour of showing hospitality to the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, and their suites, on their hurried journey from Ports mouth to Dover. The church (St. Peter and St. Paul) is composed of chancel, nave, with north and south aisles, and a western tower (rebuilt in 1836). On the north side of the chancel is a chantry-chapel attached to the manor of Horselunges. There are some traces of Norman work, but Early English and later styles prevail. It is many years since I saw this church ; it then contained a brass, despoded of its ornaments \u2014 probably for a lady of the Devenish family. John Milles, the Protestant minister of this church, was burnt at Lewes, in 1557. [S. A. C. Church given to Otteham Abbey, v, 158. Bikeward of, ibid. Millers of Winkinghurst, ix, 33.

A de tached slip extending to the Downs, and containing nearly 80 acres, is surrounded by Beeding. Such insulations are by no means uncommon in Sussex. In the year 770 the manor of Henfield was given by Osmund, King of the West Saxons, to the see of Selsey, and it stid belongs to the Bishop of Chiehester. In Domesday it is stated to be in the territory ofthe Bishop, who holds it personally in demesne. In the reign ofthe Confessor it had been rated at 15 hides; but now it was estimated at somewhat less than 11. The arable was 20 plough-lands, and there were 20 villeins, 15 bondsmen, and a church. The mill and fishery were in the hands of William de Braose, who appears to have held certain possessions under the Bishop. Three burgesses in Lewes held of the manor. In the time of King Edward it was valued at \u00a310, and after wards at \u00a37. Several other details are set forth in the record. In the reign of Henry I. the Bishop had a grant of free-warren. Streatham, which gives name to the Bishop's manor, is on the south-west side of the parish. \" It is now merely a cottage, but there is very near it a moat, enclosing a small piece of ground, called the chapel garden, and there are also the remains of ex tensive foundations, the site, as is supposed, of the castle of Earl Warbald and his Countess Tidburga, to whom it belonged previously to its donation by King Osmund to the Bishop.\" (Cartwright.) It appears that the early Bishops made this their occasional residence, as several episcopal documents are dated from Henfield. The village is remarkably neat, and in fact there is through out the parish an appearance of comfort not always to be met with in the Wealden parishes. This is in great measure owing to the excellent influence of the Borrer family. To that famdy belonged the late William Borrer, Esq., a distinguished member of the Linn\u00e6an, Royal, and other learned societies. He was un doubtedly the most able botanist that our county has produced, and one ofthe most benevolent of men. He died in 18o2, at the age"], [278, "232 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. of 81. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 71. for a sidl memoir.) His collection of such plants as will grow in this climate was probably the largest ever made, amounting to the great number of 6,660. Chestham is an ancient estate in this parish, long in the family of Wood, as also is Wantley. The latter is mentioned in Domesday as being held by Ralph, of Wdliam de Braose, and formerly by Azor, a tenant of Harold, who had two vdleins, two bondsmen, two servi, a mid, &c. At a later date it became part of the possessions of Lewes priory, and at the dissolution passed through Thomas, Lord Cromwell, to the Sackvilles and Michels. The subsequent proprietors, by purchase, were Boniface, Medley, and Wood of Chestham. Sheeprods, another estate, belonged to the great family of Covert, and by subsequent transfers to those of Cheale, Hoffman, and Faulkner. The impropriation was long the corpus of a prebend in Chiehester cathedral, the last prebendary being Robert Sher burne, the celebrated Bishop of Chiehester, by whom the pre bendal estate was annexed to that see. Cartwright prints a curious document which shows the necessitous condition of the poor vicars of the period, 1209. Thomas Lowe, canon of Chi ehester, with the assent of Bishop Nicholas, grants to John Stowred, vicar of Henfield, the means whereby he and his suc cessors may be able to live for the future \" in an honourable manner, and have a suitable maintenance, and not be reduced to the opprobrious necessity of begging !\" The church (St. Peter), mentioned under that invocation in Osmund's charter, 770, is a building of no pretensions. It con sists of a nave, with aisles, and a chancel, not older, apparently, than the time of Edward III. There is a chapel on the north side, and a tower at the west end crowned with battlements ; but these are more recent additions. The east window of the chancel is conjectured by Cartwright to have been the gift of Thomas Beckington, prebendary of Henfield, and afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells, temp. Henry VI. The mortuary in scriptions commemorate the names of Cheale, Gratwicke, Hoff man, Baley, Kenwedmersh, Reynsford, Agates, Ellis,' Cobb, Holney, Tireman, Pilfold, Lintott, Roberts, Bishop, Woolven, &c. In the impropriator's chancei is a raised altar-tomb with the figure of a man in brass, in a furred gown, to the memory of Cljomas iSgstfPP* There are six bells. A celebrated native of Henfield was Dr. Thomas Stapleton, born 1535. Descended from an ancient Yorkshire family, he was early destined for holy orders, and was bred at Winchester, and at New College, Oxford. On the accession of Elizabeth, he adhered to Roman Catholicism, and was obliged to go into exile in Flanders. He pursued his theological studies with great"], [279, "233 HEYSHOTT. ardour, travelled into France and Italy, and ultimately returned to Louvaine. Being summoned home by his father he was ar raigned before Barlow, Bishop of Chiehester, and deprived of such church preferment as he held. His subsequent career as a theological writer and controversialist is given by Cartwright. He was one of the founders of the well-known codege of Douay. He is characterized as \" a man of mild demeanour and un suspected integrity.\" He died at Louvaine in 1598, at the age of 64, leaving behind him a name for learning and benevolence which did honour to his age and country. The name of Streatham is supposed to denote proximity to a Roman road, and slight traces of a vicinal way are stid trace able. [S. A. C. Saxon church, viii, 182. Domesday watermill, v, 270.

Though there is no mention of the manor, eo nomine, in Domesday, it formed part of the lands held by Wil liam de Perci, of Earl Roger de Montgomeri. Temp. Henry VIII. Henry, Earl of Northumberland, sold it to Sir Widiam Fitz- William, who held it by fealty and a pair of gilt spurs. After several changes of proprietorship it passed to Charles, Earl of Egremont, and his representative, Lord Leconfield, is now lord. Hotle is a small hamlet in this parish. At Dunford Farm was born the late Richard Cobden, M.P., eminent for his political abilities and status. Mr. Cobden, who belonged to a very old Sussex family, rebuilt the house, which he had pur chased, retaining the room in which he first saw the light, and he was buried in 1865, in Heyskot&Churchyard. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 290-294.) The church, which has features of the"], [280, "234 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Decorated and subsequent styles, is plain and uninteresting, and has been repaired.

Hastings, the chief of the Cinque Ports, had several members or \" limbs,\" that is subsidiary territories, parochial or other- wise. Of these Seaford and Pevensey were the chief \u2014 the others being Bulverhithe, Hydoneye, Iham, Beakesbourne, Greenhithe, and Northeye. Several of these have become greatly diminished in importance, and at least two of them have left scarcely a vestige above ground. These are Hidneye and Northeye. They are both situated in the marshes of East Sussex, between Hastings on the east and Beachy-head and Willingdon on the west. As their name implies, they were both eyes (Anglo-Saxon, ig.), islands, or at least lands elevated above a waterish level. The Rev E. Turner has written the history of both these \" lost towns \" in the \" Sussex Collections,\" Vol. xix., and has brought together every discovery that has been made concerning them. Noethete, though mentioned last in the list of \" limbs,\" seems to have been more important than Hidneye, and it possesses more history. The remains, trifling in extent, of its church or chapel of St. James, were standing only a few years since, and several carved stones and other relics have been occasionally found. The situation, marked on our old county maps, from Speed in 1610 to Cary in 1787, mark the site, which lies between two and three miles north-east of Pevensey, but in the parish of Bexhill, within what was known as the Liberty of the Sluice. Mr. Turner conjectures that the influx of the sea destroyed the old town (as at Winchelsea), and that a new town was built ; but on these points consult Mr. Turner and Mr. Thomas Ross, both living witnesses. As \" ruin\u00e6 etiam periere,\" few readers will feel deeply interested in the matter. In ancient documents many records of North- eye occur, chiefly in relation to the transfer of lands. It gave name to the family of De Northey, temp. Edward I., and the parish retained ecclesiastical rights as lately as the beginning of the 16th century. Htdonte, now called Hidney, is in the parish of Willing- don, about a mile and a half from the church, and several pieces of land are still known as The Hidneys. The small town (for it never could have been very large) probably stood upon Court"], [281, "235 HOLLINGTON. Hidney, where the surface is very uneven and broken, doubtless by human agency, and within the memory of old men stones and other debris of the extinct town were occasionally turned up.

W. B. Lewis, of High-beech, Edward Farncombe, Esq., &c. This parish is situated on the ridges north of St. Leonards on-Sea, between that town and Beauport Park, which lies partly in Hodington and partly in Westfield and Battle. \" Contribu tions\" to its history were furnished by the late incumbent to the \" Sussex Collections,\" Vol. xxi. The manor is mentioned in Domesday under the mis-spelling of Horintune, as having been held in the time of the Confessor, as free or allodial land, by Godwin and Alestan. In the 13th century the families of Hastings and De Penhurst were proprietors, and were succeeded by those of Belknap, Botiler, Mylle, Ulvedale, and Stowe, who appear to have held them of the honour of Hastings. Richard Dalyngruge, of the Bodiam family, held the manors of Hoding ton and Wilton of that barony, 10th Edward IV., by fealty, and 22s. as castle-guard rent, payable to Sir Widiam Hastings. Subsequent lords have been the Poundes, the Pelhams, and their heritors the Papillons. The parish church (St. Laurence) is situated in a wood, by which it is wholly surrounded. It is a small, uninteresting, middle-pointed (Decorated) building, of nave, surmounted by a dove-cote head containing one bell, chancel inclining to the south, and a south porch. The church has been \" restored,\" or in other words, much altered ; and, as a natural consequence, several old monuments and inscriptions have disappeared \u2014 among them those of some of the Eversfields, and of several vicars, &c. The period of the edifice before the alterations was doubtless of the 14th century, but that had no doubt superseded a much older structure. This church had in bye-gone times the notoriety of being a favourite resort for secret marriages,"], [282, "236 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. especially when the bride had loved \" not wisely but too well.\" The requirements of the parish, caused by the settlement in it of 600 or 700 persons, necessitated the erection, in 1865, of a new church at Ashbrook, formerly Washbrook, so designated from a stream hard by. It is dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, and built in the Early English style. The family of Eversfield, very ancient in Sussex, owned and occupied Grove, a mansion in this parish, previously the posses sion of the Levitts, a family of Norman antiquity, whose heiress, Mary Levitt, married, in 1586, Thomas Eversfield, Esq., of Uckfield, ancestor of Ch. Gilbert Eversfield, Esq., of Denne Park, in Horsham, who has a large interest in the new and fashionable part of Hastings. The old house was destroyed in 1804, and a modern residence called Grove-house erected on the spot. The modern mansion of Captain Lewis, called High beech, takes its name from a lofty, ancient beech tree, said to be as old as the time of Elizabeth, which forms a conspicuous ob ject from a great distance. Castleham stands on a commanding eminence, and is traditionally supposed to indicate the site of some early fortifications. It is the residence of Mr. Alderman Stone. May it not have been the land out of which the \" castle guard rent,\" due to the lords of Hastings, arose ? Wilting, in Hollington, is the Wiltingham of Domesday, when it was estimated at 80s., the previous estimate in the days of the Confessor having been 100s. There was a park. Ingelram, perhaps the founder of the Sussex family of Ingram, was the mesne tenant, and Reinbert, Ralph, and Robert were minor proprietors. Temp. Henry II. a chapel existed on this manor. The manor was the corpus of a prebend in the royal free chapel of the College of Hastings, and Wilting chapel was doubtless appurtenant to that establishment. With respect to a supposed chapel of St. Leonard in this parish, distinct from both those of Hollington and the neigh bouring parish, always recognized as St. Leonard (on-Sea), some difficulty exists. The. Rev. S. Arnott's paper may be consulted on the subject. [S. A. C. Two Domesday mills, v, 271. Campion of, x, 3. Chapel of Wilting, xiii, 137. Tithes to Hastings College, ibid.

Date of earliest Parish Be gister, 1609. Acreage, 2,448. Chief Landowners, the Earl of Ashburnham and Thomas Brassey, Esq. The surface of this parish is mainly excellent marsh-level. The river Ashbourne, or Walder's Haven, passes through part ofthe parish. The more inland part, however, possesses agreeable undulations, though of no great eminence. The name of the parish is probably derived from the Anglo-Saxon Hoh, an eleva tion. There are, or were formerly, several ancient houses in Hooe, the principal of wliich are Court Lodge, and Grove House, which occupies the site of a medieval edifice, and formerly be longed to the noble family of Ashburnham. Another mansion belonged to the family of Elfred. The parish had been at an early period the residence of the knightly and afterwards noble family of Hooe. In 20th Henry V. Thomas Hooe, who had been knighted for his great services and large expenses in the King's wars, obtained a grant of \u00a31 1 per annum. He afterwards became a Baron and a Knight of the Garter. His will is dated 33rd Henry VI. His daughters and heirs-general married into the families of Echingham, Carew, Copley, Massingberd, and Devenish. But to go back to the early history of this parish, Owe, How, or Hooe, belonged, before the Conquest, to Earl Godwin. The Conqueror gave it to the Earl of Eu. Henry, Earl of Eu, gave the manor to the Abbey of Bee in Normandy, about the begin ning of the 12th century, and a small Priory of Benedictine Monks was established here. It was given by Henry VI. to Eton College, and by Edward IV. to Ashford College, Kent. Its subse - quent descent is somewhat obscure ; but it belonged to the Sack villes and afterwards to the Fullers. That at an earlier period it had belonged to John, Duke of Bedford, celebrated as the Gover nor of France, temp. Henry VI., as asserted in Magna Britannia, is, I think, an error. However, the descent of Hooe is very obscure. Thechurch (St. James, or St. Oswald) \"is an antique edifice,and comprises a low and massive embattled tower, nave, and chancel, with a small chapel on the north side \" (Horsfield) . The last probably belonged to the principal manor. In the chancel there is a very small piscina. In the east window are two regal figures, supposed of Edward III. and Philippa, his queen. In 1781 Sir William. Burrell caused drawings of these figures to be made, and they are now in the Burrell MSS. The building appears to be principally Early English. It formerly had two brasses, long since torn from their slabs, one for ivicijarii Jtjollyrr, and Mar garet and Alice, his wives, 1539, with the usual \"Of your"], [284, "238 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. charitie,\" &c. ; the other for Thomas Acrouch, yeoman, and Elizabeth his wife, 1576 and 1569. There are also mural monuments for the Fuller family. This church contains five beds. Among the incumbents of this parish, in the last cen tury, was Nathaniel Torriano, formerly a physician, who is best known as the author of a sermon, preached here and at Ninfield, on the earthquake at Lisbon \u2014 a publication widely circulated at the time, but now rarely to be met with.

An elegant monograph, called \" Horsham ; its History and Antiquities\" (1868), from the pen of Miss D. Hurst, will much lighten the labour which would otherwise be necessary in this work, in the description of a large and very interesting parish. I shall chiefly fodow Miss Hurst's tasteful arrangement, though perhaps I may not agree with her in every particular. Horsham, which in point of picturesque beauty is excelled by few towns in Sussex, and which has very noble \" surroundings,\" probably derives its name from some Saxon Horsa, though"], [285, "239 HORSHAM. whether he was the brother of Hengist is more than doubtful, the name having been very common among the Angles and Saxons. The final ham is, however, a sufficient proof of Saxon antiquity. Little is known of the history of this town and parish. It formed part of the great possessions of Widiani de Braose, lord of the Rape of Bramber, and has descended, so far as the lordship is concerned, through the Mowbrays and Howards to the present Duke of Norfolk. Temp. Henry III. a dispute arose between the parishes of Horsham and Shipley as to boundary. Before this the patronage of Horsham church had been bestowed by John, Lord de Braose, on the Nunnery of Rusper, and in 1247 an amicable arrangement was made between Robert de Samford, Master of the Temple in England, and the Prioress of Rusper, Olivia de Bissopeston \u2014 the boundary being definitely arranged. Horsham has been a Parliamentary Borough from 1295, but by the Reform Act it has lost one of its members. From very early times Horsham had a \" merchant's guild,\" which proves it to have been a place of some commercial importance. The circumstance of -the church being large is considered by Miss Hurst as a proof that the population was large at the time of its erection ; but this does not follow, for the size of a church in old times does not refer so much to the number of parishioners as to the liberality of the founder. It is highly probable, how ever, that in the thirteenth century the parish was populous, as by an endowment of Ralph, Bishop of Chiehester, in 1231, it was arranged that the vicar should be provided with a chaplain, a deacon, and a sub-deacon. In 1404, Bishop Rede ordained, in this church, eleven deacons and eight priests, and the next year three deacons and six priests, besides acolytes and sub deacons. King Edward I. visited Horsham twice in 1299, and probably had his lodging at Chesworth manor-house. Edward II. was at Chesworth in 1324. In 1338 Horsham was noted for its quarrels, or arrows shot from crossbows. Six thousand of such aiTows, costing 14d. per sheaf of 240, were sent from this town to the tower of London, the carriage and commodity amounting to \u00a314 10s. 4d. Horse-shoes were also largely manu factured, the price being \u00a34 3s. 4d. per 1,000. The plague visited the parish in 1560 and 1574, but with no great severity. In 1643 the population was estimated at 1500 souls. During the civil wars of this period, there was a strong contest between the Boyalists and the Roundheads. A letter, now first printed by Miss Hurst, from the original in the British Museum, gives a graphic account of the state and feeling of parties here and at Pulborough. The letter is written by a Royalist, and signed"], [286, "240 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. \" R. T.\" The writer says : \" With us at Horsuni, we are now 500 men in arms. The reason was this. Upon Friday, June 16 (1648) the magazine which was laid up at this town was com manded by the committee to Arundell ; but our countrymen are generally so iU-affected that they rose with one consent, and two or three hundred appeared in an instant, leaving their mattocks and plows to rescue the swords and musquets.\" The letter, which is ambiguously worded, seems to show that the inhabi tants were generally on the King's side. A sharp engagement on a small scale took place between the Parliamentary forces and the townsmen, in which one soldier and three inhabitants were killed, but the number of wounded is not recorded. John Michell, Esq., of Stammerham, according to a tradition of the family, lost his life in an engagement with the Cromwellians at Horsham, his son being also wounded. The family long pre served the sword of the younger Michell. Miss Hurst relates many other particulars of the civil war, too long for transcrip tion in these pages. It is difficult to ascertain what the popular feeling of the Horshamites was at the Restoration of Charles II. ; but as the \" merry monarch \" noted three* of the principal inhabitants of the parisb, Thomas Middleton, Edward Eversfield, and John Eversfield, as knights of his intended order of the \" Royal Oak,\" we may presume that Royalist feelings were in the ascendant. In the reign of William III. a somewhat re markable trial took place in this town. \" The circle at St. Germains (says Dr. Doran, in \" Monarchs retired from Busi ness\") was startled to hear that the Duke of Monmouth was alive and active in England. ... A pseudo-Duke had travelled with a little court, by whom he was styled ' your Grace,' and treated with an infinite measure of respect. He was a hand some fellow, and his good looks at once convinced the women that he was the true prince.\" But alas ! he turned out to be the son of an Innkeeper called Savage, and was tried at Horsham as a common vagrant and swindler, and punished accordingly. Among the barbarities now happily obsolete, that of bull baiting was formerly practised in the space called the Carfax, in this town, and to the shame of humanity, and of the last age, be it said, that this abominable practice was only put down so lately as 1814, to the great discontent of the rougher inhabitants. The town and borough of Horsham occupy a central part of the parish. It is in the midst of a fertile district, surrounded by very picturesque scenery. The river Arun passes to the south of the town, but is of no great importance here. There are four main or principal streets, called North, South, East, and West streets. In the centre of the town is an open square, and near this is the Town Hall. The spot caded Carfax is a corruption,"], [287, "HORSHAM. 241 I think, of \" Quatrevoies,\" a place where four roads meet. This name is well-known at Oxford, and in many towns in France. A row of houses is caded the ArchbishoiDrick, as being within the lhanor of Tarring, which belonged to the see of Canterbury. What will most \" strike the stranger \" are the foot pavements of Horsham stone, formerly largely procured in this district, and now to be seen on numerous churches and ancient houses in various parts of Sussex. The stones belong to an ancient geo logical formation, and bear distinct marks of sea-side ripples, such as we behold to-day on the sands of Worthing. There is a place caded \" the Normandy,\" which formerly possessed some ancient vestiges, and there is a perennial spring called the \" Normandy well.\" Until the year 1830, the spring assizes were held here, but the town-hall not being sufficiently commodious, they were removed to Lewes. The midsummer quarter-sessions for the Western division of Sussex are still held here. Many manors extend into this parish. Of these, Shortfield, Nutham, Hawksbourne, and Marlpost belong to Robert H. Hurst, Esq. Roffey, or Roughway, which formerly belonged to the Lords Hoo and Hastings, afterwards to the Westons, is now part of the Arnndel estate. The little manor of Heweds, prin cipally within the town, belongs to Henry Padwick, Esq. The manor of the park of Chesworth, and the manor of Denne, belong to Charles G. Eversfield, Esq. The manors of Sompting- Peverell, and Den-in-Warnham, the property of Thomas Wisden, Esq., also extend into the parish. At the south of the town, and a very visible object from the Mid-Sussex railway, stands one of the grandest churches of the Sussex Weald. It is dedicated to St. Mary, and occupies the site of an earlier building of Norman date, some traces of which remain. The tower is of a very early period, and the shingled broach spire is said to reach the height of 230 feet \u2014 sed dubito \u2014 but, if the measurement be correct, it would be, after Chiehester Cathedral, the loftiest in the county. It is supposed that the church, as we now see it, was erected by the Prioress and Con vent of Rusper, near at hand, who held the rectorial tithes. The church is 146 feet long. With regard to the interior, Miss Hurst observes that there is \" nothing more striking than the extreme regularity and simplicity of the whole design ; the chancel and the nave being of the same width and height, and the aisles extending in uniform lines from end to end. The clerestory, which is of unusual height, rests on a noble arcade of eight bays, and is lighted by nine lancet windows.\" On the south side of the great east window is an arched niche with a piscina and credence. The capitals and bases of the arcade dividing the nave and chancel from the aisles are of late Norman E"], [288, "242 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. work, the chancel having a larger amount of ornamentation than the nave. In 1307 Walter Burgess erected, adjacent to the north aisle, a chantry chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity, which he endowed with fifty acres of land, and 39s. 4d. rent. It is in the Early Decorated style, with an elegant window at the east end. Beneath this chantry chapel there is a vaulted crypt, measuring nineteen feet by fourteen. In 1447, license was granted to Richard Wakehurst to found another chantry, to be called Boteler's chantry, for a chaplain to sing a daily requiem at the altar of St. Michael, which probably stood at the east end ofthe south aisle. A Brotherhood was anciently connected with this church and with Rusper Nunnery, after the donation of the benefice to that convent, by John de Braose, in 1231 ; and it would appear that they had an oratory in this church, now known as the \" Shelley Chapel,\" from the fact of its having been the burial-place of that family. In the Visitation ol Sussex in 1634, three shields of the Mowbrays are mentioned in the \" south-body \" of the church, and in the east window were fourteen coats of this and other ancient families. The whole of the building has now a wagon-head ceihng in pannelled oak, with the Mowbray cognizances, and was doubtless put up when the Dukes of Norfolk, of that family, were owners of Ches worth, and lords of the borough of Horsham. Miss Hurst observes that from 1375 to 1550 this edifice was \" a noble pile,\" and so it must have been, though it has since undergone con siderable transformations. The font is supposed to be of the fifteenth century. Within the last two or three centuries, many barbarous alterations have been made in the fabric, but in and since 1864 a restoration of it has been carried out. Many of the original features have been reinstated ; but of some of the ornamentations I shall say nothing. The church contains many interesting monuments, several of which must be specially noticed. On the south side of the communion table, on an altar-tomb, with escocheons, lies a somewhat rude presentment in ftdl armour, of Thomas, Lord Braose, who was owner of Chesworth manor. (For the Braose family see Beambee.) He died in 1395, aged 42. On the north side of the chancel is a tomb of Purbeck marble, with an enriched canopy of rather striking aspect, to the memory of Thomas Hoo. It has been ascribed to Lord Hoo and Hastings, descended from an ancient knightly Kentish family ; but more probably it commemorates his step-brother, who, by a practice, not unusual for several centuries, also bore the name of Thomas ; since the first and only Lord Hoo (created 1447), in his will, gives instructions for the burial of his body in Battle Abbey. Sir Thomas Hoo, then an esquire only, gave, in 1480, to the Abbot and Convent of"], [289, "243 HORSHAM. Battle, twenty marks per annum, arising out of lands in Hor sham and Rusper, which he appears to have purchased of vari ous persons, including the names ofHortle, Cloterwyn, Bon wick, Michel, Boteler, John, Duke of Norfolk, and of Widiam, son of Walter Lower. (See Thorpe's \" Catalogue of the Charters of Battle Abbey,\" p. 124.) On the south side of the Braose monu ment is the altar-tomb, with an effigy in white marble of Eliza beth, wife of Thomas Delves, Esq., and daughter of Had Ravens croft, Esq., of Horsham, who died in 1654. On the pavement of the chancel is a brass for a priest of the 15th century, but the head and inscription have been removed. Following Miss Hurst's arrangement, there are mural monu ments and inscriptions for the following families and names : Robert Hurst, Esq., long M.P. for Horsham, who died in 1843, aged 93, and members of his family ; Benetta, wife of H. W. Simpson, formerly vicar of the parish ; John Michell, of Stam merham, 1610 ; several members of the family of Eversfield, Barts, dating from 1668 ; Jameson, Marshall, Jenden, God win, Revel, Mair, Slade, Du Cane, Marriott, By sshe- Shelley (Baronets), Smith,Hurst, Tredcroft (an ancient Horsham family), White, Cheynel, Medwin, Edis, Thornton, Chasemore, Wolf, and Pigg. There are, or have been, also memorials of a more interesting character, as for Thomas Pyke, \" barber and chy rurgion,\" 1681 ; and for Robert Hurst, of Hurst Hill, 1483 ; and Richard Hurst, 1592. In the window of the north chancel there was an \u00a9rats pro attttnaftug of William Attwood, and Alice his wife, \" who caused that window to be made in 1425.\" Among other memorials ruthlessly destroyed, either by churchwardens of an earlier date, or by so-called church-restorers in our own days, was one to Katherine, wife of John Reynell, vicar, who died in child-bed of her 21st child, in 1707. The epitaph was \u2014 \" Hard fate of motbers who receive their death, By those to whom they kindly gave their breath.\" A gravestone was inscribed with an \u00a9rate for the souls of Thomas and Elizabeth Covert, with the date 1495. Another de stroyed memorial solicited a prayer for the \" soidles \" of Richard Foys and Elizabeth his wife, 1514. Sir William Burrell, in his invaluable MSS., records still another, which is very interest ing:\u2014 \"In mortem Georgii Allen. Quod suit esse, quod est, quod non suit esse, quod esse, Esse quod est, non esse quod est non est erit esse, Vita malis plena est pia mors pretiosa est Post mortem mors est, post mortem vita beata est.\" There are, or have been, other memorials to the names of e 2"], [290, "244 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Middleton, Dumbrill, Groombridge, Rowland, Higgon, Wood year, Parsons, Hall, Waller, Brian, Howes, Wicker, Griffiths, Curtis, Pilfold, Hewith, Ellis, Longhurst, Foster, Ramsden, Barrow, Norman, White, Williams, &c. There was formerly a chantry dedicated to the Holy Trinity in the church porch, the foundation of which is unknown ; but in 27th Henry VIII. it belonged, with its lands, to John Caryll, Esq. In 1447 Richard Wakehurst had a chantry at the altar of St. Michael, which is said to have been founded by license of Henry VI., by John Body and others, for the soul of Henry Boteler, or Butler, whence it was known as Boteler's chantry. The church contains one of the finest organs in Sussex, and a grand peal of eight bells, all modern. Besides the parish church, there is a chapel-of-ease, or church, in North Street, dedicated to St. Mark. It was erected in 1840 at a cost of \u00a33,600, in the Early English style. A Roman Catholic chapel (St. John the Evangelist) was built in 1865, in Springfield Road, at a cost of about \u00a32,000, by the Duchess of Norfolk. It is in the Early English style. There are also dissenting chapels for almost every denomination of Christians, and a general cemetery. The vicarage-house is neat and con venient, with picturesque grounds. There is a free school, founded by Richard Codyer, of London, mercer, a native of the parish, who by his will, dated 1532, directs masses to be said in Horsham church for his soul and for those of his father and mother, leaving a certain sum for that purpose \u2014 the overplus to be devoted to bread and cheese and ale for the parishioners, and another sum wherewith to buy, hi Lent, herrings for the poor. The school-house to the south-east of the church stands on a rising ground, and was rebuilt in 1840, in the Elizabethan style. There are many other charities, educational and other wise, in the parish. The town-hall is a singular-looking edifice. In it the county assizes were formerly held, alternately with Lewes and East Grinstead. On the north side of what is still called Gaol-green stood in succession two prisons for criminals and debtors ; but in 1775 a new prison was erected eastward of the town, and this has also disappeared. The last execution took place at Horsham in 1844. In the 19th vol. of the \" Sussex Collections \" is an account of the most inhuman putting to death of a man who was accused of the murder of Elizabeth Symonds, of Bognor, in 1735. He was tried at the Lewes assizes; but being dumb, or pretending to be so, he did not plead either \"guilty\" or \"not guilty.\" He was therefore carried back to Horsham gaol, whence he had been brought, and pressed to death. The weight laid on the wretched man was 400 pounds, to which that of the executioner, who weighed 16 or 17 stone, was super-"], [291, "245 HORSHAM. added. This is supposed to be the last instance of \"pressing\" in England. Horsham, like most of the northern Sussex Weald, abounds with country residences and houses of more or less historical importance. To begin with, Chesworth was, from the 13th to the 15th century, the baronial abode of a branch of the De Braoses, who had an extensive manor. Both Edward I. and Edward II. , as before stated, visited that house. The history of the house and its occupants is fully given by Mr. W. D. Cooper, and Miss Hurst. The mansion was for the period a splendid build ing, and had a chapel of great importance, having been furnished, like the other principal rooms of the house, in a gorgeous man ner, with tapestry and other adornments. There were seventy four feather-beds. The history of -Chesworth during the owner ship of the De Braoses, Howards, and a Seymour, would fill a little volume ; but we must hasten onwards. Chesworth still retains traces of its moat and its chapel, ancl has, on the flooring of the cedar, the largest Horsham stones in Sussex. There are many old traditions connected with this house of supernatural sights and sounds, all pointing more or less to its ancient im portance and associations. The next noticeable residence is Denne Park, a beautiful house of mixed styles, ranging from the Stuart period downward. Its antique gables, fine Sussex chimneys, and above all its splendid avenue of lime trees, render it one of the most interesting and picturesque abodes in the county. Its deer park reaches the verge of the town, and the elevated site commands extensive views, especially over Horsham itself. The manor, which is a sub-infeudation of Washington, has passed through the families of De Braose, Booth, and Burn ham, to that of Eversfield, in each case by purchase. The first ofthe name of the present possessor was Sir Thomas Eversfield, who bought it in 1604. From him it descended to Sir Charles Eversfield, at the death of whose sister, Olive, it devolved on her nephew, William Mark wick, Esq., grandfather of Charles Gilbert Eversfield, Esq., the name having been changed by royal sign manual. Hill's Place, a fine Elizabethan house, situated to the west of the town, was pulled down in 1819. The mansion was named after the old Sussex family of Atte Hide. Its subsequent possessors were Copley, Caryll, Middleton, Ingram, and the Norfolk family. It was afterwards divided among several pro prietors. A house called North Chapel, on the north side ofthe town, built in the \" post and panel \" style, and used as cottages, is supposed to have been connected with one of the residences of the Hoo family, and a chapel probably stood near the spot. Near the church is a manor-house called Hewells, which be longed to Rusper Priory, and which for a century and a half"], [292, "246 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. was the residence of the Tredcroft family. The Tred crofts were at Horsham in 1558, and probably much earlier. Nathaniel Tredcroft was presented to the vicarage of Horsham by Oliver Cromwed, and his descendants intermarried with the heiresses of Scrase and Miched. Berry's Genealogies bring down the pedigree to 1828. The present possessor of Hewells is H. Pad wick, Esq. In a picturesque street called The Causeway is a building of the 16th century, for many generations the property of the Hurst family. Horsham Park is a brick-built mansion of about the beginning of the 18th century, but of somewhat different periods. It belonged to the family of Wicker. Upon the death of John Wicker, Esq., in 1767, it descended to his only daughter and heiress, who married Sir Thomas Broughton. The latter sold it to W. Smith, Esq., whose son sold it to Robert Hurst, Esq. The grounds contain fine timber. Springfield belongs to the Blunt family. Holbrook has passed by purchase from the families of Manley and Whitshed to W. R. Seymour Fitzgerald, Esq. On the north side of the parish is a moated residence, now a farm-house only, the property of R. H. Hurst, Esq., whose ancestors possessed it in the 15th century. Alkesborne, another property of Mr. Hurst, formerly belonged to the Tredcrofts. It was once a manor, and the house had a moat. Its proprietors were, in succession, Le Sauvage, NeviUe, Camoys, Lewknor, and Pelham. Coolkurst is a good specimen of modern Tudor architec ture, standing in ornamental grounds, about 1| mile east ofthe town. John Linfield, Esq., was formerly owner, and one of his descendants sold it, in 1807, to the Earl of Galloway, who greatly improved it. At a later date Lord Templemore sold it to the Dowager Marchioness of Northampton, whose daughter, Lady Ehzabeth Compton, married Charles Scrase Dickens, Esq., the present proprietor. Around the frieze at the top of the mansion is introduced, in old English characters, the opening verse of the 127th Psalm, in Latin, \" Except the Lord build the House,\" &c. Roughey Place was part of the estate of Lord Hoo. It passed, through female descendants, from that nobleman to the families of Copley, Weston, and Webb. John Webb, Esq., who took the name of Weston, sold it to Charles, Duke of Nor folk. The present house represents a small portion of the ancient mansion, which was so large as to enclose a quadrangle of 120 feet, and was surrounded by a moat. The manor is a sub-infeudation of Chesworth, and extends into the town of Horsham and the parish of Rusper. Roughey being remote from any church, a small iron edifice has been constructed for the inhabitants of the hamlet. Stammerham, now a farm-house, was in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries the abode of the"], [293, "247 HOESTED KEYNES. Miehells, a family of considerable importance, from whom the poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley, was maternally descended. The house was formerly much larger.

The suffix Keynes was given to distinguish it from the not far distant parish of Horsted Parva. The family of Cahanges, or Keynes, derived their name from Cahanges near Caen, and after the Conquest held large possessions in Sussex, Bucks, Devon, Dorset, and Wilts, in all which counties villages still retain the suffix of Keynes, indicating their pro prietorship. It is apparently the same name as Cheney, and Cane may be a contraction. According to Domesday, the Con queror gave Horstede, containing 5 hides and 3 roodlands, to the Earl of Moreton, which lands are said to have been held by Ralph, probably a son of the William de Cahanges who came over from Normandy at the Conquest. William de Cahanges confirmed lands and the advowson of Horstede to the Priory of Lewes, and it is supposed that the Prior had a residence here, with a chapel attached to it, as in 1312, the then prior dates a letter \" from the chapel of the Lord Prior of Lewes, at Horstede.\" Eventually the Sussex branch of this great family became ex tinct, and about the middle of the 13th century the heiress carried the estate into the family of Lewknor, whose descen dants held it for several generations. For an elaborate account of the Keynes family see vol. i. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" by W. S. Walford, Esq. Subsequently the principal manor passed to the Morley family, and followed the same descent as Glynde, the Right Honble. Henry Brand, M.P., being now lord. Portions of Broadhurst and other manors lie within the parish. Though Horsted-Keynes now boasts of no seat of importance, it formerly possessed several ; especially Trenmontes (vulgo Trimmens), for several generations the residence of the famdy of Wyatt, direct descendants of Sir Thomas Wyatt, who was beheaded in 1554 for his adherence to the Protestant cause against Mary ; Kenwardes, the seat of a branch of the Chaloners ; Broadhurst, originally the residence of the Lewknors ; and later of the Leighton family. The Valor Ecclesiasticus mentions a chantry at Brodehurst, which was probably identical with the chapel of the Prior of Lewes, before mentioned. Here in later times resided a branch of the Leighton family, and it was hither that Archbishop Leighton retired, temp. Charles IL, after his resignation of the see of Glasgow, and here he died. About a mile from the village is a chalybeate spring, caded the Holywell ; but there is no tradition concerning it. The church (St. Gdes) is cruciform, in the Early English and Decorated styles, with some indicia of earlier work. It is situated in a deep ded, so that the villagers can scarcely say, \" Let us go up to the House of the Lord.\" The tower at the west end is surmounted by a shingled spire, and forms a beautiful object in"], [295, "249 HORSTED PARVA. the landscape.

This building contains one of the most remarkable and interesting monuments in Eng land \u2014 a minia.ture effigy (27 inches long) of a knight in armour with a lion at his feet. It is beautifully executed, and belongs to the latter part of the reign of Henry III. or the beginning of Edward I. It probably commemorates one of the Keynes family ; but since \" monuments themselves memorials need,\" nothing certain is known on this subject. Archbishop Leighton was buried in the south transept beneath a marble slab, as was his brother Sir Ellis Leighton, but during alterations in the building some years since these slabs were removed from the transept and stuck in an upright position against the outside wall of the chancel. A few years since a more suitable memorial was placed here by the admirers of the memory of that admirable prelate, who after quitting Glasgow and settling at Horsted, preached here and in the surrounding villages, and spent most of his income in works of charity. He died in 1684, aged 74. There are other smad tablets and memorials to the famdies of Lightmaker, Pigott, Clark, Delamore, &c. Danehill is a hamlet in this parish, and has a district church. [S. A.

Horstede is described in Domesday as portion of the manor of Hame (Hamsey), some miles distant. It had always been exempt from land-tax, and consisted of 4 hides, the arable being eight plough-lands. In 22nd Edward I. Wdliam Dairy held the manor of the Honour of Pevensey, and it belonged subse quently to his descendant Robert ; but at the dissolution of the"], [296, "250 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. monasteries it belonged to Lewes Priory, and Henry VIII. granted it to his Vicar-general Cromwell. In 32nd of the same reign it vested in the family of Pope, of Hendall in Buxted. From the reign of Charles I. to 1723 it was in the family of Hay, previously of Tickeridge in Framfield, a branch of the Hays of Glyndebourne. Subsequently it passed in succession through the families of Beard, Nott, Herbert, and Law, to the father of the present possessor, Francis Barchard, Esq. The old house of the Hays, built about the year 1680, was pulled down about 25 years since, and the present very elegant man sion substituted. It is \" Tudoresque \" in style, contains many fine treasures of art, and commands most charming scenery over an extensive country, and beautifully wooded grounds. Another manor in the parish, called Worthe, had possessors of the same name in the 14th century. The church consists of nave, chancel, and Perpendicular west tower. From the leads of the latter the view over a large dis trict can hardly be excelled. On the north wall of the chancel is an arcade of extremely early character, the purpose of which is not apparent. The building has recently been restored in the best taste, by the patron of the benefice. It contains memorials of the families and names of Hay, Nott, Sergison, &c, and in the churchyard there was a curious stone slab of the date of 1502, to the memory of . . . Delve, a member of an old Horsted and Sussex family. There are three bells, one of which is dedicated to St. Katherine. [S. A. C. King Edward I. at, ii, 156. Worthe manor and family, xii, 36.

Clarkson, M.A., of Jesus College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1560. Acreage, 1,455. According to the Monasticon, Ceadwalla, King of the South Saxons, gave the manor of Houghton to Wilfred, Bishop of Selsey, in 673. It is not mentioned in Domesday, and hence Cartwright infers that it was included under Amberley. It was"], [297, "251 HOUGHTON. confirmed to the see of Chiehester by Henry 1., as also by Henry III. In 1810 the farm of Houghton Chapel, part of Houghton Forest, the parsonage of Houghton, a chalk-pit, and three copyhold estates in Houghton, within the manor of Amberley, were sold by the Bishop of Chiehester to Charles, Duke of Nor folk, and these are now added to the demesnes of Arundel Castle. The forest of Houghton was formerly of some impor tance, and in 1292 there was a violent dispute respecting hunt ing rights, between Leofard, Bishop of Chiehester, and Richard, Earl of Arundel, and the latter was condemned to a penance of three days, and a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Richard of Chiehester. The bishops had a claim of \" two bukkes a season\" from the forest or chase of Houghton. The ancient ferry of Houghton was replaced by a bridge for the convenience of the bishops on their way to their manor of Amberley, close by. The bridge, which is of considerable antiquity, and consists of several arches, was restored in 1440 and 1478, by Bishops Praty and Storey, the latter granting to all contributors to the pious work an indulgence of forty days from the pains of purgatory. On account of the importance of this bridge the river Arun was formerly known as \" Houghton Water.\" There was a manor within the boundary of the forest, and another, or perhaps the same, passed in 1428 from the Earl of Arundel to William Cheyney, Esq., as mesne lord. His grand son, Thomas Cheyney, died possessed of it in 1486. By some means it escheated to the crown, and in 1560 was leased to John CaryU, Esq. At a later date, 1649, it belonged to Sir Garret Kempe. In 1789 it was transferred by the heirs of James Butler, Esq., of Amberley Castle, to the late Charles, Duke of Norfolk. The benefice is a chapelry or vicarage, annexed to Amberley. The chapel, or church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, is described by Dallaway as \"very small and apparently ancient.\" A more recent authority says, \" a neat church has been erected in the Early English style at a cost of \u00a3693, by the Duke of Norfolk, and the incumbent, and a parish rate.\" There is an ancient slab of Sussex marble inlaid with a brass to djomas CtljfMgne and Anne his wife, 1486. Among the several recluses who chose the banks of the Arun for their abode there was at Houghton, in 1242, a Hermitess, to whom St. Richard of Chiehester be queathed a smad legacy. [S. A. C.

This village (or town) within the present century was an insignificant assemblage of huts, with a population of about 100. It had, however, been more important in earlier times before it was encroached upon by the sea. At present it is merely a western extension of Brighton, and possesses magni ficent squares, ranges of costly houses, and several churches. A portion of the parish has been ridiculously named Cliftonville. Hove, then called Hou, was part of the great possessions of Earl Godwin, and after the Conquest William Fitz-Bonard held it of William de Warenne. The Domesday account is very con fused. There appear to have been 14 villeins, 8 bondmen, ancl 6 salt pans. The value under the Confessor was \u00a34 and afterwards \u00a36. A certain knight held one hide. In the reigns of Edward I. and Edward III. a branch of the Pierpoint family seem to have been possessors. In 6th James I. the manor belonged to the Crown, and from 1638 to 1712 to the family of Scrase. Eliza beth, only child of William Scrase, married Nathaniel Tredcroft, Esq., of Horsham, in whose descendants it vested till the end of the last century, when it passed by sale to the family of Stan ford of Preston. There are two prebends in Chiehester Cathe dral, called respectively Hova Ecclesia and Hova Villa, the lands belonging to which lie in Hove and Bolney. Near the northern extremity of the parish in a valley of the Downs, called Gold stone Bottom, there stood, till about 1833, a large stone nearly seven feet in height, which had doubtless been sacred to Druidical rites, and was called the \" gold \" (qy. gorsed) stone. A utilitarian farmer, who deserves the execration of every lover of the past, dug a hole and buried this relic of unknown ages, because it hindered his plough a little ! Some arch\u00e6ologists wish he had been buried under it. To the north of this Celtic relic there were formerly several large stones, which were conjectured to have been Druidical also. The parish church (St. Peter) is about a quarter of a mile from the shore. A notice of the old building in the \" Gentleman's Magazine,\" 1792, represents it in a sorrowful condition, and we are told by the contributor that service was only performed once in six weeks. It was rebuilt in 1856, when a few of the Early"], [299, "253 HUNSTON. English features were preserved. The ancient altar-stone was found in clearing out the foundations of the chancel. There had been a tower, but it fell down, and the stones were carried to Goodwood, and there used for what Horsfield calls a \" modern antique.\" The several new churches which have been necessi tated by the growing population, are \u2014 St. John Baptist, Western Boad.

The former stood upon a rivulet which rises here and falls into the estuary of Pagham, where no doubt the salt-pans lay. At a later date the manor belonged to the families of De Albini, Earls of Arundel, De Monte Alto, and St. John. A family surnamed De Hunstaue held it in 1338 of John de St. John. Subse quently it has belonged, whody or in part, to Dawtrey, Palmer, and Bysshopp. The church (St. Leger) formerly contained a guild of Our Lady. As shown in Nibbs's \" Churches of Sussex,\" and as given in the \" Gentleman's Magazine \" for 1792, it must be reckoned among the meanest of ecclesiastical buildings.

The parish is so called in contradistinction to Hurst-Pier point, Hurst-Green, Hurst-Barns, &c. The chief object of attraction and interest in it is its Castle, erected in the year 1440, by Sir Roger de Fynes, at a cost of the then enormous sum of \u00a33,800. It is among the earliest brick buildings in England, and when in full repair was considered the largest private house in the kingdom. Its ancient accessory, a heronry, very rare in Sussex, still exists. A manor-house had previously occupied the site, and had been successively the seat of the families of De Herst, De Monceux, and Fynes or Fiennes, from the time of the Conquest. Sir Roger Fynes added to the park which had previously existed, 600 acres of land. His son Richard, who was sheriff * By a very recent alteration the centre of postal arrangements for the district has been transferred to Hawkhurst."], [301, "255 HURST-MMONCEUX. of Sussex in 1452, married Joan, heiress of Thomas Lord Dacre, and was, in her right, summoned to Parliament, and declared, in 1458, Baron Dacre of the South. Thomas, the second Lord Dacre, distinguished himself as a soldier, and was Constable of Calais. He died in 1534. His grandson and successor associates this place with a very tragical event. Engaging in the foolish and unlawful frolic of trespassing for venison in the park of his neighbour, Sir Nicholas Pelham, at Hel lingly, a fray took place between his companions and the Knight's gamekeepers, one of whom, John Busbrig, died of his wounds three days afterwards. For this Lord Dacre was held responsible, and was executed at St. Thomas Waterings, and three of the marauders, Mantel, Frowdes, and Roydon, were also put to death at Tyburn, near London. Several other gentlemen and yeomen escaped. It was long thought that Lord Dacre was more \" sinned against than sinning \" \u2014 (See Mrs. Gore's \" Dacre of the South,\" and my \" Contributions to Literature,\", pp. 74-84) \u2014 but from a document quoted in \" Sussex Collections,\" it is clear that the misguided young nobleman, as well as his reckless companions, was in a high degree culpable. Gregory, son of this unfortunate baron, succeeded to the title and estate, but died unmarried, and his sister Margaret, who married Sampson Lennard, Esq., was recog nized as Baroness Dacre. They resided much at Hurst-Mon ceux castle, and added greatly to its internal decorations. It remained in the Lennard family until the time of Thomas, Lord Dacre, who was created Earl of Sussex by Charles II. He im proved (!) the castle on the east side, by the addition of sash windows ; but losing great part of his estate by extravagance and gambling, was obliged to sed Hurst-Monceux. In 1708 the estate became the property of George Naylor, Esq., of Lincoln's Inn, who married a sister of Thomas Pelham, the great political Duke of Newcastle. His successor was his kinsman, Dr. Francis Hare, Bishop of Chiehester, who left the castle to his son Francis Naylor. In 1775 it devolved on his half-brother, the Rev. Robert Hare, but was then considered to be so ddapidated as to be past repair. The interior was consequently demolished, and the materials were employed in making an addition to Hurst- Monceux Place, a mansion on the same estate. This house, which was for some years the residence of the Chevalier Bunsen, contains some beautiful wood carvings by Grinling Gibbons. From F. Hare Naylor the estate passed by sale, in 1807, to Thomas Read Kemp, Esq., the founder of Kemp Town, Brighton. In 1819 it was purchased by the Gidon family. In 1846, John Gillon, Esq., M.P., sold it to H. Barrett Curteis, Esq., father of Herbert Mascall Curteis, Esq., the present owner."], [302, "256 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The Castle, even in ruins, is one of the grandest buildings in the South of England. It is quadrangular in form, and sur rounded by a moat, now dry. A walnut avenue, of great anti quity, leading to its embattled entrance, is now in a state of decay. The building is among the latest specimens of a castle, properly so called, possessing much ofthe grandeur, with little of the strength of the feudal fortresses of earlier times. Its features are well known to most architectural antiquaries, and it is with out doubt the most picturesque building in Sussex. The gate way is particularly grand. Addison's comedy, \"The Drummer, or the Haunted House,\" is supposed to be based upon a tradition connected with this castle. The room immediately over the porter's lodge was known as the Drummer's Had, from the loud \" spirit-rapping \" formerly car ried on there. The tradition is that the Drummer, with his nightly tattoo, kept the country round in a state of alarm. The Drummer was stated to be nine feet high, and to be seen straddling along the battlements at a furious rate. Addison, however, assures us, on the authority of the butler addressing the coachman, that he was never apparent except \"in the shape of the sound of a drum ! \" Mr. Hussey says, \" the church (All Saints) has been much altered, but the nave and tower appear to be Early English. On the north side of the chancel, under an arch opening into a private chapel, is a richly-ornamented altar- tomb, with two re cumbent effigies, namely, those of Thomas Fynes, second Lord Dacre [of the South], and his son Thomas, who died before him.\" The date is ofthe time of Henry VEIL (1533.) There is also a brass to tbeir ancestor, <_t2UiUiam fftndfg (so spelt) (Eijjcbalcr. The other memorials are chiefly of modern date, and of no special interest. Some restorations were made a few years since, during the incumbency of the late Rev. Charles Julius Hare, Archdeacon of Lewes, a man well-known for his eminent literary talents, and devotion to the interests of truth. A very interesting account of Hurst-Monceux was printed in \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" vol. iv., by the Rev. Edmund Venables, when curate of the parish.

This pleasant town-village and its parish have had an able exponent in W. Smith Edis, Esq. ; first in a smad work printed by him in 1837, and afterwards in an elaborate memoir, man- orial, ecclesiastical, and genealogical, in the \" Sussex Codec- tions,\" vol. xi. The parish derives its name from the Ano-fo- Saxon hyrst, a wood, with the suffix Pierpoiut, from the old Norman family of De Petro Ponte, or Pierpoint, a presumed offshoot of the potent race of De Warenne, lords of the barony and rape of Lewes. Domesday informs us that Herst, in the hundred of Botingelle, was held by Earl Godwin, and assessed at 41 hides. This large territory lay chiefly in the rape of Lewes; but extended into those of Bramber and Pevensey. There were 35 villeins, a church, 8 ministri, 3 mills, and a wood of 50 hogs. Robert held it of William de Warenne, and it was estimated at \u00a312. Mr. Edis considers the manor as one of the largest, if not the largest, hi Sussex held by a mesne tenant ; but several sub-infeudations or minor manors were doubtless carved out of it in the lapse of time. Some of these, as How- court in.Lancing, as wed as Pakyns and Hautbois in the parish, have been pretty wed determined. The Pierpoints, who appear to have held Hurst for several centuries, were raised in later times to the peerage, the last male heir having been Evelyn, Duke of Kingston, who died in 1773. An old speding of the parish was Perpondes-herst. The lords of Hurst who imme- diately succeeded the Pierpoints after 9th Henry VI. (1431) are not ascertained ; but it would appear that in or before 1463 the famdy of Fynes, afterwards Lords Dacre of Hurst-Monceux, were in possession. The manor house and deer park were situated to the north of the church. There were indeed, at a later period, three parks in the parish, known as Great Park Little Park, and Danny Park, the last only of which is now existing. In 1582 Gregory, Lord Dacre, conveyed to George s"], [304, "258 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Goring, of Lewes, Esq., the manor of Hurst-Pierpoint, and in that branch of the Gorings, afterwards ennobled as Barons Goring and Earls of Norwich, it continued for some time. In 1652 Peter Courthope, of Cranbrook, Esq., purchased this and other manors of the Earl of Norwich, as also Danny. His grandson of the same name, dying in 1724, his daughter and heiress carried Danny to her husband, Henry Campion, of Combwed, in Kent, Esq., ancestor in the fourth degree of the late William John Campion, Esq., whose son is the present possessor of the estate. Besides other manors extending into this and neighbouring parishes, special mention must be made of the subordinate manor of Pakyns. Mr. Ellis thinks it de rives its name from Paganus, sheriff of Sussex in 1157, whose name occurs in documents with Pierpoint, De Kaines, De Chilt ington, and other Sussex famdies of the 12th century. In the reign of Edward VI. Richard Holden, of Hurst-Pierpoint by his will, proved in 1553, left his estate to three co heiresses, of whom Agnes married John Fynes of Claverhain, in Arlington. The next known owner is Richard Scrase, of Pangdean and Hurst, who left it in 1730 to Richard Whitpayne, of Hurst. It has subsequently passed through the names of Butcher and Soale to the family of Borrer, the present possessors. The mansion of Danny, in its beautiful park, possesses consi derable historical importance. Sir Simon de Pierpoint, in 1355, received from the king a license to enclose his woodlands and his domain called Danye, in Sussex, granted to him by the Earl of Surrey (i. e. the Earl of Warenne). There was an earlier mansion in the park than that which now exists. The present Elizabethan house, one of the finest in the range of grand family mansions which skirt the northern escarpment of the South Downs, was built in 1595, by George Goring, Esq., for merly of Ovingdean, son of Sir William Goring of Burton. It is one of the fairest of its type, and presents a grand front of large extent. It contains some excellent portraits and other pictures. Behind the house, on a fine sweep of the Downs, is an ancient circular earthwork, doubtless of Celtic date, though its present name, Wolstonbury (Wulfstan-byrig), would imply that one Wulfstan, doubtless a Saxon chief, afterwards held it. The park contains some noble oaks and other trees. Hurst was the residence of the late Richard Weekes, Esq., F.S.A., a learned arch\u00e6ologist, who formed a valuable collection of local antiquities. Hurst \" College \" is a large establishment for the education of middle-class boys, in what are called \" high church \" principles. There are several hundreds of pupils at the rate of \u00a318 18s. per annum. (Murray.) The old church (St. Laurence) consisted of a nave, south aisle,"], [305, "259 ICKLESHAMM. a small north transept, and two chancels, the one which ranged with the south aisle being known as the Danny chancel. At the west end stood a large square tower with a shingled spire. This old building was replaced by another in the Decorated style, about thirty years since, from the designs of Sir Charles Barry, and cost \u00a37,000. The tower contains eight bells, and there is a small sanctus bed on the east gable of the nave. In the south transept is a shattered cross-legged effigy, in chain armour, with shield and sword. This was doubtless for a Pier point. Another Pierpoint monument is also preserved with a recumbent effigy, on an altar tomb, supposed to be for Simon de Pierpoint of the time of Edward III. There are more recent memorials for different families. One of these is for Christopher Swale, D.D., who had been tutor to Prince Henry, son of James I., ejected from this rectory for siding with the Royalists ; he died in 1643. The others commemorate individuals of the families of Courthope, Campion, Beard, Borrer, Roberts, &c. In addition to the families already referred to, several others of gentle position are, or have been, connected with the parish, particularly Whitpaine, Luxford, Norton, Wickham, Beard, Dodson, Borrer, Weekes, and Marshall.

It is of undulated surface, and commands, from several points, interest ing prospects, especially from White-hart hill. It is bounded on the east by the English Channel and Rye Harbour. At the latter place a considerable population has sprung up, so as to necessitate the erection of a new church (the Holy Spirit) for the convenience of outlying parishioners, and the seamen who visit the port. The low grounds on the east side of the parish, called the Pewes, are supposed to have been formerly overflowed by the sea, and the discovery of an anchor and the remains of a ship support the opinion. In the 13th century, these lands were called the New-marsh, implying that they had not long been reclaimed from the sea. The manor of Icklesham is not found in Domesday, but it probably formed part of the mysteri ous manor of Rameslie, which has caused antiquaries so much trouble.* At later dates, however, the manor of Icklesham is recognized, and it was held of the barony of Hastings with a payment of 18s. for castle-guard rent. The manor lies in the parishes of Icklesham, Ore, Fairlight, Pett, and Guestling, and the waste of the manor is still claimed by the lord of the barony. This manor gave name to a considerable family caded De Ickle sham. In 11th Henry III. Sybilla, daughter and heiress of Ralph de Dene (of Westdean, near Seaford),had a chancery suit against Sybilla de Dene, mother of Ralph de Icklesham, for per mitting Robert de Dene, Ralph's brother, to encroach on her manorial rights. The De Icklesham family soon died out, and this Sybilla carried the estate, by marriage, to Nicholas Herin god, or Heringaud, whose successors were influential in East Sussex for several generations. They were succeeded, temp. Edward III., by the Finches (olim Herbert), ancestors of the Earls of Winchelsea and Nottingham, who held it for many genera tions. In 1741 the Countess of Winchelsea held the manor and demesnes, but they were afterwards sold to Sir Richard Lloyd, Knight, Solicitor General to George IL, and Mrs. Daly. From them it was purchased by the family of Nesbitt, whose estates, including the manor and the New Place estate, were purchased by Thomas Cooper, Esq., but passed in 1815 to the Brisco family, and they now belong to C. Hay Frewen, Esq., M.P. The manor of Snaylham was portion of the possessions of Battle Abbey, and afterwards belonged to the family of Cheyney. A tradition states that the families of Cheyney and Oxenbridge of Brede place were at perpetual variance, and that once a party of the Cheyneys surprised an Oxenbridge in his bed, and slew him. The heiress of John Cheney married Sir Thomas Culpeper, of * See Frant"], [307, "ICKLESHAM. 261 Hollingbourne in Kent, and by her had a son, Sir Cheney Cul peper. The estate passed by subsequent sales to the families of Munn, Offley, Shore, Curteis, Cooper of New Place, and Lang ford of Udimore. \" The remains of the Cheyney residence,\" says Horsfield, 1835, \" are very visible, and the tenants of it and of its manor have ever since been recognized in the parish by the appellation of Squire Cheney's.\" On the north side of the parish formerly stood Old Place, the seat of a branch of the Finches, afterwards ennobled as Earls of Winchelsea. It was pulled down in the 1 7th century, and a new residence called New Place was built with the materials. It is now a farmhouse. In 23rd Edward I. William de Echyngham had lands (and freewarren) here, as also had the New Priory of Hastings (at Warbleton). The latter were granted, after the dissolution of that house, to John Baker, Esq., Attorney-General to Henry VIII. Grafherst, or Grofherst in this j^arish gave name to the fainily of De Graf hurst, who were benefactors to Battle, as were several other inhabitants of Icklesham. (Hayley's MSS., British Museum, and Thorpe's Catalogue of Battle Abbey Charters.) In 25th Henry VIII. Henry Hatch, merchant-adventurer, ancl jurat of Faversham, bequeathed to the mayor, jurats, and commonalty of that town for ever, the farm called Brook in Icklesham, for the three-fold purpose of maintaining the haven, the highways, and the ornaments of the church. Brook farm now realizes upwards of \u00a3500 per annum. Knockbridge, another farm in Icklesham, gave name to its ancient proprietors. The family of Cooper were of Icklesham Place for at least six gene rations. John Cooper, Esq., died in 1624. His descendants, in two branches, settled at Lewes in the last century, and W. Durrant Cooper, Esq., F.S.A., the well-known Sussex antiquary, wed represents the name. The town of New Winchelsea was built on a dismembered portion of this parish, called Petit Higham. Camber, or Win chelsea Castle, also stands within its limits. See Winchelsea. The great tithes of the parish belong to the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, and are leased for twenty-one years. The tenant for the time being is liable to the charge of entertaining for two days the Dean in person, his horse, and his receiver or surveyor. This singular liability is now commuted for a money paynnent of 40s. The Church (St. Nicholas ?) is popularly ascribed to Agnes Morley, in the fourteenth century ; but this is absurd, as the main part of the building is unquestionably Norman, and one of the best specimens of that styde in East Sussex. It consists of nave, with aisles, a spacious rectorial chancel, flanked on each side"], [308, "262 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. with a manorial chancel or chantry. The nave pidars have enriched capitals, and in the south aisle are three round-headed windows. There are several niches and piscin\u00e6. The tower stands in the middle of the north aisle, and contains three bells. The east window is of the Early Decorated style. The church has been restored. In the south chancel there was an altar tomb of Sussex marble, without effigy or inscription, but attri buted to Henry Fynche (1493), who by his will directs his body to be buried in the chapel of St. Nicholas, and orders an altar to be built therein, like that of the high altar of the church. This tomb was wholly removed during the \" restorations \" (?) in 1847. Alack for church restorers I There are tablets and slabs for the families and names of Nesbitt, Cooper of New Place, Collins, Odiarne, Richards, Stobart, Beale, &c, and in the church-yard there are tombs for the families of Cooper and Harman.

The original document in the possession of the Pix family is engraved in sac-simile in Holloway's History of Romney Marsh. The house or fortalice has long been removed, but the moat remains. At a later date it belonged to the famdy sur named De Iden, of which Alexander Iden, who slew Jack Cade in 1450, was a member. (See Heathfield.) A chantry was attached to this manor. Oxenbridge, now a farm-house, gave name to a celebrated family afterwards settled at Brede, Win chelsea, &c, and stid existing in the United States.

The church (Ad Saints) consists of two chancels, a nave with aisles, and a western tower, with stair-turret. \" In this edifice the pointed style prevails, although there are several semi-circular arches in the south wall.\" (Horsfield.) There is a brass for MialtCt pellet, rector, 1427, and memorials for Martin, &c.

A heronry existed at Iden, in 1297, and belonged to the Crown. When I visited this village in 1833, 1 found in the chantry chapel or chancel, a worthy person, Mr. Winser, teaching the village school.

It was rated at one hide. There were five villeins, four bondmen, and a wood for the pannage of six hogs. The early"], [310, "264 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. history of the manor is very obscure, being often confounded with Isfield in Lewes rape. In 1211 Henry de Falkington held a* knight's fee here, and in 1317 John de Ifeld held the manor. In the early part of the reign of Charles I. it was part of the grand estate of the Coverts of Slaugham, and they sold it to Denzd Holies, Esq., who, after the Restoration of Charles II. was created Baron Hodes of Ifield. From him it descended to the Pelhams, and Thomas Pelham, Esq., sold it in 1786, to Thomas Dennet, Esq., whose second daughter conveyed it by marriage to the noble family of. Rodney, the present possessors. The demesne lands consist of Ifield Court, Ewhurst Place, Lang leys, &c. Cartwright gives several interesting transfers of lands in the parish during the fourteenth century, with various seals attached to the deeds. (\" Rape of Bramber,\" p. 382.) The impropriation was in the hands of the neighbouring priory of Rusper, and was granted at the dissolution of that establishment to Sir Robert Southwell, Master of the Rolls. Subsequently it passed to the families of Peck, Spencer, and Lewin. Some curious particulars as to the claims of the nuns of Rusper upon the church emoluments of Ifield in 1247, are given in Cartwright's \"Rape of Bramber.\" The Non\u00e6 return of 1341 shows the long retention of names as connected with locahties. The four witnesses in this record are Peter de Stum belhole, Richard at Wode, Adam Goffe, and Henry de Langle. The names Stumblehole, Ifield Wood, Goff's Hill, and Langleys, still indicate places in this parish. The church (St. Margaret?) consists of nave, aisles, and chan cel, originally Early English, but with many alterations of later date. The pitch of the roof is unusually lofty, and it has been supposed to be the work of a foreign architect. At the west end is a low wooden turret. On the west side of the nave, on an altar-tomb, ornamented with quatrefoils containing roses, is a recumbent effigy of a cross-legged knight, with a sword and smad shield, and with a lion at his feet. On the opposite side of the nave, on an altar-tomb, is an effigy of a lady, her head supported by angels, and a lion at her feet. These interesting memorials are supposed to be those of Sir John de Ifield, who died in 1317, and his wife. There are inscriptions for the names and families of Seyliard, Lewin, Spencer, Peck, Allen, Gale, Makerith, Holies or Hodis, &c. There are two beds. [S. A. C. Ironworks, ii, 211. iii, 243. v, 66.

Iford is supposed to be identical, though not co-extensive, with the Domesday Niworde, which before the Conquest had been the estate of Edith, the neglected Queen of Edward the Confessor, and which must have been afterwards a valuable acquisition both to the Earls of Warenne and the Priors of Lewes, as its annual rental amounted to \u00a335. The manor of Iford passed successively to De Plaiz, Mowbray, Fitz- Alan, and the Priory of Lewes. Temp. Elizabeth, the Lewknors had it. Good lands here belonged for some generations to the Ades, and came by marriage to the Hurlys. Of the latter family Mrs. Rosseter is the representative. Swanborough was an ancient Grange of the Priory of Lewes, and passed after the dissolution to the Caryds, and then to the Sackvides, to whose noble descendants it now belongs. The house possesses many features of antiquity, including a chapel, which is mentioned by Bishop Seffrid in 1200. There are re mains of Early English architecture, with many alterations of the Perpendicular period. The Grange, now occupied as a farm house, commands a delightful view of Lewes and the surround ing country. Horsfield mentions some remains of an ancient building at Iford, fancifully supposed to be the temple of a Saxon goddess called Niorde. The church is a smaU but interesting structure of Norman date, comprising nave, central tower, resting upon four semi circular arches, and chancel. The transepts, if any existed, have been removed. The building has been carefully restored. There are three ancient beds inscribed to St. Botulph, St. Katherine, and St. Margaret, and memorials to the names of Hurly, Carter, &c. On the removal of the plaster, it was discovered that a north aisle had formerly existed, and the arches have been disclosed. The chancel, which was restored in 1868 by Mrs. Rosseter, the lay impropriatress, now displays three early Norman windows, and other interesting features, and the windows are filled with excedent painted glass.

The parish is, remarkable for its length, six miles from north to south, whde its average breadth does not exceed half a mile. The village is situated in a retired valley, near the Rother. At the Conquest the manor was held by Aldred, and then contained, inter alia, a church, a mill, and a stone-quarry, the last producing 9s. 4d. yearly. It passed in successive ages to the families of Amundevide, Musard, Husee, and Audley. It was purchased in 1784 by G. O'Brien, Earl of Egremont, but re-sold to Lord Robert Spencer, about 1800. It afterwards belonged to Sir Charles Hamilton, Bart. Fitz- Hall, now modernized, was built in the reign of Elizabeth, by Christopher Bettesworth, and continued the residence of his posterity for five generations, when Anne, daughter and heiress of Peter Bettesworth, wife of Thomas Riggs of Hodist, having died without issue, the property passed to the Piggotts of Stedham, descended from a second marriage of the widow of the said Peter. In this parish was, till lately, a large paper mid, sup posed to occupy the site of the Domesday mill. The church (St. Mary) had Norman traces in 1830. It has since been rebuilt with a nave, chancel, transepts, and tower, and may fairly take rank among the ugliest of modern churches. [S. A. C. Domesday watermill, v, 271. Church, xii, 73.

Chief Landowners, Henry King, Esq., of Isfield Place. Thomas Browne, Esq., has a delightful residence called Buckham Hill. This parish is prettily seated, for the most part on low ground, on the Uckfield tributary of the river Ouse, from which river it doubtless derives the first syllable of its name \u2014 Ouse, Isis, Iser, Isca, Usk, &c, being common names of rivers, from a Celtic root, widely scattered over Europe, and signifying water. The Domesday scribes, who invariably mis-spelt the names of manors, wrote this place \" Sifelle.\" It had been held in Saxon times as free land by Godwin, father of Harold, with a taxation of six hides. At the date of the survey the arable was 11 plough lands. Of the descent of the manor little is now known, except that it had belonged to the family of Lord la Warre and their successors 1284 \u2014 1425, until the acquisition thereof by the family of Shurley, commonly, but erroneously, supposed to be a branch of the Shirleys of Wiston, originally descended from the very ancient house of Shirley of Eatington, in Warwick shire. They were, however, connected by marriage with the Wiston family. The Rev. Edward Turner has given, in vol. xviii. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" an interesting account of the old mansion called Isfield Place, and the Shurley family. The house was formerly very large, and had an enceinte with several towers, more for ornament than defence. A portion of the moat remains, probably belonging to a more ancient struc ture. The existing building appears to be not older than the time of Elizabeth or James I. It has a picturesque porch with stone pillars, with the legends, Abstinete and Sustinete, and the motto : \u2014 \"Non minor est virtus quam querere parta tueri,\" which Horsfield freely translates by our old English proverb : \" Catch is a good dog, but Hold-fast is a better.\" The church comprises western tower, nave, chancel, and a southern projection called the Shurley chapel. The architecture is for the most part Decorated, but there are some traces of Early English. In the chancel there are an extraordinarily large piscina, under a canopy, and two sedilia. In the north wall is a \" founder's tomb,\" or Easter sepulchre. The Shurley chapel contains some very interesting memorials of that famdy. The oldest formerly had brasses, the figures of which have been torn away, though an inscription remains informing us that the monument was erected for \" Mr. John Shurley, Esquier,\" who held the office of chief clerk of the kitchen to Henry VII., and cofferer to Henry VIII., and died in 1527. Another monument,"], [314, "268 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. likewise partly despoiled of its brass, commemorates Edward Shurley, the next possessor of the estate, who died in 1579. But the most attractive monument is a large canopied altar tomb of excellent workmanship to Sir John Shurley (ob. 1631), with recumbent figures of himself and his two wives, and kneel ing effigies of his nine children. Sir John's first wife was Jane, daughter of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, and his second Dorothy, daughter of George Goring, Esq., of Danny, and widow of Sir Henry Bowyer, of Cuckfield. Of the latter the epitaph records that she possessed \" a merite beyond most of her time ; for her purse was open to a prophet's name ; her pitty was the clothing of the poore ; her piety the mother of her practice ; her devotions were her daily offerings to God ; her mercy sure against condemnation ; and all her minutes were but steppes to heaven.\" Sir John Shurley bequeathed Isfield to his nejdiew Robert, son of his younger brother, Sir George Shurley, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, who has a plain tomb in the chancel, with the date 1647. The Isfield estate continued in this distinguished family till 1667, when it descended through female heirs by partition to the Radcliffes and to Sir James Smith, Lord Mayor of London, created a baronet as \" of Isfield,\" which title subsisted until 1811. The Radcliffe family disposed of the manor about the beginning of the present century to the family of King, Henry King, Esq., being the present owner. In this parish is a manor-pound with lancet openings, probably the oldest in the county. It was in Isfield church that the tomb of Gundrada, daughter of William the Conqueror, originally placed in Lewes Priory, and probably brought hither by John Shurley, Esq., was dis covered by the Rev. William Clarke, rector of Buxted, in 1775. (See Lewes.) It had formed the base of the tomb of Edward Shurley, but why the tombstone of a princess should have sup ported that of a country squire it is hard to conjecture. In this parish the tributary of the Ouse, known as the Uck field river, joins the main stream, and there is a tradition simi lar to those of Echingham and Bosham, of a sunken bell at the point of confluence.

A late account describes the building as of the twelfth century, with Norman work, an elegant spire, and a musical peal of five beUs. Cartwright's account, 39 years ago, is very different. It is, he says, \" a single nave of no greater antiquity than the age of Edward IV. or Henry VI.

Harewick or Harrick Bottom (perhaps from the Anglo-Saxon here and wie \u2014 the stronghold of an army) has conspicuous marks of an ancient camp. The manor has been successively in the families of St. Clere, Parker, and Spencer, Earl of Wdmington. From the last-mentioned it has passed to the Duke of Devonshire. Jevington Rectory is also a manor. The manor-house has some marks of antiquity. Wan nock was the seat of the family of Rochester, and at Filching there is a fine old timbered house. James Lambert, the wed knowu local artist, who so copiously illustrated the researches of Sir Wdliam Burred, was born at Jevington in 1725. (\" Sussex Worthies,\" p. 39.) The church (St. Andrew) has a nave, with north aisle and chancel. A massive square tower at the west end has very ancient, and I think, pre-Norman, features. Affixed to the east wall of the tower, inside, is a very rude early carving, about two feet in height, representing our Saviour bruising the head of the serpent \u2014 probably Anglo-Saxon art. There are memorials for the names of Markwick, Eversfield, Rochester, Mamiingham, Collier, &c. One of the bells is inscribed to St. Katherine. [S. A. C. Manor-rents, xiv, 263.

Domesday, Chemer ; vulgo, Kymer ; a parish in the Hundred of Butting- hill ; Bape of Lewes ; distant ten miles north from Brighton. Post- town, Hurst-Pierpoint. It has two stations ofthe Brighton and South Coast railway, viz., Hassock's Gate and Burgess Hill. Union, Cuck- field. Population in 1811, 536j at present, upwards of 2,000. Bene- fice, a Perpetual Curacy annexed to the rectory of Clayton ; Patron, Brasenose College ; Incumbent, the Ven. James Garbett, M.A., Archdeacon of Chiehester. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1601 ; Acreage, 3,538. This formerly obscure little village has risen, in conse quence of railway communication between London and Brighton, to be a place of rising population and importance. The prin cipal points are St. John's Common and Burgess-hill, formerly by-words, but now the favourite retreats of the prosperous traders of Brighton, who have handsome villa residences here. The parish is long and narrow, and commands, from various points, picturesque views of the South Down range of hills, near whose foot it stands, and over the adjacent Wealden district. At the date of Domesday, William de Wateville held Chemer. The powerful and ubiquitous Azor had held it of the Confessor. It contained fourteen hides, and the arable was twenty-five plough lands. There were 36 villeins and eleven bondmen, a church, three ministri, forty acres of meadow, two mills, and seven houses in Lewes. Before the Conquest the manor was estimated at \u00a314, but at the time of the Survey at \u00a312. It passed like Clayton, from the De Warennes to the Fitz-Alans. On the attainder of Richard, Earl of Arundel, in 1397, it was forfeited to the Crown, but was restored to his family on the accession of Henry VI. After many changes of proprietorship of no historical interest, it passed to the family of Cook, and was successively purchased by the Chatfields and Bayntuns. The manor extends into the somewhat remote parishes of Balcombe, Bolney, Worth, and Cuckfield. The manor courts were held at Brookland, an old farm-house on Valebridge or Walbridge Common. One of the Domesday mills which stood near the source of the stream issuing from the chalk-hill, no longer exists. Valebridge appears to represent the other mill, and there is a large pond, formerly perhaps connected with iron works. About half a century ago the pond bay gave way, and rushed through the mill-house, which stood at a lower level, carrying everything before it, including a bed upon which a woman was lying. Happily this singular voyage was impeded by some great branches of trees, which stopped the vessel, and the passenger escaped without detriment !"], [323, "3 KEYMER. The manor of Ockley belonged, temp . Henry in., to Nicholas de Hogan, by the service of half a knight's fee and three barbed arrows, payable to the barony of Lewes. In the early part of the seventeenth century it was the property of George Luxford, Esq., whose descendants possessed it for several generations. Ultimately it passed to the ancient Sussex family of Wood, and is now the property of James Wood, Esq. The estate called Oldland was purchased in 34th Henry VIIL, ofthe Michelbornes, by John Turner, whose descendants were connected, through many generations, with this parish and Ditchling, and are now somewhat widely dispersed through the county. The church (the dedication of which I cannot ascertain) is thus described by Mr. Hussey (1852). It consists of \" chancel, nave, south porch, and west tower. The chancel is apsidal, not merely rounded at the extremity, but the curve commences from the junction of the nave. The chancel arch is round, the piers being square blocks of masonry, with abaci at the spring of the arch. One small Norman window is visible, though closed ; the others are Decorated insertions. The tower, which, with the rest of the building, has been greatly patched and plastered, is in two stages, the lower Norman,\" and the upper, apparently of later date, yet early. The low shingled spire is a curious piece of work, as if one had been capped over by another. I have seen such instances in Normandy, but never elsewhere in Eng land. So much for the building in 1852 ; but since that time nearly the whole edifice has been re-constructed, after the modern taste, with several additions and much ornamentation, concerning which one may say, \" De gustibus,\" &c. However, it is a handsome little edifice, and reflects credit on the architect, Mr. E. E. Scott. There are inscriptions to the memory of the families of Luxford and Plumer. A new district church (St. John) was erected for the accommodation of the parishes of Clayton and Keymer, in 1863. The benefice is in the patronage of the rector, the Incumbent being the Rev. George Kirk Weston, M.A. From the name of St. John's Common in this parish, it is presumed that a chapel with that dedication formerly existed there. Gault prevails in this parish, and excellent bricks and pottery are made ; and there is a large annual fair for sheep, &c, which is known in the vernacular as \" St. Joneses fair.\" [S. A. C.

It lies chiefly on the South Downs, from the highest point of which, in this range, is a magnificent view over the north-east portion of the county. Kingston, though traditionally deriving its name from the Saxon Kings, is not mentioned in Domesday. The church is named in a charter of Bishop Seffrid, about the year 1200; and in 1397 Richard II. granted the manor to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, and it was afterwards held by the Priory of Lewes until the Dissolution. After the attainder of Thomas, Lord Cromwell, it was held by the Crown until about 28th Elizabeth, when it was in the hands of Sir Philip Sydney, who left it to his daughter, Elizabeth, Countess of Rutland. In the 17th century it belonged to the Vinalls, and at a later period to Robert Maitland, Esq., from whom it passed by sale to the Gorings of Wiston. The manor-house is ancient, apparently of the Early English period ; but it has been much mutilated within the last few years.* The church, which belongs to the early part of the 14th century, and which was much injured by light ning in 1865, consists of a nave, chancel, and a very small square tower, with a tiled roof. It has three bells, two of which are ancient, and inscribed respectively to St. Mary and St. Anne. It contains memorials of the family of Vinall, and in the church-yard are others for those of Zouch,f Ade, Glover, Rogers, &c. In a lane leading from the village to Ashcombe there is a sand-pit, a habitat of the sand-martin, rare in this district ; and near it is a kind of tumulus, called \"Nan Kemp's grave.\" There is a tradition that this \"Nan,\" whoever she was, murdered her infant, committed suicide, and was buried in this \" crossways.\" [S.

(\" Churches,\" p. 246) has given so excellent an account of this place, that I shall content myself with an abstract of his article : \u2014 \" Great part of this parish, tbe church included, appears to have been absorbed by the sea. It is now, though nominady a rectory, annexed to the vicarage and parish of Ferring. The old register still exists, reaching from a.d. 1570 to 1660, after which date there is no*further entry, whence we may conjecture that the church ceased to be used in 1661. The register is styled that of the chapel of Kingston. In the remaining portion of this parish near the sea, the Vicar of Ferring possesses about 1^ acre of glebe, which has been suggested as the pos sible site of the destroyed church ; but no foundations or vestiges of masonryr are visible in the field. A map of the early part of the 17th century shows ' Kingston Chapel,' and a similar entry occurs in Hondius' map of 1610, and in Kip's and Cam den's. A tradition of the country points out certain rocks in the sea, below high-water mark, as the site of the church. It is more probable that it stood in the neighbourhood of the field above-mentioned, where, on each side of the road, it is quite evident there were formerly several houses.\" Thus, as at Cudlow, Middleton, Selsey, and many other parishes, the sea, restrained within no fixed limits, has gradually eaten away our southern coast \u2014 \" And fishes swim where birds were wont to sing.\" KINGSTON BOWSEY.

In the north wall of the chancel is a recessed tomb of about 1500 \u2014 probably of a Lewknor, whose arms occur in an adjoining window, and also on the rood-screen. The tower, which is vaulted, stands between the nave and the chancel, and a dilapi dated north aisle was removed in the last century.

This, as will be seen by the figures above, is a very large parish. It is also historically interesting and important. In 519 Cerdic, founder ofthe West-Saxon kingdom, fought a great battle with the Britons, at a place called in the Saxon Chronicle Cerdices-ford. Mr. Hussey (p. 247) thinks this conflict occurred here\u2014 sed dubito, as Charford in Hampshire"], [327, "KIRDBORD. 7 seems to have a superior claim. The soil is generally a stiff clay, and there is much rough, heathy land, with coppice and timber. Sussex marble, a geological deposit of fresh water shells, imbedded in petrified mud, and called Petworth marble, Laugh ton marble, &c, is quarried in its best condition in this parish. It appears in many churches and mansions in Sussex, and is the finest stone, when properly polished, that the county can pro duce. The Archbishop's chair at Canterbury is composed of it. Some of the slabs of this beautiful material dug up in this parish have been three feet thick and seven feet long. Kirdford does not occur in Domesday, eo nomine; but in the reign of Henry I., one of the sons of Roger de Montgomeri, Earl of Arundel and Chiehester, endowed the abbey of Seez in Nor mandy with the church of Kuerdford. The principal manor in the parish is Schullinglegh, or Shil linglee, which was attached to the Honour of Arundel, and the Earls had a great park here. When Henry VIII. made forced exchanges with his subjects about 1542, the Crown- j>arker, Richard Bowyer, got possession, and Shillinglee was annexed to the Honour of Petworth ; but it was afterwards re-annexed to the Arundel estate. In 1616, Thomas, Earl of Arundel, sold the manor to Gerard Gore, Alderman of London, for \u00a34,587. His heiress, Sarah, married Sir Edward Tumour, Chief-baron of the Exchequer, of an ancient Suffolk family, dating from temp. Henry IV. The second son of this marriage established himself at Shillinglee, and ultimately the estate was transmitted through a female line to Edward Tumour Garth, Esq. In 1581 the park of Shillinglee is described as being six miles in compass within the pale, and a right is recognized that the farmer of the par- sonage should have, in a \" mast year \" (i.e., when acorns were plentiful), the right of feeding 30 hogs, or more, for seven weeks. The house and park of Shillinglee are situated in the northern part of the parish. The mansion was budt in the early part of the 18th century, and in 1778 the first Earl of Winterton added a south front, with an elegant vestibule and several excel- lent rooms. The present Earl of Winterton, fourth in descent from the first peer, possesses a large portion of the great tithes. The house is surrounded by very picturesque forest scenery, and there is a lake of 70 acres. Including Ash Park, King's Park, &c, the ring fence comprises more than six thousand acres. Another considerable estate in Kirdford is Pleistow, or Plat- stow, parcel of the manor of Slyndon, once belonging to the see of Canterbury, and it is said that the Archbishops occasionally retired hither, and had a private oratory. (Dallaway.) This estate has descended in the same line as Slyndon. A large farm and estate at Playstow belonged for several generations to the families of Steere and Lee."], [328, "8 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Hibernow, Ibeenhoo, or Ebeenowe, a very ancient manor, was attached to the Honour of Arundel. Henry VIII., in one of his forced exchanges \u2014 that made with William, Earl of Arundel \u2014 seized this manor. The Crown retained it tid 1592. It afterwards passed to John Brown, and from him to John Smyth, citizen of London. Another line of descent is given by other authorities, who state that it was appendant to the manor of Halnaker ; that it was confirmed in 1542 to Thomas, Lord la Warr; in 1554 to Henry, Earl of Arundel; and in 1593 to Anthony, Viscount Montague. Both accounts agree that it was purchased in 1703 by William Peachey, Esq., and descended to his family. The parish contains the three manors of Pailing ham, Bedeham, and Barkfold. In the early part of the present century, Edward Napper, Esq., of Isold, built a commodious mansion. The Benefice was given to the Abbey of Seez, in Nor mandy. At the Dissolution, it passed to Henry, Earl of Arundel, and at a later date from Lord John Lumley to Sir Peter Bettes worth. From that family it descended to Sir Richard Worsley, Bart. The church, dedicated to St. Mary, is spacious, with a lofty tower at the west end. There are monumental inscriptions to the families of Peachey, Winterton, &c. A few years since, during repairs, several mural paintings were brought to light. At the east end was the Crucifixion ; and on other walls, St. Nicholas restoring to life two children who had been salted down in a tub ; St. Catherine on her wheel ; a king exhorted to good by a counsellor on one side, and to evd by a demon on the other ; and (apparently) the Adoration of the Magi. These have mostly been plastered over, and the present incumbent had careful drawings of them. The chapel at Plaistow is dependent on Kirdford church. The old church, being in a state of dilapidation, was replaced by a new and larger one in 1856, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It appears that the manufacture of glass was carried on here in 1581, when \" David, son of Mr. Barry, glassmaker, stranger, was baptized.\" The fact of glassmaking ever having been car ried on in this county has been doubted. Charnock's \" Breviary of Philosophy \" has the following lines on the subject : \u2014 \" As for glassmakers they be scant in this land, Yet one there is as I do understand, And in Sussex now is his habitation, At Chedingfold he works of his occupation.\" Chiddingfold is within a short distance of Kirdford, although just within the county of Surrey.

The church and great part of the vidage street are in Kent, in the Lathe of Aylesford . The Sussex portion is in the Hundred of Loxfield-Camden. This lies at the north-east corner of Pevensey rape. The Tyse, a branch of the Medway, runs through the parish. The popula tion does not exceed 1,700, and the area is, Kent, 3,590 ; Sussex, 1,700 acres. The principal residence is Court Lodge, the pro perty of the Morland family. The manor of Lamberhurst was held in ancient times by the Norman family of Crevecceur, and at later dates the names of Lenham, Chidcroft, and Kenith are connected with it. Nicholas de Kenith gave it to Robertsbridge Abbey. Henry VIII. granted it to Sir Henry Sydney. In 1607 it passed to the family of Porter, and after several changes it was purchased temp. George I. by William Morland, Esq. Hodleigh, another manor, belonged to the canons of Lingfield in Surrey, and at the Dis solution it was granted to the Cardens, and passed from them to the Filmers. Scotney Castle, in this parish, gave name to the family of De Scotney. The manor hes chiefly in tbe Sussex portion. The house is castellated, and surrounded by a moat ; but of the original building few traces remain. The most conspicuous of the ancient proprietors was Walter de Scotney, who was tried and hanged at Winchester in 1259 \"for administering poison to Richard, Earl of Gloucester, and his brother Wilham, from which the former died. After the extinction of this family, it passed, temp. Edward III., to the Ashburnhams, and by them was sold to Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose niece conveyed it by marriage to John Darrell, of Cale Hill, in Kent, Esq. In 1 774 John Darrell, Esq., sold it to Mr. John Richards, of Robertsbridge, of whom it was purchased by Edward Hussey, Esq., grandfather of Edward Hussey, Esq., the present owner. Bayham Abbey is partly in this parish. (See that article.) Lamberhurst formerly possessed the largest iron-manufactory in Sussex. Gloucester Furnace, partly in this parish and partly in Wadhurst, was the greatest establishment in the south of England.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1580. Acreage, 2,524. Chief Landowner, Lieut.-Colonel Carr Lloyd, Manor-house.. Before the Conquest Lewin held Lancings of the Confessor; subsequently Robert held it of William de Braose, Lord of Bram ber. Lewin was assessed at 16 hides and a roodland. Robert, his Norman successor, had 12 hides and If rood. The arable was five plough-lands. There were in tbe demesne 13 villeins and 7 bondmen. There was a mill, and also 7 salt-pans. Two Knights possessed, besides, 2f hides and 11 salt-pans. Two Ralphs are mentioned among the tenants, one of whom had five additional salt-pans. This proves that the manufacture of salt in this seaboard parish was formerly of considerable extent. The ante-Domesday rental was \u00a39, and subsequently \u00a37. The details of the survey of Lancings are particularly minute. About the end of the 13th century, Ranulf de Broc, and John de Gad desden, held each two knights' fees in Lancing and the neigh bourhood. The manors of South Lancing, North Lancing, Monks, and Lyons, originally very small, have long been united in the proprietorship of one lord. The manors of South Lan cing and Lyons belonged to the great estate of Robert le Sau vage, and descended as Broadwater. Those of North Lancing, with Monks, after having been long in the possession of the families of Avenel and De Brok, came, perhaps by marriage, into that of Poynings. Temp. Henry VII. it was sold to Sir Reginald Bray, who transferred it to George, Lord Abergavenny. Subsequently it was in the Goring family, and so descended to the Biddulphs, as Burton. These formerly distinct, but now"], [331, "11 LANCING. united manors, extend, according to Cartwright, from West sea-mills gate, in Broadwater, to a place where the Adur (be fore the new cut was made about 1760) debouched into the sea, and thence ascend the old course of the river in the middle of the stream beyond the bridge. There has long been a question of right oi foreshore between the lords of Lancing and their east ern neighbour. If the river is to be taken as the limit of the two lordships, the boundary must have changed many times, as there has been a constant tendency of the Adur, as of nearly ad our Sussex rivers, towards the east, caused by the dashing of the Atlantic wave, driven by the south-west winds, up the English Channel. Even now, as I write, the question of the boundary of Lancing manor is sub lite. The Adur first and naturady debouched at Shoreham, but at subsequent periods, by the force of Caurus, it was driven eastward to different points almost as far as Brighton, and has frequently found its outlet far from the present one of Kingston harbour, which is so fortified by human agency that it seems probable that it will remain there. In the meantime, who has right to the foreshore to the south of this bend of the Adur P Let lawyers decide by the law of wrecca maris* In 1684, Sir Widiam Goring embanked 600 acres of land in this parish, by which he made a valuable addi tion to his land called the \" Salts-farm.\" The manors of North and South Lancing were sold, in 1827, by John Biddulph, Esq., to James Martin Lloyd, Esq., and they now belong to Colonel George Carr Lloyd. There are two other manors of smad ex tent in the parish caded Lancing and Grants ; the latter named after the family of Le Graunt, who possessed it in 1309. It afterwards (1567) passed to the Boorcls. It ultimately became the property of the Lloyds. There is, besides, a smad manor on the north side of the parish, called How in Domesday, and now How Court. At the date of Domesday Widiam Fitz-Bar nard held it of William de Warenne. It had been previously held by Earl Godwin at six hides. Six salt-pans are mentioned, showing that the manor extended either to the sea or the Adur, then, perhaps,, an estuary. Before the Conquest it was valued at \u00a34 ; afterwards at \u00a36. This manor descended, by consan guinity or purchase, through the families of De Combes, Hal sham, Shirley, and Caryll, to that of Lloyd. The manor, ac cording to Cartwright, pays tithe of corn and hay of about 294 acres to the rector of West Grinstead, and of about 45 to the vicar of Henfield. Mr Hussey thinks \" it may be admitted a probable conjecture that this parish derives its name from Wlencing, one of the sons of \u00c6da, the founder of the South Saxon kingdom.\" Considerable * This suit has just been decided against the lord of Lancing."], [332, "12 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. foundations of buildings, a bath, coins, interments, &c, were discovered on Lancing Down in 1828, but were destroyed by an ignorant proprietor. The coins range from Claudius to Galli enus, showing a long possession of the spot by the Romans. Full particulars of the discovery will be found in the scarce and extremely valuable \" Collectanea Antiqua \" of Mr. Charles Roach Smith, F.S.A., Vol. i, 92. The great tithes, with the exceptions just mentioned, were given by Sir .Michael de Poynings to the Friary of Motinden, in the parish of Headcorn in Kent. It is curious to note that the lands at this period (the time of Edward III.) were valued at threepence per acre. The priest, however, received \u00a323 6s. 8d. per annum. At the dissolution of the monasteries it was ex changed for certain lands in the see of Lincoln. Afterwards it passed, by lease, through the family of Barttelot to that of Lloyd. Mention is made in the Non\u00e6 rods (1341) of lands and a water mid destroyed by the sea. The church (St. James) is composed of tower, chancel, nave, and north and south aisles. The porch on the south side, and the west door, are described by Cartwright as Early Norman. There are additions and insertions of much later styles. The tower stands between the nave and chancel, and seems to have been much loftier than at present. It appears that in 1618 the upper part of the tower was taken down, and the present pyra midal cap added. In the chancel there is \" an arch of the age of Edward III., under which was no doubt anciently an effigy.\" (Cartwright.) The fodowing names are commemorated on monu mental stones in this church ; Martin, Temple, Lloyd, Bartlett, Pyxe, Bury, Jones, Winton, Tanner, Hersee, Olliver, Nash, &c. In the parish register is the following curious entry : \u2014 \" John Wolven, commonly called the honest man, buried June 13, 1691 .\" In 1685 many persons died of an infectious distemper. It is singular that, from 1669 to 1673,the funerals at New Shoreham are registered here. In this parish, on a commanding height, stands an extensive building, called St. Nicholas' College, founded for the purpose of educating boys ofthe middle classes in what are called \"high church\" principles. The edifice is handsome and commodious, and was erected chiefly through the exertions ofthe Rev.N. Wood ard, D.C.L., who is styled provost, not only of this school, but of similar establishments at Hurst-Pierpoint, Shoreham, Ardingly, and elsewhere. The Rev. R. E. Sanderson, M.A., assisted by several other clergymen, has charge of this important school. [S. A. C. Domesday watermill, v, 271. Church, xii, 107. De Broc, xv, 15. Bents to Boxgrove, v. 119.

Langney Point is an advanced tongue of shingle, situated about three miles south-west of Pevensey, at the extremity of Pevensey Bay. The shingle, driven hither by heavy south-west tides, is at one point upwards of a mile across, and is patched here and there with furze. Near it is a large lagoon caded Crumble Pond. Langney is locally in the parish of Westham. It is now a farm, and was anciently a grange belonging to the Priory of Lewes. The lands were granted, or confirmed, by divers bene factors, William Malfield, his wife and two sons, Simon de Ech ingham, Peter of Savoy, and King Henry III. The De Eching hams, however, reserved certain rights over the monks of Lewes, such as meat, drink, and lodgment for themselves, their horses, palfreys, grooms, and hunting-dogs during three days per annum, and the instruction of their servitor in the duties of a cook in the monks' kitchen. This claim was found burdensome by the brethren, and so in 1308, Sir William de Echingham accepted \u00a3100 by way of commutation. It is curious to note that a pow erful Baron, for such he was, should seek the assistance of \" ab stemious monks \" in his cuisine. The house at Langney, though much modernized, retains several vestiges of its former state, including a beautiful chapel, which was nearly entire when I visited the spot some years since. LAUGHTON.

The freshwater shelly concretion, called Sussex marble, is found in the south part of the parish, and is locally known as Laughton marble. The tributary of the Ouse, named the Ritch, flows through Laughton Level. The manor of Laughton, one of the most extensive in this part of Sussex, includes the greater part ofthe hundred of Shiplake, and has sub-infeudations both within and beyond that boundary. In Saxon times Earl Godwin held it,"], [334, "14 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. and after the Conquest it passed with the rape to the Earl of Moreton. There were 16 salt-pans on the estuary of the Ritch. During the Edwardian period the manor belonged successively to the great families of Badlesmere, Spenser, and De Vere. The next lords were the Pelhams, who have held it in continuity for the last five centuries, and the Earl of Chiehester still has from it his second title, Baron Pelham of Laughton. Laughton Place was the seat of the chivalrous Sir John Pel ham, who, in 1356, at the battle of Poictiers, took prisoner John, King of France, and so won the far-famed Pelham badge of the Buckle, which is still to be seen on many a church tower in East Sussex. The house, which is moated, was rebuilt in 1534 by Sir William Pelham, and stid presents some features of the fortalice of that date. It is built of brick, and contains some beautifully moulded ornaments, among which the Buckle is conspicuous. In the reign of Elizabeth the Pelhams re moved their chief residence from this house to Halland, where they built a splendid mansion on the site of the seat of the Hade family. (See Ore.) This mansion was on the borders of Laughton and East Hothly, the boundary line of the parishes passing through the site. (See East Hothly.) The church is composed of chancel, nave, and west tower, in styles varying from Early English to Decorated. The chancel, which serves as a mausoleum for the Pelham famdy, was rebuilt by the Duke of Newcastle in the last century. The vaults beneath contain the mortal remains of a long line of that illus trious race. In the spandrels of the doorway of the tower are the arms of Pelham and Colbrand, the latter family having formerly been owners of the estate called Colbrand's in this parish. There are inscriptions for the names of Pelham, Benge, Wenham, Courthope, &c. Chamber's Court, in this parish, was the original seat of the ancient family of De la Chambre, afterwards of Litlington, Rodmell, Denton, East Bourne, and Chyngton. It is now a small farmhouse only.

The Domesday manor of Loventune, or Levitone, by which this place is supposed to be meant, was held, in the time of the Confessor, by Godwin, a priest, and afterwards by Osborne, Bishop of Exeter. It was assessed at six hides, and was appropriated to the church of Bosham. It was afterwards trans ferred to the see of Canterbury, ancl subsequently came to the Crown. In 1560 Queen Elizabeth granted it to Sir Richard Baker, and in 1775 it was sold to Charles, third Duke of Richmond. The church (St. Mary) has Norman features, and consists of an ancient nave, with a chancel of much later date. The floor, says Horsfield, has slabs of Sussex marble, ornamented with crosses, one of which bears, in Lombardic characters, the legend \" Priez qui passez par ici, pur l'alme Luci de Mildebi.\" \" Ad you that pass by, pray for the soul of Lucy de Mildebi.\" There are other inscriptions to the names of Cawse, Stockton, Hen shaw, Heberden, and Compton.

It is placed in the hundred of Sille tone (Singleton) . Before the Conquest it belonged to Earl God win ; afterwards Ivo held it of Roger, Earl of Montgomeri. It consisted of nine hides. In 1581 Richard May of Rawmere held the manor of Mid-Lavant, and it continued in his family almost two centuries. Thomas May Knight, Esq., sold it to Charles, third Duke of Richmond. The large mansion com menced by Richard May towards the end of the reign of Eliza beth, and finished by his son, temp. James I., was taken down by the Duke of Richmond many years since. The church (St. Nicholas) was originally very small. The only ancient windows remaining are two lancets in the chancel, and a very small round-headed one in the nave. (Hussey.) Some mural paintings were discovered here about the year 1849. The modern church, consisting of nave and chancel, was erected by the family of May in the former part of the eighteenth century. There is a marble effigy of life size, of Dame Mary May, who died in 1681. |~S. A. C. See under East Lavant.] LEOMINSTER. (See Lyminster.) LEWES. Domesday, Lewes; a borough and market-town, and, for civil purposes, the County-town of Sussex. It is distant 50 miles south from London, and the meridian of Greenwich passes through its western extremity. It gives name to a Rape, an Archdeaconry, and a Union. It has a Post-office, and a station of the South Coast Rail- way, from which several lines radiate. Its population in 1811 was 6,664, and in 1861, 10,116. Including the suburbs of Southover, Cliffe, and, South Mailing, it contains seven parishes, and for con- venience, these will be dealt with collectively. Except Brighton it is the largest town on the South Down range. Lewes proper rises rather abruptly from the Ouse, its navigable river, upon a spur of the Downs, by one long thoroughfare called High Street, running in the direction of Brighton, and nearly a mile in length : the lateral streets are generally small and unimportant. The suburb called the Cliffe Hes on the east side of the Ouse, in the Rape of Pevensey. South Mailing is also in Pevensey Rape, and is a continuation of the Cliffe in two streets. Southover, as its first syllable im plies, occupies a position south and south-west of the town."], [337, "17 LEWES. Newhaven, six mdes southward, is the port of Lewes, and, together with the railway, greatly assists the commerce of the town. For picturesqueness of situation few places can compare with Lewes. The keep of its Castle rises with much grandeur as the central object, a kind of Acropolis, and forms a noble object from every point of view. There is much irregular natural beauty everywhere, and to add to its attractions the late Widiam Cobbett pronounced it to be \" the town of clean windows and pretty faces ! \" The etymology of the name is very uncertain, and much truly ridiculous conjecture has been spent upon it. (See Dr. Charnock's \" Local Etymology.\") The town and its name are both unquestionably Celtic in origin, and the second sydable, es, doubtless means water, in allusion to the situation on what was once a considerable estuary ofthe English Channel. Of the early history of the town little can be ascertained. Roman urns, coins, &c, have frequently been discovered, and Lewes has been supposed to be identical with the obscure station known as Mutuantonis. Earlier remains ofthe pre-historic period have also frequently been exhumed from the neighbouring downs. In Saxon times Lewes became more important, and previously to the reign of Athelstan had two mints which continued to issue a silver coinage down to the days of Harold. Specimens of Lewes pennies were discovered both in the \" Alfriston find \" and in the more remarkable one at Washington, in 1866. So early as the days of the Heptarchy, Mailing had become a seat of Christianity, Ceadwada, king of Wessex and Sussex having there founded a college, which he gave to the church of Canterbury. At the Conquest King William I. gave to William de Warenne, the husband of his daughter Gundrada, together with enormous ' possessions in Surrey, Yorkshire, Norfolk, &c, the town and rape of Lewes, that is to say a sixth part of the whole county. The account of the town in Domesday is very curious. Edward the Confessor had 127 burgesses in domain, who paid him in rent and toll, \u00a36 13s. l^d., and 20s. as a subsidy, when he sent an armament to guard the seas. The purchaser of a man paid 4d. toll ; a murderer could expiate his crime for 7s. 4d., an adulterer and a runaway singularly enough paid more, viz., 8s. 4d. each. The population is supposed at this period to have been less than 1900 persons. William de Warenne, having made Lewes his chief residence and caput baroni\u00e6, erected a magnificent Castle, probably on the site of an olderfortress. In conjunction with his idustrious consort he also founded the great Priory of St. Pancras, in Southover. Their successors, the Earls of Warenne and Surrey, played an active part in field and council. John, seventh Earl, took part with Henry III., but deserted him in the hour of danger. When VOL. II. c"], [338, "18 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Edward I. issued his commission to ascertain by what right the great feudal lords held their lands, the Earl drew a rusty old sword, exclaiming : \" By this weapon did my ancestor win his lands, at Hastings, and with the same I will defend them ! \" His grandson of the same name, eighth and last Lord of Lewes, of his name, died in 1347, when the Barony devolved upon his sister Alice, wife of Edmund Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, in whose heirs general, the Earls of Abergavenny and De la Warr, ' and the Duke of Norfolk, the barony now jointly vests. From the early part of the fifteenth century the lords were non-resi dent, and Lewes lost its feudal importance. In 1205, 1209, and 1213, King John paid hurried visits to the town, and in 1264 occurred on the Downs, close by, the memor able Battle of Lewes. The confederated Barons having taken arms under Simon de Montfort, the two hostile armies met in deadly strife on the 14th of May. Henry III. had lodged himself on the previous night at the Priory, while Prince Edward had made the Castle his head quarters. Simon de Montfort and his troops made a hasty march from London towards Lewes, ancl the battle took place to the north westward of the town, the fury of the warfare having ranged, according to tradition, from Mount Harry (so named from the King ?) to the Castle itself, and even beyond, into the marshy estuary of the Ouse. The result of this battle is well known. The Baronial party were victorious. Henry and Prince Edward were fain to take refuge at the Priory. Richard, titular King of the Romans, and brother of the King, was captured in a windmill near the site of the Black Horse Inn ; and after the slaughter of thousands of men on each side, a mise or treaty was entered into between the belligerents, which eventually resulted in the establishment of a representative government, and it is not too much to assert that the \" great Battle of the Constitution\" was fought on Lewes hills. Such numerous details of the battle, its causes, and consequences, have been given in Mr. Blaauw's researchful work, \" The Baron's War,\" that we have no need to enlarge on this grand historical event. King Edward I. was several times at Lewes, between the years 1276 and 1305. In 1377 the French having made a hostile descent upon our coast at Rottingdean, John de Cariloco, Prior of St. Pancras, with some neighbouring gentlemen and a body of rustics, met them on the Downs between the two points. Though the little Lewes army succeeded in driving the enemy to their ships, the prior and two attendant knights were carried off as prisoners. At this period Lewes was a well-fortified town, and traces of the wall still remain. It had a prison and a market, a merchant-guild, and a staple of wool. It also con-"], [339, "19 LEWES tained three conventual establishments and fourteen parish churches, besides chapels and hospitals. Nothing of interest is recorded for several generations, but in 1537 the Priory was dissolved, and what had been the main stay of the repute and prosperity of the town disappeared. In 1545 the French again invaded Sussex, but a Lewes knight, Sir Nicholas Pelham, an cestor of the Earl of Chiehester, repulsed them valiantly. In the reign of Queen Mary, Lewes, as the county town, was the scene of many of those holocausts which disgraced her times. Sixteen martyrs to the cause of the Reformation were burnt in the forum of Lewes \u2014 the local Smithfield, opposite the Star inn \u2014 between 1555 and 1557, the last \" burnt-offering to a good conscience \" being the wed-known iron-master, Richard Woodman, and nine others, five of whom were women. At a later period most of the county gentry had town houses in Lewes, and a great portion of the High Street was occupied with these residences, many of which, with spacious gardens, remain. Daniel de Foe, in his \" Tour,\" 1724, and Dr. Burton in his \" Iter Sussexiense,\" some years later, give graphic accounts of the town. In the course of the French war, Lewes became a considerable military station, and extensive barracks were built at the western extremity of the town. During the gay career of the Prince Regent (George TV.) that personage annually visited Lewes for three days for the races. In 1830 King William and Queen Adelaide had a loyal reception ; and Queen Victoria has also passed through the town en route for Buxted Park, the residence of her Lord Chamberlain, the late Earl of Liverpool. Lewes Castle, as we have seen, was built by De Warenne soon after the Conquest Ifs existing remains are the Keep, which occupies a commanding artificial mound, and dominates the town in a manner truly feudal ; some walls of the enciente ; and the Barbican or advanced work, a picturesque gateway of the fourteenth century, covering the simple Norman semi-circular perforation of the wall, which was the original gate. This once frowning stronghold included a base court more than 800 feet in its longest diameter, and had, besides the Keep proper, another elevation called the Brackmount, on which formerly stood a kind of second keep, or a strong tower. The precinct now contains two or three private residences, and an excellent bowling-green. In 1850 the Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Society hired the Castle of the Lords of the Borough, which they still occupy \u2014 the keep as a museum of local antiquities, and the barbican as a council-chamber. The leads of the keep command a noble and picturesque view, embracing the Weald, the site of the Battle, the port of Newhaven, and that remarkable geological \" fault,\" the Combe, in the range called Cliff Hill. c 2"], [340, "20 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The Priory, which lies in a meadow in the suburban parish of Southover, was founded, as before stated, by William de Warenne and Gundrada, about the year 1078, and dedicated to St. Pancras, the martyr, to whose honour a small wooden church had existed on the spot before the Conquest. It was of the Cluniac order, a branch of the Benedictines, and the first house of that denomination in England. Its endow ments were enormous, and its prior being mitred, subse quently became a peer of the realm. The first prior was Lanzo, a man of great piety and learning, and there were few monasteries in this country which enjoyed so wide a reputation. Among those who added to its endowments and found sepulture in its church were the De Warennes, Clares, De Veres, St. Johns, Fitz-Alans, De Lancasters, and Nevilles. The vicissitudes of this great Priory have been set forth in several notices by Mr. Blaauw in \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections.\" At the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII., in 1537, the revenues were estimated at \u00a31,091 9s. 6d., equal to at least \u00a310,000 at the present day. The Vicar General, Cromwell, immediately ordered the work of demolition to commence, and one Portinari, an Italian, speedily performed the execrable deed of levelling with the ground, the great church, equal in extent to most cathedrals, the chapter-house, cloisters, &c, so that to-day we see in a few rude and unintelligible walls all that remains of this once enormous group of buddings, which occupied with its adjunct of \" Calvary,\" garden, pigeon house, and stews for fish, a splendid area of forty acres. Crom well himself got a grant of the Priory and all its possessions, and after that favourite's deposition they were granted by Henry to his repudiated queen, Anne of Cleves. Tradition assigns as her residence the old porched house of the Pelhams, in the High Street of Southover ; but there is no proof : indeed poor Anne seems to have had as many residences and places of death as Oliver Cromwell had skulls. At a later date Thomas Sack ville, the Elizabethan poet and statesman, had a house on the site of the Priory, called the Lord's place, which was burnt down. The manor of Southover subsequently passed to the families of Tufton, Trayton, Durrant, and Verrall, William Verrall, Esq., being the existing lord. The portion of tbe priory demesne which contains the ruins belongs to Mrs. John Blaker. A short distance to the north-east of the ruins is a remarkable mound with a spiral pathway, obviously the ancient Calvary of the monastery. The earth of which it is constructed was evi dently taken from an adjacent depressed spot, called from its shape the Dripping-pan, and now devoted to cricket matches and other public amusements."], [341, "21 LEWES. During the progress of the excavations necessary for the for mation of the South-Coast Railway, which passes through the Priory grounds, occurred, in 1845, one of the most remarkable arch\u00e6ological discoveries of our times. This was no less than two smad leaden coffers, less than three feet in length, contain ing respectively the bones of Willelm' (de Warenne) and Gun deada, the founder and foundress of the Priory, who had died before the completion of the great church, and been buried in the ordinary manner. On the completion of that edifice their bones were doubtless exhumed and removed to the more honour able place of sepulture. The names of both these illustrious personages were inscribed on the lids of the coffers, which are preserved in Southover church. Many other objects of anti quarian interest were brought to light at the same time. The other monastic institutions of Lewes were : \u2014 (1.) Mading Deanery, previously mentioned as having been founded in Saxon times, which was dissolved by Henry VIII., in 1545. It was originady built at Old Mailing, and afterwards removed to South Mailing, in the same parish. The assassins of Thomas a Becket took shelter here in their flight on the second night after the murder at Canterbury, and the notable miracle of the table in the great hall having tilted itself to throw off the blood stained armour of the knights is known to the readers of Stan ley's Memorials of Canterbury. (2.) The house of Grey Friars without the east gate of the town. Of its foundation nothing is known, and it possesses httle history, except that two of the brethren mediated between Henry III. and the Barons in 1264. After the Dissolution it became a private residence, and was puded down to make room for the railway station in 1845. (3.) The hospital of St. James, near the gate of the Priory, for thirteen poor brethren and sisters, whose duty was to pray for the founders and their heirs. The chapel, now much patched, is stid standing. (4.) A miserable old thatched cottage in St. Anne's, caded the Spital, represents the Hospital of St. Nicholas, a place of rest and entertainment for pilgrims to St. Pancras' Priory. A brief topographical account of Lewes follows. Southover Church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, stands in the southern suburb of the town. It is in various styles, from Early Norman to the non-descript of the 18th century \u2014 the brick tower being of the last-mentioned period. It stands just outside the ancient gateway of the Priory, and contains a very elegant sacellum, erected in 1867, in which are preserved the remains ofthe founder and foundress, previously mentioned. This church formerly had chajiels dedicated to SS. Katherine and Erasmus, which have disappeared. There are many inscriptions to the Newton, Verrall, and other fandlies. Near it is a curious and picturesque"], [342, "22 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. old Elizabethan mansion, which was built with part of the materials of the Priory, by William Newton, Esq., steward of Lord Buckhurst, Earl of Dorset. It has quaint gables and win dow frames. The date on the mantel-piece of the dining-room shows the year of its erection to be 1572. It was the residence of the Newton family, until within the last few years ; but now belongs to Captain Wyndham. In the time of the late Colonel Newton, George IV., when Prince-Regent, was a frequent visitor here. Leaving the west end of Southover at the point where the road to Newhaven and Seaford commences, and passing along Win terbourne Lane (so-called from a pellucid stream which runs only during the winter season), we reach the Spital, or hospital of St. Nicholas, just mentioned. Close to this is the large county gaol. Descending towards the town we see the church of St. Anne, anciently St. Mary Westout. Outside the western walls of Lewes there formerly stood two churches, St. Peter and St. Mary. The houses of the former parish principally contained in what was caded Antioch Street (possibly a reminiscence of the Crusades), were burnt down in the 16th century, and the two parishes were united under the name of St. Anne. The church thus designated is an Early English structure, and contains some interesting features, especially a barrel-shaped font with fretwork ornaments, probably of Saxon date. Near the church is \" Shelley's,\" so-called from its having long been the seat of a branch of that eminent Sussex family. Dr. Johnson, on a visit to the Tbrales at Brighton, once spent a day at this mansion, and a hitherto unrecorded anecdote may here be given. The philosopher was walking in the garden with a little Miss Shedey, two or three years old, in his hand, until at last, being tired of her companionship, he deliberately placed her between the branches of a cherry-tree, and there left her. At dinner time there was a hue and cry after the child, and Johnson, recollect ing himself, said, \" 0, I left her in a tree I\" The tree survived this incident until within recent years, and was always known as \" Dr. Johnson's cherry-tree.\" Near this house is the gram mar-school, founded about 1512, by Dame Agnes Morley ; and, stid further down the street, there stood till lately a building called St. Anne's House, long the pleasant abode of the writer of these pages, but now replaced by a modern structure of the metropolitan cut. That house had many historical remem brances, it having been the abode, in the time of James I., of John Rowe, principal of Clifford's Inn, a great lawyer and an eminent local antiquary ; and subsequently, the property of Sir Roger Newdigate, founder of the Newdigate prize for English poetry at Oxford. The town was formerly fortified with wads,"], [343, "23 LEWES. the West-gate of which we next approach; the others being the East-gate and the Water-gate ; but the traces of ad are now very slight. St. Michael's Church, hard by, has a few ancient features, but it was chiefly rebuilt in the worst taste of the 18th century. Its round tower, however, remains, as well as two brasses ; one for a knight of the 15th century, and another for 0oljfS JJrag'bfor'u?, rector, with the date 1457. There is also a mural monument to Sir Nicholas Pediam, the gallant defender of Sea ford, who died in 1559. The epitaph assures us that : \u2014 \" What time the French sought to have sack't Sea-Foord, This Pelham did vepel 'em back aboordl\" In this parish are two other places deserving of notice ; first, the old \" town house \" of the Goring family, long since con- verted into a Presbyterian chapel, and an ancient dweding re- cognised by a singular carving of Pan at one comer, but more noteworthy as the residence for some time of Tom Paine, the atheistical writer of the \" Age of Reason,\" who was then a local exciseman. He wrote that execrable book in this house, and the table on which he wrote it was, about fifty years since, in the possession of the late William Lee of this town. In this parish also resided the late Dr. Gideon Mantell, the celebrated geologist, who collected the \" Mantellian Museum,\" of Sussex fossils, &c, now in the British Museum. A little lower in the street is the County-hall, for courts of assize and other public business ; a building with a handsome facade. The original town-had stood, before the erection of this edifice, in the middle of the High-street. Next come two ancient inns, the White Hart (modernized) and the Star. The latter has some historical celebrity, for in front of it the Protestants were burnt during the Marian persecution. In this inn is a very fine Jacobean staircase brought hither from Slaugham Place in the last century. In the market-tower, close at hand, is the great town bed called Gabriel, of the time of Henry VIII. From this point we pass down School-hid, a steep declivity, to- wards the site of the ancient monastery of the Grey Friars, of which no remains exist, the ground being partly occupied by a very handsome building called the FitzRoy Memorial Library. This edifice, which cost nearly \u00a35,000, was presented by the widow of the late Right Hon. Henry Fitzroy (M.P. for Lewes for more than twenty years), to the town, and it contains a valuable collection of books, a school of art, &c. Close by is the bridge over the Ouse, and the suburb called the Cliffe is next entered. It has a church dedicated to St. Thomas d Becket, for merly a chapel dependent on South Mailing. This building, though principady of the Perpendicular period, with some"], [344, "24 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. modern churchwardenizations, contains traces of much earlier architecture. In the south aisle there was formerly a guild or fraternity of St. Thomas. Passing a sharp angle on the left, we proceed towards Mading, leaving on the right that remark able chasm in the chalk formation called the \" Coombe.\" Near at hand is \" Jireh,\" one of the largest dissenting chapels in the county, in the little cemetery of which lie the remains of the well-known William Huntington, the Hyper-Calvinist, with the curious epitaph : \" Here lies the Coalheaver, beloved of his God, but abhorred of men. The omniscient Judge, at the grand assize, shall ratify this to the confusion of many thousands, for England and its metropolis shad know that there hath been a prophet among them. \u2014 W. H., S.S.\" This was composed by the deceased himself, an arrogant but clever man, who having married the widow of a Lord Mayor, and looking, with a touch of envy perhaps, at the D.D.'s of the period, gave himself the title of \" Sinner Saved \" (S.S.). Mailing Church is a simple fabric, consisting of a nave only, and stands at a considerable distance from the population. It was erected in 1628, under the will of John Stansfield, Esq., who endowed it as a perpetual curacy, and one of the foundation stones was laid by his after wards eminent grandson, John Evelyn, author of \" Sylva,\" &c, who records that circumstance in his \" Diary.\" There are memorials to the names of Kempe, Spence, Grantham, Court hope, Cayley, Brodie, &c. ; but the most striking inscrip tion is that which records the death, in December, 1836, of eight persons who were killed in South Street, in this parish, by a very remarkable avalanche. A vast mass of drifted snow slipped from its position, on the crest of Cliffe-hill, overturned a range of cottages, and destroyed these poor people. Mailing was one of the oldest seats of Christianity in the county, and I have already noticed it in this article. Few remains of it now exist, and, at some unknown date, the College was removed lower down the banks of the Ouse to what is called South Mailing, near the present church, to the site of the mansion now pos sessed by E. C. Currey, Esq., where it remained until the Re formation. This house is still called Mailing \" Deanery,\" and was long the seat of the ancient family of Spence. Mailing House belongs to the family of Crofts, the representative of which is Henry Crofts, Esq., of Sompting Abbots. Returning once more to Lewes proper, we must notice St. John's Church, a modem brick structure, which we cannot commend, as it is a kind of hybrid between a castle and a barn. It supersedes a very venerable structure, probably of the time of the Confessor, which was pulled down in 1838 to meet the necessities of an increased population. Some relics of the old edifice have been"], [345, "25 LEWES. preserved and built into the walls of the new, including the mouldings of a Saxon doorway, and especially an ancient monu ment arranged in the form of an arch, with the following in scription cut on fifteen stones in two semi-circular lines : \u2014 \" Cladditur hic Miles, Danorum regia proles ; Mangnus nomen ei, hangn\u00e6 nota progenei : Deponens Mangnum, se moribus indi.it agnum, Prepete pro vita, fit parvulds arnaoorita.\" \" Here is immured a Soldier of the Royal Family of Denmark, whose name Magnus * bespeaks his distinguished lineage. Relinquishing his greatness, he assumes the deportment of a lamb, and exchanges a life of ambition for that of a lowly anchorite.\" Of the history of this person and his connection with the Kings of Denmark nothing can be discovered. He appears to have been one of those fanatics who caused themselves to be shut up within the walls of churches in what were caUed inclusoria, and making a vow of sdence for life. The inscription has been regarded as a mortuary epitaph, but it is not so, as the Rev. E. Turner in an able article, mentioned below, sufficiently proves. The tradition that he was a Danish marauder slain at the Wallands, hard by, in a conflict with the English, is totally unfounded, as the inscription is of the thirteenth century. The church-yard of St. John occupies part of a very small camp considered to be Roman, part of the vallum of which is traceable. There are memorials to the names of Shore, Le Pla, Campion, Crofts, &c, and one to Thomas Blunt, an eminent barber of Lewes, who made several donations to the borough, including a silver-gdt loving-cup, still used on festive occasions. The inscription on his tomb is in Latin, and records his various bequests. The last couplet is to this effect : \u2014 \" These gifts he gave, this done, himself to death is given; These gifts he gave, and thus received the gifts of heaven ! \" All Saints' Church is also a plain, inelegant budding, erected in 1807, with the exception of the tower, which is in the Per pendicular style. There are memorials for the names of Trayton, Durrant, Isted, Blunt, Woollgar, and for John Stansfield, Gent., the founder of Mading church. There are traces of many churches now destroyed. Near the top of School-hill stood St. Nicholas, or the \" broken church,\" the remembrance of which is retained in the name of St. Nicholas (vulgo Dolphin) lane. St. Mary's-lane, vulgo \" Simmery-lane,\" was named after a now des troyed church, some remains of which are supposed to exist in the cellar of the house of Mr. Richards, nearly opposite the Star * Misspelt Mangnus."], [346, "26 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. hotel. In what is called Campion's lane stood the church of St. Andrew ; and near the office of the \" Sussex Advertiser \" was another church dedicated to St. Mary in Foro, as the market was in early times held near that spot. A few yards distant, St. Martin's-lane indicates a church under the invocation of that famous military saint, who shared his cloak with a poor frozen beggar. These churches all stood on the south side of the High street. St. Swithin's-lane also probably indicates the existence of a church dedicated to that saint. Lewes abounds with dis senting chapels of nearly every denomination, and possesses a Roman Catholic cliapel, lately erected. The town was for a long time in a stationary position, and the population did not increase ; but of late an inqDetus has been given to the building trade. Some excellent houses have sprung up, and it is believed that in a few years Lewes will be second to few towns near the South Coast, especiady should Mr. W. E. Baxter's project for a new suburb, \" Wadands Park,\" be carried out. The natural and artificial advantages of the town are very great indeed. Among the eminent residents or natives of Lewes must be reckoned Sir Thomas Browne, author of \" Religio Medici; \" Richard Challenor, D.D., the celebrated Roman Catholic bishop and theologian, born 1691; Paul Dun van, author of a \"History of Lewes and Brighthelmstone\" (1795) ; John Elliot, the antiquary, born 1725 ; John Evelyn, author of\" Sylva,\" &c; the Rev. T. W. Horsfield, the historian of Sussex, who died in 1837 ; Dr. Gideon Manted, F.R.S., the renowned geologist ; Richard Russell, M.D., the founder of Brighton, born 1687 ; John Tabor, M.D., the eminent physician and antiquary ; Thomas Twyne, M.D., the great physician and classical scholar, who lies buried in St. Anne's church, with a very quaint inscription, dated 1613 ; James Lambert, a local self-taught artist of the last century j whose drawings of Sussex antiquities are in the Burrell Collections in the British Museum ; John Dudeney, the philosophical shepherd and schoolmaster (ob. 1852) ; John Rowe, lawyer and antiquary (see ante). Edmund Dudley, the well-known minister of Henry VII., and. the co-extortioner of Richard Empson, was the son of a traveding carpenter who settled at Lewes Priory, and there Edmund is said to have received his education.

Lindfield is situated in a most picturesque country, and its broad village street, with its antique timbered houses, is exceed ingly interesting. Any one tired of the bustle of this changeful life might safely retire to Lindfield as one of the most peaceful spots in Britain. Its name appears to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon linde, a linden, or lime tree, and fold, a field. The manor anciently belonged to the College of Mailing near Lewes, and was thence known as the manor of South-Mal ling-Lindfield. Tradition speaks of a convent in this parish, but of its history and situation I can obtain no particulars. There are several ancient residences. Pax-Hill is a stone man sion, built late in the reign of Elizabeth, on an elevated spot, and surrounded with a deer park. It was long the residence of a branch of the Boord or Board family, and the last male heir of that line dying in 1 787, left it to his three daughters and co-heiresses, one of whom married Gibbs Crawfurd, Esq., whose grand-daughter was wife of Arthur W. W. Smith, Esq. Albert Smith, brother of the latter, the well-known comic lecturer and writer, built a chdlet near the park, and occasionady resided there. Kenwardes, an ancient building, now occupied as a farm house, was long a seat of the old Sussex family of Chaloner, or Challener, of whom was Major Chaloner, a partizan of Crom well. He was an influential magistrate, and many lay marriages were performed before him. East Maskalls formerly belonged to a family of that name, and was owned, in the seventeenth cen tury, by a branch of the Newtons, of the same family as the Newtons of Southover, near Lewes, from whom it descended to the family of Noyes. The mansion was constructed in the old timber-framed style, and was long in a very ruinous condition, and tenanted by cottagers. The arms of the Newtons, in painted glass, were formerly in the windows. Sir Isaac Newton is sup posed to have been a connection of an earlier line of this family. Sunte belonged to the family of Hamlyn. John Hamlyn, Esq., who died in 1774 left two daughters and co-heiresses. Anne,"], [350, "30 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. the elder, married John Borrer, Esq. of Henfield, and after wards John Dennet, Esq., of Woodmancote : it is now the seat of George Catt, Esq. Buxshalls, supposed to have been the residence of a branch of the ancient family of Boxhulle of Ro bertsbridge, one of whom was K. G. in the reign of Edward III., is a pleasant modern erection on an ancient site. Paper works were formerly carried on in this parish. The church (St. John the Baptist), principally in the Perpen dicular style, is a picturesque object. The tower seems to be Early English, and has a shingled spire. The budding is cruciform, and on the south is a parvise, or small apartment over the entrance. The north transept was rebuilt, during the repairs which the building underwent some years ago. Those repairs were carried out without the smallest regard to pro priety or respect for antiquity. Some of the most beautiful fragments of fourteenth-century glass I ever saw were re moved from one of the south windows, and a brass plate to the memory of (\u00c6ljaUcttrr, which I remember in situ, on a stone on the floor, now lies before me. It bears the date of 1501. Beautiful wood carvings were also removed from the church ; in short, there was a general spoliation of nearly all that was ancient. There are, or were, mortuary inscriptions to the names of Allen, Board, Burrell, Wildbee, Spence, &c. A Perpendicular altar-tomb has been removed, and the brasses of a slab repre senting a man, woman, and seven children have also been taken away. All this spoliation, which grieves the antiquary's heart, is owing to the singular ecclesiastical condition of the parish. It was, at a very early date, one of the \" peculiars\" of the Arch bishops of Canterbury, and as such was granted by Archbishop Theobald, in 1150, to the College of Mading. On the dissolu tion of that establishment, in 1546, it was given to Sir Thomas Palmer of Angmering, a gentleman of the Privy Chamber of Henry VIII., an enormous acquirer of church property in Sussex, and it remained in lay hands, the holder being bound to repair the chancel and provide an \" honest priest\" for the services of the church. This poor cleric got about \u00a330 a year, and some times as little as \u00a320, while the impropriator derived a large sum from the parish in tithes, &c. This led to a very lax state of things ; the Archbishop declined to interfere, and not unfre quently no service was held. Even worse than this, the last rites of the church could hardly be performed, and it is said that within the nineteenth century bodies of deceased par ishioners have remained in the church for several days for want of an officiating priest ! A better state of things, however, now prevails. A curious \" Boke of Accompts\" of the parish, dating from 1580, came into the hands of the Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Society some years since, but is now in proper custody. It is"], [351, "31 LINDFIELD. LITLINGTON. full of interesting matter, and an abstract of it has been printed in vol. xix of the \" Collections.\" It appears from this document that the inhabitants did all in their power to maintain the fabric of the church, and that they were particularly fond of bell ring ing. There are at present five bells. It may be mentioned that there is in the church a very unusual sepulchral effigy, impressed or incised on three glazed tiles, the entire size of the memorial being 45 inches by 15 : the date is 1520. In 1848 a curious mural painting was disclosed on the east wall of the south transept. It represented the Archangel St. Michael and St. Margaret, with a dragon of many heads at their feet. The Archangel held a pair of scales, in which he was weighing the souls of the dead. Altogether there are in Sussex few parishes of more interest than Lindfield, either for the antiquary or the artist. The well known and respected Sussex family of Verral seem to have ori ginated here, and the name was formerly written Fairhall. [S. A. C. Mural paintings, ii, 129. Iron-works, ii, 214. xix, 41.

The manor is a sub-infeudation of Bishop ston. Temp. Henry II. it was the property of the family of Husee, or Hosatus, who gave a rent from a mill here to Dureford Abbey in West Sussex. Since that time it has been held by Hunt, Rootes, Pelham, Mallory, Bean, and Scutt. Chambers Court, now destroyed, received its name from the ancient family of De la Chambre, originally of Chambers Court, in Laughton, and subsequently of Rodmill, Denton, and Seaford. One of the name was at Agincourt. The church consists of a nave, chancel, and bell-turret, with a spire. Of the three bells one is inscribed to St. John. The chancel and other portions are Norman. The west end is Deco rated or earlier. Two sedilia, a piscina, and traces of a rood loft remain; also in the north wall of the chancel a Perpendicular tomb-arch. (Hussey.) On the floor was a fractured stone, marked with crosses, which was originally the altar. In the north-west angle of the nave is a very small newel staircase. The church has recently been restored, at an expense of \u00a3600. Here are ex tensive nursery, fruit, and pleasure gardens, beautifudy situated on rising ground near the river Cuckmere. [S. A. C.

It is the port of Arundel, and enjoys a considerable coasting trade, which has of late years added materially to the population. Before the Conquest, the Countess Goda, daughter of Ethelred II., had a hide in this manor. Afterwards it belonged to Earl Roger de Montgomeri. Before the confiscation of the alien priories, the French abbeys of Seez and Almanesche had lands here. At the Dissolution these lands came into the possession of the Crown, and the manor of Littlehampton, cum Tottington (in Lyminster), was sold in 1562, to John Palmer, Esq., of Angmering. Sir Thomas Palmer,"], [353, "33 LITTLEHAMPTON. his son, succeeded in 1571. In 1712 Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, purchased the lands which now belong to the present Duke of Norfolk. Baylies Court is an outlying portion of this parish, that of Climping intervening. As is usual with Sussex rivers, the Arun has been driven by the force of the south-west winds, which tend by the accumulation of shingle, to the east. By this alteration the outlet of the river is now in Climping. In 1734, an Act was passed for erecting piers and repairing Arundel Harbour in the parish of Littlehampton. In 1739 a smad battery was constructed for the protection of the port, and a new one has been built on the west side of the river. Ship building is carried on here to a considerable extent, and Little hampton has lately become a watering-place of considerable attractions. It is quiet, aud possesses the advantages of agree able scenery, a pure ah, and excedent sea-sands. Regattas and races are annuady held. The Empress Maude is said to have landed here in 1139, on a visit to Queen Adeliza at Arundel, after which she was besieged there by King Stephen. The church (Our Lady) having been found too small for the population was taken down in 1826, and a larger one erected. In the new church the east window, a round-headed doorway, and the ancient font have been preserved. There is one bell. The ecclesiastical history of this parish is very curious. At the confiscation of the church lands by Henry V., on the dissolution of the alien priories before mentioned, a portion of them was granted to the Nunnery of Sion in Middlesex, and the other portion to the Codege of Arundel. The latter establishment found an officiating priest for the cure of souls, who was styled \" Clericus conductitius,\" or removable curate. In the time of Henry VEIL, Henry, Earl of Arundel, became possessed of the lands which had belonged to Arundel College, and his moiety was transferred by him to John Edmondes, Esq. The other moiety was retained by the Crown tdl 3rd Elizabeth, when, by an exchange, it passed to the see of Chiehester, and the Bishop became impropriator, tbe vicarage being held under seques tration. Tanner mentions a Priory in Littlehampton called Athering ton ; but this seems to rest upon the assumption that the monks of Seez had a cell here, whereas it appears that there was only a single monk resident, who acted as Bailiff, and hence the place acquired the name of Baylie's Court.

(see Lurgashall.) This long and narrow parish is intersected in its southern portion by the Western Rother, which is here crossed by a bridge. The parish is famous for its growth of apples. The Liberty of Lodsworth, which is co-extensive with the parish, possesses remarkable privileges, viz. \u2014 exemption from hundred-courts, from tolls in any fair or market, and from the jurisdiction of the sheriff \u2014 but the bailiff of the Bishop of London is to return all writs. A three-weeks' court may be held for re covery of debts by a jury of free suitors, with imprisonment for debt within the gaol belonging to the liberty. No inquisitions post-mortem are to be held for lands, &c. These immunities and privileges are set forth in an Inspeximus dated 3rd Henry VI., 1425. The parish was an early appendage to the see of London, and these peculiar rights were granted by one of the Bishops, but what the parish gained in temporal matters it lost in spiritual, for the cure of souls of the church of St. Peter de volved on a stipendiary priest, while the great tithes accrued to St. Paul's. This was literally \" robbing Peter to pay Paul.\" The manor was granted by Henry VIII. to Sir Anthony Browne, who annexed it to Cowdray, with which it has ever since passed. Lodsworth House, the seat of Hasler Hollist, Esq., is a modern mansion with a tower, in a small but beautiful park. Mr. Hollist took the name in exchange from Capron, a family who held lands in Lodsworth in the thirteenth century. The church (St. Peter) is sometimes described as a chapel to Easebourne. It consists of a nave, chancel, transepts, aisles, and a square tower, and has been almost entirely rebudt within the last few years. It contains several memorials for the fami lies of Hollist and Bridger. Of the old manor-house adjacent to the churchyard the following account was printed a few years since : \u2014 \" It is now a farmhouse and much shorn of its former dimensions. Many of its rooms are much dilapidated.

It is, however, only the chancel of the original Early English structure. This parish was originady a chapelry to Alciston. About forty years since a gentleman attended morning service here, when the congregation amounted to twelve persons. The curate was a remarkably diminutive man : he preached from John xi, 35, and the offertory realized 18d. \u2014 upon which the stranger remarked that it was the smallest church, the smallest parson, the shortest text, and the smallest collection he had ever witnessed.

A parish in the Hundred of Eotherbridge ; Eape of Arundel ; distant five miles north-west from Petworth, its Post-town and Bailway station. Union, Midhurst. Population in 1811, 549 ; in 1861, 727. Benefice, a Bectory, valued at \u00a3463; Patron, Lord Leconfield; Incumbent, Bev. Septimus Fairies, B.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1559. Acreage, 4,850. Chief Landowners, Lord Leconfield, Lord Egmont, W. T. Mitford, Esq., and Hasler Hollist, Esq. Seat, Blackdown Cottage, General Yaldwin. The ancient spellings Lodekersale, Lotegershale, &c, justify the derivation of the name of this parish from Leodgarius (corruptly Leger), whose aula or hall it probably was, in Saxon times. The situation is truly romantic, and from Blackdown Hill views certainly unequalled in Sussex for grandeur and variety can be obtained. This hill, which is of triangular form, lies half in this parish \u2014 the rest in Lodsworth and Farnhurst. It is a remarkable cropping up of the greensand formation, and rises towards Lurgashall to a bold promontory 800 feet above the level of the sea. It is covered with furze, holly, and timber, and from its grand and sombre appearance well deserves its name. Blackdown House, just over the border of the parish, in Lods worth, is one of the most romanticady situated mansions in West Sussex. It was partly built in 1640, by Widiam Yaldwin, Esq., who was High Sheriff ofthe county in 1656, and a partisan of Cromwell ; and from this circumstance tradition has inti mately associated Blackdown with that personage. The estate belonged for eight generations to the Yaldwins, from William Yaldwin, who died in 1590, to the present William Henry Yaldwyn, Esq., who has recently sold it to James Henry, Esq. The manors in the parish are Diddlesfold and River. About half the great stag park of Petworth is in Lurgashall, and the lords of Petworth have until lately paid a modus of a fat buck and doe to the parson, who at present receives \u00a310 in lieu thereof. The church (St. Lawrence) consists of a nave and chancel, with a tower and shingled spire on the south side. The chancel (Early English) was rebuilt some years since, and the tower is of the Perpendicular period. Adjoining the south porch, to the west, is an open cloister of timber frame, which is said to have been built for the accommodation of remote parishioners who therein ate their dinner between matins and evensong. The nave, in 1866, 7, underwent thorough preservation, and in the course of removing the plaster from both sides of the wads, very ancient herringbone masonry, and a north door (I think unquestionably Saxon) were discovered. On the plaster inside"], [357, "LYMINSTER. 37 were disclosed three rude coats of arms, probably of the 14th century. I. Ten annulets, 4, 3, 2, 1 ; II. Five fusils\u2014 Dawtry of Petworth. III. Chequy \u2014 the arms of Lewes Priory. The last coat is accounted for by the fact that Seffrid IL, Bishop of Chiehester, 1180-1204, granted this church to the Priory of Lewes, which held it until the Dissolution. The budding, which is full of interesting features, contains many memorials for the Yaldwyns of Blackdown. The parish reckons among its rectors a William Cobden, James Bramston, author of \" The Art of Politics,\" and Nicholas Turner, brother of Charlotte Smith. (See \"Worthies of Sussex,\" pp. 58 and 15.) In this parish and that of Chiddingfold, just over the Surrey border, are to be found various members of the supposed Saxon family of Enticknapp, now in j)lebeian condition, and caded by their neighbours and themselves Emlet.

Vulgo, Limster; a parish in the Hundred of Poling ; Eape of Arundel; near its Post-town, Arundel. Union, East Preston. Population in 1811, 554 ; in 1861, 801. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at \u00a3350 ; Patron, the Bishop of London ; Incumbent, Bev. Matthew Enraght, M.A., of Trinity College, Dublin. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1556. Acreage, 3,230. There are several excellent mansions and residences in the parish, and in its tything Warningcamp. The etymology of this name is \" Leonis monasterium,\" the convent of St. Leo. It is found in records as Lolinminster, and sometimes Nonneminster, from a nunnery which existed here in ancient times. About half the parish is meadow and brook land, in the valley of the Arun. The earliest mention of the place is in the wid of King Alfred, who bequeaths it to his nephew Osferd. Whether this place or the town in Hereford- shire is the place from which Suane, son of Earl Godwin, in- veigled the Abbess,is uncertain. (See Pevensey.) From Domesday it appears that it was held in demesne by the Confessor, and after the Conquest by Earl Roger. It then contained twenty hides never taxed. There were forty-four ploughlands, sixty-eight villeins, and forty-three cottagers, a church, a mill, and two salt-pans, and wood for thirty swine. Its value was \u00a350. Robert held a smad estate, which, temp . Confessor, had belonged to Azor, and was worth 10s. The manor fodowed the descent of the earldom of Arundel,"], [358, "38 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. until it was transferred by sale, temp. Elizabeth, to Richard Knight, of Chawton, co. Hants. In 1679 it devolved by the wife of Sir Richard Knight to Richard Martin, son of Michael Martin, by Frances, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Christopher Lewknor, after a circuitous descent through female heirs, whose husbands successively took the name of Knight. In 1786, T. May Knight, Esq., sold the manor to Charles Goring, Esq., of Wiston, with whose representative it remains. Couetwick, formerly called \" Powers in Wyke,\" was granted by Henry III. to Stephen le Power, and it descended in the female line to the Apsleys and Bedinghams. At the Reformation it belonged to the monastery of Tewkesbury, and was granted by Henry VIII. to Robert Palmer, of Parham. By his descend ant it was conveyed in 1722 to James Colebrook, whose son sold it in 1772 to Richard Bagnall, by whom it was sold in 1774 to Richard Wyatt, Esq., and his great grandson, Hugh Wyatt, Esq., LL.D., is the present owner. Tottington is mentioned in Domesday as a distinct manor, though held like Lyminster by Azor and by Robert. Totentune was rated at four hides ; before the Conquest it was rated at 60s., afterwards at 70s. It is now a hamlet lying in the south east part of the parish adjacent to Little-Hampton. It belongs to the Duke of Norfolk. Waeningcamp is a district or tything comprising about a third part of the parish, and is bounded by the Arun. Turgod held \" Warnecha \" ofthe Confessor, and after the Conquest Nigellus held it. This also was rated at four hides. Temp. Confessoris it was worth 60s., afterwards 20s., then 50s., so that some calamity probably befel it at the Norman invasion. The manor of Blake hurst, which contains the whole of Warningcamp, has been possessed by Morley, Geere, Cheale, Whitbread, and Margesson. It is now annexed to the demesne of Arundel Castle. The area is 919 acres, and the population in 1861 was 107. Warningcamp was anciently a distinct parish, but it seems to have been eccle siasticady united with Lyminster before 1292. It is mentioned as a chapelry in 1492. The church or chapel was on the hdl to the north-west of the hamlet, but the last vestiges were removed in 1847, when a cottage was erected on the site. Batworth Park is an ancient appendage to Arundel Castle. It is loftily situated, and commands a fine view of the Castle. Cavalry barracks were built here in 1800, but have been removed. The Nunnery of Lyminster was of the Benedictine order, founded on the basis of the Saxon establishment by an early member of the De Montgomeri family, soon after the Conquest. The church and demesnes were then given to the nuns of Almanesche in Normandy, also founded by Roger de Montgomeri,"], [359, "39 MADEHURST. and it continued to be a ced. The convent consisted of a prioress and four nuns. Temp. Henry V. the possessions were confis cated, and later the impropriate tythes were granted as part of the foundation of Eton College. It is now held by lessees. The site of the nunnery has been built upon, and no trace of the ancient walls is left. The Chart farm, formerly part of the monastic estate, passed through a succession of owners to the widely-spread and numerous West Sussex family of Duke. The church (St. Mary Magdalen) comprises west tower, nave,. with north aisle and porch, and an unusually long chancel. The tower is Transition Norman, but the greater part of the budding is Early English, with Perpendicular insertions. There is a musical peal of six bells. The chancel arch is of peculiar con struction, and very lofty. I have not seen this building, but from Mr. Hussey's account of it, it has many points of interest, though Dallaway describes it as of \"the coarse parochial archi tecture,\" whatever that may mean. It contains monuments for the families of Blake, Groome, Wyatt, &c. In ancient times there were in this small church altars dedicated respectively to Our Lady and SSS. Stephen, John, and Catherine.* The Priory of Ptneham or De Calceto, like Warningcamp, has long been annexed to this parish. See Pyneham. [S.A.C. Domesday watermills, v, 271.

His son aliened it to Thomas Read Kemp, Esq., M.P., who re-sold it to John Smith, Esq., M.P. It is now the property and seat of John Charles Fletcher, Esq. The church (St. Mary Magdalen), described by Dallaway as \" of the plainest architecture,\" was repaired in 1864, when a north aisle and a new chancel were added, chiefly at the charge of the patron.

The prebendary has usually leased the site and lands for three lives, and thus the families of Juxon, Brereton, Longcroft, Barwell, and Woods, have been lessees. It is now in the hands of W.

In later times it belong to the Jenmans and Peckhams, and from the latter it has descended to Admiral Sir Phipps Hornby. \" The church,\" says Horsfield, \" has nothing requiring re mark.\" It certainly deserves notice for the apsidal termination of the chancel, which marks it of the Early Norman period. There are not more than four or five other instances of the apsis in the parish churches of Sussex. The rest of the building appears to be Early English. [S. A. C. Church, xvi, 134.

The history of this parish has been fully written in the \" Sussex Collections,\" by the Rev. Edward Turner, Rector. The soil varies from a stiff loam to a light sand, while Ashdown Forest, a large portion of which lies in the parish, belongs to the iron-sand formation, and is very barren. Its want of fer tility is, in some measure, compensated by scenic beauty. The shape ofthe parish is irregular; its lengthfrom south east tonorth west being fully seven miles, while its average breadth is two only. A nearly isolated part, called Stumbletts, bordering on West Hothly and East Grinstead, hes in a deep forest dell, and not far from their parish churches. Here dwed about forty of the Maresfield folk at a distance of 6^ miles from the parish church. This hamlet and Pippingford warren are both alluded to by Horace Smith, in \" Brambletye.\" Of the origin of the name of Maresfield we can only guess. In ancient documents it is spelt Marrysfeld, and Marysfield. As Mr. Turner conjectures, the district may formerly have been dedicated to St. Mary, though the church has now another invocation."], [362, "42 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The church (St. Bartholomew), which, with the village, stands near the southern limit of the parish, is ofthe Perpendicular style, but has clearly been engrafted on a much earlier budding, portions ofthe chancel and the east window being Decorated. It consists of a chancel, nave, and west embattled tower. The architecture is very simple, but the interior, the walls of which were originally covered with paintings in distemper, is much en cumbered by a heavy gallery, and the Shedey pew. In the chancel are a piscina, and three iron grave-slabs, one of which is dated 1667. There are more recent records of the names of Michell, Kidder, &c. The tower contains six modern bells. The north porch, removed some years since from its original position, has some bold oak carving. The seats in the parish are of no great antiquity. The prin cipal is Maresfield Park. The house, which was caded \" The Cross,\" was the residence of the Newnham family, from whom it came to Sir John Shelley, father of the late Sir John Villiers Shelley, Bart., formerly M.P. for Westminster. Sir John Shelley having inherited the estate through his mother, Wdhelmina, daughter and heiress of John Newnham, Esq., added to the old house, and made it a competent residence. It includes a library, sixty feet in length. The family of De Newenham is of great anticpiity in the district, as appears from documents of temp. Edward III., and earlier. Another house, upon a larger scale, is Twyford Lodge, near Stumbletts, before mentioned. It was built by the late General Sewed, who inherited the estate from his uncle, William Sewed, Esq., one of the six Clerks in Chancery. In the 17th century, William Newnham, Esq., purchased a large tract of Ashdown Forest, called Pippingford, which he enclosed and partiady planted. It subsequently passed, by sale, first to William Bradford, Esq., and then to Henry Shirley, Esq. The latter made large additions to the house, wliich was burnt down in 1836. The estate subsequently became the property of John Mortimer, Esq., who built a spacious house, which commands extensive views over the adjacent wdd and romantic scenery. Forest Lodge is another modern house, the residence of Captain Widiam Noble ; and Twyford Abbey is that of Robert Trotter, Esq. The only two houses of considerable antiquity are, 1st, \" The Park,\" now a farm house, with few ancient features. This was the residence in the 16th and 17th centuries of the family of Rootes, or Rutes, a name of frequent occurrence in this district. Originally it possessed a well-timbered park. The present Mares field Park, then, is a modern substitution for \" The Cross.\" The lands, with the advowson of the church, formed part of the estate of Viscount Gage, until 1850, when they were purchased by Sir J. V. Shelley. 2nd, \"Marshads.\" The property, doubt-"], [363, "43 MARESFIELD. less, belonged originally to a branch of the ancient Sussex family of Marescal or Marshall, some of whose members served the office of Sheriff as early as temp. Richard I. and John. In much later times it would seem to have belonged to the Relfes, and it afterwards came to the Nutts, a branch of the family settled at Mays, in Selmeston, in the 1 7th century. By one of the Nutts the present stone mansion was built during the Stuart period. From the last of that family it passed to the Holfords, and it afterwards came by purchase to Sir John V. Shedey, Bart. A large house, built in the last century by Mr. Widiam Newnham, was called Street House. It stood opposite the church, but was pulled down by the late Sir J. V. Shedey, when the entrance gate to his grounds, a building in the medieval taste, was erected. The famdy of Kidder were of long standing in the parish. They were here, according to Mr. Turner, temp. Edward IL, and one at least of them was Badiff of Ashdown. They sent off branches to East Grinstead, Lewes, and many other places ; one branch went to the United States. Richard Kidder, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was of this stock. The Manor of Duddleswell, partly in Maresfield, belongs to the Earl de la Warr, and there are copious records respecting it among the Burrell MSS. On a command ing site at Duddleswell stands the elegant residence of Elphin stone Barchard, Esq. In this parish are two excellent nursery gardens, belonging respectively to Mr. Wood and Mr. Mitchell. The latter is widely renowned for its roses, and for the finest specimens of the Araucaria imbricata known in England. There were three considerable iron-works in Maresfield; at Old Land ; at the Old Forge, near Lampool ; and at the Forge, at the south extremity of the parish, on the site now occupied by gunpowder works. At Old Land the scori\u00e6, or refuse of the smelted iron, known as \"cinders,\" cover many acres of land, in beds varying from three to six feet in thickness. That the works were carried on here by the Romans at a very early period of their dominion in Britain, I have fully shown in vol. ii. of the \" Sussex Codections.\" Remains of that people in coins, fibul\u00e6, Samian, and other pottery, were found in these cinder-beds in and before the year 1844, when the cinders were much employed in the repair of roads in the neighbourhood. At the \" Old Forge\" cannon Avere cast, and balls have frequently been found in the neighbouring proof-bank. Among the learned rectors of Maresfield was the Rev. Henry Michell, who held the living for fifty years, and the vicarage of Brighton for forty-five. He was instituted to the benefice in 1739. His great erudition is well known, and his friend Clarke, of Buxted, characterized him as a man of great taste and sound judgment, who \" read Greek in tbe country.\" (See Memoir in"], [364, "44 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 230.) The rectory of Maresfield, at the time ofthe Non\u00e6 Return in 1342, had considerable rights in the chase of Ashdown, including pasturage for twenty head of cattle, and pannage for twenty-four hogs, so that we may con clude that the parson had a wed-stored larder. There are many other matters of interest in Mr. Turner's paper, to which I beg to refer the reader. [S. A. C, including the references to Ashdown and Nutley.

M. Kirby, &c. Of Mayfield, Mr. Dun-ant Cooper remarks : \u2014 \" This is the ground of Sussex miracles and wonders. The very name of Loxfield reminds us ofthe evil spirit; whilst here it was that St. Dunstan, finding the orientation of his first wooden church rather defective, placed his shoulder to the corner, according to Eadmer, and left it due East and West ; and here, too, whdst at work at the forge, turning a horse-shoe, he perceived the ' old gentleman ' (in the guise of a beautiful lady) at his anvil, and seizing him by the nose made him vanish.\"* The legend goes * S.A.C. Vol. xxi., p. 1."], [365, "45 MAYFIELD. on to state that when the Saint had the foul fiend wed in the grasp of his tongs the latter flew away with him, and he, with the pertinacity which always distinguished him, hung on to the demon for the distance of three mdes, and at length descended at a place still called Dunstan's Bridge. The pincers, anvil, and hammer of the Saint are yet preserved in the ante-chapel of the Palace, and they were formerly regarded as irrefragable evidence of the truth of the legend ! St. Dunstan certainly had a mansio or resting-place at May field, and he was doubtless founder of the original church pre viously to the year 988, the date of his death. Subsequent Archbishops of Canterbury enlarged Dunstan's palace untd it became one ofthe stateliest edifices in the South of England, and was able to give reception to royalty. King Edward I. visited it on several occasions, 1297, 1305. Simon deMeopham, Arch bishop, and his successor both died here, and it was here that, in 1332, a Council* for the regulation of Saints' days was held. Numerous deeds, ranging from 1294, to the date of the Refor mation, prove that Mayfield (Magafelda) was a favourite resi dence of the Primates, who held it until Cranmer surrendered it together with the manor, park, and good lands, to Henry VIII. About the year 1350 Archbishop Islip erected the magni ficent hall, and many of the other buildings still remaining. The had itself is 70 feet by 39, and 60 feet high to the apex of the roof. Some parts of the Palace are iD the Perpendicular style of the early part of the 16th century. The ensemble before the date of the Reformation must have been very grand. Besides the great had there was a quadrangle at the east end, with projections in the form of square towers. To the south of the Palace the gate-house still remains ; it is of the 15th century, and has a lofty pointed arch, now partly blocked up. To return to the hall, it was stripped of its roof towards the end of the last century, and for many years the three grand supporting arches open to the weather re mained, one of the finest specimens of the noble and picturesque in Gothic architecture. The character of the building has been well described in Vol. ii. of the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Col lections,\" and in Vol. xxiii. of the \"Journal of the British Arch\u00e6ological Asssociation,\" and to them I must refer for many exceedingly interesting details. A short time since, when the Palace was partially restored for the purpose of using it as a Convent, the roof was reinstated, and what was for ages the banqueting-hall of the Archbishops was refitted as a chapel for the Roman-Catholic Sisterhood. Another principal apartment of the Palace bears the name of Queen Elizabeth's room, from * This was called Concilium Ulaghfcldense."], [366, "46 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. the tradition that that sovereign occupied it during a temporary visit to Mayfield. Another feature of the building is a remark ably strong and massive staircase of stone, leading from the ground floor to the upper apartments. No traces of the true original chapel remain. After the alienation ofthe Palace by Cramner, in 1545, Sir John Gresham purchased it, and members of his family held it, and occasionally resided here. Among the number was Sir Thomas Gresham, the founder of the Royal Exchange, whose crest, the grasshopper, appears with the date 1571, in \" Queen Elizabeth's room.\" In 1579 the Palace and estate were devised to Sir Henry Neville, who appears to have resided at Mayfield, but in 1597 he sold the palace and manor to Thomas May, Esq., of the Franchise in Burwash, whose wife and son sold them in 1 61 7 to John Baker, Esq., in whose descendants they long vested. In 1863 the Duchess of Leeds bought the Palace for conventual purposes, and the adaptation of the buildings to that use was entrusted to Mr. Pugin. The hundred and manor were separated from the Palace, and passed from the Bakers through the Pel hams to the Marquis Camden in 1790. The park, called Frankham, for the archiepiscopal venison, was upwards of 400 acres in extent, while the fishponds, measur ing 9 acres, attested, as Mr. Cooper observes, \" the care for the welfare of the most reverend prelates on fast days.\" Mayfield parish is divided into four districts, called quarters, namely, Town, Moushill, Five-ash, and Bibleham. The last-named was formerly called Bivelham, and was the seat of iron-works when this and the neighbouring parishes were largely engaged in that industry. To the iron trade succeeded hop-growing, and in 1837 no less than 614 acres of hop-gardens existed. Thename of Cade prevailed in this parish for many generations, John being the favourite pr\u00e6nomen. * This goes far to confirm the statement that Jack Cade, the rebel, who was slain in the adjacent parish of Heathfield in 1450, was an East Sussex man, and not an Irishman, as some of our chroniclers assert. Thomas May, the poet, and historian of the Long Parliament, son of the purchaser of the estate from Sir H. Neville, lived in his early days at Mayfield, and Sir Thomas Jenner, the celebrated lawyer and judge, first saw the light in this parish in 1638. Mayfield parish contains, besides the manor of its own name, those of Isenhurst, which was formerly part of the possessions of Michelham Priory, and at later dates the property of the families of Baker, Kirby, and Treherne ; and Bibleham, long in the possession of the Pelhams, but now belonging to the Right Hon.

Besides the visit of Queen Elizabeth to Mayfield (1573) to see the great merchant-prince, Sir Thomas Gresham, this old town has had the honour of entertaining royalty in our own times. In 1833 Queen (then Princess) Victoria spent a few hours in surveying the principal objects of this ancient place. The church, dedicated to St. Dunstan, together with a large part of the town, was burnt down in 1389. The nave, aisles, and choir, and also a chantry, dedicated to St. Alban, were de stroyed, but the tower, which is now crowned with a shingled spire, retains traces of Early English architecture. The re building of the fabric took place early in the 15th century, and has some very interesting features, including two piscin\u00e6 and a hagioscope. The central window, which escaped the fi/e, is in the flamboyant style. Among the vicars may be named (1.) John de Wickliffe, appointed 1361, and who has been mistaken for the great Reformer. (2.) George Carleton, afterwards Bishop of Llandaff, from whence he was translated to Chiehester. (3.) John May nard, of an old family of Rotherfield. One of bis an cestors, William Maynard, was burnt at Lewes for Protestant ism in 1557.* This vicar, who was appointed one of the A ssembly of Divines, lies buried in the church-yard, and his epitaph assures us that \" he shone for 40 years the light and glory of this church of Mayfield.\" Within the church are numerous in scriptions to the names of Baker, extending over many genera tions, while other names occurring on the various monuments are Cole, Roberts, Farnden, Houghton, Grant, Aynscombe, Godfrey, Rivers, etc. There are six bells.

This house of Augustinian canons, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was founded in the parish of Arlington shortly before the year 1229, by Gilbert de Aquda, whose ancestor, Engenulf de 1' Aigle, came over with the Conqueror, and, \" with shield slung at his neck, and gallantly handling his spear, struck down many ofthe English.\" (Roman de Rou.) The De Aquilas were for several generations lords of Pevensey Castle and its Rape. This place is supposed to have derived its name from Gislebertus Magnus (Anglo-Saxon mice!) and ham, abode or home. The foundation charter confers on the canons his lordship of Michel ham, with its park, villeins, and rents ; and lands in Hadsham, Willingdon, the Dicker, the Broyle, and other woods in Sussex, with pastures for sixty beasts, and pannage for a hundred hogs, as also the manor of Chyngton in Seaford, where the brethren had afterwards a grange and chapel. A ftdl account of the charters, royal confirmations, &c, relating to this priory is given in Vol. vi. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" by the Rev. G. Miles Cooper. To this new foundation many knightly and gentle famihes afterwards became benefactors, giving lands in \"la Knocke \" (retained in Knock-hatch, one of the ancient entrances to Michelham Park), Kelle, Jevington, Brighthelmston (whence the manor of Brighthelmston-Michelham), Ditton in Westham, Willingdon, Isinghurst in Mayfield, Horsted-Keynes, Hartfield, and Cowden. The churches of Laughton and Hailsham were also attached to the foundation. In 1398 the conventual build ings appear to have been in bad condition, consequent upon in undations of the sea on their lands, and as a means of assistance the churches of Alfriston and Fletching were appropriated to the establishment. Thenceforward the priory appears to have possessed a competent revenue, and the prior had forest rights with herbage and pannage in Wilmington, Clavregge in Waldron, Hawkehurste in East Hothly, the Dicker, the Broyle, Waldron, Bromeknoll in Ashdown Forest, and Laughton. There is but httle history attached to this monastery, except occasional law suits. Inl302,EdwardI.,on oneof his southern progresses, passed a night at the priory. At or just before the dissolution the brethren were eight in number. That event occurred in 1537, when the income was valued at \u00a3191 19s. 3d. The priory was erected on a rich aduvial soil, in the vadey of the river Cuckmere, which was here made a spacious square moat with upwards of five acres of water, enclosing an area of eight acres. The situation is extremely picturesque, and the remains of the conventual buildings are still considerable. The gateway continues entire, and is one of the most interesting VOL. II.

It is an embattled tower about 50 feet in height, with four square-headed windows, and a wide entrance, with a depressed arch, apparently of the fifteenth century. The house itself, having always been inhabited, retains many ancient features. The south side presents a handsome elevation of great length, and on the north side are the remains of the chapel of good Early English work, though much mutilated. The crypt remains uuchanged with its groining ribs almost intact. There is a small narrow passage with Early English ribs, and con nected with it is a curious recess called \" Isaac's Hole,\" which is conjectured to have been a penitentiary. After the dissolu tion Michelham became a private residence and was occupied by the families of Marshall, Pelham, &c. It eventually became the property of the Sackvilles, in whose representatives it is still vested. To the lover of the picturesque and the antiquary, Michelham offers a treat rarely to be met with in the south of England. MIDDLETON.

This parish has suffered greatly from the encroachments of the sea. Between 1292 and the date of the Non\u00e6 roll, 1341, forty acres of arable land had disappeared. Since then much greater ravages have occurred. Altogether it is estimated that since the Conquest more than half the parish has been absorbed. The church (St. Nicholas), which originally stood in the centre of the parish, is mentioned by Cartwright in 1832 as a small, low building. \" The south aisle, tower, and half the chancel,\" he says, \" with the whole south side of the churchyard, have been absorbed, and are now covered with shingle.\" Since that time the building has entirely disappeared, and a new church was erected in 1849. Charlotte Smith's sonnet on Middleton church has often been quoted. A reef of rocks, called Middle ton ledge, projecting more than a mile from the shore, points out the foimer sea margin.

Acreage, 671. Midhurst is one of the many interesting spots with which West Sussex abounds, and, though not rich in historical associa tions, possesses much picturesque beauty, and a most salubrious climate. The notion that it represents a Roman station called Miba or Mida is utterly groundless. The name is Saxon, from middan and hirst, and signifies a place in the midst of woody ground. The town, which lies on the south bank of the Rother, consists principady of North Street, the rising ground known as Rumbold's Hill, and West Street. Midhurst is not mentioned in Domesday, as at that period it was probably included, both manoriadyand ecclesiastically, in Easebourne. In the reign of Henry I., Savaric de Bohun obtained 4\u00a3 knights' fees, and held of the honour of Arundel. By that monarch it was erected into a minor barony or lordship, and was held of the King. Temp. Edward I., Walter, Lord Beke of Eresby, was in posses sion, with remainder to the De Bohuns.* John de Bohun was summoned to Parliament as Baron of Midhurst, probably in re ward of his services in Flanders and at Cressy, but after his death, in 1367, this peerage seems to have discontinued. His descendant, John de Bohun, died without male issue, and his estates here and elsewhere passed, temp. Henry VII., to his two daughters and co-heiresses, Mary, wife of Sir David Owen, natural son of Owen Tudor, grandfather of Henry VTL, and Ursula, wife of Robert Southwed, of Suffolk. Upon a hid rising above the Rother stood the baronial castle of the De Bohuns, with its chapel of ' St. Anne, the site being now overgrown with * In 1278 the demesne is described as containing a messuage, two parks, and two mills. E 2"], [372, "52 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. stately trees. From the dedication of the chapel, the place supposed to have been deserted as early as the reign of Edward III., is still called St. Anne's-hill, vulgo, \" Tan Hill.\" King Ed ward I. visited Midhurst in 1286, 1299, and 1305. In the last mentioned year his son, the first Prince of Wales, stayed here four days in order to overtake his father, whom he had offended. The names of Butler and Hoad, still retained at Midhurst, seem to represent those of Le Botiler and Ode, who are mentioned in the records relating to the visit of the \" long-shanked king.\" Midhurst is a borough by prescription. It sent two members to Parliament from temp. Edward II. ; but in 1832 it was limited to one, and even to secure that one, it was necessary to annex several adjacent parishes. Two or three personages well known to fame have represented the borough, including Charles James Fox, and, more recently, Samuel Warren, Q.C., author of \" Ten Thousand a Year,\" &c. The patronage of the borough has passed through the families of Fagg, Peachey, Knight, and the Lords Montague, to that of Smith, J. Abel Smith, M.P., being the present owner. There were formerly about 120 burg age tenements, which entitled their respective owners to vote. One of the Lords Montague pulled some of them down that he might enlarge Cowdray Park, but had stones inscribed \"a Burgage \" put into the wall to indicate their sites, whereupon a noble duke remarked that \" so low had the elective franchise fallen, that at Midhurst the very stones appeared as voters for members of Parliament !\" The Knights of St. John of Jerusa lem had a Commandery here, probably as successors to the Knights-Templars, when the latter order was dissolved by King Edward II. They had jurisdiction over a district still known as the Liberty of St. John, which is independent of both the borough and manor of Midhurst. After the Reformation it was granted in 1542 to Sir William Fitz-William, K.G. The liberty extends into several neighbouring parishes. The church, dedicated, according to ancient wids, to St. Mary Magdalen, but popularly ascribed to St. Denis, is a chapel-of ease to Easebourne. The budding, which is neither very ancient nor imposing, is principally of the Perpendicular style of temp. Henry VI. It consists of nave, chancel, and two smad aisles on the south side separated by a tower, the lower part of which appears to be either Norman or very Early English. The west aisle or chapel, built by the executors of William, Earl of Southampton, contained a costly monument to the first Lord Montague and his two wives, but this has been removed. In 1422 Henry Bageley or Baggele founded in this church a brotherhood and a chantry for his soul. Mr. Cooper informs us that he became a Lodard, and was burnt in Smithfield in 1431. There is now"], [373, "53 MILLAND. MILTON STREET. little of interest within the building, and the existing monu ments are for the families of Mellish, Cresswell, Bailey, Fisher, Shirley, Bridgman, Morrison, Golding, Robson, Upperton, &c. The tower contains six bells. A grammar-school was founded here in 1672 by Mr. Gilbert Hannam, a coverlet-maker, for \"12 poore men's sonnes,\" who must be neither Romanists nor Dis senters. The school arose upon this foundation to be one of the best in the county. Three Bailys (all D.D.'s) were in succession head-masters ; and in the time of the first Dr. Baily the private scholars numbered 70. Richard Cobden and Sir Charles Lyell were boys here. The building was enlarged by successive masters, but of late, by reason of internal mismanagement, the school has been disused, and, when I last visited the school house, nearly every window of it had been broken by stone throwers. There are several excellent residences within and about the town. At Todham formerly stood a mansion, contain ing a chapel, built in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by George Denis. It contained the arms of Denis, Rose, Pelham, &c. W. D.

The manor is an infeudation of Echingham. Gode held it of the Confessor, but after the great Survey, Reinbert held Montifelle of the Earl of Eu. Temp. Henry HI., and probably earlier, it belonged to the family of Sokeners. In that reign William, son and heir of Roger Sokeners, granted to Benedict, son of Robert de Hokestepe, the lands of Westdune and Loleland in this manor. The Hokestepe family (whose name is now cor rupted to Huckstepp) are of great antiquity in these parts. In 23rd Edward I. William de Echingham was lord, and the manor continued with his descendants untd 1468. From the Tyrwhitts, who inherited from that baronial race, it passed to the family of English, who about the year 1660 sold it to that of Nicholl, in whose possession it remained until within the last few years. The manor of Fame or Vinehad, anciently Fynhawe, gave name to the family of De Fynhawe, who ultimately wrote themselves Vinall, settled at Kingston near Lewes, and became extinct about the end ofthe 17th century. It afterwards belonged to the family of Dunk, and then to that of Davis. It has lately passed by sale from Mr. Tilden Smith to W. R. Adamson, Esq., by whom it has been re-named Rushton Park, and the mansion possesses every appliance of luxury, including gas made on the spot, and commands a fine view. Glattingham is another reputed manor. In a wood upon it, called the Castle Wood, remains of an ancient moated mansion were traceable not long since. The site, with a"], [375, "55 NORTH MMMUNDHAMM. few acres of land, though locally in Mountfield, belongs to the parish of Echingham. The property called Walters belonged successively to the families of Hickes, Dunmod, Mercer, and Durrant. In 1863 a remarkable discovery was made in an enclosure caded Barn Field, in this parish. It consisted of torques, pen annular rings, &c, of solid gold, which may have formed the per sonal ornaments of a King or Druid of the Celtic period. This treasure-trove, estimated to weigh nearly thirteen pounds, and worth \u00a3650 sterling, was discovered by a ploughman, and sold by him as old brass for 6d. per pound. The purchasers, who knew the value, sold their nefarious prize to a refiner in London, who consigned it to the melting pot ! This is one of the most serious losses that Sussex arch\u00e6ology ever sustained ; but it is satisfactory to state that after an inquest made by the coroner ofthe district, and criminal proceedings taken at Lewes Assizes, the guilty parties, Thomas and Willet, were imprisoned in the county gaol until payment of the value of their plunder (as sessed at =\u00a3530) should be paid. The refiner himself ought, per haps, to have gone through the fiery trial of a prosecution for such barbarous destruction of historical remains. Sixteen yeomen and labourers of this parish were concerned in Jack Cade's ris ing, 1450. The church (All Saints) was restored some years since, chiefly at the cost of Earl de la Warr. It consists of a chancel, nave, and bell-turret, with an ancient bell inscribed to St. Augustine. The style is Early English. On a window in the nave are the arms of Echingham, and on the font is a shield with three escadops (2 and 1), a coat which occurs at Dadington, Roberts bridge, &c. There is a monument for the Hicks family. [S. A. C. Ironworks, iii, 245. Weekes of, iron-masters, xi, 82. Church, xiii, 136. Gold ornaments found (Combe), xv. vii, 238. xvi, 310.

Seats, Buncton House, Miss Merricks ; Mundham House, Mrs. Hollingdale. A pleasant sequestered village on a fertile soil. God a, the mother of Harold, held the manor of Edward the Confessor. After the Conquest it was part of the barony of Earl Roger de Montgomeri. It had a church and 2\u00a3 mills. At a later date it was possessed by Robert de Monte Alto, and descended to the St. Johns. In more recent times the Lords La Warr, the Bowyers, Coverts, Balletts, and Breretons held it. Rochin tone, presumed to be the same as Runcton, is also mentioned in Domesday. At the Dissolution, Mundham and Runcton were purchased by Thomas Bowyer, an eminent citizen of London, whose family had been connected with Sussex from the time of Henry IV. It has been for three generations in the family of Merricks. It formerly had a chapel. Leythorne, in this parish, was one of the manors of Bishop Sherburne, who bequeathed it to the Dean and Chapter of Chiehester. Sir Thomas Bowyer, a great Royalist, rebuilt the house in stately fashion. It was destroyed in 1798. A younger branch of the Bowyers had the estate of Vhiitrow in this parish. Brimfast, another small estate, was part of the grant of Ceadwalla to Bishop Wilfred ; and Fishers belonged to the family of Merlot. The church (St. Stephen) consists of nave, chancel, north and south aisles under one roof span, and embattled west tower. It is a rude, picturesque building, with Norman, Early English, and later features. Dallaway says that the chapel of St. Mary Magda lene was founded by a member ofthe St. John family of Halnaker, before 1348, at the end of the north aisle. There are several curious monuments and inscriptions for the families of Bowyer, Cassey, Byrch, Evans, Woodyer, Covert, Newland, and Bigs. [S. A. C. Bowyer of Leythorne, v, 47. xvi, 50.

A considerable estate, extending into the parishes of Findon, Sullington, and Washington. It belonged from early times (46th Edward III.) to a family of the same name, whose original habitat appears to have been in the parish of Itchingfield, this being an outlying portion of their manor. In 12th Henry VI. John Apsley was owner ; and in 1st Edward VI. it belonged to his descendant, Nicholas Apsley, whose son sold it to the Shedey"], [377, "57 NETHERFIELD. NEWHAVEN. family. Later it was owned by the families of Crowe, Middle ton, and Montague. In 1 765 it became the property of Wdliam Frankland, Esq., of the baronet family of Thirkleby, co. York, and a descendant, through female lines, of Oliver Cromwell. The house, which Hes in a deep ded, was built by Anthony, Viscount Montague, as a hunting-box. Mr. Frankland (who had been, for those days, an adventurous spirit, having for some time resided at Bengal, returned, in the character of a tatar or messenger, and visited Bagdad, Jerusalem, the site of Babylon, Palmyra, and many other places) greatly enlarged the house. There he employed himself in mechanical pursuits, and made his habitation a kind of museum for organs, turning lathes, looms, &c, at the cost of more than \u00a320,000. He pur sued his favourite tastes at Muntham for 40 years of his life, and died in 1 805, more than 84 years of age. He had a good codection of pictures dlustrative of his descent from Cromwell. NETHERFIELD. A hamlet in the parish of Battle, giving name to a hundred. The qualifying nether I could never understand, as the place is seated on high ground, and from it the coast of France may be clearly discerned. A memorial church (St. John the Baptist), with parsonage-house and schools, was erected here about 1860, by Sarah Lady Webster, for her husband, Sir Godfrey Webster, Bart., of Battle Abbey. This is a great accommodation for many of the outlying inhabitants of Battle. The patron is the Bishop of Chiehester, and the present Incumbent is the Rev. Thomas Partington, M.A. NEWHAVEN (otherwise Meeching). A parish in the Hundred of Holmstrow ; Bape of Lewes ; distant 6^ miles south of Lewes, its Post-town. It has two railway stations on a branch ofthe South Coast line ; and gives name to a Union. Popula- tion in 1811, 755; in 1861, 1,886. Benefice, a Bectory, valued at \u00a3186 ; Patron and Incumbent, Eev. Ebenezer P. Southwood, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1553. Acreage, 1,217. What was, three hundred years since, the village of Meeching has, both previously and since, undergone considerable vicissi tudes \u2014 greater perhaps than any other place on the Sussex coast. The natural embouchure of the estuary of the Ouse was here in early times, and during the days of Roman occupa tion it was of sufficient importance to be defended by massive"], [378, "58 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. earthworks, the remains of which we see on the western side of the present port, and known as Castle Hill. The inroads of the sea greatly altered the contour of the coast at this point, and for centuries the ancient bed of the river was driven, by the accumulation of shingle, three miles eastward, to Seaford, which thus became an important haven. In the 16th century, by the application of art, the Ouse was made to debouch at or near its ancient point, and at New-Haven it has become more recently one of the principal harbours on our coast. Some antiquaries have fixed here the commencement of the great Roman via, known as the Ermin Street. At the present time it is one of the principal ports for communication between London and Paris, on by far the most direct route. Powerful steamers daily ply between it and Dieppe, and it has a considerable coasting traffic. With a further outlay of money and engineering skill, its advantages might be greatly increased, and some sanguine minds have fixed here \" the Liverpool of the South.\" Govern- ment authority has been brought to bear, and a fort of enormous strength to mount 42 guns is in course of construction on the Castle Hid; the total cost, including accommodation for 300 men, is estimated at \u00a3150,000. During the necessary excavations attention has been drawn to the existence of an extensive \" kitchen-midden \" or dust heap of a Roman camp, containing broken potteiy, animal remains, and other relics of the past. The geological features of the cliff at Newhaven are very remark- able. It was at Newhaven that Louis-Philippe and his Queen landed on their escape from France in 1848. The town of Newhaven proper consists principally of one hdly street to the west of the Ouse ; another portion lies to the east of the river, and is in the parish of Denton. The manor of Meeching is not named in Domesday. It belonged to the De Warennes in the 14th century. Much later it was vested in the Gibbons, relatives of the historian. From him it passed to his friend, the Earl of Sheffield, father of the present noble proprietor. The church (St. Michael) stands on a hill to the west of the town. The western portion is recent and of no interest, but the tower, placed near the east end of the building, with a semi- circular apse is remarkable, and bears a striking resemblance to that of Yainvdle, near Jumieges in Normandy. It is probably one of the earliest Norman erections in England. On the north side of the church-yard is an obelisk commemorating 105 men, the Captain and crew of the Brazen, sloop of war, wrecked on the Ave rocks in this parish, in 1800. [S. A. C.

Benefice, a Bec- tory, valued at \u00a3387. Incumbent, Eev. William Powell, M.A., of Oriel College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1559. Acreage, 1,966. Seats, MNewick Park, James H. Sclater, Esq. ; Beechland, Thomas St. Leger Blaauw, Esq. ; Newick Lodge, M. T. Archer, Esq., &c. The surface of this parish is somewhat undulating, and has agreeably diversified scenery. There are several mineral springs near the Ouse, which runs through the parish. Newick Place or Park was formerly the seat of the Hon. George Vernon, lord of the manor. It is finely situated, and commands views of a wed-wooded and fertde country. Beechland, the residence of the late Wdliam Henry Blaauw, Esq., M.A., F.S.A., the accom plished Sussex Antiquary, is an elegant mansion. The Rectory is a delightful residence. All these houses are approached by avenues. Newick (novus vicus) does not seem to be of great antiquity. It is not mentioned in Domesday, but it may have been included in the manor of Barcombe, then Bercham. In 9th Edward I. it was held by John, Earl of Warenne, Ralph de Camoys, Simon de Petroponte, and the Prior of Lewes. In 28th Henry VI. the Prior of Lewes solely held Newyke. In 12th Elizabeth, it seems to have been a subinfeudation of the manor of Westmeston, as it is mentionened in the Burrell MSS. that \" the tenants of this manor have Jong time used to do their suit to the Lords of the manor of Westmeston, being six miles distant, which affirme their custumes to be in all things as in Westmeston.\" In 24th Ehzabeth, Gregory Fynes, Lord Dacre, and Lady Anne his wife, conveyed this manor with other lands to George Goring, Esq., of Lewes. Among subsequent lords have been the Boords of Cuckfield, Longley of London, Relfe, the Lords Mansed, and the Vernon family. Lord Vernon in 1791 had it for life. It was afterwards sold to Sir Elijah Impey, from whom it passed to James Powell, Esq. It is now the property of James Henry Sclater, Esq. Other manors extend into the parish. The church (St. Mary) consists of a chancel, nave with north"], [380, "60 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. aisle, (added about the year 1836). The south porch is in the Decorated style, as is also the west tower, which contains three bells. The chancel, is Early English, having Decorated windows under earlier arches. There are a piscina, and two sedilia, all rich. In the nave were formerly four small Norman windows, of which two and a Norman door were obliterated in erecting the aisle ; one window stid appears in the south wall. (Hussey.) The church contains memorials for members of the families of Vernon, Mansell, and others. The view from the leads ofthe tower over the Wealden district, especially towards the east, is remarkably fine. [S. A. C. Ironworks, ii, 215.

Post-town, Hurst-Pierpoint. Union, Cuckfield. Population in 1811, 173; in 1861,162. Benefice, a Eectory ; Patron, Arthur Pitman Gordon, Esq. ; Incumbent, Eev. A. Pitman Gordon, M.A., of Christ Church, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1558. Acreage, 1,663. Chief Landowners, Ch. H. Wm. Gordon, Esq., and Lord . Leconfield. Seat, Newtimber Place, C. H. W. Gordon, Esq. This parish lies at the northern foot of the South Downs. The scenery is bold and romantic, and there are many agreeable undulations of surface. The principal house is Newtimber Place, a brick building with remains of a moat. It has passed in modern times through the families of Osborne and Newnham, to that of Gordon, the present owners. Domesday Book informs us that Nivemhre belonged to William de Warenne. Previously it had been the fee of Alfech (Elphick?) an allodial tenant. It was rated at ten hides. There were fourteen videins, seven bondmen, a mid yielding 20d., and a wood for three hogs. Walter de Dunstanville gave Niewtymbre to his wife Dionysia. Alan de Dunstanville gave it to the monks of Lewes Priory to pray for the soul of his wife, but it would appear that a descendant of De Warenne claimed it by inheritance. Later it came to the great famdy of De Bohun. At the dissolution of the monas teries it was the property of Lewes Priory, and Henry VIII. granted it first to the vicar-general Cromwell, and afterwards to Anne of Cleves. In 15th Elizabeth, Edward Darell appears to have died seised of the manor. From the Dareds it came"], [381, "61 NINFIELD. to the family of Bellingham, then very influential in this dis trict. Subsequent owners have been Woodcock, Cust, Osborne, Newnham, and Gordon, the present possessors. The paramount lord of Newtimber is the Duke of Norfolk, in virtue of his descent from the De Warennes, the ancient lords of the Rape of Lewes. Another manor in this parish is Saddlescom.be, for which see a separate article. Interments of an ancient date \u2014 apparently warriors, each with a weapon by his side \u2014 were discovered near the earthwork caded Wolstonbury, in 1 765. The church (St. John the Evangelist) is small (probably of Early English date) and consists of a nave, chancel, and a square flint tower (date 1839) of rather good aspect, which boasts of one bell only. The budding contained some years since, a few remains of painted glass, as also a cross, the arms of De Bohun ; but not having visited this church I cannot say whether they still exist. There are inscriptions to the famdies of Osborne, Newnham, &c. The Countess de Priseche, who, with her husband the Count, had, after the French Revolution, been guests of G. L. Newnham, Esq., was buried in this church in 1793, and her coronet was suspended over her grave. [S. A. C. Parish register, iv, 275. Domesday mill, v, 271. Saddles combe, Knights-Templars of, ix, 227.

A parish in the Hundred of its own name ; Bape of Hastings ; distant ten miles north-west from Hastings. Post-town, Battle. Bailway station, Battle, distant about five miles. Union, Hailsham. Popu- lation in 1811, 505 ; in 1861, 587. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at ,\u00a3451 ; Patrons, Dean and Chapter of Canterbury; Incumbent, Bev. George Bainier, B.A., of Brasenose College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1663. Acreage, 2,554. This parish is seated on an eminence, and commands an interesting view, including Battle Abbey, part of Hastings, Ashburnham, Crowhurst Park, part of the range of the South Downs, and, in the distance, Pevensey bay and Eastbourne. The highest elevation in the parish is Standard Hid, on which stands an old house with gables, and an inscription in raised letters on the front, as follows : \u2014 \" God's providence is my inheritance. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Here we have (1659)noabidence.\" \" The origin of this inscription is supposed to be, that a former pro prietor was displeased with his heir, and determined to disinherit him,"], [382, "62 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. but the heir unexpectedly recovering possession of his inheritance, inscribed these words on his dwelling for a memorial.\" (Hastings Past and Present.) In a subsidy roll of 1327 for the parish occurs the name of Stephen atte Standard. The Domesday account of this place is by no means clear, and it is impossible to ascertain whether it or the adjacent vid of Netherfield is intended. The manor belonged to the Earls of Eu, during the ascendancy of that family in the Rape ; but after their forfeiture it passed to the family of Hastings. In 1295 the families of Cherche and Brun appear as the principal land owners. The church (St. Mary) comprises chancel and nave, and a large wooden bell-turret over the west end of the latter. It contains only one bell, dedicated to St. Martin, with an Old English inscription. The architecture is partly Early English and partly Decorated. There is little of interest in the church. There are memorials to the names of Luxford of Moorhall, in this parish, Dunk, Bowyer, Clark, and Fuller. At the south east corner of the church-yard is a grand old yew tree. The parish register contains the following rather curious entry : \"Anno Domini, 1669, June 23, was buried Joseph Tysehurst, a boy (son of the late William Tysehurst) who on Witsunday morning fell from climbing a magpy's nest, and was smothered in a pond of mud, his heels sticking upright.\" More-hall was for several generations the estate of a branch of the ancient family of Wenham of Wenham Hall, in Suffolk, who continued to hold it down to the latter half of the seven teenth century.

Without detracting from the merits of the other four, we may certainly accord high praise to this, for its truly rural and delightful aspect, with its pleasing admixture of arable, pasture, meadows, woods, and hop-gardens. In Domesday the manor is called simply Hiham, the prefix North having probably been applied in order to dis tinguish it from the neighbouring places called Higham, in Salehurst, and Petit Higham, the site of New Winchelsea. The manor belonged, in Saxon times, to Earl Godwin, and after wards to the Earl of Eu in person. It contained two hides, and was valued at \u00a36. \" It had been devastated\" \u2014 probably by an overflow of the Rother, which is its northern boundary. In 24th Edward III. William Fiennes was lord, and in 9th Edward IV. Eichard F., Lord Dacre, held it with Ewhurst, late the posses sions of John Brenchley and Thomas Ashburnham, and before of Henry Sharnden and Richard Codyng, by the service of 1^ knight's fee. The next recorded holder of the manor is Nicholas Tufton, who died in 1539, and by his will directed his body to be buried in the church of Northiam, before the altar of St. Nicholas, with a tombstone, and his picture, and a writing thereon. The direction was obeyed, but the brass has been torn off in modern times, though it is engraved in Grose, vol. i. His son, John Tufton, succeeded him in the manor. The manor of Tufton, or Toketon, gave name to the important family of De Toketon, who resided in Northiam for several centuries, and became ancestors ofthe Tuftons, Earls of Thanet. Their abode, called Tufton Place, is now represented by a farm-house. Among the Brickwad evidences is a deed executed at Northiam in 1362, to which Simon de Toketon was a witness. About the end of the last century the then Lord Thanet sold it to the late Edward Jeremiah Curteis, Esq., whose grandson, Herbert Mascall Curteis, Esq., sold it, a few years since, to Lord Harry Vane, now Duke of Cleveland. The family of Tufton ceased to be resident here from the sixteenth century, when they removed to Hothfield, in Kent. Dixter, another manor, which has long been in the Springett family, gave name to the De Dixternes at an early date. Adam and William De Dixterne are mentioned in a deed of 1296, and John Dykesterne was vicar of Rye in"], [384, "64 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. 1306.* The manor seems to have passed to the widely-spread Sussex family of Tregoz, for in 1330 the King granted to Thomas Tregoz license to fortify his manse here with a wall of stone and lime, and to cren elate the same. To this family it would appear that that of Elrington succeeded, as in 1479 John Elryngton, Knight, obtained a similar license for Dixtherne and Udey mere. This Sir John Elryngton was Keeper of the Wardrobe to Edward IV., Treasurer of the Household to Edward V., and Constable of Windsor Castle. He married Margaret, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Echingham. Some remains of the ancient manor-house exist. It was a timber-framed edifice; one half only is now standing. The architectural details are strictly medieval, and the hall contains some rudely carved ar morials on the trusses which support the roof, but they have not been critically examined. An antique house hard by bears the date of 1583, and another at Hole farm has some curious detads. Wed-house, on the Frewen estate, is another timbered building of considerable antiquity, with a had open to the roof. A picturesque farm-house, caded Carriers, on the Brickwad estate, is also ancient, and is, according to tradition, the birth place of Archbishop Frewen (See post). On the village-green, near the church-yard, is a hollow tree, 24 feet in circumference, called Queen Elizabeth's Oak, from the circumstance that on August 11, 1573, the maiden queen, en route from Mr. Guldeford's, at Hempstead, to the town of Rye, dined under this tree, the viands being furnished by Mr. George Bishopp, who dwelt opposite the oak in the antique timbered house slid existing, which was the abode of his family for many generations. During the repast her Majesty changed her shoes, and the pair she took off, having been begged from her attendants, are stid preserved at Brickwall. The tradition of the Queen's having dined at Northiam is fully confirmed by the book of the Comptroder of Her Majesty's household of the date, which also states that she again dined at Northiam on her return journey on the 14th August following. Brickwad House ranks amongst the most interesting mansions of East Sussex. It was originally the residence of the Whites, a family long connected with Rye and Winchelsea. John White purchased the estate in 1492. Towards the end of Elizabeth, William White succeeded, and married Mary, sister of Sir Thomas Sackville, K.B., of Sedlescombe. He put a new three gabled front to the mansion. At his death the property was sold for the benefit of three daughters and co-heiresses. The purchaser (in 1666) was Stephen Frewen, Alderman of London. The family of Dexter still exists in East Sussex."], [385, "65 NORTHIAM. The family of Frewen, doubtless of Saxon origin, were long established in Worcestershire. Richard Frewen, of Earl's Croome in that county, purchased the advowson of Northiam, and presented his son John to the living in 1583. John Frewen was a learned and pious Puritan divine of high standing, and author of several theological works. He continued Rector here tfll his death in 1628. He was father of Accepted Frewen, the wed-known Archbishop of York ; Thankful, Secretary to Lord- Keeper Coventry ; and Stephen, Alderman of London, who died at Brickwad in 1679. His estates passed to his son, Thomas Frewen, M.P. for Rye, from 1679 to 1699. Brickwad descended, after the death of his widow, to Sir Edward Frewen, his son by his first wife. About 1685, having traveded on the Continent, he returned hither, and budt the banqueting-room at Brickwad in the Louis-Quatorze style, and employed French artists to execute the ceilings of this, and the grand staircase, at an outlay of \u00a3800. The hall was intended for the entertainment of the Corporation of Rye, of which borough the famdy held the patronage. After Sir Edward's grandson's death, the mansion was neglected by the famdy, who preferred living at their seats in Yorkshire or Leicestershire ; but the present owner, who came to reside in 1830, restored it to nearly its former state. There is a valuable collection of pictures, including works by C. Jansen, Holbein, Lely, &c. Among the Frewen portraits are John Frewen, the Puritan, by Mark Gerard, 1627, very quaint and characteristic, Archbishop Frewen, Alderman Frewen, Accepted Frewen, Archbishop of York, and numerous others by eminent painters. The gardens are preserved in the old Dutch taste. A fine avenue of oaks, said to have been planted from acorns from the Queen's Oak, is now represented by a single fine tree. The north front is a good specimen of the timbered house, but the other three sides were cased with brick by Sir Edward Frewen. The church (of which Hussey gives a view) forms a striking pile. The old portions consist of nave with aisles, and square battlemented tower, more than half of which is Norman, with small stone spire, unique in this district. There are traces of Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular in the budding. The old chancel, which contained three sedilia and a piscina, was removed to make way for a larger one in 1837, 8, and an addition was also made on the north side. In 1846, Thomas Frewen, Esq., erected a handsome Mausoleum * over the vaults containing the remains of his ancestors. It is in the Tudor style, from designs by Smirke. On each wad are nine shields, * By a special \" faculty\" this Mausoleum is exempt from all ecclesiastical jurisdiction, VOL. II. F"], [386, "66 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. with impalements and quarterings, shewing the Frewen alli ances. The armorial window and the roof decorations are by Willement, and the carvings both in wood and stone were wrought by a self-taught artist of Rye. The Frewen monu ments, formerly^ in the chancel, were removed into this mauso leum, and soon after its erection a beautiful memorial, with a bust by Behnes, was erected for Anne, wife of Thomas Frewen, Esq., who died in 1844. The other memorials in the church are principally to the memory of members of the Frewen famdy, four of whom were rectors here. The only brass now remaining (see that of Nicholas Tufton, ante) is a priest in canonicals, Mobr.t $3ruft>Vtl, \" sumtyme person of this churche,\" 1518. In the church-yard there is a yew-tree, probably older than any part of the church. The \" Church house,\" near the building, is supposed to be of the date of Henry VIII., and is in the form of the letter H.

This parish, which lies to the west of St. Leonard's Forest, is picturesque and well-wooded. Mr. Nelthorpe's residence, Nuthurst Lodge, commands a very extensive view over the Weald, reaching to the South Downs ; and the sea is occasionally visible. Highurst, containing about 100 acres, is part of this parish, though it is insulated within the neighbouring parish of Cowfold. The manors of Shortsfield and Nutham extend over the greater part of the parish. The patronage of the church formerly belonged to the abbey of Fecamp in Normandy. About tbe year 1230, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Chiehester and the monastery of Fecamp, respecting the jurisdiction of the former over the canons and clerks of Steyning, and an award was made that Steyning should be free from the ordinary jurisdiction of the Bishop ; but in order that the church of Chiehester might not suffer detriment, all rights of advowson, &c, which had belonged to Fecamp abbey in Notehurst, Bury, and Slynfold, should be handed over to the bishop and his successors. f 2"], [388, "68 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The church (St. Andrew), consists of tower, nave, and chan cel, the last of which has in its windows some remains of ancient painted glass.

The living is a Perpetual curacy, value \u00a3125, in the gift of the Rector of Maresfield. Incumbent the Rev. William Albert Smallpiece, M.A. The name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon hnut, a nut, and leag, indicating a part of the forest of Ashdown comparatively open, but abounding with hazel. When the forest possessed a hunting-seat, under the earlier Ed wards and John of Gaunt, Nutley appears to have been a small vill, then called Notley or Notlye. It possessed a chapel known as the free chapel of Maresfield or Notley. The great Reformer Wycliffe is said to have performed divine offices here, when under the patronage of John of Gaunt. Before 1541 the chapel was disused. The site was about half a mile west of the present village, near a wood stdl called chapel wood. The font was res cued, by the Rev. E. Turner, from a cow-yard, and is in his possession. [S. A. C. For references, see under Maresfield.]"], [389, "69 OFFHAM. ORE. OFFHAM. A considerable hamlet of Hamsey, about two miles from Lewes, on the ancient Ermin Street and the old London road. A great portion of the population of the parish reside here ; and by the beneficence of the late Sir Henry Shiffner, Bart, of Coombe, and other members of his family, a church (St. Peter) was erected, to replace the old ediflce, which is rather remote and inconvenient of access. It is built in a style somewhat French, and consists of a nave, tower, with shingled spire, eastward, and an apsidal chancei beyond. It is beautifully situated on a rising ground, and forms from every point of view an elegant adjunct to the landscape. This hamlet is popularly supposed to derive its name from its being an \"off,\" or outlying place; but the old orthographies, Wougham, Woffam, Okeham, &c, do not support that etymology. Offham chalk-pits afford a good study for the geologist ; and it is worth recording that the first radway con structed in Sussex connects these pits with a branch of the river Ouse for the conveyance of chalk and lime. It is a very steep incline, and was planned about the beginning of this cen tury by Mr. Cater Rand, a schoolmaster of Lewes. OFFHAM. A hamlet of South Stoke near Arundel. ORE. A parish in the Hundred of Baldslow ; Bape of Hastings ; distant nearly two miles north from Hastings, its Post-town and Bailway station. Union, Hastings. Population in 1811, 331 ; in 1861, 1,636.

This parish, which may now be. considered a fashionable suburb of Hastings, is remarkable for its bold undulations, steep roads, commanding scenery \u2014 overlooking the town and the Eng lish Channel \u2014 and a charming mixture of woodland and pasture. In the reign of Henry III., the manor was possessed by a family of the same name, and at a later period Richard Halle, or Hawley, originally of Halland, in East Hothly, married the heiress, Anne, daughter of John Ore. Their descendants possessed it"], [390, "70 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. for about six generations, when it passed to the family of Crispe. From 1686 to 1768 it belonged to the Carylls ; afterwards, suc cessively, to General Murray, the hero of Quebec, to W. Lucas Shadwed (1821), and to Sir Howard Elphinstone, Bart. The mansion of Ore Place is modem. There seems no reasonable ground for the tradition that it stands on the site of a house built by John of Gaunt, which afterwards became a monastic establishment. Indeed the continuous occupation, by the Ores and Hawleys, from the 13th to the 17th century, almost pre cludes the possibility of such erection and subsequent use. Coghurst Hall is a commodious mansion in a fine well-wooded park, the seat of Charles Hay Frewen, Esq., M.P. It belonged, in 1712, to the family of Fletcher, whose heiress conveyed it in marriage to the Dynes of Westfield. Mary Fletcher Dyne, their heiress, married in the 18th century Musgrave Brisco, Esq., of Wakefield and Ripon, and so carried this, and other good lands, to that family. The Hastings union-house and public cemetery are both in this parish. The church (St. Helen) is an unpretending edifice of nave, chancel, south aisle, added in 1821, and low square tower. In the nave are, or lately were, several gravestones, including a iltass for a man and his wife (arms and inscription removed), the indent of another brass (probably of the Ore or Hawley family), and two inscriptions for the Crispe family, with their arms. There are also monuments for General Murray (1794) and his relatives, and for members of the Whitears, Cowells, Norths, and others. For the use of the parishioners living on the borders of Fairlight, a handsome church, caded Christ Church, was erected in 1859. [S. A. C. Eelfe of, xiv, 85. Crispe of, xvi, 47. Bell, xvi, 219.

This ancient monastic establishment was founded in the parish of Hailsham for monks of the Premonstratensian order, by Ralph de Dene, a member of a Norman family resident at West Dean orientalis, in the latter half of the 12th century. From the charter of foundation, it appears that a chapel had previously existed here, and had been served by certain monks of the order. The abbey of Otteham or Hotteham was dedi cated to St. Laurence, and was endowed with lands and tene ments in Sussex. Among the subsequent benefactors to the house were the families of De Aquila, De Brode (of the ' Broad '"], [391, "71 OVING in Hellingly), De Herst, De la Water, De St. Leger, &c. The place chosen for the monastery was an unfortunate one \u2014 the soil was damp and unproductive ; wherefore the brethren (\"propter magnas et intolerabiles inedias loci de Otteham\") be sought Ela de Sackville, the founder's daughter, to translate them to a more salubrious spot, which was done, and Bayham was the place fixed on. (See Bayham.) Previously one of the De Brodes had invited the monks to settle at his church of Hel lingly, of which Hailsham was then a chapel. From the time of the transfer to Bayham, Otteham remained as a grange, with its chapel and a ministering brother or two, with a lamp burn ing night and day before St. Laurence's altar. Mention is made of an image of that saint in gold, silver, and wax, and tithes were payable from many lands for the sustentation of the chapel. A paper by the Rev. G. Miles Cooper, in Vol. v. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" gives many interesting particulars of the benefactors to the establishment, and the presumed sites of its possessions. Very little remains to attest the existence of Otteham Abbey, except the ancient and much dilapidated chapel, wliich has features of the 13th century, and still possesses a battered sedile and piscina. It is adjacent to Otham farm-house, and used as a stable. What a falling off from St. Laurence in silver, gold, and wax, to a home for cart-horses ! This district of Hailsham is called Otham Quarter.

Shopwyke, though not strictly a tything or hamlet, is a very interesting place. The manor is presumed to have been a part of the manor of Aldingbourne, which belonged to the see of Selsey, and a prebend was here formed for Chiehester Cathedral. The manor-house and the corpus of the prebend belong to the Precentor of Chiehester.

After the Dissolution, Drayton came into the possession of the Chatfields of Ditchhng and Treyford. The Chatfields were succeeded by the Elsons before mentioned. The church appears to have been originally Early English, but there are insertions of a much later date, and transepts have been added. There are inscriptions to the names of Woodyer, Elson, Walter, Teness, and Green.* The Rev.

C. Mabbott, Esq., of Southover. The manor bouse, now much modernized, was occupied in 1651 by Mr. Maunsell, and an unfounded tradi tion asserts that Charles II. , after his flight from the battle of Worcester, took shelter here while awaiting the means of escape to France. This presumed incident is the conspicuous feature of Mr. Harrison Ainsworth's pleasant novel called \" Ovingdean Grange.\" The Rev. Mr. Morgan, in a letter ad dressed to Sir Widiam Burrell, in 1 780, describes the village as consisting of one farm-house, three cottages, and a mean, thatched parsonage-house. He adds, that \" when the Geeres lived at Ovingdean farm, Charles II. lay concealed here till he had an opportunity of embarking at Brighton for France. His appearance had such an effect upon the good woman of the house that her next chdd (a very fine boy) was said to be the picture ofthe King!\" (Burrell MS., 5684.) How this myth of the\" mut ton-eating king\" having visited Ovingdean arose, it is impossible to say, for he certainly came no nearer the village than Brigbton, nearly three mdes distant. There would appear, however, to be some slight association of the Geere family with the King's escape, as their descendants possessed, a few years since, some rehcs, which were always understood to have been presented by the King. Ovingdean House was formerly the seat of the Kemp family. The church has chancel, nave, and west tower, with features of the Norman, Early English, and Decorated styles. (Hussey.) Some more recent authorities consider a few of the features un- questionably of Saxon date. Mr. Gordon M. Hdls speaks of it as an \" almost perfect Saxon church.\" (Journal of the British Arch\u00e6ological Association, 1867, p. 8.)

Its village proper is close to the little inlet of the Channel called Paghain Harbour, an estuary said to have been formed by a sudden irruption of the sea about the beginning of the fourteenth century, which, according to the Non\u00e6 Roll, de- vastated 2,700 acres of land. Only smad craft can enter this little port. Pagham Creek is a famous resort for wild fowl, several of great rarity, and in severe winters, as Mr. A. E. Knox informs us, flocks of wdd swans are always to be seen and heard here. The manor was granted by Ceadwalla, King of the South Saxons, to St. Wilfred, and continued, with the advowson, in episcopal possession through many centuries. It was a very important estate, and was held, both before and after the Con- quest, by the Archbishops of Canterbury, who made it their occasional residence, and constituted it a Deanery, including all the \" Peculiars\" in West Sussex. In the reign of the Confessor the manor was rated at 50 hides, and afterwards at 34. A curious custom existed as to pig breeding. For herbage every seventh pig was payable to the lord, and the Record adds \" that this custom was established throughout the whole county of Sussex,\" but I have not found an instance of it anywhere else. A mid, perhaps on the site of what is now the large tide-mill at Sidlesham, is mentioned, as also a church, together with another church at Chiehester, wliich must be that of All Saints in the Padant in that city, still in the gift of the Archbishop. The parish is subdivided into five tythings \u2014 Nytimber-with-Pagham, Crimsham, South Mundham, Aldwicke, and Seven-households. Aldwicke was a valuable possession, and gave name to the sur- rounding hundred. In this hamlet a miniature watering-place has sprung up. It contains several excellent residences, parti- cularly Aldwick House, the property of B. Bond Cabbed, Esq., F.S.A. A smad chapel-of-ease was built here a few years since by the Rev. Edward Houghton Johnson, M.A. The parish church (said to be St. Thomas a Becket) is good Early English, though much injured by modern repairs. It was probably budt by an archbishop soon after Thomas's canoniza- tion. It had an altar of St. Nycolas, and three brotherhoods of St. Andrew, St. Matthew, and the Holyrood. It consists of chancel, nave, with aisles, a transept, and tower, with a low, shingled spire. There are five bells. At the east end of the north aisle was a chantry, founded in 1383 by John Bo wr ere (the modern Borrer) and Alice, his wife. Richard Hede, the last incumbent, received a pension of \u00a35. In Pope Nicholas' taxa tion, 1291, the church of Pagham \" cum capella\" is mentioned. This chapel was dedicated to St. Andrew, and some remains of it are mentioned by Dallaway as existing in his time. On a slab in the chancel ofthe church there are remains of a Lombardic"], [395, "75 PAEHAM. inscription for jjgmoit. . . . \" Templi Rector suit hujus.\" The relics of the body of this ancient priest, in his canonicals, in a stone coffin, were brought to light some years ago on the removal of the slab. There are other memorials for the names of Barfoote, Darling, Pechell (ofthe baronet's family), Peachey, and Godman, and one for Edmunde Darell, Esquior, \" Clerke of the Caterie\" to Queen Elizabeth, 1579. The Darells were a branch of the Calehill and Scotney family, and were of Bowley, or Boley, in this parish. Remains of the archiepiscopal palace are visible to the south-east of the church. Dixon gives many interesting particulars as to the geology of this and the adjacent parishes. Messrs. Dixon, C.

James Beck, M.A., of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1538. Acreage, 1,264. This is a small parish in form approaching to a square, and consists of arable, pasture, wood, and down, in nearly equal portions. The soils vary from sand to chalk and marl. There is no proper vidage, and the only house of importance is the noble mansion of Lord de la Zouch, shortly to be described. The manor of Perham was held before the Conquest by Tovi, a free man, and afterwards of Earl Roger de Montgomeri by Robert I., was rated at three hides, and had two villeins, a cottar, and a mill. The value was \u00a33 per annum. Early in the reign of Edward III. it had passed to the influential family of Tregoz, who had inherited from that of St. John. In 1399 Edward Tregoz was lord. It afterwards appears to have vested in the Crown. In 1 550 Robert Palmer, third son of Thomas Palmer, of Angmering, was seised of it, and his son Sir Thomas Palmer"], [396, "76 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. completed the present manor-house, and enclosed a park. Sir Thomas Palmer, his grandson, sold the estate to Sir Thomas Bisshopp, of Henfield, in 1597, who was created a baronet in 1620. Sir Cecil Bisshopp, the eighth who held that title, was summoned to Parliament by writ in 1815, as Baron Zouche of Haryngworth, which title had been in abeyance since 1625. This ancient barony by writ dates from 2nd Edward II. , 1308. Parham came by the marriage of Harriet- Anne, daughter of Sir Cecil Bisshopp, to the Honourable Robert Curzon, third son of Ashton Viscount Curzon. Their son, the present Lord de la Zouche, on the death of his mother in 1870, succeeded to the title and estates. The Abbey of St. Peter of Westminster held lands in Parham from the time of the Confessor, which were rated in his time at seven hides, though in Domesday at only three. There were eight villeins and five cottars. These lands, with the advowson of the church, appear to have vested in the Abbey tid the dis solution. They now form a principal portion of the manorial estate. Parham House was built early in the 1 6th century, on a very grand scale, but has received subsequent additions. Like many other mansions of the same character in the county, it lies at the foot of the South Downs in a fine park full of picturesque beauty, abounding with venerable oaks, and well stocked with fallow deer, together with a famous heronry. There are several noble apartments, particularly the hall, 51 feet by 26, and 24 in height, and the picture gallery, 158 feet long, which contains numerous fine portraits of the builder of Parham House, of the Bisshopp famdy and their connections, of Queen Elizabeth, and of various officers of state and other noble and gentle person ages. The dining and drawing-rooms, with other apartments, also possess many excedent paintings. Parham is one grand museum of ancient and modern art and literary rarities. Many of the objects have been collected by the antiquarian skdl and industry of the present noble possessor, the author of \" Monas teries of the Levant,\" and other works. The hbrary contains about 100 writings on tablets of stone and wood ; Egyptian papyri, a large number of ancient MSS., chiefly on vellum, some being of the fourth century, and several in the Greek, Coptic, and Syriac languages, written before the year 1000, some beauti fudy iduminated ; early printed books, including several Caxtons and Wynkyn de Wordes, first printed editions of Homer and Virgil, early Bibles, the five folio editions of Shakspeare, a copy of the \" World of Wonders,\" containing an autograph of the great bard himself. Then there is a superb collection of ancient gold and silver plate, enamels, and ivory carvings, most beautiful"], [397, "77 PATCHAM. to behold, and most precious to possess. A considerable number of these objects are ecclesiastical. In the hall are the arms of Queen Elizabeth, over the spot on which that dlustrious lady is said te have dined in 1592. This apartment is graced with \"armoires,\" containing an important codection of armour of all countries and ages, of which the greater part, belonging to the 15th century, was collected by the noble and accomplished owner of Parham (\"fortunate puer \") from the deserted church of St. Irene at Constantinople. What adds to their interest is the fact that these steel vestments once clad the gadant defenders of the last of the imperial Paleologi against the Turks on the fad of the Eastern Empire before Mahomet II. in 1452. Lord de la Zouche drew up the particulars of his priceless purchase, and his account of these articles and the other objects in the hall, lies on the great table for the inspection of the privileged visitor. Wed did a living worthy remark of the grand codection in this mansion : \u2014 \" In any house who can compare 'em, Those precious things that lie at Par-ham 1\" The church (St. Peter ?) is a smad building of nave and south aisle, probably of early date, but much modernized, with the addition of a tower in 1800, at the expense of the Bisshopp family.

The tenantry consisted of 143 villeins and 45 bondmen, having 82 ploughs. Connected with the church there were 16 dependents, and there was pan- nage for 100 hogs. Twenty six houses in Lewes also appertained to the manor. It afterwards formed part of the barony of Lewes. At present the Earl of Abergavenny is lord, and Lady Ogle, daughter and heiress of the late Thomas William Roe, Esq., possesses the manors of Withdean Court ancl Withdean Cayliffe. Withdean Court, recently partly rebuilt by Lady Ogle, is traditionally one of the residences of Anne of Cleves, who had a grant of the manor in 1541. Withdean, a considerable hamlet, was written in the 16th century Wyghtdeane, and is commonly pronounced Whiting. Moulscombe belonged, from the 15th to the 19th century and, traditionally, from the time of the Conquest, to the family of Webb. Patcham Place was one of the seats of the Lords La Warr. A branch of the great family of Shelley afterwards possessed it for several generations, until their removal to Southover and Lewes. Subsequently the baronet family of Stapley had it for two or three descents, and Sir John Stapley sold it, with the impropriation, to John Lilly, gentleman, whose nephew aliened it in 1719, to George, Lord Abergavenny. In 1764, a good estate here was purchased by John Paine, Esq., ancestor of the present owner. The house, which is partly of the date of Queen Elizabeth, is situated on the Downs, with beautiful adjuncts of wood and lawn. In my \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 285, I have adduced my reasons for believing that John Peckham, Archbishop of Canter- bury, ob. 1294, was a native of this parish. A family of De Pecham resided here, temp. Edward I. Another family of great antiquity in Sussex, the Farncombes, derived their name from the lands called Varncombe in this parish, in or before the reign of Edward III. The church (All Saints) ' consists of chancel, nave, and west tower, with battlements. Hussey describes it as containing features of Transition-Norman, Decorated, and Perpendicular architecture. Besides more recent monuments, the church and church-yard have memorials for Shelley, 1594; Stapley (17th century), Paine, Farncombe, Roe, and Jones. Hodingbury hill or \" castle \" is a castrametation in the south east quarter of this parish. Armill\u00e6, celts, and other British remains have been found near this spot.

In 948 Patching was given, by Wlfric, to Christ Church, Canterbury, and in Domesday it is included in the territory of the Archbishop. According to that record, it was appropriated to the monks for their clothing. Godfrey de Mealing was ten ant in 1155. From temp. Edward I., to 1446, or later, it was held by the knightly family of Le Waleys. From 33rd Henry VIII. it was held by the Shelleys with Michelgrove, until 1800, when it was bought by Richard Walker, Esq., whose son, R. W. Walker, sold it in 1828 to Bernard-Edward, Duke of Norfolk. A church is mentioned in Domesday. It was dependent on the mother-church of Tarring until 1282, when it was made a separate Rectory. The existing building \" is of larger dimen sions than the generality of parish churches in this neighbour hood, and the plan is rather uncommon. The nave had origin ally an aisle on the north side, at the east end of which aisle the tower, which about 1790 had a shingled spire, was placed; the chancel had also an aisle or chapel attached to the north side, which has been taken down. The west end of the nave has been reduced in length.\" (Cartwright, 1830.) The building was renovated about 1856 by Sir John Kirkland, then resident here. Mr. Hussey considers the tower Transition-Norman. There are memorials for Delany, Jordan, Symmons, Bushby, &c. The villagers have a tradition that \" some Archbishop\" was buried at Patching.

(\" Battle Abbey Deeds,\" p. 124.) In 3rd Edward II. Stephen Burghersh had free warren, and in 7th Henry IV. Elizabeth, wife of Nicho las Vurrefl, held the manor. In 3rd and 4th Phdip and Mary Anthony, Viscount Montague, sold to Robert Sheppard the glebe of the parsonage or prebend of Pesemershe, and his descendants were connected with the parish for several generations. In 1719 the manor continued in the heirs of Edward Sheppard, Esq. In 1743 the Mascalls were in possession, and so continued until 1821, when Caroline, co-heiress of Robert Mascall, Esq., con veyed it by marriage to Herbert Barrett Curteis, Esq., father of the present proprietor. The church (St. Peter and St. Paul), which has lately been restored, is principally in the Early English style, though the chancel arch is Norman. It consists of chancel, nave, with aisles, and tower with spire. \" In the south wall are four small arches, one of which is a piscina.\" There are tablets and inscrip tions for the names of Mascall, Delves, Shephard, Parr, Smith, Holt, Webber, Lettice, &c.

He entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, but recklessly left the University and com menced the career of a literary adventurer in London, where, after a course of vice and misery, he died at the early age of 21.

Ceadwalla, King of the South Saxons, who died in 688, granted to the Archbishop of Canterbury various manors, ex tending from Lewes into the Primate's own diocese, so that he could travel from the archiepiscopal see to the county town of Sussex without quitting his own territory. These manors are circumstantially mentioned in Domesday. The Bishops of Chi ehester had no jurisdiction in the churches of these manors, and as \" Peculiars\" of the see of Canterbury, and in tbe gift of the successive Archbishops, the latter have, until within late years, held their periodical Visitations. Recent legislation, however, has thrown the benefices into the diocese of Chiehester, though the Archbishop still holds tbe patronage. These remarks apply principally to the East Sussex Peculiars, but there are others in the Archdeaconry of Chiehester which have been placed under the same ecclesiastical regulations. The Peculiars are as follows : \u2014 East Sussex (locady within the Archdeaconry of Lewes and Deanery of South Mading) \u2014 Mayfield, Buxted, with Uckfield annexed, Isfield, Edburton, Stanmer, Framfield, Glynde, St. Thomas-at-Cliffe, Ringmer, and Wadhurst.

In several of these places the Archbishops had mansiones, or resting-places, specially Mayfield Palace, Tarble Down in Fram field, Broyle in Ringmer, South Mailing, West Tarring, Pag ham, and Slyndon.

The manor has long been added to the Ashburnham estate. The church is smad, consisting of a nave, chancel, and low square tower, in the \" later style of English architecture.\" (Horsfield.) There are some remains of antiquity which were more perfect when the church was visited by Sir William Bur rell. He mentions, among the painted glass in the east window, figures, architectural designs, the arms of Pelham, and those of Penhurst. (Sa. a mullet of 6 points, arg.) Some traces of the rood-loft also existed, and upon the beam \" Ecce Homo\" between the sentences (right) \" Venite benedicti in regnum Patris mei,\" and (left) \"Ite maledicti in ignem eternum.\" The four windows of the nave had also quarries of painted glass. An iron slab in the chancel commemorates Peter Gower, 1703. Towards the end of the last century the Rev. Joseph Wise, an author of some repute, held this benefice. [S. A. C. Iron-works, ii, 215.

The manor of Pett, which lies chiefly in this parish and Guestling, is said to be identical with the devastated manor of Luet, mentioned in Domesday, but I think Fairlight has a better claim to that designation. It belonged in 1368 to Henry Halle, of Ore, from whose family it appears to have passed to the Levetts. In 1574 John Fletcher died seised of the manor and advowson. In the 18th century it belonged to the Medleys, and passed as Buxted to the late Earl of Liverpool. Part of the parish is flat, and known as Pett Level, but other portions are undulating and agreeable. From one point the coast of France is discernible in clear weather. The vdlage is pleasantly situated nearly midway between Winchelsea and Hastings. Itsseabord is defended (?) by eight Martedo towers. The church (St. Mary and St. Peter) was rebuilt in 1864, and contains monuments for the Wynch family ; also one by West macott to Cordelia Sayer, 1 820, and a brass plate to George Theobald, 1641, \" He gave a bell freely to grace the new steeple"], [403, "83 PETWORTH. \u2014 Ring out his prayse therefore, ye good people.\" The mditary canal extends from Cliff-end in this parish to Hythe, a distance of 23 miles.

Besides the notices of it in Dallaway, Horsfield, &c, it has had its historians in Dr. Roger Turner, (S. A. C.) xiv, and, more recently, in a monograph by the Rev. F. H. Arnold, 1 864. Mr. Arnold remarks that \" while Petworth is characterized by the beauty of its scenery, the magnificence of its park, the number of its charitable institutions, and more recently by the treasures of art collected in Petworth House, the history ofthe place itself possesses, at least, as much interest as usually attaches to other towns, with which it may be fitly compared.\" It has been connected for many centuries, in an undisturbed line of succession, with one of the greatest of our historical races, and \" Percy-honoured \" is an epithet which it may properly claim and bear. The etymology of Petworth seems to be \" the worth or estate of Peta,\" though the compilers of Domesday thought proper to spell it Peteorde. No more than modern Frenchmen, could they get over our Saxon theta. See the analogous instance of Ordinges for Worthing. Petworth was held as a free manor of Edward the Confessor by a Saxon lady called Eddeva. Roger, Earl of Chiehester and Arundel, granted it to his Norman friend and vassal, Robert de Belesme, whose son, \" Robert the Cruel,\" suc ceeded. On his forfeiture Henry I. bequeathed it to his second g 2"], [404, "84 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. wife Adeliza, who re-married William de Albini, Earl of Arundel ; but Petworth was conveyed by gift from the queen to her brother Joceline de Louvaine (1140) as an infeudation of Arundel, by the service of being Castellan there. Josceline took the name of Percy on his marriage with Agnes, daughter of William de Percy, 3rd in descent from a companion of the Conqueror. He was succeeded by his son Henry, whose brother Richard was one of the Magna-Charta barons. The next conspicuous personages of this great line were, Henry the 4th lord, who was taken prisoner by the Barons at the battle of Lewes in 1264, and his successor Henry, who was at Dunbar and Bannockburn. Henry son of the latter, and his son Henry, the seventh lord, figure largely in war and public affairs in the 14th century. Henry, the 8th lord of Petworth was created Earl of Northumberland by Richard II. , and from that date, as Mr. Arnold remarks, a series of catas trophes ensue. The duke, who was also Earl-Marshal, took the side of Wickliffe against Courtenay, Bishop of London, in 1337, and had a narrow escape of his life. His son was the widely renowned Hotspur, whose history is so well known as the oppon ent of Henry iV., and for his subsequent turbulent career. His history belongs to England rather than to Alnwick and Petworth. His sword is among the treasures of Petworth House. Hotspur's son, the 2nd Earl, is supposed to be one of the heroes of Chevy Chase, though he could not have fallen there at the hand of the Scotch knight, since that fate was reserved for him at the battle of St. Albans. Henry, the 3rd Earl, was born at Leconfield, co. York, another of the great Percy estates, in 1421. Like his father he adhered to the Lancastrian cause, and commanded and fell at the sanguinary battle of Towton. Henry, 4th Earl, was assassinated at his house at Cocksedge, near Thirsk. Henry, 5th Earl, was a conspicuous personage in the court of Henry VIII., and was present at the Battle of the Spurs. From the celebrated \" Northumberland Household Book \" it appears that his ordinary establishment consisted of 223 persons. Henry Algernon, the 6th Earl, was in the retinue of Wolsey, and a lover of Anna Boleyn, and it is a lucky circumstance that he did not lose his head as well as his heart. He afterwards married the Lady Mary Talbot, but left no issue. His brother Thomas was beheaded for treason in Aske's rebellion, but he left a son of his own name who succeeded his uncle as the 7th Earl of Northumberland, he having previously been created by Queen Mary, in 1557, Baron Percy, of Cockermouth and Petworth. He was a zealous Roman ist, and taking up arms against Elizabeth, fled to Scotland, where he was beheaded at the command of the Earl of Morton. His brother Henry, 8th Earl, became a Protestant, and long enjoyed the favour of Elizabeth, but at length, on suspicion of"], [405, "TETWORTH. 85 complicity with Thockmorton and Paget for the liberation of the Queen of Scots, he was committed to the Tower, where he committed suicide with a \"dag \" or pistol in 1585. Henry, 9th Earl, laboured under the unjust suspicion of having been con cerned in the Gunpowder Plot (in which his relative Thomas Percy took part) and was imprisoned in the Tower for more than 15 years, where he solaced himself in the pursuits of science. He paid a fine of \u00a320,000 and was discharged on his parole that he would not go more than 30 miles from Petworth House. He was a great patron of science. An admirable portrait of him by Vandyke is preserved at Petworth. His son Algernon, 10th Earl, and K.G., was Lord High-Admiral of England. He sided with the Parliament at first, but was averse to the execution of Charles I. The care of the monarch's children was entrusted to him, and he treated them with the utmost kindness. During the Commonwealth he lived in retirement at Petworth, delight ing hi rural occupations. He assisted Monk in the restora tion of Charles II. , and became a Privy Councillor. His first wife was the Lady Anne Cecil, and as a memorial ofthe marriage an oak tree was planted in Petworth Park, which still maintains a vigorous existence. By his second wife, the Lady Elizabeth Howard, he was father of Josceline, the eleventh and last Earl of Northumberland, who died in 1670, leaving a daughter Eliza beth, Baroness Percy, in whom vested the ancestral honours and the vast estates of the Percys. She had many suitors, and was \"three times a wife before she was 16.\" Her 3rd husband was Charles Seymour, the \" proud,\" and 6th Duke of Somerset, by whom she had 13 chddren, but only three daughters and one son survived. He lived in almost regal state, and exacted the utmost servility from his children and dependents, but although he declined to take the name of Percy as he had covenanted to do, he always treated his duchess with the greatest devotion ancl respect. He possessed many noble qualities, and was a firm adherent to the reformed religion. He gave his services to the Prince of Orange, and on the death of Queen Anne was active in promoting the interests of George I. He died in 1748, when his only son, Algernon, succeeded him as the 7th Duke of Somerset, and owner of Petworth, having previously been created Earl of Northumberland by George II. , with remainder, in default of heirs male, to Sir Hugh Smythsonj-wBart., the husband of his only daughter Elizabeth. The Duke was subsequently created Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont, with ultimate remainder ta Sir Charles Wyndham, eldest son of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour, who had married the celebrated states man, Sir William Wyndham \u2014 \u2014 \" Wyndham, just to freedom and the throne, The master of our passions and his own.\""], [406, "86 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Duke Algernon died in 1750, when Sir H. Smythson became Earl of Northumberland, and Sir Charles Wyndham, Earl of Egremont and lord of the honour of Petworth. The latter died in 1763, and was succeeded by his son, then only 12 years old. This was George O'Brien Wyndham, third Earl of Egremont, who during the greater part of his long life resided at Petworth, and from his liberal patronage of the arts and sciences became widely known as the M\u00e6cenas of his age. He died in 1837, aged 85 (see \" Sussex Worthies,\" p. 90), leaving his vast possessions to his eldest natural son, the present proprietor, George Wyndham, who was created Baron Leconfield, of Leconfield, co. York, in 1859. Petworth House has always been one of the principal seats in the county. In 1309 Henry de Percy had license to fortify his manors of Petworth and Leconfield. A representation of the old house, which stood on nearly the present site, is given in Vol. xiv, of the \" Sussex Collections.\" It shows in the foreground a large quadrangle with a gateway, and behind it another half finished quadrangle. Fuller says, \" Petworth, the house of the Earls of Northumberland, is most famous for a stately stable, the best of any subject's in Christendon, as it affords stabling in state for three score horses.\" What is now a park of two thousand acres was, in the days of the early Percies, a great forest ; but partly from the ravages of the iron-works, and partly for \u00e6sthetic reasons, Petworth Park, with its ten miles of stone ring fence, has become one of the most celebrated in England for its magnitude, and for its graceful admixture of wood, water, and undulating lawn. Petworth received royal visits from Edward II. and Edward VI. Whether Elizabeth came hither is undecided. George IV. (Prince Regent) was here in 1814, and Queen Victoria in 1846. On the Duke of Somerset's coming into possession he began to pull down the old Percy house and to build the present palatial mansion, which is 322 feet in length, and 62 feet high to the parapet. Its aspect is not pleasing, as, from its monotonous fagade, without any considerable projections or recesses, it more resembles a portion of some great city street than one of the most important baronial mansions in the kingdom. The only part of the old edifice retained is the chapel \u2014 a gloomy apart ment decorated with the arms and devices of the Percies and their alliances. Adequately to describe the interior of Petworth House would require from a critical pen a volume much larger than the present. Its marbles, its pictures, more than 600 in number, executed by more than 200 artists, and its wondrous wood carvings, deserve a special historian. Here are glorious Claudes, and genuine Holbeins and Vandykes, with productions of nearly every other"], [407, "PETWORTH. 87 master both ancient and modern, including several of Turner, marked by the usual exaggerations of that great artist. Many of the portraits are, of course, those of the Percies, Somersets, and Wyndhams, and of Sovereigns contemporaneous with them. For descriptions the reader is referred to \" Murray's Handbook of Sussex,\" \" Waagen's Art Treasures of Great Britain,\" and to a catalogue by A. E. Knox, Esq. The wood-carvings by Grinling Gibbons are truly marvellous, and so indeed are those of Ritson, a northern protege of Lord Egremont, who was employed to complete some of the decorations. The sculptures, which form a large collection, were chiefly purchased at Rome for Charles, Earl of Egremont, who ordered many of them to be supplied with the limbs of which time or violence had deprived them. Hence an id-natured wag once characterized the codection as a \" hospital for decayed statues.\" It will probably be found, how ever, that when adverse criticism has done its worst, common candour will allow that few collections of art in Europe amassed by a private family, can vie with the glories of \" Princely Petworth.\" The church, dedicated to our Lady of Pity or of the Assump tion, contains a chapel of St. Thomas a Becket, and is supposed originady to have belonged to the family of De Alta Ripa, or Dawtrey, formerly influential here. Petworth had a church in Saxon times, and has probably never wanted one since; but modem repairs have so obliterated or concealed ancient features, that a few traces only of Early Decorated and Perpendicular work are to be seen. Indeed, the late Earl of Egremont almost entirely rebuilt the church at a cost of \u00a315,000, about 1827, from designs by Barry, with a spire reaching the altitude of 180 feet. Many Percies he entombed in Becket's chapel with brass plates and other memorials. There are also a fine statue of Lord Egremont in a sitting posture, by Badey, and two tombs of the Dawdreys. In the nave and chancel are some interesting memo rials to the Rectors' and others, one of them to Dr. Wickens, an early work by Flaxman. As a great church prize, Petworth has had many eminent incumbents. Parson Aeon, according to Leland, \" budded the spire of the faire steeple.\" King, the poetical Bishop of Chiehester, was supplanted in Puritan times by the fanatical Dr. Cheyned, the antagonist of Chidingworth. The rectory-house was built by Montague and Duppa, succes sively Bishops of Chiehester, predecessors of King in that see. Dr. John Price was chaplain to General Monk, and aided in the Restoration of Charles II. Charles Dunster, the translator of Aristophanes, was also rector here. Indeed, for a long series of years the rectors of Petworth have been in some way or other distinguished. Notices of some of them wid be found in the"], [408, "88 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. \"Worthies of Sussex,\" viz., John Edmund, p. 326; Richard Montague, p. 116; Brian Duppa, p. 116; King, p. 117; Cheynell, p.309;Dunster,p.343. A fair was formerly kept here for nine consecutive days, but was suspended in the year 1666 in consequence of the plague. Petworth gives name to a beautiful marble composed of univalve freshwater shells, which is found in this and other parts of Sussex. Iron-works were carried on at Petworth, and glass was manu factured between the town and Kirdford, in Glass-house-lane. Petworth has numerous and munificent charities, particularly those founded by Mr. Thompson in 1624, by the Duke of Somerset in 1740, Taylor's 1753, and the Earl ofEgremont's school, 1816. The town consists of a few irregular streets with several excel lent houses. One of these, near the church, was the town residence of the ancient family of Dawtrey, or De Alta Ripa, connections of the Percys, whose \" chiefest house, according to Leland, is in Petworth paroche, caullid the More, half a mile from Petworth toune.\" Moore House was dismantled in 1763, and the remains became a farmstead, which still possesses traces of former importance and heraldric display. The Crescent, the Percy badge, is found on several old houses ; an inn here bears that sign (the Half-Moon), and it is noteworthy that several public-houses between Petworth and London, on the old route of the Percies to court, are also \" Half-Moons.\" Newgrove was the seat of another ancient family, that of De Aula or Hall, whose heiress married Wdliam Peachey in the 17th century. His descendant, Sir Henry Peachey, was created a baronet in 1736, as \"of New Grove.\" It now belongs to Lord Leconfield. According to Mr. Arnold bull-baiting and cock-fighting were practiced at Petworth late in the last century. The Town-hall and market-house, a stone structure, was built in 1793 by the late Earl of Egremont. On one end is a bust of William III., \" in all the glories of his flowing wig.\" In this Had are held the Epiphany and Easter Sessions for the Western division of Sussex.

No place of the same small population and minor impor tance in the South of England can vie in interest with Pevensey. Though now only a simple village street, it represents a great Ro man station and fortress, and a very considerable stronghold of medieval days ; and was the scene of many exciting historical events extending over centuries. It gives name to a hundred, a rape, a rich marsh, and that beautiful expanse of ocean, Pevensey Bay. It also possesses a separate jurisdiction, the \" Lowey \" or liberty, comprising the parishes of Pevensey and Westham, with portions of Hailsham and Bexhill, and is one of the principal limbs or members of the Cinque Ports. The great and fertile plain stretching along the Sussex coast from the eastward of Beachy-head in the direction of Hastings, and inland towards Wartling, Hurst-Monceux, and Hailsham, now studded with great and fat beeves, was at some remote era covered by the sea, and what are known as \" eyes\" or elevations above the surrounding level \u2014 such as Chideyre, Northeye, Hors eye, Rickney, &c, must have been islands, forming a miniature archipelago. As these are all of Saxon meaning, it may be pre sumed that, at the time of Saxon colonization, they were fre quently or constantly insulated. It is almost certain that with in the last thousand years, the waters approached very closely the town and castle of Pevensey, and even so lately as the year 1317, Edward II. granted to one Robert de Sassy, by the annual service of presenting a pair of gilt spurs, certain lands in the"], [410, "90 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. marsh of Pevensey and in the tenure of no man, because over flowed by the \" sea. Like Hastings, Winchelsea, and Seaford, this place has, by the caprices of Father Neptune, lost the port which it once enjoyed, and it now requires almost a stretch of the imagination to believe that royal navies once rode in Pev ensey harbour. Such, however, we have evidence in many an cient records was once the case. What gave importance to the place in the days of the Roman rule in Britain, was the erection of a large fortification or cas trum, which has been undeniably proved to be the station called Andeeida, a word latinized from the British name Andrads wald. The Britons appear to have had a settlement here in earlier times, both from the occasional discovery of British coins, and from the retention of Celtic words as names of places. The Castle of Pevensey, as we now behold it, exhibits two periods ; the one undoubtedly Roman, the other a medieval building, en grafted upon the original structure. The date of the Roman building is inferred to have been of about the commencement of the Lower Empire. In the excavations which, in connection with Mr. C. Roach Smith, F.S.A., I carried on on the spot, we found coins of Gallienus, Postumus, Maximinian, Constantine, the Constantine family, and Magnentius. Other coins of cor responding dates had been previously found on the spot, and they stid frequently turn up.* It was long a matter of arch\u00e6o logical discussion whether Pevensey was the true site of Ande rida. Seven other places have set up their claims to the hon our, but the names of Petrie, Arthur Hussey, Roach Smith, and Thomas Wright are arrayed on this side. The arguments are too lengthened for even a precis here ; nor is it necessary, as the site is now fixed here by common consent. After the withdrawment of the Romans from Britain, some of the native Britons took up their residence in and around this stronghold, from which they were expelled by \u00c6lla, the Saxon invader, and first king of the South Saxons. After the utter subjugation of the former, the Saxons gave to this place the name of Andredes-ceaster. The siege and subsequent slaughter of the poor inhabitants are described by ancient chroniclers as dreadful in the extreme. It is not until the year 792 that Pev ensey appears under its modem appellation. It was then given, together with Hastings and Rotherfield, by the Saxon Duke Bertwald, to the abbey of St. Denis near Paris, in return for a * The most remarkable coins ever found here are those of some of the Bactrian Kings, Radpluses, MWenander, and Apollodotus, who flourished about 200 years B. C. How these relics of a dynasty founded by one of the Generals of Alexander the Great came hither, it is difficult to judge. Discredit has been cast on their discovery, but that they were found beneath the walls of Pevensey Castle is proved by undoubted evidence. See my Chronicles of Pevensey, 2nd edition, p. i."], [411, "91 PEVENSEY. miraculous cure wrought on him by the bones of St. Denis himself, and thoseof others in that holy place. Here occurs another hiatus until a. d. 1042, but from that date a pretty connected history of Pevensey exists. In that year Swane, Earl of Oxford, a son of Godwin Earl of Kent, who had been compelled to fly into Denmark for attempting an dlegal marriage with Edgiva, Abbess of Leominster, returning to England with eight ships, landed at the port of Pevensey. In 1049, Earl Godwin and his son entered the port and took away many ships. The crowning event in the history of Pevensey was the land ing there of William, Duke of Normandy, 28th September, 1066, a few days previously to his victory over Harold at the Battle of Hastings. The particulars of the chain of events con nected with the Norman Conquest belong rather to general than local history ; but several papers and notes in \" Sussex Arch\u00e6o logical Collections\" serve for illustration. The celebrated piece of needlework, known as the Bayeux Tapestry, contains a repre sentation of the landing ad Pevenesae, the drawing up of the ships, the disembarkation of the horses and men, and several horsemen gadoping towards Hastings in search of food for the army. On the partition of the conquered lands, William bestowed the Rape of Pevensey (more than a sixth part of the comity of Sussex) on his half-brother, Robert, Earl of Mortaigne, or Moreton, besides many others in other counties, amounting altogether to nearly 800 manors, of which 54 were in Sussex. He doubtless restored the outer wads of the Roman Castle, long a partial ruin, and added the little, or medieval castle, within the enceinte of the older fortification, making it at the same time the. caput baroni\u00e6 of his Sussex estate. In 1067 William returned to Normandy to receive the congra tulations of his ancient subjects, taking with him as hostages Edgar Atheling, Archbishop Stigand, and others. He deter mined to sail from the same port at which he had landed, and accordingly embarked from Pevensey in the spring of the year. Domesday contains a detailed account of Pevensey in 1086. It was in the territory of the Earl of Mortaigne. In the reign of the Confessor that king held 24 burgesses in domain, the toll producing 20s., port-dues 35s., and the pasturage 7s. 3d. rent. The Bishop of Chiehester had five burgesses, and three priests had amongst them 23 \u2014 total of burgesses in domain 52. At the time of the Earl's succession to the manor there were but 27, but twenty years later, at the making of the Record, the number arose to 109, and the toll produced \u00a34. Thus it would appear that the Normans improved the condition of Pevensey in the early days of their ride. The town had a mint, which is men-"], [412, "92 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. tioned. In the remarkable discovery of 26,500 coins at Bea worth, Hants, some years since, there were some struck at this place, with the name of the moneyer \u2014 Jelfhen-Pefns. In 1088, on the death of the Conqueror, the Earl of More ton espoused the cause of Robert, against the usurpation of Rufus. Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, \" a great tamer of the English,\" espoused the former side, held Pevensey Castle against Rufus, and sustained a six weeks' siege, but the Earl was at length compelled to succumb to the government of the usurper. He survived him, however, and after his death in the New Forest was favoured with a remarkable vision. According to Dug dale, \" at the very hour that the King received the fatal wound, De Mortaigne, hunting in a lonely wood, in a place remote from the scene of the accident, was met by a very black goat, carrying the body of the King, ' all black and naked, and wounded through the midst of his breast.' The Earl adjuring the goat by the Holy Trinity to tell him what it was he so carried, the goat replied, ' I am carrying your king to judg ment, yea, that tyrant William Rufus ; for I am an evil spirit, and the revenger of the malice which he bore to the Church of God !' \" The Earl was succeeded by his son William, who being opposed to the interests of Henry I. was taken prisoner at the battle of Tenerchebrai, at the same time as Duke Robert, and like that unfortunate prince lost his liberty, his eyes, and his patrimony. The last was, in 1104, conferred by Henry upon Gilbert de Aquila, grandson of a Norman knight of the same name who fell at Hastings. From him the barony of Pevensey received the designation of \" The Honour of the Eagle,\" which it retained long after the extinction of the family. De Aquila was a personal friend of Henry I., and lost three children in the shipwreck of the \" Blanche Nef,\" off Barfleur, in which the King's son and heir likewise perished on their voyage from Nor mandy. He was succeeded in 1118 by his son Richard de Aquila, a turbulent spirit, engaged in war with the English monarch, and had his English estate confiscated. He was also in arms against the King of France, who retaliated by burning his town and castle of Aquila in Normandy. King Henry con doned the offence against himself, but in 1127 he was again in open rebellion, and passed over to Normandy without the royal license, when his broad lands were again taken from him, and the Honour of the Eagle was granted by the King to his grandson Fitz-Empress, subsequently Henry II. The annals of Pevensey during these troublous times form a kind of epitome of Englisb bistory, its successive lords having been mixed up with nearly every great event. In 1144, during the struggle between Stephen and the son of Maude, its castle was besieged by Stephen"], [413, "93 PEVENSEY. in person, who, finding it impregnable by force, reduced it by famine. The fortress at this time was under the command of Gilbert de Clare. In the treaty which followed between Stephen and Henry, it was stipulated that Pevensey and the other pos sessions of the outlaw, Richard de Aquila, should be settled upon William, son of King Stephen, who held them till Henry II. 's accession in \"1^54. This sovereign with great gene rosity reinstated Richard de Aquila in the honour of Pevensey, and the old rebel, growing penitent, gave to the Abbey of Gres tein his manor of Willingdon, the herbage in his forest of Pevensey (Ashdown), and the tithes of Pevensey. In 1176 another Gilbert de Aquila succeeded to the Honour of the Eagle. He appears to have been of a more tranquil nature, the only mention of him being that he paid =\u00a321 17s. 6d. towards the fund collected for the redemption of Richard C\u0153ur-de-Lion out of the hands of his Austrian captors. In 1195 that monarch granted to John de Palerne the custody of the castle gate of Pevensey. In 1205 a third Gilbert de Aquila, son of the pre ceding lord, succeeded, but being guilty of many excesses, and having gone over to Normaudy without royal license, he for feited all his estates, which were never restored to the family. He founded Michelham Priory, in the parish of Arlington, temp. Henry III. In 1208 King John granted to the barons (freemen) of Peven sey, on payment of 40 marks into the Exchequer, license to build anew town between Pevensey and Langney, but there is no evi dence of the design having been carried out. In 1216 William, sixth Earl of Warenne, was in temporary possession of the castle, but having sided with the Dauphin of France against King John, the latter sent him a precept to deliver it np to Matthew Fitz-Herbert, who was commanded to demolish it, but happily that order was not fulfilled. In 1235 Henry III. granted the lordship, on conditions, to Gilbert Marshal, Earl of Pem broke, but he was deprived 24th Henry III., and in the fodow ing year he lost his life in a tournament. In 1241 the same king granted it to Peter of Savoy, his Queen's uncle, for life. In 1264 John, Earl of Warenne, having deserted Henry at the battle of Lewes, fled to this castle, which had been committed to his charge, and embarked the next day for France. The fol lowing year De Savoy's troops held out here for the King, and Simon de Montfort, son of the Earl of Leicester, besieged it, but was compelled to retire. In 1269 the honour and castle were settled upon Prince Edward (afterwards Edward I.), and they continued in tha. Crown till temp. Edward III. Among the custodians of the fortress during that period we find the names of Palerne, Bode, De la Gare, Sassy, and Newente, most of"], [414, "94 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. whom belonged to Sussex families. In 44th Edward 11T. tha.t monarch settled Pevensey and its dependencies upon John of Gaunt, \" time-honoured Lancaster,\" and from that time the Honour of the Eagle became part of the Duchy of Lancaster. The duke granted the office of constable for life to Sir John Pel ham in 1394, and on the usurpation of the Crown by Henry, Duke of Lancaster (Henry IV.) Pelham adhered to the son of his old master, and landed with him in Yorkshire to oppose his cousin Richard. The Vorkist party attacked Pevensey Castle, which was gallantly held out on behalf of her husband and the King, 1399, by Lady Pelham, the wife of Sir John. She was besieged by many of the forces of Sussex, Surrey, and Kent. During the siege she wrote a letter to her husband, stating the dangers by which she was beset, and the difficulty she had in obtaining provisions. This epistle, which is of great interest, has been several times printed, and it is supposed by Hallam to be the earliest specimen of epistolary correspondence by a lady in the English language. \" Strange eventful history \" all this : but there is more yet to come. In reward of his eminent services to the Lancastrian cause, Henry IV. granted to Pelham and his heirs the office of Constable of Pevensey Castle, with the Honour of the Eagle and all lands and rights thereto appurtenant. This was in 1400; in 1405, Edward, Duke of York, being charged with abetting the escape of the Earl of March and his brother from Windsor, the king committed him to the custody of Sir John, who held him prisoner here. The unfortunate prince seems to have received great kindness from Thomas Playsted, his gentleman -keeper, in the fortress, for in his will dated 1415, is this item : \" I bequeath to Thomas Pleistede \u00a320 for the kind ness which he showed me when I was in ward at Pevensey.\" Again, in 1419 we have the record of a still more illustrious prisoner. Queen Joan of Navarre, the last wife of Henry IV., and step-mother of the reigning king, being accused, with her confessor, of the practice of necromancy and sorcery, with intent to take away the monarch's life, she was committed to the charge of Sir John Pelham, son of the Sir John before-men-. tioned. Here she remained prisoner for nine years, until the second year of Henry VI., when she was restored to her dower. In 1461 Sir William Fynes (who was afterwards slain at Barnet fight) was appointed Constable for life ; and in 1478, 9 the Castle and its appendages were settled on Elizabeth, queen-consort of Edward IV., for life. From this date the records are very scanty : the office of Constable was still existing in 1553, when Richard Oxenbridge held it. In 1587 a survey of the Sussex coast was made with a"], [415, "95 PEVENSEY. view to its defence against the threatened invasion of the Spaniards. In this document, (just published by Mr. Baxter, of Lewes) the haven of Pevensey is shown running in a direc tion nearly due east of the Castle. At this point orders are made to construct two rampiers, one on each side. Other di rections are given, including one which was happily not carried out ; namely that, \" The Castle of Pemsey is to be re-edified or utterly rased! \" In 1650 a survey was made, by the Parliamen tary commissioners. The manor is described as \" the manor of Pevensey, alias Pemsey, sometimes styled the honour of Aquda, in the parishes of Pevensey, Westham, Haylsham, Bexhill, &c. The materials of the old castle are valued at \u00a340.\" Thanks to John Warr, of Westminster, the purchaser, who did not pull down these venerable walls ! In 1660 Pevensey was settled upon Henrietta, the queen-dowager. It was held as royal property untd Widiam III. granted it to the Bentincks, who sold it to the Right Honourable Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington and Viscount Pevensey. In 1 755 it descended to his son Charles, Earl of Northampton, whose daughter marrying in 1782 Lord George Augustus Cavendish, Earl of Burlington, conveyed it into the family of the present noble owner, the Duke of Devon shire, who, among his numerous styles and titles, may write himself \" Dominus Aquil\u00e6.\" For the last two or three centuries the history of the Castle has been an eventless one of desolation and gradual decay, though its sturdy walls will doubtless remain for centuries to delight the artistic eye, and furnish matter for the retrospective phdosopher ancl antiquary. It is worthy of remark that in 1846, the Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Society held their first general meet ing within the wads of this, the most ancient building in the county. On that occasion I read a paper which comprised most of the main facts mentioned above, which became the basis of my little work called the \" Chronicles of Pevensey.\" Some years later Mr. Roach Smith, F.S.A., and myself conducted excavations here, and the results of our discoveries were pub lished in Vol. vi. of the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" but much more fully, in 1858, in a monograph by Mr. Smith, whose acquaintance with Roman remains is so widely known, under the title of \" Report on Excavations made on the site of the Roman Castrum at Pevensey.\" To this able production reference must be made for minute architectural details, but a brief description is given below. \" Of all the Roman walled Castra in England,\" observes the learned author, \" that of Pevensey presents the highest claims to our admiration. It is among the largest in extent ; it is the best preserved ; and approached either from the east or west its"], [416, "96 HISTORY OF S.USSEX. appearance is grand and imposing. The dilapidations not being seen, the visitor views it in much the same condition as it pre sented itself to the eyes of the Romans themselves.\" .... yet \" fifteen centuries stand between himself and the builders. But this long space of time has passed ; thirty (fifty ?) generations of men have gone to dust, while the walls and towers before him seem yet only in their maturity, or, at the worst, in a vigorous old age. Let him tear aside the ivy that clings to the facing of the wall, and he will find the course of the mason's trowel marked as freshly as if the tool had smoothed the mortar only a few months since ! \"* The Castle lies westward of the town of Pevensey, between it and the pleasant village street of Westham. In shape it ap proximates to an oval, having its longest diameter nearly east and west. The outward enclosure (the wads of the ancient Anderida), now a pasture-field, contains about 8-J- acres. The inner fortification or medieval castle, about 1^ acres. The exter nal walls are nearly entire, the greatest hiatus being on the south, through which there is a fine view of the Bay. The principal entrance is at the east end of Westham-street, and is flanked with two towers of nearly horse-shoe form. There are six other towers of similar shape on the north side, more or less ruinated, but still in remarkable preservation. The medieval castle is an irregular pentagon, and its gateway is flanked by two round towers much dilapidated ; three more towers are still standing, and the remains of others are traceable. Part of the moat remains. The outer or Roman walls are upwards of twenty feet high and of vast thickness, and exhibit, in various parts, strata of Roman tiles. The Normans evidently added to the height of the walls in some places, and one of the towers has a remarkable superposition of a Norman structure upon it, which was evidently designed as a watch-tower, as it commands a view land-ward over a great tract of country ; but as just intimated I cannot enter into the many architectural details of this most venerable ruin. I must, however, say a few words respecting the researches which Mr. Roach Smith and myself made in 1852. We commenced operations in July, and continued them throughout the year. It was proved that the massive flanking towers of the gateway, 28 feet apart, had originally been flanked by a wad, and that in it was the true porta or grand gate of the fortress. Fragments of imbrices or roof tiles from the original roof of the gateway were found, with a third-brass coin of Con stantine, and at a higher level a penny of Canute. We next opened out a postern or minor gateway passing obliquely through * Report, p. 12."], [417, "PEVENSEY. 97 the northern wall, and to this the name of \" Roach Smith's gate\" was subsequently given. On the south side, where the wall had long since disappeared, we discovered by deep excavations that such a defence had originally existed, with a very smad postern, though it had been a prevalent notion that water in that part had been a sufficient safeguard. In Roman times the sea must have reached almost as far as the wall. A landslip at this point is the probable cause of the disappearance of the fortifications. Li the \" little \" or medieval castle, we discovered the foundations of the free chapel of Pevensey Castle, which is frequently men tioned in ancient records. It must have consisted of nave, north aisle and chancel, with walls thirty inches thick. Below the level of the floor of 'the chancel were found several skeletons, one of which having the arm-bones crossed over the chest, is presumed to be that of a priest. At the west end of the church a font of circular cup-shaped form was found in situ, though much fractured, and at the east end the basin or head of a pillar piscina of Early English character. A short time pre viously the well of the fortress had been discovered near the chapel. It is seven feet in diameter, and steined with solid ashlar. From the depth of about fifty feet, many skulls, said to have been those of wolves, were brought up, as well as several large round balls of sandstone, which were doubtless the pro jectdes discharged in old warfare by the catapult. The parish church of St. Nicholas, the patron saint of Pevensey and of mariners, consists of nave, chancel, and north and south aisles, with a tower on the north side of the north aisle. The latter is very low, and supports a shingled spire. The prevailing style of the building is Early English. The columns of the nave are alternately octagonal and clustered. The chancel arch is lofty and acutely pointed. The capitals are beautifully foliated. The chancel is very long, with three lancet windows at the east end. There are brass plates in the south aisle for Edward Mdlward, 1619, and Elinor his wife, 1614. On the north wall ofthe chancel is an elaborate monument with the marble effigies of John Wheatley, gent., 1616, his wife Elizabeth, and Katherine, \" their only davghter and heire.\" The Corporation of Pevensey is a member of the Cinque-port of Hastings, and is governed by a bailiff, jurats, and commonalty. It comprises the parishes of Pevensey, Westham, ancl the south portion of Hailsham ; originally portions of Bexhill and Wartling were included, thus making the liberty, leuga, or lowey, as it is sometimes called, almost co-extensive with the Marsh. The prison, with a court-house over it, resembles an old cottage. There are many peculiar customs and privileges. The corpora tion seal is a very curious piece of antiquity, exhibiting on the VOL. II. H"], [418, "98 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. obverse an antique ship, and on the reverse two ships in full sail. It is probably of the 13th century. The decline of Pevensey from its ancient importance to the condition of a small village of less than 400 inhabitants, has rendered its little municipality the butt of local satire, and many anecdotes reflecting upon the assumed ignorance of the natives are in existence; one especially, that the grand jury once found \u00a3_ prisoner guilty of manslaughter for stealing a pair of leather breeches, is a standing jest. These stories, or some of them, probably originated with Andrew Borde, once resident here, one of the most singular personages of the 16th century, and said to have been the prototype of Merry Andrews. He was in turn a Carthusian Friar, physician to Henry VIII., a quack-doctor at country fairs, a traveller in many lands, an author on various subjects, a court favourite, and a political spy. He finished his career as a prisoner in the Fleet in the year 1549. See \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 27. [S. A. C. Corporate seal, i, 21. Custumal of, iv, 209. xviii, 42.

For speculations on the reason for this form of tower see Hussey, p. 267. There are inscriptions for the families of Faulconer and Waterman. Deans in this parish was the seat ofthe family of Heath in the 16th and 17th centuries. On the road-side near the village is a chalk pit, in teresting to geological observers. Piddinghoe produces bricks and pottery. A local witticism runs that the inhabitants \" shoe their magpies !\" [S. A. C. Magpies shod here ! xiii, 210. Bells, xvi, 220.

Domesday, Pleidenham ; a parish on the Bother, in the Hundred of Gold- spur ; Bape of Hastings ; distant f of a mile north from Bye, its Post-town, Bailway- station, and Union. Population in 1811, 223 ; in 1861, 305. Benefice, a Bectory, annexed to East Guldeford ; Patron, Bev. C. Shrubb ; Incumbent, Bev. Charles Meade Bamus, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begis- ter, 1714. Acreage, 1,308. The surface has pleasing undulations, and towards East Guldeford there is a promontory of rock, caused by the ancient washing of the Rother, and called Playden Cliff. Sandrock Hill commands a good coast view. The village has the singular alias of Sauket, or Salt-cot, Street, with reference, it is said, to the fisheries of Rye ; but this I much doubt, as simdar names are found in various parts of the world, remote from sea and from salt. The word is probably derived from Sanscrit roots ; e. g., there is a military station at the foot of the Himalayas caded Sealcote. Before the Conquest, Playden was held of the Confessor by one Siulf, and here another probability crops up ; may not the name be rendered \" Siulf 's cote,\" or habitation ? J h 2"], [420, "100 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. After the Conquest the Earl of Eu held it in person, and there was a church. Portions of the manors of Playden-Mascall and Playden-Porter lie in the parish. The ancient family of De Guldeford and the Abbey of Robertsbridge had lands here. The charitable establishment called the Hospital of St. Bar tholomew of Rye is close outside that town, but in this parish. It belonged to the Norman abbey of Fecamp. It was originally founded for leprous persons, but when that disease died out, it became an almshouse for the poor. In 1379, an inquisition shows that one Robert Burton, master of the hospital, had cut down timber and sold crops from the lands of the establishment for his own behoof, and to the detriment of the poor inmates, who were obliged daily to beg their bread in Rye. After the Dissolution the site was granted to Andrew, Lord Windsor. A list of the wardens ofthe house, from 1343 to 1478, is given by Mr. Slade Butler in \" Sussex Collections,\" xii, 136. A free chapel here is said to have been given by Henry VII. towards the building of the Chapel of the Virgin in Westminster Abbey. The church (St. Michael) includes a nave with aisles, central tower with shingled spire, and chancel. The columns of the arcades which divide the nave from the aisles are alternately round andoctagonal. There are memorials for the names of Legg, Clerk, and others ; and an incised slab commemorates a Flemish brewer of the fifteenth century, with barrels, mash-stick, and fork, jfyin is trgtabc' (Cornells Zortmanns, fciiit bocr be jtcle. \u2014 \" Here is interred Cornelius Zoctmanns.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1558. Acreage, 2,423. Chief Landowner, the Earl of Chiehester. The parish lies principally on the northern side of the"], [421, "101 PLUMPTON. South Downs, the escarpment of which is here very steep and lofty. Above it is a kind of \" table land\" unusual on these bills, called Plumpton Plain, where, according to tradition, some in cidents of the battle of Lewes occurred. On the escarpment is a very large cross-patee incised in the turf, and visible at times from a great distance. Originally it was bared to the chalk, like the celebrated White Horse, and our Wilmington Giant of yore, but it is now overgrown with turf. Its origin and purpose are alike unknown. The manor belonged to Earl Godwin, and after the Conquest to the Earls of Warenne. In later times it was held by the great Norman family of Bardolf (many particulars of whom are given in Stapleton's \" Liber de Antiq. Leg.\"), and from them descended successively to William, Pbelip Lord Bardolf, Viscount Beaumont, and Lord Hastings. On the attainder of this race for then- adherence to the Lancastrian cause, it was forfeited to the Crown. It was afterwards granted to Sir John Fagg, but in 1522 it was vested in the ancient proprietors, who had been restored in blood, and then belonged to Elizabeth, wife of John, Earl of Oxford, widow of William, Viscount Beau mont, Lord Bardolf. Queen Elizabeth granted it to Sir Nicholas Carew, who died possessed of it in 1590. In 1627 Sir Henry Delves was lord, and in 1663 Anthony Springett. In the latter family it continued until 1763, when it passed by purchase to that of Pelham, its present owners. Among the Crown tenants of the manor were the Mascalls, who resided at Plumpton Place. One of this family, Leonard Mascall, wrote several books on rural pursuits, and he is said to have first introduced carp into England, placing them in the moat which surrounded his man sion.* He was also a grower of pippins, and a breeder of cattle, sheep, dogs, &c. He flourished in the sixteenth century, but the date of his death is unknown. (See \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 53.) Plumpton Place still retains its moat and its carp, but the venerable mansion, shorn of its original importance, is now only the habitation of cottagers. The church consists of a chancel, nave, with south porch and west tower, with shingled spire, and has featmes of Transition- Norman, Early English, and Perpendicular work. (Hussey.) Within are memorials for the families of Springett, Walker, Woodward, and Hampton. The last-named family, now repre sented by the families of Weekes and Borrer, held the advowson 200 years.

A parish in the Hundred of its own name ; Bape of Arundel ; distant three miles south-east from Arundel, its Post-town ; Bailway station, Angmering, distant about 1^ mile. Union, East Preston. Popu- lation in 1811, 148; in 1861, 203. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at =\u00a3158; Patron, the Bishop of Chiehester ; Incumbent, Bev. T.Trough- ton Leete, M.A., of Caius College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1558. Acreage, 923. As no mention of Poling is found in Domesday, Dallaway thinks it was carved out of Angmering, and made a distinct hundred at a later date. On the partition of the earldom of Arundel in 1244 the hundred \u00ab=nd manor of Poling were adotted to John Fitz-Alan. In 1381 they were settled upon the newly founded college of Arundel. In 1568 Sir John Caryll was lord. It was afterwards incorporated with the Michelgrove estate. From the Walker family, who held that property, it passed by sale, in 1828, to Bernard-Edward, Duke of Norfolk. A small Commandery of Knights-Templars was established here, pro bably on the endowment of one of the Fitz-Alan family. It afterwards passed to the Knights-Hospitallers. A chapel, with chambers for three knights, remained, having been used as a farmhouse, until about 1830, when it was fitted up as a private residence. A view, as it stood in 1780, is preserved among the Burrell MSS. The impropriation was given to the Abbey of Almenesche, in Normandy, and was transferred in the thirteenth century to the nunnery of Lyminster. The vicar is endowed with the whole tythes. The church (St. Nicholas) appears to have been partly rebuilt about the beginning of the fifteenth century, and com- prises chancel, nave, south aisle, and west tower. There are Transition -Norman features. The passage to the rood-loft is stdl open. There is a half-length brass to EMaltet Habg, vicar in the fifteenth century, and an inscription to Robert Dyneham, vicar, 1707.

Frederick George Holbrook, M.A. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1666. Acreage, 2,006. Chief Landowners, Bev. Wm. Hall, and Edw. Blaker, Esq. This sea-side parish, though only on an average a mile in breadth, is four mdes long. I have before remarked that in the majority of Sussex parishes these oblong dimensions are found, and that their general direction is north and south. The village occupies a pleasant declivity of the South Downs, and commands excedent land and sea-views. The parish contains several man sions and residences, particularly the Manor-House, belonging to the Borrer family, Portslade House to the Rev. W. Hall, East Hill to Edward Blaker, Esq., and Portslade Lodge to Miss Borrer. In Domesday, Portslade is stated to have been held by Osward, who also possessed it before the Conquest. It was exempt from land-tax, and the owner could change his residence at pleasure, and sell his property if he would \u2014 a noble instance of the liber ality of Norman times ! In 2nd Henry III., the celebrated Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent,* who had married Beatrice de Warenne, became possessed of the manor in dower, and in 13th Henry III., Margaret, his daughter, by Margaret his wife, sister of Alexander, King of Scotland, was owner. From this period the manor frequently changed hands, and it has belonged to the families of De Grelly, De la Warr, Pelham, Sneding, Edwards, Fawkenor, Westbrook, Andrew, Foley, Watson, Davies, Lamb, Phillips, and Borrer. Near the church-yard are the ruins of the ancient manor-house, described by Mr. Hussey as \" stid exhibit ing two tolerably perfect double-light round-headed windows. * This eminent personage is said to have been the greatest subject in Europe. He was Chief Justiciary of England and Ireland, Governor of the Tower, and Castellan of Windsor. For a full notice of him see \" Burke's Extinct Peerage,\" p. 97."], [424, "HISTORY OF SUSSEX. 104 Of one the dividing mudion has a decidedly Norman capital. One fragment of wall is three feet three inches thick, and seems to have been overthrown by violence.\" Mr. Hussey considers that the latest date that can be assigned to this ruin is the Early English period. I should regard it as a fragment of Norman work. The church (St. Nicholas) consists of a chancel, nave, south aisle, and west tower. The chancel is Early English, with three seddia and a piscina under trefoiled arches. Other portions of the building are in different styles, ranging from Transition- Norman to Perpendicular. In 1847 some mural paintings were discovered in this church, the subject being the Day of Judg ment. The tower contains three beds, but not of very ancient date. There are mortuary inscriptions to the names of Clutton, Edwards, Cooke, Woodcock, Carpenter, Blaker, Borrer, and others. It would appear that this parish anciently gave name to a family called De Portslade, as a Ralph de Portslade was accused, in 1303, of an offence against the Abbot of Bayham. Curious details of the transaction are given in Vol. xi. of the \" Sussex Collections.\" Like many other places on the Sussex Coast, Portslade has suffered much from the encroachments of the sea. The claim of this village to have been the Portus Adurni of Roman times, is not wed supported, as it has been pretty wed established that Bramber is the site of that station. Many Roman remains have, however, been found in the parish. Copperas Gap is a hamlet of this parish. It is on the road from Brighton to Shoreham. The population and houses have greatly increased in consequence of the formation of a canal towards Brighton, with a view to the supply of that town with coals and other commodities. A new district church (St. Andrew) has been erected for the popula tion. Patron, the Bishop of Chiehester. [S. A. C. Mural paintings in church, i, 161. Ealph de Portslade, xi, 124.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1558. Acreage, 1,643. An elaborate account of this parish by the Rector opens"], [425, "105 POYNINGS. the 15th volume ofthe \" Sussex Collections.\" The parish gives name to a hundred, and is situated partly upon, and partly at the base of, the South Down range. It is full of romantic beauty. In a charter of King Eadgar, the name is written Puningas ; the termination ingas means here, as in numerous other cases, offspring or descendants ; hence this place must have been colonized, in early Saxon days, by some member of that race. Whether some such word as Pun or Puna existed as a personal name, does not appear. According to Domesday, William Fitz-Rainald held Poninges of Widiam de Warenne. Earl Godwin had previously presented it to Cola. It was as sessed under both at eight hides, but paid no land-tax. The arable was thirteen plough-lands ; there were two ploughs in the demesne and twenty-five villeins, and eight bondmen hav ing fifteen ploughs. There were a church, two ministri, two mids, fifty acres of meadow, and a wood of forty hogs. In the time of the Confessor it was valued at \u00a312, and was, at the date of the Survey, worth but \u00a310. This description clearly refers to a much larger area than that comprised within the limits of the modern Poynings. Fitz-Rainald was son of Rainald, second brother of Robert de Pierpoint, Lord of Hurst-Pierpoint. Temp. Stephen, its possessors took the name of De Ponynges, and the family, afterwards ennobled, held the manor during nearly three centuries, and for eleven generations in the male line. The first of the family ennobled was Sir Michael, who was sum moned to Parliament in 1294 as Baron de Ponynges. His son Thomas was summoned to Parliament by King Edward in. in 1337. In 1339 he perished in a great sea-fight with the French near Sluys. His son followed the standard of the same monarch in all his foreign wars from 1339 to 1355. He was created a Knight-Banneret at Cressy, and was present at the surrender of Calais, and also at the battle of Poic tiers. He died in 1369, having jointly with his wife founded the existing church of Poynings. In his will, proved in 1369, is the fodowing noticeable bequest : \"I demise to him who may be my heir, a ruby ring, which is the charter of my heritage of Poynings, together with the helmet and armour which my father demised to me.\" Thomas, 4th Baron Poynings, who was born at Slaugham, where the family appear to have possessed an estate, carried out the rebuilding ofthe church in accordance with the wish of his parents. He died without issue, and his brother Richard succeeded. The latter was summoned to Parlia ment 1382-5 ; attended the Black Prince in his campaign in Spain; and died of disease at Vidalpando in Leon. His son Robert, born in 1380, succeeded to the barony. He served in France under Richard IL, with 30 men-at-arms and 60 archers,"], [426, "106 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. and later, under Henry IV., V., VI., with 60 men-at-arms, and 180 archers, and was indeed, botb in war and diplomacy, one of tbe greatest men of his time. He died in 1446. His eldest son, knight of the sbire for Sussex, died before his father, in 1430. He had a son and a daughter ; the son predeceased him, and the latter, Eleanor, on the death of her grandfather, the last Baron, became his heir. She married Sir Henry Percy, son and heir of Henry, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, thus conveying a very ex tensive estate into that illustrious house. The successive Barons de Poynings formed alliances with numerous important famdies, but now the name became extinct in the elder male line. The barony of Poynings merged in the superior dignity, and has ever since formed one of the subordinate titles of the Earls and Dukes of Northumberland. Sir Henry was summoned to Parlia ment in his wife's barony, and so continued until 1455, when he succeeded to the paternal Earldom. He espoused the Lan castrian cause, and fed while commanding its forces, at Towton fight in 1461. Thenceforward the Poynings blood was lost in the still more idustrious name of Percy. There were other per sons of historical distinction collaterady descended from this ancient race. Sir Edward Poynings, K.G., who flourished under Kings Henry VII. and VIII., was grandson of Robert, the 6th Baron. He was Lord-Deputy of Ireland, and caused a series of laws of a highly beneficial kind to be enacted in the Irish Parlia ment of 1494, 5, assimilating the Irish laws to the English. His code was long known as \" Poynings' Law,\" and was only re pealed at the close of the last century. He was a great warrior and a thoughtful statesman. Lloyd, in his \" State Worthies,\" says of him : \" A serious and plodding brow bespoke this noble knight's deep prudence, and a smart look his resolved valour ; who was a man vastly different in his publick capacity from what he was in private employment \u2014 ' Quemquam posse putas mores narrare f uturos ? Die niihi, si fias tu leo, qualis eris.' \" He held important trusts at Boulogne, Tournay, and in the Cinque Ports, and was much connected with state employments in the court of Henry VIII. His dlegitimate son, Sir Thomas Poynings, also distinguished himself in military affairs, and was successively Marshal of Calais and Governor of Boulogne. In 1545 a second barony of Poynings was created in his favour, but he died shortly afterwards without issue, and the title expired with him. In 1535 Algernon, 6th Earl of Northumberland, sold this estate to Henry VIII., who granted it in exchange for other manors, to his favourite, Sir Anthony Browne, K.G., ancestor of"], [427, "107 POYNINGS. the Viscounts Montague, and in that family it continued until its extinction, and it is now vested in the Crown, under the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. Mr. Holland gives in his paper a fud ecclesiastical history of the parish. The church (Holy Trinity) was in the patron age of the Earls of Warenne, who gave it to Lewes Priory. A chantry of ancient foundation, dedicated to St. Mary, was long associated with the rectory. Its founder, doubtless one of the Lords Poynings, cannot be identified ; but the 70 acres of land in Pyecombe, still attached to the rectory, and called the chantry, no doubt supplied the revenue of that foundation. The church is a cruciform building of beautiful and striking aspect \u2014 very superior in the ensemble to most of the churches of the district. Its large embattled tower, with its spacious nave, chancel and transepts, form altogether a cathedral-like group, very pleasant to behold. It is constructed of chalk and rubble, and cased with dressed flints. The dressings are chiefly of the yellow sandstone still dug in the district, and the original roofing was of Horsham stone. The interior is grand in its proportions. Four noble arches support the tower, and the east window is a striking object. The north transept is known as the Montague Chapel, and the south as the Poynings Chapel. The latter was long walled off, and in fact consigned to almost utter darkness, damp, and decay, as if the last resting place of a long line of chivalrous and pious lords of Poynings were a thing of nought ! Thanks, however, to the late Dr. Holland, rector, and Hugh, 3rd Duke of Northumberland, this state of things was changed in 1842. Old monumental stones were replaced near their original sites, but they cannot be identified with any ofthe particular personages whose remains they covered. There are traces of brasses, and embossed crosses on some of them, but the only one whereof the inscription can be read has on it a memorial in Lombardic characters to the \" UattlfttC be iSiSSCl, de la Bor. . .\" It had a floriated cross and shield, but these, with the brass letters which formerly passed round the verge of the stone, have been torn away by sacrilegious hands. Of the connection of this \" Damette \" (or unmarried lady) with the baronial family nothing is known. Over the chancel window, outside and over the porch, are the arms of Poynings. Some of the few encaustic tiles remaining have the arms of Richard, king of the Romans, brother of Henry III. In the chancel are three sedilia and a piscina under ogee arches, with-a hood moulding. In a window of tbe north transept is a representation in ancient glass of the Annunciation. The font is octagonal, with ogee panels, and coeval with the church. Of Poynings Place, the old baronial mansion, few remains"], [428, "108 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. exist. It was probably deserted on the extinction of the family, and the Percys ancl Montagues had greater houses elsewhere. A drawing by Grimm in 1780, in the Burrell Collections, repre sents a lofty tower, a relic of the original edifice, and traces of terraces and avenues may still be noticed by the antiquarian eye. In 1727, a great part of the then existing remains was destroyed by fire, and in 1824 what remained of the tower fed down, so that it may now be said of this once noble fabric \u2014 \" Etiam periere ruin\u00e6.\" In this parish is the remarkable chasm of the South Downs, known as the Devil's Dyke, which looks almost like a work of art. So accurately are its sloping sides shaped, that we might imagine that some gigantic power had been employed to cut a cleft or gorge through the solid hill. Connected with it is an earthwork called the \" Poor-man's wall,\" evidently a corrup tion of other words. The entrenchment is oval, and nearly a mile in circumference. The fact of a few Roman coins having been found here does not disprove a much higher antiquity. From the summit of the Dyke Hill there is a view hardly equalled in the South of England. It is said to embrace, under favour able lights, portions of six counties. Certainly the grand Weald is no where seen to greater advantage, while southward there is an extensive seaboard view, including Brighton, Shoreham, Worthing, and, occasionally, the Isle of Wight. On this height is an inn caded the Dyke-House, which is the constant resort of pleasure parties from Brighton. The great geological chasm is popularly ascribed to the agency of Satan. Let our Sussex loving antiquary, the late Mr. William Hamper, F.S.A., tell the story ; for, although \" decies Tepetita, placebit.\" \u2014 \" Five hundred years ago or more, or if you please in days of yore, That wicked wight 'yclept Old Nick, renowned for many a wanton triek, With envy, from the Downs beheld, the studded Churches of the Weald ; Here, Poynings cruciform, and there, Hurst, Albourne, Bolney, Newtimber, Cuckfield and more, with towering crest ; Qu\u00e6 nunc pr\u0153scribere longum est ; Oft heard the undulating chime, proclaim around twas service time.

It is beautifully situated in a dale near the north-east out skirts of Brighton, and contains, \"besides Preston Place (the manor-house), many excellent residences. The Brighton cavalry barracks and water-works are in the parish. At no distant date the village will become, like Hove, part and parcel of the great town of Brighton. A new biulding scheme has been ab surdly called Tvestonville ! The origin of the name is obviously Priests' ton or habitation, and as it formerly belonged to the bishops of Chiehester, it was for distinction's sake called Pres ton Episcopi. Prestetone is assessed, in Domesday, at 20 hides, the arable, 12 plough-lands; 30 villeins with 20 bondmen had 12 ploughs. There was a church, with 15 acres of meadow and a wood of 2 hogs. The manor extends into several parishes, contiguous and remote. The descent of the manor is obscure. In 26th Henry VIII, the demesne lands were demised to Edward Elderton, gentleman. In 34th Elizabeth, Sir Thomas Shirley, of the Wiston family, became seised, and in that family it long re-"], [430, "110 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. mained. Sir Richard Shirley, Bart., who died in 1705, demised it to his three daughters and co-heiresses. Ultimately Thomas Western, who had married one of them, became sole proprietor. His grandson, Charles Cadis Western, Esq., in 1794, sold the estate for \u00a317,600, to William Stanford, Esq., in whose represen tatives it now vests. The church (St. Peter) is small, and though, as Mr. Hussey remarks, it has only chancel, nave, and smad western tower, and possesses little ornament \" it is an interesting building, being entirely in one style \u2014 the Early English, without the ad mixture of any other.\" The east end has three lancet windows within a large arch. In the north wall of the chancel is a sepulchral monument, the brasses of which are lost, with a Per pendicular altar-tomb, for one of the Shirley family, richly carved. In the south wad are a piscina, and three sedilia of different grades, all under trefoiled arches. In \" Arch\u00e6ologia,\" Vol. xxiii, the Rev. Charles Townsend describes some mural paintings in this church, which are stid visible. The principal subject is the murder of Thomas a Becket, and from the costume, &c, the date of this rude art is the time of Edward I. There are also figures of the Saviour, and several saints. In this church lie buried the remains of Francis Cheynell, D.D., the great Pres byterian controversialist, and the foe of Chillingworth ; (see \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 309), and in 'the church -yard is the tomb of the Rev. James Douglas, author of \" Nenia Britannica \" and various other works. He died in 1819, one of the ablest antiquaries of his time. [S. A. C. Shirley family, xiv, 114, 232. xix, 63, 161.

That portion which is near the church is consider-"], [431, "111 PULBOROUGH. ably elevated, and commands an excellent prospect. The ancient wooden bridge which formerly crossed the Arun, was replaced nearly eighty years since by the present structure of stone. Domesday informs us that in the time of the Confessor, fjluric held the manor, while, at the making of the Record, Robert held it of Earl Roger de Montgomeri. The land was 16 hides, and there were 35 villeins, 15 cottars, and 9 serfs. There were two churches, two mids, and two fisheries. Temp. Edward Cons, it was estimated at \u00a316; afterwards at \u00a322. With this important manor were connected those of \" Nordbome,\" and \" Nitinbreham,\" which extended into the Weald. John de Gatesden held two knights' fees in Pulberg of the Honour of Arundel. In 1290 Henry Hoese or Husse, having married Joan, daughter of Alard le Fleming, of Newbridge in Pulborough, succeeded to part of the estate, whde Walter de Lisle having married Florence, another co-heiress of Alard, obtained from the King free warren in their manor of Pulborough, with a fair to last three days at Newbridge. The Hussfe and Lisles held the manor in joint tenure till 30th Henry VI., when Edmund atte Milne or Mille succeeded to one moiety. Nicholas Apsley, of the Thakeham family, succeeded through the heiress of Mille. In 1594 Anthony Oneley possessed one third part of the manor, which passed to the Shelleys, and the last John Apsley of Pulborough sold the other two-thirds to Henry Shelley, Esq., of Lewes, about 1732, and in that family it remained until the extinction of the Lewes Shelleys a, few years since. Noedboene or Nutboene, another manor and tything, hes partly in this parish and partly in West Chiltington Two free men held it ofthe Confessor, and after the Conquest Robert held it of Earl Roger, and Warin of him. It was an important manor, as it was rated at six hides, had two mills, 20 villeins, 4 cottars, and a wood of 12 swine. It was valued at \u00a37. The family of La Zouche held it down to the year 1400. In 1545, Henry VIII. granted it to Henry, Earl of Arundel. Its 48 customary tenants now hold it under the Earl of Abergavenny. (Cartwright.) \" Nitinbreham \" was held before the Conquest by Lewin, \" who might go whither he would.\" Afterwards Roger held it of the Earl, and Alwardof him. There were 16 vdleins,3 cottars, ancl a wood for 10 swine. Pulborough formerly contained several ancient seats, the prin cipal of which Cartwright enumerates thus : \u2014 1, Mille Place, the seat of the Milles \u2014 site unknown ; 2, Combe-lands, the abode of a family of that name, who preceded Mille ; 3, Lodge Hill, in Pulborough Park, the residence of the Le Flemings,* and after- * Edward II. permitted Alard le Fleming to rebuild his house in Pulborough Park, destroyed by fire, but not to embattle it."], [432, "112 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. wards the property of the Husseys and Lisles ; 4, Old Place, which belonged successively to the Apsleys, Moses, and Cole brookes \u2014 there are some picturesque remains of this mansion ; 5, New Place, belonged successively to the Apsleys, Peacheys, and Barttelots. The barn belonging to this house has Early English windows, and is supposed to be of the time of Edward I. Pulborough is an ancient site, and many traces of Celtic and Roman possession have been brought to light. Mr. P. J. Martin, in Vol. ix. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" gives a notice of a British settlement discovered by himself on Nut bourne Common, now enclosed, about the year 1819. On an elevated part of the Common there were two depressed circular barrows, measuring respectively 80 and 90 feet, wliich, on exa mination by Messrs. Martin and Cartwright, were not found to contain any interments. There were circular depressions in the centre, and the exterior rim of the circle exhibited the peculi arity of foundations of a wall of stone four feet thick. Several relics of undoubted British manufacture were discovered ; and the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Martin is, that these barrows were the dwelling-places of human beings \u2014 perhaps the pri meval hunters, who sought their game in what must then have been a well-wooded country. Many Roman remains have been discovered here. The Stane street, which ran from Regnum, (Chiehester) to London, passes in a straight line 3\u00a3 miles through this parish, and has never ceased, since Roman times, to be the common highway. Its course through Pulborough commences at what was the old ford of the river Arun, and runs to Hadfoldsherne in the neighbouring parish of Billingshurst. There were probably several military stations on or near this via, and some indicia of considerable interest have been discovered within the present century, but before particularizing these, I should mention that there is, at no great distance from the vdlage on the west, a circular mound of earth, mostly artificial. It is surrounded by a vallation, and there are slight traces of a building. Other remains were found here, but as they have not been preserved, nothing which could indicate the date of this little fort or castellum is ascertained. As it commands the ford of the river, and a wide view of the surrounding country, it was probably a watch-tower. The late eminent West Sussex geologist, Mr. P. J. Martin, F.G.S.,* minutely examined the Stane-street in its passage through this and other parishes, and the following notes are from his paper in the \" Sussex Collections.\" At Homestreet, a short distance to tbe north of the east end of Pulborough street, are consider able indications of a remarkable township, or assemblage of * See ante."], [433, "113 PULBOROUGH. Roman buildings. The most notable of these is a circular mausoleum, situated on a slight elevation in a field called Huddlestone. The area is forty feet, and it is surrounded by a wall 11^ feet thick. Part of these walls has been grubbed up for the sake of the stones. When the plan of this mausoleum was laid bare it was declared that there were few equal to it out of Italy. At a short distance from this, atBroomer's Hill, four pigs of Roman lead were discovered just below the surface. They are stamped with the inscription icltepvtbeexaeg, which has been interpreted to mean Tiberius Claudius, Tribuniti\u00e6 Potes tatis Britanni\u00e6 Rex. Some distance to the north is Borough farm, where very extensive buildings have been traced out, with con siderable fragments of tesselated pavement and coloured stucco. Near at hand is a quarry, from which the stone of Pulborough church is said to have been taken, and from which there is little doubt the Romans drew materials for Bignor, ancl for the sar cophagi found at Avisford and elsewhere. In digging for foun dations close to the village of Pulborough, fragments of Roman tde are turned up, as also Roman coins which have passed cur rent both here and at Billingshurst as halfpence. All these discoveries tend to prove that, although not strictly a Roman station, Pulborough must have been rather thickly peopled with \" the conquerors of the world.\" The church (Our Lady of Assumption) is beautifully situated on a hill of sandstone, and has a picturesque appearance. It has an arcade with clerestory windows, forming two aisles, and these, as wed as the tower, Cartwright believes to have been built temp. Henry IV. or Henry VI. There is a square embattled tower at the west end, of the same date. The chancel is of much earlier date, being the surviving portion of the original edifice. It contains three sedilia of equal height, and two slabs of Sussex marble despoded of their brasses. The whole interior is particularly neat and appropriate. At the south-west of the church-yard there formerly stood a sepulchral chapel (Our Lady) belonging to the family of Mille. Towards the end of the last century it was taken down, when the slabs and brasses were placed in the chancel. A lych-gate has been erected at the entrance of the church-yard from the street, and has a pleasing appearance. The brasses removed from the chapel were figures of \u00a9tumml) JHillf, Gentilman, 1452, and Matilda his wife, and a plate for ISictjari) JHtUf, their son and heir, 1478. There is a beautiful brass of an ecclesiastic in the habit of a canon of Chi ehester, surmounted by a canopy for 2T1)0S. #}arlgnjjt rector of Ringwode and Polberg, 1423.

The parish is boldly undulated, and has in some places copses of underwood. It includes the conspicuous promontory called Wolstonbury, a Saxon designation signifying the \" stronghold of Wulstan.\" From this elevation not only the Weald of Sussex, but the Surrey hills, and even a portion of Kent, can be clearly seen. Pye combe is not mentioned in Domesday, but Pangdean is found under the orthography of Pinhedene. In 40th Edward III. this manor was held of tbe barony of Lewes by the service of keep ing in repair the pales of Cuckfield park. It was included in the De Warenne grant to Edward II. , yet Alice, sister of John, last Earl de Warenne, conveyed it in marriage to Edmund, Earl of Arundel, and his descendant, the Duke of Norfolk, is still lord paramount. In 1593 Sir Anthony Browne, Viscount Montague, died seised of it, and on the extinction of the male line of that family in the last century it lapsed to the Crown, and it is still held under a Crown lease. Tyecombe, which from its chalky soil and good position should"], [435, "PYECOMBE. RACTON. 115 be a very healthy spot, has at different periods suffered severely from pestilence. It was visited by the plague in 1603, 1638, and 1678, and in the last great visitation of cholera several of the inhabitants died. The church is a small ancient building of chancel, nave, and small low tile-capped tower at the west end. Its single bed is inscribed to St. Katherine. Hussey thinks the tower of Tran sition-Norman date, and the font is very curious and ancient, perhaps pre-Norman. The building has been much disguised by id-applied \" restorations.\" There are memorials for the names and families of Scrase (seventeenth century) and Barrett, Bysshe, and Beaumont (rectors). Sir Lewis Beaumont, Bart., was rector from 1702 to 1738. There are also two coffin-shaped slabs with crosses for earlier rectors. In the church-yard is a rudely con structed altar-tomb, with the date 1603. It is traditionally said to be to the memory of Mr. Hollingdale, tenant of Pangdean Farm. During the prevalence of the plague he betook himself to a cave, which he had excavated in the Way Down, a mile distant, but returning too soon to his home he took the infec tion, died, and was buried under this memorial.

The soil is that of the South Downs, chalk and marl. It is supposed to derive its name from Racon, a little \" lavant,\" or intermittent stream, which flows through it. The village is unimportant. Fulco held the manor of the Confessor, and Ivo of Earl Roger. It was rated at five hides, and had eight villeins with 13 bondmen, and a wood of four hogs. Its Domesday value was \u00a34. In 1284 Hugh Zan zaver was lord, and in the sixteenth century it came into the possession of the family of Gounter, or Gunter, from Gideston, in Wales. It passed from that family in 1754, by an heiress, to William Legge, second Earl of Dartmouth. i 2"], [436, "116 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Loedington, the Hurditone of Domesday, is an ancient hamlet and chapelry in this parish. It is described as in the hundred of Guidenetroi, was rated at four hides, and had eight villeins, seven bordars, and a wood of three hogs. After the Conquest it was granted to Earl Roger de Montgomeri, and one ofthe two knights' fees passed in succession through the families of De Albini, Tatteshale, Romaine, De Lisle, and Bramshott. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, Lordington became the pro perty of Sir Richard Pole, K.G., a cousin of Henry VII., who is supposed to have built Lordington House. The mansion was reconstructed on the old site in the seventeenth century, and retains some of the original features, particularly an ancient staircase. From the illustrious and historical house of Pole it passed in succession to the families of Lumley, Jermyn, Peck ham, and Phipps. The church contains a mural monument to a member of the Gunter family, who, with his wife and four sons and two daughters, are represented in a kneeling posture, St. John the Baptist standing in the centre. There is another monument to the Gunter famdy, with two kneeling figures, and a third has a bust of Sir Charles Gunter Nichol, K.B. Several slabs in the Gunter chapel are to the memory of members of the same family. There are two bells. Racton was the residence of Colonel George Gunter, a faithful adherent to the cause of Charles II. , who had the honour, after the battle of Worcester, of conducting the King across the country to Brighthelmston, whence the latter escaped safely to Fecamp, in Normandy.

Alexander, Esq.; Wellingham, Miss Eickman. The hundred to which this parish gives name is one of the"], [437, "117 RINGMER. oldest on record in the county, being mentioned in very early documents of Saxon times. About the time of King John, when the College of South Mailing was remodelled, the manor was divided into three beadlewicks, viz., Ranscombe, Framfield, and Ringmer, and these beadlewicks, in the time of Henry VIII., became distinct manors. In 3rd James I. the manor of Ring mer (Broyle Park excepted) was granted by the King to Edward, Earl of Worcester, and Sir Robert Johnson, by whom it was sold to Sir John Sidley and Sir George Rivers for \u00a38,440. The same year it was sold for a similar sum to Thomas, Earl of Dor set, in whose heirs it still vests. Broyle Park, deriving its name from the low Latin bruillium, a heathy plain, was long a park belonging to the Archbishops of Canterbury, who had a mansio or resting-place here when on their pastoral visits into Sussex. It was of great extent, pro bably of 2,000 acres, about 500 of wliich were in Framfield parish, and had a splendid herd of deer. Temp. Elizabeth it was taken possession of by the Crown. At a later date the Broyle was in the hands of the family of Springett, who dwelt at Broyle Place from the earlier part of the seventeenth century, and were afterwards baronets. Sir William Springett took an active part in the Civil Wars on the side of the Parliament, and was in command at Arundel in 1643, where he died. For a most interesting account of his death, written by his wife, see \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" vol. xx, p. 34. Broyle Place was a large rambling mansion of many gables, but it is now shorn down to the proportions of a farm house. The park has long been converted into arable land, and no traces of its timber and underwood remain. Near its ancient pale is a wayside inn, called the \" Green Man,\" which was kept about a century since by a person who had been a parker, and the sign, which I re member, represented a stalwart man in his forester's suit of green. The Broyle is now a favourite spot for steeple chases, which are held annually. The surface of the parish of Bingmer is remarkably flat and unpicturesque, although the village itself is neat and interesting, surrounding an open space called Ring mer Green. Close adjoining is an old residence known as Delves House, which was, in the last century, a favourite resort of Gilbert White of Selborne, from whence he dated many of the letters of his charming book. The old pine grove, whither cross bills and others of the feathered nation did resort, still exists near the church yard. The soil of the parish, especially on the Broyle, is gault \u2014 excellent for the brickmaker \u2014 and it is worth notice that specimens of copper ore have been dug up here. This is \" not geologically right,\" but it is true, as I can prove.* * I am also prepared to prove that rich copper ore has been found in a clutlk cutting close to Lewes. Impossible, says Geology : truth, say I."], [438, "118 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. The roads in this parish were formerly so intolerably bad that it is said that the Springetts of Broyle Place were formerly drawn to church in their carriage by a team of eight oxen. There were formerly artillery barracks in this parish. Ringmer Park, now disparked, was, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the seat of the family of Thatcher, who intermarried with the Challenors, Lewknors, Pelhams, Gages, &c, and were afterwards of Priest hawes, in Westham. The church (St. Mary) consists of chancel, nave, north and south aisles, with a modern wooden bed-turret over the west end. On each side of the chancel there is a manorial chapel, the appropriaton of which I cannot discover \u2014 probably the Broyle, and Ringmer park. Each contains a piscina. The pre vailing style is Perpendicular. This church is very rich in mor tuary memorials for the names and families of Springett, Whal ley, Campion, Wynne, Tyro (a painfull preacher), Sadler, Snooke (second daughter of Rev. Gilbert White, of Selborne), whose husband Henry, \" post vitam difficilem hie quiescit,\" Shadwell, Plumer, Jefferay, Crunden, Howell, and Elliott.

This is a flat alluvial parish near a branch of the Ouse and probably received its name from its being on the ripa or"], [439, "RIPE OR RIPE. 119 bank of a river, once much more important than now, when the Ouse was a great estuary. There is a strong mineral spring in the parish called the Red ditch. There is a tradition of a vil lage near the south-west boundary. Iii the Domesday survey Rype is mentioned as being in Edluestone hundred, which partly coincided with the modern hundred of Shiplake. Before that time it was one of the very numerous manors held by Harold, and was assessed at 23 hides, 8 of which were detached, and lay iu the rape of Hastings. There were 10 plough-lands, 16 villeins, and 8 bondmen, with 8 salt-pans. Temp. Confos soris it was worth \u00a312, afterwards only \u00a38. After many changes of possession the manor came into the possession of Reginald West, Lord de la Warr, of whom a memorial stid exists in the window of a smad house in the parish, in the shape of the \" chape \" of a sword\u2014 a badge won at Poictiers, for the capture, under the Black Prince, of King John of France. Temp. Philip and Mary, the Earl of Rutland sold the manor to Sir John Gage. The rectory anciently belonged to Lewes Priory. The church (St. John the Baptist) is a remarkably good and symmetrical building of no great size, and principally in the Decorated style. It consists of nave and chancel, with a square western tower, over the west door of which is the badge of the Pelham Buckle, so familiar in this district. The windows \u2014 the eastern one is particularly handsome \u2014 were formerly fided with painted glass ; and emblems of the Evangelists, or portions of them, still exist. There are inscriptions to the names of Williamson, Acton, and Plumer. The famdy of Acton were resident here for at least three centuries ; and at Hall Court the family of Lulham were very ancient. In close proximity to the modern residence are traces of the ancient abode of the Lulham family. At Mark- Cross in this parish, in the direction of Laughton, formerly stood a wayside cross dedicated to St. Mark, and in the latter parish, at a spot not far distant, was another called Stone Cross. Opposed to the theory of geologists that copper ore should not appear in any stratum of this county, that metal has been found in the gault formation on Mr. Weeden's land, as also in the neighbouring parish of Ringmer, and I have even found it in the chalk formation close to Lewes.

A hamlet and small town in Salehurst, containing a large proportion of the population of that parish. It formerly pos sessed a chapel, dedicated to St. Catharine, and a holy well under the same invocation. In the old \" coaching\" times, this town was wed known to travellers. At present it contains little of interest, except the ruins of its ancient Abbey, which lie some what to the east. From the fact that Robertsbridge stands on the river Rother, here crossed by several bridges, it has been erroneously conjec tured that the original name of the place was Rotherbridge. But the real etymology is Pons Roberti, \" the bridge of Robert\" (de St. Martin), the founder ofthe Abbey. The history of this establishment has been well investigated by the Rev. George Miles Cooper, M.A., assisted by the previous researches of the Rev. E. Venables, M.A., and by a remarkable discovery at Penshurst Castle (the seat of Lord de Lisle,) of nearly 200 documents relating to the monastery, by the Rev. G. R. Bossier. (\" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" Vol. viii.) The manner in which his lordship acquired them will be found in the sequel. The Abbey was of the Cistercian order, and dedicated to St. Mary. There is little doubt that Robert de St. Martin was the founder in 1176, though that honour has been claimed for his descendant, Alured de St. Martin, who, with the benefactions of Alicia his wife, seems to have so enlarged the establishment as to have become the reputed founder. Certain it is that the earliest seal of the house hitherto discovered has the legend, \"de Ponte Roberti-\" and it is worth noting that the counter-seal contains a representation of the Abbey-church, with a bridge of three arches close by. The original endowment consisted of ad the lands, tenements, tenants, and services, which the founder held of Geoffry de St. Martin and his heirs in the Rape of Hastings. Subsequent benefactors gave, or the monks themselves purchased, other manors and lands in the adjacent parishes of Pett, Guestling, Icklesham, Playden, and Iden. One of the earliest benefactors was Alicia, Countess of Eu, daughter of Adehza, Queen of Henry I. Other members of this noble family conferred lands in Snar gate, Worth, and Coombden, adjoining the Forest of Brightling, Sedlescombe, and Ewhurst, together with a prebend in the church of St. Mary of Hastings. Other lands were subsequently acquired in Fairlight, Promhill, Catsfield, Dallington, Burwash, Ivychurch, Echingham, Sutton (now in Seaford), Hellingly, Chid dingly, Waldron, Beckl0, Mountfield, Bexhill, and many other places. Among the benefactors, besides the De St. Martins and the Earls of Eu, were the families of St. Leger, De Socknerse"], [441, "121 ROBERTSBRIDGE (in Brightling \u2014 a branch of the St. Legers), Lunsford, De Pos singworth, De Herst, De Scotney, Alard, and De Abrincis. The multitudinous deeds, &c, above referred to, contain records of many law-suits in which the convent was concerned during several centuries. The rights of the monks as to lands were much infringed by neighbours with whose interests those of the former clashed. Even (as Mr. Cooper thinks) their very books were not safe, as there is in the Bodleian Library a MS. bearing this inscription : \u2014 \" This book belongs to St. Mary of Robertsbridge : whosoever shall steal it, or sell it, or in any way alienate it from this house, let him be anathema in aranatha\" John, Bishop of Exeter, into whose hands the book fell, asserts that he acquired it in a lawful way, and states that he does not know \" where the aforesaid house is !\" For further interesting particulars respecting the Abbey I must refer to Mr. Cooper's elaborate paper ; but one or two facts deserve sjtecial mention. Kings Edward I. and II. paid hasty visits to this monastery in their journeys in the South. In 1192, when it was understood that Richard C\u0153ur de Lion had been imprisoned on his return from Palestine, the Abbots of Robertsbridge and Boxley were sent as lords-justices to ascer tain the place of his detention. They travelled over great part of Germany, and at last found him at large at Oxfer, in Bavaria. This foundation suffered the common fate of religious houses in 30th Henry VIII., when its revenues amounted to more than \u00a3270 \u2014 a large sum at the period, and probably representing about \u00a32,600 at the present value of money. Two years later the site was granted to Sir Wdliam Sydney.* His successor, Sir Henry Sydney, Knight of the Garter, and Lord-Deputy of Ireland, was father of Sir Philip Sydney, the illustrious soldier and scholar, author of the \" Arcadia,\" and of Mary, who mar ried Henry, Earl of Pembroke, the eminent lady immortalized in the noble epitaph of Ben. Jonson, which cannot be too often quoted : \u2014 \"Underneath this marble hearse, Lies the subject of all verse ; Sydney's sister, Pembroke's mother ; Death 1 'ere thou hast slain another Learned and fair, and good as she, Time shall throw a dart at thee.\" I have in my possession a MS. entitled \" Rental of Lands, appointed for the jointure of Mary, Countess of Pembroke, wife of Henry, Earl of Pembroke, and daughter of the Right Honour able Sir Henry Sydney, Knight of the Garter,\" &c. These * Tanner (Z7, titia) says that at the Dissolution the convent consisted of twelve monks ; other authorities say that there were but nine, including the Abbot."], [442, "122 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. lands are mostly in the west of England, and in Wales ; but as the MS. is bound up as the prefix of a much larger rental re lating to . Robertsbridge and other places in Sussex, Kent, and Hampshire, I conceive that a portion, at least, of the possessions of our abbey, became the property of the learned and beautiful lady aforesaid. They were possessed by the Sydneys, Earls of Leicester, until 1720, and in 1725 the property passed by pur chase to Sir Thomas Webster, of Battle Abbey, at the cost of \u00a328,000. At a later period it belonged to the family of Allfrey; but of the exact descent I have no particulars. Of the few remains of this ancient Abbey, as now existing, the principal architectural features are the crumbling walls of the church in the farm-yard, and a kind of cottage farm-house, beneath wliich is a crypt in good preservation, and a portion of the refectory. In the church some members of the ancient families of De Bodiam, Dalyngruge, Pelham, and others had sepulture under stately tombs ; but these, alas ! have disappeared. The utilitarian age which succeeded the Reformation consigned them to viler uses, and the few relics which survive to our age are but the meagre debris of good medieval art. The mutilated effigy of the once potent founder of Bodiam Castle, Sir Edward Dalyngruge, dug up in 1823, is now in the Museum at Lewes Castle. When, about the year 1830, I first visited this venerable site, I found, and preserved sketches of, several mutilated carved stones, with crosses, &c, together with an inscription to Wil liam Bodiam, of very early date, probably of the 13th century; the arms and \" buckle \" of the family of Pelham, and several other heraldric remains. On my next visit, a few years later, I found that most of these had been broken up for the mending of neighbouring roads 1 The Robertsbridge estate during the proprietorship of the Sydneys possessed several iron and steel works ; and furnace ponds and forge ponds are mentioned in the MS. above referred to.

Peter de Putron, M.A., of Pembroke College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1704. Acreage, 1,924. Chief Landowner, the Earl of Abergavenny, who possesses nearly the entire parish. The first syllable was formerly spelt Had, and doubtless had reference to tbe military road, \" Ermin-street,\" which passed through it. Domesday informs us that Harold held the manor, and that after the Conquest Widiam de Warenne had it in domain, and was assessed for 64 hides. There were a church, 11 salt-pans (probably on the estuary of the Ouse), and a wood of 23 hogs. Forty-four houses in Lewes belonged to the manor, \u2022which extended much beyond the boundaries of the modern parish. It was granted by John de Warenne to Edward II. , and subsequently belonged to a famdy who caded themselves from it, De Radmeld. Sir Ralph Radmeld married, early in the fif- teenth century, Margaret, co-heiress of her brother Hugh, second Lord Camoys, of Broadwater. His grandson, Sir William Rad- myld, died without issue, when the property reverted to his two aunts, Elizabeth and Margaret. The latter married John Goring. Esq., of Burton, who died in 1495. After nine gener- ations this, the elder line of Goring, terminated in Anne Goring, who married Richard Biddulph, Esq., of Biddulph Castle, co. Stafford, whose elder line became extinct by tbe death of John Biddulph, Esq., of Burton, in 1835. On his decease Thomas Stonor, Esq., of Stonor, co. Oxon, claimed as the heir of his great grandmother, Mary Biddulph, the barony of Camoys, which he obtained in 1839, after it had been in abeyance 413 years. In 27th Henry VIII. George, Lord Abergavenny, died possessed of Rodmell, which still belongs to his descendant, the Earl of Abergavenny. Northease, another manor, also belonged to the De Warennes, and has, probably in the same line, passed like Rodmed to the Earl of Abergavenny. It had a chapel of chancel and nave, 55 feet in length, some of the masonry of which, with mural paintings and carved oak, remained in the early part of the last century. The ancient lords of Rodmell had a park, of which the name now only exists. Hall Place, or Rodmell Place, was bought, in 1586, of Edward Deeds by John de la Chambre, Esq., of the Litlington fandly, whose descendants were in possession in 1690. The house, which had traces of considerable magnificence, was probably built by John de la Chambre, whose arms were to be seen before its demolition, some 30 years since, over the entrance of the porch. It after wards passed to the families of Montague and Togbill, and of the latter it was purchased by the Saxbys, who resold it to the Earl of Abergavenny."], [444, "124 HISTORY OF SUSSEX On a beautiful slope of the Downs, southward of the vdlage, are evident traces of a pre-historic hamlet or vdlage of some kind, with several small barrows. The church (St. Peter) is a small building, of chancel, nave, with south aisle, west tower, and quadrangular shingled spire. On the south side of the high chancel is another, which was formerly attached to the manor of Rodmell. The building has Transition-Norman features, especially in its \" diamond frette\" chancel arch, and in a curious hagioscope. Additions have been made in the Early English and Perpendicular styles, and the whole building has been restored by the present Rector. There are memorials for individuals ofthe families of Scottowe, Grundy, Griffiths, Gabbitas (rectors), Alchorne, Montague, &c. There is also a brass plate for a benefactress to the church, .Egatfja tStokf, wife of John Broke, and daughter of John de Rade melde, date 1433.

Acreage, 4,873. Seats, Eogate Lodge, Mrs. Wyndham ; Fairoak, Hon. J. Jervis Carnegie ; and Fyning House, J. W. Whitelock, Esq. This parish, which joins Hampshire on the west, lies on the Western Rother, which is crossed by Habenbridge, a structure of five arches. It is full of varied and picturesque scenery of almost every kind, particularly the spot called Harting Combe, the western termination of the Weald, behind which the chalk hills of Surrey meet the western range of the South Downs, and form a kind of amphitheatre of wonderful beauty. Rogate, at the time of the Domesday survey, was part of the great lord ship of Harting, and it is probable that a fourth hamlet or parish"], [445, "125 ROTHERFIELD. formerly existed here, called North Harting, in contradistinction to South, East, and West Harting. This idea is supported by the tradition that a church formerly stood here. Temp. Edward II. the manor belonged to the great family of Camoys, from whom it descended to the Radmylds, and to the Lewknors. Henry VEIL granted it to William, Earl of Southampton. After many changes it came, in the earlier part of the present century, to Lewis Buckle, Esq., of the Westmorland family. Fyning was possessed in the 16th century by Peter Bettesworth, and re mained with his descendants for six generations, who also held Midand in Trotton, and Chithurst. On an eminence above the Rother are some vestiges of a fortified residence within a fosse, but of its origin nothing seems to be known. At Rake, in this parish, budt into the front of a small house, is a large armorial stone, with the shield and supporters of the Lords Grey of Werke, which was brought from Uj)-park. The church (St. Bartholomew) is small and ancient, with traces of Norman work. John Bonville of Halnaker, 9th Henry VII., gave to the Brotherhood of St. Katherine and St. Blaise in this church, 13s. 4d., to buy two kine to secure the prayers of the guild for ever. In this parish is Dueefoed Abbey, an account of which is given in another article. [S. A. C. Church, xii, 76. Ancient Brotherhood, xv, 61. Bells, xvi, 221. Biver Bother, xvi, 259. Bogate, xviii, 94.

Acreage, 14,733. Chief Landowners, Earl of Abergavenny, E. B. Fry, Esq., J. Scott, Esq., and the Goldsmiths' Company of London. This very extensive and important parish, historically and picturesquely interesting, respectively to the arch\u00e6ologist and the artist, occupies an elevated district, Crowborough, within its limits, being one of the loftiest spots in the county, and possess ing some historical associations. (See Ceowboeough.) In Saxon times it was known as Ritheramfeld and Redrefelcl, from the circumstance that the river Rother rises here. Rotherfield is, perhaps, the principal watershed in this part of England, for,"], [446, "126 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. from a commanding spot, it sends its waters to three rivers, the Rother, debouching at Rye ; the Ouse, which has its outlet at Newhaven ; and the Medway, which, joining the Thames, flows into tbe German Ocean. The first-named river rises in the cellar of the residence called Rother-House. When the Ouse joined the English Channel at Seaford, before the formation of the \" New-Haven \" at the village previously known as Meeching, that river bore the alias of Saforda, and Rotherfield, although contributing only a small stream to it, is described as \" upon the river Saforda\" ( Super fluvium Saforda) in very early documents. Riderfeld was at an early period the possession of a Saxon Dux, or chieftain, called Bertoaldus, who falling sick, and being in curable by neighbouring physicians, went to the great monastery of St. Denis and St. Elutherius, near Paris, whose bones were working mighty marvels for diseased persons. Here being fully restored to health, he procured a few of their holy relics, brought them to Rotherfield and dedicated a church to St. Denis, in 792, which dedication still remains, and the older inhabitants of Rotherfield remember the legend of their patron : \u2014 \u25a0 \" Saint Denis had his head cut off ; He did not care for that ; He took it up and carried it Two miles without a hat 1\" Among the \" folk-lore \" of the district is the notion that the women of this parish, being often taller than those of the neigh bourhood, possess an additional pair of ribs ! Such witticisms abound in this part of Sussex, but to return to sober history, the vill of Ritherhamfeld was bequeathed by King Alfred to his kinsman Osforth. The next mention we have of it is in Domesday, where we learn that Earl Godwin was lord, and that it was taxed for only three hides, the remainder having probably been (as it long afterwards was) in the condition of unprofitable forest land. There were, however, 26 ploughlands, and in de mesne four more, with i4 villeins, with 6 borderers owning 14 ploughs. There were a park (See Frant), and a wood of 40 hogs. In the time of Edward the Confessor it was worth \u00a316, but afterwise realized \u00a330. From 18th Edward 1. to 8th Edward II. the manor was held by the noble family of De Clare. After wards it was in the possession ofthe Le Despencers, from whom it passed to the Beauchamps, Earls of Warwick, and so to the Nevides, with whom it has remained, in the same line as Eridge, the Eari of Abergavenny being the present lord. Rotherfield rectory is another manor, and is sometimes called Dowlands.* * William Dowland, several centuries since, is said to have endowed the church with this manor, the demesne of -which was 306 acres. Tbe glebe is now estimated at 110 acres, but tbe rector is charged with \u00a3100 per annum for the newly-fomied district of Eridge-Green."], [447, "ROTHERFIELD. 127 Alchorne, a third manor, gave name to a famdy, formerly of considerable importance in Sussex. They resided at Rotherfield temp. King John, and their descendants, now chiefly in humble life, are still numerous in the county, under the name of AWcom and Allckin ! The heraldic visitation of 1634 mentions the exis tence of the ancient coat of the Alchornes in the church. A gentle family named Luck were connected with the parish during the 16th and two following centuries. The family of Fermor, originally from Picardy, in the reign of Edward III., were among the principal inhabitants, and dwelt at Welches or Walshes for more than two hundred years. The manor derived its name from the family of Walsh, who were afterwards of Horeham in Waldron. The original house was on a different site from the present, and a moated enclosure remains. The present house was built by Alexander Fermor, and Elizabeth Fowle, his wife, in the 16th century. Over the hall door, when I last visited it, were their initials, Ax. F. and E. F., with the date 1551. The names of Luck and Fowle are still existing in East Sussex, but in a lower social position. For the Fermors, Baro nets, see art. Ceowboeough. Walshes was some time in the family of Moon, and Mr. Robert Burgess Fry was lately pro prietor. Mr. Fry had a minor manor within the precincts of Ashdown Forest, or Lancaster Great Park, which he held of the Duchy of Lancaster by fealty, and the payment of two roses, emblematical, perhaps, of the Lancastrian badge. A few years since, and perhaps still, the representative of the Duchy made a periodical visit to the old farm or manor-house, and snipped off two roses from a tree in front of the building, which he put into a button-hole of his coat, and walked away. The history of Rotherfield church is interesting : it dates, as we have seen, from a. d. 792. When the Dux Bertoald founded it, he made a charter (see Monasticon) describing it as \" the church which I have constructed on my estate in the vid called Ridrefelda, which I have inherited from my ancestors ;\" and he adds that, if any one shall attempt to seize, diminish, or usurp, anything from the monks (of St. Denis) he will have to answer to Almighty God, the King of Ages, when He shall come in His majesty and that of His holy angels, and when the wicked will go into everlasting punishment, &c. From the Monasticon (vi, 1053) it appears that the French monks founded a small convent as a cell to their house in connection with this church, or rather with Frant, which was then dependent on the mother church of Rotherfield. (Hussey's \" Churches,\" 276.) This establishment, however, appears to have been of no importance, and, apparently, it did not survive the Norman Conquest ; for either temp.

The present building, occupying a commanding beight, is a beautiful object in the scenery of the district. It has, what is very unusual in Sussex, an embattled tower sur mounted by a shingled spire, which is light and of elegant pro portions. It is of rather large size, with Early English and later features, and contains five bells, the tenor of which is sup posed to weigh 36 cwt. ; two of the others have inscriptions in Old English characters. There are memorials to the names of Fowle, Threele, Vintner, Luxford, Wickham, Fermor, &c. The chancel contains sedilia and a piscina, ancl on the north side of it is a chapel which formerly belonged to the noble family of Nevdle, with their arms and cognizances. The walls were an ciently painted, and a representation of the martyrdom of St. Lawrence is now visible. There are interesting churchwardens' accounts dating from the reign of Henry VIII. [S. A. C.

The parish lies entirely upon the South Downs, and has a cliff frontage on the English Channel. It takes its final syl lable from one of the numerous denes or valleys, wliich afford so graceful a variety to the Downs. The village is in the dene, and contains several agreeable residences. Many sea-side visi tors frequent it in summer. The sea encroaches considerably, and within the memory of man it has been necessary to form three roads in the direction of Brighton, each previous one having given way to these incursions of the ocean. An indent or \" gap,\" in the cliff which terminates the dene, once afforded the French facilities for landing here. This was in 1377, and Capgrave, the old chronicler, gives tbe fodowing account of the event : \u2014 \" In"], [449, "129 ROTTINGDEAN. the same yere they londed in Southsex fast by a town cleped Rotyngdene, and ageyn him went the Prior of Lewes (John de Cherlieu), and there he was taken, and with him two knytes, Sir Jon Fallisle (Fawseley of Hamsey), and Sir Thomas Cheyne, and a sqwyere, Jon Brocas (of Sherrington).\" This little battle, which Lord Berners calls \" a sore scrimysshe,\" took place on the Downs in the direction of Lewes, that town being the object which the invaders had in view. A hundred Englishmen lost their lives, but the vigorous efforts of the Lewes army repulsed the Frenchmen, who gained no other booty than the Prior, the two knights, and the squire, from whom however they probably extorted heavy ransoms. At the epoch of Domesday, Rottingdean was held by one Hugh of William de Warenne ; it had previously been in the possession of Earl Godwin. The manor was included in the great grant of the Earl of Warenne to Edward II. Since 1738 it has belonged to the Earls of Abergavenny. Balsdean, another manor, was part of the estates of Lewes Priory. In 1st of Eliza beth Thomas Gratwicke was lord, and it was subsequently in the hands of the Shirleys and Burrells : it now belongs to the Beard family. This family is one ofthe oldest in the South Down district, and the name has been associated with Rotting dean for some centuries. The old manorial chapel of Balsdean has long been desecrated, and is now used as a stable. It has slight Norman and Decorated features. Pebbles of chalcedony and agate from the sea shore of this parish are turned to account by the lapidary. The church (St. Margaret), though Early English, seems to stand on Norman foundations. At present the building consists of nave, chancel, and central tower with pyramidal cap, and a south aisle, lately rebuilt; the church was restored in 1855. There are memorials for the names of Beard, Pelling, Savage, &c. A mural monument commemorates the Rev. Thomas Red man Hooker, D.D., who was vicar here for many years, and pre pared for the Universities many young men, who became in the lapse of time eminent for their learning and abilities. Among them may be named the late Duke of Wedington and Archbishop Manmng. [S. A. C. Enamelled copper found at, v, 105. Church, ix, 67. Pendrell of, x, 189. French invasion, xii, 42. xiii, 233.

The name of this considerable parish, as Dallaway observes, is taken from the elevated position of its village, the Anglo- Saxon Rig-wic. The subsoil is sandstone, and in some parts there are beds of Horsham stone. The parish includes a con siderable amount of woodland. The vdlage stands upon a pleasant eminence with an extensive prospect. Several houses near the churchyard are within the manor of Polingfold, in Ewhurst, Surrey. (DaUaway.) The manor of Dedisham, in Slinfold, extends over a large part of the parish. Belonging to this manorial estate there was anciently a large iron foundry (with a hammer-pond), which according to tradition was de stroyed after the taking of Arundel Castle by Sir William Waller, who dispatched a party of soldiers for that purpose, when the iron-master and several others were killed. (Dallaway.) A similar destruction of iron-works by Wader's troops is said to have taken place in St. Leonard's Forest. The manor of Hope, which included the estates of Ockenden and Howick, was granted by Henry VTII. to the family of Caryll, and passed through the families of Shelley and Goring to the present owner. King Henry III., in the 44th year of his reign, granted a charter to Alard le Fleming to bold a fair in Rudgewick on the eve, feast, and morrow of the Holy Trinity, to whom the church is dedicated. The principal estate in Rudgewick was for many generations possessed by the old Sussex family of Naldrett, and is called Naldrett Place. The estate ultimately descended, in the last century, after several lawsuits, to the family of Piggott. The church was in ancient times endowed with 63 acres of arable and woodland, and the impropriator has an ecclesiastical manor. In the fifteenth century Edmund Mdle, Esq., founded a chantry of St. Christopher, called for some reason the Salmon Chantry, in Arundel Church, the revenues of which were prin cipally derived from this impropriation. The following is the description given of the church of Rudgewick in 1832 : \u2014 \" The church is situated upon the ridge, and is of a better construction than most others in this division of the county. It consists of"], [451, "131 ROUGHEY. RUMBOLDSWYKE. a nave, divided from a north aisle by a pointed arcade, with labelled windows, in which remains of richly stained glass are still seen.

It was part of the earldom of Roger de Montgomeri, and passed to the De Albini family, and from them to the Fitz-Alans. In much later times John, Lord Lumley, possessed it, and it passed, as Stanstead, to Lewis Way, Esq. Another manor was held by the Knights-Hospi- tallers. Henry VIII. granted this to Sir Thomas White. In 23rd Elizabeth, Francis Bowyer held it of the Crown, and since that date it has belonged successively to Cawley, Farrington, Barwell, Dally, and Padwick. The church is said to be dedicated to St. Rumbold, and there are two Rumwolds in the Roman calendar ; but I think this ascription rests only upon a presumption founded on the name ofthe parish. Rumbold is much likelier to have been the Saxon proprietor than the patron saint. The building is smad, consist ing of chancel and nave, with bell-turret at the west end. This church is one of the Dean's Peculiars. In 1866 the building was enlarged by the addition of an aisle ; and during the re pairs traces of Roman tdes, probably from Regnum (Chiehester), and herringbone work, were disclosed. The original church was in ad probability pre-Norman. [S. A. C. Bell, xvi, 222. Boman urns found at, xvii, 255. Knights Hospitallers' lands, xx, 27.] k 2"], [452, "132 HISTORY OF SUSSEX.

Gossett Hill, Esq. This is a well-wooded parish on the Forest Ridge, the village street forming the watershed of tributaries of the Mole and the Arun. The farms are small, and some of the yeomanry are of considerable antiquity. According to tradition the family of Mutton have possessed the lands called Normans from the Con quest. A gentry family named Gardiner resided here in the 16th and 17th centuries. Lands bearing their name now belong to what is called Dog Smith's charity. A Nunneet dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene existed in this parish. It was founded in or before the 12th century, as Mr. Way supposes, by one of the De Braose family, among whose vast possessions Rusper was included. It was of the Benedictine rule, and the constituents were called Moniales Nigrae. Seffrid IL, Bishop of Chiehester (1180-1204), confirmed to the sisterhood the churches of Rusper, Warnham, Ifield, and Selham. About 1231, John de Braose augmented the possessions by the gift of the church of Horsham. No other endowments appear to have been made, and the establishment fell into poverty and decay. In 1484 it is described as in a state of ruin, though this was not literally the case, as the revenues amounted at the Dissolution in 1535 to \u00a339 14s. 6d. What remained of the conventual buildings was soon after destroyed. Queen Elizabeth granted the site to John Cowper, and it was subsequently the property of a family of Stone, one of whom in 1717 sold it to Sir Isaac Shard, a person so proverbially avaricious, that Hogarth introduced his portrait into his picture, \" The Miser's Feast.\" His son, ayoung man of sj}irit, called on the painter, and drawing his sword cut a hole in the canvas. \" Nunnery \" was held by this family until Widiam Shard, Esq., aliened it in 1791. After passing through several hands it was purchased by Thomas Sanctuary, Esq., High Sheriff, in 1 830. Many interesting documents relating to"], [453, "133 RUNTINGTON. RUSTINGTON. this establishment have been printed by Mr. Way, S. A. C, Vol. v. The house built on the site of the Nunnery was a timbered structure, and a view of it, by Grimm, is given in S. A. C. v., 250. The present house is modern. In 1840 a beautiful enamelled chalice ofthe 12th or 13th century was discovered with human remains, presumed to be those of a Prioress, within the ambit of the Nunnery. In 1450 the commons of Rowesparre, under Thomas Walter, and John Styles, and Thomas Bartelot, \"gentilmen,\" rose in favour of Jack Cade. The church (St. Mary), principally ofthe 14th century, consists of nave, aisles, chancel, and massive embattled tower. The body ofthe edifice was rebuilt in 1855, at the expense ofthe Broad wood family.

It is a fertile agricultural parish, and contains several ex cellent private residences. The manor is mentioned in Domes day under (West) Prestetune.

Barfords, and Cookes, down to about the beginning of the 16th century, and was divided into Eastcourt and Westcourt. After a great variety of changes of ownership it became the property of Charles, Duke of Norfolk, who in 1790 sold it to William Gratwicke, Esq., of Ham, in whose representatives it still vests. Prestetune itself belonged, before the Conquest, to a freewoman named Ulveva. It was subsequently held by Bohun, Tregoz, Lewknor, and Dawtrey, and in 1560 Thomas Baker, the maternal grandfather of the illustrious John Selden, was possessor. Later proprietors have been Alderton, Willes, Dawtrey, and Bushby of Arundel. Another estate passed through the famdies of Upperton, Barwick, Gratwicke, and Campion, and was purchased in 1810 by E. G. Penfold, Esq.

Eye is in many respects one of the most interesting towns in East Sussex. The name is probably derived from the old Norman rive, Latin ripa, a bank, which wed describes its geo graphical character. It is near the eastern extremity of Sussex, and its situation near the mouth of the Eastern Rother has always given it some degree of commercial importance. It was not originally one'of the Cinque-Ports, but in the early Norman"], [455, "135 RYE period it was added, with its sister-town of Winchelsea, to that ancient league, the two being designated \"nobiliora membra Quinque Portuum,\" and ranking next in order to the five original ports. In every other respect it has for centuries been regarded as equal to the original five ports. As an actual port for com- merce it is the best of the series, most of which, be it said, are no longer ports at all. Some topographers have, without foun- dation, made it the Portus Novus of Ptolemy. The position of the town is somewhat grand and romantic, and from some points of view its fine old church becomes a kind of Acropolis. On entering Rye, the visitor is struck with its medieval appearance ; narrow streets, paved with smad boulders like \" petrified kid- neys-,\" and antique gabled houses being its chief characteristics. That it was originally insulated appears pretty clear, as the surrounding aduvial soil must have been deposited by salt and fresh water. Of the antiquity of the town we can only guess from inferences, but as it was seated on the Rother, more anciently known as the Limene, and having its outfad much farther to the east, in the neighbourhood of Hythe in Kent, it must have been of some importance for shipmen as early at least as the time of the first Norsemen and Danes. We are told in the Saxon Chronicle, under the year 893, that 250 Danish ships entered the Limene, and in the year 1822 a discovery was made at Northiam, at a place not far from the present navigable river Rother, which helps to illustrate this point. A ship, pre- sumed to have been one of this fleet, was discovered deeply imbedded in ten feet of mud and sand. She was 65 feet long and 14 feet wide, with cabin and forecastle, and on board of her were found a human skud, a pair of goat's horns, a poinard, the bricks of a fire-hearth, several square ornamental glazed tiles, some pottery, several pairs of shoes or sandals, and many other relics. For speculations on the ancient condition of Rye and its port, see Dugdale's \" History of Imbanking,\" and the late Mr. Wdliam Holloway's \" History of Rye.\" The hun- dred or manor of winch the town formed part, is caded in Domesday Staneings, and like Winchelsea and several other places in Sussex, was given by the Confessor to the Norman abbey of Fecamp, and so continued till 1267, when Henry III. resumed possession, giving the monks in exchange the manor of Cheltenham in the county of Gloucester, and other lands. Rye, like most of our southern ports, has been bonoured by several royal visits. King John was there ; so were Edward III., Henry VII., Henry VIII., and Elizabeth. The virgin queen was re- ceived with so much loyalty that she called the town \"Rye Royal,\" on the same occasion that she re-christened Winchelsea as \" Little London.\" This was in 1573, and, on her entrance"], [456, "136 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. to the town, being thirsty, she stopped at a little way-side well, and drank. The place is still existing, and is caded Queen Elizabeth's spring. A quaint old stone commemorates the event. Charles II. was there too, and so were the two first Georges, all detained by stress of weather. The rooms occupied by George II. were in a house at the south-west corner of Middle street. John Fletcher, the celebrated coadjutor of Beaumont the dramatist, was son of Richard Fletcher, vicar of Rye, after wards Bishop of Bristol, and was born here in 1579. The town was fortified with a stone wall, at an early period ; and need enough,* for it was several times attacked by the French, par ticularly in the reigns of Richard II. and Henry VI. In the former reign, 1377, the enemy landed with five vessels, and after having plundered the town, set it on fire. With his cus tomary exaggeration, the chronicler Stowe, asserts that \"within five hours they brought it wholly into ashes, with the church, that then was there of a wonderful beauty, conveying away foure of the richest of that towne prisoners, and slaying sixty-six, left not above eyght in the towne \" \u2014 total population 78 ! Among other spoils they carried off 42 hogsheads of wine. It is matter of congratulation, however, that the church, though some of its masonry has marks of fire, was but slightly injured. In 1447, on the second irruption, the town records are supposed to have been burnt. In the reign of Edward VI., 37 hoys are said to have left the haven at one tide, \"and never an Englishman among them.\" Rye suffered greatly in the 16th and 17th centuries from visitations of the plague and smad-pox, which destroyed many hundreds of the inhabitants. In 1562, on the breaking out of the war in France between the Romanists and Huguenots, when Elizabeth sent out a large armament to support the latter, 600 soldiers sailed from Rye. The history of this war is so well known as to require here no further reference. Rye afterwards became a place of refuge for the harassed Huguenots, and no less than 500 were soon collected here, so that provision could hardly be made for the support of this sudden accession to the popula tion. After the massacre of St. Bartholomew, 641 refugees entered the port, many remaining here, who had separate reli gious services, it is supposed in the old chapel of the Augustine Friars, under a Huguenot ministry. Some of the settlers were Flemings and Walloons. Jeake says that in 1582 there were 1,534 French refugees, though only a few of these can have settled here. In 1682 the Huguenots were permitted to have separate services in the parish church. At length, in 1685, came the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and Rye again received many additional refugees. The parish register contains very * The royal license for fortifying \" La Rye\" was dated 3rd March, 1369."], [457, "137 RYE numerous entries of their births and burials. Many of the des cendants remain in and about Rye, but with names so translated, misspelt, and Anglicized, that it is difficult to identify them. The names, however, of the Hamons, Taylors, Dansays, Guerins, Jewins, Valloys, Mercers, Sivyers, Michells, Lyons, Neves, Marrows, Tournays, Saverys, Reynoldses, Espinettes, Meryons, Gastons, Bournes, Paines, and several others, have long been denizened, in their corrupted orthography, in this part of Sussex. The flagon used by the French congregation - was presented in 1860, by the venerable historian of Rye, the late Mr. W. Hodoway, and his wife Sarah, nee Meryon, to the vicar and churchwardens, and though only of lead, is stdl preserved among the utensils of the Holy Communion in the parish church. For these and many other details of the foreign Protestants of Rye, as a \" city of refuge,\" I am indebted to the very researchful paper of Mr. W. Durrant Cooper, F.S.A., in the xiii. Vol. of the \" Sussex Collections.\" Besides the grand parish church, Horsfield mentions three smad ecclesiastical establishments in Rye ; the chapel of St. Clare ; the chantry of St. Nicholas, both afterwards used for the deposit of ammunition,* and the house of the Friars Eremites of St. Augustine, the chapel of which was also applied to secular uses. Of the last we have httle history. The parish church deserves careful examination, as being among the largest and most inter esting in Sussex. The earliest portions are the central tower, the transepts, and the plain semi-circular arches opening into them from the aisles of the nave. These are early Norman. In both transepts are fragments of a Norman arcade, with the zig-zag moulding. The nave is Transition-Norman. The chancel has a chapel 6r a subsidary chancel on each side. The east window is rich Perpendicular, filled with what Murray's \" Hand book Of Kent and Sussex, p. 249,\" styles \"Harlequin glass.\" A common tradition makes the communion table one of the spoils of the Spanish Armada, but it is certainly not older than temp. William III. The north or St. Clare's chapel is Early English, and it must have originally been very striking. The authority just quoted complains that \" it is impossible to speak too severely of the present state of this beautiful chapel, desecrated, neg lected, damp, and filled with ladders and fire-engines.\" It might be added that lately (when I last saw it) it was also the receptacle of a pillory and a \" cucking-stool,\" which latter shows that the \" good wives \" of Rye of yore were rather addicted to scolding, and sometimes required a \" ducking \" in the river. The south, or St. Nicholas' chapel, was long used as a school room for the poor. The church clock, the bells of which are * These were doubtless adjuncts to the parochial church."], [458, "138 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. struck by a pair of fat gilt cherubs, is said, like the commu nion-table, to have been the gift of Queen Elizabeth, a statement open to much doubt, though Mr. Octavius Morgan thinks it is the most ancient clock in England stid actually doing its work. The big pendulum swinging below attracts the notice of the stranger, as it seems as if intended to beat time to the services of the sanctuary. Near the communion-table is a brass to a civilian, 2Tf)0S. $?amon, six times mayor of Rye, and thrice M.P. for the borough, whose \" courage, justice, and gravitie \" are duly noted. Within this church, too, lies my old tried friend, Charles Hicks, who was also six times mayor, and whose straightforward ness of character was not inferior to that of Hamon. The church contains several good mural monuments, notably one for John Wollett, Esq., with allegorical figures. Other records of the dead relate to the families of Lamb, Slade, a quo the local anti quary, George Slade Butler, Esq., F.S.A., Dansays, Haddock Lawrence, Codett, Hay, Prosser, Davis, Dawes, Procter, Threele, of Lewisham (now called Leasham), Miller, Pinkerton, Wntinu J Brazier, Morris, Glazier, Francis, Barham, Hounsell, Butler, Haffenden, Chatterton, Backhurst, Odiarne, Carleton, Durrant, Hope, Norton, Kennett, Grebbell, and many others \" long to rehearse,\" but see Mr. G. S. Butler, in Vol. xiii. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" where all the inscriptions in the church and church yard are painstakingly recorded. In St. Clare's chancel is a monument to Aden Grebble, Esq., a member of one of the refugee families, and ten years mayor, who was assassinated in the church-yard in 1742, by a \"sanguinary butcher\" named Breeds, who slew him in mistake for his brother-in-law, Mr. Thomas Lamb, against whom he had a grudge. Breeds was hung in chains near the west end of the town, and the so-caded \"chains,\" an iron frame-work, are still preserved as a relic. The church contains eight beds, dated 1775, with quaint rhymed inscriptions. Besides the church there are two ancient buildings in Rye. The Land-gate, on the north-east of the town, is of noble pro portions, and forms a picturesque object. When the town was fortified, temp. Edward III., there were two other approaches called Ypres-gate, and Strand-gate, and a small postern at the bottom of Conduit-hill, but these have all disappeared within somewhat recent times, unless, indeed, the first-mentioned was identical with the castellated building still standing on the south east of the town, on a rocky eminence, overlooking the harbour, and called Ypres Tower. It is a prevalent, but I believe un founded, notion that this tower was named after William de Ypres, Earl of Kent, temp. King Stephen. This is quite im probable, since that noble is not known to have had any posses-"], [459, "139 RYE sions in Rye, and, secondly, the architecture is of much later date. It seems more likely to have received its name from a family of Ypres who were inhabitants of Rye in the 14th and 15th centuries. The building, which is a strong square pde, with a round tower at each angle, having been repaired, is now used as the borough prison. Rye has returned members to Parliament, as a borough by prescription, since 1369, and per haps from an earlier date. By the Reform Act of 1832, the number was reduced from two members to one, and in order to return that one it was necessary to bring several of the adjacent parishes within the borough limit. Among more recent repre sentatives have been, besides numerous members of county fami lies, Sir Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Welhngton, and another wed-known soldier, Sir De Lacy Evans. The history of the harbour has been given at large by Hors field and Holloway, from the time when Rye was an insulated rock, until our own days, when the port is two miles from tbe town. Besides the main river Rother, two unimportant streams called the Brede and Tillingham-water, now reach the sea through the harbour. Considerable fisheries exist here, and in the last age smugglers carried on a profitable traffic. From hence, during the French war, newspapers and correspondence were clandestinely conveyed to the Emperor Napoleon. Among other noteworthy inhabitants of Rye, were Samuel Jeake, sen., and his son and grandson of the same names. The former, born 1623, was a lawyer of eminence and learning, and as I have elsewhere had occasion to say, \" He was in politics a roundhead, in religion a nonconformist, and in science almost encyclop\u00e6dic.\" He was author of several works, including a huge volume of arithmetic, of almost 700 folio pages, with the learned title of \" Logistikelogia,\" published under the aus pices of the Royal Society ; but the book by which he will be best remembered is his very valuable \" Charters of the Cinque- Ports,\" translated with notes in 1678, but not published untd 1728. It is the text-book of the customs and liberties of the Ports, and is very scarce. Mr. Jeake was a preacher, and was much persecuted for his religious sentiments. To modern notions it seems incompatible that this truly Christian man should have addicted himself to Astrology and Alchemy ; but so it was, and though he had fud faith in what we now deem ortho doxy, he like many others believed in these occult sciences, and produced many horoscopes, which are still preserved. He died in 1690. His only surviving chdd, the second Samuel Jeake, was born in 1652, and at the age of 19 was acquainted with all his father's studies, and even more. Less wise and more superstitious was he than his father. He was, however, a"], [460, "140 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. kindly Christian man, and full of schemes. One of these was to marry Elizabeth, the accomplished daughter of Mr. Richard Hartshome, ex-master of the grammar-school of Rye, when she had reached the mature age of 13\u00a3 years ! By this marriage he had several children, one of whom, the third Samuel Jeake, like wise dabbled in astrology, and was known by the vulgar as the \" conjuror,\" but by the more cultivated as \" Counsellor Jeake.\" He was also a mechanical genius, and invented an apparatus to enable him to fly. His failure, however, was as great as that of Icarus, though without the same unlucky result. See notices of the Jeake family, in \" Sussex Worthies,\" and Holloway's \" History of Rye.\" Bryan Twyne, the eminent scholar, was appointed vicar of Rye in 1613, but was chiefly resident at Oxford, of which university he was the champion.

Now a farm-house merely, but formerly a Preceptory of Knights-Templars, in the parish of Newtimber. It was a manor at the date of Domesday. In Saxon times, Godwin, a priest, had held it of his namesake, Earl Godwin. The assessment was 17 hides, and there were 24 villeins, and 4 bondmen. Ralph held four hides in the same territory, with three vdleins and two bondmen. The total value in Saxon times was fifteen pounds, and after the Conquest eleven pounds. Some of the subsequent lords of the manor were Penfont, Browne, Viscounts Montague Poyntz, and the family of Wyndham, of Petworth (Lord Lecon field). There has been considerable confusion as to the abode"], [461, "141 SALEHURST. of the Knights-Templars, several authorities having fixed it at Sedlescombe, near Battle hi East Sussex ; but it is quite clear that the place now under consideration was the spot. \" Sadies combe\" was an extensive manor extending into the parishes of Newtimber, Bolney, Hurst-Pierpoint, and Twineham, and was held of the De Warennes in the 13th and 14th centuries by the powerful family of De Saye. Among the places to which John, Earl of Warenne, made his memorable claim, by exhibiting the sword with which his ancestor bad fought at Hastings, were Newtimber and Sadlescombe. There cannot be much doubt, I think, that the De Sayes founded this establishment for the \" half-soldiers, half-monks \" of the \" Temple of Solomon.\" Of the history of the Templars here we have few records, but we ascertain from documents that the churches of Southwyke, Woodmancote, and tithes and lands in Kingston-Bowsey, Shore ham, and other places, were held by the Brethren. On the sup pression of the Templars in 1309, the Knights-Hospitallers succeeded to their rule and possessions, which they held till the dissolution of the Monasteries. It is interesting to note that among the benefactors to the Templars were members ofthe families of Scrase and Farncombe, names for centuries identified with Sussex, and still existing in the county. For a full detail of this ancient Preceptory, I must refer to the article by Mr. Blaauw in the ix. volume of the \"Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Col lections.\" SALEHURST.

Those places are mentioned in separate articles. The parish, like most in this district, is beautifully undulated, and variegated with arable, woodland, pasture, and bop-gardens. There are several emin ences of considerable altitude, which command excellent views, especially Silver Hill. Several old families were connected with the parish. That of Wildigos resided at Iridge ; Higham gave name to a family ; while a branch of the \" ubiquitous \" Culpepers"], [462, "142 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. possessed the old gabled mansion called Wigsell. Boxhulle, now Bugsell, gave name to the family of Sir Alan de Boxhulle, one of the original Knights of the Garter. The family of Dicker were also of some standing in the parish. Fuder particulars of these famdies and the descent of their estates are given by Hors field. In more recent days the principal families have been Fowle, Peckham, Micklethwaite, Harcourt, Boys, and Luxford. On the commanding height called Silver-Hid, barracks of great extent were erected during the French war, about the end ofthe last century. The church (St. Mary) is of various dates, and is a very pic turesque structure. It contains a nave with aisles, and two chancels. The arches are pointed throughout. The tower, which is lofty and embattled, is entered by\" a porch at the west end, which also has battlements, and a~\"fine pointed arch. The arms of Echingham, Culpeper, and another are carved on this porch. Within a recess in the south aisle is a large altar tomb, but there is no record of its occupant. In the Wigsell chancel there are some old monuments ascribed to the Culpepers of that estate, but here, as in too many other cases, \" monuments themselves memorials need.\" There are tablets and inscriptions with the names of Ashe, Jenkin, Micklethwaite, Peckham, Fowle, Har court, Snepp, Stevens, Weller, and other families. There is a peal of eight bells, all of modern date. Altogether this is one of the most interesting churches in the district. See also the articles Robeetsbeidge and Huest-Geeen.

The locahty was early possessed by civilized man. Many traces of Roman occupation occur in the parish. On the cliff, less than a mile eastward of the town, is an earthwork locady called the Roman camp, and a Roman cemetery existed at Green Street, where, about the year 1825, a large number of sepulchral urns were ex humed. Coins of Hadrian and Pius, and of Antonia, daughter of Mark Antony, have been found here. Seaford was one of the claimants of the honour of being the Civitas Anderida, but that claim has been settled in favour of Pevensey. It has been sug gested, however, that Seaford is identical with the Mercredes burn of the Saxon chronicle, where, in 485, a' great battle be tween the South Saxons ancl the Britons took place. Seaford appears to signify a firth or fiord of the sea, and probably received its present designation from a colony of Norse men, who caded it Sae-Fiord, in reference to the bay of the English Channel on which it stands, and to the estuary which formerly extended inland beyond the town. The place is first mentioned, as Sefordt, in 1058, in connection with the removal of the remains of St. Lewinna, virgin and martyr, who had long previously died at the hands of the pagan Saxons. The remains had been kept in the odour of sanctity at a religious establish ment called St. Andrew's, probably at Alfriston. The story is given at length in \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections \" Vol. i, and also in the \" Worthies of Sussex.\" Soon after the Conquest Seaford became the lordship of Wil liam de Warenne, and continued in his descendants down to the reign of Edward III., when the family became extinct in the elder line. Chington, however, an important manor and vill in the parish was held, with Pevensey rape, by the famdy of De Aquda, lords of Pevensey, one of whom gave it to the priory of Michelham.* King John with his suite passed the night of the 23rd May, 1216, in this town. After the extinction of the De Warennes, Seaford was successively in the hands of the Poy nings, Fitz-Alan, Mowbray, and Howard families. When it be came a member of the Cinque Ports is not known : it must cer tainly have been so as early as 1229, when it is mentioned first among the limbs of the port of Hastings. Of all the subordinate ports this is the only one wliich returned members to Parlia ment. It is long since that Seaford actually possessed a port; the Ouse debouched there from a very early period until the 1 6th century when it was straightened and directed to the vidage of * In 7th Edw. I., Thomas Therel held a certain serjeanty in Chinting, co.

Meeching, which thence received the name ofthe \"New-Haven.\" The course of the old river is still traceable at the back of the beach, from Newhaven to the Cliff-end at Seaford. The decay of the harbour was not the only cause of the decline of the town \u2014 it had previously suffered greatly from several incursions ofthe French, from fire, and from the great pestilence of 1348, caded the Black Death. Prior to this, as we have seen, Seaford sent two members to Parliament, viz., from 1 298 to 1400. From that time there was no return until 1640, from which date it continued to be represented, until the Reform Act of 1832 swept away the electoral privilege. During the proprietorship of part of Seaford by the Poynings family, an attempt was made to found a new town in the east ern part of the parish, on a commanding portion of the South Downs overlooking the harbour of Cuckmere. There are traces of buildings extending over many acres, and the site is stid known as Poynings Town. A finer site for a town can scarcely be imagined. Henry VIII. gave a new charter to Seaford investing it with and confirming all Cinque Port privileges, which it stid enjoys, standing eighth in the roll of that ancient league, and being governed by a recorder, bailiff, jurats, coroner, and the other officials usual in the larger ports. Not long afterwards, in 1545, the French made their final descent upon the town, but were repulsed with disgrace by Sir Nicholas Pelham and an extempo rized force of townsmen and neighbours. As Sir Nicholas' ej)i taph at Lewes informs us, with a quaint pun \u2014 \" What time the French sought to have sackt Sea-Foord, This Pelham did re.pel'em back aboord.\" The municipality of Seaford has been duly preserved down to the present day, and is a j urisdiction independent of the county, having courts of assembly, quarter and petty sessions, with a town had, prison, &c, ad, of course, in miniature. The higher criminal causes are usually transferred to the assizes at the county town. The town records, from the year 1562, are in ex cedent preservation. The Parliamentary history of the borough presents the usual amount of corruption to which such small constituencies were exposed. One of the latest members, 1827, was the celebrated statesman, theRightHon. George Canning. At an earlier date William Pitt, the great Earl of Chatham, had represented it. As to matters ecclesiastical, there is a tradition that Seaford formerly had five churches, though there is no evidence of its having ever formed more than one parish, except that it was early united with the adjoining parish of Sutton, which is now"], [465, "145 SEAFORD. absorbed by it, the ecclesiastical designation being Sutton-cum- Seaford. There may, however, have been five ecclesiastical es tablishments, viz. : the parish church of Seaford, that of Sutton, the chapel of Chyngton, dependent upon Michelham Priory, the chapel of St. James, attached to a hospital of lepers which ex isted so early as the 12th century, in the northern outskirts of the town ; and (probably) another chapel attached to a guild within the town, the crypt of which remains in a garden called \" The Folly,\" over which the original town-hall is said to have stood. This crypt has recently been restored in excellent taste by its proprietor, Robertson Griffiths, Esq. Seaford and Sutton are both prebends in Chiehester cathedral. The parish church, dedicated to St. Leonard, untd lately, con sisted of a western tower, a nave, north and south aisles, and a modern chancel ; but, in 1862, the building underwent restora tions, and received the addition of two short transepts and a handsome chancel, terminating in a polygonal apse. The origi nal architecture was Norman, with insertions of later date, prin cipady of the Transition period. One of the capitals of the columns, between the nave and the south aisle, is curiously sculptured with the Crucifixion and other subjects, and there is also a slab with an early representation of St. Michael and the Dragon. There are no monuments of early date. Of Sutton church some remains are stid traceable in a close near Sutton Place. Sutton and Chyngton (or Chinting) were formerly re garded as vills of Seaford, and the Corporation seal contains the legend \"Sigfllvm. Burgensium. de Saffordia \u2014 with Suttonii, et Chyngton.\" The devices are (obv.) an Eagle forDe Aquda, and (rev.) a three-masted ship. Seaford is agreeably situated on the bay to which it gives name, and of which, from the chalk cliffs to the eastward, a beautiful prospect is obtained, including views of the town and surrounding country, Newhaven harbour, Lewes, &c. The cliffs between the town and Cuckmere are bold and romantic, and on the verge, near the junction of the Chyngton and Sutton farms, is a ledge called \" Puck-church parlour,\" no longer the abode of fairies, but the resort of foxes, ravens, sea-gulls, and peregrine falcons. A hermitage existed on these cliffs in 1372. For many years the town has been resorted to as a quiet retreat for sea-bathers, and recently an impulse has been given to building. Could proper sea-defences be made, and the common lands in front of the town brought into proper order, Seaford would offer one of the best sites imaginable for a watering-place. Were the scheme for a breakwater and harbour of refuge in con nection with Newhaven carried into effect, this would become the most important point between Dover and Portsmouth. VOL. II.

LEONARDS (sometimes called St. Leonards-on-Sea). In the Bape of Hastings ; a suburb of Hastings ; it has a Station on the South- Coast Bailway. The town of St. Leonards, formerly a small village (if village it could be called), sprang into importance when Mr. Burton erected a new and fashionable town. This grand undertaking resulted in additional popularity to Hastings proper. St. Leo nards is situated partly in a valley, which has some pretty scenery inland. The principal range of buildings, called the Marina, extends along the sea front, and there are many agree able residences around, as also every appliance of a modern waterin g-place. Theodore Hook, in \" Jack Bragg,\" thus alludes to St. Leo nards : \u2014 \" From the meditation in which he was absorbed, Jack was aroused upon his arrival at that splendid creation of modern art and industry, St. Leonards, which perhaps affords one ofthe most beautiful and wonderful proofs of individual taste, judgment, and perseverance that our nation exhibits. Under the superintendence of Mr. Burton a desert has become a thickly-peopled town. Buildings of an extensive nature and most elegant character rear their heads where but lately the barren cliffs pre sented their sandy fronts to the storm and wave, and rippling stream s"], [467, "147 SEDLESCOMBE. and hanging groves adorn the valley which a few years since was a sterile and shrubless ravine.\" Dr. Granville, in his \" Spas of England,\" says : \" The whole of this varied region must be a little paradise to invalids ; and the houses, whether those detached as Italian or Lombard vdlas with gardens, or those placed in rows like a series of Gothic cottages, all equally desirable, are much sought after The Victoria Hotel has the appearance of a nobleman's mansion. A wide street runs up on each side of it, leading to other and less regular series of buildings, constituting the town of St. Leonards, and also to that paradise of detached vdlas to which I have already alluded.\" St. Leonards has really no history until 1828, when Mr. Burton commenced his buildings. It lies partly in the formerly almost extinct parish of St. Leonards, and partly in that of St. Mary Magdalen. Previously to Mr. Burton's purchase, it had be longed to the families of Lewis and Eversfield. The parish extends beyond the limits of the Corporation of Hastings. The church was built at private expense in 1831, and the Princess Sophia of Gloucester laid the first stone. SEDLESCOMBE.

The broad village street, which has some antique houses, is highly picturesque. On the little river Brede there are traces of the iron-works formerly carried on here. Roman remains have been discovered in connection with these works, proving that that enterprising people avaded themselves of our mineral treasures. Powder mids have long existed in the parish. Sir William Bun-ell, who has been followed by Horsfield and others, confounds this parish with Saddlescombe, in the parish of Newtimber, on the South Downs, which had a Preceptory of Knights Templars. The manor passed from Earl Godwin to his son Harold, and after the Conquest it was held of the Earl of Eu by Walter Fitz-Lambert. In 23rd Edward I. William de Echingham was lord.

Hancox, in this parish, was some time the seat of a junior branch of the Sackvdles ; Great Sanders has for more than three centuries been the estate of the Bishop family ; and Brickwad was, in the seventeenth century, the seat of the Farendens, wealthy land owners and iron-masters. This must not be confounded with Brickwad in Northiam. The church (St. John the Baptist) occupies a commanding site. It consists of a chancel, nave with aisles, and west tower, surmounted by a low spire. The chancel arch is semi-circular.

An outlying portion of the parish of Broadwater, in the Forest district between Horsham and Nuthurst. It contains about 150 acres. For two centuries after the Conquest the manor, which extends into the two parishes above mentioned, belonged to the family of Le Sauvage, lords of Broadwater, who, in 1272, exchanged it with William de Braose for other lands. It passed with Bramber until 1572, and since, by purchase and descent, it has been vested in Caryll, Bennet, Lennox, Tudor, and Nelthorpe. The ancient castle, or hunting seat, which formerly existed here belonged in succession to the Le Sauvages and De Braoses. The park, which surrounded it so lately as 1608, consisted of 624 acres. The building, as appears from the existing remains, was about 200 yards in circuit, and had a double moat. Until within the memory of man much more of the outer walls remained than can now be traced. The vestiges lie within the grounds cf Mr. Nelthorpe, of Nuthurst Lodge, who takes due care of them. About 30 yards beyond the outer moat is a supply of water called St. Mary's, or more commonly the Nun's, wed. [S. A. C. Sedgwick Castle (Turner), viii, 31, 40.]"], [469, "149 SELHAM. SELMESTON.

In 25th Edward I., Roger Lewknor held the manor of the king by Knights' service, and it remained with his descendants until 44th Elizabeth, when John Wood was lord.

Mays belonged in the 17th century to the famdy of Nutt, and is now part of Lord Gage's estate. Sherrington, the property of James Skinner, Esq., belonged in early times to tbe Peverells, and afterwards to John, son of Oliver Brocas, one of the prisoners taken by the French at the battle of Rotting dean, 1377. It afterwards had a family of its own name, and the heiress of Simon Sherrington married John Selwyn, whose descendants removed about temp. Henry VII. to Friston. In the 17th century the family of Caldecott possessed it, and from them it passed to the family of the present owner. Tilton (in Domes day, Tedetone) is in this parish, and is now a farm belonging to Lord Gage. In 1403 a party of French marauders came to Selmeston and carried off John Iford, servant of Robert Profoot. The church (St. Mary), which has just undergone repairs, previously consisted of nave, south aisle and chancel, with a dove cot turret and tapering spire. The style is Early English, and the notion that certain unsightly posts pointed to a pre-Norman wooden church is altogether erroneous. The church has, how ever, one rare peculiarity, the Altar slab of marble with five crosses, which remains in situ, and is still used as a communion table. In the north wall of the chancel is a recessed altar- tomb for Dame Betris Braye, daughter of Ralph Sherley of Wiston, 1532. There are other memorials to the names of Rochester and Caldecott. When smuggling was carried on in these parts, the \"free-traders\" had a rendezvous in the churchyard. An old altar-tomb served as their temporary storehouse. By lifting the incumbent stone they could safely deposit their goods, and it is said that they never failed to leave a \" tub \" or two for the use of the parson !

This peninsula is in many respects, geographical and his- torical, one of the most interesting parishes in the county. The indent oi the land into the channel called Selsey Bill is the most southerly land in Sussex, and is bounded on the west by Bracklesham Bay. It possesses little variety of contour, being generady of flat surface and liable to incursions ofthe sea, from which it has suffered severely. The earliest monastery founded in the county was that established by Saint Wilfred, bishop of York, who having been tyrannically driven out of his diocese, settled down here for some time, in order to Christianize the South-Saxon pagans. King Edilwalch, and Ali, his queen (new converts), and Ceadwalla, king of Wessex, also a convert of the Saint, became benefactors to the monastery, and an Episcopal See was founded here by Wilfred, whose successors for 400 years were known as bishops of the South Saxons. Here the see re- mained under a long line of prelates until the year 1070, when it was deemed expedient to remove such establishments from vdlages into cities and towns. Of the Saxon cathedral and its demesnes no traces remain \u2014 on shore, that is \u2014 because the sea has so encroached that \" the Park \" has long been under water. The trees, the deer, and all the etc\u00e6tera of palatial grandeur have utterly disappeared. Stid it appears that, so lately as the time of Bishop Rede of Chiehester, about the middle ofthe 14th century, Selsey Park was in existence, and poachers stole deer therefrom. The prelate excommunicated the offenders, by \" bell, book, and candle,\" and styled them \" sons of damnation.\" The site of the palace is supposed to have been nearly a mile from the present shore, and that of a submerged forest is still traceable at low water, in the shape of stumps of trees. So lately as November, 1824, nearly half the parish was temporarily under salt water. There are fine firm sands on the shore, and a con- siderable fishery for oysters, lobsters, crabs, &c, is carried on. A place near the shore called the \" Hushing* Pool \" presents a singular phenomenon. About midway between the churches of Pagham and Selsey the water at certain times of the tide appears to be in a state of ebullition, as if from the rushing of immense volumes of air to the surface. The space so occupied measures about 130 feet by 30. The sound of the bursting of the bubbles is said to resemble the simmering of a large cauldron, and may be heard on shore to the distance of a quarter of a mde. The * Query : li this word be not a corruption of \" hissing \" ?"], [472, "152 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. cause is conjectured to be a large cavity from which the air is expeded by the in-rush of the water. The vidage consists principally of a long street. The old parisb church (Our Lady) stood almost two mdes from the street, but it has recently been removed, except the chancel, which is retained for burial services. A new church (St. Peter) has recently been erected close to the village. The old fabric origin ally contained shrines for St. Katherine, St. James, St. Mary, St. Margaret, and St. Nicholas. The building is supposed to have been constructed by Bishop William Rede, between 1369 and 1385. On the south side ofthe church-yard is a large earthwork with a deep ditch, and other parts of what may have been a British fort were no doubt obliterated by the erection of the church. Some early tombs remained in the nave when I last visited the budding, including several coffin-stones with crosses in relief, probably for ancient rectors. Against the north wall of the chancel there is a monument pleasingly designed, for \" Jhon Lews, Sqwyr, and Agas bis wife,\" who died in 1537, \" on whose soul Ih'u have marce.\" Their effigies are represented on a smad scale, and behind them are their patron saints, St. George and St. Agatha. The peninsula which formerly became insulated at high water had to be reached by a ferry, but a raised causeway has been constructed, and by means of this it is at ad times accessible. According to Domesday, Selesie was held by the Bishop in domain. In the time of the Confessor it was rated at ten hides, and valued at =\u00a312 ; after the Conquest at \u00a310. There were 14 villeins and 11 bondmen. In 1561 the manor was dismembered from the see of Chiehester, and vested in the Crown. In 1635 it was purchased by Sir Widiam Morley. On a subsequent pur chase (1736) by Sir Henry Peachey, Bart., it passed to his family, whose nephew, Sir James Peachey, Bart., was created Baron Selsey in 1794, and in his descendant, the Hon. Mrs. Vernon Harcourt, it now vests. Medmeney and Berkleys are reputed manors in the parish. The prebend of Selsey was trans ferred to Chiehester, and Bartleys and East Thorney are pre bendal manors. Among the curious local manufactures of Sussex may be men tioned that carried on in this parish by Mr. Pullinger.

Seats, Shermanbury Park, Mrs. Hunt ; The Grange, Mrs. Hoper. Our ancestors frequently indicated their land boundaries by trees, and this was the case at Shermanbury. A tree at the north east corner of the parish shows its junction with Bolney, Twineham, and Cowfold. At the time of the Domesday Survey the place was held by Ralph, of William de Braose. The ubiqui tous Azor had been the previous tenant under Harold, and was rated for two hides. There were a smad church, four ministri, and three bondmen ; and the manor was estimated at 24 shidings. From the date of the Conquest to 1349 the manor belonged to the family of De Buci, or Bowsey, lords of Kingston-Buci, near Shoreham. The De Buci family, as under-tenants of the De Braoses, lords of Bramber, paid murage* to them, but they were exempted in 1267, on payment of 48 marks. Sybil de Buci, co heiress of the last male heir of that ancient Norman race, married Sir John de Islebon, and they assigned Shermanbury to the other co-heiress, Joan, wife of Sir William de Fyfhide. John de Islebon, and Sybil, renounced, in favour of Sir Widiam and Joan, their claim to the right of \" the coat of arms, crest, and helmet,\" belonging to the late Hugh de Buci \u2014 a singular, though not unique instance of this practice in heraldry during the middle ages. After the extinction ofthe male line of Fyfhide in 1387, the manor belonged for a time to their heritors, the family of Sandys. Widiam, Lord Sandys, in 1542 sold it to Widiam Comber, Esq., whose great-grand-daughter, Elizabeth, married Thomas Grat wicke, Esq., and his great-grand-daughter, Anne, wife of Thomas Lintot, Esq., had an only daughter Cassandra, who married Henry Famcombe, Esq., and their only daughter and heiress Cassandra, was wife of John Challen, Esq., father of the late Rev. J. Gratwicke Challen, D.D. The old manor house, which was puded down about the year 1780, was of quadrangular arrangement, and was replaced by a convenient mansion, which stands in a small deer-park. The Comber famdy, who possessed the estate for several generations, produced two well-known * For the reparations of Bramber Castle."], [474, "154 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. personages. Thomas, Dean of Carlisle, and John, Dean of Dur ham, who both flourished in the 17th century. It was traditional in the family that the first of the Combers killed a Saxon noble man at the battle of Hastings, and was rewarded by the Conqueror with the manor of Barkham, in Fletching, but the pedigree recorded by the Heralds goes no further back than the reign of Henry VI., and their residence was then at Balcombe, where the name stid survives. Shermanbury contains several other manors : \u2014 1. Morley, whence, perhaps, our ancient family of that name ; 2. Sakeham, which in the 13th century gave name to the famdy of De Sake ham ; 3. Ewhurst, which extends over a considerable portion of this parish and into Cowfold and Henfield. It was the ancient residence of the Norman family of Peverel, and passed in the same line of descent as Offington to the Lords La Warr. Before the year 1600 it was acquired by the Pelhams, and passed suc cessively into the ownership of the families of Byne, Heath, and Challen. The old manor-house is destroyed, but the moat, and a most picturesque gateway, said to be of the time of Edward I. (Cartwright), though probably considerably later, still exist. In the reign of Philip and Mary, Thomas West, the opulent Lord La Warr, occasionally resided here, and a document of that period mentions \"my Lord's great chamber,\" a nursery, buttery, kitchen and other apartments. \" Abbey Lands \" in this parish form the corpus of the Prebend of Wyndham in Chiehester cathedral. The church (St. Giles) is a small building, originally in the Early English style, but it has been modernized. It contains tombstones and tablets to the names of Gratwicke, Farncombe, Dr. Bear (rector for more than 50 years), Challen, Lintot, &c. The font, which has been mutilated, is probably of the 13th century. Dr. John Burton, the eminent scholar, and author of the whimisical tour in this county called \" Iter Sussexiense,\" mentions Shermanbury, which he visited in 1751, where his step father, Dr. Bear, was rector, and describes it in classical Greek.

Chief Land owner, Sir Percy Burrell, Bart. Seat, Knepp Castle, the property of Sir P. Burrell, and occupied by Major John Aldridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1609. This parish consists principally of arable, but there are pasture, woodlands, shaws and furze. The gault produces very fine oak timber, and the wheat is of excellent quality. The principal estate in the parish is Knepp, on which formerly stood Knepp Castle, a fortress of Norman date. In a grant from Widiam the Conqueror to William de Braose, it is styled the \"manor and park of Cnap.\" Of the baronial fortress nothing now remains except a part of the keep. The castle was origi nally surrounded by a moat. A considerable portion of the out works remained until the beginning of the present century, when the surveyors of highways demolished it for the mending of parish roads ! The De Braoses, Lords of Bramber, who built the castle, were occasionady resident in it. King John visited it twice on his hurried and hasty journeys through Sussex. The families of Mowbray and Howard were afterwards in possession, but, hav ing better houses elsewhere, the castle was suffered to go to decay. The estate followed the same line of descent as Bramber. On the attainder of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, 38th Henry VIII., the manor and demesne devolved to the Crown, and they were conferred, 1st Edward VI., on Sir Thomas Seymour, on whose attainder, two years later, they were restored to the Duke of Norfolk. In 15th Elizabeth they were again vested in the Crown, and descended by successive purchases to the families of Nye, Caryd, Belchier, Wicker, Ryder and Raymond. On the death of Sir Charles Raymond, Bart., in 1789, they descended to his two coheiresses, one of whom married Sir Widiam Burred, Bart., whose grandson, Sir Percy Burrell, is now proprietor. On the estate, half a mile north-west of the ruins of the castle, the late Sir Charles Merrik Burred built a large mansion in the castedated style, which now forms one of the most convenient residences in Sussex. It contains a very valuable gadery of pictures. Close to it is the largest piece of water in Sussex \u2014 Knepp pond, measuring more than 100 acres. It forms a beau tiful adjunct to the scenery. Knepp gave name to a famdy. Paganus de la Knappe ap pears as a benefactor to Sele or Beeding Priory. In the southern part of the parish is an estate called Hook land Park, which belonged to the great estate of the De Braoses. William de Braose obtained a charter of free- warren for it, when it was caded Hoke la Stoke. Temp. Charles I., it belonged to the Henshaws, from whom it descended to Bartholomew"], [476, "156 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Tipping, Esq. By Mary-Anne, his niece, wife of the Rev. Philip Wrought on, it was sold to Philip Rickman, Esq. It is an extinct manor. Garingle, or Goringlythe, belonged suc cessively to Le Sauvage, Nevill, Lucy, Caryll, and Peachey. Bentons, formerly called Tavernershall, belonged in 1359 to Thomas de Bayntune, whence the modern name. From the Bayntons, or Bentons, it passed in the lapse of time to the Carylls. In the early part of the eighteenth century, it was purchased by Edward Tredcroft, Esq., of Horsham. The manor of Pinkhurst extends into the parishes of Slinfold and Billings hurst. The Earls of Arundel were possessors in the fourteenth century, and it was granted in 1399 to John, Duke of Exeter, but in 1400 was restored to the Earl of Arundel, and continued with his descendants untd 1576, when it was aliened to John Apsley of Thakeham. It now belongs to the Norfolk family. During the time that the principal part of the parish was in the hands of the Carylls, Phdip Caryll, Esq., built on an elevated site a house called \"New Building.\" It consisted of many rooms, and in a closet belonging to the garret there was a cup board with two shelves, which served for steps. This was one of the many \"hiding places\" for Romish priests. This func tionary could ascend through a false top of the cupboard to a place of concealment. A chapel attached to the building was commenced, but never finished. The Carylls were the leading Roman Catholics in Sussex at the time. Durrants is another extinct manor, which was long the property of the Michell family. There is a tradition that, during the civil wars, some members of this family headed an attack on Knepp Castle, then garrisoned by the Parliamentary forces, but there are no docu ments relating to this siege. The church (probably St. Mary), which was formerly served by a \" conductitius \" or removeable curate, consists of a single pace or nave with a tower, surmounted by a pyramidal shingled spire, between the nave and chancel. The length is 114 feet. The tower arches are semi-circular. The one opening into the nave is elaborately ornamented. The edifice dates from the be ginning of the twelfth century, when it was appropriated to the Knights-Templars ; but many later insertions have been made. The ceiling is of oak, flat, and divided into compartments, which have been painted alternately azure and gules with gilt knots and mouldings. On the former there were, in 1830, some armorial bearings including the Maltravers fret and the coat of Lucy. On the south side of the chancel is a splendid but dila pidated monument of marble, representing a recumbent knight in armour, and, below, the kneeling effigies of his children. This is for Sir Thomas Caryd, of Bentons, who died in 1616. There"], [477, "157 8HULBRED PRIORY. are other old memorials for the names of Michell, Hindley, Harmes, &c. In the church chest is a wooden reliquary of great interest and value. It is seven inches long and six high, and is gdt and enamelled on the sides and ends, with the subject of the Crucifixion and with angels. It is probably of Byzantine workmanship, and apparently of the 12th or 13th century. On the north side of the church there was formerly an echo, which, in a still night, repeated the 21 syllables : \u2014 \" Os homini sublime dedit c\u0153lumque tueri, Jussit et erectos.\" But, alas ! as at Bodiam, the responsive nymph has become shy, and no longer favours us by flinging back our words into our teeth.

This small monastic foundation was in the parish of Linch mere, on tbe north-west confines of the county, near Midhurst. It was founded by Sir Ralpb de Arderne, before the reign of Henry III. for five Augustinian canons. Its history possesses little of interest. At the dissolution of the monasteries it was granted first to Sh Wilham FitzWilliam, and afterwards to Sir Anthony Browne. Some remains of the Priory stid exist in a farm bouse, with medieval features. There is a room of consid erable size, known as the Prior's chamber, which is reached by a stone staircase. This apartment retains some mural paintings, about which a great deal has been said in topographical works, as if they belonged to pre-Reformation times. This, however, I am sure is not the case. They clearly belong to about the beginning of the 17th century, and are quite in the taste of that quaint period. They are nearly obliterated, but stid possess considerable interest. The principal painting has reference to the birth of Jesus Christ, and certain animals converse on that great event. The interlocutors are first a cock, which has a label issuing from his mouth, and the words Christus natus est. Then a duck says, Quando, quando ? A raven rephes, In hac nocte.

OLD SHOREHAM. Domesday, Soresham; a parish in the Hundred of Fishersgate ; Eape of Bramber, adjacent to New Shoreham, its Post-town and Bailway station. Population in 1811, 210 ; in 1861, 282. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1566. It is a vicarage valued at \u00a3458, in the gift of Magdalen College, Oxford ; Incumbent, Bev. Jas. Bowling Mozley, B.D. The parish consists partly of low meadow or brook-land on the left bank of the Adur, and partly of arable and down. Before the Conquest it was held by the great proprietor, Azor, of the King. It was then rated at 12 hides. After that time it was assessed at 5-|- hides only, and had a church, 26 vdleins, 49 bondmen, and a wood yielding sustenance for 40 hogs. At a later date it became parcel of the Duchy of Cornwall, and was purchased of the Crown by Charles, Duke of Norfolk. Another manor of Old Shoreham, alias Ruspar, belonged successively to the famdies of Arundel (Fitz-Alan), Cobham, Bowyer, Boorde, Gage, Blaker, Monk, Elliston, Elliot, and Bridger, the last named famdy being possessors of the estate of Buckingham, with its handsome mansion. This estate gave name to the family of De Bokyngham. The manors of Erringham-Walsted and Erringham-Braose are now united. The latter belonged in early times successively to the families of De Wistoneston, De Harcourt, Bavent, Braose, Shirley, Bellingham, Juxon, and Tufton. In 1774 it passed to the Bridger family, now proprietors of almost the whole parish. The Bellinghams were an old Northumberland family (whose descendants are still resident in Sussex), and were proprietors tid 1650. An ancient ferry over the Adur belonged to the Priory of Hardham. This was super seded in the last century by a wooden bridge, 500 feet long, and since then the Norfolk bridge, and the railway bridge, lower down the Adur, have altogether outdone the once-famed Shore ham bridge. The cruciform church (St. Nicholas) is in the Norman style, and has within the last few years been repaired and refitted. Mr. Hussey says of it : \" It is remarkable for the small number of windows, and the consequent darkness of the nave ; as also for possessing on the tie-beams of the chancel the tooth-mould ing, which is rarely found carved in wood.\" The interior arches"], [479, "159 NEW SHOREHAM. are highly ornamented.

It is a Post-town, and has a Bailway station. Union, Steyning. Population in 1811, 770; in 1861, 3,351, and now upwards of 4,000. Benefice, a Vicarage, in the gift of Magdalen College, Oxford. Incumbent, Bev. Harris Smith, D.D., of Oriel Col- lege, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1568. This parish of 170 acres is the smallest in the Rape of Bram ber, though both its present population and its former historical importance place it in a good rank among Sussex towns. Shore ham has undergone the vicissitudes common to every seaport on our southern coast. On the decay of Old Shoreham, consequent on the decline of the port which once existed there, this town sprang into existence, and was dismembered from its mother parish. It was the port of the river Adur, and had more mari time commerce than any town in Sussex. The river now de bouches at Kingston-Bowsey, a considerable distance eastward of the town. The harbour is convenient, and much trade is carried on. But by the encroachments of the sea in and before the year 1432 its population was reduced to 500, and the inhabi tants were in a state of great poverty. The manor, which is co extensive with the parish, belonged to the De Braoses, lords of Bramber, and followed the same line of descent as that barony. In 1326 a house of Carmelite Friars was founded here by John de Mowbray. There is little history connected with this esta blishment, and it shared the common fate under Henry VIII. There were also two hospitals dedicated respectively to St. James, and Our Saviour Jesus Christ. The borough of New Shoreham returned two members to Parliament from 23rd Edward I. ; but in the year 1770, a cir cumstance occurred which changed the character of the borough. A society calling themselves the Christian Club, nominally formed for charitable purposes, but actuady for the sale of the representation, became the subject of Parliamentary investiga tion. The result was that in 11th George III. the borough was disfranchised, and the right of election was extended to ad 40s. freeholders in the Rape of Bramber. Eighty-one of the club were ousted, but the rest and their successors retained their"], [480, "160 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. votes. In the reign of Edward III. the port of Shoreham fur nished forth towards the royal fleet before Calais 26 ships and 329 mariners. The church (St. Mary) was, as originally built, a fine cruciform structure, 210 feet in length ; but nearly the whole of the nave fed to decay. An effort, however, has been made to restore it, and the rest of the edifice, at a cost of \u00a310,000. The nave, tower, and transepts are Norman, but the capitals on the north and south sides of the tower indicate a difference of date. The rich choir end is later, and disproportionately long with reference to the west limb of the cross (Hussey). The church is one of the most beautiful and interesting in the county, as well as one of the largest. It is externally and internally most grand and picturesque. For architectural details I must refer the reader to Cartwright's \"Rape of Bramber,\" p. 57. The tower contains five beds. The monumental remains are of little interest. The only medieval one is a brass representing a civdian and his wife in the costume of the time of Henry VI., without any inscrip tion. The names commemorated by the others are West, Shirley, Aldersey, Forth, Bulford, Smith, Chapman, Rudhad, Hooper, Kilvington, Reynolds, &c. The election of members for the borough was formerly held in the north transept of the church ! Both this church of St. Mary and that of St. Nicholas, Old Shoreham, were given by William de Braose, the first Lord of Bramber, to the French Abbey of Saumur. They were both probably built by the great baronial family of Braose, assisted by the opulent merchants of the port.* Shoreham in early times received several royal visits. In 1199 King John, immediately after the death of C\u0153ur-de-Lion, landed at this port, which was then a great entrepot of continental corn and wine. He was accompanied by a considerable army. In the same year he embarked here for the purpose of holding a con ference with the King of France. The place then possessed an arsenal, and was equady important as to shipping with the port of Plymouth, and superior to those of Bristol, Dover, and London. In 1305 Edward I. was here on one of his southern journeys. In the reign of Henry VIII. the town suffered much from the predatory inroads of the French. In the great storm of 1 703, Shoreham was severely visited. The market-house, a strong and ancient building, was blown down, and ad the town shattered. * It is, perhaps, not correct to say that the churches were given by De Braose to the Abbey of Saumur, because neither of them was erected so early as 1075 ; but the ecclesiastical rights of Shoreham were certainly granted to that establishment, and alterwards transferred to the Priory of Sele, now Beeding"], [481, "161 SIDLESHAM. Shoreham is not prepossessingin appearance. Its chief orna ment, besides the church, is the fine suspension bridge crossing the Adur, which was built in 1833 at the expense of the Duke of Norfolk, and has been of material advantage to the town. The principal trade carried on is that of ship-building, and the maritime commerce includes relations with many countries. The movement of what are called \" higb church principles,\" has one of its chief centres in the town, and there are two educa tional establishments known as St. Saviour's and St. Mary's, for the sons of the \" lower middle class.\" A full history of this ancient town is a desideratum in Sussex topography.

The manor was conferred by the Saxon monarch Ceadwalla on Wilfred, as a portion of his gift to the see of Sel sey, and this grant was confirmed by William the Conqueror to that see. It was rated at 12 hides, and there were 16 villeins with 14 bondmen. There were under tenants, named Gilbert, Rozelin, and Ulph. The value before and after the Conquest was \u00a310, and the bomagers paid 65s. The manor vested in the Bishops of Chiehester, till they were deprived by the act of 2nd Elizabeth.

George Stoughton, one of the Commissioners under that act, bought, it was averred, for \u00a3300 what was worth \u00a3300 per annum. The property subsequently passed to the names and families of Compton, Farrington, Bull, Johnson, Price, &c. The prebend of Sidlesham is in Chiehester cathedral, and possesses a farm here and in Earnley, ancl it has undergone many changes of ownership. The prebend of High ley, which belongs to the master of the Prebendal Grammar School at Chiehester, founded by Bishop Storey, long possessed a large portion of the great tithes of Sidlesham. Okehurst, an estate in the south part of the parish, formerly gave name to a family, one of whom founded a chantry in Chiehester cathedral in the year 1287. There are in the parish two reputed manors, called Hammes and Keynor, of no historical interest so far as I have been able to discover. The Sidlesham tide-mills, the only ones in Sussex, except those at Bishopston, in the eastern divi sion of the county, are supplied by the estuary of Pagham Har bour. They were erected by a merchant of Chiehester, Mr. Woodroffe Drinkwater. The estuary affords considerable ship ping facilities for vessels of small burden. This parish has suf fered greatly (like many neighbour parishes) from the incursions of the sea ; as many as 2,700 acres are said to have been \" de vastated,\" though probably not permanently submerged, before the year 1341. This we learn from the Non\u00e6 Rolls. The church (St. Mary) is a very picturesque building in the Early English style, with an embattled tower of later date. In the building is a carved chest of considerable antiquity, which is figured in Horsfield's \" Sussex.\" Near the chancel is a mural monument with two kneeling figures, for George Taylor and his wife Rebecca, daughter of John Bennet, of London, Esq., 1631. There are two beds, one of which is inscribed, in Lombardic cha racters, to St. James. There seems to have been a chapel, caded Easton or Eston, connected with Sidlesham, but Mr. Gibbon, in his elaborate ac count of West Sussex churches and chapels, cannot discover its locus in quo. In several wills of the sixteenth century Eston is called a parish, and offerings of sheep and cows were bequeathed. It would be interesting to ascertain the site of this defunct chapel.

In Domesday Book Silletone is mentioned as having been the property of Earl God- win, and was estimated at \u00a389. Afterwards it passed, with the Rape of Chiehester, to the Earl of Montgomeri, and was valued at \u00a393, and a mark of gold. Upon =the division of the Fitz- Alan estates, John, Lord Lund ey became possessor. By an act 31st George II. , Charlton Forest was granted by the Crown to the Duke of Richmond, and in his family it still vests. Drove House, the property of Lord Leconfield, is occupied by the Hon. R. Denman, and Molecombe House, the property of the Duke of Richmond, is the mansion of Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar. The Goodwood race-stand is in Singleton. During the week of those celebrated races nearly one hundred race-horses are stabled in the parish, and the lovers of the turf get accommodation in the neighbouring cottages. Rooks Hdl, which is said to have derived its name from St. Roche, is upwards of 700 feet above the level of the sea. It commands one of the most magnificent views in Sussex, including the coast from Beachy Head to Ports- mouth, and a grand expanse of inland scenery. On this hill are ancient earthworks called the Trundle, probably of early British date.

Oliver Haweis ; Hyde, Edward Smith Bigg, Esq.; The Hall, Edward Stanford, Esq., &c, &c. The parish abounds with excellent residences. This Wealden parish contains the four scattered hamlets of Slaugham proper, Handcross, Warninglid, and Pease-pottage \u2014 all names of uncertain etymology, except the second, which shows the former existence of a medieval direction-cross, with a hand affixed to point out the principal road. The parish, though somewhat sterile, is undulating and picturesque, and well suited for country houses and villas. A tributary of the Ouse \u2014 or perhaps the Ouse itself \u2014 rises at Upper Beeding, close by, and here, at Slaugham mill, expands into a lake of 25 acres. This place is not mentioned eo nomine in Domesday, and it was probably at that period unreclaimed from the great forest tract. Early in the reign of Edward III., however, it was useful as hunting-ground, as is proved by the fact that Thomas, Lord Poynings had a charter of free-warren here. At his death, in the memorable sea-fight at Sluys, the manor and advowson descended to his son Michael, who accompanied the king in his Continental wars, and was buried at Poynings, where, and at this place, masses were annually said for his soul, as they also were for his son and successor, Thomas, Lord Poynings. At subsequent dates the noble families of Berkeley and Stanley became in succession lords. In the latter part of the fifteenth century the grand old family of Covert, of Norman descent,"], [485, "SLAUGHAM. 165 became owners, and so continued until 1679, when Sh John Covert, Bart., dying without male issue, the estate became a portion of the inheritance of his elder coheiress Anne, who married Sir James Morton. Subsequently it passed from the Morton family to that of Sergison, in whom it now vests. The Coverts were among the greatest landed proprietors in the South of England, and tradition says that they might travel over their own manors from Southwark to the English Channel. Before becoming possessed of Slaugham they were lords of Sullington, and previously, temp. Henry IL, of Chaldon in Surrey. In 1494 William Covert, Esq., probably the original settler here, bequeathed 40s. to the repairs of the church where he desired to be buried, and to have a \" vertuous priest \" (Dr., M.A., or B.A.) to sing for his soul at the yearly stipend of \u00a38. Several later members of the family were buried in the church. Of the earliest residence of the Coverts and their predecessors nothing is known. The now existing remains of the manor- house are doubtless part of what was originally one of the finest mansions in Sussex. The site is low and damp, and quite unworthy of an almost palatial abode. Sir Walter Covert, of Maidstone, who married his cousin Covert, the heiress of Slaugham, was probably the builder ; but, like many other Sussex mansions of that period, it seems to have been erected only to fall to almost immediate neglect aud decay. The remains are, however, \" sublime in ruin,\" with lofty arcades and splendid heraldric decorations. Of these Mr. Blaauw has given very accurate descriptions and views in the \" Sussex Codections,\" Vol. x. The dimensions, 175 feet by 133, give an idea of its great size, but its ambit was far larger, with a square stone wall, turrets, and a moat \u2014 the latter no longer existing. A large sheet of water, close by, was, however, connected with it. The style of the house was a rich and graceful Palladian. The in- terior court measured 80 feet ; the great hall was 54 feet long, and the kitchen 35 feet, with a great fire-place 13 feet wide. It is sad to look upon the ruins of this fine old mansion, though great pains have been taken to preserve what time and mercen- ary spoliation have left us. The great staircase, of the Jacobean period, much resembling (though better than) that at the Charter- house in London, is now to be seen at the Star Hotel at Lewes, the re-builder of wliich, Mr. Ade, rescued it in the last century from destruction. It is most elaborate in ornamentation, and has several allegorical carvings. The house originally had a private chapel, and was surrounded by a park. According to tradition the domestic establishment numbered 70 persons. Tbe benefice is styled in tbe Liber Regis, \" Slougham cum Crole,\" which would indicate that the neighbouring church of"], [486, "166 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Crawley was formerly a chapel dependent on it. The church (St. Mary) is chiefly in the Decorated style, with traces of earlier work. It consists of an excedent vaulted nave, south aisle, tower, and two chancels. The northern chancel or chapel was built by the desire of Michael de Poynings, whose will is dated 1368, at a cost of \u00a340. It had an altar dedicated to St. James. The tower is low, and contains five bells, dated 1773. There are several interesting memorials of the Covert and other fami lies. A full leno-th brass commemorates 3fot)N (\u00c6obfVt, Esq., son of William Covert, 1503 ; and another, Jane Covert, who survived two knightly husbands, and died in 1586. A monu ment in the chancel is for Richard Covert, Esq., who, together with his two wives, and a numerous progeny by the first marriage, are represented in effigy \u2014 date 1579. The most remarkable monument is for Richard Covert, who married four times, and who is represented with three of his conjuges, with curious allegorical adornments, and labels in brass \u2014 date 1547. There are later memorials for the names of Evans, Matcham,* Edison, &c. During the progress of alterations in this church some years since, several mural paintings were discovered. They represented the Flagellation, Crucifixion, and the Last Supper of Our Lord, together with the conveyance of a soul to heaven by angels. [S. A. C. Ironworks, ii, 217. iii, 242.

His son, Anthony James, Earl of Newburgh, died without issue in 1814, and Slyndon ultimately passed to his cousin and heiress Dorothy Eyre, Countess New burgh, who married Colonel Leslie, K.H., and so conveyed it to him, and he now possesses it. Slindon House is presumed by Dallaway to have been originally built by one of the Arch bishops, in the thirteenth century, and the celebrated primate Stephen Langton died here in 1228. After its acquisition by the Kempes, Sir Garret Kempe, early in the reign of Elizabeth, rebuilt the mansion, which has been altered and added to at various periods. It is delightfully situated on an elevation in a richly wooded park, and commands a sea-view from Worthing to the Isle of Wight. The Slindon beeches have a wide re nown. The great had is rich in the armorial ensigns of the Kempes and their family connections. The Roman Catholic chapel has a good picture of the Taking-down from the Cross, and among the fine works of art with which the house is adorned, is the celebrated painting of the Beggar of Antwerp. This is one of the few places in Sussex in which the cultus of the Roman church has been preserved with little interruption from the days of the Reformation. A new Roman Catholic church was erected in 1865, the Rev. John Sheehan being priest. The parish church (Our Lady) is small, consisting of nave, north and south aisles and chancel, in the Early English style. In a re cessed tomb in the chancel is a knightly effigy in wood, supposed to be for Sir Anthony Kempe, the grantee of Slindon in the six teenth century, but quite as likely to be that of Anthony St. Leger, whose wdl, dated 1539, directs burial here. There are other memorials of the Kempes, &c* (Horsfield). At the en trance to the church-yard there stood, within memory, a chapel of St. Mary, with one lancet window.

Seats, Strood Park, N. P. Simes, Esq.; the Lodge, Captain Bunny; Windalls, Thomas Child, Esq., &c. This Wealden parish lies on the Roman road called Stane street, which, passing from Chiehester to London, intersects it for the space of more than two miles. The material called Horsham-stone abounds in the north-east part of the parish. The principal manor, Dedisham, is divided between Slinfold and Rudgwick. It belonged to the family of Tregoz from 1271 to the extinction of that family, and in 1530 it was in the hands of their heirs-general, the Lewknors. In 1547, Edward VI. granted it to Sir Richard Blount, Lieutenant of the Tower, from whose descendants it passed about 1630 to the family of Onslow. In 1786, J. Williams Onslow, Esq., sold it to Charles, Duke of Norfolk, and it now forms parcel of the hereditary estates. The great park has been converted into farms, and the ancient manor house, after having been ransacked by Sir William Waller's soldiers in 1643, fell to decay, though a few of the offices re main as a farm-house. The manor of Drungewick lies partly in this parish, and is called Bradbridge. The family of De Bradbridge held it hereditarily from the Bishops of Chiehester from 1355 to 1517, when Sir Henry Hussey obtained it by mar riage with Eleanor, sole daughter and heiress. The seat was called Town House. George Hussey of this family is supposed to have aliened his right about 1666, and the lands form part of the settled estates of the Duke of Norfolk. Strood belonged in succesion to Atte Strode and Stanbridge. In 1466, John Cowper, Esq., lineal ancestor of the Earl Cowper, and of the poet, ac quired it in marriage with the heiress of Stanbridge. The representative of the Slinfold Cowpers sold the estate to John William Commered, Esq., who was sheriff of Sussex in 1803. \" A great part of the ancient residence of the Cowpers still re mains, to which considerable additions have been made by the present proprietor.\" Dallaway (1832).

It had until recently a nave and north aisle, with a small sepulchral chapel belonging to the manor of Dedisham, and a massive tower with shingled spire. The last \" was supported by four upright beams, of a length and diameter very seldom seen.\" (Dallaway.) In 1779, repairs were made which concealed the ancient features. In 1861, the church was rebuilt in the Early Decorated style from designs by Mr. B. Ferrey, at a cost of nearly \u00a34,000. Dallaway mentions among the memorials a -slab for Richard Bradbryge, gent, and his family, 1533 ; another supposed for Ralph Cowper, of Strood ; the helmet and crest of Sir Henry Hussey, 1557 ; two murai monuments of alabaster, with painted figures for Mary, wife of Richard Blount, and daughter of Sir William West, Lord La Warr, and her daughter, Katherine, 1617, and Jane Blount, another daughter, 1621; Edward Cowper, of Strood, 1678; and his son Henry Cowper, 1 706 ; and grandson Edward Cow per, 1725; with other memorials for Leland, Lowe, Jones, &c. In the Dedisham chapel is the carved figure of a lady, supposed of the Tregoz family. Matthew Woodman, grandson of Richard Woodman, the Protestant martyr burnt at Lewes in 1557, was ejected from this rectory in 1662 for nonconformity. [ S. A. C. Ironworks, ii, 217.

John Blake Honnywill, B.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1546. Acreage, 2,930. Seat, Sompting Abbots, Henry Crofts, Esq. This parish contains about 1,000 acres of down, the rest being fertile arable land, sloping towards the south. At the date of the Domesday survey there were 19 villeins, and 16"], [490, "170 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. bondmen, a church, 5 servi, a mill, and 8 salt-pans. A knight held one hide, two villeins, four bondmen, and a salt-pan. Tn the time of the Confessor it was estimated at \u00a38, and afterwards at \u00a37 8s. Lewin held lands of King Edward. The particulars of this manor are circumstantially given in the record. At present the principal manors are Sompting-Peverell alias Welda, Sompting-Abbots, and Lechepool. The manor of Sompting- Peverell extends into the parishes of West Grinstead, Horsham, and Rusper, in the weald, whence the alias Welda. It con tinued in the family of Peverell for several generations until about the end of the 14th century, when it was carried by co heiresses to the families of West and Brocas. From the Wests, Lords De la Warr, it passed by subsequent purchases to the families of Pelham, Langworth, Morley, and Peachey. Somp ting-Abbots belonged in early times to the Abbey of Fecamp, in Normandy, whose monks held a capital messuage and revenues ; hence the name Sompting-Abbots. The house has been rebuilt within the last few years in the medieval style, and is now one of the most elegant mansions of the district. On the dissolution of the alien priories it was conferred on the Abbey of Sion in Middlesex, and on the surrender of that religious house it was valued at \u00a317 6s. 9d. Soon after this surrender it was granted to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk ; but on his attainder in 1547 it reverted to the Crown. It afterwards returned to the Howard family. Thomas, Earl of Arundel, sold it, in 1641, to Sir Edmund Pye, and afterwards, by successive alienations, it passed to the family of Alderton, and then to that of Crofts, the present possessors. The manors of Sompting-Peverell and Sompting- Abbots are much mixed up together. Lechepool gave name to a family in the 14th century. The lands were acquired by Richard, Earl of Arundel, who conferred them on his alms-house at Arundel. At the Dissolution the estate was granted to Sir Richard Lee, and we afterwards find it in the hands of the families of Cooper, Moore, and Stanyoake. It is now the property of the family of Crofts, and passes with Sompting-Abbots. Cokeham is a hamlet in this parish (See that article). The impropriation of Sompting was granted between the years 1146 and 1173 to the brethren of the Temple of Solomon. On the suppression of the Knights Templars, in 1306, Sir Andrew Peverell resumed it, and conferred it on the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until the Dissolution. At an earlier period the ecclesiastical property was known as \" The Temple,\" and gave the name of \" At Temple \" to its tenants. The church of this parish is decidedly the most interesting vdlage church in the diocese. It has many peculiar features,"], [491, "171 SOMPTING. which have been so repeatedly figured and described that no de taded account is necessary here; suffice it to say that it was budt about the year 1150. The nave, chancel, and transepts remain, though some parts of the whole building as constructed in the pre-Norman times are in ruins. There are several rude sculp tures of very early date in the chancel ; but perhaps the most curious relic in the building is an arched tomb, of which I gave an account, originally in the \" Herald and Genealogist,\" and more recently in the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Codections.\" The particulars are so curious that I venture on some self-quota tion : \u2014 \" My first visit to this church took place under the guidance of Dr. Davey, of Worthing, whose researches into the monastic history of the county of Suffolk are well known. After inspecting the tower and other remarkable features, I observed in the north wall of the chancel a monu- ment in the style of the so-called \" Easter Sepulchre,\" or \" Founders' Tomb,\" but apparently not earlier in date than the former part of the 16th century. There was no inscription to guide me to the knowledge of the person interred beneath, and on interrogating my friend and cicerone upon this point, I received the curt and unsatisfactory reply, ' Nobody knows !' This I afterwards found to be the case, for the his tories of Cartwright and Horsfield and the Handbook of Murray, all yielded a response equally unsatisfactory. ' Well,' said I, ' there are some shields upon the tomb ; let us see whether Heraldry will not help us to an identification.' Accordingly I took out my note-book and made some memoranda, which I subjoin .... The workmanship of the tomb is very poor, the stone bad, and the heraldric sculpture evidently the work of an unskilled artisan, probably the village mason ; added to which it has until recently been coated with profuse layers of whitewash, in the removal of which the work may have suffered accidental mutilation. The armorial coats appear to be as follows : \u2014 \" Under the canopy an Angel supporting a shield impaled .... the dexter coat three pairs of keys in saltire, on a chief three dolphins ; the sinister two bars, in chief a lion passant. On the face of the tomb 3 shields, 1 , quarterly : 1 and 4, 3 bucks trippant ; 2 and 3, 2 bars and a lion-passant as above ; 2, quarterly : 1 and 4, a covered cup with two objects not very intelligible ; 2 and 3, a leopard's head ; 3, very much defaced, \"though three dolphins may be made out at the upper part of the shield. The arms are, therefore, probably identical with those first above described. \" The coat with the bars and the lion passant, a Sussex antiquary had little difficulty in assigning to the well-known family of Tregoz, persons of leading importance not far from Sompting. \" But alas ! what of the cross-keys and dolphins, the bucks trippant, the covered cups and leopards' heads ? Clearly they did not belong to Sussex heraldry, and I was on the point of giving them up, when a vague recollection of a paper, written by Mr. J. G. Nichols, in vol. xxx. of the Arch\u00e6ologia, which I thought might assist my inquiry, occurred to me. On turning to page 506 of that volume I found the first coat to be that"], [492, "172 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. of the Fishmongers' Company, as anciently borne. The same paper also enabled me to identify the shield with the leopards' heads and covered cups as that of the Goldsmiths' Company ; and from another source I discovered that the. 3 bucks trippant (with which Tregoz is quartered) were the arms of the Leathersellers' Company. Thus I was able to identify the whole of the bearings.\" Not to enter further into the arguments which I have adduced, there is no doubt that this tomb covers the remains of Richard Burre or Burry, whose will was made 19th Henry VIII., and still exists at Chiehester. His descendants are yet residing in this parish. The will is very curious, and contains among other bequests the great tithes and glebe of Sowntyng, called the Temple, \" that I hold of the house of Saynt Jonys.\" He also directs an obit for his soul and his wife's, eleven years in the church of Sowntyng. He makes bequests to the friars of Chiehester, Arundel, and Beeding. That he was a man of considerable position is shown by the fact that he kept a chaplain, Sir Robert Bechton, who was to sing for his soul. [S. A. C. Templars at, ix, 257. Serf given to, ib.

The church, popularly called St. Michael's, is given by Mr. Gibbon to St. Margaret. It has an interesting Norman tower, with shingled spire ; but the body of the edifice has been re built in a style difficult to characterize. The memorials include the names of Gray, Norton, Bridger, Hall, &c. The church was given in the 13th century by Simon le Counte to the Knights Templars at Saddlescombe, in Newtimber. John Pell, F.R.S., the skilful, but unfortunate mathematician, son of John Pell, rector of Southwick, was born here in 1610. (\"Worthies of Sussex, p. 177.)

The surrounding park is beautifully undulated, and well planted, and has its principal entrance nearly midway on the road from Lewes to Brighton. The village lies within the boundaries of the park. The church, which has been rebuilt by the present Earl of Chiehester, is plain and neat, and contains memorials for the families of Scrase, Goffe, Michelborne, and Martin.

In Saxon times the manor was held by Eddiva of Earl Godwin ; at the Conquest William gave it to Earl Roger de"], [496, "176 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Montgomeri. In later times William de Perci held it of William de Albini. On its seizure by the Crown, Henry VIII. granted it to William, Earl of Southampton. Subsequently it vested in Bulstrode Peachey Knight, Esq., and it was sold by Lord Selsey within the present century to Sir Charles William Taylor, Bart., whose son, Sir Charles Taylor, is now lord, and resides in the parish. The village is seated in a pleasant rising ground above the Rother. The church of St. James, which represents one men tioned in Domesday, was partly taken down, rebuilt, and \" re stored\" in 1850. It consisted of chancel, nave, and central tower, which bears the date of 1670. During the progress of pulling down, some mural paintings of interest were discovered. The subjects were St. George and the Dragon, St. Ursula, St. Chris topher, and the Final Judgment. These have been fully described in the \" Sussex Collections,\" vol. iv. Mr. Butler, the architect, from the rude vestigia in the nave, considers the building to be identical with the Domesday church. Many stones, with crosses in relief, and four stone coffins, were found in the walls, having evidently been placed there as material in some comparatively recent repair of the building. The chancel has Early English features, and the font is ancient. [S. A. C. Church, mural paintings, iv, 1. Architecture, &c, iv, 19 ( Vernon-Har court and Butler).

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1565. Acreage, 3,383. Steyning, like many other parishes in Sussex, finds an able exponent in its own incumbent, the Rev. Thomas Medland, whose paper appears in Vol. v. of the \" Sussex Collections.\" The parish lies on the north side of the South Downs, near thfe point where the bills slope on both sides to the Adur. It is partly on the Downs, and extends northward to the Weald clay, the inter mediate space being sand and fertile loam. The chief part of"], [497, "177 STEYNING.\" the population is found in the picturesque little town, situated on the malm rock. The name appears to be derived, not from tha Anglo-Saxon stone, but from one of the Saxon mearcs, and meaning the abode of the children of one Staen, the patriarch of a noble family, who probably lived towards the end of the fifth century. (See Kemble.) It was then a place of little importance, and it was reserved for St. Cuthman, tbe titular patron of the parish, whose life by the Bollandists I have abstracted from the Acta Sanctorum in \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 23, to raise it to some renown. It is .pretty certain that that personage erected the first church (a wooden one), doubtless on the site of the present noble edifice. Both the saint himself and Ethel wulf, father of Alfred the Great, are believed to have been buried here. Other claims have been set up as to the burial-place of this unfortunate abdicated King of Wessex, but Asser Mene vensis, Alfred's preceptor and secretary, says distinctly \" Athel wolphus rex sepultus Steninge.\" King Alfred bequeathed his estates here, with others in Surrey, to his nephew Ethelwold, but they afterwards reverted to the Crown, and Edward the Con fessor granted them, subject to a life interest of Bishop \u00c6lfwine, to the Abbey of Fecamp, in Normandy, but afterwards revoked the grant, at the instance of Earl Godwin, whose son Harold held Steyning until his fad at Hastings. After the Conquest, William restored it to the monks of Fecamp, who thereupon sent over six of their number to form a priory, or cell, at Stey ning. These Benedictines founded their house on the site after wards occupied by the parsonage-house. From Domesday we learn that the lands belonged principally to the foreign abbey, though William de Braose, Lord of Bramber, had a portion of them. He, not content with his share, made encroachments on the possessions of the brethren, which resulted in an appeal to Henry I., who confirmed ad the rights which Fecamp claimed. Steyning was in those days a thriving and well-frequented place. According to Domesday there were no less than 223 vil leins and 106 bordars, while in the town itself there were 123 dwellings. The Abbot of Fecamp proceeded to erect a church suitable to this increased population, Two churches are men tioned in the record, one being on the foundation of the original establishment of St. Cuthman, and the other probably a succur sale, or chapel of ease. The principal part of Steyning was known as the parish of Cuthman, whde the other church or chapel appears to have been situated on the south side of High Street. It was dedicated to St. Mary, and near it was a well, sacred to the same saint, but now covered over. The church (St. Andrew), as j ust remarked, doubtless occupies the site of the humble wooden edifice of Cuthman. When the VOL. II. N"], [498, "178 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. brethren of Fecamp built their church they seem to have taken tbe church of Graville, in Normandy, dependent on their abbey, as their model. The greater part of what now remains of this noble church is apparently of the time of Henry I., though the capitals of some of the pillars and a rude bas relief are supposed to be of the time of the Confessor. The original plan was never completed. The building, as it stands, consists of a west tower, nave, north and south aisles, and a chancel. The nave and aisles are somewhat narrow. The former is very lofty, with round headed clerestory windows. Between the nave and chancel are four very high substantial arches, apparently intended to sup port a central tower. The present tower was added at a later period, when all idea of extending the church westward had been abandoned. Mr. Medland thinks that a south transept was built, but this has long disappeared. The more modern parts of the structure, particularly the tower and porch, have worked stones from a more ancient and ornamental structure. The nave, with its round pillars, carved capitals, and circular arches with zigzag mouldings, is particularly grand and impos ing. The church anciently possessed a chantry of the Virgin, and chapels or altars for St. Peter, St. Christopher, and the Sa lutation. The chancel was reconstructed some years since, not in accordance with the rest of the building There are no monu ments of greater antiquity than one dated 1508, for Mighill Farn field (or Farnfold) and Joane his wife ; but there are mural tablets and slabs for the names of Michell, Prowd, Gratwicke, Co ventry, White, Stalman, Ingram, Leeves, Mille, Smith, Lucke, Hooper, and many others. The bells are six in number. In the thirteenth century Ralph de Neville, Bishop of Chiehester, claimed obedience from the Canons of Steyning. The Abbot of Fecamp resisted, and it was decided that Steyning church should be free of all episcopal jurisdiction. In 1278 the town was of sufficient political importance to return two members to Parliament, and, though much dimi nished in population, it continued to do so down to the period of the Reform Act in 1832. Up to the early part of the fourteenth century it was of some commercial consequence. In Saxon and Norman times, when the estuary of the Adur flowed up thus far from Shoreham, it had a port known as the Harbour of Steyning, or St. Cuthman's Port, where the smad vessels of the period could ride in safety. Like many other places on the South coast, however, the river having narrowed, Steyning lost its maritime importance, as shipmen could no longer reach it. It was further unfortunate when, at the suppression of its priory as a cell of Fecamp, temp. Henry V., the fostering care of the foreign abbey was withdrawn, and a transfer was made to Syon"], [499, "179 STEYNING. Abbey, in Middlesex, tbe brethren of which cared less for it. Thus Steyning gradually dwindled down to the proportions of a mere village, and only rose to what it now is by the independent exertions of its inhabitants. The manor of Charlton Court, which had formed the principal part of the monastic possessions, was annexed to the Honour of Petworth, and after the Dissolution was sold, with the advowson of Steyning, to Widiam Pellatt, Esq., from whose family it has passed by transfer to those of Lewknor, Shirley, Tufton, Evers field, and Goring. Wickham, another ancient manor, has been associated, since 1307, with the names of Graundyn, de Lyche pole, de ifield, de Wickham, de Cobham, Percy of Petworth, Hystede, Farnfold, and Trevor. Wappingtborne is a Domesday manor. \" William Fitzmanne holds Wopingthorne. Carle held it of King Edward.\" It was then assessed at six hides, now at two only. There were seven villeins and 15 bondmen. In the reign of the Confessor it was worth 100s., and afterwards \u00a34. In 1268 Haymen Boynet paid to William de Braose 18 silver marks for Wowend and Wappingthorne, to exonerate him from the latter's claim of murage, a tax due to the Lord of Bramber for the reparation of the walls of his castle. In his family it remained till 1351. It afterwards became the property of the Dukes of Norfolk. In 1607 John Leedes, Esq. left it to his son and heh, Sir Thomas Leedes, K.B., who held it of the Castle of Bramber by knight's service. Edward Goring, of the Burton family, held it temp. Charles I., and resided here. Of the house, now a farm-house, there are considerable remains. It is a brick building, with large windows divided by stone mullions. Over the portico is a shield of 12 quarterings, entirely defaced. It stdl belongs to the Goring family. (Cartwright, 1830.) Gat wick, near the church, was another ancient residence, which gave name to a familyr. The vicarage-house is a good specimen of a parochial manse, with some curious carved wainscot, having the arms of St. Richard of Chiehester, Fitz-James, Bishop of London, and the arms and cognizances of Henry VIII. and Queen Catherine. The gardens are well kept, and a clear stream of water runs through them. Among the rockwork have been placed two ancient stones with crosses, brought from the found ation of the western extension of the church, and evidently of Saxon date. There was an ancient guild or fraternity in Steyning. The old \" Brotherhood hall\" formed part of the endowment of the Grammar School, founded in 1614 by William Holland, alder man of Chiehester, and the school is still carried on under the gables of that ancient hall, standing on the right hand of the street leading down to the church. n 2"], [500, "180 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. Iii Saxon times Steyning had a royal mint, and among the pennies brought to light at the now celebrated \"Chanctonfind,\" were 11 coined here. They are of the reigns of Edward the Con fessor and Harold ; but an earlier coinage doubtless existed. Of the various types, Mr. J.C. Lucas, F.S.A., has given an account in the \" Sussex Collections,\" Vol. xx. Roman antiquities have been found here. In 1826 a barrow on the Down overlooking the town was removed for the sake of the flints. On its summit, about a foot from the surface, were found three entire skeletons, and in the surrounding fosse upwards of 40 more. An urn, with burnt bones and 50 coins, chiefly of the Lower Empire, were also discovered. [S. A. C. Town and church (Medland), v, 111. xvi, 236. St. Cuth man, v, 112. xx, 214.

Area, 860 acres. This small parish, which is separated from South Stoke by the river Arun, is of some arch\u00e6ological importance. Its area has been so variously stated that it is somewhat difficult to know its real extent. Dallaway states it at 930 acres ; a late statisti cal publication says 160 ; but the Population Tables of 1852 say 860, which I presume is correct. The manor descended with the castle and barony of Arundel till about 1600, when on the at tainder of Philip, Earl of Arundel, it was some time afterwards granted to Thomas, Lord Howard de Walden. In 1611 it be longed to Richard, Earl of Dorset, who sold it to John Stans field, Esq., the founder of South Mailing church in East Sussex. From him it descended to his grandson, John Evelyn, Esq., the"], [501, "181 SOUTH STOKE. author of \" Sylva \" and \"Memoirs.\" At later periods it passed through the families of Mitchell and Joliffe to the late Earl of Egremont. To the east of the village is Camp-field, once a strong earth work, upon a steep acclivity, much worn by ploughing. Many ancient coins and other relics have been found here. The church is cruciform, with a low tower and a spire. There are three sedilia in the chancel. The building, which was de pendent on Tortington Priory from 1337 until the Reformation, is large in proportion to the parish. The dedication is un known. In 1834 an ancient British canoe or boat was discovered about 150 yards from the river Arun. It was formed from a single oak tree hollowed out, and was more than 34 feet long. The late Earl of Egremont presented it to the British Museum. Singu larly enough another similar boat of smaller dimensions was found near the same spot, at Burpham in a creek of the same river, and is now in the museum at Lewes Castle, together with its wooden anchor \u2014 perhaps one of the greatest arch\u00e6ological curiosities in the county. It was presented to the Society by Thos. Spencer, Esq., of Warningcamp. [S. A. C. Ancient British boat or canoe, xii, 261. Church bell, xvi, 225. Biver Arun, xvi, 258. Manor of, xviii, 78.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1558. Acreage, 1,294. This parish (Anglo-Saxon Stoe, a place) lies in the valley of the Arun, where that river is remarkably tortuous, and, as Dallaway observes, \" refluis sibimet s\u00e6pe obvius undis.\" Nearly 700 acres of the parish are within the new pale of Arundel Park. There are two manors, which have remained distinct since the time of Domesday. In that record it is extremely difficult to define the limits of this parish, and that of the adjacent one of North Stoke, but a church is mentioned in both places. Of the two manors, one is described as having been held in Saxon times of King Edward by Brixi, and afterwards of Earl Roger (de Montgomeri) by Rainald. It was rated at eight hides. There were seven plough-lands cultivated by sixteen villeins and"], [502, "182 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. sixteen cottars, and two fisheries rendering lOd. The other manor was held by Ulnod, a free tenant, temp. Confessoris, and afterwards of Earl Roger by Ernald, probably the same person as Rainald above-mentioned. It was rated at four hides, and sustained ten villeins and four cottars. Its value was \u00a34. Offham (Anglo-Saxon, the ham or settlement of Offa*) was held of King Edward by a freeman named Al win ; after the Conquest Azo held it of Earl Roger. It contained four hides, and there were eight villeins and five cottars, a fishery of 2s., and a wood of three hogs. It was valued at different periods at \u00a37, \u00a36, and \u00a34. According to the Testa de Nevill, John de Nevid held lands here, which were transferred to the Fitz-Alans, Earls of Arundel. In the compotus of Richard, Earl of Arundel, 1380, the manor was valued at the large sum of \u00a320 6s., with a grange. It passed through the families of Dixse, Sackville, and Kempe, and the late Earl of Newburgh by exchange to the Dukes of Norfolk, and is part of the settled estate of that great family, who also possess a farm in Offham, formerly the property of the Dean and Chapter of Chiehester. William de Albini, Earl of Arundel, granted about 1,172 lands in Offham to Hugh Esturmie, and a copy of the charter is printed by Dallaway, p. 222. Upon the chalk downs in this parish there are many earthworks and trenches. \" The most remarkable trench,\" says Dallaway, \" is that which leads from the summit to the river at its base \u2014 the pro bable remains of a road by which the camp was supplied with water. . . . The general opinion is that they are Danish. Danorum veteres fossas\u2014 immania castra, Etcircumducti servat vestigia valli.' \" In 1796 a considerable number of Saxon pennies was ex humed near Offham, and this find resembled that of 1866 at Washington as being mostly of the reigns of Edward the Con fessor and Harold, and fresh from the mint. The church (St. Leonard) is small, but of high antiquity. It consists of a single pace or nave only, with a corbel table orna mented with the heads of animals and birds at the east end. The \" high-stream \" of the river Arun was formerly important in regard to the fisheries and the swans, which latter were duly marked in old times, and there were rules and regulations for the fishermen, beadles, and under-bailiffs to superintend these matters, and the practice of \" swan-hopping\" was kept up. The *Wehave in our Anglo-Saxon annals more than one historical Offa ; but the name, judging from the local nomenclature of England, must have been a very common one ; thus we have in Sussex two Offhams, and one Offington, besides several minor places with the initial syllable Ojf."], [503, "183 WEST STOKE. following regulations respecting swan-marks on the high-stream are worthy of record : \u2014 \" Swan-marks, 1624. \" Earl of Arundel butted on the right wing, and their heels both cut off ; Bishop of Chiehester on the left wing, and three notches on the right side of the beak ; Sir W.

This lady became the wife of R. Bransby Francis, rector of Edgefield, co. Norfolk.

The church (supposed to be dedicated to St. Mary) is small, and \" built upon the Norman plan, with a pace or nave only, and a square tower at the west end. Upon the ancient door is a cross fleury, in iron. The windows are ornamented with stained glass, which is said to have been taken out of the old had.\" These decorations consist of armorial bearings and imagi nary portraits executed at tbe expense of Walter Barttelot, Esq., in 1 638, by Roelandt, a Dutch artist. There is this inscription in a window : \u2014 Ad formam h\u00e6c eenovata fenestra priorem, 1638. There are coloured drawings of these embellishments in the Burrell MSS., British Museum. But the most remarkable fea ture in this little edifice are the memorials of the Barttelot family, including a most interesting series of brasses, &c, for many generations, and almost covering the whole of the pave ment. The first is to iSartflOtt, treasurer of the house hold to Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and his wife, Johanna, daughter of William de Stopeham, 1428. The next is to 3Joi)annrs Uattclott, \" Consul prudens \" to Thomas, John, and William, Earls of Arundel, and Joan his wife, daughter and heiress of John Lewknor, Esq. This tomb has the figure of a man in the armour of the period \u2014 date 1453. The third has two brass effigies, to the memory of 3&tc. Uartclott, Esq., marshall to the Earl of Arundel, 1489. The next in the series is to gjofjaniUS ISattflott, 1493. Then follows a long series of memorials to the same ancient family, down to much more recent times. One of these records William Bartelott, Esq., who died in 1601, aged 97 years. Instead of the ancient formula, \" Orate pro anima,\" we are informed that his \" soul restethe with God.\" There are two bells, one of which is inscribed to St. Augustine. Thomas Newcombe, M.A., incumbent of Stopham, who died in 1766, in his 91st year, was descended in the female line from the poet Spenser. He wrote many poems in English and Latin, and was a friend of Dr. Voung. His principal work on the \"Last Judgment,\" in 12 books, after the manner of Mdton, was printed in folio in 1 723. [S. A. C.

Of the initial sydable, \" Utrum mavisque accipe \" for the derivation. The parish is of irregular shape, and the soil varies from the chalk of the South Downs, to sand and loam on a substratum of sand rock. The town-village consists of two streets intersecting at right angles. Domesday mentions Estorchetone as held by Robert, of the Earl, but previously by Durand. A church is mentioned, and there were six hides, six villeins, seven cottars, and two mills. Temp. King Edward its value was \u00a34, and afterwards 40s. Another Storcheton, apparently a separate manor, was held of Earl Roger de Montgomeri, by Robert, and Alwin was the sub-tenant. Alwin was a freeman under the Confessor, and could go where soever he pleased, and dispose of his land at pleasure, according to the ancient expression, \" Potuit ire, cum terra, quo volebat.\" This estate had one villein, five cottars, two serfs, and a mill. The value was 30s. The manor of Storrington is valued in the computus of Richard, Earl of Arundel, at 60 marks per annum. On his attainder, in i388, it was granted to John Holland, Duke of Exeter. It was afterwards restored to the Earls of Arundel, and remained with them till Henry Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, conjointly with his son-in-law, John, Lord Lumley, conveyed it to Wdliam Apsley, Esq., of Thakeham, whose second daughter, Jane, carried it by marriage to the family of Newton, of South over, near Lewes. It was afterwards possessed by Wheler, Butler, and Batcock. In 1806 it was transferred to Charles, Duke of Norfolk, and still remains with that noble family. Hurston comprises the demesnes of the manor of Wiggonholt, originally part of the barony of Bramber. Its value, at the time of the Survey, was 10s., and it was held by Aluiet, of William de Braose. A mill is mentioned. Of its descent, nothing appears until 1634, when John Monk, Esq., who had married a daughter of Edward Covert of Slaugham, was pos sessor. It has since belonged to Ediston, Eliot, Swayne, Ash-"], [507, "187 STOERINGTON. burnham, and Wyndham, Earl of Egremont. Fryern, or Frier's land was the original endowment of a chantry in Thakeham church, founded by Stephen le Power, the patronage of which descended to the Apsleys. Subsequent proprietors have been Barttelot, Duppa, Banks, Moulding, and Postlethwaite. It was re-sold to Charlotte, Baroness Dowager King, and her son, the Hon. Geo. King, enlarged the house and resided in it. It is now the seat of Fredk. King, Esq. Chantry farm, part of the Apsley estate, passed to the Shedeys, of Lewes. Cootham, or Coudham, is a hamlet about a mile west of the town. It was manorial at the time of Domesday. In the reign of the Confessor, two freemen held it ; afterwards Robert, of Earl Roger, and Alberic of him. It was valued at \u00a33, and there were four villeins, and five cottars. Robert also held of the Earl two hides, which had one villein and a cottar ; value, 20s. Upon the great partition of the earldom of Arundel, a knight's fee was assigned to Roger de Someri. It is now divided into many smad freeholds. The market charter was granted by Thomas, Earl of Arundel, in 1399. The Bynes were of Storrington for many years. James Byne is mentioned so early as 3rd Edward III., and Thomas Byne in 23rd Henry VIII. The church (St. Mary) has been much altered from its original form. On May 20th, 1731, the shingled steeple was struck by lightning and fed upon the nave. In 1746 the tower fell, and the damage was estimated at \u00a31,625. The church, except the chancel, was rebuilt, and it has now a nave, north aisle, and west tower. On the floor of the chancel is a brass, in ecclesias tical costume, for Henry Wdsha, B.D., chaplain of Henry, Earl of Arundel, 1591 \u2014 a rare instance of so recent a brass. There are two monuments by Westmacott, one for Sir H. Holds Brad ford, K.C.B., 1816, erected by his companions in arms, in recog nition of his great military services at Copenhagen, Corunna, Flushing, Salamanca, Vittoria, and Waterloo, where he received a wound, which resulted, after 18 months, in his death. The second has a female figure in relief, bending over a pedestal, and commemorates Major Hugh Falconer, 1827. The rectory house, built soon after 1621, has been much improved by more recent incumbents, and is now one of the best in the county. Several antiquities have been found in the parish, including a Celtic urn, 21 inches high, and one of the finest specimens of its kind ; many Roman coins, &c. [S. A. C. British urn, i, 55.

A parish in the Hundred of Westbourne: Bape of Chiehester; distant seven miles north-west from Chiehester. Post-town, Emsworth. Bail- way \"station, Enisworth, distant about five miles. Union, West- bourne. Population in 1811, 489; in 1861, 633. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at \u00a3270 ; Patron, the Bishop of London ; Incumbent, Bev. Francis H. Vivian, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1675. Acreage, 5,422. Seats, Stanstead House, Mrs Dixon ; Watergate House, A. H. Hall, Esq. This is a border parish adjoining Warblington, in Hamp shire. The soil is chiefly chalk. The lofty range of the South Downs, called Bowhill, extends along the south-east boundary. Stoughton is not mentioned, eo nomine, in Domesday. In 1207, Roger Bigod, the last earl of Norfolk of that family, died seised. Iii 1557, it was purchased by Henry Fitz-Alan, and it became a favourite hunting resort of the Earls of Arundel. About 1480, Thomas, Lord Maltravers, rebuilt the manor-house. After wards it belonged to Lord Lumley, and subsequently to the Lewknors and Peacheys, Lords Selsey. It now belongs to the Hon. Mrs. Vernon Harcourt. The principal feature is Stan stead Park, which, with its forest, contains 1,666 acres, about 1,000 of which are in the parisb, while other portions extend into Racton and Warblington. The present house succeeds the earlier edifice, which was the seat of Lord Lumley, and in 1644, during the siege of Arundel, Sir Wilham Wader sent 2,000 horse and foot, and two drakes (small guns) to besiege it. The particulars of this attack are not known. It was probably much shattered, as about 1687, the mansion was again rebuilt by the Earl of Scarborough. It has since been much altered. It contains some good wood carving by Grinling Gibbons, and a suit of arras tapestry, representing the Battle of Wynendaal, brought from Flanders by the first Lord Scarborough. The forest lies, west of the bouse, and is divided by three wide avenues, of which the central one is two miles long. De Foe, in his \"Tour\" (1724), speaks thus of the place: \u2014 \"From Chiehester the road lying still west passes in view of the Earl of Scarborough's fine seat at Stanstead \u2014 a house seeming to be a retreat, being surrounded with thick woods, through which there are the most pleasant, agreeable vistas cut, that are to be seen anywhere in England \u2014 particularly because through the west opening, in front of the house, they sit in the dining-room, and see the town and harbour of Portsmouth, and the ships at Spithead and St. Helens, which, during war, is a most glorious sight.\" At a later period Stanstead was the seat of George Montague Dunk, Earl of Halifax, who left it to his illegitimate"], [509, "189 STREET. daughter, Anna Maria, who married Richard Archdall, Esq. By his lordship's trustees, the estate, with its demesnes and exten sive manors, was sold for \u00a3102,500, to Richard Barwell, Esq., after whose death it was sold to Lewis Way, Esq. Mr. Way, who resided here, took great interest in the conversion of the Jews to Christianity, and, in 1812, fitted up the north-west side of the old mansion as a chapel in the \"Gothic\" of the period, and had an ordained priest, a converted Jew, for religious minis trations on the episcopal system. This was succeeded by a new church (Christ Church), built and endowed by the late Charles Dixon, Esq., and consecrated in 1855. The living is a Perpetual Curacy, value \u00a3210, in the gift of Mrs. Dixon, and held by the Rev. Nicholas Grattan Whitestone, B.A. Stanstead received royal visits from King John, Queen Elizabeth, and the 1 st and 2nd Georges. Waldeeton, or Waldington, and Northwood, are hamlets of this parish. The church (St. Mary) is in the Early English style, with nave, chancel, and aisles ; but contains nothing of great impor tance. It had a chancel called St. Catherine's, and lights for the Holy Sepulchre and All Souls. There are three bells, one ancient, inscribed Ave gracia })lena. On the Downs there are several tumuli and earthworks, and tradition asserts that \u00c6delwalch, King of Sussex, and the exiled C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex, met here in battle, and further that the vanquished South-Saxon King lies buried in the southern bar row with his arms and his chieftains around him.

Street is a name given by our Saxon ancestors to the old Roman roads (vice stratce) which traversed England, and it has been conjectured that such a road passed through this parish ; but this is uncertain. The parish, like most of those in the Weald of Sussex, is long and narrow, its length from north to south being between four and five miles, while its breadth does not exceed half a mile. It extends from the chalk of the South Downs to the Wealden clay, and has a soil which is mostly fertile. There are many coppices and several woods. Near the church are two fine specimens of the quercus ilex, which is a rather rare tree in these parts. The manor of Street, which includes the greater part of the parish, is mentioned in Domesday as Estrat, and part of the possessions of Widiam de Warenne. Both before and after the Conquest it was valued at 100s. In 1192, it belonged to Geoffrey de Saye, in whose descendants it remained tid 1383, when it passed by marriage to the family of Fynes, subsequently Lords Dacre. Temp. Elizabeth it belonged to the Goring family, and later it was possessed by the family of Dobell, from whom it passed by marriage to the Lanes, the present owners. Street Place is a large handsome house, of the latter part ofthe reign of Elizabeth, and commands extensive views of the adja cent picturesque country. The principal front facing the east is 86 feet long, and has two projecting wings. The room on the first floor in the south wing of the front is paneled in oak, and has remains of numerous Latin mottoes. Mr. Blaauw sup poses it to have been the study of Walter Dobell, who died in 1625. One of his descendants, who joined the Cavalier party during the Civil Wars, is said to have contrived a place of con cealment in the house, the entrance to which was up the great hall chimney. There are several curious legends and traditions respecting this old mansion, which ceased to be the residence of the Dobells on tbeir acquisition of Folkington Place, and early in the eighteenth century Street Place became a farm house. Two \" small churches \" are mentioned in Domesday, but where the second stood is unknown. Street church consists of chancel, nave, north porch, north chancel, and a recently added south transept. The building, though much patched in later times, has doors and other features of Norman date. A turret over the west end contains one bell.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1555. Acre- age, 2,340. Seat, Sandgate Lodge, George Carew Gibson, Esq. Sullington lies partly on the South Downs, but the greater portion consists of arable land. Its length from north to south is 3\u00a3 miles, and its breadth f of a mile. The soil varies from chalk to sandy loam. Like Beeding, it has a detached portion in the forest district near Horsham, called Beoadbridge Heath, about twelve miles to the north, with a population, in 1861, of 86. From Domesday, Sillintone appears to have been among the smallest of manors, possessing only one villein with half a plough, and valued at 2s. ! Ulward held it of the Confessor, and Robert of Earl Roger de Montgomeri. Soon after the Conquest the family of Aguillon, or De Aquila, held it, and Richard de Aguillon's only daughter carried it by marriage to William de Covert, who had two knights' fees in Sullington and Broad bridge. Several disputes respecting game in this manor are recorded. In 1275, Hugh, son of Otho, brought an action against Roger de Covert, for unlawfully detaining a falcon valued at \u00a310, an immense price in those days; and in 1288, William de Braose prosecuted him for killing two hares in his free-warren in Washington and Findon. Roger pleaded that he had always hunted there for hares and foxes, and cut sticks in the woods to carry hares on. The manor house of this ancient sporting squire was valued at 3s. 4d. per annum. He had a park, two watermills, one windmill, and the advowson of the church. His descendants continued iu possession for several generations, till Baldwin de Covert,* in 1379, granted the re version of the manor, after his death, to Richard, Earl of Arundel, who gave it to his Hospital of the Holy Trinity at Arundel. * A very curious will of Margaret, wife of John de Covert, and mother of Bald win, 1361!, is in the possession of W. Smith Ellis Esq , of MHydecroft : it has been translated and printed in Cartwright's Rape of Bramber."], [512, "192 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. After the dissolution of that house, it passed through the fami lies of Lee, Shedey of Warminghurst, Apsley, and Shelley of Lewes. The manor-house close to the church has some traces of antiquity. The name ofthe Park is still retained by a portion of the estate, and two watermdls now exist, probably on the Domes day sites. (Cartwright, p. 122.) On the north-west side ofthe parish are two farms called Wantleys, which took their name from the family of De Wantele, before 1296, one of whom, John de Wantele, has a brass in Amberley church, dated 1424. In later times the famdies of Michell, Bennet, Standen, and Shelley have owned these lands. At Sandgate, near the centre of the parish, Sir George Warren, K.B., erected a cottage orne. After his death, Henry Shelley, Esq., enlarged it and made it his re sidence. It afterwards passed to the names of Anderson, Hill, and Bosanquet. In 1825, it was purchased by George John Gibson, Esq., who further enlarged it, and by subsequent altera tions, made it one of the most agreeable residences in Sussex. It is now the property and seat of George Carew C. Gibson, Esq., who in 1869 made additions which place it among the finest of Sussex mansions in Elizabethan architecture. The gentle family of Wase resided at Sullington in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The rectory and vicarage were formerly distinct, but they were united by Bishop Praty in 1441, on account of the poverty of the vicarage, which had prevented any priest from accepting it, and the service of the church had been neglected for twenty six years. The church (St. Mary) consists of a nave, chancel, north aisle, and low west tower, with a pyramidal cap. The nave has traces of Early English date, but the chancel is Deco rated. In the north aisle, Richard, Earl of Arundel, in 1389, founded a chantry, and gave the chapel of St. Martin in Arundel Castle for its support. In 37th Henry VIII. the incumbent, Thomas Sackville, \" a student at the gramer scole of thage of 13,\" had the endowment towards his exhibition \u00a33 16s. \u2014 a very young incumbent. Under the tower is a recumbent cross-legged effigy of a knight in armour, which was removed thither from the north aisle. Though much mutilated, it retains traces of excellent workmanship. It is of the time of Henry III., and is believed to represent William de Covert, lord of the manor. In 1 825, a stone with a cross fleury was dug up in the church-yard, and placed within the building. There are other memorials for the names of Goring, Dixon, Williams, &c. There is one bell dated 1522, and dedicated to the Trinity. In 1809, some tumuli were opened on Sullington Warren. They contained imperfect parts of urns and charcoal of the Celtic period. One perfect urn was exhumed. In 1812, several"], [513, "193 SUTTON. Roman warlike implements (spear-heads, swords, &c.) were found north of Sandgate. [S. A. C. Domesday mills, v, 272.

The village is situated on a pleasant elevation at the foot of a high range of tbe South Downs. In Saxon times five Thanes (they must have been very small ones) held it as a free manor. At the Conquest Robert held it of Earl Roger, and when the Earldom of Arundel came into possession of Queen Adeliza, it became as a part of her gift to her brother, Josceline of Louvaine, an appendage to the Honour of Petworth, and still so remains. By a roll of 26th Edward I., it appears that Peter de Sutton held ten librates here by the service of furnishing a sparrow hawk to the king, and Fulco Basset other lands by that of cer tain furred gloves (quasdem cirothecas griseo-furratas). The church (St. John) has a nave and chancel, north tran sept, south aisle, and porch, with Transition or Early English features, and a fine western tower. The chancel, which is De corated, has been restored. In the east window are the arms of Percy, Louvaine, and De Albini. The learned Hebraist, Julius Bate, was rector of this church in 1742 (\"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 336). Roman pottery has been found in this parish, and even within the church. [S. A. C.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1559. This parish, on the South Coast, possesses much local and historical interest, and it is fortunate in its learned Rector, the son-in-law of the immortal Southey, whose \" Seaboard and tbe Down,\" and \" Parochial Fragments \" contain a good deal of information relating to it, with more than has any immediate connection with this brief notice. The soil is a rich wheat- producing loam, with a substratum of marl, except towards the north, where it is more chalky. Ecclesiastically it has some pe- culiarities. Cartwright sums up the curious divisions which it possesses. The number of acres, he tells us, is 2,054, of which Tarring proper contains 624 ; Salvington, 390 ; Durrington aud Coate, 641 ; Heene, 397, exclusive of 20 acres of Down adjoin- ing Findon, called \" No-man's-land.\" The chapelries of Heene and Durrington maintain their own poor, and are for civil pur- poses in the Hundred of Brightford. Salvington is a bamlet. \u2014 The earliest account we have of the manor of Tarring is that King Athelstan gave it to the Church of Canterbury before the year 944, and the Domesday survey states that it had been imme morially subject to that see. In the reign of the Confessor, it was rated at 18 hides, nearly corresponding with present dimensions. There were 27 villeins, 14 cottars, two churches, and a wood of 6 hogs. It fluctuated in value between the Saxon and the * Except a few outlying lands in Horsham, Rusper, and Shipley. o 2"], [516, "196 HISTORY OF SUSSEX Norman rule from \u00a314 4s. to \u00a315. At the date of Domesday Widiam de Braose held four hides of the manor, and had three in demesne. According to the Hundred Rolls, 1274, the tenants of the Archbishop in Tarring and Salvington performed suits to the hundred of Brightford. In 1227 we have a curious list of the necessaries of life as assessed under a distraint of the Pri mate. A quarter of wheat was worth 18d. ; of oats, 8d; a yearling hog, 8d. ; a carcase of mutton, 4d. ; two good hens a penny, a good goose a penny ; and four gallons of good beer also a penny ! How the manor passed from the Archbishop to the Crown is not known. In 6th James I. it was chiefly held under a Crown lease for 70 years by Jane Dering. From 1620 to 1710 the family of Garway held it. It subsequently passed to the families of Tra vies and Barker. In 1796 the demesne lands, 281 acres, which are very fertile, were purchased by Thomas Henty, Esq. Mr. Henty brought the breed of Merino sheep to great perfection, and exported many of them to New South Wales. The inhabitants of Tarring were by ancient right excused from serving on juries on account of the service due to the Archbishop. In 24th Henry VI. \" the men of Terryng in the shyre of Sussex, upon the se banks dwelling,\" complained to the Lords in Council that their people had frequently been in jured in life and property by the incursions ofthe King's ene mies from France, Brittany and Spain. Two years afterwards the inhabitants obtained a charter for a weekly market on Saturdays, but this was of no long continuance. The original petition and charter are in the hands of the parish officers. (Cartwright.) The family of Hamper, which afterwards pro duced the late well-known antiquary William Hamper, Esq., F.S.A., of Birmingham, were long resident in Tarring. In 1582 George Hamper married Alice Selden, aunt to the idustrious John Selden, \" the glory of the English nation,\" as Grotius calls him. John Selden was born at Salvington in this parish in 1 584, and the parish register records his baptism on the 20th of December, as \" John the sonne of John Selden the minstred.\" The father, however, is described by Aubrey (\"Letters,\" Vol.ii.,p. 530) as \" a yeomanly man of about \u00a340 a year, who played well on the violin.\" Hence his description as a \" minstrel.\" This acquire ment brought him the favour and love of a gentlewoman, Mar garet, daughter of Thomas Baker, of Rustington, of the knightly family of that name in Kent. For a copious account of the eminent jurist, antiquary, and patriot, John Selden, see \"John son's Life of Selden,\" and \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 1\u201411. His birth-place is a small timbered house formerly caded Lacies, probably a fragment of a larger one. It bears the date 1601, to"], [517, "tarring, west. 197 indicate some repairs then made, for the original house must have been of earlier date. On the lintel of the low door inside is the following distich, said to have been carved by Selden him self when a boy of ten : \u2014 \" Gratus. honeste. mihi. non clatjdar. INITO. sedeqdb. Fur. abeas : non sum facta soluta, tibi.\" Which Mr. J. G. Nichols happily paraphrases \u2014 \" Welcome if honest ! Glad such men to greet, I will not close\u2014 walk in and take thy seat. Thief, get thee gone 1 'gainst theea stout defence, I open not, but boldly bid thee hence.\"* I strongly doubt the fact of Selden's having either composed or cut this inscription, as the letters are much too archaic for the assumed date. The Rectory-house, of which some remains exist, is supposed to stand on the site of the Archbishop's palace. This is doubted, but I believe the statement to be cor rect, as the chapel, 38 feet by 25, and the hall 40 feet by 20, remain, together with a range of buddings called Parsonage row. \" They are of the time of Henry VI. or Edward IV., and are among the most perfect specimens of ancient architecture in the Rape of Bramber.\" (Cartwright). Hither Thomas-a-Becket is said frequently to have resorted, and to have planted figs near the house. The fig orchard adjoining it was raised from some old stocks in the rectory garden. It was planted in 1745, and contains 100 trees, which produce about 2,000 dozen of the fruit annually. This is probably the largest plantation of figs in England. It is a curious fact that a bird resembling the Becca fico or fig-eater of Italy migrates hither during the fig season. The flocks remain five or six weeks, and then disappear as they came, seaward. The church (St. Andrew) is large and handsome, with chancel, nave with aisles, north porch, and west tower, supporting a lofty octangular shingled spire. The nave and aisles are Early Eng lish, the former very lofty with narrow clerestory windows. The chancel and tower are Perpendicular, the former having a large east window, a piscina, six oak stalls, some panneling and benches. (Hussey.) The building was thoroughly restored some years since at an expense of nearly \u00a33,000. The window under the tower is a memorial to Robert Southey, set up at the expense of his eldest daughter, the wife of the present vicar. In this church was formerly a chantry, dedicated to the Virgin, probably founded by one of the family of Atte Felde (who were very ancient in this and the neighbouring parishes) before the * \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" September, 1831."], [518, "198 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. year 1282. There are memorials in this fine church for the names of Negus, Coopper, Whitpaine, Brookbanks, Cooke, Stiles, Mitford, Whitebread, Jordan, Campion, Green, Haines, &c. There are six modern bells. The church chest contains the churchwardens' accounts from 1515 till 1579, and are full of curious entries. The Tarringites must have led a merry life occasionally, especially at their \" church-ales,\" when they feasted and drank right heartily. The bill of fare for 1562 contains among other items, \" 5 calvys, 8 lams, 4 sheype xxjs. iiijd., 5 bushels of malt, to cawfys hedes, ijd., a lygke of motton iiijd.,\" with pepper, saffron and other spices.

A very secluded South Down village, seldom visited except by huntsmen and lovers of racehorses. It is in a deep combe or valley, whence the termination. It is thought to be the \"Laneswice\" of Domesday, but it certainly bore the name of Titelescumbe in Saxon times. At the end of the reign of Elizabeth the manor belonged to Thomas, Lord Buckhurst, and after several changes it passed, in 1690, to Henry Shelley, Esq., of Lewes, to whose descendants, Henry and William D'Albiac, Esquires, it lately belonged. Robert Plumer, Esq., who held the manor farm of Courthouse in 1657, aliened it to Henry Smith, Esq., the founder of the well-known \" charity,\" and its proceeds are devoted to six parishes in Surrey. The Hoddern or Hothdown,"], [519, "199 THAKEHAM. farm, in this parish was, until the last century, a rabbit warren. Near the village is one of the \" Tyes,\" of frequent occurrence on and near the Downs. The church (St. Lawrence) was given with Southease, to the abbey of Hyde near Winchester, in the 10th century. It is a very small building, of chancel, nave, with north aisle and west tower, with a pyramidal cap. A north chancel, long since de stroyed, was rebuilt a few years since, during the renovation of the church, towards which the late William Cotton, Esq., was a great benefactor. The date is Transition-Norman. There are memorials for the names of Colley, Higgins, Crew, Povey, &c. Portobedo, a coast-guard station, is a kind of hamlet of Telscombe, and possesses nearly one-half of the population of the parish. [S. A. C. Bell, xvi, 226.

Acreage, i!,980. It is a parish of the very usual Sussex shape, much longer than it is broad. It is about five miles from south to north, and about three-quarters of a mile from west to east. There are two small detached portions of this parish, one called Muttons or Childe's farm, adjacent to Washington, and the other West Caltons, which is entirely surrounded by West Chiltington. In Domesday, Morice held the manor of William de Braose, Brixi having before held it of King Edward, as 20 hides, three roods. Afterwards it was reduced to five hides. There were 14 ploughlands, besides two in the demesne, 30 videins, and 12 cottagers, with eight ploughs. There were a church, a mid, and a wood of 60 hogs. \" A knight holds one hide of land, where he has five oxen with a bondman.\" Temp. Edward I., the manor was valued at \u00a314. It was held in 1270 by the ancient family of Le Poer or Power, when Stephen Poer died seised. \" His son or grandson,\" says Cartwright, \" died in 1352, leaving two daughters and coheirs, between whom the manor became divided. It is a singular circumstance that the lineal descendants of tjiese two daughters are, at present (1830),"], [520, "200 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. joint proprietors of the manor which has descended in two un interrupted lines, without any alienation, during the long period of 474 years.\" One moiety descended through the families of Apsley and Caldecot, to that of Shedey, of Lewes, now extinct; the other came through the Clothalls, Wilsheres, Bellinghams, Boys, and Lambs, to the Rev. Thomas Ferris. Thakeham Place, for merly the residence ofthe Apsleys, was acquired by the marriage of Stephen Apsley with Margaret, daughter of Stephen le Poer, in the 14th century. A modern house marks the site of the ancient mansion, which, about a century since, enclosed a quadrangle, with an entrance gateway, a chapel, and a great had. A spring of clear water, known as St. Mary's wed, exists near the site. From the two coheirs of Richard Caldecot, one portion of this property passed through several generations of the family of Butler, and it is now part of the settled estate of the Duke of Norfolk. The other moiety of the estate passed to the family of Newton of Southover, and was, a few years since, vested in their descendant, the late Mrs. W. Courthope Mabbott. Abingsworth, in the south part ofthe parish, formerly gave name to a now extinct family. It was for two centuries in the family of Medersh, and has descended through two heiresses to Edward Fuder Upperton, Esq. Campions was formerly a place of some importance, though now only a farm, and belonged to a branch of the Shelleys. Apsley or Apslee, on the north-east side of the parish, now also a farm, gave name to an influential family, who, as we have seen, inherited a moiety of the Le Poer estate in this parish. Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower, was des cended from a younger branch of this race, and was father of Lucy, wife of Colonel Hutchinson, and authoress of the well known \" Memoirs \" of her husband, who occupied a consider able position in the reigns of James 1. and Charles I. (\" Wor thies of Sussex,\" p. 156.) The church (according to Cartwright dedicated to St. Mary, but, as Mr. Gibbon says, St. Peter and St. Paul) is a picturesque building, of nave, chancel, and two transepts, with lancet win dows. The tower appears to be of the time of Henry VII. I have not visited this church, but a few years since it had screens dividing the chancel and the north transept, and benches indi cating that date. In the tower are five beds, the fourth of which has this distich : \u2014 \" I\" will be glad, and much reioyce on the, o God most hie, And make my songs extol thy name above the starrie side, 1748.\" There are many monumental inscriptions. On the floor there are brasses for \u0152Jomas Spslfg, son of William Apsley, Armiger, 1517, and for SSftUiapsleg, mother of William Apsley, Armiger,"], [521, "201 THAKEHAM. 1515. On an altar-tomb of Alabaster, is another brass for \u0152HdlS. aipslCB, Armiger, 1527. Another altar-tomb, without inscription, commemorates John Apsley, and Mary Lewknor his wife, the former of whom died in 1587. An altar- tomb of Sussex marble, despoiled of its brasses, is for Widiam, son and heir of John Apsley, Esquier, 1583. A much-defaced mural tablet of Caen stone bears the arms of the same family, but no inscrip tion, according to Cartwright's account. Stid another mural tablet remains for Edward, only son of Sir Edward Apsley, of Apsley, 1651. Altogether the mortuary memorials of this ancient family are most interesting. There are also tablets for the names and families of Butler, Shelley, Medersh, Butcher, Fuller, Lear, Banks, Hill, Widiamson, Milner, &c, &c. In 1351 King Edward III. confirmed to Stephen le Poer or Power, the grant of a messuage and 42 acres of arable, and pasture for two oxen in Thakeham, for the maintenance of a chantry in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin, in the churchyard of Thakeham.* In 1512 a dispute arose between William Apsley and Ralph Belhngham as to the right of patronage to this chantry, who both claimed to be equally descended from Stephen le Power, the founder. The Vicar-General declared that the gift should be alternate, and the chantry is described as \" Cantaria perpetua in capella Beat\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 Virginis in cemeterio ecclesi\u00e6 de Thacham.\" In the pleas of the Crown, 7th Edward I., it is averred that John le Suche (Zouche) rector of Chilting ton, came armed with his neighbours and dependents into a cer tain field called Rushfield in this parish, where Martin, rector of Thakeham, came with his men and a cart to codecs the tithes of the same field, and when Suche saw the aforesaid Martin, he assaulted him with an iron fork, and a tenant of his shot the said Martin in the right breast with an arrow. Another tenant attempted to kdl the poor rector as he lay upon the ground, with a hatchet ; whereupon the latter's servant struck the assad ant with a bundle of wood and slew him. A coroner's inquest fodowed, but with no result. Such battles of the \" church militant \" were not unfrequent in the middle ages. The names of the combatants and the witnesses are given by Cartwright, p. 251. [S. A. C. Apsley MSS. iv, 219. xii, 109. xiv, 224. Apsley pedigree, iv, 220. Domesday watermill, v, 272.

It is within the peculiar jurisdiction of Bosham, and the descent of the manor has been the same. After the Conquest it was held of the church of Bosham by one Malger. A priest is specially mentioned in Domesday. The church is a plain ancient building of rubble and stone, dedicated to St. Nicholas, the mariner's saint, and there is one medieval bell, inscribed \" Jhesus.\" Dallaway ascribes the edi fice to the time of Warlewast, Bishop of Exeter, founder of the College of Bosham, about 1120.

Ticehurst is \" the wood on the Tees,\" a little tributary of the Medway, which flows through part of the parish. The manor of Ticehurst does not appear in Domesday. In 23rd Edward I. William de Echingham held it, and in 35th of the same reign Edmund de Passeley, or Passeleu (Pashley) held lands here, and in 10th Edward II. Edmund de Passele, the same, or a descend ant, is described as lord. Two years earlier Alan de Buxhull is said to have held Tychehurst. The descent of the manor is very obscure. The names of Wanton, Ore, and others occur as pro prietors of lands. In 1600 Thomas Pelham obtained a grant of two fairs to be held here. In 16th George III. James Dalrymple, Esq., married the daughter and heiress of John Apsley, Esq., whose son, John Apsley Dalrymple, Esq., was lord of the manor under his grandfather's will. The true descent of the manor awaits investigation. This large parish possesses many points of interest. The vil lage is remarkably neat, and occupies a gentle eminence. It is surrounded by a pleasing undulated country. Hops are grown to a considerable extent. Pashley, a manor and estate in Ticehurst, gave name to the ancient family of Pashley, or Passeleu, which produced the well known Edmund de Passeleu, Baron of the Exchequer temp. Edward I. In the reign of Elizabeth it became the property of the family of May, from whom descended the Mays of Burwash (the poet's branch), and of Rawmere in West Sussex. The heiress of Thomas May, Esq., married the Rev. Richard Wetherell, and died in 1833. The mansion was built temp. James I. It has the date of 1612, and contains some excellent oak carving of that date. It was formerly moated. Borezell is a moated manor house of considerable antiquity, and was for many descents the estate of the family of Roberts, descended from the ancient house of that name, at Glassenbury, in Kent. It is now the property of George Burrow Gregory, Esq., M.P. The family of Newington are of long standing in Ticehurst. They are de scended from Sir Adam Newington, of Withern den in this parish, Knight, who was living in 1481, and the estate, until lately, re mained in their possession. They have still excellent property in the parish. The family have been for several generations famed for their medical skill, and the late Mr. Newington, sen., of Vineyards, founded an establishment for the recep tion of lunatics of the higher class. His son, Mr. Charles Newington, much enlarged the original plan, and at High-"], [524, "204 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. lands erected a splendid series of ornamental buildings on a commanding and beautiful site, about half a mde from the village. The Chinese Gallery is a large building for in door promenades, and there are spacious grounds, occupying 200 acres, with carriage-drives, walks, plantations, cricket and archery grounds, billiard-rooms, a museum, fountains, aviaries, conservatories, and a handsome chapel. This is one of the finest establishments in the kingdom for the nervous and insane, and the kind and humane treatment which the unfortu nate inmates receive tends much to relieve their sufferings. (See memoir of Charles Newington in the \" Worthies of Sussex,\" 254). The establishment is now the property and under the care of his son, Dr. Samuel Newington. \u2014 Whiligh, an ancient manor, formerly held by the families of Pashley, Warde, Shoys wed, and Sanders, came into the possession of John Courthope, Esq., in 1512, from whom it has descended to George Campion Courthope, Esq., the present proprietor. Whiligh is a large structure of brick, surrounded by fine trees in the centre of an extensive park, and lies about three miles from the vidage. There are several other excellent residences, villas, &c, in the parish. Ticehurst gave name to a family now widely spread in the middle and lower classes of society. The church (St. Mary) consists of a nave, with aisles, a chancel, flanked with two chantry or manorial chapels, each having a piscina, and a tower with shingled spire. There are six beds, dated 1771, with doggerel verses on each. On the north side of the porch are the arms of Echingham. In the windows are some remains of ancient painted glass. There is a brass for 3Jo^n SH2aj}tamc, Esq., and his two wives, Edith and Agnes, date 1490 ; and there are interesting memorials for the Courthopes of Whiligh, the Mays of Pashley, the Robertses ofBorezell, and the Newingtons of Withernden, and references to the names of Rivers, Elliot, Hollist, Scafe, Busbridge, Apsley, and many others. Over the porch is a parvise, or upper chamber, with a grated window, supposed to have been a manorial prison.

In 1760, Widiam Mitford, Esq., descended from the great northern family of Mitford Castle, co. Northumberland, began the erection of the mansion called Pitts Hill, which was completed by his son in 1794. The site is remarkable for great natural beauty, and the appliances of art have rendered it a charming residence. The church of Allhadows has portions in the Decorated style. It consists of a chancel, and a nave and south aisle, separated by a low arcade, the capitals of which are of the early part of the 14th century. The light and lofty tower finished with flying arches, crossed in the centre, was erected in 1807 at the expense of the late Earl of Egremont (Dallaway). The inscriptions in the church are interesting, and comprise the names of Spencer (1593), Milward, Rowe, Mitford, and Capron, and of Dr. William Cox, a controversial rector, 1658 (see \"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 340).

Population in 1811, 78 ; in 1861, 112. Benefice, a Vicarage, valued at \u00a3175 ; Patron, the Duke of Norfolk ; Incumbent, Eev. E. F. Tompkins. B.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1560. Acreage, 1,131. Chief Landowners, the Duke of Norfolk and J. Montefiore, Esq. Tortington lies partly on the alluvium of the Arun, which river forms its eastern boundary. On tbe north, towards Arundel Park, there is considerable woodland. Tbe manor was held in Saxon times by one Lewin, a free man, and was assessed at 4 hides. After the Conquest, Ernucion held it of Earl Roger de Montgomeri at 3 hides. There were 6 villeins, 2 cottars, ancl a wood of 6 hogs. In 1210 the Prior of Tortington was rated at 2 knights' fees, which he held by the service of defending Arun del Castle for forty days, during the time of siege. In 1244 John Fitz-Alan obtained it, and annexed it to his demesne of Arundel. A subsequent member of the Arundel family, in 9th Elizabeth, sold it to John Apsley, Esq., who transferred it to Roger Gratwicke, Esq., who built the manor-house called Tor tington Place. It afterwards passed through the famihes of Weekes and Leeves into the hands of Charles, Duke of Norfolk, in whose noble descendant it still vests. Pedigrees of the Grat wicke and Leeves families are given by Dallaway (\"Rape of Arundel,\" page 83). The Priory of Tortington stood on the banks of the river, about lj mile below Arundel, and its existing remains are con fined to some walls in a barn near the farm-house of Tortington. This Priory of Augustinian canons, which Was dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen, was founded by the Lady Hadvisia Corbet, who is conjectured to have been of the D'Albini family; but of this lady's history and the exact date of the foundation little is known. The Priory was in existence temp. King John, and it was probably dependent upon the Abbey of Seez in Normandy. Its revenues were mainly derived from lands in West Sussex, and the Prior had an \" inn \" or town house in the parish of St."], [527, "207 TREYFORD. Swithin, in London. Few and simple are the annals of this small establishment, and, like others of its class, it was in a state of poverty down to the date of the Dissolution, when the revenues were valued at only \u00a3101 4s. Id. The establishment was evidently badly conducted, for in 1478 the Prior was accused of idolatry by adoring the bread and wine, and by placing rehcs of the saints on the altar, wherefrom arose unseemly strife. The church is very small, ancl has only chancel and nave, with a wooden bell-cot over the west end, and south porch. It was formerly larger, and probably cruciform in arrangement. It has Norman features, and some which are probably Early Eng lish. There is some early painted glass. The building has been much patched. There is a brass plate for Montr \u00a9rattoife, lord of the manor of Tortington-Cheneys, 1596, and another inscrip tion for the names of Lister, &c. There is one bell. [S. A. C.

William Downes Willis, M.A., of Sidney Sussex-College, Cambridge. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1728. The whole parish, consisting of 1,260 acres, belongs to the Hon. Mrs. Vernon Harcourt. It is a long and narrow parish, and the village stands on a slope of the South Downs. On the top of Treyford hill is a line of five lofty barrows, called \" Devil's Jumps.\" The manor was held, before the Conquest, by Alard, of Earl Godwin ; afterwards of Earl Roger, by Robert Fitz-Tebald. In the 16th century, and probably earlier, it was held by the Aylwins, a family of great antiquity in this district. They continued in possession until 1772, when Robert Aylwin, the last male ofthe elder line, died, leaving two daughters and co-heiresses, Mary, married to Charles Talbot, second son of George, Earl of Shrewsbury, and Elizabeth, wife of Sir William Mannock, Bart. They sold it to Sir James Peachey, Bart., whose descendant, Henry John, third Lord Selsey, dying without issue in 1838, the property passed to his only sister, tbe Hon. Mrs. Vernon Harcourt. The name of Aylwin is still subsisting in younger branches, chiefly farmers,"], [528, "208 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. in this and the adjacent parishes. The ancient manor-house of the Aylwins, which has some remarkably fine brickwork, still remains. The old church (St. Mary) was superseded by a new one, dedicated to St. Peter, which was consecrated in 1849, having been built at the charge of the patrons, the Rev. L. Vernon Harcourt, and the Hon. Mrs. Vernon Harcourt. It is from designs by Ferry, and consists of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, with a tower and spire at the north-west angle. The style is Decorated, and the workmanship excellent. The spire, reaching the height of 120 feet, is a conspicuous ornament to the landscape. This church affords accommodation to the two affiliated parishes of Elstead and Didling. [S. A. C. Domesday watermill, v, 272. Church, xii, 79. Bell, xvi, 226. Eiver Bother, xvii, 259.] TROTTON. Domesday, Traitune; a parish in the Hundred of Dumpford ; Eape of Chiehester ; distant four miles west from Midhurst ; Post-town, Petersfield, which is also its Eailway station, distant about six miles. Union, Midhurst. Population in 1811, 370; in 1861, 452. Benefice, a Bectory, valued at \u00a3296 ; Patron and Incumbent, Eev. Edward William Batchellor, B. A., of Christ Church, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1581. Acreage, 3,877. Like many parishes in this district, Trotton is much dis proportioned in its length and breadth, the former being from south to north nearly seven miles, while the latter averages but f of a mde. The village is situated on a fertile soil, near the north bank of the Western Rother. The scenery in many parts is rich and picturesque. The manor was held in Saxon times by the Countess Gocla of the King. At the date of Domesday it had a church and a mill, and formed part of the vast estate of Earl Roger de Montgomeri. In the reign of Edward I. it was held by military tenure by Sir Ralph Camoys, who gave it the name of Camoys Court. His distinguished descendants, the Barons Camoys, became extinct in the male line in the 15th century, when Trotton passed, by a co-heiress, to the Lewknor family. The male issue of this branch failed in 1520, and a co heiress conveyed it to the family of Mdle, at a later period Baronets, who held it for several generations. In 1723 it belonged to Alcocke, in 1834 to Twyford, afterwards to Mowatt, and it is now in the possession of Reginald Henry Nevill, Esq. Dumpfokd, in this parish, gives name to the Hundred ; and the chapelry of Millakd, in a remote part of the parish, has a"], [529, "209 TROTTON. chapel (St. Luke) called, in the 16th century, \" the chappiU of Tuck's-hythe.\"* The church (St. George) was re-built towards the year 1400, by Thomas, Lord Camoys, K.G., who also erected the bridge over the Rother. It consists of a nave and chancel, under one roof, and tower, with shingled spire. It contains an interesting brass, unfortunately much mutilated, for the Lady JHUirgarct (ftaittOJJS, 1310 (perhaps the earliest for a lady in England), and a magnificent table-tomb with canopied brasses for djomas, StSaroit (tfamogS, and Elizabeth, his wife, the widow of Henry (Hotspur) Percy, and the \" Gentle Kate \" of Shakspeare (1419). There are likewise three table-tombs, of which the inscriptions are almost erased, but one of then seems to commemorate the family of Forster. There are later memorials for the families of Alcocke, Aylwin, Twyford, &c. At the rectory-house in this parish, was born, in 1651, Thomas Otway, the greatest tragic poet, next to Shakspeare, whom the English tongue has known. At the time of his birth, his father, Humphrey Otway, was curate of Trotton, and afterwards rector of Woolbeding. For memoirs of this man of genius, whose rugged and troublous life and wretched death were in them selves a tragedy, see \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 203. William Joliffe, Esq., a short time since resident at Trotton, has paid a tribute to the poet's memory by a Latin inscription on a brass plate in the church. Trotton Bridge of five arches spans the Rother, and is unques tionably the finest bridge in Sussex. The arches are supported by ribs, and the whole structure, which is of the stone of the country, is eminently picturesque. A local tradition asserts that it cost Lord Camoys only a few pence less than the church, which is extremely probable. At Trotton Place, close to the church-yard, a mansion of the time of Queen Anne, with recent additions, resides Arthur Edward Knox, Esq. (lessee) the accomplished author of \" Orni thological Rambles in Sussex,\" and other works on similar subjects. The house, doubtless, represents the site of the manor house, though the old Camoys Court, or Castle, I think, from inspection, must have stood on a hillock to the south-east of the church, near which traces of old foundations are- frequently turned up.

The population now probably exceeds 12,000. It has a railway station on a branch of the South- Eastern line, and hes about 32 miles from London and five miles south of \" Tunbridge town.\" This now wed-known place was, two centuries and a half since, for the most part a heathy plain, interspersed with rocks, till, in 1606, Dudley, Lord North, then on a visit at Eridge, the seat of Lord Abergavenny, discovered the valuable chalybeate spring emanating from a bed of secon dary iron ore, and having drunk the waters of it found great benefit from them. The Earl of Abergavenny enclosed the spring, and made improvements for the attraction of visitors. The scheme was successful, and in 1630 Queen Henrietta came hither with a large retinue, but was obliged to encamp on the down for want of house accommodation. For many years after this the visitors, during the summer season, were literally \" dwellers in tents,\" or had to resort for lodging to Southborough and other places. Catharine of Braganza, Queen of Charles IL, admired the spot, which soon became a fashionable watering place, but it was not until such men as Cibber, Dr. Johnson, Garrick, Richardson, &c, a century later, patronized the place that it acquired a wide renown. The original spring still remains open, and is surrounded by modern erections. The articles of inlaid wood for boxes, toys, &c, known as \" Tunbridge ware,\" have long been manufactured here. The scenery is everywhere pleasing and romantic, and one hardly knows whether to call Tunbridge Wells an urbs in rure or a rus in urbe, so delightfully mixed up are its houses, commons, green glades, and sandstone rocks. The \" high rocks\" are most interesting. In a valley close to Rusthall Common, about a mile distant, is another group of rocks very remarkably shaped, and one of them, the most singular in the group, is known as the \" Toad Rock.\" The living is a perpetual curacy, and the old chapel of ease, originally built in the seventeenth century, is dedicated to St. Charles the Martyr ! Christ Church and Trinity are modern succursales, and there are other places of worship for nearly every denomination. Public institutions of many kinds are abundant. The undulating character of the country gives rise to several rather curious designations, as Mount Ephraim, Mount Sion, Mount Pleasant, and Bishop's Down. Calverley Park is another pleasant spot.

It was anciently a portion of the great parish of Buxted, but it has been dismembered for civil and ecclesiastical purposes for a considerable length of time. The Rev. Edward Turner's ac count of the parish is full of interest as to its ancient history. (\" Sussex Collections,\" vol. xii.) That gentleman justly observes that \" this place has become singularly modern \u2014 -almost every thing of antiquarian value about it having of late years fast disappeared.\" The church (formerly chapel) of Uckfield is a recent building for the most part, though a few ancient fea tures have been retained. The Tudoresque old bridge of three arches, which spanned the Uckfield branch of the Ouse, has given way to a railway bridge of no picturesque interest. Madame d'Arblay, so long ago as 1779, could not discover any thing of interest in Uckfield, when she visited it with Mrs. Thrale, en route from Tunbridge Wells to Brighton. The name of the parish is probably derived from the oak tree, though this etymology has been doubted, as this is not an oak growing district. Perhaps some remarkable oak stood here. Ashcombe is not celebrated for its ash trees, nor Thornhill for its thorns, nor Appledore for its apple-trees ; but among our Saxon ancestors it was quite customary to name a place from some individual tree, and, upon the lucus a non lucendo principle, the rarer a particular tree was, the more likely it was to confer its name on the locality. The medieval spelling of the name is Okenfeld or Okyngfeld. The parish, or rather chapelry, does not appear in Domesday, and the earliest record we have of it is, according to Mr. Turner, 1291 (\" Pope Nicholas's Taxation\"), though he thinks a church existed here nearly a century earlier than that date. In 1299 King Edward I., on a \"progress\" from Canterbury to Chiehester, staid at Uckfield for one night. His retinue must have been large, for be had to purchase a great deal of beer. The entry in the record is : \"To the clerk of the pantry for 82 gallons of beer, bought from Arnald de Uckfield, at Uckfield, 23rd June, 10s.\" The roads were no doubt dusty, and the suite thirsty after their ride. The old church, dedicated to the Holy Cross, had features of Perpendicular, Decorated, and probably earlier styles. It being in a state of dilapidation, and inadequate to the population, it was taken down in 1839. There are memorials for the families and names of Wilson, Courthope, Egles, Goring, Streatfeild, Ogle, Ellis, ancl Fuller. The last mentioned has a brass of a male figure, and bears the date of '1610, and a record of his benefaction to several parishes, of which Uckfield is one. The"], [534, "214 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. gift consisted of 10s. per annum, and the fodowing doggerel stanza is placed on the tomb : \u2014 \" Now I am dead and layd in grave, And that my bones are rotten, By this shall I remember'd be, Or else I am forgotten.\" A gentleman having read this epitaph gave the following impromptu : \u2014 \" 0, traveller, stop I for tho' his bones be rotten, Fuller rests here, and must not be forgotten : For lo, he gave ten shillings that his name Might live for ever on the scroll of fame 1\" This John Fuller, gentleman, whose family were settled here for three generations, was ancestor of the Fullers, a family of great importance, who settled at Waldron, at Lewes, and several other places in East Sussex, and ultimately at Rose Hid, in Brightling, and were amongst the chief iron-masters of the county. The tower contains eight bells of no great antiquity, but with quaint inscriptions. Opposite the King's Head Inn is an apartment of stone with several recessed arches in the wall. It is now occupied by a baker. There is a tradition that this was formerly a prison cell, and that Richard Woodman, the well-known Protestant Martyr, was once confined in it during the Marian persecution ; which is quite probable, as that brave man was born at Buxted, close by, and he speaks of one Goodman Day, of Uckfield, in his ex amination. A free school was founded in or about 1690 by Dr. Anthony Saunders, rector of Buxted. By his will, dated 1718, he pro vided for the education of twelve boys, six belonging to the parish of Buxted and six to Uckfield. He left his library, which consists of several hundred volumes of theology and classics, to this charity, which has been extended to twenty-four boys. The school-house stands in Church Street. Here in former years several wed-known Sussex men, among whom was Dr. Edward Daniel Clarke, the celebrated traveller, received their prelimin ary education. It may be mentioned that another learned English writer, Jeremiah Markland, resided at Uckfield in the middle of the last century. The town is, as I have said, delightfully situated. The High Street is particularly neat, and is flanked by several excedent residences ; but the great picturesque beauty of the place is the Lake close to the mansion called the Rocks. It is nearly sur rounded by sandstone cliffs overhanging the water, from twenty to thirty feet high. Among their crevices trees grow luxuriantly, and in the lake there is an island covered with shrubs and trees."], [535, "UDIMORE. 215 Uckfield may be regarded as a kind of head quarters for as tronomical science in the county.

This parish, which lies chiefly on upland ground, is bounded on the south by the Brede channel. In the fourteenth century it suffered much from inundations on its lower side. Dodimore is described in Domesday as in the hundred of Babinreode which most probably corresponds, or nearly so, with the modern hun- dred of Gostrow. Reinbert held it of the Earl of Eu. Before the Conquest, Algar (a name still existing in East Sussex) held it of Godwin, father of Harold.- It was always held as six hides. There was a church, and the manor was valued at eight pounds. In 23rd Edward I. William, Lord Echingham, obtained free- warren for his manor of Odymere. In his descendants it vested until temp. Henry VI. In 1478, John Ellington obtained an- other grant of free-warren, for Udimere, and to enclose a park and fortify his mansion. Temp. Elizabeth, Henry, Lord Windsor, was lord. Later still, it passed to the Burdets and Bromfields, who held it of the family of Pelham, as of their castle and honour of Hastings. In 1717, Spencer Compton was lord, and it descended to the Cavendish family. Among the principal old houses in the parish were or are \u2014 Parsonage Place, once the abode of a branch of the Coopers of Icklesham; Knellstone,"], [536, "216 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. the residence of the family of Frebody, who were here for many generations; Hammonds (the Woodhams family); and Jordans, which was the home of a gentle family bearing that name. The old manor-house of the Bromfields stood to the south of the church-yard. Thomas Bromfield, Esq., who died in 1690, is supposed to have been the last of that family resident in Udimore. A detached portion of the parish known as Little Udimore is surrounded by Sedlescombe and Brede. By the Reform Act of 1832, the whole parish was annexed for electoral purposes to the borough of Rye. The church (St. Mary), though small, is ancient (Horsfield sajTs Early English), and has a chancel, nave, and a tower con taining three bells. There was formerly a south aisle. The chancel contained, in 1835, no less than nine lancet windows. (Horsfield.) There are monuments or inscriptions for the fami lies of Jordan, Frebody, Burdet, Cooper, Woodhams, &c. This church was anciently appropriated to the Abbey of Roberts bridge. A curious legend to the effect that Udimore derives its name from a circumstance connected with the building of this edifice is remembered by old inhabitants. The parishioners began to build themselves a church on the opposite side of the little river Eee, to that on which it was even tually reared. Night after night, however, witnessed the dislocation of huge stones from the walls built on the preceding day, and the pious work bade fair to be interminable. Grave suspicious arose among the parishioners that they had selected an unholy, and consequently, an im proper, site for the building, and these were eventually confirmed. Un seen hands hurled the stones to the opposite side of the stream, and an awful supernatural voice in the air uttered, in warning and reproachful tones, the words \" O'er the mere; o'er the mere;\" thus at once indicating a more appropriate situation for the sacred edifice, and by anticipation conferring a name upon it, for the transformation of the phrase \" O'er the mere,\" into Udimore, was no great difficulty.* The following hexameters are inscribed in the parish regis ter : \u2014 '\u25a0' Udimer infelix I nimis est cui Presbyter unus ; Presbyter infelix 1 cui non satis Udimer una ; Impropriator habet Cleroqu\u00e6 propria durus, Atque alter proprios Clerus peregrinus et hospes ; Ex decimis decimis fruitur lege sacerdos.

Hall, Esq., of Water- gate House. The group of villages called \" the Mardens \" lies on the Downs, and its derivation from the Saxon mor, a waste heathy land, and dun, a hill, answers to the geographical position and ancient state. Domesday mentions four Merduns, and although four stid exist, it would be difficult in each instance to appropriate description to locality. One was held in Saxon times by Aldwin, and Alaric ; another by Lepsi, of Gida, the countess of Earl Godwin ; the third by Alwin, of the Confessor ; and the fourth by Earl Godwin. After the Conquest, Earl Roger held them all. Upmarden has belonged at different periods to the Fitz- Alan family, to John, Lord Lumley, the Pages, and the Peck hams, and has from the last-named passed as Compton. West Marden is a hamlet in this parish : its chapel was de stroyed long since. The mansion of Watergate was built by William Drury (who was afterwards a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I.) before the year 1609, and continued in his descendants for several generations. It is now the property of Alexander H. Hall, Esq. The Church (St. Michael) is small and ancient. Rickman (1848) considers the wall-plate of the building to represent an example of the Early English style, with the tooth moulding. There are memorials for the names of Thomas, Phipps, Peck ham, &c.

In 1776 it was pur chased of the family of Luther (who inherited from that ancient race) by the late Lord Egremont, and added to the Petworth estate. The church is a smad building of nave and chancel, with a dovecot spire.

The manor is not mentioned in Domesday, but it has long been held of the Honour of Petworth. Of the history of this \" Castle,\" little or nothing is known. Several traditional stories as to its original use have been current, without the slightest foundation. I believe, with the Rev. Edward Turner, that it was simply a hunting-tower, attached to some lordship, probably that of the De Bohuns. Some fragments of the walls were standing in Sir William Burrell's time, and a drawing of them with a ground plan (1770) is preserved among his MSS. Two or three of the window openings were in the Early English style. There was formerly a wood caded Verdley Park, which contained 250 acres, and the early maps of Sussex represent the tower as surrounded by a park pale. The dimensions of the castle were 68 by 33 feet, and"], [539, "219 WAUHUEST. the walls were nearly six feet in thickness.

Seat, Wadhurst Castle is the residence of Edward Watson Smyth, Esq. The name of this parish seems to be derived from the Anglo- Saxon wad, a ford, and hurst, a wood \u2014 \" the ford by the wood.\" The parish is divided into six \" quarters,\" viz. : Town-quarter, Cousey-Wood-quarter, Bivelham-quarter, Faircrouch-quarter, Reseden-quarter, and Weeke-quarter. The surface is hilly, and the soil varies considerably. The scenery is pleasingly diversi fied with woodland and hop-gardens. The soil is ferruginous, and hence the iron manufacture was largely carried on here. It may be mentioned that the iron-masters of this and the neigh bouring parishes, and their connections were interred beneath cast-iron slabs. The passages of the nave and aisles of the church are almost covered with these slabs, with rude inscrip tions and armorial bearings. They are no less than 30 in num ber, ranging between the years 1625 and 1799. High-Town belonged, in or before the reign of Henry VIII., to the family of Maunser, and so continued for many genera tions. It then passed to the Newingtons, and subsequently to the Bakers of Mayfield. Faircrouch was an ancient stone man sion, but fell to dilapidation nearly two centuries since. The famdy of Whitfeld, formerly of Alstonmoor, in Cumberland, were once considerable proprietors here, and their descendants still survive in Sussex and Kent. A coheiress conveyed the estate to the family of Ballard. The Dunmolls also had good lands in the parish, which descended, through female lines, to the families of Mercer and Durrant. The family of Fowle, who built in 1591, the fine mansion of Riverhall, were great iron masters. The house still retains traces of its original grandeur, but the family has faden to decay. The famdy of Barham, also"], [540, "220 HISTORY OF SUSSEX iron-founders, are said to have been descended from Robert de Berharu, son of Richard Fitz-Urse, and brother of the assassin of Thomas a Becket. They lived at Great Butts, and about 1630 John Barham, Esq., erected or re-built the spacious mansion of Shoesmiths. David Barham built the greater portion of the present house of Snape about 1617. The family fed into decay, and their present representative is a wheelwright at Wadhurst. Of this family was the celebrated lawyer, Nicholas Barham, Queen's Sergeant, temp. Elizabeth. The church (St. Peter and St. Paul) is partly in the Early English and partly in later styles of architecture. It consists of a chancel, nave, with aisles, and tower with a lofty shingled spire, and a musical peal of six bells. There are inscriptions and mural tablets to the memory of the families and names of Whitfeld,* Barham, Dunmoll, Tapsell, Legas, Comber, Porter, Colepeper, Alcorn, Aynscombe, Newington, Willett, Davison, Burgis, Courthope, Salmon, &c. Tidebeooe is a hamlet 2| miles south-west from Wadhurst. In 1856 a district church (St. John the Baptist) was erected here. It is a perpetual curacy, value \u00a353 per annum. It is in the alternate gift of the vicars of Wadhurst and Mayfield ; the present incumbent is the Rev. Albert J. Roberts, M.A., of St. John's College, Oxford.

Dallaway derives the name of this parish from the Anglo- Saxon w\u00e6l-burg-tun, \" demonstrative of a military station.\" The manor appears to have been connected with the lordship of Hal naker. In the time of the Confessor it was held by three free men, ancl was rated at 11 hides and two virgates. There were, at the making of Domesday, a church, six serfs, and a wood of four hogs. The manor, when detached from the earldom of Arundel, passed through the families of St. John, Poynings, Bonville, and Paulet. It belonged subsequently to those of Racton and Bennet. Before 168 7 Thomas Nash, gentleman, purchased the manorial estate, and his descendants enjoyed it for several generations. In 1800 Gawen Richard Nash, Esq., sold it to General John Whyte, whose son, in 1817, sold it to Richard Prime, Esq. The mansion was pulled down and re-budt on a larger scale by Mr. Prime. Walberton House has been characterized as \" a handsome mansion, with a beautiful and costly hall, staircase, and library.\" The architect was Sir Robert Smirke. Avisford Place, associated with the name of the hun dred in wliich Walberton lies, is an elegant residence. The site is elevated, and commands an interesting sea view. This estate belonged some years since to Admiral Sir George Montagu, G.C.B., who sold it to General Sir Wm.Houston, G.C.B. A remark able arch\u00e6ological discovery was made on this estate in 1817. There were many fictile and glass vessels of the Roman period, most of which had been deposited in a stone cist or coffer, four feet in length. The Romans, no doubt, occupied the whole ofthe Sussex coast, and left many of their vestigia, but, alas, where shad we find from inscription or votive altar what particular Roman colonist it was who lived at Walberton ! The church (Our Lady) has a large chancel, a nave, and two aisles, with a shingled turret containing three bells. Many coarse patchings appear to have been made since the period of the Reformation. Sir George West of Halnaker was buried here in 1538, but no memorial remains. There are inscriptions for the names of Nash (Gawen Nash, merchant, is described as \" a great benefactor to this church and parish,\" ob. 1749), Rowe, Pette, Dorset, Whyte, &c.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1564. Acreage, 6,218. Chief Landowners, Louis Huth, Esq., and Fuller-Meyrick, Esq. This is a beautifully undulated parish, in a picturesque part ofthe Weald, whence its name, Anglo-Saxon waid, a wood, and the views from various parts are very striking, especially that from the church-yard. In the last generation Waldron was almost a by-word for rusticity and lack of civilization. Now it is favoured with the presence of several persons of influence and wealth, who have entirely changed its character. Several excellent residences have sprung up, and among these may be named those of J. G. Boucher, Esq., R. H. Stainbank, Esq., and especially Possingworth (vulgo, Possingfoord), the magnificent seat of Louis Huth, Esq. It is one of tbe grandest mansions in the South of England, and cost more than \u00a360,000. It is from designs by Mr. Digby Wyatt, and contains every appliance of luxury and taste, including a fine picture gallery and noble con servatories. Seams of coal, or fibrous lignite, with the appear ance of jet, and with a velvet-like smoothness, occur in the geo logical strata of the parish. In the time of Edward the Confessor, \u00c6lveva held a part of Waldrene, as allodial or free land. At the date of Domesday, Ansfrid held it of the Earl of Moreton. The principal manor in the parish, in later times, was that of Herringdales, alias Wal dron. The manors of Laughton, Chiddingly, and Isenhurst also extend into it, and other manors, existing or reputed, are Fox hunt (formerly belonging to Robertsbridge Abbey), Possing worth, Tanners, and Horeham. In vol. xiu. of \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" the Rev."], [543, "WALDRON. 223 John Ley, Rector, has printed an excellent paper on the church, the manors, and the old mansions of the parish, a very brief precis of which is here given. To begin with the church of All Saints, sometimes written All Hallows, it consists of chancel, nave, north aisle with porch, and a low battlemented western tower, in the Perpendicular style, containing eight musical bells. The nave has Decorated inser tions, and the chancel is Early English. A marble slab on the floor, incised with five crosses, was doubtless the original altar stone. The east window is peculiar, and ofthe period from the Transition to the Perpendicular style. It formerly had, in painted glass, a man hi armour kneeling, with the legend, iptaj) sot tfje SOUl Of _5of)lt IJelijam, who probably built the tower of this church as well as those of many others in the neighbourhood. About temp. Henry II. Robert de Dene gave the tithes of this rectory to the Priory of Lewes, and his descendant, Sybilla de Icklesham, by license of the date of 1233, built a chapel for her own use in her manor-house of Walderne. Her husband was Nicholas Harengod, or Heringaud, from whom, doubtless, the manor received its now corrupted name of Herringdales. The church contains many memorials to the names of Courthope, Fuller, Dalrymple, Dyke, Offley, Lewis, &c, with many hatch ments of some or other of these families. In one of the windows are the arms of Pelham. In times soon after the Conquest, Waldron was almost in a state of forest, and so continued for some centuries. So lately as 1842, when the tithes were commuted, 2,000 acres, or nearly a third of the whole parish, were regarded as tithe-free, as being woodland, or yet uncultivated, though this was not literally the case. The names Walderne, Foxhunt, the Dern, &c, all refer to a period when the place formed a portion of the Forest of Ande rida, the great Weald of Sussex. Foxhunt belonged, in 1327, to Sir Ralph de Camoys. In the next century it vested in the Brownes of Betchworth Castle, ancestors of the Viscounts Mon tague ; afterwards in the families of Threele, Pelham, Smith, and Gilliat. Heringauds, or Herringdales manor-house, where Sybdla's chapel existed, stood a little westward of the church, within a circular moat of 150 feet diameter, with embankments around it. From this family it passed to those of De Poynings, Browne (Viscount Montague), Fawkenor, Middleton, Pelham, and Smith. Possingworth manor was owned by a family who derived their name from it. John, son of Lawrence de Possynge werse, demised it in the fourteenth century to the Heringauds, and after many changes of proprietorship, it became vested in the Abbot and Convent of Robertsbridge, who held it until the Dissolution. At later dates it passed, through the Sidneys and Pelhams, to the great London-merchant family of Ofiley, one of"], [544, "224 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. whom, a Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Offley, temp. Elizabeth, left half his estate (\u00a35000) to the poor, and was thence called the London Zacch\u00e6us. He was remarkable for his abstemiousness, and it was said of him (as mentioned in Fuller's \" Worthies\") \u2014 \" Offley three dishes had of daily roast, An egg, an apple, and, the third, a toast.\" It is worthy of remark, that a much earlier Lord Mayor had been associated with this parish, namely, Sir William, son of Geoffrey de Walderne, of Walderne, who held the chief magistracy of the city in 1412 and 1422. The first of the Offley s who possessed Possingworth was probably Humphrey Offley, who died in 1643. His son Thomas built, or rebuilt, Possingworth House, which bears date 1657, and the initials T. 0. Subsequently the estate passed through Fuller, Apsley, Dalrymple, and Thomas (or Tre herne) to the present owner. A considerable portion of the mansion still remains, and is figured in vol. xiii. of \" Sussex Ar ch\u00e6ological Collections,\" p. 80. Tanners, or Tanhouse, was another mansion in the parish, which passed through the Syd neys and Sackvilles to the family of Fuller, ancestors of the Fullers of Rosehid, in Brightling, great Sussex iron-masters. Ihe present house was built by Samuel Fuller, in the first half of the seventeenth century. It was originally a mansion of con siderable dimensions, but now exists as a farm-house. The Fullers appear to have been a London family who settled in Sussex in the sixteenth century, and are now represented by Fuller-Meyrick, Esq. They were successively of Uckfield, Wal dron, and Brightling. Horeham gave name to the family of De Horeham, in or before the fourteenth century. Later it belonged to the Walshes, whose heiress married Thomas Dyke, Esq., in the early part of the seventeenth century. Mr. Dyke probably built Horeham, a great mansion on an older site, and his des cendant was created a baronet in 1676, as Sir Thomas Dyke, of Horeham. The greater part of the mansion has been pulled down, and the remains are now a farm-house. A level tract of land where the parishes of Waldron, Chiddingly, and Hellingly meet, is called Horeham Flat. [S. A. C. Coal found here, ii, 211. Ironworks, ii, 219. iii, 241, 245. xviii, 15.

Its surface is agreeably undulated with well-wooded slopes, while the shel- tered portions possess many hop-gardens. There are several rivulets tributary to the Cuckmere, and some ferruginous srjrings. In the days of the Sussex ironworks there were several estab- lishments in this parish for that manufacture. Among the iron-masters was Richard Woodman, a native of Buxted, but a resident at Warbleton, where he carried on extensive works ; he was burnt, together with nine other Protestants, at Lewes, in 1557. (See \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 138.) His house on the south side of the church still exists, as also the lane down which he ran when pursued hj his persecutors. The church tower is said to have been the place of his temporary incarceration. Warbleton was rather remarkable before the Reformation for its religious establishments, for besides the church there were a chantry and a deanery (probably connected with the College of Hastings), and a priory. The Priory of Warbleton, originally established at Hastings by Sh Walter Bricet, having been destroyed by the inroads of the sea, Sir John Pelham resounded the establishment in this parish in the time of Henry IV., and it was caded the New Priory of the Blessed Trinity of Hastings, though Warbleton is upwards of ten mdes from that town. It was a small establish- ment, and its revenues arose from several parishes in East Sussex, and its present relics are limited to the foundations of its church, and an anticpie farm-house, the property of George Darby, Esq., of Markly. There is also a stable with the re- mains of a pointed arched doorway. Of the history of this new and short-lived establishment very little is known ; but at the dissolution of the smaller priories it shared the fate of all such houses.* In 1537 the premises were granted to John Baker, Esq., and in 37th Henry VIII. to John Caryll, Esq. Subse quently the estate became the property of the family of Roberts, from whom it descended to that of Lade, Baronets, who resided * The establishment appears to have consisted of three canons and one novice.

In one of the apartments of the old house are preserved two ancient skulls, which are connected with a superstitious legend, and in another room there are stains, said to be of human blood, which cannot be effaced. According to the popular belief it is unlucky to remove the skulls from the habitation, though a profane hand not many years ago placed one of them in a neighbouring tree, where it remained a whole summer, and a bird's nest was built in it. The awful sounds which are heard at night time proceed from a colony of owls which have established themselves in the old building. For historical and arch\u00e6ological notes respecting this priory I must refer the reader to the paper of the Rev. E. Turner, in the \" Sussex Collections,\" Vol. xiii. At Bucksteep, formerly a mansion, but now a farm-house, there was a chapel supposed to have been attached to Battle Abbey. Rushlake Green is a pleasant hamlet in this parish, and con tains the principal part of the population. Close by are Stone House, the seat of J. R. Dunn, Esq., a fabric of considerable antiquity, once the abode of the Roberts family ; also Markly, the seat of George Darby, Esq., formerly M.P. for Sussex. Cralle, another house in the parish, anciently belonged to a family of the same name, whose heiress in the 14th century conveyed it to the ancient family of Cheney. Iwood was once the principal mansion of the family of De Warbleton. It be longed in 1st Richard III. to Margery Warbilton, and subse quently passed to the famdy of Fynes, Lords Dacre, then to the Piers, Pelham, and Stollyon families. The house, which com mands most picturesque scenery, was formerly very large, but in 1722, being in a ruinous condition, it was partly pulled down and reduced to the state of a farm-house. The old gateway was built in 1591. In 1795 the old house was taken down and replaced by a commodious farm-house. One of the family of Stollyon sold the estate before 1616 to Henry Smith, Esq. (\"Dog Smith\"), to whose benevolent charity it now belongs. According to tradition Iwood was once occupied by a notorious robber, who constructed a secret chamber, to which the only ingress was the chimney. Stollyons, another ancient property in this parish, and Heathfield derived its name from the family just mentioned. In the 17th century it belonged to the ancient Kent and Sussex family of Haffenden, many of whom lie buried in Heathfield church. About 1624, John Markwick, who was a family con nection of the Haff'endens, was attainted of felony, and so lost tbe estate. On this property grows the rare plant Phyteuma spicatum, supposed to be unique in England in its wild state."], [547, "227 WARBLETON. Concerning the manor of Warbleton we have very few particu lars ; it is mentioned in Domesday as having been held ofthe Earl of Moreton by the Countess Goda. In Saxon times it was worth 40s., and after the Conquest 20s. How it came into the hands of the De Warbletons is unknown. The vidage near the church contains a few houses of antique appearance. The way-side inn has for its sign a halbert thrust into a tun of ale, and bears the punning name of the \" War Bill in Ton.\" The church, which stands on a pleasing elevation, is dedicated to St. Mary, and consists of chancel, nave, north aisle, and west tower. There are traces of Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular work. At the east end of the aisle is a chantry chapel. In the windows there are or have been arms of the families of Pelham, Lewknor, De Warbleton, De Iwood, Cralle, and Cheney. In the north aisle is a very elaborate monument of various-coloured marbles and a finely executed bust to the memory of Sir John Lade, five times M.P. for Southwark, a native of this parish, who died in 1740. On a slab of marble is a brass commemorating ffiSHUfam Dean of the Codege of Hastings, of the date of 1436. It exhibits a full length portrait of the Dean, on the edges of whose robes is an extract from the book of Job, \" Credo quod Redemptor meus vivit,\" and the beautiful crocketed canopy is surmounted by a finial composed of a pelican feeding her young with her blood, and a scrod with the words \" Sic Christus dilexit nos.\" The surrounding legend (now partially destroyed) I have thus ren dered : \u2014 \" Leaving the fleeting honours of this world to die, Beneath this marble hard doth William Prestwiek lie; A constant, patient, humble man. devout, urbane, And just to all.

Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1714. Acreage, 1,051. This small parish, occasionally written Worminghurst, pertains principally to the settled estate ofthe Duke of Norfolk. In early times the manor belonged to the Abbey of Fecamp in Kormandy, and the abbot had free-warren for his reeve, who resided here, and had a park in 39th Henry III., as also a chaplain, whose fee was 100s. in the reign of Edward II. On the dissolution of the alien priories, the property was conferred on the recently-founded monastery of Sion, in Middlesex. In 1448 it was valued at \u00a315 12s. lOd. per annum, and a roll of that date gives minute details of the conveyance of timber and Horsham stone used in the building of Sion monastery. It re quired two wagons, sixteen oxen, and six men te convey eight oak trees from Warminghurst to Kingston in eight days ! In 1540 the lands were transferred to Edward Shelley, Esq., for \u00a3391 10s. In the conveyance there is mention of vineyards. Mr. Shelley died in October, 1554. He had bequeathed the \" remainder\" to the heirs male of John Shelley, of Michelgrove, but other claimants coming forward a great law-suit, called the \" Shelley case\" followed. In that case Queen Elizabeth took great personal interest. It was ultimately decided in favour of Henry Shelley, Esq., the grandson, who held it till 1618, when a part of it was aliened to the Apsleys. Subsequently it be longed to Sir Thomas Haselrige and Sir Thomas Williamson, whose wives were daughters of Sir John Butler, who sold it to Henry Bigland, Esq., by whom it was re-sold in 1676 to William Penn, Esq., the celebrated Quaker and founder of Pennsylvania."], [549, "229 WARN HAM. That eminent man resided here for some years. In 1702 Penn sold the estate to James Butler, Esq., ancl it vested in his descendants till 1789, when it was conveyed by marriage to the family of Clough. In vol. xiv. of the \" Sussex Collections\" there is a remarkable story of an apparition of John Butler, Esq., in 1766, when he was M.P. for Sussex. His shade appeared to Miss Frances Browne, his sister-in-law, and to his steward. He was absent from Warminghurst at the time, but he died at the very moment at which these manifestations occurred. There is a small manor or farm, called Bows olds, wliich belonged in 1622 to the Shelleys; subsequently to several other families. The estate is of little importance. At the beginning of the eighteenth century James Butler, Esq., built a large brick man sion, and converted a great portion of the parish into a deer park. Since the property has come into the hands ofthe Duke of Nor folk, the house has been pulled down, the lake dried up, the timber feded, and the park converted into a farm. Among the timber was a magnificent chesnut tree, which was reckoned, from the rings of its wood, to be 270 years old. The church (Holy Sepulchre ?) consists of a single pace or nave. It has Early English features, but the east window is of the Decorated style, aud the building has been much patched. There is a brass to the memory of ffittoart ictdhj), Esq., sometime one of the Masters of the Household to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Queen Mary, and Joan his wife, who, with their seven sons and three daughters, are duly represented. The date is 1554. Other monumental records comprise the names of Benet, C\u00e6sar, Butler, Blount, Morgan, Clough, Dolben, Riches, Devall, Bovey, Leeves, Oldham, Fenwicke, &c.

Lucas, Esq., and Mrs. Wood. Seats, Warnham Court, C. T. Lucas, Esq. ; Field Place, William Innes, Esq. ; Warnham Lodge, W. N. Franklyn, Esq. This parish, which extends to the frontiers of Surrey, has long been of considerable importance. There appears to be no mention of it in Domesday. The manor was sometimes called Denne. It was held in 1272 by William de Saye. In 1319 it belonged to Sir John Doyley, and in 1375 to Sir Thomas Lewk nor, whose grand-daughter carried it by marriage to John Bart telot, of Stopham, Esq., who died in 1473. Subsequently it passed to the families of Cooper, Upton, Leland, and Commered. Denne, with its demesnes, was severed from the manor in 1650, and de vised to Christopher Coles, of Pulborough, who had married one of the daughters of Walter Barttelot, of Stopham. They were, in 1695, the property of John Evershed, Esq., of Eversheds in Surrey, and subsequently passed into the hands of Young, Lux ford, Codier, Murray, Milward, Lanhani, Charles, Duke of Norfolk, and Broadwood. Field Place, in the southern part of the parish, was the estate, for several centuries, of the family of Michell, who originated at Horsham, and possessed Stammerham, in that parish. The last of the family resident here left a daughter and heiress, who was wife of Sir Bysshe Shelley, Bart. Warnham Pond is an extensive sheet of water, and here it was that Percy Bysshe Shelley, our great Sussex poet, used to amuse himself, in his childhood, with his diminu tive boat. Near it stood a mansion of the Caryll family, who resided here in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Warn ham Court, a handsome structure in the Elizabethan style, com manding very extensive views, and forming a very ornamental feature in the landscape, was built some years since by Henry Tredcroft, Esq. In 1331 John de Upperton settled on Stephen de Slaughters ord a parcel of land at the rent of a barbed arrow. This shows the antiquity of the name of Upperton in Sussex. The impropriation was granted to the neighbouring nunnery of Rusper by William de Braose. On the dissolution of that convent it was granted to the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, who leased it for a certain term, and it is now held by the Shelley family. \" The church,\" says Cartwright, \" exhibits a variety of style. It consists of a nave and south aisle under a sloping roof. There are three chancels. That on the north, enclosed by a Gothic screen, formerly belonged to the Carylls ; that on the south to the Michells, of Field Place ;* and that in * Of the family of Mychcll or Michell, Mr. Gibbon, Richmond Herald, observes in Vol. xii. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" that those of Stammerham, Horsham, and Am berley, were \" all branches of one stem.\" The name still prevails in these localities, and Mr. Gibbon adds : \" I have not any hesitation in saying that I could, with very little trouble, show the descent from our Visitation of Sussex in 1634, of a vast number of the name who at present have little idea of their claims to coat armour.\""], [551, "231 WARTLING. the middle to the impropriation.\" They all belong at present, I believe, to the Shelley family. The building is dedicated to St. Mary. There is a well-preserved monument to Sir John Caryll, knight, who died in 1613, and his wife Maria. It has effigies of the knight and his lady, and of their four sons and five daughters. Among other names and families commemo rated are those of Amherst, Yates, Shelley, Michell, Shuckford, Napper, Bax, and Rapley. \" In the pavement of the south aisle is the site of an altar-tomb, with three shields with quatrefoils, ofthe time of Edward I.\" (Cartwright.) In 1518, there was a chantry in this church, dedicated to St. Margaret. In the last century Warnham was celebrated for its cricketers, and a leader in that sport, who kept an inn, had painted on his sign : \u2014 \" I, John Charman, Can beat half an 'em, With e'er a long-legged man in Warnham.\" [S.

Edward Curteis Graham, B.A. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1539. Acreage, 4,736. Chief Landowner, Herbert Mascall Curteis, Esq., of Windmill Hill. This parish, with its hamlet of Boreham, possesses an agreeable variety of surface, rising from the level of Pevensey marsh to the pleasant eminence of Windmill Hid. In Domes day, the manor is said to be held by William, of the Earl of Eu. Temp. Henry III., it belonged to Widiam de St. Leger. In 1327, Sir Thomas Hoo, then lord, obtained for it a weekly market on Tuesday, and a fair at Magdalen-tide. In 33rd Henry VI., Thomas Lord Hoo was lord, and in his family it remained until their extinction. In later times, it was vested successively in Gage, Sydney, Montague, Sackvide, and Craven. Lord Craven, who built a house at Boreham, sold the manor, in 1766, to John, Earl of Ashburnham. Windmill Hill, on which formerly stood a beacon, was long the residence of the family of Luxford. It afterwards belonged to Comyns and Pigou. Widiam Pigou, Esq., erected the pre-"], [552, "232 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. sent mansion on the old site. It was purchased of him by Edward Jeremiah Curteis, long M.P. for the county (\"Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 233), to whose grandson it now belongs. Old Court, the moat of which remains, was the estate of the family of Fynes, before their removal to the adjacent parish of Hurst- Monceux, where afterwards they built their stately castle. It was near the church. At Foul-mile, in this parish, Speed's map of Sussex indicates a chapel, of the history of which nothing is known. For Boreham, see that article. The church (St. Mary Magdalen) was formerly prebendal, and attached to the college of St. Mary-in-the-Castle, of Hastings. The building, which stands at Wartling Hill, rather remote from the general population of the parish, consists of a nave with aisles and a chancel. The south aisle, or rather chapel, has on the outside a Pelham Buckle, and a Catherine wheel, implying, perhaps, its erection by Catherine, daughter of Sir John Pelham, Constable of Pevensey, temp. Henry VI. There are inscriptions for the families of Luxford, Curteis, and Inglis. The mural monument by Bacon to Caroline, wife of Herbert Barrett Curteis, Esq., mother of the present Herbert Mascall Curteis, Esq., is a fine work of art. [S. A. C. Salt-pans, v, 159. xiii, 135.

It was, therefore, part ofthe barony of Bramber, held by William de Braose. Before the Conquest, Earl Guerd (Gurth, the brother of Harold) was owner of the principal part, but there were sev eral other proprietors ; and at the time of the great Survey, the whole manor was farmed for the large sum of \u00a3100. Tbe five salt-pans mentioned in the record must have been in the detached portion of the manor, on the Adur. From the De Braoses it passed to the Mowbrays, and continued, with some interruptions, in the Dukes of Norfolk. Early in the reign of Elizabeth, it belonged to the Carylls, and was by them held until 1765, since which time it has passed, like Muntham, through the Franklands, to the present owner. Chancton manor gave name to a family in the thirteenth century ; and, after many changes, associated with the names of De Guilde ford, Le Mareschal, Arundel, Browne, Shirley, Edsaw, Butler, and Clough, it became, in 1805, part of the settled estate of the Dukedom of Norfolk. In December, 1866, a remarkable dis covery of Saxon coins took place on Chancton farm. It con sisted of about 3,000 pennies of the reigns of Edward the Confessor and Harold II. , which must have been deposited immediately before the Battle of Hastings, probably by a tenant of Guerd, who fell in that dire conflict. The vessel which had contained them was turned up by the plough, and they were so scattered broadcast, that they were regarded by the peasantry as pieces of old tin, and sold, principally to the village inn keeper, for the purchase of ale. In one instance half a pint of them was offered for a quart of \" double X !\" At length, public attention was called to the \" find,\" and various claims were put in. Ultimately the greater portion of them was deli vered over to the Solicitor of the Treasury. The coins were of upwards of fifty mints, including Chiehester, Hastings, Lewes, and Steyning. A long-enduring tradition of treasure concealed in the place existed, and the spot had always been haunted by a Ghost, in the form of an ancient white-bearded man, who appeared to be in search of something. This is remarkable, and proves that the \" uncertain voice of tradition \" is not al ways to be disregarded. It is quite within the regions of pro bability that the depositor of this hoard was one of the victims of the Norman invasion. Near the church is Rowdell, which from 10th Henry VIII. belonged to the old Sussex family of Byne, and remained in it for five generations. The fine old Jacobean mansion has been replaced, within the present century, by a much less picturesque buildino-. The proprietors since the Bynes have been Caryll, Butler, Goring, and Burred. In 1825, it was purchased by Major Sandham. On the south side of the parish is Highden,"], [554, "234 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. owned in the fourteenth century by the family of De Hiden. Henry Goring, Esq., purchased it in 1647. His son, Sir Henry Goring, Bart., built the present house, and his descendant, Sir Charles Goring, Bart., is now possessor. The church (St. Mary) had Norman features, but falling to decay, it was rebuilt in 1866, at the cost of about \u00a32,000. The tower, of the time of Henry VII., has been retained. The in scriptions commemorate members of the families ofByne,Fortrie, Butler, Waldegrave, Hammond, Goring, &c. On an elevated point of the South Downs, in this parish, is a well-known circular earthwork of Celtic origin, now planted round with trees, and known as Chanctonbury Ring. It is one of the most commanding heights in the county, and said to be 814 feet above the level ofthe sea. It is visible from the east, west, and north, at great distances. Over this part of the Downs, and in this parish, runs one of the numerous steep roads known as \" Bostalls,\" a word scarcely heard out of Sussex, but of good Saxon meaning, for a hid path. [S. A. C.

The soil varies from chalk on the north to loam and alluvium on the south. The land is generally highly cultivated and very productive. The main yidage was formerly a trading town of some importance. It is pleasantly situated near the little river Ems, and lies near Emsworth, which takes its name from that river. The parish"], [555, "235 WESTBOURNE. is beautifully wooded, and the sea separates it from Thorney Island. The manor of Borne is described in Domesday as lying in the hundred of \" Ghidenetroi,\" a designation now obsolete. It had belonged to Earl Godwin, but was now a part of the territory of the Earl Roger de Montgomeri. It had been rated at 30 hides, but was now assessed at only 12. There were seven ministri, four mills, a fishery, and a wood. Henry Fitz-Alan, the last Earl of Arundel of that name, died seised of it, and it then devolved on Jane, one of his co-heiresses, who married John, Lord Lumleyr. In subsequent years it passed with the Stansted estate to the Rev. Lewis Way, and later to C. Scrase Dickins, Esq. The church (St. John the Baptist), which is altogether one of the most interesting ecclesiastical buildings in West Sussex, is approached from the north by a venerable avenue of yew trees, said to have been planted in 1530 by Lord Maltravers. The edifice was twice altered by two of the Earls of Arundel and formerly contained a chapel dedicated to All Souls. There are vestiges of Norman architecture, and Transitional work, but the church has been much altered and patched by the introduction of the Perpendicular style. In the chancel is a beautiful piscina, probably of the fifteenth century, which is engraved in \" Hussey's Churches.\" In 1770, George, Earl of Halifax, lord of the manor, made some benefactions to the building, including a spire, which Horsfield characterizes as of Chinese architecture ! This, however, has been altered, and it is now a great ornament to the landscape. In 1782 the church consisted of nave, chancel, and two aisles. In the years 1863 and 1865 much true restoration was effected. There are six bells, and some painted glass, chiefly modern. Besides one or two ancient monumental slabs, there are many monuments and inscriptions to the families of Barwell, D'Oyley, Bensley, Montague, Eliot, Tatersall, Farley, Needham, Campbell, Oldfield, Lumley, Ward, Roberts, Browne, Prynie, Sedgwick, Cathcart, Walleston, Newland, Mundy,Wallis, Williams, Lyne, Ashburnham, Peake, Allen, &c. The hamlets of Prinsted, Nutbourne, and The Hermitage each ancientlv possessed a chapel ; but few remains of them now exist. The origin of the last-named building was due to \" Simon Cotes of Westborne, Ermyt,\" who in his will, dated 1527, teds us that he had built upon his own land a house and a chapel, which he dedicated to St. Anthony. These, with other build ings, bridges, and highways, he bequeathed to William, Earl of Arundel, K.G., with a view to the maintenance of a Hermit for ever. This, I think, is among the latest of Hermitages in Eng land. Simon was perhaps not a hermit at all, except that he lived a religious life, in his simple habitation, and worshipped"], [556, "HISTORY OF SUSSEX. 236 in his little sacellum.

Thomas Peirs of this family resided at Stonepits, in Seale, co. Kent, and was created a Baronet in 1663. His des cendant, Sir George Peirs, sold Westfield, and it has since passed hy successive transfers to the families of Allen, Craggs, Lade, Lutman, and Lamb, of Rye.

Crowham, the last Prior of Lewes, 1537, is supposed to have taken his name from this place. In the earlier part of the seventeenth century it belonged to the Cheyneys ; afterwards to the Farndens of Sedlescombe ; and subsequently by various modes of transfer to the Snow, Mosley, and Smith families.

It was part of the large possessions of the De Braoses, Lords of Bramber, but seems to have been aliened in the middle of the 14th century.

John, the first-mentioned, appears to have married, first Philippa Michel, and, secondly, another Philippa, daughter of David Strabolgy, Earl of Athol. The latter had previously married Sir Ralph Percy, son of Henry, Earl of Northumberland, by whom she had no children ; by Sir John Halsham she had two sons, who died without issue, and a daughter, Joan, who married John Lewknor, Esq. Later, the manor fell to the Crown, and in 1st Edward VI., Thomas Sey mour held it in fee-farm. On his attainder, it was granted to Thomas Shirley, a younger son of Ralph Shirley, of Wiston, from whom it descended to Thomas Shirley Esq. This gentle man was an ultra-Calvinist, and in his will, made in 1606, he informs us that he has full assurance of resting \" both soul and body in the highest comfortable heaven of heavens,\" among the elect saints of God, of which number \" I assuredly account my self to be one.\" On his death the manor and estate were sold to Sir Edward Caryll, whose grand-daughter, Philippa, wife of Henry, Lord Morley and Monteagle, was seised of them for life, with remainder to her son Thomas, Lord Morley. He joined with his mother in settling the property on Richard Caryll, who died in 1701, when it descended to his grandson, John. This gentleman being a staunch Roman Catholic, and an adherent of James II.,, accompanied the fallen monarch to France, where he assumed, by grant of the Pretender, the title of Lord Caryd. By him the estate was sold in 1750 to Sir Merrik Burrell, Bart., who having added to it several farms, left it to Mrs. Isabella Wyatt, with remainder to Walter Burrell, Esq., second surviving son of his nephew, Sir William Burrell, Bart., and it is now the property of Sir Percy Burred, Bart. The present mansion is on a rising ground, north-east of the old house. It was built in 1806 in a semi-castellated Gothic, from designs by Nash, and has many fine apartments. A good deer-park, with excellent timber, surrounds the house. There are some good pictures by Vandyke, Lely, Jansen, Reinagle, Lawrence, Opie, and by some of the best foreign masters. The house has an historical interest from the fact that Pope was a frequent visitor to the Caryds, and his \" Rape of the Lock \" had its origin from an incident which occurred here. On the east side of the Park is a Roman Catholic chapel, endowed by the Caryll family. Clothalls, near the church, as a manor, derived its name from the family of De Clothad, who resided here in the 15th century. From them it"], [559, "WEST-GRINSTEAD. 239 descended by heirship and marriage through the names of Wilt shire, Bellingham, Boys, Lamb, and Ferris. Champions, on the north side of the parish, was the possession for nearly 200 years of the family of Ward. The manor of Bidlington belonged, as part of the Wiston state, to Sir Robert Fagge, from whom it has descended to the Goring family. The fact of the benefice of West Grinstead being so well en dowed, is attributable to the circumstance that very little of the land in the parish was granted away to monastic institutions. The parsonage house, of the date of James I., was added to by the late rector, Rev. W. Peckham Woodward, and with modern additions, now ranks amongst the highest order of parochial residences. Among the rectors no less than five of the Woodward family held the living in succession from 1695 until a recent period. The people of West Grinstead seem to have been a rather law less race, and Mr. Cartwright, from ancient records, mentions several murders in the parish. The church (St. George) consists of two aisles of equal length, divided by an arcade. The original edifice was Early English, but later insertions have been made. The end of the north aisle is the chancel, and that of the south aisle was the chapel of St. Mary, the burial place of the lords of the manor. The tower stands in the middle of the south aisle, and has a shingled spire. There are six modern bells. In the manorial burying-place are two brasses. The first is to a lady, and much mutilated, and commemorates Philippa, wife of 3Jof)n $Jal!3i)atn, one of the daughters of David de Strabolgie, Earl of Athol, 1385. The other brass is now placed on a low altar tomb, and has canopied figures of an armed knight and lady. The surrounding riband has been torn off by sacrilegious hands ; but a record of it shows that it was for *tr Knight, and Joyce (Jocosa) his wife, 1421 and 1420. A banner above the canopy bears the quartered arms of Halsham and Strabolgie. This is a very interesting brass. There are tablets commemorating the families and names of Caryll, Beding feld, Harrington, Burrell, and Raymond ; but the principal monument is by Rysbrach, which cost \u00a32,000, to the memory of Captain Widiam Powlett, of St. Leonard's Forest, who married Elizabeth, 4th daughter of John Ward, of Champions, in West- Grinstead, and his wife. This gallant captain is associated with the superstitious legend of the \" headless ghost of St. Leonards.\" There is also a flat gravestone with a brass plate for Uofirrt \u0152vabenSCroft, and Joan, his wife, 1520, and 1522. Other inscrip tions commemorate the names of Woodward, Pellatt, Gale, White, Nash, Morgan, Gratwicke, &c. Altogether this is a most picturesque and interesting church. For Knepp Castle, see Shipley.

Chief Landowners, the Duke of Devonshire, and Sir James Duke, Bart. That this parish was an ancient hamlet of the parish of Pevensey is the accepted tradition of the district, and, in fact, in ecclesiastical records, the church of St. Mary is described as a dependent benefice. The village consists chiefly of a main street, separated from the little town of Pevensey by the Roman castle. It contains two very picturesque little houses, with tim bered fronts, one of which has, over the doorway, the Pelham badge of the Buckle. The church is large and handsome, con sisting of a nave, a north aisle, a south chancel, and a massive west tower, formerly much higher than at present. There is a considerable mixture of styles from Norman to Perpendicular. The south wall has very small windows of the earlier date, very high up, and with glazing nearly flush with the external surface. The north aisle and the chancel are both Perpendicular, of about the time of Edward TV. In the large eastern windows still remain portions of well-executed painted glass, which would appear to have formerly represented Christ and the twelve apostles. In the building are memorials to the families of Fagge of Glynley, Thatcher of Priesthawes, Hammond and Meeres, besides traces of much older ones now partly destroyed. Priesthawes is popularly supposed to have been a religious foun dation, though no documentary or architectural evidence can be adduced on the subject. It was long the seat of the ancient family of Thatcher, and there is an absurd tradition of a subter raneous connection between it and Pevensey Castle (two miles distant), such as we find all over England, in Normandy, and many other parts of the Continent, when a \" religious \" site is not far remote from a fortress. Glynley \u2014 vulgo, \" Greenlee \" \u2014 was originally an Elizabethan mansion of considerable preten sions, which belonged successively to the Meeres, Fagges, and"], [561, "241 WESTHAMPNETT. Peacheys. It had excellent grounds, fish-ponds, and groves, in the last century. Both these mansions exist simply as farm houses. Near the village is an ancient almshouse of four tene ments, known as the Hospital of St. John the Baptist, alias \" Gorogltown,\" of uncertain foundation, and of equally uncer tain etymology. Peeling is another house of considerable anti quity ; as likewise is Hankham, now corrupted to Handcombe, which is frequently mentioned in the archives of Battle Abbey, though misprinted in Thorpe's Catalogue as Hawkham. For Langney, see that article. A very small hamlet in the parish bears the singular name of Friday-street. [S. A. C. Marshall's benefaction to church, xviii, 51. Church, xiv, 99, 265.

West Hampnett, so called in distinction from East Hamp nett, a tithing in Boxgrove, is not mentioned in Domesday, but it was an early appendage to the lordship of Halnaker. Temp. Henry VI. Robert Tawke had good lands here. Joan, daughter and co-heiress of William Tawke, married in the sixteenth cen tury, first, Richard Ryman, of Appledram ; and secondly, Edward Barttelot, of Stopham. Anne, the other co-heiress, married Thomas Devenish, of Hellingly, who was partially resident here. The families of Chapman and Rose were afterwards influential. The large mansion, West Hampnett Place, now used as a union workhouse, was the seat of the Sackville family, and is supposed to have been built by Richard Sackville, uncle of the Lord Treasurer Buckhurst. The back part of the house is Eliza bethan ; the brick front towards the road is modem, having been rebuilt in the last century by Sir Hutchins Williams, Bart., husband of Judith Booth, celebrated for her talents and beauty. Their son, Sir W. Peere Williams, sold it to Charles, third Duke of Richmond, who converted it to its present use. The parish VOL. II. E"], [562, "242 Hli-TORY OF SUSSEX. contains the vills of Woodcote, Westerton, Waterbeech, and Maudlin. The church (St. Mary or St. Peter) consists of chancel, nave, and south aisle, in the Early English and later styles. In the aisle under the belfry is a smad chantry chapel. In the mould ings of the north door, both inside and out, are three shields of arms including Tawke ; three mullets in chief (Benion?); and three hammers. In the chancel is a monument to the memory of Richard Sackville, Esq., and Elizabeth Thatcher, his wife, with kneeling figures of both ; and of a son and daughter, together with the arms of Sackville and Thatcher, and a mutilated re presentation of the Trinity. During some restorations in 1867, some very interesting, and much more ancient, features, which had been concealed by lath and plaster, were brought to light. The chancel arch was found to have been constructed of brick of Roman make, which had doubtless been brought hither from the ancient station of Regnum (Chiehester). Mr. Gordon Hdls, the architect employed, believes that the chancel, at least, was constructed in Saxon times, and probably in the time of St. Wilfred, the founder of the South Saxon bishopric of Selsey. (\"Journal of British Arch\u00e6ological Association,\" 1867, p. 1.) In the churchyard is a tombstone to the memory of the late Mr. W. H. Brooke, artist and F.S.A., wed-known for his etchings in several volumes of the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" who was interred here by his friend, Mr. Robert Elliot, F.S.A., of Chiehester.

The manor descended as Worth. In this parish is the denuded range of sandstone called the Chiddingly Rocks, one of which, known as Great-upon- Little, is \" a parallelopipedon, about 20 feet high,\" whose four sides measure more than 63 feet. This immense mass, weighing 500 tons, is poised upon a little point of another rock, which just protrudes from the soil \u2014 whence the appellation. It has been supposed to be of Druidic origin, and Governor Pownall communicated a learned disquisition respecting it to the \" Arch\u00e6ologia ;\" but the slightest view of it, with an examination of the adjacent rocks, will show that it is the result of geological denudation. It has long been an object of curiosity, ancl names and dates from the early part of the 17th century downwards, are cut upon it. The Elizabethan mansion of Gravetye was once the seat ofthe Infield family, who carried on iron-works here ; and there are two other houses of considerable importance, one at Stoneland, and the other near the church, the supposed residence of tbe Peldwickes. On Selsfield Common, a commanding height, there was formerly a beacon. The church consists of a nave, chancel, south aisle, and a handsome tower and shingled spire, which is a great ornament to the landscape. There are five bells, one of which is inscribed to St. Mary. The building has Transition- Norman, and Early English and later features. There are memo rials to the names of Infield, Sawyer, Nairn, Wood, Griffiths, and Wetherell.

In 6th Edward IL, John, Earl of Warenne, procured a charter for a fair, on the feast of St. Martin, the patron saint of the parish. In later times it has been possessed by the noble families of Poynings, and Fynes, Lords Dacre. In the sixteenth century, the Michelbornes were of Westmeston manor, and probably built the \" Place \" house. To them suc ceeded the Dobells, whose successors have held the manor in the same line as Streat. In or near this parish is Chatfield, which gave name to a widely-spread Sussex family. So early as 1287 the names of Robert and Reginald de Chattefeld occur in a transfer of land here. The estate of Hayley anciently had a park, some vestiges of which are stdl existing. In the sixteenth century the Earl of Derby had a moiety of it, which, temp. Philip and Mary, his son and heir granted to John Carril, of Warnham, for twenty one years. John Carril, his son, demised the same for his term to John Shelley. East Chiltington is an outlying chapelry of this parish. The church (St. Martin) consists of a nave, chancel, south aisle, and a shingled dovecote steeple at the west end. It has Norman features. The chancel, Mr. Hussey thinks, is Early English, though the chancel arch is semicircular. The west end has Perpendicular insertions. In 1862, the Rector, in the course of some restorations, discovered a series of mural paint ings of Norman date, covering the north and east walls of the nave, together with part of the south wall. The subjects con sisted of the Scourging, the Crucifixion, the Taking down from the Cross, the Adoration of the Magi, the legend of St. Vin cent's martyrdom by Datian, Dioclesian's pro-consul in Spain, &c. A fully illustrated account of these early works of art is given in the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections,\" by the Rev. C. H. Campion.

In later times, it belonged to the powerful family of De Echingham, and subsequently to the Finches, ancestors of the Earls of Winchelsea. In still later times, the Pelhams possessed it, and it now belongs to the Earl of Ashburnham. The parish gave name to an ancient family called De Watlyngton, aud in 1307, John de Watlyngton was elected abbot of Battle. The manor of Fame or Vinehall, anciently, Fynhawe, gave name to the family of De Fynhawe, who ultimately wrote themselves Vinall, settled at Kingston, near Lewes, and became extinct about the end of the seventeenth century.

A lofty height of the Downs, which run directly southward to Beachy Head through this parish, is called Crow-crouch, from a cross which formerly stood there. The modern mansion of Ratton occupies an elevated spot on a declivity of the Downs. Of the ancient manor-house nothing but the old gatehouse remains, though, towards the end of the last century, it was * Ratton anciently had a park, the remembrance of which is perpetuated in \" Park Farm,\" a portion of the estate, and formerly celebrated for its decoy of ducks, the ponds of which remain."], [567, "247 WILLINGDON. entire, and had its venerable hall decorated with halberts, partisans, cross-bows, and other warlike implements. It was deserted, as the residence of the proprietors of the estate, on the erection of the new Ratton-place by Sir George Thomas, Bart., Governor of Antigua, who had acquired the property by purchase of Samuel Durrant, of Lewes, Esq. The earlier history of Ratton (coinciding with the manor of Willingdon) is interest ing. It extends into the parishes of Willingdon and Eastbourne, and proceeds by a narrow slip of land into the distant parishes of Hellingly, Chiddingly, and Heathfield. In one part of Hellingly the connection is formed only by a thick hedge, as I have heard my late father say. In the time of the Confessor it was held by Godwin, Earl of Kent, and was valued at sixty pounds. After the Conquest the Earl of Moreton obtained the manor, when it was valued at forty pounds. Richard de Aquila, a subsequent lord of the great barony of Pevensey, gave a portion of it to the abbey of Grestein in Normandy. Henry III., in the 44th year of his reign, granted the manor to his kinsman, Peter of Savoy. Edward IV. settled it in dower on his consort, Queen Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth (Tudor) granted it. about 1568 to Thomas, Lord Buckhurst, for the annual rent of \u00a373 10s., and a pound of pepper. It would appear that the manor was formerly held by sub-feudatories, as there is a tolerably clear history of Ratton, unconnected with the noble and royal personages above enumerated. Indeed a separate manor of Radetone is mentioned in Domesday. Ratton gave name to a family at an early period, and their ultimate heiress married Walter de Rackele, whose last descendant espoused John Parker, who was living in 18th Henry VI. Tbe Parkers became one of tbe most eminent fami lies of the county, and held this estate for upwards of three centuries. They had previously been resident at Bexhill (then called Bexley) in East Sussex, for several generations, and before and after their acquisition of Ratton they were allied with the best families in this and other counties, namely, Halle of Ore, Levet of Hollington, Bate of Lydd, Thatcher of Ringmer, Pelham, Farnfold, Gage, Sackville, Wader of Groombridge, Selwyn of Friston, Courtney of Powderham, co. Devon, Temple of Stowe, co. Buckingham, Dacre of Hurst-Monceux, Newdigate of Warwickshire, Campion of Combwell, Shurley of Isfield, &c. In fact, the genealogical rolls of our county scarcely exhibit a greater number of splendid alliances. In 1674, Sir Robert Parker was created a baronet, but the title became extinct with his grandson, Sir Walter, in 1750. Of this family were John Parker, deputy of George Boleyn, Lord Rocheford, Lord Warden of the Cinque-Ports, who rebuilt Ratton and died in 1558, and Sir Nicholas and Sir John Parker, both captains of"], [568, "248 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. the important fortress of Pendennis Castle, in Cornwall ; but the most noticeable member of the family was Henry, son of Sir Nicholas Parker, who was born at Ratton about the beginning of the 17th century. After his university career at Oxford, he became a member of Lincoln's Inn ; and at the commencement of the Civil War, he took the Parliamentary side, and was secre tary of war under the Earl of Essex. On the Earl's death he retired to Hamburg, from whence he was recaded by Cromwell to be his secretary, or, as Anthony-a-Wood calls him, \" a brewer's clerk! \" He was an industrious author, and. published several theological and political works, which acquired considerable popularity in their day. He died in 1657. His grandmother, Hester, wife of Sir Thomas Temple, of Stowe, Bart., survived him and lived to see the astonishing number of upwards of seven hundred descendants from her own body. This fact is vouched for by Fuller in his \"Worthies of England,\" that \"worthy\" having lost a wager on the subject. (Vol. i, p. 210, edit. 1840.) The estate of Ratton passed through the Parkers to the family of Trayton, and the last male heir of that family devised it to Samuel Durrant, Esq., of Lewes, to whom he was under heavy pecuniary engagements. It may be remarked here that the name of Trayton, so common as a Christian name in this part of Sussex, is owing to the fact that Mr. Edward Trayton, a rather \" fast man \" of his time, and highly popular among the farmers and tradesmen, became godfather to many children ; and to this day hundreds of Sussex people bear the pr\u00e6nomen of Trayton, believing it to be as orthodox and regular as John or William. The church consists of nave, chancel, north aisle, and south porch, with a tower at the west end of the aisle. Mr. Hussey considers the tower to have been partially or wholly rebuilt, though the arch is of Norman date. There are Early English features, but the windows are chiefly Perpendicular. \"The nave is remarkably spacious. The aisle was evidently once more considerable than at present, and might have originady been the nave.\" (Hussey's \" Churches,\" p. 378.) This arrangement, however abnormal, produces a pleasing and picturesque effect, and the commanding site of the building renders it one of the most interesting churches in this part of the county. There are five bells. In the Parker chapel are several interesting monu ments to that family. There is a brass of a man in armour with the coat of Parker quartering Rakeley and Ratton, and impaling Sackville, to gfoljlt parker, Esq., and Johan, his wife, 1543 ; as also another with the arms of Parker, and its quarter ings impaled with Waller of Groombridge, to Thomas Parker, Esq., of the date of 1580. But the monumental glory of the"], [569, "249 WILMINGTON. church is a marble tomb to Sir Nicholas Parker, representing the effigies of the knight in armour under a canopy, with kneel ing figures of his three wives, and the arms and quarterings of his several alliances. Beneath the arch is a metrical epitaph, concluding thus : \u2014 \" Then blame not aged Britain's feeble womb, For in her Parker's birth she did consume Her utmost strength. The world will scarce be strong For such another brave conception.\" There are numerous other memorials in the building. Roman and other coins have been found at Willingdon. Hidney, formerly a member of the Cinque Ports, in this parish, is mentioned in a separate article. Far out at sea, on the south boundary, is a shoal called the \" Horse of Willingdon.\" [S. A. C.

This agreeable village, standing on a declivity of the South Downs, commands a view of those undulating bills, and from the heights above it the great Weald is seen to much advantage. The manor of Wineltone belonged in Ante-Norman times to Earl Godwin, father of Harold. After the Conquest it fed, with the Rape of Pevensey, into the hands of Robert, Earl of Moreton, who gave it to the great Benedictine Abbey of Gres tein, near Honfleur, in Normandy, which had been founded by his father. The Domesday record states that the manor con sisted of eight hides, with an arable of nine ploughlands, one of which was detached, in the Rape of Hastings. Alnod had held it of Earl Godwin, and besides this there appears to have been another manor of four hides, which the Norman abbot also held ; but the account is much confused. There were 16"], [570, "250 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. vdleins, 10 bondsmen, and 9 ploughs. The total value was thir teen pounds. In the reign of William Rufus the Norman monks sent over some of their brethren to take care of their lands, and a smad cell to the mother abbey was founded here, and was known as Wilmington Priory. It subsisted till 1414, when Henry V., during his wars with France, suppressed the \"Alien\" priories. The Rev. G. M. Cooper has brought together all the known facts connected with this small ecclesiastical establish ment, in Vol. iv. of the \" Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections.\" These are not numerous, but we learn that the principal posses sions of the house were, besides the demesne at Wilmington, Frogfirie in Alfriston, property at Pevensey, and certain rights in Ashdown Forest for pannage (pig-feeding), and for wood, fuel, and church-building. Other possessions are mentioned in Waldron, Laughton, East Hothly, Hellingly, Tilton, in Selmes ton, Heighton, Langney, and also the advowsons of Eastdean, Westdean, and West-Firle. There were smaller benefactions from others, as Charlston in Westdean, Milton in Arlington, Sutton-juxta-Seaford, Berwick, Exceit, Sherrington, in Selmes ton, Westham, and many other neighbouring places. Edward IL, seized the property of all the alien priories in this county, and Wilmington was of course included in the number. Ed ward III. also confiscated the priory estate, but restored it after his war with France had terminated. The subsequent history of Wilmington Priory consists of a series of squabbles between this establishment and the Crown, until its final disestablishment by Henry V. Mr. Cooper has stated ad these matters with minute detail in his elaborate paper. The families of Sackville and Compton became in turn lords of the manor, and Sir Spencer Compton, the eminent statesman, was created, in 1730, Earl of Wilmington. By an heiress of the Compton family it was conveyed to Lord G. A. H. Cavendish, whose descendant, the Duke of Devonshire, is the present lord. Of the priory there are but slight remains, consisting chiefly of an entrance gate, flanked with two towers of the 15th cen tury ; an apartment with a vaulted roof, now used as a parlour ; and a crypt or vaulted cellar of considerable architectural in terest. The remains of the building have long been occupied as a farm house. To the south-east of the monastery, on the escarpment of the South Downs, is a gigantic figure of a man, which was formerly laid bare to the chalk, after the manner of the \" white horse \" in Wiltshire. It can only be seen when the sun's rays strike the spot at a particular angle, or when there is some snow on the ground. The figure is 240 feet in length, and holds a staff in each hand parallel to the body. Some antiquaries assign these hid-side figures to a very remote antiquity, but I"], [571, "251 WINCHELSEA. think there is little doubt that this was an idle freak of the monks of Wilmington, especiady as an analogous giant, 180 feet high, armed with a club, is found opposite the abbey of Cerne in Dorsetshire, on the face of a chalk hill. Our figure is locally known as the \" Long Man.\" The church (St. Mary and St. Peter) is a small building close to the priory, and principally of late Norman and Early English work, with admixtures of later styles. \"The form of the church,\" as Mr. Cooper observes, \" is singular, the north and south transepts in no way corresponding ; the former bears the appearance of a side chapel.\" In the church-yard is a noble yew-tree, probably older than the church itself. ,There are memorials for the names of Hay, Edwards, Hodsden, Hubersty, Sunderland, Ade, &c. A branch of the \" ubicpiitous Culpepers \" resided sometime at Wilmington Priory, and their arms appear on a mutilated monument in the south chapel. A considerable number of tbe bronze implements, called Celts, was found in this parish in 1861. They are preserved at Lewes Castle. In this parish is a place called Mountain Pin, corrupted from Monken-Pyn, or the Monk's Pine, probably from its hav ing been connected with Wilmington Priory. [S. A. C.

A parish and \"Ancient Town\" in the Eape of Hastings ; distant three miles south-west from Eye, its Post-town and Union. It has its own Bail- way station on the South Eastern Bailway.

Durrant Cooper, Esq., F.S.A., whose \" History of Winchelsea,\" 1850, is replete with interest and careful record. The site of the original Winchelsea was a low flat island at the south-east extremity of the county, two miles south-south-east of the rock upon whieh the town of Rye now stands. It was then bare and insulated. There is no evidence"], [572, "252 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. of this place having been known to the Romans, though two or three authorities have made the assertion. To the Saxons it mas known, and from them derived its name \u2014 Wincel, a corner, and ea, water, which well describes the original situation. A ridiculous verse quoted by Jeake, alluding to the eastern mem bers of the Cinque Ports, runs \u2014 \" Dovor, Sandivicus, Ry, Rum, Frig-mare-ventus,\" and the last name has been rendered \" Wind-chills-sea !\" \u2014 not a phenomenon quite peculiar to this place. The Saxon Chronicle and Domesday book are both silent, yet it is stated by Ruding that King Edgar had a mint here in 959. A charter of Henry III. mentions that Edward the Confessor granted this town with Rye to the monks of Fecamp, in Normandy. Mr. Cooper thinks he traces Winchelsea, though not actually mentioned, eo nomine, in the record ; but this point requires further research. The importance of Winchelsea at the time of the Conquest and in succeeding reigns is shown by several facts. Here, on Decem- ber 7th, 1007, the Conqueror landed, and by his sudden arrival i defeated the plans of the Saxons for shaking off the Norman -, yoke. Tn 1138, King Henry ,11.. having been over sea respect >Ting State affairs, landed here. Norden states that when it was in its most flourishing condition it contained 700 householders, but quotes no authority. Kilburne, the Kentish historian, says it was anciently \" a pretty town and much resorted to;\" and a M S. in the Dering collection says it had once in it 50 inns and taverns. The towns of Winchelsea and Rye were probably added to the Cinque Ports by the Conqueror. They were cer- tainly brought into that ancient league before the- time of John, since in the first year of his reign (1200) both rendered service in the navy as members of Hastings. The style of these towns was \" nobiliora membra Quinque Portuum.\" They are now caded \"the Ancient Towns.\" In the early part of the thirteenth century, Old Winchelsea was in its greatest pros- perity : it had a large commerce, and its bay was the rendezvous for the English fleet. More than once it was menaced by the French, and a descent was expected in 1216, when King John wrote to the Barons of Winchelsea to order them that if his enemy Louis (son of Philip of France, an aspirant to the monarchy of England) should land there, that rather than his town should be burnt or greatly damaged, they should offer him 200 marks as a ransom. In 1217, the men of Winchelsea took an active part in the naval engagement between the Ports' fleet, under Hubert de Burgh, against the French, under De Courtney. During the first half of the thirteenth century, tremendous storms took place on the English coast. Up to"], [573, "253 WINCHELSEA. the year 1250, Winchelsea had escaped tolerably well. But then some churches, several bridges, mills, banks, &c, and 300 houses were destroyed by the rising of the waters. The sea is said to have flowed twice without ebb, making a horrible noise, and at night it seemed to be \" light-a-fire ;\" three noble ships and smaller craft, at a place called Hucheburn, were cast away, and foundered. Four years later, the crops could not be gathered in as usual, the ground being covered with salt. The old town had several religious establishments, consisting of the churches of St. Thomas and St. Giles, a House of Grey Friars, founded soon after the introduction of that order in 1224, and a hospital of St. Bartholomew. In the Barons' War, the Cinque Ports sided with De Montfort. King Henry reached Winchelsea on the 8th of May, 1264, and remained till the 10th, when he marched towards Lewes to meet the baronial army, and on the 1 4th of the same month the tremendous battle of Lewes took place. When Eleanor, countess of the successful De Montfort, made her journey with the Earl from Porchester to Dover in the following year, they passed with their suite through Winchelsea, where they sj>ent a day and feasted the burghers. For two years after the Barons' success at Lewes the men of Winchelsea devoted their energies to piracy, in which Simon de Montfort, son of the baronial leader, took an active part. In 1266, a terrible retribution occurred. Prince Edward took the town by assault, and much bloodshed en sued. The bulk of the population, however, were spared, and commanded to forsake their piratical practices. In 1276, the King himself arrived at Winchelsea, no longer to chastise, but to arrange for the transfer of a new and more favourable site. At length, in 1287, the great inundation happened, which sub merged all the marshy ground between Clivesden, near Fair light, and Hythe. This was on February 4th, 1287, and this place was no longer habitable. In the Old town of Winchelsea was born, in the thirteenth century, Robert of Winchelsey, the celebrated Archbishop of Canterbury. Following Mr. Cooper, we find that after Henry's visit to the threatened town, he sent thither John Kirkeby, Bishop of Ely, and Treasurer of England, to fix upon a site for a new town. The site adopted was a hill in the adjoining parish of Ickles ham, then called Iham. The spot was principally a sandstone rock, used as a rabbit-warren. The base of this rock was washed by the waters on the east and north sides. The whole land assigned for the town was 150 acres, and the work of rebuilding was proceeded with. In the quaint words of Leland, \"The King set to his helpe in beginning and wauling New Winchel-"], [574, "254 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. sey ; and the inhabitants of Old Winohelsey tooke by a litle and litle, and buildid at the new toune. So that wythyn the vi or vii yere afore expressid the new toune was metely welle fur- nished, and dayly after for a fewe yeres encreasid.\" Thomas, of Walsingham, calls the new town a Port upon a hill, very steep on the side looking towards the sea, or where it overlooks the road where the ships lie at anchor. He adds that on this precipitous side there is only a rampart of earth, while on the other sides there was a wall of stone. An accident happened to the King who had gone down to view the progress of the works. His horse, frightened by the rattling of a windmill, plunged, and threw the rider; but the townsmen took him up almost unharmed. Besides the wall, there was a castle which commanded the inner harbour, and until 1828 there stood a round watch-tower, called the Roundle. Ofthe ancient gateways three are still standing, namely, Strand-gate, New-gate, and Pipewell-gate, andform very picturesque objects. Besides the two churches of St. Thomas and St. Giles within, and that of St. Leonard without, the walls, the house of Grey-friars and the hospital of St. Bartholomew, which had existed in the old town, were represented in the new. There were also hospitals of St. John and the Holy-Rood; and afterwards, in the reign of Edward II , a house of Black-Friars was founded. Water supplies were easily obtained from six open wells, known as Pipe well, St. Catherine's, Strand, New, Friars', and Vale wells. The town abounds with crypts and vaults, some of which have hand- some groinings. It was among these, probably, that Grose found what he considers 14 or 15 chapels which tradition- ally existed ; but they were doubtless nothing more than stores for wine and other merchandise. The town was laid out in 39 quarters or squares of varying shapes and dimensions, the streets enclosing them generady running at right angles. Some of the quarters had singular names, as Cook's Garden, Ballad- singer's Plat, Trojan's-had, and Tinker's-garden. The exact sites of the squares and places are given as they existed 20th Edward I., in a record remaining among the national records, together with the names of each proprietor in the 39 quarters, several hundreds in number. Many of the names are those of families still extant in East Sussex, such as Milward (leMeleward) Coleman, Petit, Dawe, Crouche, Podard, Broker (Brooker), Lamb Frost, Deryng, Pilcher, Terry, Pace, Seman, now Simmons, &c! The name of Alard is the most conspicuous. Mr/ Cooper men tions the comparative importance of the naval resources of the town among its sister Cinque Ports in 1294, when Edmund the king's brother, was about to sail for Gascony. Out of the 50 ships supplied by the ports, Winchelsea furnished 13, the names"], [575, "WINCHELSEA. 255 of which, with their masters and constables, are given by Mr. Cooper. As the king's foreign affairs became more urgent, the town walls were strengthened, and as the sea began to make encroachments, it was necessary to add to and strengthen the embankments. It would be impossible in this limited space to mention in detail the royal orders, charters, &c, which followed these events ; Mr. Cooper, however, gives most of them. For warlike affairs the town had its governor, and for internal matters its bailiff and corporate officers. The French made frequent attacks, and in 1350 a naval engagement took place off Win chelsea, between the English fleet, commanded by King Edward TIL, assisted by the Black Prince, and the Spanish armament, which consisted of 10,000 men. The struggle was tremendous, ancl lasted many hours, ending in the discomfiture of the Spaniards, who lost 14 out of 40 ships, while the rest fled in disorder. The King and his nobles anchored in the evening at Rye and Winchelsea, and taking horse rode two leagues to the mansion where the Queen was \u2014 probably at Echingham. The Queen was overjoyed to meet her husband, her sons, and the other great lords, for she had received a full account of the con flict which her attendants had viewed from a height which commanded the scene of action. A graphic account of the battle is given by Froissart and other chroniclers. In 1359 the French attacked Winchelsea, entered it, to the number of 3,000, and partly burnt it down. The atrocities they committed are almost too horrid for recital. They entered the church during divine service, and carried off the most beautiful of the women, and took 13 ships, well freighted with wine and victuals. The English had their reprisals, for in the following year the Cinque Ports navy, with their adies, numbering 80 ships, as sembled at Winchelsea, and, setting sail for France, burnt the town of Luce, in the isle of Sans, and afterwards entered the isle of Caux. In fact, throughout the reign of Edward III., Winchelsea was the scene of war and naval preparations, which proves that the town was then regarded in the same light as Portsmouth and Plymouth became in later ages. The most memorable attack of the French was in 1376, when the valiant Hamo of Offington, Abbot of Battle, with an improvised army, routed their forces. Two years later he was less successful. An attack was made, and the Abbot put to flight, after great damage had been done to the town. In later times Winchelsea became the port of embarcation for pilgrims to St. James of Compostella. The last attack of the French was in 1448 or 1449, when no great damage was done. From that date Winchelsea gradually decreased m trade and importance, and the sea having receded, Rye became the port for this part of the coast. The dissolution of the"], [576, "256 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. religious houses, as Mr. Cooper observes, completed the ruin of the town. Although when Queen Elizabeth in 1573 visited the place, and was met in procession by the mayor and jurats in scarlet gowns, she named it \" Little London,\" its day was gone by, and its subsequent history is one of decline and decay. Since Elizabeth's time the sea has receded a mile or more. The mer chants retired to more profitable resorts. From time to time this once important town dwindled down to the proportions of an inconsiderable village, and still so continues, though it pos sesses numerous remains of its ancient importance. Among the oldest is the Court-hall, or Water-bailiff's prison, which seems to have been built on an older site in the Tudor period. But by far the most interesting relic is the church of St. Thomas, now a mere fragment of the original building, yet still forming one of the most interesting and picturesque ecclesiastical edifices in the diocese. The choir and chancel, with fragments of the transepts, now only remain of this large cruciform church. The south aisle was formerly the chapel of St. Nicholas, in which was the chantry of the Alard family, while the north aisle (St. Mary) contained the Farncombe chantry. During repairs of modern date, mutilated remains of a piscina and three highly ornamented sedilia were brought to light. The architectural details of the whole building are of most interesting character. Near the south-west side of the church-yard stood, untd 1790, a campande or bell-tower. \" In the aisles of the choir are five fine monuments ; three are canopied tombs of cross-legged secular warriors (probably Crusaders) one of a young man who had not been knighted, and the fifth of a lady in the dress of Edward III.'s time.\" (Cooper.) The monumental glory of the building is the richly canopied tomb ascribed to Gervase Alard, Admiral of the Cinque Ports, with a recumbent effigy. This magnificent memorial, which has been figured by Blore and Cooper, is without doubt the finest in Sussex, and belongs to the later part of the 13th century. In the choir is a slab, the brass of which has disappeared, for Kfjnautl aiart,1354. There is also a small brass for a priest, without name or date. There are more modern memorials to the names of Jorden, Lambard, Godfrey, Dawes, Stuart, Dyne, Hollingberry, Denne, Newman, Maliphant, Baldwin, Stileman, Richards, Terry, Ade, &c. The church of St. Giles stood on the west side of the town, and con sisted of a nave, chancel, one aisle, and a small tower with one bell. The wads were in a ruinous state in 1608, and were in course of time removed. The monastery of Grey Friars, originally established at Old Winchelsea, had one of the best sites in the new town alfotted to it. It was built on the east side of the town. It was a large"], [577, "257 WINCHELSEA. building, and had a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The choir is still standing as a picturesque ruin in the grounds of Mr. Stileman. There is little history attached to this founda tion, and at the Reformation it shared the common fate. After having passed through several proprietorships, it came into the possession of the late Richard Stileman, Esq., and stid remains in his family. The house of Black Friars was founded by Edward II. , in 1318. The prior and his brethren built a commodious house with an oratory. The establishment was dissolved in 1535, and no remains of it exist except a few walls and five large crypts in what is called Chesnut field. The site now belongs to the Dawes family. There was in the town a Preceptory dedicated -to St. Anthony, but except a brass seal of the time of Henry VI., no record of the foundation exists. The hospitals of St. John, the Holy Cross, and St. Bartholomew, fell, of course, with the rest of the religious houses of the town. The Wesleyan chapel of this town was built in 1786. Mr. Wesley once officiated in it, and in 1790 he preached his last open-air sermon beneath a large tree near the church-yard, to a numerous auditory. \" I went,\" he says, \" over that poor skele ton of ancient Winchelsea \" \u2014 a felicitous expression. The tree is still standing. Among the ancient families of Winchelsea were those of Alard, of Saxon origin, and still existing in Kent ; Finch, great mer chants here, and ancestors of the Earls of Winchelsea ; Oxen bridge, ancestors of the family of that name at Brede Place ; Londenays; Godfrey, M.P.'s for this and other towns, and founders ofthe chantry in St. Thomas's church ; and Famcombe, originally \" of that ilk \" in Patcham, from whom descended Aid. Thomas Famcombe, Lord Mayor of London in 1850. The manor of Yham, Iham, or Higham, lies in this and several adjoining parishes. It belonged to the Kentish family of Guldeford, originally of East Guldeford, near Rye, and passed through the families of Caryll, Wyndham, and Ashburnham, to the present possessor, H. Mascall Curteis, Esq. Within this manor in 1849 was built a new church. It lies on the west side of the mouth of Rye harbour, and is popularly known as Rye harbour church. In this manor lies the Camber, meaning on this coast a haven, part of which is east of the Rother, and was doubtless part of Old Winchelsea. Winchelsea, or Camber Castle, is actually in the parish of Icklesham It is one ot the numerous coast defences built by Henry VIII. about 1539. It stands on a marshy plain, two miles north-east of the town. Many of the main walls, built of brick, cased with squared stenes, are Still standing. The plan is a large circular tower or keep, surrounded by smaller ones connected by short curtain waUs. VOL. II."], [578, "258 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. There is but little of interest now in these crumbling remains, though the castle must have been considered in its time an im portant fortress, having a governor and a suitable staff of officers. At length it was dismantled, and the sea having deserted the site, it has gradually fallen into the ruinous condition in which we see it at this day. The decay of Camber haven has gone pari passu with that of the castle. Norden tells us, however, that so lately as 1624, the old men remembered having seen 400 tall ships of all nations anchored in the Camber, \" where now sheep and cattle feed.\" At the north-west corner of the town lie the smad Parish and Liberty of St. Leonard. It belongs to the port of Hastings. The church formerly contained an image of St. Leonard holding a vane in his hand, to which the women of Winchelsea used to resort, and turned the vane in the direction \" towards such coasts as they desired the wind to serve for the speedy return of their friends or husbands.\" The last rector instituted was in 1484, and after that the building fed to decay. The town is governed by a mayor and jurats, and enjoys all Cinque- Port privileges. The common seal is very elaborate, and belongs to the reign of Edward I. Winchelsea sent two mem bers to Parliament from 42nd Edward III., till 1832, and by the Boundary Act of that year it was thrown into the electoral dis trict of Rye. This article is an imperfect abridgment of Mr. Cooper's work, and that gentleman has supplemented his valuable volume by a paper in Vol. viii. of the \" Sussex Collections,\" chiefly relating to corporation and maritime affairs, with an elaborate account of the great East Sussex family of Oxenbridge.

Benefice, a Vicarage, with the Curacy of Loxwood, valued at \u00a3440 ; Patron, the Bishop of London ; Incumbent, Eev. M. W. Gregory, M.A., of VVadham College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1560. Acreage, 8,484. This Wealden parish lies upon a clayey soil, and a consi derable portion of it is occupied by woodland and waste. It is divided into the several districts of Palingham, Drungewick, Loxwood, Hasfold, &c. Palingham was anciently one of the tithings of West Easwrith, and it extends into Petworth and Kirdford. The manor was held of the Honour of Arundel, and was annexed to those of Shillinglee and Hibernow, with the parks of Medhone and Bignor. It passed by a forced exchange between Henry VIII. and the Earl of Arundel, for the site and lands of Michelham in Pevensey Rape. Afterwards it returned to the Earls of Arundel, and in 1790 came to Sir Edward Onslow, of Drungewick, whose descendants sold it to the late Earl of Egremont. In the reign of Elizabeth the river Arun was made navigable to Palingham, for the purpose of bringing down tim ber from the Weald, and a large iron furnace was established here. The canal connecting the Arun with the Wey at Shal ford, in Surrey, runs through this parish. It was opened for general traffic in 1816. Drungewick, including the manor of Bradbridge in Slynfold, originally belonged to the Abbey of Seez, in Normandy, and their cell at Arundel. In 1256 it was transferred to Climping, Bishop of Chiehester, who established there a staurum, or store of cattle, which consisted of 250 oxen, 100 cows, 10 bulls, 3,100 sheep, 120 she-goats, 10 he-goats, and 10 horses, and this stock was kept up from 1256 to 1560. Thus the episcopal menage must have provided well for its kitchen. Of course there were a grange and a chapel, but of these we know but little. The bishops, however, frequently visited their property here, and held ordinations in the chapel. At a later date the knightly family of Onslow, from whom sprang Sir Richard Onslow, Bart., Speaker of the House of Commons, 1708, and his brother, Foot Onslow, Esq., became respectively pro genitors of the Barons and Earls of Onslow. Loxwood, for merly Lokyswood, was parcel of the manor of Bury, and was held of the Honour of Arundel by the family of Threele for several generations. The families of King and Onslow were afterwards proprietors. The cliapel of Loxwood was built by license of Bishop Praty, in 1414. About the year 1540, three maiden sisters are said to have repaired and endowed the chapel. The building, which consists of nave and chancel, was repaired by an injunction from the Bishop about the year 1828. Has fold or Haresfold, belonged, temp. Edward I., to Richard, Earl s 2"], [580, "260 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. of Arundel, and in the reign of Henry VI. to Mary, wife of Sir Rowland Lenthal. Subsequent owners have been Apsley, Threele, Cowper, Osborne, and Peachey, of Lord Selsey's family. The benefice is a prebendal rectory, with the impropriate tithes and the advowson of the vicarage. The church (St. Peter and St. Paul) and the village stand upon a hill. The former consists of a nave with two aisles, and a tower with a lofty shingled spire. There are memorials for the names of Threele, Dalgress, Mille, King, Yates, Laker, &c, and three bells. [S. A. C. Ironworks, ii, 220. xviii, 15. Thilip at Aldre, xi, 105. Church, xii, 91.

John Goring, M.A. ; Incumbent, Bev. C. W. A. Napier, M.A., of Christchurch, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Begister, 1638. Acreage, 2,S65. Chief Landoivner, the Bev. John Goring, of Wiston House. This parish, formerly called Wistoneston, is a very pic turesque one. At the time of the Domesday Survey, William de Braose let it to Ralph ; Azor had previously held it of Earl Godwin. It had 10 hides, and there were 10 villagers and 24 bondmen. A church, 5 ministri, and a wood, producing pan nage for 30 hogs, are also mentioned. It would seem that the manor underwent a 'considerable depreciation in consequence of the Conquest, as before that event it was valued at \u00a312, but was afterwards reduced to \u00a34. Soon after the Conquest the manor was in the possession of a family called De Wistoneston, whose ancestor Mr. Cartwright considers to have been the Ralph of Domesday. About the end of the reign of Henry III. Alicia, sole heiress of William de Wistoneston, married Adam de Bavent. His son was father of another Adam who was at the celebrated siege of Carlaverock. His son Roger was summoned to Parliament in 1313. The ultimate heiress married William de Braose. From the period of the extinction of that family the Shirleys, descendants of the very ancient family of Shirley, of Eatington iu Warwickshire, held the estate for many gene rations down to the time of Thomas Shirley, M.D., who was"], [581, "261 WISTON. born in 1634. This family, which sent off branches to West Grinstead, Preston, Chiddingly, &c, was remarkable for his torical characters, especially the \"Three Brothers,\" Sir Anthony, Sir Robert, and Sir Thomas, whose exploits during the time of Elizabeth form an interesting episode in our local history, and indeed in our national annals. Their lives have been written in several forms, particularly in a monograph, by E. P. Shirley, Esq., M.A., M.P., etc., of Eatington ; in a small separate pub lication ; in the \" History of Western Sussex ;\" and in my own \" Sussex Worthies.\" The Sussex branch of the family changed the orthography of the name to Sherley. The \" Brothers \" were sons of Sir Thomas Shirley, Knight. It would be beyond the scope of this work to enter into the romance of their proceedings, except in a simple outline : \u2014 Thomas Sherley was born in 1564, and Anthony in 1565; Eobert was some years younger. In 1584 Anthony went with his father into the Low Countries, and was at the battle of Zutphen in 1586. Next we find him in Brittany, as one of Essex's Colonels against the Spaniards. His gallant service won for him the order of St. Michael from Henry IV. of France, but he thereby incurred the displeasure of Queen Elizabeth, and returned to England a poor man. He was in the expedition against the Portuguese, on the African coast, and assisted in the capture of Jamaica in 1596. Soon after this he accompanied his patron Essex to Ireland. He was again in the wars in Spain, returning to England in 1597. The following year he was in the singular mission to Persia, his object being partly religious and partly commercial. He wished the King of Persia to join the Christian powers against their common enemy the Turks, as well as to promote trading relations between the East aud West. Many were his perils on the way home. He was treated with great in- dignity by the Turks, and on the route fell into the hands of a horde of Arabs, who robbed him, but at the end of his journey the king received him as a dignified ambassador. He taught the king the English mode of casting artillery, so that ere long he had five hundred pieces of brass cannon in his army. For this service Shah Abbas created him a Mirza, or Prince. He returned to Europe in 1599, and visited the courts of Eussia, Germany, Bohemia, and finally that of Borne, where he declared himself a Roman Catholic ; but from some cause or other he left the Ponti- fical Court in disgrace, and retired to Venice. In subsequent days he underwent many other perils and adventures, but with little success in any enterprise. He was the means of introducing through Count Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, our English artillery into the Peninsular army, for which he again incurred the jealousy and displeasure of Government. He died in abject poverty, bordering sometimes on starvation. So much for the vicissitudes of this gallant knight, who had been in all the wars of his time, and had been sent diplomatically to nearly every court in Europe. His brother, Sir Robert, at the early age of 18, was with A.ithony in the wars in the Netherlands, and afterwards at Venice, in favour of Don"], [582, "262 HISTORY OF SUSSEX Cesare d'Este, against the Pope In 1598 he shared in the enterprises and honours of his brother in Persia, and remained there after his brother had returned to Europe. Shirley went by way of Poland, and was enter tained at Cracow by Sigismund III. He married Teresia, daughter of Ismael Khan, a Circassian lady. He received the honour of knighthood from the Emperor Bodolph, and was created a Count-palatine of the Em pire. He next proceeded to Borne with a suite of eighteen persons, eight of whom were Persians. He wore Persian costume, distinguishing his turban with a crucifix. Pope Paul V. received him with great state. From Borne he proceeded to Spain, and at the Spanish Court was joined by his wife, the Princess Tereria. In 1611 he came with his eastern bride to Wiston. His father, Sir Thomas Shirley, had for some time been in disfavour at Court, and to meet his liabilities to the Crown had sold the ancient family properties of West Chiltington, Erringham, and other estates, reserving only W iston, which he had settled on his wife. After a long series of further troubles he died in 1612, and was buried in the church of Wiston, where there is a black marble tablet surmounted by figures of himself and his wife. To return to Sir Bobert Shirley, he had, with his Asiatic wife, a favourable reception at the court of King James. In 1613 he again set out for Persia, taking India in his route, and paying a visit to the great Mogul. Then, after many wanderings, we find him successively at Goa, at Lisbon, and at Madrid. In 1622 he again visited Eome, and there it was that Vandyke paiuted the fine portraits of Sir Robert and the Princess Teresia, now preserved in the Petworth collection. After many struggles he returned to Persia, and there died at the age of about 50. The Princess Teresia ended her strange, eventful history by becoming a nun. The life of Sir Thomas Shirley, the eldest of this remarkable triad, was less romantic than that of his two brothers. He received his military educa tion under his father in the Netherlands. Subsequently he served in Ireland, where he was knightedinl589. He next became acourtier, and contracted a clandestine marriage with Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Vavasour, and for this offence Queen Elizabeth put him into prison for 14 weeks. At a later period he purchased two ships as privateers against the Spaniards, and captured four vessels, besides making an attack upon several villages. In 1602 he set sail from Leghorn, and was taken captive by the Turks, who carried him in chains to Constantinople. After two years' captivity, he wandered about in Italy and Germany, and arrived in England in 1606 in a state of poverty. After many other misfortunes, including imprisonment in the Tower, overwhelmed with debt, and broken in spirit, he sold Wiston and retired to the Isle of Wight, where he died. Another distinguished member of this famdy was Dr. Thomas Sherley, physician to Charles IL, born in 1638. He was a medical writer of some repute. He underwent, like so many of his ancestors, great trials and misfortunes. With him ended tbe ancient and honourable line of Sherley of Wiston \u2014 \" a family not needing hyperboles.\" To the family of Sherley suc ceeded that of Fagg, Baronets, who held Wiston for several generations, and in 1743, Elizabeth, the ultimate heiress, carried"], [583, "263 WISTON. it by marriage to AdmiwtlSir Charles Matthew| Goring, grand father of the Rev. John Goring, the present lord of Wiston. Wiston House, standing in its own deer park, was built, temp. Elizabeth, by Sir Thomas Sherley, and was a grand specimen of the style of that period, and though it has been considerably reduced in size it is still among the principal of Sussex mansions. The hall, with a very fine timber roof, is a cube of 40 feet, and the dining-room, of the date of 1576, retains much oak carving. Cartwright gives a series of inscriptions in this room, contain ing a pedigree of the family of Brewse, or Braose, for many generations. The church (St. Michael) stands near the mansion, and con sists of a nave, south aisle, and chancel. Some parts of the building are in the Decorated style, but there are traces of a much earlier date. At the east end of the aisle is a sepulchral chapel. Here is a fine brass to Sir 3fo{)n tie I3ca03f, 1426, \" pow dered with the words \" Jesu,\" \" mercy,\" with a Latin inscrip tion, which may be thus rendered : \u2014 \" Be witness, Christ ! this stone is placed, Not that my body may be graced, But that my soul remembered be ; Then, passer-by, whate'er thy time \u2014 Old age, or youth, or manhood's prime \u2014 Devoutly offer prayers for me. . . .' Under an arch in this cliapel is a stone effigy of a child, which is supposed to be for the son of this Sir John, on whose prema ture death the estate passed to the Sherleys. Tbe next monu ment in succession is that of Sir William Sherley, who is repre sented in armour, standing on a rock, with a dove sculptured above, and figures of his two wives (1551). Against the wall are the effigies of a knight in armour and his lady in a kneeling posture. This monument is to Sir Thomas Sherley, who lived in wedlock 53 years and bad 12 children, of whom nine lived to be married.

It has a Eailway station on the line between East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells. Union, East Grinstead. Population in 1811, 1,155 ; in 1861, 1,597. Benefice a Bectory, valued at \u00a3700; In- cumbent, Thomas Frederick Eudston Bead, M.A., of University College, Oxford. Date of earliest Parish Eegister, 1663. Acreage, 8,086. This extensive parish on the Forest ridge consists of arable, pasture, and woodland, and contains within its limits part of the Forest of Ashdown. It partakes of the undulating and pictur esque character of the neighbourhood. The large wood, known as the Five Hundred Acres, south of the village, is remarkably pleasing. The village chiefly consists of scattered houses, and a small tributary of the Medway passes through the parish. Withyham does not appear under any name approaching it in Domesday. A considerable portion of the parish, however, must have been included in the manor of Brochest, a corrupt spelling of the Anglo-Saxon boc-hyrst, the beech wood, or perhaps a covert for bucks (now Buckhurst). In the twelfth century this manor was the estate of the great family of De Dene, by whose heiress, Ela, it passed to Jordain de Sackville (see Bayham), and thus it descended through an illustrious line of Sackvilles to the late Duke of Dorset, whose co-heiress, Elizabeth, conveyed it by marriage, in 1813, to the late George John West, Earl De la Warr, who assumed the name of Sackville before West by royal sign-manual in 1843, and in his lordship's son it now vests. Another manor is Monkencourt, of which, in 45th Ed ward III., Gilbert Atte-Hall was lord. At a later period the Priory of Mortein in Normandy possessed it ; but having been deprived of it in the fifteenth century, during our wars with France, it was given to Sir John Pelham, who granted it for a term of years to the New Priory of Warbleton, which he had removed from Hastings, in consequence of the old establishment having been destroyed by the sea. The manor of Bullockstowne belonged to Bayham Abbey. Henry VIII., on the dissolution of that house, granted it to Wolsey, who gave it to his college at Oxford. In the reign of Elizabeth it passed to the noble family of Neville. The manor of Hendall likewise extends into the parish. Gilderedge, an ancient house and estate, gave name to a family of considerable antiquity, who subsequently had their cbief residence at Eastbourne, and gave name to the manor of Eastbourne-Gddridge. Gilderegg was originally a vicarage,"], [585, "265 WITHYHAM. annexed to Buxted, and had a chapel, but for the convenience of the inhabitants so remote from the parish church, Archbishop Peckham, in 1292, permitted it to be united with Withyham. No traces of this chapel exist. The family of Walwyn resided here, in gentle position, in the sixteenth century, as did also that of Baker (originally for many generations at Battle, and subsequently at Mayfield), who were proprietors of Gilderedge and of Ducking House in Withyham. The chief mansion and estate in the parish, however, was Buckhurst, where, temp. King John, Sir Geoffrey de Sackville was lord, holding it of the Honour of the Eagle (Pevensey). In 21st Edward I. his descendant obtained a charter of free-warren. This great family, originally lords of Sauqueville, near Dieppe in Normandy, came to England at the Conquest, and the records of the race are so generally known as to require little mention here. It produced many eminent personages, the most note worthy being Thomas Sackville, who was born at Buckhurst in 1536. After a brilliant career as scholar, poet, and statesman, he was created by Queen Elizabeth, Baron of Buckhurst, ap pointed Lord High Treasurer, and on the accession of James I. he was continued in office, and created Earl of Dorset. He died while sitting at the council-table at Whitehall in 1608, and the obsequies having been performed in Westminster Abbey, his body was brought to Withyham for interment among his an cestors. For a memoir, see \" Worthies of Sussex,\" p. 187. His son Robert, second Earl of Dorset, inherited much of his father's learning, but died shortly after his coming to the title, and was buried at Withyham, beneath a splendid monument. His best monument, however, is \" Sackvil College for the Poor,\" at East Grinstead, founded by his wid. (See East Grinstead.) Another descendant was Charles, the sixth Earl of Dorset, K.G., the well known courtier and man of taste, in literature and art. He went to Holland as a volunteer at the commencement of the Dutch war, in 1665, and the night before his departure, composed the well-known song, \" To all you Ladies now on Land.\" He died in 1706, and also found sepulture at Withyham. (See \" Wor thies \"ut supra.) The present Lord Buckhurst (late the Hon. and Rev. Reginald Sackvide-West) in his \" Parochial History of Withyham,\" has given an account of the descent of this very ancient line, and of their monuments in the church. Buck hurst House, once a very lordly abode, measuring 260 feet by 200, with a capacious quadrangle, hall, and chapel, and partly sur rounded by a moat, having been deserted for the still more majestic residence of Knole,near Sevenoaks, was permitted to fall to ruin, and part of its materials were employed for the erec tion of Sackville College. The solitary survivor of so much"], [586, "266 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. te magnificence is the gateway tower. The family, however, did not whody neglect their ancient abode, but built in the park, on the site of a keeper's lodge, a competent mansion, which was finished by the first Duke of Dorset, and leased to his son, Lord George Germain, afterwards Viscount Sackville. Still later various members of the family, and the late Eirl and Countess De la Warr, have made it their occasional residence. It was for merly called Stoneland, but now Buckhurst Park. The grounds are beautifully laid out. The church (St. Michael) was partially burnt down by lightning 16th June, 1663. The lightning is stated to have entered \" at the steeple, melted the bells, and proceeded to the chancel, where it tore the monuments of the Dorset family to pieces.\" There is some exaggeration here, though the damage done to the fabric alone was estimated at \u00a31,800. Among the memorials destroyed were a brass for J^umftg _5aftcb:DlC, Esq. ,1488, and a monument re presenting kneeling figures of Richard Sacke vile, Esq., Isabel, his wife, with their four sons and six daughters \u2014 date 1524. The reparations of the church are said to have been completed about 1680. The building, as it now stands, consists of chancel, nave, with south aisle, and porch, a large chapel on the north side of the chancel, and a massive embattled west tower, with six bells. In the chancel are three sedilia and a piscina. There are features of Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. The north aisle was destroyed by the fire. The Buckhurst Chapel is Late Perpendicular. The principal existing monuments are \u2014 1, an altar tomb with recumbent effigies of an infant, and standing figures of the father and mother. In relief on the sides of the monument are figures of other children. This is for Richard, Earl of Dorset, 1677, and Frances, his Countess, and their family \u2014 2. a monument by Nollekens, for John Frederick, Duke of Dorset, 1799 \u2014 3. another, by Flaxman, for George John Fre derick, last Duke of Dorset, kided by a fall from his horse, just after his majority, in 1815 \u2014 and 4. a monument, by Chan trey, for Arabella Diana, Duchess of Dorset, 1825. There are also memorials for Charles, Earl of Dorset, KG., 1705, and for the names of Pennington, Gray, and Alfrey. The last two are iron slabs, 1582 and 1610.

Acreage, 1,260. This small parish is of very irregular outline. Its southern boundary is Bracklesham Bay, which (owing to the flatness of the country near Wittering, and the nature of the soil) has eaten away a considerable portion of the parish. In fact, the greater part of what was East Wittering is now submerged in the Bay. In compensation of this damage there are fine sands for the pedestrian, and an admirable field of observation for the geolo gist, as some fossils of great rarity are to be found here. Soon after the Conquest, a family, who were then owners, took their name from this village. In 11th Henry VIII., Sir John Dawtrey was in possession, and his family were succeeded by that of Ernley. There are three prebendal manors either partly or wholly in this parish, viz. : Bracklesham, East Thorney, and Somerley. A farm of 100 acres, called Stubcroft, formerly sup ported a chantry in St. Michael's chapel at Chiehester. There was also a chapel which was annexed to the vicarage in 1518, by Bishop Sherburne. The church (St. John) is a small building, with Norman fea tures, and consists of a nave and chancel, with a belfry of wood, and one bell. [S. A. C. Boman road at Bracklesham, xi, 127.

The country is flat, but commands very picturesque marine views. Westringes is mentioned in Domesday as being in the obsolete hundred of the same name. It is said to belong to Earl Roger (de Montgomeri),"], [588, "268 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. but it is stated in another part of the record that the Bishop held it. Probably there were two manors belonging to these respec tive proprietors ; there is no doubt that West Wittering was an episcopal manor from the time of Edilwalch, King of Sussex, who granted it in 673 to the see of Selsey. Cakeham manor house, the occasional residence of the Bishops from the 13th to the 16th century, was a spacious mansion with its hall, chapel, and other considerable apartments. It was a favourite abode of Bishop Sherburne, who erected a lofty hexagonal brick tower, early in the 16th century. The family of Atte Fenne or Fenner, of Crawley, held considerable lands in the parish during the Tudor period. Daniel Whitby, D.D., held the prebend of Wittering in 1660 ; he was a controversial writer against the Roman Catholics, and died in 1726. The prebendal estate was long held by the trustees of Oliver Whitby, Esq., founder of the free-school at Chiehester. According to Pope Nicholas' taxation, 1290, the vicarage was valued at 20 marks, and in the Non\u00e6-roll, 1341, at the same sum, though it is declared that so much arable land had been absorbed by the sea that the value was lessened 7 marks. Much grass had also been devoured by the rabbits of the Bishop \u2014 no new complaint ! The church (St. Peter and St. Paul) is thus described by Horsfield. \" It exhibits portions of architecture of the 13th and 14th centuries. The tower stands detached from the nave, and on the north side. Three stalls of oak, with misereres orna mented with rosettes, are preserved in the chancel, as also a monument of Caen stone, partly mural and partly projecting. The bas-reliefs represent the Resurrection, and the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. It has no inscription upon it, but the arms of Ernley appropriate it to William Ernley, Esq., who was resi dent at Cakeham, 28th Henry VIII., and died in 1545.

The \"field\" or \"clearing\" of Wivel (a Saxon personal name, still existing as a surname*), is pleasantly situated near the Forest-ridge, in a picturesque district. The manor of Otehall gave name to the family of De Otehall, in the 14th century or earlier. At subsequent dates the owners were Kentish, Atteze, Michelborne, and Godman. The Godman heiress conveyred it by marriage to a junior branch of the Shirley family of Wiston, about the beginning of the 18th century. Of this family was Lieut. -General Widiam Shirley, Governor of Massachusets Bay in 1741, and afterwards ofthe Bahama Islands. His son, Major- General Thomas Shirley, was created Baronet of Otehall in 1 786, but with his son, Sir William Warden Shirley, who died in 1815, the title became extinct. Late in the last century it was pur chased by William Tanner, Esq., in whose descendants it still vests. A considerable part of the old mansion built in 1600 by Thomas Godman still remains. In the windows there were formerly the arms of its successive possessors. During the Shirley proprietorship, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, foun dress of the well-known religious \" Connexion,\" resided here for some time, and the Rev. William Romaine, the celebrated divine, frequently preached in the house. Temp. John and Henry III., the Bardolf s had the manor of Wivelsfield, and temp. Henry VI. it belonged to Thomas Beaufort. Franklands has successively passed in and since the Tudor period to Mascall, Bray, Pope, Luxford, Woodyer, Warden, Sergison, and Tanner. More House,- which has the remains of a moat, gave name to the family of At-More or Moore. One of this family was at Agincourt, and another was Capt. Thomas More, an eminent loyalist during Cromwell's government. From the Mores the estate descended through the Middletons and Fullers to the Tanners. Fanners, an ancient bouse, has been modern ized, and is now called \" The Ferns.\" The picturesque little church of St John the Baptist, was anciently a chapel of Ditchling. \" From its peculiar position, * Wivelsie\u00ab is also the name of a farm at no great distance."], [590, "270 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. it has been sadly patched and neglected, but still retains inter esting features. It comprises nave, with south aisle and chancel, south porch, and a square tower with shingled cap at the west end of the aisle. The chancel contains a piscina, which was used as a cupboard! and what appears like a sepulchral arch in the north wall. In the south chancel (or chantry) are a trefoil-headed piscina and aumbry. The walls of the building seem to be Norman and Transition Norman ; the north door early Norman, and the south door Perpendicular. At least the lower part of the tower is Decorated, with Perpendicular windows higher up. The church is so mutilated that its character is difficult to de cipher ; the piers and arches between the nave and aisle, as also the chancel, exhibit some traces of the Early English style.\" Thus writes Mr. Hussey in 1852, but in 1869, 70, the building underwent judicious restoration and repair, the chancel was lengthened, and a new north aisle added; and now the building mayr claim to rank among the most picturesque of small churches in East Sussex. There are memorials to the names of Richbell, More, Middleton, Holey, &c. The bells are five in number, one of which is dedicated to St. Augustine. Popular tradition calls this William Rufus's bell ! In this parish stands the Hay ward's Heath County Lunatic Asylum. The buildings are very extensive, and occupy a com manding site. The interior arrangements are calculated to promote as far as possible the comfort of the unhappy inmates. There is a chapel, the incumbent of which is the Rev. Thomas Cradan, M.A. The resident master and physician ofthe estab lishment is S. W. D. Williams, Esq., M.D. The asylum was erected in 1857-9, and subsequent additions have been made, the cost from first to last having been nearly \u00a370,000. The number of patients is (alas !) upwards of 500. [S. A. C. Parish register, iv, 259. Church to Lewes Priory, xiii, 244. Ote-Hall ( Turner) xiii, 247. Families of Godman, Shirley, Tanner, ibid.

Woodmancote is doubtless neither more nor less than the \" Cote, or abode, of the Woodman,\" who before and long since the Conquest, would have ample scope for his axe in this well wooded locality. In the time of Edward the Confessor, the Countess Goda held the manor, and Domesday describes it as afterwards held of William de Braose by William Fitzralph. Its subsequent history is very obscure. Early in the seven teenth century it was possessed by the family of West, origi nally from Berkshire. In 1691, Walter West, the representative, sold it to Thomas Dennett, Esq., of an ancient family in this parish, with whose descendant it still remains, Woodmancote place being the seat of J. L. W. Dennett, Esq. Mr. Cartwright considers the name of Dennett, or Dennatt, an inversion of the ancient At Dene, which existed at Woodmancote in 1341. De la Dene, a still older form of the name, is found there in 1298. The rectory house, with its attached glebe, is superior to most in the district. The church consists of nave and chancel, and has an east window of temp. Henry VI. (Cartwright.) ; also another window containing two shields of the fourteenth century : 1, Chequy, Arg. and Az. on a canton Gules, a cross moline Or ; 2, Azure, six mullets, 3, 2 and 1 , Or. The latter is the coat of Graundyn, a family connected in 1330 with Wickham, in Steyning. The font is Norman, and square. There are memorials for the names of Dennett, Blithman, and Shore. A church is mentioned here in Domesdajr. In 1555, Thomas Harland, carpenter, and John Oswald, hus bandman, both of this village, were burnt at Lewes for Protes tantism. [S. A. C.

Saxon Wul-laving-ton, a superior pasture for sheep, with the adjunct of lavant a source of water ; sed dubito. The parish consists of several disjecta membra, which Dallaway distinguishes as Old Lavington, Dangstone, Midhurst division, and Farnhurst division. It is curious how such a distribution of a parish could have occurred. Domesday informs us that Loventone was held of Earl Godwin, by another Godwin, and by Ivo of Earl Roger de Montgomeri. The aggregate was nine hides, the value being \u00a38. There were 10 villeins, and 10 bordars. The manor was afterwards the possession of the great families of D'Albini and Fitz-Alan, and is now considered as part of the Honour of Pet worth. There was a staurum of cattle and sheep belonging to the lord, with a park. At later dates, it belonged to the Lum leys and Gartens, and passed in succession to the Ormes ancl Sargents. In 31st Elizabeth, the Gartens built a large mansion with towers at the angles. The existing residence on a smaller scale, though still elegant and commodious, was completed in 1794, by John Sargent, Esq. The arms of the successive pro prietors are displayed on the front. It is delightfully situated, and has fine grounds, gardens, and a park, with most exten sive and agreeable views. Mr. A. E. Knox in his work, \" Game-birds,\" &c, speaks ofthe \"dark hanging woods of Lavington,\" which clothe the steep South Down hills, and of the accompanying clumps of beech and juniper, and of the picturesque valley of the Rother, and the circumjacent \"heath ery commons, evergreen woods, brown copses, and cultivated fields.\" The church (St. Peter), though of early date, is small and unimpoitant, and contains little of interest. In the western division of the parish a new church has recently been erected, and is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen. In the churchyard is the grave of the late Richard Cobden, the eminent politician and statist. In connection with this parish must be mentioned the names of two possessors of the estate, the late John Sargent, Esq., author of the \" Mine,\" and other poems, and Dr. Wilberforce, long Bishop of Oxford, and now of Winchester.

The ancient manor-house for some time the residence of Charlotte Smith, the poetess, was much enlarged and modernized in the last generation by Lord Robert Spencer. It now belongs to the Hon. George and Mrs. Ponsonby. The church, dedicated to Allhallows, has been much altered and repaired at different periods. The tower and chancel were rebuilt in the last century. Sir Henry Mill, the eighth Baronet, when rector, placed in the chancel window some singular painted glass removed from Mottisfont Priory, in Hampshire. The font is of great antiquity and bed-shaped. One of the three bells is inscribed to St. Margaret. There are memorials for Lord and Lady Robert Spencer, and for various members of the family of Mill, &c. [S. A. C. Domesday water-mill, v, 272.

This large and interesting parish derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon, and signifies land, farm, street, hall, &c. (Bosworth.) It is a border parish adjoining Surrey on the north. The soil is generally poor and unproductive, yet abound- \u00abg with birch and other woods, and is full of picturesque un- dations. The ancient Forest of Worth, formerly one of the principal woodland districts of the county, extends into several adjacent parishes, and from a survey made in 1583, it contained upwards of 5,000 acres. Tilgate Forest, so famous for its fossil remains, was formei^fcconsidered parcel of the Forest of Worth. The parish contains many private residences of importance, but the village is a straggling and inconsiderable place. There are several seats which have belonged to gentle families . connected with the county. Crabbet Park was the abode of the Smiths, descended from the Smiths, of Shelford, co.Warwick ; and afterwards of the Blunts. Gibsaven was long the estate of a branch ofthe Thorpes, of Newdigate in Surrey ; and Huntland was tbe property of tbe Edwards family from 1550, and they held it for more than 150 years. Rowfant, an old stone mansion, after having passed through several families, came into the hands of the Rev. George M. Bethune, LL.D., rector of Worth. Fenn Place, a house of considerable antiquity gave name to the family of Atte Fenne, or Fenner, and came to the Bysshes and Shelleys. The impulse given to the erection and enlargement of con siderable houses in this part of the Weald by the opening of the London and Brighton Railway has conduced to make Worth, with its bracing air and picturesque scenery, a very favourite settling place for gentle f amides, who have either purchased or leased residences within the last few years. Among these may be mentioned \u2014 Rowfant, Sir Curtis M. Lampson, Bart.; Tilgate manor, John Nix, Esq.; Huntsland, J. Russell Reeves, Esq.; Crabbet Park, George Smith, Esq.; Worth Lodge, George Latham, Esq.; The Grange, George Lilley, Esq.; Worth Park, Joseph M. Montefiore, Esq.; Oakfield, Rev. William Henry Hoare; The Grove, Edwin Martin, Esq.; Copthorne, William Fennings, Esq.; The Rectory, Rev. George Wilson Banks, &c. These are all situated in beautiful grounds, mostly with the adjuncts of excellent forest scenery, and pieces of water. There are also several hamlets, including Turner's Hill, Three Bridges, and Copthorne. Worth is not mentioned in Domesday, and the history of its manor, or rather several manors, is difficult to narrate. For some time after the Conquest the greater portion of what is"], [595, "WORTH 275 now the parish was for the most part an unreclaimed forest, in- cluding the two districts afterwards known as Worth Forest and Tilgate Forest, which were here and there interspersed with glades and parks, and everywhere wed suited for the purposes of the chase. It was in early times part of the great territory of the Earls of Warenne, and in 7th Edward L, John, Earl of Warenne, Lord of Lewes Rape, being questioned by the justices itinerant as to his claim for this and other lands, stated that he and his ancestors had alwas been faithful to the Kings of England ; that they had lost their French possessions for their adherence to King John against the King of France, and moreover as his name was Warenne he claimed the right of free- warren over his English manors, so that he may be said to have held them by ;;>M?i-hold ! (See Bosham.) John, the last Earl, died possessed in 1347, and the chief lordship seems to have passed like the barony of Lewes to the noble families of Fitz-Alan and Bergavenny. The principal manor lost its name of Worth, and became known as Heighleigh. After several changes we find it associated with the names of Sherley, Caryll, Covert, Middle- ton, Fowle, Newnham, and others. Several families of distinction, besides those already men- tioned, have been associated with Worth. Some of the members of these families were iron-masters of considerable importance, especially the Gales, who sprang from a blacksmith at Seven- oaks, and carried on large iron-works in this part of the county. Interesting memoirs of the family have been edited by R. W. Blencowe, Esq., in the \" Sussex Collections.\" In 1698, Leo- nard Gale, Esq., purchased Crabbet, which had been held by the Norman family of Playz, and afterwards by that of Moore, of Odiham, in Hampshire, and by them by a re-marriage of the widow of the last of their race to the Smiths, of Shelford. The three co-heiresses married Blunt, Clitherowe, and Humphrey. The Whitfelds, of Rowfant, originally from Alston-Moor, in Cumberland, and afterwards of Wadhurst and Worth, were great iron-masters in the sixteenth century. The church is one of the most remarkable in England, both for the peculiarity of its form and its great antiquity. It stands on elevated ground in a large church-yard, which is entered from the north-west by an ancient lich gate. The building is cruciform, and consists of nave, north and south transepts, and a chancel with a circular apse. Over the north transept is a wooden bell-chamber with a dwarf shingled spire, which rests on four large wooden uprights within, which present a singular appearance. Mr. W. S. Walford, who has given a critical account of the building in \" Sussex Codections,\" admits its Saxon origin, and this is generady thought to be the case. The t 2"], [596, "276 HISTORY OF SUSSEX. edifice has been so much patched with insertions of different dates, aud the addition of buttresses of extreme ugliness, that no brief 'description of it would be intelligible. The most re markable portion of it is the chancel, which is approached by a semi-circular arch of extremely rude work. The font is curious and ancient, and really consists of two fonts placed one upon the other, both being probably of the 13th century. The arms of De Warenne are found in one of the windows. There are monuments and inscriptions for the families of Gale, Smith, Bysshe (of Fenne Place) Shelley, Smith, Whitfeld, Goodwin, Bethune, Towers, and many others.* [S.A.C.

A recent writer designates it \"a pleasant broad-streeted watering-place, ' discovered ' some time before Brighton, but not destined to attain the dimensions of that marine London.\" Although a Domesday manor, and a recognized hamlet of Broadwater from early times, its condition was that of an inconsiderable fishing village, and so continued until the last century. The first \"fashionable \" impulse was given to it by a visit, shortly before 1800, of the Princess Amelia. Since then it has been the temporary abode ofthe Princess Charlotte, Queen Caroline, and Queen Adelaide. Its situation on the English Channel, with its pleasant long range of sands, extending four miles to the east and nine to the west, and forming what is called Worthing Point, with the known salubrity of its climate, have rendered the town a favourite resort. The site is, for the most part, flat and monotonous ; but as it is sheltered on the north by a delightful strip of South Downs, and is within the reach of much good scenery and many objects of interest, few places on the South Coast are more attractive than Worthing, especially for those who seek a quiet sea-side resort. From the new iron * Since this article was written, great alterations have been made in the building ; whether they are improvements I am unable to say."], [597, "277 WORTHING. pier there is a commanding sea view, extending from the Isle of Wight to Beachy Head. The town is furnished with every appliance for the lounger and the invalid, but for these matters the local \" guides \" must be consulted. The town is fast increas ing in size, and a recent extension of it is called West Worthing. The manor is described in Domesday under the name of Ordinges. Seven allodial tenants had held it under Earl Godwin as 11 hides, but, after the Conquest, Robert held it of William de Braose, lord of Bramber. There were six villeins, nine bond men, and a serf. In the time of the Confessor and afterwards it was rated at 100s. Another manor called Wordinges was held in Saxon times by Leiven and afterwards by Robert. Although it was assessed at only half a hide and valued at 12s., it had a videin and five bondmen. Ralph held half a hide worth 5s. In later times the manor of Worthing was granted to the Priory of Easebourne, and at the Dissolution passed among the posses sions of that house to Henry Fitzwilliam, Earl of Southampton, who, in 34th Henry VIII., bequeathed it with his other estates to his half-brother, Sir Anthony Browne, and it passed, like Cowdray, to the Viscounts Montague and their heritrix Elizabeth, wife of Wdliam S. Poyntz, Esq. In 1219 Widiam Berneus granted to Dyonisia his mother, for her life, a hide of land at Wyrddingg, at the rent of a horse-load of salt, which shows the existence of salt-pans here. The sea encroached much on the coast, and the hamlet now contains little more than 300 acres. The principal proprietors of it were successively Wade, Booker, Luther, the Earl of Warwick, Commered, Ogle, Barrington (Bishop of Durham), and Colberg. A chapel existed at Worth ing from early times, but of its site nothing is remembered. In 1409 the Bishop of Chiehester granted permission for masses, &c, to be performed in this chapel, saving the rights of the mother church of Broadwater. The existing episcopalian places of worship are the chapel of ease, built in 1812, (value \u00a3150), and held by the Rev. William Read, M.A., of St. John's Codege, Cambridge ; Christ Church, built in 1843, with a benefice, worth \u00a3300, is held by the Rev. F. Cruse, B.A., of St. Edmond Hall, Oxford ; and a new church has been quite recently erected at the east end of the town. The patronage of these is vested in the Rector of Broadwater. A new Roman-Catholic church and a nunnery have been founded here ; and there are chapels for several dissenting denominations. Roman urns, pottery, and coins of Dioclesian and Constantine have been discovered within the present century. [S. A. C. Eoman coins, i, 26. Smugglers, x, 93. Tortington Priory lands, xi, 110.

Its manorial history is of no interest. It belonged to the Honour of Arundel, until it was sold in 1571 by Henry Fitz-Alan, to John Edmundes, Esq., whose descendant, Charity in the fifth generation conveyed it in marriage to Law rence Ediott, of Busbridge in Surrey, and died in 1716, S.P. In 1759 it passed by purchase to George Thomas, Esq., afterwards created a Baronet. His daughter Margery married Arthur Freeman, Esq , whose son Inigo Freeman-Thomas, afterwards of Ratton in Widingdon, inherited. The old mansion house of the famdy of Edmundes was partly rebuilt and added to in 1800. Balsham, the Bilesham of Domesday, in the southern part of the parish, was originally a hamlet and chapelry : the chapel now forms a double cottage for labourers, and has an ancient door and three buttresses. The manor, with that of Vapton and the advowson of the church, was given by Richard, Earl of Arundel, to the foundation of Arundel College. The priories of Shulbrede and Tortington also had good lands here. The church has a nave and aisles, \"of the style prevalent in the reign of Henry III., with a low tower at the west end. The chancel has been rebuilt.\" (Dallaway.) The font is ancient and curious. Of the four bells one is ancient with the inscription \" Ave Maria.\" The mortuary inscriptions refer to the families of Barnard, Roe, Thomas, Sydserfe, White, Page, &c. \u2014 Yapton probably signifies the tun or settlement of Eappa, a recognized Saxon personal name.
