In the course of occasional visits to Canada many years since, I became intimately acquainted with some of the principal partners of the great North-West Fur Company, who at that time lived in genial style at Montreal, and kept almost open house for the stranger. At their hospi table boards I occasionally met with partners, and clerks, and hardy fur traders from the interior posts ; men who had passed years remote from civilized society; among distant and savage tribes, and who had wonders to recount of their wide and wild peregrinations, their hunting exploits, and their perilous adventures and hair breadth escapes among the Indians. I was at an age when the imagination lends its coloring to every thing, and the stories of these Sinbads of the wilderness made the life of a trapper and fur trader perfect romance to me. I even meditated at one time a visit to the remote posts of the company in the boats which annually ascended the lakes and rivers, being thereto invited by one of the part ners ; and I have ever since regretted that I was prevented by circumstances from carrying my intention into effect"], [12, "4 INTRODUCTION. From those early impressions, the grand enterprises of the great fur companies, and the hazardous errantry of then associates in the wild parts of our vast continent, have always been themes of charmed interest to me ; and I have felt anxious to get at the details of their adventurous expeditions among the savage tribes that peopled the depths of the wilderness. About two years ago, not long after my return from a tour upon the prairies of the far west, I had a conversation with my friend Mr. John Jacob Astor, relative to that por tion of our country, and to the adventurous traders to Santa Fe and the Columbia. This led him to advert to a great enterprize set on foot and conducted by him, between twenty and thirty years since, having for its object to carry the fur trade across the Rocky Mountains, and to sweep the shores of the Pacific. Finding that I took an interest in the subject, he ex pressed a regret that the true nature and extent of his enterprise and its national character and importance had never been understood, and a wish that I would undertake to give an account of it. The suggestion struck upon the chord of early associations, already vibrating in my mind. It occurred to me that a work of this kind might comprise a variety of those curious details, so interesting to me, illustrative of the fur trade ; of its remote and adventurous enterprises, and of the various people, and tribes, and castes, and characters, civilized and savage, affected by its operations. The journals, and letters also, of the adven turers by sea and land employed by Mr. Astor in his com prehensive project, might throw light upon portions of our"], [13, "5 INTRODUCTION. country quite out of the track of ordinary travel, and as yet but little known. I therefore felt disposed to under take the task, provided documents of sufficient extent and minuteness could be furnished to me. All the papers relative to the enterprise were accordingly submitted to my inspection. Among them were journals and letters narrating expeditions by sea, and journeys to and fro across the Rocky Mountains by routes before untravelled, together with documents illustrative of savage and colonial life on the borders of the Pacific. With such materials in hand, I undertook the work. The trouble of rummaging among business papers, and of collecting and collating facts from amidst tedious and common-place details, was spared me by my nephew, Pierre M. Irving, who acted as my pioneer, and to whom I am greatly indebted for smoothing my path and lightening my labors. As the journals, on which I chiefly depended, had been kept by men of business, intent upon the main object of the enterprise, and but little versed in science, or curious about matters not immediately bearing upon their interests, and as they were written often in moments of fatigue or hurry, amid the inconveniences of wild encampments, they were often meagre in their details, furnishing hints to provoke rather than narratives to satisfy inquiry. I have, therefore, availed myself occasionally of collateral lights supplied by the published journals of other travellers who have visited the scenes described : such as Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, Bradbury, Breckenridge, Long, Franchere, and Ross Cox, and make a general acknowledgment of aid received from these quarters. I*"], [14, "6 INTRODUCTION. The work I here present to the public, is necessarily of a rambling and somewhat disjointed nature, comprising various expeditions and adventures by land and sea. The facts, however, will prove to be linked and banded together by one grand scheme, devised and conducted by a master spirit ; one set of characters, also, continues throughout, appearing occasionally, though sometimes at long inter vals, and the whole enterprise winds up by a regular catastrophe ; so that the work, without any labored attempt at artificial construction, actually possesses much of that unity so much sought after in works of fiction, and con sidered so important to the interest of every history."], [15, "CONTENTS of the FIRST VOLUME.

Two leading objects of commercial gain have given birth to wide and daring enterprise in the early history of the Americas ; the precious metals of the south, and the rich peltries of the north. While the fiery and magnificent Spaniard, inflamed with the mania for gold, has extended his discoveries and con quests over those brilliant countries scorched by the ardent sun of the tropics, the adroit and buoyant Frenchman, and the cool and calculating Briton, have pursued the less splendid, but no less lucrative, traffic in furs amidst the hyperborean regions of the Canadas, until they have advanced even within the Arctic circle. 2"], [22, "14 FRENCH CANADIAN SETTLERS. These two pursuits have thus in a manner been the pioneers and precursors of civilization. Without pausing on the bor ders, they have penetrated at once, in defiance of difficulties and dangers, to the heart of savage countries : laying open the hidden secrets of the wilderness ; leading the way to re mote regions of beauty and fertility that might have remained unexplored for ages, and beckoning after them the slow and pausing steps of agriculture and civilization. It was the fur trade, in fact, which gave early sustenance and vitality to the great Canadian provinces. Being destitute of the precious metals, at that time the leading objects of Amer ican enterprise, they were long neglected by the parent country. The French adventurers, however, who had settled on the banks of the St. Lawrence, soon found that in the rich peltries of the interior, they had sources of wealth that might almost rival the mines of Mexico and Peru. The Indians, as yet unacquainted with the artificial value given to some descrip tions of furs, in civilized life, brought quantities of the most precious kinds and bartered them away for European trinkets and cheap commodities. Immense profits were thus made by the early traders, and the traffic was pursued with avidity. As the valuable furs soon became scarce in the neighbor hood of the settlements, the Indians of the vicinity were stimu lated to take a wider range in their hunting expeditions ; they were generally accompanied on these expeditions by some of the traders or their dependants, who shared in the toils and perils of the chase, and at the same time made themselves acquainted with the best hunting and trapping grounds, and with the re mote tribes, whom they encouraged to bring their peltries to the settlements. In this way the trade augmented and was drawn from remote quarters to Montreal. Every now and then a large body of Ottawas, Hurons, and other tribes who"], [23, "15 INDIAN TRADING CAMP. hunted the countries bordering on the great lakes, would come down in a squadron of light canoes, laden with beaver skins, and other spoils of their year's hunting. The canoes would be unladen, taken on shore, and their contents disposed in order. A camp of birch bark would be pitched outside of the town, and a kind of primitive fair opened with that grave cere monial so dear to the Indians. An audience would be de manded of the governor-general, who would hold the con ference with becoming state, seated in an elbow chair, with the Indians ranged in semicircles before him, seated on the ground, and silently smoking their pipes. Speeches would be made, presents exchanged, and the audience would break up in universal good humor. Now would ensue a brisk traffic with the merchants, and all Montreal would be alive with naked Indians running from shop to shop bargaining for arms, kettles, knives, axes, blankets, bright-colored cloths, and other articles of use or fancy ; upon all which, says an old French writer, the merchants were sure to clear at least two hundred per cent. There was no money used in this traffic, and, after a time, all payment in spirituous liquors was prohibited, in consequence of the frantic and frightful excesses and bloody brawls which they were apt to occasion. Their wants and caprices being supplied, they would take leave of the governor, strike their tents, launch their canoes, and ply their way up the Ottawa to the lakes. A new and anomalous class of men gradually grew out of this trade. These were called coureurs des bois, rangers of the woods ; originally men who had accompanied the Indians in their hunting expeditions and made themselves acquainted with remote tracts and tribes ; and who now be came, as it were, pedlars of the wilderness. These men"], [24, "16 COUREURS DES BOIS. would set out from Montreal with canoes well stocked with goods, with arms and ammunition, and would make their way up the mazy and wandering rivers that interlace the vast forests of the Canadas, coasting the most remote lakes, and creating new wants and habitudes among the natives. Some times they sojourned for months among them, assimilating to their tastes and habits with the happy facility of Frenchmen ; adopting in some degree the Indian dress, and not unfrequently taking to themselves Indian wives. Twelve, fifteen, eighteen months would often elapse without any tidings of them, when they would come sweeping their way down the Ottawa in full glee, their canoes laden down with packs of beaver skins. Now came their turn for revelry and extravagance. \" You would be amazed,\" says an old writer already quoted, \" if you saw how lewd these pedlars are when they return ; how they feast and game, and how prodigal tbey are not only in their clothes, but upon their sweethearts. Such of them as are married have the wisdom to retire to their own houses ; but the bachelors act just as an East Indiaman and pirates are wont to do ; for they lavish, eat, drink, and play all away as long as the goods hold out ; and when these are gone, they even sell their embroidery, their lace and their clothes. This done they are forced upon a new voyage for subsistence.\"* Many of these coureurs des bois became so accustomed to the Indian mode of living, and the perfect freedom of the wilderness, that they lost all relish for civilization, and iden tified themselves with the savages among whom they dwelt, or could only be distinguished from them by superior licen tiousness. Their conduct and example gradually corrupted the natives, and impeded the works of the Catholic missionaries, * La Hontan, v. i, let. 4."], [25, "LICENSED TRADERS 17 who were at this time prosecuting their pious labors in the wilds of Canada. To check these abuses, and to protect the fur trade from various irregularities practised by these loose adventurers, an order was issued by the French government prohibiting all persons, on pain of death, from trading into the interior of the country without a license. These licenses were granted in writing by the governor general, and at first were given only to persons of respecta bility ; to gentlemen of broken fortunes ; to old officers of the army who had families to provide for ; or to their widows. Each license permitted the fitting out of two large canoes with merchandise for the lakes, and no more than twenty-five licenses were to be issued in one year. By degrees, how ever, private licenses were also granted, and the number rapidly increased. Those who did not choose to fit out the expedi tions themselves, were permitted to sell them to the mer chants ; these employed the coureurs des bois, or rangers of the woods, to undertake the long voyages on shares, and thus the abuses of the old system were revived and continued.* + The following are the terms on which these expeditions were commonly undertaken. The merchant holding the license would fit out the two canoes with a thousand crowns worth of goods, and put them under the conduct of six coureurs des bois, to whom the goods were charged at the rate of fifteen per cent above the ready money price in the colony. The coureurs des bois, in their turn dealt so sharply with the savages, that they gener ally returned at the end of a year or so, with four canoes well laden, so as to ensure a clear profit of seven hundred per cent, insomuch that the thousand crowns invested, produced eight thousand. Of this extravagant profit the merchant had the lion's share. In the first place he would set aside six hundred crowns for the cost of his license, then a thousand crowns for the cost of the original merchandise. This would leave six thousand four hundred crowns from which he would take forty per cent for bottomry, amounting to two thousand five hundred and sixty crowns. The residue would be equally divided among the six wood rangers, who would thus receive little more than six hundred crowns for all their toils and perils. 2*"], [26, "18 A FRENCH TRADING POST. The pious missionaries employed by the Roman CathoUc Church to convert the Indians, did every thing in their power to counteract the profligacy caused and propagated by these men in the heart of the wilderness. The Catholic chapel might often be seen planted beside the trading house, and its spire surmounted by a cross, towering from the midst of an Indian village on the banks of a river or a lake. The missions had often a beneficial effect on the simple sons of the forest, but had little power over the renegades from civilization. At length it was found necessary to establish fortified posts at the confluence of the rivers and the lakes for the protec tion of the trade, and the restraint of these profligates of the wilderness. The most important of these was at Michilimack inac, situated at the strait of the same name, which connects lakes Huron and Michigan. It became the great interior mart and place of deposit, and some of the regular merchants, who prosecuted the trade in person, under their licenses, formed establishments here. This, too, was a rendezvous for the rangers of the woods, as well those who came up with goods from Montreal as those who returned with peltries from the interior. Here new expeditions were fitted out and took their departure for lake Michigan and the Mississippi ; lake Superior and the north-west ; and here the peltries brought in return were embarked for Montreal. The French merchant at his trading post, in these primitive days of Canada, was a kind of commercial patriarch. With the lax habits and easy familiarity of his race, he had a little world of self-indulgence and misrule around him. He had his clerks, canoe-men and retainers of all kinds, who lived with him on terms of perfect sociability, always calling him by his christian name ; he had his harem of Indian beauties,"], [27, "BRITISH FUR TRADERS. 19 and his troop of half-breed children ; nor was there ever wanting a louting train of Indians, hanging about the estab lishment, eating and drinking at his expense in the intervals of their hunting expeditions. The Canadian traders, for a long time, had troublesome com petitors in the British merchants of New York, who inveigled the Indian hunters and the coureurs des bois, to their posts, and traded with them on more favorable terms. A still more formidable opposition was organized in the Hudson Bay Com pany, chartered by Charles II, in 1670, with the exclusive privilege of establishing trading houses on tbe shores of that bay and its tributary rivers ; a privilege which they have main tained to the present day. Between this British Company and the French merchants of Canada, feuds and contests arose about alleged infringements of territorial limits, and acts of violence and bloodshed occurred between their agents. In 1762, the French lost possession of Canada, and the trade fell principally into the hands of British subjects. For a time, however, it shrunk within narrow limits. The old coureurs des bois were broken up and dispersed, or, where they could be met with, were slow to accustom themselves to the habits and manners of their British employers. They missed the freedom, indulgence, and familiarity of the old French trading houses, and did not relish the sober exactness, reserve, and method of the new comers. The British traders, too, were ignorant of the country, and distrustful of the natives. They had reason to be so. The treacherous and bloody affairs of Detroit and Michilimackinac showed them the lurking hos tility cherished by the savages, who had too long been taught by the French to regard them as enemies. It was not until the year 1766, that the trade regained its old channels ; but it was then pursued with much avidity and"], [28, "20 RISE OF THE NORTH-WEST COMPANY emulation by individual merchants, and soon transcended its former bounds. Expeditions were fitted out by various persons from Montreal and Michilimackinac, and rivalships and jealousies of course ensued. The trade was injured by their artifices to outbid and undermine each other ; the Indians were debauched by the sale of spirituous liquors, which had been prohibited under the French rule. Scenes of drunkenness, brutality, and brawl were the consequence, in the Indian villages and around the trading houses, while bloody feuds took place between rival trading parties when they happened to encounter each other in the lawless depths of tbe wilderness. To put an end to these sordid and ruinous contentions, several of the principal merchants of Montreal entered into a partnership in the winter of 1783, which was augmented by amalgamation with a rival company in 1787. Thus was created the famous \" North-west Company,\" which for a time held a lordly sway over the wintry lakes and boundless forests of the Canadas, almost equal to that of the East India Com pany over the voluptuous climes and magnificent realms of the Orient. The company consisted of twenty-three share holders, or partners, but held in its employ about two thousand persons as clerks, guides, interpreters, and \" voyageurs,\" or boatmen. These were distributed at various trading posts, established far and wide on the interior lakes and rivers, at immense distances from each other, and in the heart of trackless countries and savage tribes. Several of the partners resided in Montreal and Quebec, to manage the main concerns of the company. These were called agents, and were personages of great weight and im portance ; the other partners took their stations at the interior posts, where they remained throughout the winter, to super-"], [29, "21 PROBATION IN THE WILDERNESS. intend the intercourse with the various tribes of Indians. They were thence called wintering partners. The goods destined for this wide and wandering traffic were put up at the warehouses of the company in Montreal, and con veyed in batteaux, or boats, and canoes, up the river Attawa, or Ottawa, which falls into the St. Lawrence near Montreal, and by other rivers and portages, to lake Nipising, lake Huron, lake Superior, and thence, by several chains of great and small lakes, to lake Winipeg, lake Athabasca, and the great Slave lake. This singular and beautiful system of internal seas, which renders an immense region of wilderness so accessible to the frail bark of the Indian or the trader, was studded by the remote posts of the company, where they carried on their traffic with the surrounding tribes. The company, as we have shown, was at first a spontaneous association of merchants ; but, after it had been regularly or ganized, admission into it became extremely difficult. A can didate had to enter, as it were, \" before the mast,\" to undergo a long probation, and to rise slowly by his merits and services. He began, at an early age, as a clerk, and served an appren ticeship of seven years, for which he received one hundred pounds sterling, was maintained at the expense of the compa ny, and furnished with suitable clothing and equipments. His probation was generally passed at the interior trading posts ; removed for years from civilized society, leading a life almost as wild and precarious as the savages around him ; exposed to the severities of a northern winter, often suffering from a scarcity of food, and sometimes destitute for a long time of both bread and salt. When his apprenticeship had expired, he received a salary according to his deserts, varying from eighty to one hundred and sixty pounds sterling, and was now eligible to the great object of his ambition, a partnership in"], [30, "22 HYPERBOREAN NABOBS. the company ; though years might yet elapse before he attained to that enviable station. Most of tbe clerks were young men of good families, from the Highlands of Scotland, characterised by the perseverance, thrift, and fidelity of their country, and fitted by their native hardihood to encounter the rigorous climate of the north, and to endure the trials and privations of their lot ; though it must not be concealed that the constitutions of many of them be came impaired by the hardships of the wilderness, and their stomachs injured by occasional famishing, and especially by the want of bread and salt. Now and then, at an interval of years, they were permitted to come down on a visit to the establishment at Montreal, to recruit their health and to have a taste of civilized life ; and these were brilliant spots in their existence. As to the principal partners, or agents, who resided in Montreal and Quebec, they formed a kind of commercial aris tocracy, living in lordly and hospitable style. Their early associations, when clerks at the remote trading posts, and the pleasures, dangers, adventures, and mishaps, which they had shared together in their wild wood life, had linked them heartily to each other, so that they formed a convivial fraternity. Few travellers that have visited Canada some thirty years since, in the days of the M'Tavishes, the M'Gillivrays, the M'Kenzies, the Frobishers, and the other magnates of the north-west, when the company was in all its glory, but must remember the round of feasting and revelry kept up among these hyper borean nabobs. Sometimes one or two partners, recently from the interior posts, would make their appearance in New York, in the course of a tour of pleasure and curiosity. On these occasions there was always a degree of magnificence of the purse about"], [31, "FEUDAL NOTIONS IN THE FORESTS. 23 them, and a peculiar propensity to expenditure at the gold smiths and jewellers, for rings, chains, brooches, necklaces, jewelled watches, and other rich trinkets, partly for their own wear, partly for presents to their female acquaintances ; a gorgeous prodigality, such as was often to be noticed in former times in southern planters and West India Creoles, when flush with the profits of their plantations. To behold the North-west Company in all its state and grandeur, however, it was necessary to witness an annual gathering at tbe great interior place of conference established at Fort William, near what is called the Grand Portage, on lake Superior. Here two or three of the leading partners from Montreal proceeded once a year, to meet the partners from the various trading posts of the wilderness, to discuss the affairs of the company during the preceding year, and to arrange plans for the future. On these occasions might be seen the change since the unceremonious times of the old French traders ; now the aris tocratical character of the Briton shone forth magnificently, or rather the feudal spirit of the Highlander. Every partner who had charge of an interior post, and a score of retainers at his command, felt like the chieftain of a Highland clan, and was almost as important in the eyes of his dependants as of himself. To him a visit to the grand conference at Fort William was a most important event ; and he repaired there as to a meeting of parliament. The partners from Montreal, however, were the lords of the ascendant ; coming from the midst of luxurious and osten tatious life, they quite eclipsed their compeers from the woods, whose forms and faces had been battered and hardened by hard living and hard service, and whose garments and equip ments were all the worse for wear. Indeed, the partners from"], [32, "24 WASSAILING IN THE WILDERNESS. below considered the whole dignity of the company as repre sented in their persons, and conducted themselves in suitable style. They ascended the rivers in great state, like sovereigns making a progress : or rather like Highland chieftains navi gating their subject lakes. They were wrapped in rich furs, their huge canoes freighted with every convenience and luxury, and manned by Canadian voyageurs, as obedient as Highland clansmen. They carried up with them cooks and bakers, together with delicacies of every kind, and abundance of choice wines for the banquets which attended this great convocation. Happy were they, too, if they could meet with some distin guished stranger, above all, some titled member of the British nobility, to accompany them on this stately occasion, and grace their high solemnities. Fort William, the scene of this important annual meeting, was a considerable village on the banks of lake Superior. Here, in an immense wooden building, was the great council hall, as also the banqueting chamber, decorated with Indian arms and accoutrements, and the trophies of the fur trade. The house swarmed at this time with traders and voyageurs, some from Montreal, bound to the interior posts ; some from the interior posts, bound to Montreal. The councils were held in great state, for every member felt as if sitting in parliament, and every retainer and dependant looked up to the assemblage with awe, as to the house of lords. There was a vast deal of solemn deliberation, and hard Scottish reasoning, with an occasional swell of pompous declamation. These grave and weighty councils were alternated by huge feasts and revels, like some of the old feasts described in High land castles. The tables in the great banqueting room groaned under the weight of game of all kinds ; of venison from the woods, and fish from the lakes, with hunters' delicacies, such"], [33, "25 THE GLORIES OF FORT WILLIAM. as buffalo's tongues, and beavers' tails ; and various luxuries from Montreal, all served up by experienced cooks brought for the purpose. There was no stint of generous wine, for it was a hard-drinking period, a time of loyal toasts, and bacchanalian songs, and brimming bumpers. While the chiefs thus revelled in hall, and made the rasters resound with bursts of loyalty and old Scottish songs, chaunted in voices cracked and sharpened by the northern blast, their merriment was echoed and prolonged by a mongrel legion of retainers, Canadian voyageurs, half breeds, Indian hunters, and vagabond hangers-on, who feasted sumptuously without on the crumbs that fell from their table, and made the welkin ring with old French ditties, mingled with Indian yelps and yellings. Such was the North-west Company in its powerful and prosperous days, when it held a kind of feudal sway over a vast domain of lake and forest. We are dwelling too long, perhaps, upon these individual pictures, endeared to us by the associations of early life, when, as yet a stripling youth, we have sat at the hospitable boards of the \" mighty North-westers,\" then lords of the ascendant at Montreal, and gazed with wondering and inexperienced eye at their baronial wassailing, and lis tened with astonished ear to their tales of hardships and adventures. It is one object of our task, however, to present scenes of the rough life of the wilderness, and we are tempted to fix these few memorials of a transient state of things fast passing into oblivion ; \u2014 for the feudal state of Fort William is at an end ; its council chamber is silent and deserted ; its banquet hall no longer echoes to the burst of loyalty, or the \" auld world\" ditty ; the lords of the lakes and forests have passed away ; and the hospitable magnates of Montreal \u2014 where are they ! 3"], [34, "26 RISE OF THE MACKINAW COMPANY.

The success of the North-west Company stimulated further enterprise in this opening and apparently boundless field of profit. The traffic of that company lay principally in the high northern latitudes, while there were immense regions to the south and west, known to abound with valuable peltries ; but which, as yet, had been but little explored by the fur trader A new association of British merchants was therefore formed, to prosecute the trade in this direction. The chief factory was established at the old emporium of Michilimackinac, from which place the association took its name, and was commonly called the Mackinaw Company. While the North-westers continued to push their enterprises into the hyperborean regions from their strong hold at Fort William, and to hold almost sovereign sway over the tribes of the upper lakes and rivers, the Mackinaw Company sent forth their light perogues and barks, by Green bay, Fox river, and the Wisconsin, to that great artery of the west, the Mississippi ; and down that stream to all its tributary rivers. In this way they hoped soon to monopolize the trade with all the tribes on"], [35, "JOHN JACOB ASTOR. 27 the southern and western waters, and of those vast tracts com prised in ancient Louisiana. The government of the United States began to view with a wary eye the growing influence thus acquired by combinations of foreigners, over the aboriginal tribes inhabiting its territories, and endeavored to counteract it. For this purpose, as early as 1796, the government sent out agents to establish rival trading houses on the frontier, so as to supply the wants of the Indians ; to link their interests and feelings with those of the people of the United States, and to divert this important branch of trade into national channels. The expedient, however, was unsuccessful, as most commer cial expedients are prone to be, where the dull patronage of government is counted upon to outvie the keen activity of pri vate enterprise. What government failed to effect, however, with all its patronage and all its agents, was at length brought about by the enterprise and perseverance of a single merchant, one of its adopted citizens ; and this brings us to speak of the individual whose enterprise is the especial subject of the fol lowing pages ; a man whose name and character are worthy of being enrolled in the history of commerce, as illustrating its noblest aims and soundest maxims. A few brief anecdotes of his early life, and of the circumstances which first determined him to the branch of commerce of which we are treating, can not but be interesting. John Jacob Astor, the individual in question, was born in the honest little German village of Waldorf, near Heidelberg, on the banks of the Rhine. He was brought up in the simplicity of rural life, but, while yet a mere stripling, left his home, and launched himself amid the busy scenes of London, having had, from his very boyhood, a singular presentiment that he would ultimately arrive at great fortune"], [36, "28 HIS FIRST ARRIVAL IN AMERICA. At the close of the American Revolution he was still in Lon don, and scarce on the threshold of active life. An elder brother had been for some few years resident in the United States, and Mr. Astor determined to follow him, and to seek his fortunes in the rising country. Investing a small sum which he had amassed since leaving his native village, in merchandise suited to the American market, he embarked, in the month of November, 1783, in a ship bound to Baltimore, and arrived in Hampton Roads in the month of January. The winter was extremely severe, and the ship, with many others, was detained by the ice in and about Chesapeake bay for nearly three months. During this period, the passengers of the various ships used occasionally to go on shore, and mingle sociably together. In this way Mr. Astor became acquainted with a countryman of his, a furrier by trade. Having had a previous impression that this might be a lucrative trade in the new world, he made many inquiries of his new acquaintance on the subject, who cheer fully gave him all the information in his power as to the quality and value of different furs, and the mode of carrying on the traffic. He subsequently accompanied him to New York, and, by his advice, Mr. Astor was induced to invest the proceeds of his merchandise in furs. With these he sailed from New York to London in 1784, disposed of them advantageously, made himself further acquainted with the course of the trade, and returned the same year to New York, with a view to set tle in the United States. He now devoted himself to the branch of commerce with which he had thus casually been made acquainted. He began his career, of course, on the narrowest scale ; but he brought to the task a persevering industry, rigid economy, and strict integrity. To these were added an aspiring spirit that always looked upward ; a genius bold, fertile, and expansive ; a saga-"], [37, "29 DEALINGS IN CANADA. city quick to grasp and convert every circumstance to its advan tage, and a singular and never wavering confidence of signal success.* As yet, trade in peltries was not organized in the United States, and could not be said to form a regular line of business. Furs and skins were casually collected by the country traders in their dealings with the Indians or the white hunters, but the main supply was derived from Canada. As Mr. Astor's means increased, he made annual visits to Montreal, where he pur chased furs from the houses at that place engaged in the trade. These he shipped from Canada to London, no direct trade be ing allowed from that colony to any but the mother country. In 1794 or '5, a treaty with Great Britain removed the re strictions imposed upon the trade with the colonies, and opened a direct commercial intercourse between Canada and the United States. Mr. Astor was in London at the time, and immediately made a contract with the agents of the North-west Company for furs. He was now enabled to import them from Montreal into the United States for the home supply, and to be shipped thence to different parts of Europe, as well as to China, which has ever been the best market for the richest and finest kinds of peltry. The treaty in question provided, likewise, that the military posts occupied by the British within the territorial limits of the United States, should be surrendered. Accordingly, Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michilimackinac, and other posts on the Amer- * An instance of this buoyant confidence, which no doubt aided to pro duce the success it anticipated, we have from the lips of Mr. A. himself.

An opening was thus made for the American merchant to a trade, on the confines of Canada, and within the territories of the United States. After an interval of some years, about 1807, Mr. Astor embarked in this trade on his own account. His capital and resources had by this time greatly augmented, and he had risen from small beginnings to take his place among the first merchants and financiers of the country. His genius had ever been in ad vance of his circumstances, prompting him to new and wide fields of enterprise beyond the scope of ordinary merchants. With all his enterprise and resources, however, he soon found the power and influence of the Michilimackinac (or Mackinaw) Company too great for him, having engrossed most of the trade within the American borders. A plan had to be devised to enable him to enter into success ful competition. He was aware of the wish of the American government, already stated, that the fur trade within its boun daries should be in the hands of American citizens, and of the ineffectual measures it had taken to accomplish that object. He now offered, if aided and protected by government, to turn the whole of that trade into American channels. He was in vited to unfold his plans to government, and they were warmly approved, though the executive could give no direct aid. Thus countenanced, however, he obtained in 1809, a charter from the legislature of the state of New York, incorporating a company under the name of \" The American Fur Company,\" with a capital of one million of dollars, with the privilege of increasing it to two millions. The capital was furnished by himself \u2014 he, in fact, constituted the company ; for, though he had a board of directors, they were merely nominal ; the whole business was conducted on his plans, and with his re sources, but he preferred to do so under the imposing and for-"], [39, "31 SOUTH-WEST COMPANY. midable aspect of a corporation, rather than in his individual name, and his policy was sagacious and effective. As the Mackinaw Company still continued its rivalry, and as the fur trade would not advantageously admit of competi tion, he made a new arrangement in 1811, by which, in con junction with certain partners of the North-west Company, and other persons engaged in the fur trade, he bought out the Mack inaw Company, and merged that and the American Fur Com pany into a new association, to be called \" The South-west Company.\" This he likewise did with the privity and appro bation of the American government. By this arrangement Mr. Astor became proprietor of one half of the Indian establishments and goods which the Mackinaw Company had within the territory of the Indian country in the United States, and it was understood that the whole was to be surrendered into his hands at the expiration of five years, on condition that the American company would not trade within the British dominions. Unluckily, the war which broke out in 1812 between Great Britain and the United States suspended the association ; and, after the war, it was entirely dissolved ; congress having passed a law prohibiting British fur traders from prosecuting their en terprises within the territories of the United States."], [40, "32 FUR TRADE IN THE PACIFIC.

While the various companies we have noticed were pushing their enterprises far and wide in the wilds of Canada, and along the course of the great western waters, other adven turers, intent on the same objects, were traversing the watery wastes of the Pacific and skirting the north-west coast of America. The last voyage of that renowned but unfortunate discoverer, Captain Cook, had made known the vast quantities of tbe sea otter to be found along that coast, and the immense prices to be obtained for its fur in China. It was as if a new gold coast bad been discovered. Individuals from various countries dashed into this lucrative traffic, so that in the year 1792, there were twenty-one vessels under different flags, plying along the coast and trading with the natives. The greater part of them were American, and owned by Boston merchants. They generally remained on the coast, and about the adjacent seas for two years, carrying on as wandering and adventurous a commerce on the water as did the traders and trappers on land. Their trade extended along tbe whole coast"], [41, "RUSSIAN ENTERPRISES. 33 from California to the high northern latitudes. They would run in near shore, anchor, and wait for the natives to come off in their canoes with peltries. The trade exhausted al one place, they would up anchor and off to another. In this way they would consume the summer, and when autumn came on, would run down to the Sandwich islands and winter in some friendly and plentiful harbor. In the following year they would resume their summer trade, commencing at California and proceeding north ; and, having in the course of the two seasons, collected a sufficient cargo of peltries, would make the best of their way to China. Here they would sell their furs, take in teas, nankeens, and other merchandize, and return to Boston, after an absence of two or three years. The people, however, who entered most extensively and effectively in the fur trade of the Pacific, were the Russians. Instead of making casual voyages, in transient ships, they established regular trading houses in the high latitudes, along the north-west coast of America, and upon the chain of the Aleutian islands between Kamtschatka and the promontory of Alaska. To promote and protect these enterprises, a company was incorporated by the Russian government with exclusive privi leges, and a capital of two hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling ; and the sovereignty of that part of the American continent, along the coast of which the posts had been estab lished, was claimed by the Russian crown, on the plea that the land had been discovered and occupied by its subjects. As China was the grand mart for the furs collected in these quarters, the Russians had the advantage over their competitors in the trade. The latter had to take their peltries to Canton, which, however, was a mere receiving mart, from whence they had to be distributed over the interior of the empire and sent"], [42, "34 DISCOVERY OF THE COLUMBIA. to the northern parts, where there was the chief consumption The Russians, on the contrary, carried their furs, by a shortei voyage, directly to the northern parts of the Chinese empire , thus being able to afford them in the market without the addi tional cost of internal transportation. We now come to the immediate field of operation of the great enterprise we have undertaken to illustrate. Among the American ships which traded along the north west coast in 1792, was the Columbia, Captain Gray, of Boston. In the course of her voyage she discovered the mouth of a large river in lat. 46\u00b0 19' north. Entering it with some difficulty, on account of sand bars and breakers, she came to anchor in a spacious bay. A boat was well manned, and sent on shore to a village on the beach, but all the inhab itants fled excepting the aged and infirm. The kind manner in which these were treated, and the presents given to them, gradually lured back the others, and a friendly intercourse took place. They had never seen a ship or a white man. When they had first descried the Columbia, they had supposed it a floating island ; then some monster of the deep ; but when they saw the boat putting for shore with human beings on board, they considered them cannibals sent by the great Spirit to ravage the country and devour tbe inhabitants. Captain Gray did not ascend the river farther than the bay in question, which continues to bear his name. After putting to sea, he fell in with the celebrated discoverer, Vancouver, and informed him of his discovery, furnishing him with a chart which he had made of the river. Vancouver visited the river, and his lieutenant, Broughton, explored it by the aid of Captain Gray's chart ; ascending it upwards of one hundred miles, until within view of a snowy mountain, to which he gave the name of Mount Hood, which it still retains."], [43, "CARVER'S PROJECT. 35 The existence of this river, however, was known long be fore the visits of Gray and Vancouver, but the information concerning it was vague and indefinite, being gathered from the reports of Indians. It was spoken of by travellers as the Oregon, and as the great river of the west. A Spanish ship is said to have been wrecked at its mouth, several of the crew of which lived for some time among the natives. The Co lumbia, however, is believed to be the first ship that made a regular discovery and anchored within its waters, and it has since generally borne the name of that vessel. As early as 1763, shortly after the acquisition of the Canadas by Great Britain, Captain Jonathan Carver, who had been in the British provincial army, projected a journey across the continent between the forty-third and forty-sixth degrees of northern latitude, to the shores of the Pacific ocean. His objects were to ascertain the breadth of the continent at its broadest part, and to determine on some place on the shores of the Pacific, where government might establish a post to facilitate the discovery of a north-west passage, or a communication between Hudson's bay and the Pacific ocean. This place he presumed would be somewhere about the straits of Annian, at which point he supposed the Oregon disem bogued itself. It was his opinion, also, that a settlement on this extremity of America would disclose new sources of trade, promote many useful discoveries, and open a more direct com munication with China and the English settlements in the East Indies, than that by the cape of Good Hope or the straits of Magellan.* This enterprising and intrepid traveller was twice baffled in individual efforts to accomplish this great journey. In 1774, he was joined in the scheme by Richard * Carver's Travels, Introd. p. iii Philad. 1796."], [44, "Mackenzie's expedition. 36 Whitworth, a member of parliament, and a man of wealth. Their enterprise was projected on a broad and bold plan. They were to take with them fifty or sixty men, artificers and mariners. With these they were to make their way up one of the branches of the Missouri, explore the mountains for the source of the Oregon, or river of the west, and sail down that river to its supposed exit near the straits of Annian. Here they were to erect a fort, and build the vessels necessary to carry their discoveries by sea into effect. Their plan had the sanction of the British government, and grants and other requisites were nearly completed, when the breaking out of the American revolution once more defeated the undertaking.* The expedition of Sir Alexander Mackenzie in 1793, across the continent to the Pacific ocean, which he reached in lat. 52\u00b0 20' 48\", again suggested the possibility of linking to gether the trade of both sides of the continent. In lat. 52\u00b0 30' he had descended a river for some distance which flowed towards the south, and was called by the natives Tacoutche Tesse, and which he erroneously supposed to be the Co lumbia. It was afterwards ascertained that it emptied itself in lat. 49', whereas the mouth of the Columbia is about three degrees further south. When Mackenzie some years subsequently published an account of his expeditions, he suggested the policy of opening an intercourse between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and forming regular establishments through the interior and at both extremes, as well as along the coasts and islands. By this means, he observed, the entire command of the fur trade of North America might be obtained from latitude 48' north, to the pole, excepting that portion held by the Russians, for as * Carver's Travels, p. 360.

A scheme of this kind, however, was too vast and hazardous for individual enterprise ; it could only be undertaken by a company under the sanction and protection of a government ; and as there might be a clashing of claims between the Hud son's Bay and North-west Company, the one holding by right of charter, the other by right of possession, he proposed that the two companies should coalesce in this great undertaking. The long cherished jealousies of these two companies, how ever, were too deep and strong to allow them to listen to such council. In the mean time the attention of the American government was attracted to the subject, and the memorable expedition under Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, fitted out. These gentlemen, in 1804, accomplished the enterprise which had been pro jected by Carver and Whitworth, in 1774. They ascended the Missouri, passed through the stupendous gates of the Rocky mountains, hitherto unknown to white man ; discovered and explored the upper waters of the Columbia, and followed that river down to its mouth, where their countryman, Gray, had anchored about twelve years previously. Here they passed the winter, and returned across the mountains in the following spring. The reports published by them of their expedition, demonstrated the practicability of establishing a line of communication across the continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean. It was then that the idea presented itself to the mind of Mr. Astor, of grasping with his individual hand, this great enterprise, which for years had been dubiously yet desirously contemplated by powerful associations and maternal govern- 4"], [46, "38 SCHEME OF MR. ASTOR. ments. For some time he revolved the idea in his mind, gradually extending and maturing his plans as his means of executing them augmented. The main feature of his scheme was to establish a line of trading posts along the Missouri and the Columbia, to the mouth of the latter, where was to be founded the chief trading house or mart. Inferior posts would be established in the interior, and on all the tributary streams of the Columbia, to trade with the Indians ; these posts would draw their supplies from the main establishment, and bring to it the peltries they collected. Coasting craft would be built and fitted out, also, at the mouth of the Co lumbia, to trade, at favorable seasons, all along the north-west coast, and return, with the proceeds of their voyages, to this place of deposite. Thus all the Indian trade, both of the inte rior and the coast, would converge to this point, and thence derive its sustenance. A ship was to be sent annually from New York to this main establishment with re-enforcements and supplies, and with mer chandize suited to the trade. It would take on board the furs collected during the preceding year, carry them to Canton, in vest the proceeds in the rich merchandize of China, and return thus freighted to New York. As, in extending the American trade along the coast to the northward, it might be brought into the vicinity of the Russian Fur Company, and produce a hostile rivalry, it was part of the plan of Mr. Astor to conciliate the good will of that company by the most amicable and beneficial arrangements. The Rus sian establishment was chiefly dependant for its supplies upon transient trading vessels from the United States. These ves sels, however, were often of more harm than advantage. Be ing owned by private adventurers, or casual voyagers, who cared only for present profit, and had no interest in the permanent"], [47, "SCHEME OF MR. ASTOR. 39 prosperity of the trade, they were reckless in their dealings with the natives, and made no scruple of supplying them with fire-arms. In this way several fierce tribes in the vicinity of the Russian posts, or within the range of their trading excur sions, were furnished with deadly means of warfare, and ren dered troublesome and dangerous neighbors. The Russian government had made representations to that of the United States of these malpractices on the part of its citizens, and urged to have this traffic in arms prohibited ; .but, as it did not infringe any municipal law, our government could not interfere. Yet still it regarded, with solicitude, a traffic which, if persisted in, might give offence to Russia, at that time almost the only power friendly to us. In this dilemma the government had applied to Mr. Astor, as one conversant in this branch of trade, for information that might point out a way to remedy the evil. This circumstance had suggested to him the idea of sup plying the Russian establishment regularly by means of the annual ship that should visit the settlement at the mouth of the Columbia (or Oregon) ; by this means the casual trading ves sels would be excluded from those parts of the coast where their malpractices were so injurious to the Russians. Such is a brief outline of tbe enterprise projected by Mr. Astor, but which continually expanded in his mind. Indeed it is due to him to say that he was not actuated by mere mo tives of individual profit. He was already wealthy beyond the ordinary desires of man, but he now aspired to that honorable fame which is awarded to men of similar scope of mind, who by their great commercial enterprises have enriched nations, peopled wildernesses, and extended the bounds of empire. He considered his projected establishment at the mouth of the Co lumbia as the emporium to an immense commerce ; as a colony that would form the germ of a wide civilization ; that would, in"], [48, "40 LETTER OF MR. JEFFERSON. fact, carry the American population across the Rocky moun tains and spread it along the shores of the Pacific, as it already animated the shores of the Atlantic. As Mr. Astor by the magnitude of his commercial and finan cial relations, and the vigor and scope of his self-taught mind, had elevated himself into the consideration of government and the communion and correspondence with leading statesmen, he, at an early period, communicated his schemes to President Jefferson, soliciting the countenance of government. How highly they were esteemed by that eminent man, we may judge by the following passage, written by him some time after wards to Mr. Astor. \" I remember well having invited your proposition on this subject,* and encouraged it with the assurance of every facility and protection which the government could properly afford. I considered, as a great public acquisition, the commencement of a settlement on that point of the western coast of America, and looked forward with gratification to the time when its de scendants should have spread themselves through the whole length of that coast, covering it with free and independent Americans, unconnected with us but by the ties of blood and interest, and enjoying like us the rights of self-government.\" The cabinet joined with Mr. Jefferson in warm approbation of the plan, and held out assurance of every protection that could, consistently with general policy, be afforded. Mr. Astor now prepared to carry his scheme into prompt execution. He had some competition, however, to apprehend * On this point Mr. Jefferson's memory was in error.

The North-west Company, acting feebly and partially upon the suggestions of its former agent, Sir Alex ander Mackenzie, had pushed one or two advanced trading posts across the Rocky mountains, into a tract of country visited by that enterprising traveller, and since named New Caledonia. This tract lay about two degrees north of the Columbia, and inter vened between the territories of the United States and those of Russia. Its length was about five hundred and fifty miles, and its breadth, from the mountains to the Pacific, from three hun dred to three hundred and fifty geographical miles. Should the North-west Company persist in extending their trade in that quarter, their competition might be of serious det riment to the plans of Mr. Astor. It is true they would con tend with him to a vast disadvantage, from the checks and re strictions to which they were subjected. They were straitened on one side by the rivalry of the Hudson's Bay Company ; then they had no good post on the Pacific where they could receive supplies by sea for their establishments beyond the mountains ; nor, if they had one, could they ship their furs thence to China, that great mart for peltries ; the Chinese trade being comprised in the monopoly of the East India Company. Their posts be yond the mountains had to be supplied in yearly expeditions, like caravans, from Montreal, and the furs conveyed back in the same way, by long, precarious, and expensive routes, across the continent. Mr. Astor, on the contrary, would be able to supply his proposed establishment at the mouth of the Columbia by sea, and to ship the furs collected there directly to China, so as to undersell the North-west Company in the great Chi nese market. Still, the competition of two rival companies west of the Rocky mountains could not but prove detrimental to both, and fraught with those evils, both to the trade and to the Indians, 4*"], [50, "42 NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE N. W. COMPANY. that had attended similar rivalries in the Canadas. To prevent any contest of the kind, therefore, he made known his plan to the agents of the North-west Company, and proposed to in terest them, to the extent of one third, in the trade thus to be opened. Some correspondence and negotiation ensued. The company were aware of the advantages which would be pos sessed by Mr. Astor should he be able to carry his scheme into effect ; but they anticipated a monopoly of the trade be yond the mountains by their establishments in New Caledonia, and were loth to share it with an individual who had already proved a formidable competitor in the Atlantic trade. They hoped, too, by a timely move, to secure the mouth of the Co lumbia before Mr. Astor would be able to put his plans into operation ; and, that key to the internal trade once in their pos session, the whole country would be at their command. After some negotiation and delay, therefore, they declined the propo sition that had been made to them, but subsequently dispatched a party for the mouth of the Columbia, to establish a post there before any expedition sent out by Mr. Astor might arrive. In the mean time, Mr. Astor finding his overtures rejected, pro ceeded fearlessly to execute his enterprise in face of the whole power of the North-west Company. His main establishment once planted at the mouth of the Columbia, he looked with confi dence to ultimate success. Being able to re-enforce and supply it amply by sea, he would push his interior posts in every direc tion up the rivers and along the coast ; supplying the natives at a lower rate, and thus gradually obliging the North-west Company to give up the competition, relinquish New Caledonia, and retire to the other side of the mountains. He would then have posses sion of the trade, not merely of the Columbia and its tributa ries, but of the regions farther north, quite to the Russian posses sions. Such was a part of his brilliant and comprehensive plan."], [51, "43 PACIFIC FUR COMPANY. He now proceeded, with all diligence, to procure proper agents and coadjutors, habituated to the Indian trade and to the life of the wilderness. Among the clerks of the North-west Company were several of great capacity and experience, who had served out their probationary terms, but who, either through lack of interest and influence, or a want of vacancies, had not been promoted. They were consequently much dissatisfied, and ready for any employment in which their talents and acquire ments might be turned to better account. Mr. Astor made his overtures to several of these persons, and three of them entered into his views. One of these, Mr. Alexander M'Kay, had accompanied Sir Alexander Mackenzie in both of his expeditions to the north-west coast of America in 1789 and 1793. The other two were Duncan M'Dougal and Donald M'Kenzie. To these was subsequently added Mr. Wilson Price Hunt, of New Jersey. As this gentleman was a native born citizen of the United States, and a person of great probity and worth, he was selected by Mr. Astor to be his chief agent, and to represent him in the contemplated estabbshment. On the 23d of June, 1810, articles of agreement were en tered into between Mr. Astor and those four gentlemen, acting for themselves and for the several persons who had already agreed to become, or should thereafter become, associated under the firm of \" The Pacific Fur Company.\" According to these articles, Mr. Astor was to be at the head of the company, and to manage its affairs in New York. He was to furnish vessels, goods, provisions, arms, ammunition, and all other requisites for the enterprise at first cost and charges, provided that they did not, at any time, involve an advance of more than four hundred thousand dollars. The stock of the company was to be divided into a hundred equal shares, with the profits accruing thereon. Fifty shares"], [52, "44 ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION. were to be at the disposition of Mr. Astor, and the other fifty to be divided among the partners and their associates. Mr. Astor was to have the privilege of introducing other per sons into the connexion, as partners, two of whom, at least, should be conversant with the Indian trade, and none of them entitled to more than three shares. A general meeting of the company was to be held annually at Columbia river, for the investigation and regulation of its affairs ; at which absent members might be represented, and might vote by proxy under certain specified conditions. The association, if successful, was to continue for twenty years ; but the parties had full power to abandon and dissolve it within the first five years, should it be found unprofitable. For this term Mr. Astor covenanted to bear all the loss that might be incurred ; after which it was to be borne by all the partners, in proportion to their respective shares. The parties of the second part were to execute faithfully such duties as might be assigned to them by a majority of the company on tbe north-west coast, and to repair to such place or places as the majority might direct. An agent, appointed for the term of five years, was to reside at the principal establishment on the north-west coast, and Wilson Price Hunt was the one chosen for the first term. Should the interests of the concern at any time require his absence, a person was to be appointed, in general meeting, to take his place. Such were the leading conditions of this association ; we shall now proceed to relate the various hardy and eventful expeditions, by sea and land, to which it gave rise."], [53, "TWO EXPEDITIONS SET ON FOOT. 45 CHAPTER IV.

In prosecuting his great scheme of commerce and coloniza tion, two expeditions were devised by Mr. Astor, one by sea, the other by land. The former was to carry out the people, stores, ammunition, and merchandise, requisite for establishing a fortified trading post at the mouth of Columbia river. The latter, conducted by Mr. Himt, was to proceed up the Missouri, and across the Rocky mountains, to the same point ; exploring a line of communication across the continent, and noting the places where interior trading posts might be established. The expedition by sea is the one which comes first under consider ation. A fine ship was provided called the Tonquin, of two hundred and ninety tons burthen, mounting ten guns, with a crew of twenty men. She carried an assortment of merchandise for trading with the natives of the sea board and of the interior, together with the frame of a schooner, to be employed in the coasting trade. Seeds also were provided for the cultivation of the soil, and nothing was neglected for the necessary sup-"], [54, "46 PARTNERS AND CLERKS. ply of the establishment. The command of the ship was intrusted to Jonathan Thorn, of New York, a lieutenant in the United States navy, on leave of absence. He was a man of courage and firmness, who had distinguished himself in our Tripolitan war, and, from being accustomed to naval discipline, was considered by Mr. Astor as well fitted to take charge of an expedition of the kind. Four of the partners were to em bark in the ship, namely, Messrs. M'Kay, M'Dougal, David Stuart, and his nephew, Robert Stuart. Mr. M'Dougal was empowered by Mr. Astor to act as his proxy in the absence of Mr. Hunt, to vote for him and in his name, on any question that might come before any meeting of the persons interested in the voyage. Beside the partners, there were twelve clerks to go out in the ship, several of them natives of Canada, who had some expe rience in Indian trade. They were bound to the service of the company for five years, at the rate of one hundred dollars a year, payable at the expiration of the term, and an annual equip ment of clothing to the amount of forty dollars. In case of ill conduct they were liable to forfeit their wages and be dis missed ; but, should they acquit themselves well, the confident expectation was held out to them of promotion, and partner. ship. Their interests were thus, to some extent, identified with those of the company. Several artisans were likewise to sail in the ship, for the supply of the colony ; but the most peculiar and character istic part of this motley embarkation consisted of thirteen Canadian \" voyageurs,\" who had enlisted for five years. As this class of functionaries will continually recur in the course of the following narrations, and as they form one of those distinct and strongly marked castes or orders of people, spring ing up in this vast continent out of geographical circumstances,"], [55, "47 CANADIAN VOYAGEURS. or the varied pursuits, habitudes, and origins of its population, we shall sketch a few of their characteristics for the informa tion of the reader. The \" voyageurs \" form a kind of confraternity in the Can adas, like the arrieros, or carriers of Spain, and, like them, are employed in long internal expeditions of travel and traffic : with this difference, that the arrieros travel by land, the voy ageurs by water ; the former with mules and horses, the latter with batteaux and canoes. The voyageurs may be said to have sprung up out of the fur trade, having originally been employed by the early French merchants in their trading expeditions through the labyrinth of rivers and lakes of the boundless interior. They were coeval with the coureurs des bois, or rangers of the woods, already noticed, and, like them, in the intervals of their long, arduous, and laborious expeditions, were prone to pass their time in idleness and revelry about the trading posts or settlements ; squandering their hard earnings in heedless conviviality, and rivalling their neighbors, the Indians, in indolent indulgence and an imprudent disregard of the morrow. When Canada passed under British domination, and the old French trading houses were broken up, the voyageurs, like the coureurs des bois, were for a time disheartened and discon solate, and with difficulty could reconcile themselves to the service of the new comers, so different in habits, manners and language from their former employers. By degrees, however, they became accustomed to the change, and at length came to consider the British fur traders, and especially the members of the North-west Company, as the legitimate lords of creation. The dress of these people is generally half civilized, half savage. They wear a capot or surcoat, made of a blanket, a striped cotton shirt, cloth trowsers, or leathern legging, moc-"], [56, "48 LIFE ON THE LAKES. casins of deer skin, and a belt of variegated worsted, from which are suspended the knife, tobacco pouch and other im plements. Their language is of the same piebald character, being a French patois, embroidered with Indian and English words and phrases. The lives of the voyageurs are passed in wild and extensive rovings, in the service of individuals, but more especially of the fur traders. They are generally of French descent, and inherit much of the gayety and lightness of heart of their ancestors, being full of anecdote and song, and ever ready for the dance. They inherit, too, a fund of civility and complaisance ; and, instead of that hardness and grossness which men in laborious life are apt to indulge towards each other, they are mutually obliging and accommodating ; interchanging kind offices, yield ing each other assistance and comfort in every emergency, and using the familiar appellations of \" cousin\" and \" brother,\" when there is in fact no relationship. Their natural good will is probably heightened by a community of adventure and hard ship in their precarious and wandering life. No men are more submissive to their leaders and employers, more capable of enduring hardship, or more good-humored under privations. Never are they so happy as when on long and rough expeditions, toiling up rivers or coasting lakes ; encamping at night on the borders, gossipping round their sires, and bivouacking in the open air. They are dextrous boatmen, vigorous and adroit with the oar and paddle, and will row from morning until night without a murmur. The steersman often sings an old traditionary French song, with some regular burden in which they all join, keeping time with their oars ; if at any time they flag in spirits or relax in exertion, it is but necessary to strike up a song of the kind to put them all in fresh spirits and activity. The Canadian waters are vocal"], [57, "49 CANADIAN BOAT SONGS. with these little French chansons, that have been echoed from mouth to mouth and transmitted from father to son, from the earliest days of the colony ; and it has a pleasing effect, in a still golden summer evening, to see a batteau gliding across the bosom of a lake and dipping its oars to the cadence of these quaint old ditties, or sweeping along, in full chorus on a bright sunny morning, down the transparent current of one of the Canada rivers. But we are talking of things that are fast fading away ! The march of mechanical invention is driving every thing poetical before it. The steamboats, which are fast dispelling the wildness and romance of our lakes and rivers^ and aiding to subdue the world into commonplace, are proving as fatal to the race of the Canadian voyageurs as they have been to that of the boatmen of the Mississippi. Their glory is de parted. They are no longer the lords of our internal seas, and the great navigators of the wilderness. Some of them may still occasionally be seen coasting the lower lakes with their frail barks, and pitching their camps and lighting their fires upon the shores ; but their range is fast contracting to those remote waters and shallow and obstructed rivers unvisited by the steamboat. In the course of years they will gradually disappear ; their songs will die away like the echoes they once awakened, and the Canadian voyageurs will become a forgotten race, or remembered, like their associates, the In dians, among the poetical images of past times, and as themes for local and romantic associations. An instance of the buoyant temperament and the profes sional pride of these people was furnished in the gay and braggart style in which they arrived at New York to join the enterprise. They were determined to regale and astonish the people of the \" States\" with the sight of a Canadian boat and 5"], [58, "50 BOATING AND BOASTING. a Canadian crew. They accordingly fitted up a large but light bark canoe, such as is used in the fur trade ; transported it in a waggon from the banks of the St. Lawrence to the shores of lake Champlain ; traversed the lake in it, from end to end ; hoisted it again in a waggon and wheeled it off to Lansingburgh, and there launched it upon the waters of the Hudson. Down this river they plied their course merrily on a fine summer's day, making its banks resound for the first time with their old French boat songs ; passing by the villages with whoop and halloo, so as to make the honest Dutch farmers mistake them for a crew of savages. In this way they swept, in full song, and with regular flourish of the paddle, round New York, in a still summer evening, to the wonder and admiration of its inhabitants, who had never before witnessed on their waters, a nautical apparition of the kind. Such was the variegated band of adventurers about to em bark in the Tonquin on this arduous and doubtful enterprise. While yet in port and on dry land, in the bustle of preparation and the excitement of novelty, all was sunshine and promise. The Canadians especially, who with their constitutional viva city, have a considerable dash of the gascon, were buoyant and boastful, and great braggarts as to the future ; while all those who had been in the service of the North-west Company, and engaged in the Indian trade, plumed themselves upon their hardihood and their capacity to endure privations. If Mr. Astor ventured to hint at the difficulties they might have to encounter, they treated them with scorn. They were \" north westers;\" men seasoned to hardships, who cared for neither wind nor weather. They could live hard, lie hard, sleep hard, eat dogs ! \u2014 in a word they were ready to do and suffer any thing for the good of the enterprise. With all this pro fession of zeal and devotion, Mr. Astor was not over-confident"], [59, "A SPECK OF WAR ON THE HORIZON. 51 of the stability and firm faith of these mercurial beings. He had received information, also, that an armed brig from Halifax, probably at the instigation of the North-west Company, was hovering on the coast, watching for the Tonquin, with the pur pose of impressing the Canadians on board of her, as British subjects, and thus interrupting the voyage. It was a time of doubt and anxiety, when the relations between the United States and Great Britain were daily assuming a more pre carious aspect, and verging towards that war which shortly ensued. As a precautionary measure, therefore, he required that the voyageurs, as they were about to enter into the service of an American association, and to reside within the limits of the United States, should take the oaths of naturalization, as American citizens. To this they readily agreed, and shortly afterward assured him that they had actually done so. It was not until after they had sailed that he discovered that they had entirely deceived him in the matter. The confidence of Mr. Astor was abused in another quarter. Two of the partners, both of them Scotchmen, and recently in the service of the North-west Company, had misgivings as to an enterprise which might clash with the interests and establishments protected by the British flag. They privately waited upon the British minister, Mr. Jackson, then in New York, laid open to him the whole scheme of Mr. Astor, though intrusted to them in confidence, and dependent, in a great measure, upon secrecy at the outset for its success, and in quired whether they, as British subjects, could lawfully engage in it. The reply satisfied their scruples, while the information they imparted excited the surprise and admiration of Mr. Jack son, that a private individual should have conceived and set on foot at his own risk and expense, so great an enterprise. This step on the part of those gentlemen was not known to"], [60, "52 PARTING ADMONITIONS. Mr. Astor until sometime afterwards, or it might have modified the trust and confidence reposed in them. To guard against any interruption to the voyage by the armed brig, said to be off the harbor, Mr. Astor applied to Commodore Rodgers, at that time commanding at New York, to give the Tonquin safe convoy off the coast. The commodore having received from a high official source assurance of the deep interest which the government took in the enterprise, sent directions to Captain Hull, at that time cruising off the harbor, in the frigate Constitution, to afford the Tonquin the required protection when she should put to sea. Before the day of embarkation, Mr. Astor addressed a letter of instruction to the four partners who were to sail in the ship. In this he enjoined them, in the most earnest manner, to cultivate harmony and unanimity, and recommended that all differences of opinions on points connected with the objects and interests of the voyage should be discussed by the whole, and decided by a majority of votes. He, moreover, gave them especial caution as to their conduct on arriving at their des tined port ; exhorting them to be careful to make a favorable impression upon the wild people among whom their lot and the fortunes of the enterprise would be cast. \" If you find them kind,\" said he, \" as I hope you will, be so to them. If otherwise, act with caution and forbearance, and convince them that you come as friends.\" With the same anxious forethought he wrote a letter of in structions to Captain Thorn, in which he urged the strictest attention to the health of himself and his crew, and to the promotion of good-humor and harmony on board his ship. \" To prevent any misunderstanding,\" added he, \" will requiie your particular good management.\" His letter closed with an injunction of wariness in his intercourse with the natives, a"], [61, "53 PARTING ADMONITIONS. subject on which Mr. Astor was justly sensible he could not be too earnest. \" I must recommend you,\" said he, \" to be particularly careful on the coast, and not to rely too much on the friendly disposition of the natives. All accidents which have as yet happened there arose from too much confidence in the Indians.\" The reader will bear these instructions in mind, as events will prove their wisdom and importance, and the disasters which ensued in consequence of the neglect of them. 5"], [62, "54 SAILING OF THE TONQUIN.

On the eighth of September, 1810, the Tonquin put to sea, where she was soon joined by the frigate Constitution. The wind was fresh and fair from the south-west, and the ship was soon out of sight of land and free from the apprehended dan ger of interruption. The frigate, therefore, gave her \" God speed,\" and left her to her course. The harmony so earnestly enjoined by Mr. Astor on this het erogeneous crew, and which had been so confidently promised in the buoyant moments of preparation, was doomed to meet with a check at the very outset. Captain Thorn was an honest, straight-forward, but somewhat dry and dictatorial commander, who, having been nurtured in the system and discipline of a ship of war, and in a sacred opinion of the supremacy of the quarterdeck, was disposed to be absolute lord and master on board of his ship. He appears, moreover, to have had no great opinion, from the first, of the persons embarked with him. He had stood by with surly con-"], [63, "NAUTICAL NOTIONS. 55 tempt while they vaunted so bravely to Mr. Astor of all they could do and all they could undergo ; how they could face all weathers, put up with all kinds of fare, and even eat dogs with a rebsh, when no better food was to be had. He had set them down as a set of land lubbers and braggadocios, and was dis posed to treat them accordingly. Mr. Astor was, in his eyes, his only real employer, being the father of the enterprise, who furnished all funds and bore all losses. The others were mere agents and subordinates, who lived at his expense. He evi dently had but a narrow idea of the scope and nature of the enterprise, limiting his views merely to his part of it ; every thing beyond the concerns of his ship was out of his sphere ; and any thing that interfered with the routine of his nautical duties put him in a passion. The partners, on the other hand, had been brought up in the service of the North-west Company, and in a profound idea of the importance, dignity, and authority of a partner. They already began to consider themselves on a par with the M'Tav ishes, the M'Gillivrays, the Frobishers, and the other mag nates of the north-west, whom they had been accustomed to look up to as the great ones of the earth ; and they were a little disposed, perhaps, to wear their suddenly-acquired honors with some air of pretension. Mr. Astor, too, had put them on their mettle with respect to the captain, describing him as a gun powder fellow who would command his ship in fine style, and, if there was any fighting to do, would \" blow all out of the water.\" Thus prepared to regard each other with no very cordial eye, it is not to be wondered at that the parties soon came into collision. On the very first night Captain Thorn began his man-of-war discipline by ordering the lights in the cabin to be extinguished at eight o'clock. The pride of the partners was immediately in arms. This"], [64, "56 LANDSMEN AT SEA. was an invasion of their rights and dignities not to be borne. They were on board of their own ship, and entitled to consult their ease and enjoyment. M'Dougal was the champion of their cause. He was an active, irritable, fuming, vainglorious little man, and elevated in his own opinion, by being the proxy of Mr. Astor. A violent altercation ensued, in the course of which Thorn threatened to put the partners in irons should they prove refractoiy ; upon which M'Dougal seized a pistol and swore to be the death of tbe captain should he ever offer such an indignity. It was some time before the irritated parties could be pacified by the more temperate by-standers. Such was the captain's outset with the partners. Nor did the clerks stand much higher in his good graces; indeed, he seems to have regarded all the landsmen on board his ship as a kind of live lumber, continually in the way. The poor voy ageurs, too, continually irritated his spleen by their \" lubberly\" and unseemly habits, so abhorrent to one accustomed to the cleanliness of a man-of-war. These poor fresh water sailors, so vainglorious on shore, and almost amphibious when on lakes and rivers, lost all heart and stomach the moment they were at sea. For days they suffered the doleful rigors and retchings of seasickness, lurking below in their berths in squalid state, or emerging now and then like spectres from the hatchways, in capotes and blankets, with dirty nightcaps, grizzly beard, lan tern visage and unhappy eye, shivering about the deck, and ever and anon crawling to the sides of the vessel, and offering up their tributes to the windward, to the infinite annoyance of the captain. His letters to Mr. Astor, wherein he pours forth the bitter ness of his soul, and his seamanlike impatience of what he considers the \" lubberly\" character and conduct of those around him; are before us, and are amusingly characteristic.

As to the clerks, he pronounces them mere pretenders, not one of whom had ever been among Indians, nor farther to the north-west than Montreal, nor of higher rank than barkeeper of a tavern or marker of a billiard table, excepting one, who had been a schoolmaster, and whom he emphatically sets down for \" as foolish a pedant as ever lived.\" Then as to the artisans and laborers who had been brought from Canada and shipped at such expense, the three most respectable, according to the captain's account, were culprits, who had fled from Canada on account of their misdeeds; the rest had figured in Montreal as draymen, barbers, waiters, and carriole drivers, and were the most helpless, worthless beings, \" that ever broke sea biscuit.\" It may easily be imagined what a series of misunderstand ings and cross purposes would be likely to take place between such a crew and such a commander. The captain, in his zeal for the health and cleanliness of his ship, would make sweep ing visitations to the \" lubber nests \" of the unlucky \" voyageurs\" and their companions in misery, ferret them out of their berths, make them air and wash themselves and their accoutrements, and oblige them to stir about briskly and take exercise. Nor did his disgust and vexation cease when all hands had recovered from seasickness, and become accustomed to the ship, for now broke forth an alarming keenness of appetite that threatened havoc to the provisions. What especially irritated the captain was the daintiness of some of his cabin passengers. They were loud in their complaints of the ship's fare, though their table was served with fresh pork, hams, tongues, smoked beef, and puddings. \" When thwarted in their cravings for"], [66, "58 A VETERAN FROM LABRADOR. delicacies,\" said he, \" they would exclaim that it was d \u2014 d hard they could not live as they pleased upon their own property, being on board of their own ship, freighted with their own mer chandise. And these,\" added he, \" are the fine fellows who made such boast that they could ' eat dogs.' \" In his indignation at what he termed their effeminacy, he would swear that he would never take them to sea again \" without having Fly-market on the forecastle, Covent-gar den on the poop, and a cool spring from Canada in the maintop.\" As they proceeded on their voyage and got into the smooth seas and pleasant weather of the tropics, other annoyances occurred to vex the spirit of the captain. He had been crossed by the irritable mood of one of the partners ; he was now excessively annoyed by the good-humor of another. This was the elder Stuart, who was an easy soul, and of a social dis position. He had seen life in Canada, and on the coast of Labrador ; had been a fur trader in the former, and a fisherman on the latter ; and, in the course of his experience, had made various expeditions with voyageurs. He was accustomed, therefore, to the familiarity which prevails between that class and their superiors, and the gossipings which take place among them when seated round a fire at their encampments. Stuart was never so happy as when he could seat himself on the deck with a number of these men round him, in camping style, smoke together, passing the pipe from mouth to mouth, after the manner of the Indians, sing old Canadian boat songs, and tell stories about their hardships and adventures, in the course of which he rivalled Sinbad in his long tales of the sea, about his fishing exploits on the coast of Labrador. This gossiping familiarity shocked the captain's notions of rank and subordination, and nothing was so abhorrent to him as"], [67, "LITERARY CLERKS. 59 the community of pipe between master and man, and their mingling in chorus in the outlandish boat songs. Then there was another whimsical source of annoyance to him. Some of the young clerks, who were making their first voyage, and to whom every thing was new and strange, were, very rationally, in the habit of taking notes and keeping jour nals. This was a sore abomination to the honest captain, who held their literary pretensions in great contempt. \" The collecting of materials for long histories of their voyage and travels,\" said he, in his letter to Mr. Astor, \" appears to engross most of their attention.\" We can conceive what must have been the crusty impatience of the worthy navigator, when, on any trifling occurrence in the course of the voyage, quite commonplace in his eyes, he saw these young landsmen running to record it in their journals ; and what indignant glances he must have cast to right and left, as he worried about the deck, giving out his orders for the management of the ship, surrounded by singing, smoking, gossiping, scribbling groups, all, as he thought, intent upon the amusement of the passing hour, instead of the great purpose and interests of the voyage. It is possible the captain was in some degree right in his notions. Though some of the passengers had much to gain by the voyage, none of them had any thing positively to lose. They were mostly young men, in the heyday of life ; and hav ing got into fine latitudes, upon smooth seas, with a well stored ship under them, and a fair wind in the shoulder of the sail, they seemed to have got into a holiday world, and were dis posed to enjoy it. That craving desire, natural to untravelled men of fresh and lively minds, to see strange lands, and to visit scenes famous in history or fable, was expressed by some of the partners and clerks, with respect to some of the storied coasts and islands that lay within their route. The captain,"], [68, "60 CURIOUS TRAVELLERS. however, who regarded every coast and island with a matter of fact eye, and had no more associations connected with them than those laid down in his seachart, considered all this cu riosity as exceedingly idle and childish. \" In the first part of the voyage,\" says he in his letter, \" they were determined to have it said they had been in Africa, and therefore insisted on my stopping at the Cape de Verds. Next they said the ship should stop on the coast of Patagonia, for they must see the large and uncommon inhabitants of that place. Then they must go to the island where Robinson Crusoe had so long lived. And lastly, they were determined to see the handsome inhabitants of Easter island.\" To all these resolves the captain opposed his peremptory veto, as \" contrary to instructions.\" Then would break forth an unavailing explosion of wrath on the part of certain of the partners, in the course of which they did not even spare Mr. Astor for his act of supererogation in furnishing orders for the control of the ship while they were on board, instead of leav ing them to be the judges, where it would be best for her to touch, and how long to remain. The choleric M'Dougal took the lead in these railings, being, as has been observed, a little puffed up with the idea of being Mr. Astor's proxy. The captain, however, became only so much the more crusty and dogged in his adherence to his orders, and touchy and harsh in his dealings with his passengers, and frequent altercations ensued. He may in some measure have been influenced by his seamanlike impatience of the interference of landsmen, and his high notions of naval etiquette and quarterdeck authority ; but he evidently had an honest, trusty concern for the interests of his employer. He pictured to himself the anxious projector of the enterprise, who had disbursed so munificently in its out fit, calculating on the zeal, fidelity, and singleness of purpose"], [69, "A WILDG00SECHASE. 61 of his associates and agents ; while they, on the other hand, having a good ship at their disposal, and a deep pocket at home to bear them out, seemed ready to loiter on every coast, and amuse themselves in every port. On the fourth of December they came in sight of the Falk land islands. Having been for some time on an allowance of water it was resolved to anchor here and obtain a supply. A boat was sent into a small bay to take soundings. Mr. M'Dougal and Mr. M'Kay took this occasion to go on shore, but with a request from the captain that they would not detain the ship. Once on shore, however, they were in no haste to obey his orders, but rambled about in search of curiosities. The anchorage proving unsafe, and water difficult to be pro cured, the captain stood out to sea, and made repeated signals for those on shore to rejoin the ship, but it was not until nine at night that they came on board. The wind being adverse, the boat was again sent on shore on the following morning, and the same gentlemen again landed, but promised to come off at a moments warning ; they again forgot their promise in their eager pursuit of wild geese and sea wolves. After a time the wind hauled fair, and signals were made for the boat. Half an hour elapsed but no boat put off. The captain reconnoitred the shore with his glass, and, to his infinite vexation, saw the loiterers in the full enjoy ment of their \" wildgoosechase.\" Nettled to the quick, he immediately made sail. When those on shore saw the ship actually under way, they embarked with all speed, but had a hard pull of eight miles before they got on board, and then experienced but a grim reception, notwithstanding that they came well laden with the spoils of the chase. Two days afterwards, on the seventh of December, they anchored at Port Egmont in the same island, where they 6"], [70, "62 PENGUIN SHOOTING EPITAPH HUNTING. remained four days taking in water and making repairs. This was a joyous time for the landsmen. They pitched a tent on shore, had a boat at their command and passed their time merrily in rambling about the island, and coasting along the shores, shooting sea lions, seals, foxes, geese, ducks and pen guins. None were keener in pursuit of this kind of game than M'Dougal and David Stuart ; the latter was reminded of aquatic sports on the coast of Labrador, and his hunting exploits in the north-west. In the meantime the captain addressed himself steadily to the business of his ship, scorning the holiday spirit and useless pursuits of his emancipated messmates, and warning them, from time to time, not to wander away nor be out of hail. They promised, as usual, that the ship should never experience a moment's detention on their account, but, as usual, forgot their promise. On the morning of the 11th, the repairs being all finished, and the water casks replenished, the signal was given to em bark, and the ship began to weigh anchor. At this time several of the passengers were dispersed about the island, amusing themselves in various ways. Some of the young men had found two inscriptions, in English, over a place where two unfortu nate mariners had been buried in this desert island. As the inscriptions were nearly worn out by time and weather, they were playing the part of \" Old Mortality,\" and piously renew ing them. The signal from the ship summoned them from their labors ; they saw the sails unfurled, and that it was getting under way. The two sporting partners, however, Mr. M'Dou gal and David Stuart, had strolled away to the south of the island in pursuit of penguins. It would never do to put off without them, as there was but one boat to convey the whole. While this delay took place on shore, the captain was storm-"], [71, "63 SPORTSMEN IN THE LURCH. ing on board. This was the third time his orders had been tre-ated with contempt, and the ship wantonly detained, and it should be the last ; so he spread all sail and put to sea, swear ing he would leave the laggards to shift for themselves. It was in vain that those on board made remonstrances and entreaties, and represented the horrors of abandoning men upon a sterile and uninhabited island : the sturdy captain was inflexible. In the meantime, the penguin hunters had joined the engra vers of tombstones, but not before the ship was already out at sea. They all, to the number of eight, threw themselves into their boat, which was about twenty feet in length, and rowed with might and main. For three hours and a half did they tug anxiously and severely at the oar, swashed occasionally by the surging waves of the open sea, while the ship inexorably kept on her course, and seemed determined to leave them behind. On board of the ship was the nephew of David Stuart, a young man of spirit and resolution. Seeing, as he thought, the captain obstinately bent upon abandoning his uncle and the others, he seized a pistol, and in a paroxysm of wrath swore he would blow out the captain's brains, unless he put about or shortened sail. Fortunately for all parties, the wind just then came ahead, and the boat was enabled to reach the ship ; otherwise, dis astrous circumstances might have ensued. We can hardly believe that the captain really intended to carry his threat into full effect, and rather think he meant to let the laggards off for a long pull and a hearty fright. He declared, however, in his letter to Mr. Astor, that he was serious in his threats ; and there is no knowing how far such an iron man may push his notions of authority. \" Had the wind,\" writes he, \" (unfortunately) not hauled ahead soon after leaving the harbor's mouth, I should positively have"], [72, "64 CROSS PURPOSES. left them ; and, indeed, I cannot but think it an unfortunate circumstance for you that it so happened, for the first loss in this instance would, in my opinion, have proved the best, as they seem to have no idea of the value of property, nor any apparent regard for your interest, although interwoven with their own.\" This, it must be confessed, was acting with a high hand, and carrying a regard to the owner's property to a dangerous length. Various petty feuds occurred also between him and the partners in respect to the goods on board the ship, some articles of which they wished to distribute for clothing among the men, or for other purposes which they deemed essential. The captain, however, kept a mastiff watch upon the cargo, and growled and snapped if they but offered to touch box or bale. \" It was con trary to orders ; it would forfeit his insurance ; it was out of all rule.\" It was in vain they insisted upon their right to do so, as part owners, and as acting for the good of the enterprise ; the captain only stuck to his point the more staunchly. They consoled themselves, therefore, by declaring, that as soon as they made land they would assert their rights, and do with ship and cargo as they pleased. Beside these feuds between the captain and the partners, there were feuds between the partners themselves, occasioned, in some measure, by jealousy of rank. M'Dougal and M'Kay began to draw plans for the fort, and other buildings of the intended establishment. They agreed very well as to the outline and dimensions, which were on a sufficiently grand scale ; but when they came to arrange the details, fierce dis putes arose, and they would quarrel by the hour about the distribution of the doors and windows. Many were the hard words and hard names bandied between them on these occa sions, according to the captain's account. Each accused the"], [73, "ARRIVAL AT OWYHEE. 65 other of endeavoring to assume unwarrantable power, and to take the lead ; upon which Mr. M'Dougal would vauntingly lay down Mr. Astor's letter, constituting him his representative and proxy, a document not to be disputed. These wordy contests, though violent, were brief; \"and within fifteen minutes,\" says the captain, \" they would be caressing each other like children.\" While all this petty anarchy was agitating the little world within the Tonquin, the good ship prosperously pursued her course, doubled Cape Horn on the 25th of December, careered across the bosom of the Pacific, until, on the 11th of February, the snowy peaks of Owyhee were seen brightening above the horizon. 6*"], [74, "66 OWYHEE CHAPTER VI.

Owyhee, or Hawaii as it is written by more exact orthogra phers, is the largest of the cluster, ten in number, of the Sand wich islands. It is about ninety-seven miles in length, and seventy-eight in breadth, rising gradually into three pyramidal summits or cones ; the highest, Mouna Roa, being eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, so as to domineer over the whole Archipelago, and to be a landmark over a wide extent of ocean. It remains a lasting monument of the en terprising and unfortunate Captain Cook, who was murdered by the natives of this island. The Sandwich islanders, when first discovered, evinced a character superior to most of the savages of the Pacific isles. They were frank and open in their deportment, friendly and liberal in their dealings, with an apt ingenuity apparent in all their rude inventions. The tragical fate of the discoverer, which, for a time, brought them under the charge of ferocity, was, in fact, the"], [75, "TAMAAHMAAH HIS NAVY. 67 result of sudden exasperation, caused by the seizure of their chief. At the time of the. visit of the Tonquin, the islanders had profited, in many respects, by occasional intercourse with white men ; and had shown a quickness to observe and culti vate those arts important to their mode of living. Originally they had no means of navigating the seas by which they were surrounded, superior to light pirogues, which were little com petent to contend with the storms of the broad ocean. As the islands are not in sight of each other, there could, therefore, be but casual intercourse between them. The traffic with white men had put them in possession of vessels of superior description ; they had made themselves acquainted with their management, and had even made rude advances in the art of ship building. These improvements had been promoted, in a great measure, by the energy and sagacity of one man, the famous Tamaah maah. He had originally been a petty eri, or chief; but, being of an intrepid and aspiring nature, he had risen in rank, and, availing himself of the superior advantages now afforded in navigation, had brought the whole Archipelago in subjection to his arms. At the time of the arrival of the Tonquin he had about forty schooners, of from twenty to thirty tons burthen, and one old American ship. With these he maintained undis puted sway over his insular domains, and carried on an inter course with the chiefs or governors whom he had placed in command of the several islands. The situation of this group of islands, far in the bosom of the vast Pacific, and their abundant fertility, rendered them important stopping places on the highway to China, or to the north-west coast of America. Here the vessels engaged in the fur trade touched to make repairs and procure provisions ;"], [76, "68 HIS VISIT TO ENGLAND. and here they often sheltered themselves during the winters that occurred in their long coasting expeditions. The British navigators were, from the first, aware of the value of these islands to the purposes of commerce ; and Tamaahmaah, not long after he had attained the sovereign sway, was persuaded by Vancouver, the celebrated discoverer, to acknowledge, on behalf of himself and subjects, allegiance to the king of Great Britain. The reader cannot but call to mind the visit which tbe royal family and court of the Sandwich islands was, in late years, induced to make to the court of St. James ; and the serio-comic ceremonials and mock parade which attended that singular travesty of monarchal style. It was a part of the wide and comprehensive plan of Mr. Astor to establish a friendly intercourse between these islands and his intended colony, which might, for a time, have occa sion to draw supplies thence ; and he even had a vague idea of, some time or other, getting possession of one of their islands as a rendezvous for his ships, and a link in the chain of his commercial establishments. On the evening of the 12th of February the Tonquin anchored in the bay of Karakakooa, in the island of Owyhee. The surrounding shores were wild and broken, with over hanging cliffs and precipices of black volcanic rock. Beyond these, however, the country was fertile and well cultivated, with enclosures of yams, plantains, sweet potatoes, sugar canes, and other productions of warm climates and teeming soils ; and the numerous habitations of the natives were pleas antly sheltered beneath clumps of cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees, which afforded both food and shade. This mingled variety of garden and grove swept gradually up the sides of the mountains, until succeeded by dense forests, which in"], [77, "W0AH00 ROYAL MONOPOLY*. 69 turn gave place to naked and craggy rocks, until the summits rose into the regions of perpetual snow. The royal residence of Tamaahmaah was at this time at another island named Woahoo. The island of Owyhee was under the command of one of his eris, or chiefs, who resided at the village of Tocaigh, situated on a different part of the coast from the bay of Karakakooa. On the morning after her arrival, the ship was surrounded by canoes and pirogues, filled with the islanders of both sexes, bringing off supplies of fruits and vegetables, bananas, plantains, watermelons, yams, cabbages, and taro. The cap tain was desirous, however, of purchasing a number of hogs, but there were none to be had. The trade in pork was a royal monopoly, and no subject of the great Tamaahmaah dared to meddle with it. Such provisions as they could fur nish, however, were brought by the natives in abundance, and a lively intercourse was kept up during the day, in which the women mingled in the kindest manner. The islanders are a comely race, of a copper complexion. The men are tall and well made, with forms indicating strength and activity ; the women with regular and occasion ally handsome features, and a lascivious expression, charac teristic of their temperament. Their style of dress was nearly the same as in the days of Captain Cook. The men wore the maro, a band one foot in width and several feet in length, swathed round the loins, and formed of tappa, or cloth of bark ; the kihei, or mantle, about six feet square, tied in a knot over one shoulder, passed under the opposite arm, so as to leave it bare, and falling in graceful folds before and behind, to the knee, so as to bear some resemblance to a Roman toga. The female dress consisted of the pau, a garment formed of a piece of tappa, several yards in length and one in width,"], [78, "70 A DANCE AN ISLAND CHRONICLER. wrapped round the waist, and reaching like a petticoat, to the knees. Over this a kihei or mantle, larger than that of the men, sometimes worn over both shoulders, like a shawl, some times over one only. These mantles were seldom worn by either sex during the heat of the day, when the exposure of their persons was at first very revolting to a civilized eye. Towards evening several of the partners and clerks went on shore, where they were well received and hospitably entertained. A dance was performed for their amusement, in which nineteen young women and one man figured very gracefully, singing in concert, and moving to the cadence of their song. All this, however, was nothing to the purpose in the eyes of Captain Thorn, who, being disappointed in his hope of obtaining a supply of pork, or finding good water, was anxious to be off. This it was not so easy to effect. The passengers, once on shore, were disposed, as usual, to profit by the occasion. The partners had many inquiries to make relative to the island, with a view to business ; while the young clerks were delighted with the charms and graces of the dancing damsels. To add to their gratifications, an old man offered to conduct them to the spot where Captain Cook was massacred. The proposition was eagerly accepted, and all hands set out on a pilgrimage to the place. The veteran islander performed his promise faithfully, and pointed out the very spot where the unfortunate discoverer fell. The rocks and cocoa trees around bore record of the fact, in the marks of the balls fired from the boats upon the savages. The pilgrims gathered round the old man, and drew from him all the particulars he had to relate respecting this memorable event ; while the honest captain stood by and bit his nails with impatience."], [79, "A NAUTICAL GOVERNOR. 71 To add to his vexation, they employed themselves in knock ing off pieces of the rocks, and cutting off the bark of the trees marked by the balls, which they conveyed back to the ship as precious relics. Right glad, therefore, was he to get them and their trea sures fairly on board, when he made sail from this unprofitable place, and steered for the bay of Tocaigh, the residence of the chief or governor of the island, where he hoped to be more successful in obtaining supplies. On coming to anchor the captain went on shore, accompanied by Mr. M'Dougal and Mr. M'Kay, and paid a visit to the governor. This dignitary proved to be an old sailor, by the name of John Young ; who, after being tossed about the seas like another Sinbad, had, by one of the whimsical freaks of fortune, been elevated to the government of a savage island. He received his visiters with more hearty familiarity than personages in his high station are apt to indulge, but soon gave them to understand that provisions were scanty at Tocaigh, and that there was no good water, no rain having fallen in the neighborhood in three years. The captain was immediately for breaking up the confer ence and departing, but the partners were not so willing to part with the nautical governor, who seemed disposed to be extremely communicative, and from whom they might be able to procure some useful information. A long conversation accordingly ensued, in the course of which they made many inquiries about the affairs of the islands, their natural produc tions, and the possibility of turning them to advantage in the way of trade ; nor did they fail to inquire into the individual history of John Young, and how he came to be governor. This he gave with great condescension, running through the whole course of his fortunes \" even from his boyish days.\""], [80, "72 STORY OF JOHN YOUNG. He was a native of Liverpool, in England, and had fol lowed the sea from his boyhood, until, by dint of good conduct, he had risen so far in his profession as to be boat swain of an American ship called the Eleanor, commanded by Captain Metcalf. In this vessel he had sailed in 1789, on one of those casual expeditions to the north-west coast, in quest of furs. In the course of the voyage, the captain left a small schooner named the Fair American, at Nootka, with a crew of five men, commanded by his son, a youth of eighteen. She was to fo'low on in the track of the Eleanor. In February, 1790, Captain Metcalf touched at the island of Mowee, one of the Sandwich group. While anchored here, a boat which was astern of the Eleanor was stolen, and a seaman who was in it was killed. The natives, generally, disclaimed the outrage, and brought the shattered remains of the boat and the dead body of the seaman to the ship. Supposing that they had thus appeased the anger of the captain, they thronged, as usual, in great numbers about the vessel, to trade. Captain Metcalf, however, determined on a bloody revenge. The Eleanor mounted ten guns ; all these he ordered to be loaded with musket balls, nails, and pieces of old iron, and then fired them, and the small arms of the ship, among the natives. The havoc was dreadful ; more than a hundred, according to Young's account, were slain. After this signal act of vengeance Captain Metcalf sailed from Mowee, and made for the island of Owyhee, where he was well received by Tamaahmaah. The fortunes of this warlike chief were at that time on the rise. He had origin ally been of inferior rank, ruling over only one or two districts in Owyhee, but had gradually made himself sovereign of his native island. The Eleanor remained some few days at anchor here,"], [81, "STORY OF JOHN YOUNG. 73 and an apparently friendly intercourse was kept up with the inhabitants. On the 17th March, John Young obtained per mission to pass the night on shore. On the following morning a signal gun summoned him to return on board. He went to the shore to embark, but found all the canoes hauled up on the beach and rigorously tabooed, or interdicted. He would have launched one himself, but was informed by Tamaahmaah that if he presumed to do so he would be put to death. Young was obliged to submit, and remained all day in great perplexity to account for this mysterious taboo, and fearful that some hostility was intended. In the evening he learned the cause of it, and his uneasiness was increased. It appeared that the vindictive act of Captain Metcalf had recoiled upon his own head. The schooner Fair American, commanded by his son, following in his track, had fallen into the hands of the natives to the southward of Tocaigh bay, and young Met calf and four of the crew had been massacred. On receiving intelligence of this event, Tamaahmaah had immediately tabooed all the canoes, and interdicted all inter course with the ship, lest the captain should learn the fate of the schooner, and take his revenge upon the island. For the same reason he prevented Young from rejoining his country men. The Eleanor continued to fire signals from time to time for two days, and then sailed ; concluding, no doubt, that the boatswain had deserted. John Young was in despair when he saw the ship make sail, and found himself abandoned among savages ; \u2014 and savages, too, sanguinary in their character, and inflamed by acts of hostility. He was agreeably disappointed, however, in expe riencing nothing but kind treatment from Tamaahmaah and his people. It is true, he was narrowly watched whenever a"], [82, "74 PROMOTION IN SAVAGE LIFE. vessel came in sight, lest he should escape and relate what had passed; but at other times he was treated with entire confidence and great distinction. He became a prime favor ite, cabinet counsellor, and active coadjutor of Tamaahmaah, attending him in all his excursions, whether of business or pleasure, and aiding in his warlike and ambitious enterprises. By degrees he rose to the rank of a chief, espoused one of the beauties of the island, and became habituated and recon ciled to his new way of life ; thinking it better, perhaps, to rule among savages than serve among white men ; to be a feathered chief than a tarpawling boatswain. His favor with Tamaahmaah never declined ; and when that sagacious, intre pid, and aspiring chieftain had made himself sovereign over the whole group of islands, and removed his residence to Woahoo, he left his faithful adherent John Young in command of Owyhee. Such is an outline of the history of Governor Young, as furnished by himself; and we regret that we are not able to give any account of the state maintained by tliK seafaring worthy, and the manner in which he discharged his high functions ; though it is evident he had more of the hearty familiarity of the forecastle than the dignity of the guberna torial office. These long conferences were bitter trials to the patience of the captain, who had no respect either for the governor or his island, and was anxious to push on in quest of provisions and water. As soon as he could get his inquisitive partners once more on board, he weighed anchor, and made sail for the island of Woahoo, the royal residence of Tamaahmaah. This is the most beautiful island of the Sandwich group. It is forty-six miles in length and twenty-three in breadth. A ridge of volcanic mountains extends through the centre, rising"], [83, "A ROYAL VISIT GRAND CEREMONIALS. 75 into lofty peaks, and skirted by undulating hills and rich plains, where the cabins of the natives peep out from beneath groves of cocoa-nut and other luxuriant trees. On the 21st of February the Tonquin cast anchor in the beautiful bay before the village of Waititi, (pronounced Why teetee,) the abode of Tamaahmaah. This village contained about two hundred habitations, composed of poles set in the ground, tied together at the ends, and thatched with grass, and was situated in an open grove of cocoa-nuts. The royal palace of Tamaahmaah was a large house of two stories ; the lower of stone, the upper of wood. Round this his body guard kept watch, composed of twenty-four men, in long blue cassocks turned up with yellow, and each armed with a musket. While at anchor at this place, much ceremonious visiting and long conferences took place between the potentate of the islands and the partners of the company. Tamaahmaah came on board of the ship in royal style, in his double pirogue. He was between fifty and sixty years of age, above the middle size, large and well made, though somewhat corpulent. He was dressed in an old suit of regimentals, with a sword by his side, and seemed somewhat embarrassed by his magnificent attire. Three of his wives accompanied him. They were almost as tall, and quite as corpulent as himself ; but by no means to be compared with him in grandeur of habiliments, wearing no other garb than the pau. With him, also, came his great favorite and confidential counsellor, Kraimaker ; who, from holding a post equivalent to that of prime minister, had been familiarly named Billy Pitt by the British visiters to the islands. The sovereign was received with befitting ceremonial. The American flag was displayed, four guns were fired, and"], [84, "76 TITLES AND CEREMONIALS. the partners appeared in scarlet coats, and conducted their illustrious guests to the cabin, where they were regaled with wine. In this interview the partners endeavored to impress the monarch with a sense of their importance, and of the importance of the association to which they belonged. They let him know that they were eris, or chiefs, of a great company about to be established on the north-west coast, and talked of the probability of opening a trade with his islands, and of sending ships there occasionally. All this was gratifying and interesting to him, for he was aware of the advantages of trade, and desirous of promoting frequent intercourse with white men. He encouraged Europeans and Americans to settle in his islands and intermarry with his subjects. There were between twenty and thirty white men ut that time resident in the island, but many of them were mere vagabonds, who remained there in hopes of leading a lazy and an easy life. For such Tamaahmaah had a great contempt ; those only had his esteem and countenance who knew some trade or mechanic art, and were sober and industrious. On the day subsequent to the monarch's visit, the partners landed and waited upon him in return. Knowing the effect of show and dress upon men in savage life, and wishing to make a favorable impression as the eris, or chiefs, of the great American Fur Company, some of them appeared in Highland plaids and kelts, to the great admiration of the natives. While visits of ceremony and grand diplomatic conferences were going on between the partners and the king, the captain, in his plain, matter-of-fact way, was pushing what he con sidered a far more important negotiation : the purchase of a supply of hogs. He found that the king had profited in more"], [85, "77 A ROY'AL PORK MERCHANT. ways than one by his intercourse with white men. Above all other arts he had learned the art of driving a bargain. He was a magnanimous monarch, but a shrewd pork merchant ; and perhaps thought he could not do better with his future allies, the American Fur Company, than to begin by close dealing. Several interviews were requisite, and much bar gaining, before he could be brought to part with a bristle of his bacon, and then he insisted upon being paid in hard Spanish dollars ; giving as a reason that he wanted money to purchase a frigate from his brother George, as he affection ately termed the king of England.* At length the royal bargain was concluded ; the necessary supply of hogs obtained, beside several goats, two sheep, a quantity of poultry, and vegetables in abundance. The part ners now urged to recruit their forces from the natives of this island. They declared they had never seen watermen equal to them, even among the voyageurs of the north-west ; and, * It appears, from the accounts of subsequent voyagers, that Tamaah maah afterwards succeeded in his wish of purchasing a large ship. In tliis he sent a cargo of sandal wood to Canton, having discovered that the foreign merchants trading with him made large profits on tliis wood, shipped by them from the islands to the Chinese markets. The ship was manned by natives, but the officers were Englishmen. She accomplished her voyage, and returned in safety to the islands, with the Hawaiian flag floating glori ously in the breeze. The king hastened on board, expecting to find his sandal wood converted into crapes and damasks, and other rich stuffs of China, but found, to his astonishment, by the legerdemain of traffic, his car^o had all disappeared, and, in place of it, remained a bill of charges amountin\"to three thousand dollars. It was some time before he could be maule to comprehend certain of the most important items of the bill, such as pilotage, anchorage, and custom-house fees ; but when he discovered that maritime states in other countries derived large revenues in this manner, to the great cost of the merchant, \" Well,\" cried he, \" then I will have harbor fees also.\" He established them accordingly. Pilotage a dollar a foot on the draft of each vessel. Anchorage from sixty to seventy dollars. In this way he greatly increased the royal revenue, and turned his China speculation to account. 7'"], [86, "78 COMMENTS OF A MATTER-OF-FACT MAN. indeed, they are remarkable for their skill in managing their light craft, and can swim and dive like waterfowl. The partners were inclined therefore, to take thirty or forty with them to the Columbia, to be employed in the service of the company. The captain, however, objected that there was not room in his vessel for the accommodation of such a number. Twelve, only, were therefore enlisted for the company, and as many more for the service of the ship. The former engaged to serve for the term of three years, during which they were to be fed and clothed ; and at the expiration of the time were to receive one hundred dollars in merchandise. And now, having embarked his live stock, fruits, vegetables, and water, the captain made ready to set sail. How much the honest man had suffered in spirit by what he considered the freaks and vagaries of his passengers, and how little he had understood their humors and intentions, is amusingly shown in a letter written to Mr. Astor from Woahoo, which contains his comments on the scenes we have described. \" It would be difficult,\" he writes, \" to imagine the frantic gambols that are daily played off here ; sometimes dressing in red coats, and otherwise very fantastically, and collecting a number of ignorant natives around them, telling them they are the great eares of the north-west, and making arrange ments for sending three or four vessels yearly to them from the coast with spars, &c. ; while those very natives cannot even furnish a hog to the ship.

It was on the 28th of February that the Tonquin set sail from the Sandwich islands. For two days the wind was contrary, and the vessel was detained in their neighborhood ; at length a favorable breeze sprang up, and in a little while the rich groves, green hills, and snowy peaks of those happy islands one after another sank from sight, or melted into the blue distance, and the Tonquin ploughed her course towards the sterner regions of the Pacific. The misunderstandings between the captain and his pas sengers still continued ; or rather, increased in gravity. By his altercations and his moody humors, he had cut himself off from all community of thought, or freedom of conversation with them. He disdained to ask any questions as to their proceedings, and could only guess at the meaning of their movements, and in so doing indulged in conjectures and suspicions, which produced the most whimsical self-torment. Thus, in one of his disputes with them, relative to the goods on board, some of the packages of which they wished to open, to take out articles of clothing for the men or presents for the natives, he was so harsh and peremptory that they lost"], [89, "MISERIES OF A SUSPICIOUS MAN. 81 all patience, and hinted that they were the strongest party, and might reduce him to a very ridiculous dilemma, by taking from him the command. A thought now flashed across the captain's mind that they really had a design to depose him, and that, having picked up some information at Owyhee, possibly of war between the United States and England, they meant to alter the destination of the voyage ; perhaps to seize upon ship and cargo for their own use. Once having conceived this suspicion, every thing went to foster it. They had distributed fire-arms among some of their men, a common precaution among the fur traders when mingling with the natives. This, however, looked like prepa ration. Then several of the partners and clerks and some of the men, being Scotsmen, were acquainted with the Gaelic, and held long conversations together in that language. These conversations were considered by the captain of a \" myste rious and unwarrantable nature,\" and related, no doubt, to some foul conspiracy that was brewing among them. He frankly avows such suspicions, in his letter to Mr. Astor, but intimatos that he stood ready to resist any treasonous out break ; and seems to think that the evidence of preparation on his part had an effect in overawing the conspirators. The fact is, as we have since been informed by one of the parties, it was a mischievous pleasure with some of the partners and clerks, who were young men, to play upon the suspicious temper and splenetic humors of the captain. To this we may ascribe many of their whimsical pranks and absurd propositions, and, above all, their mysterious colloquys in Gaelic. In this sore and irritable mood did the captain pursue his course, keeping a wary eye on every movement, and bristling"], [90, "82 THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA. up whenever the detested sound of the Gaelic language grated upon his ear. Nothing occurred, however, materially to disturb the residue of the voyage excepting a violent storm ; and, on the twenty-second of March, the Tonquin arrived at the mouth of the Oregon, or Columbia river. The aspect of the river and the adjacent coast was wild and dangerous. The mouth of the Columbia is upwards of four miles wide, with a peninsula and promontory on one side, and a long low spit of land on the other ; between which a sand bar and chain of breakers almost block up the entrance. The interior of the country rises into successive ranges of moun tains, which, at the time of the arrival of the Tonquin, were covered with snow. A fresh wind from the north-west sent a rough tumbling sea upon the coast, which broke upon the bar in furious surges, and extended a sheet of foam almost across the mouth of the river. Under these circumstances the captain did not think it prudent to approach within three leagues, until the bar should be sounded and the channel ascertained. Mr. Fox, the chief mate, was ordered to this service in the whale boat, accompanied by John Martin, an old seaman, who had formerly visited the river, and by three Canadians. Fox requested to have regular sailors to man the boat, but the captain would not spare them from the service of the ship, and supposed the Canadians, being expert boatmen on lakes and rivers, were competent to the service, especially when directed and aided by Fox and Martin. Fox seems to have lost all firmness of spirit on the occasion, and to have regarded the service with a misgiving heart. He came to the partners for sympathy, knowing their differences with the captain, and the tears were in his eyes as he represented his case. \" I am sent off,\" said he, \" without seamen to man my boat, in"], [91, "BARS AND BREAKERS. 83 boisterous weather, and on the most dangerous part of the north-west coast. My uncle was lost a few years ago on this same bar, and I am now going to lay my bones along side of his.\" The partners sympathized in his apprehensions, and remonstrated with the captain. The latter, however, was not to be moved. He had been displeased with Mr. Fox in the earlier part of the voyage, considering him indolent and inac tive ; and probably thought his present repugnance arose from a want of true nautical spirit. The interference of the part ners in the business of the ship, also, was not calculated to have a favorable effect on a stickler for authority like himself, especially in his actual state of feeling towards them. At one o'clock, P. M., therefore, Fox and bis comrades set off in the whale-boat, which is represented as small in size, and crazy in condition. All eyes were strained after the little bark as it pulled for shore, rising and sinking with the huge rolling waves, until it entered, a mere speck, among the foam ing breakers, and was soon lost to view. Evening set in, night succeeded and passed away, and morning returned, but without the return of the boat. As the wind had moderated, the ship stood near to the land, so as to command a view of the river's mouth. Nothing was to be seen but a wild chaos of tumbling waves breaking upon the bar, and apparently forming a foaming barrier from shore to shore. Towards night the ship again stood out to gain sea-room, and a gloom was visible in every countenance. The captain himself shared in the general anxiety, and pro bably repented of his peremptory orders. Another weary and watchful night succeeded, during which the wind subsided, and the weather became serene. On the following day, the ship having drifted near the land, anchored in fourteen fathoms water, to the northward of the"], [92, "84 PERILOUS SERVICE. long peninsula or promontory which forms the north side of the entrance, and is called Cape Disappointment. The pin nace was then manned, and two of the partners, Mr. David Stuart and Mr. M'Kay, set off in the hope of learning some thing of the fate of the whale-boat. The surf, however, broke with such violence along the shore that they could find no landing place. Several of the natives appeared on the beach and made signs to them to row round the cape, but they thought it most prudent to return to the ship. The wind now springing up, the Tonquin got under way, and stood in to seek the channel ; but was again deterred, by the frightful aspect of the breakers, from venturing within a league. Here she hove to ; and Mr. Mumford, the second mate, was dispatched with four hands, in the pinnace, to sound across the channel until he should find four fathoms depth. The pinnace entered among the breakers, but was near being lost, and with difficulty got back to the ship. The captain insisted that Mr. Mumford had steered too much to the southward. He now turned to Mr. Aiken, an able mar iner, destined to command the schooner intended for the coasting trade, and ordered him, together with John Coles, sail-maker, Stephen Weekes, armorer, and two Sandwich islanders, to proceed ahead and take soundings, while the ship should follow under easy sail. In this way they pro ceeded until Aiken had ascertained the channel, when signal was given from the ship for him to return on board. He was then within pistol shot, but so furious was the current, and tumultuous the breakers, that the boat became unmanageable, and was hurried away, the crew crying out piteously for assistance. In a few moments she could not be seen from the ship's deck. Some of the passengers climbed to the mizzen top, and beheld her still struggling to reach the ship ; but"], [93, "THE SHIP IN DANGER. 85 shortly after she broached broadside to the waves, and her case seemed desperate. The attention of those on board of the ship was now called to their own safety. They were in shallow water ; the vessel struck repeatedly, the waves broke over her, and there was danger of her foundering. At length she got into seven fathoms water, and the wind lulling, and the night coming on, cast anchor. With the darkness their anxieties increased. The wind whistled, the sea roared, the gloom was only broken by the ghastly glare of the foaming breakers, the minds of the seamen were full of dreary appre hensions, and some of them fancied they heard the cries of their lost comrades mingling with the uproar of the elements For a time, too, the rapidly ebbing tide threatened to sweep them from their precarious anchorage. At length the reflux of the tide, and the springing up of the wind, enabled them to quit their dangerous situation and take shelter in a small bay within Cape Disappointment, where they rode in safety during the residue of a stormy night, and enjoyed a brief interval of refreshing sleep. With the light of day returned their cares and anxieties. They looked out from the mast head over a wild coast, and wilder sea, but could discover no trace of the two boats and their crews that were missing. Several of the natives came on board with peltries, but there was no disposition to trade. They were interrogated by signs after the lost boats, but could not understand the inquiries. Parties now went on shore and scoured the neighborhood. One of these was headed by the captain. They had not proceeded far when they beheld a person at a distance in civilized garb. As he drew near he proved to be Weekes, the armorer. There was a burst of joy, for it was hoped his comrades were near at hand. His story, however, was one 8"], [94, "86 STORY OF WEEKES THE ARMORER. of disaster. He and his companions had found it impossible to govern their boat, having no rudder, and being beset by rapid and whirling currents and boisterous surges. After long struggling they had let her go at the mercy of the waves, tossing about, sometimes with her bow, sometimes with her broadside to the surges, threatened each instant with destruc tion, yet repeatedly escaping, until a huge sea broke over and swamped her. Weekes was overwhelmed by the boiling waves, but emerging above the surface, looked round for his companions. Aikin and Coles were not to be seen ; near him were the two Sandwich islanders, stripping themselves of their clothing that they might swim more freely. He did the same, and the boat floating near to him he seized hold of it. The two islanders joined him, and, uniting their forces, they succeeded in turning the boat upon her keel ; then bearing down her stern and rocking her, they forced out so much water that she was able to bear the weight of a man without sinking. One of the islanders now got in, and in a little while bailed out the water with his hands. The other swam about and collected the oars, and they all three got once more on board. By this time the tide had swept them beyond the breakers, and Weekes called on his companions to row for land. They were so chilled and benumbed by the cold, however, that they lost all heart, and absolutely refused. Weekes was equally chilled, but had superior sagacity and self-command. He counteracted the tendency to drowsiness and stupor which cold produces by keeping himself in constant exercise ; and seeing that the vessel was advancing, and that every thing depended upon himself, he set to work to scull the boat clear of the bar, and into quiet water. Towards midnight one of the poor islanders expired: his"], [95, "87 SEARCH FOR A LOST COMRADE. companion threw himself on his corpse and could not be per suaded to leave him. The dismal night wore away amidst these horrors : as the day dawned, Weekes found himself near the land. He steered directly for it, and at length, with the aid of the surf, ran his boat high upon a sandy beach. Finding that one of the Sandwich islanders yet gave signs of life, he aided him to leave the boat, and set out with him towards the adjacent woods. The poor fellow, however, was too feeble to follow him, and Weekes was soon obliged to abandon him to his fate and provide for his own safety. Fall ing upon a beaten path, he pursued it, and after a few hours came to a part of the coast where, to his surprise and joy, he beheld the ship at anchor, and was met by the captain and his party. After Weekes had related his adventures, three parties were dispatched to beat up the coist in search of the unfor tunate islander. They returned at night without success, though they had used the utmost diligence. On the following day the search was resumed, and the poor fellow was at length discovered lying beneath a group of rocks, his legs swollen, his feet torn and bloody from walking through bushes and briars, and himself half dead with cold, hunger, and fatigue. Weekes and this islander were the only survivors of the crew of the jolly-boat, and no trace was ever discovered of Fox and his party. Thus eight men were lost on the first approach to the coast ; a commencement that cast a gloom over the spirits of the whole party, and was regarded by some of the superstitious as an omen that boded no good to the enterprise. Towards night the Sandwich islanders went on shore, to bury the body of their unfortunate countryman who had per ished in the boat. On arriving at the place where it had been"], [96, "88 FUNERAL OF A SANDWICH ISLANDER. lest, they dug a grave in the sand, in which they deposited the corpse, with a biscuit under one of the arms, some lard under the chin, and a small quantity of tobacco, as provisions for its journey in the land of spirits. Having covered the body with sand and flints, they kneeled along the grave in a double row, with their faces turned to the east, while one who officiated as a priest sprinkled them with water from a hat. In so doing he recited a kind of prayer or invocation, to which, at intervals, the others made responses. Such were the simple rites performed by these poor savages at tbe grave of their comrade on the shores of a strange land ; and when these were done, they rose and returned in silence to the ship, without once casting a look behind."], [97, "MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA. 89 CHAPTER VIII.

The Columbia, or Oregon, for the distance of thirty or forty miles from its entrance into the sea, is, properly speaking, a mere estuary, indented by deep bays so as to vary from three to seven miles in width ; and is rendered extremely intricate and dangerous by shoals reaching nearly from shore to shore, on which, at times, the winds and currents produce foaming and tumultuous breakers. The mouth of the river proper is but about half a mile wide, formed by the contracting shores of the estuary. The entrance from the sea, as we have already observed, is bounded on the south side by a flat sandy spit of land, stretching into the ocean. This is commonly called Point Adams. The opposite, or northern side, is Cape Disappointment ; a kind of peninsula, terminating in a steep knoll or promontory crowned with a forest of pine trees, and connected with the main land by a low and narrow neck. Immediately within this cape is a wide, open bay, terminating at Chinook point, so called from a neighboring tribe of Indians. 8*"], [98, "90 THE NATIVE TRIBES. This was called Baker's bay, and here the Tonquin was anchored. The natives inhabiting the lower part of the river, and with whom the company was likely to have the most frequent intercourse, were divided at this time into four tribes, the Chinooks, Clatsops, Wahkiacums, and Cathlamahs. They resembled each other in person, dress, language, and manner ; and were probably from the same stock, but broken into tribes, or rather hordes, by those feuds and schisms frequent among Indians. These people generally live by fishing. It is true they occasionally hunt the elk and deer, and ensnare the waterfowl of their ponds and rivers, but these are casual luxuries. Their chief subsistence is derived from the salmon and other fish which abound in the Columbia and its tributary streams, aided by roots and herbs, especially the wappatoo, which is found on the islands of the river. As the Indians of the plains who depend upon the chase are bold and expert riders, and pride themselves upon their horses, so these piscatory tribes of the coast excel in the man agement of canoes, and are never more at home than when riding upon the waves. Their canoes vary in form and size. Some are upwards of fifty feet long, cut out of a single tree, either fir or white cedar, and capable of carrying thirty per sons. They have thwart pieces from side to side about three inches thick, and their gunwales flare outwards, so as to cast off the surges of the waves. The bow and stern are deco rated with grotesque figures of men and animals, sometimes five feet in height. In managing their canoes they kneel two and two along the bottom, sitting on their heels, and wielding paddles from four to five feet long, while one sets on the stern and steers with a"], [99, "91 HUNTING INDIANS AND FISHING INDIANS. paddle of the same kind. The women are equally expert with the men in managing the canoe, and generally take the helm. It is surprising to see with what fearless unconcern these savages venture in their light barks upon the roughest and most tempestuous seas. They seem to ride upon the waves bke seafowl. Should a surge throw the canoe upon its side and endanger its overturn, those to windward lean over the upper gunwale, thrust their paddles deep into the wave, apparently catch the water and force it under the canoe, and by this action, not merely regain an equilibrium, but give their bark a vigorous impulse forward. The effect of different modes of life upon the human frame and human character is strikingly instanced in the contrast between the hunting Indians of the prairies, and the piscatory Indians of the seacoast. The former, continually on horse back scouring the plains, gaining their food by hardy exer cise, and subsisting chiefly on flesh, are generally tall, sinewy, meagre, but well formed, and of bold and fierce deportment : the latter, lounging about the river banks, or squatting and curved up in their canoes, are generally low in stature, ill shaped, with crooked legs, thick ankles, and broad flat feet. They are inferior also in muscular power and activity, and in game qualities and appearance to their hard-riding brethren of the prairies. Having premised these few particulars concerning the neighboring Indians, we will return to the immediate concerns of the Tonquin and her crew. Further search was made for Mr. Fox and his party, but with no better success, and they were at length given up as lost. In the meantime, the captain and some of the partners explored the river for some distance in a large boat, to select"], [100, "92 POINT GEORGE. a suitable place for the trading post. Their old jealousies and differences continued ; they never could coincide in theii choice, and the captain objected altogether to any site so high up the river. They all returned, therefore, to Baker's bay in no very good-humor. The partners proposed to examine the opposite shore, but the captain was impatient of any further delay. His eagerness to \" get on \" had increased upon him He thought all these excursions a sheer loss of time, and was resolved to land at once, build a shelter for the reception of that part of his cargo destined for the use of the settlement, and, having cleared his ship of it and of his irksome ship mates, to depart upon the prosecution of his coasting voyage, according to orders. On the following day, therefore, without troubling himself to consult the partners, he landed in Baker's bay, and pro ceeded to erect a shed for the reception of the rigging, equip ments, and stores of the schooner that was to be built for the use of the settlement. This dogged determination on the part of the sturdy captain gave high offence to Mr. M'Dougal, who now considered him self at the head of the concern, as Mr. Astor's representative and proxy. He set off the same day, (April 5th,) accompa nied by Mr. David Stuart, for the southern shore, intending to be back by the seventh. Not having the captain to contend with, they soon pitched upon a spot which appeared to them favorable for the intended establishment. It was on a point of land called point George, having a very good harbor, where vessels, not exceeding two hundred tons burthen, might anchor within fifty yards of the shore. After a day thus profitably spent, they re-crossed the river, but landed on the northern shore, several miles above the anchoring ground of the Tonquin, in the neighborhood of"], [101, "93 COMCOMLY AND THE CHINOOKS. Chinook, and visited the village of that tribe. Here they were received with great hospitality by the chief, who was named Comcomly, a shrewd old savage, with but one eye, who will occasionally figure in this narrative. Each village forms a petty sovereignty, governed by its own chief, who, however, possesses but little authority, unless he be a man of wealth and substance ; that is to say, possessed of canoes, slaves, and wives. The greater number of these, the greater is the chief. How many wives this one-eyed potentate main tained we are not told, but he certainly possessed great sway, not merely over his own tribe, but over the neighborhood. Having mentioned slaves, we would observe that slavery exists among several of the tribes beyond the Rocky moun tains. The slaves are well treated while in good health, but occupied in all kinds of drudgery. Should they become useless, however, by sickness or old age, they are totally neglected, and left to perish ; nor is any respect paid to their bodies after death. A singular custom prevails, not merely among the Chinooks, but among most of the tribes about this part of the coast, which is the flattening of the forehead. The process by which this deformity is effected commences immediately after birth. The infant is laid in a wooden trough, by way of cradle. The end on which the head reposes is higher than the rest. A padding is placed on the forehead of the infant, with a piece of bark above it, and is pressed down by cords, which pass through holes on each side of the trough. As the tightening of the padding and the pressing of the head to the board is gradual, the process is said not to be attended with much pain. The appearance of the infant, however, while in this state of compression, is whimsically hideous, and \" its little black eyes,\" we are told, \" being forced out by the tight-"], [102, "94 AN ARISTOCRACY OF FLATHEADS ness of the bandages, resemble those of a mouse choked in a trap.\" About a year's pressure is sufficient to produce the desired effect, at the end of which time the child emerges from its bandages a complete flathead, and continues so through life. It must be noted, however, that this flattening of the head has something in it of aristocratical significancy, like the crippling of the feet among Chinese ladies of quality. At any rate, it is a sign of freedom. No slave is permitted to bestow this enviable deformity upon his child ; all the slaves, therefore. are roundheads. With this worthy tribe of Chinooks the two partners passed a part of a day very agreeably. M'Dougal, who was some- what vain of his official rank, had given it to be understood that they were two chiefs of a great trading company, about to be established here, and the quicksighted, though one-eyed chief, who was somewhat practiced in traffic with white men, immediately perceived the policy of cultivating the friendship of two such important visiters. He regaled them, therefore, to the best of his ability, with abundance of salmon and wap- patoo. The next morning, March 7th, they prepared to return to the vessel, according to promise. They had eleven miles of open bay to traverse ; the wind was fresh, the waves ran high. Comcomly remonstrated with them on the hazard to which they would be exposed. They were resolute, however, and launched their boat, while the wary chieftain followed at some short distance in his canoe. Scarce had they rowed a mile, when a wave broke over their boat and upset it. They were in imminent peril of drowning, especially Mr. M'Dougal, who could not swim. Comcomly, however, came bounding over the waves in his light canoe, and snatched them from a watery grave."], [103, "COMCOMLY*'s DAUGHTER HER CONQUEST. 95 They were taken on shore and a fire made, at which they dried their clothes, after which Comcomly conducted them back to his village. Here every thing was done that could be devised for their entertainment during three days that they were detained by bad weather. Comcomly made his people perform antics before them ; and his wives and daughters endeavored, by all the soothing and endearing arts of women, to find favor in their eyes. Some even painted their bodies with red clay, and anointed themselves with fish oil, to give additional lustre to their charms. Mr. M'Dougal seems to have had a heart susceptible to the influence of the gentler sex. Whether or no it was first touched on this occasion we do not learn ; but it will be found, in the course of this work, that one of the daughters of the hospitable Comcomly event ually made a conquest of the great eri of the American Fur Company. When the weather had moderated and the sea become tran quil, the one-eyed chief of the Chinooks manned his state canoe, and conducted his guests in safety to the ship, where they were welcomed with joy, for apprehensions had been felt for their safety. Comcomly and his people were then enter tained on board of the Tonquin, and liberally rewarded for their hospitality and services. They returned home highly satisfied, promising to remain faithful friends and allies of the white men."], [104, "96 POINT GEORGE. CHAPTER IX.

These gentlemen, it is true, were not perfectly satisfied with the place, and were desirous of continuing their search ; but Captain Thorn was impatient to land his cargo and continue his voyage, and protested against any more of what he termed \" sporting excursions.\" Accordingly, on the 12th of April the launch was freighted with all things necessary for the purpose, and sixteen persons departed in her to commence the establishment, leaving the Tonquin to follow as soon as the harbor could be sounded. Crossing the wide mouth of the river, the party landed, and encamped at the bottom of a small bay within point George. The situation chosen for the fortified post was on an elevation facing to the north, with the wide estuary, its sand bars, and tumultuous breakers spread out before it, and the promontory of cape Disappointment, fifteen miles distant, closing the prospect to the left. The surrounding country was in all the freshness of spring ; the trees were in the young leaf, the weather was superb, and every thing looked delightful to men just emancipated from a long confinement on shipboard.

Tonquin shortly afterwards made her way through the intri cate channel, and came to anchor in the little bay, and was saluted from the encampment with three vollies of musketry and three cheers. She returned the salute with three cheers and three guns. All hands now set to work cutting down trees, clearing away thickets, and marking out the place for the residence, storehouse, and powder magazine, which were to be built of logs and covered with bark. Others landed the timbers intended for the frame of the coasting vessel, and proceeded to put them together; while others prepared a garden spot, and sowed the seeds of various vegetables.

The neighboring Indians now swarmed about the place Some brought a few land-otter and sea-otter skins to barter. but in very scanty parcels ; the greater number came prying about to gratify their curiosity, for they are said to be imperti nently inquisitive ; while not a few came with no other design than to pilfer ; the laws of meum and tuum being but slightly respected among them. Some of them beset the ship in their canoes, among whom was the Chinook chief Comcomly, and his liege subjects. These were well received by Mr. M'Dou gal, who was delighted with an opportunity of entering upon his functions and acquiring importance in the eyes of his future neighbors. The confusion thus produced on board, and the derangement of the cargo caused by this petty trade, stirred the spleen of the captain, who had a sovereign con tempt for the one-eyed chieftain and all his crew. He com- plained loudly of having his ship lumbered by a host of 9"], [106, "98 SAILING OF THE TONQUIN. \" Indian ragamuffins,\" who had not a skin to dispose of, and at length put his positive interdict upon all trafficking on board. Upon this Mr. M'Dougal was fain to land, and estab lish his quarters at the encampment, where be could exercise his rights and enjoy his dignities without control. The feud, however, between these rival powers still con tinued, but was chiefly carried on by letter. Day after day, and week after week elapsed, yet the storehouses requisite for the reception of the cargo were not completed, and the ship was detained in port ; while the captain was teased by frequent requisitions for various articles for the use of the establisl ment, or the trade with the natives. An angry cor respondence took place, in which he complained bitterly of the time wasted in \" smoking and sporting parties,\" as he termed the reconnoitring expeditions, and in clearing and preparing meadow ground and turnip patches, instead of dis patching his ship. At length all these jarring matters were adjusted, if not to the satisfaction, at least to the acquiescence of all parties. The part of the cargo destined for the use of Astoria was landed, and the ship left free to proceed on her voyage. As the Tonquin was to coast to the north, to trade for pel tries at the different harbors, and to touch at Astoria on her return in the autumn, it was unanimously determined that Mr. M'Kay should go in her as supercargo, taking with him Mr. Lewis as ship's clerk. On the first of June the ship got under way, and dropped down to Baker's bay, where she was detained for a few days by a head wind ; but early in the morning of the fifth stood out to sea with a fine breeze and swelling canvass, and swept off gayly on her fatal voyage, from which she was never to return ! On reviewing the conduct of Captain Thorn, and examining"], [107, "99 REVIEW OF THE CONDUCT OF CAPTAIN THORN. his peevish and somewhat whimsical correspondence, the impression left upon our mind is, upon the whole, decidedly in his favor. While we smile at the simplicity of his heart and the narrowness of his views, which made him regard every thing out of the direct path of his daily duty, and the rigid exigencies of the service, as trivial and impertinent, which inspired him with contempt for the swelling vanity of some of his coadjutors, and the literary exercises and curious researches of others, we cannot but applaud that strict and conscientious devotion to the interests of his employer, and to what he considered the true objects of the enterprise in which he was engaged. He certainly was to blame occasion ally for the asperijy of his manners, and the arbitrary nature of his measures, yet much that is exceptionable in this part of his conduct may be traced to rigid notions of duty, acquired in that tyrannical school, a ship of war, and to the construc tion given by his companions to the orders of Mr. Astor, so little in conformity with his own. His mind, too, appears to have become almost diseased by the suspicions he had formed as to the loyalty of his associates, and the nature of their ulti mate designs ; yet on this point there were circumstances to, in some measure, justify him. The relations between the United States and Great Britain were at that time in a critical state ; in fact, the two countries were on the eve of a war. Several of the partners were British subjects, and might be ready to desert the flag under which they acted, should a war take place. Their application to the British minister at New York shows the dubious feeling with which they had embarked in the present enterprise. They had been in the employ of the North-west Company, and might be disposed to rally again under that association, should events threaten the prosperity of this embryo establishment of Mr. Astor. Beside, we have"], [108, "100 HIS OPINION OF M'DOUGAL. the fact, averred to us by one of the partners, that some of them, who were young and heedless, took a mischievous and unwarrantable pleasure in playing upon the jealous temper of the captain, and affecting mysterious consultations and sinister movements.

That most of the partners were perfectly upright and faithful in the discharge of the trust reposed in them we are fully satisfied ; still the honest captain was not invariably wrong in his suspicions ; and that he formed a pretty just opinion of the integrity of that aspiring personage, Mr. M'Dougal, will be substantially proven in the tiequel."], [109, "ALARMS FROM THE INTERIOR. 101 CHAPTER X.

While the Astorians were busily occupied in completing their factory and fort, a report was brought to them by an Indian from the upper part of the river, that a party of thirty white men had appeared on the banks of the Columbia, and were actually building houses at the second rapids. This informa tion caused much disquiet. We have already mentioned that the North-west Company had established posts to the west of the Rocky mountains, in a district called by them New Cale donia, which extended from lat. 52\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 north, being within the British territories. It was now apprehended that they were advancing within the American limits, and were endeav oring to seize upon the upper part of the river and forestall the American Fur Company in the surrounding trade ; in which case bloody feuds might be anticipated, such as had prevailed between the rival fur companies in former days. A reconnoitring party was sent up the river to ascertain the truth of the report. They ascended to the foot of the first 9*"], [110, "102 ALARMS FROM THE INTERIOR rapid, about two hundred miles, but could hear nothing of any white men being in the neighborhood. Not long after their return, however, further accounts were received, by two wandering Indians, which established the fact, that the North-west Company had actually erected a trading house on the Spokan river, which falls into the north branch cf the Columbia. What rendered this intelligence the more disquieting, was the inability of the Astorians, in their present reduced state as to numbers, and the exigencies of their new establishment, to furnish detachments to penetrate the country in different directions, and fix the posts necessary to secure the interior trade. It was resolved, however, at any rate, to advance a counter check to this post on the Spokan, and one of the partners, Mr. David Stuart, prepared to set out for the purpose with eight men and a small assortment of goods. He was to be guided by the two Indians, who knew the country, and promised to take him to a place not far from the Spokan river, and in a neighborhood abounding with beaver. Here he was to estab lish himself and to remain for a time, provided he found the situation advantageous and the natives friendly. On the 15th of July, when Mr. Stuart was nearly ready to embark, a canoe made its appearance, standing for the harbor, and manned by nine white men. Much speculation took place who these strangers could be, for it was too soon to expect their own people, under Mr. Hunt, who were to cross the con tinent. As the canoe drew near, the British standard was distinguished : on coming to land, one of the crew stepped on shore, and announced himself as Mr. David Thompson, astronomer, and partner of the North-west Company. Accord? ing to his account, he had set out in the preceding year with"], [111, "103 A SPY IN THE CAMP. a tolerably strong party, and a supply of Indian goods, to cross the Rocky mountains. A part of his people, however, had deserted him on the eastern side, and returned with the goods to the nearest north-west post. He had persisted in crossing the mountains with eight men, who remained true to him. They had traversed the higher regions, and ventured near the source of the Columbia, where, in the spring, they had con structed a cedar canoe, the same in which they had reached Astoria. , This, in fact, was the party dispatched by the North-west Company to anticipate Mr. Astor in his intention of effecting a settlement at the mouth of the Columbia river. It appears, from information subsequently derived from other sources, that Mr. Thompson had pushed on his course with great haste, calling at all the Indian villages in his march, presenting them with British flags, and even planting them at the forks of the rivers, proclaiming formally that he took possession of the country in the name of the king of Great Britain for the North-west Company. As his original plan was defeated by the desertion of his people, it is probable that he descended the river simply to reconnoitre, and ascertain whether an American settlement had been commenced. Mr. Thompson was, no doubt, the first white man who descended the northern branch of the Columbia from so near its source. Lewis and Clarke struck the main body of the river at the forks, about four hundred miles from its mouth. They entered it from Lewis river, its southern branch, and thence descended. Though Mr. Thompson could be considered as little better than a spy in the camp, he was received with great cordiality by Mr. M'Dougal, who had a lurking feeling of companionship and good will for all of the North-west Company. He invited"], [112, "104 EXPEDITION INTO THE INTERIOR. him to head quarters, where he and his people were hospita bly entertained. Nay, further, being somewhat in extremity, he was furnished by Mr. M'Dougal with goods and provisions for his journey back, across the mountains, much against the wishes of Mr. David Stuart, who did not think the object of his visit entitled him to any favor. On the 23d of July, Mr. Stuart set out upon his expedition to the interior. His party consisted of four of the clerks, Messrs. Pillet, Ross, M'Lennon, and Montigny, two Cana dian voyageurs, and two natives of the Sandwich islands. They had three canoes well laden with provisions, and with goods and necessaries for a trading establishment. Mr. Thompson and his party set out in company with them, it being his intention to proceed direct to Montreal. The partners at Astoria forwarded by him a short letter to Mr. Astor, informing him of their safe arrival at the mouth of the Columbia, and that they had not yet heard of Mr. Hunt. The little squadron of canoes set sail with a favorable breeze, and soon passed Tongue point, a long, high, and rocky promon tory, covered with trees, and stretching far into the river. Opposite to this, on the northern shore, is a deep bay, where the Columbia anchored at the time of the discovery, and which is still called Gray's bay, from the name of her com mander. From hence, the general course of the river, for about seventy miles, was nearly south-east ; varying in breadth according to its bays and indentations, and navigable for ves sels of three hundred tons. The shores were in some places high and rocky, with low marshy islands at their feet, subject to inundation, and covered with willows, poplars, and other trees that love an alluvial soil. Sometimes the mountains receded, and gave place to beautiful plains and noble forests."], [113, "105 MOUNT COFFIN INDIAN SEPULCHRES. While the river margin was richly fringed with trees of deciduous foliage, the rough uplands were crowned by majestic pines, and firs of gigantic size, some towering to the height of between two and three hundred feet, with proportionate circumference. Out of these the Indians wrought their great canoes and pirogues. At one part of the river, they passed, on the northern side, an isolated rock, about one hundred and fifty feet high, rising from a low marshy soil, and totally disconnected with the adja cent mountains. This was held in great reverence by the neighboring Indians, being one of their principal places of sepulture. The same provident care for the deceased that prevails among the hunting tribes of the prairies is observable among the piscatory tribes of the rivers and seacoast. Among the former, the favorite horse of the hunter is buried with him in the same funereal mound, and his bow and arrows are laid by his side, that he may be perfectly equipped for the \" happy hunting grounds\" of the land of spirits. Among the latter, the Indian is wrapped in his mantle of skins, laid in his canoe, with his paddle, his fishing spear, and other implements beside him, and placed aloft on some rock or eminence overlooking the river, or bay, or lake, that he has frequented. He is thus fitted out to launch away upon those placid streams and sunny lakes stocked with all kinds of fish and waterfowl, which are, prepared in the next world for those who have acquitted them selves as good sons, good fathers, good husbands, and, above all, good fishermen, during their mortal sojourn. The isolated rock in question presented a spectacle of the kind, numerous dead bodies being deposited in canoes on its summit ; while on poles around were trophies, or rather, fune real offerings of trinkets, garments, baskets of roots, and other articles for the use of the deceased. A reverential feeling"], [114, "106 THE COLUMBIAN VALLEY. protects these sacred spots from robbery or insult. The friends of the deceased, especially the women, repair here at sunrise and sunset for some time after his death, singing his funeral dirge, and uttering loud wailings and lamentations. From the number of dead bodies in canoes observed upon this rock by the first explorers of the river, it received the name of mount Coffin, which it continues to bear. Beyond this rock they passed the mouth of a river on the right bank of the Columbia, which appeared to take its rise in a distant mountain, covered with snow. The Indian name of this river was the Cowdeskee. Some miles further on they came to the great Columbian valley, so called by Lewis and Clarke. It is sixty miles in width, and extends far to the south-southeast, between parallel ridges of mountains, which bound it on the east and west. Through the centre of this valley flowed a large and beautiful stream, called the Wal lamot,* which came wandering, for several hundred miles, through a yet unexplored wilderness. The sheltered situation of this immense valley had an obvious effect upon the climate. It was a region of great beauty and luxuriance, with lakes and pools, and green meadows shaded by noble groves. Various tribes were said to reside in this valley, and along the banks of the Wallamot. About eight miles above the mouth of the Wallamot the little squadron arrived at Vancouver's point, so called in honor of that celebrated voyager by his lieutenant (Broughton) when he explored the river. This point is said to present one of the most beautiful scenes on the Columbia ; a lovely meadow, with a silver sheet of limpid water in the centre, enlivened by wild fowl, a range of hills crowned by forests, while the pros- * Pronounced Wallamot, the accent being upon the second syllable."], [115, "107 SCENERY OF THE COLUMBIA. pect is closed by mount Hood, a magnificent mountain rising into a lofty peak, and covered with snow ; the ultimate land mark of the first explorers of the river. Point Vancouver is about one hundred miles from Astoria. Here the reflux of the tide ceases to be perceptible. To this place vessels of two and three hundred tons burthen may ascend. The party under the command of Mr. Stuart had been three or four days in reaching it, though we have for borne to notice their daily progress and nightly encampments. From point Vancouver the river turned towards the north east, and became more contracted and rapid, with occasional islands and frequent sand banks. These islands are furnished with a number of ponds, and at certain seasons abound with swan, geese, brandts, cranes, gulls, plover, and other wild fowl. The shores, too, are low, and closely wooded, with such an undergrowth of vines and rushes as to be almost impassable. About thirty miles above point Vancouver the mountains again approach on both sides of the river, which is bordered by stupendous precipices, covered with the fir and the white cedar, and enlivened occasionally by beautiful cascades leap ing from a great height, and sending up wreaths of vapor. One of these precipices, or cliffs, is curiously worn by time and weather so as to have the appearance of a ruined fortress, with towers and battlements, beetling high above the river ; while two small cascades, one hundred and fifty feet in height, pitch down from the fissures of the rocks. The turbulence and rapidity of the current continually aug menting as they advanced, gave the voyagers intimation that they were approaching the great obstructions of the river, and at length they arrived at Strawberry island, so called by Lewis and Clarke, which lies at the foot of the first rapid. As this part of the Columbia will be repeatedly mentioned in the"], [116, "108 FALLS AND RAPIDS. course of this work, being the scene of some of its incidents, we shall give a general description of it in this place. The falls or rapids of the Columbia are situated about one hundred and eighty miles above the mouth of the river. The first is a perpendicular cascade of twenty feet, after which there is a swift descent for a mile, between islands of hard black rock, to another pitch of eight feet divided by two rocks. About two and a half miles below this the river expands into a wide basin, seemingly dammed up by a perpendicular ridge of black rock. A current, however, sets diagonally to the left of this rocky barrier, where there is a chasm forty-five yards in width. Through this the whole body of the river roars along, swelling and whirling and boiling for some distance in the wildest confusion. Through this tremendous channel the intrepid explorers of the river, Lewis and Clarke, passed safely in their boats ; the danger being, not from the rocks, but from the great surges and whirlpools. At the distance of a mile and a half from the foot of this narrow channel is a rapid, formed by two rocky islands ; and two miles beyond is a second great fall, over a ledge of rocks twenty feet high, extending nearly from shore to shore. The river is again compressed into a channel from fifty to a hun dred feet wide, worn through a rough .bed of hard black rock, along which it boils and roars with great fury for the distance of three miles. This is called \" The Long Narrows.\" Here is the great fishing place of the Columbia. In the spring of the year, when the water is high, the salmon ascend the river in incredible numbers. As they pass through this narrow strait, the Indians, standing on the rocks, or on the end of wooden stages projecting from the banks, scoop them up with small nets distended on hoops and attached to long handles, and cast them on the shore."], [117, "109 AN INDIAN FISHING MART. They are then cured and packed in a peculiar manner. After having been opened and disembowelled, they are ex posed to the sun on scaffolds erected on the river banks. When sufficiently dry, they are pounded fine between two stones, pressed into the smallest compass, and packed in baskets or bales of grass matting, about two feet long and one in diameter, lined with the cured skin of a salmon. The top is likewise covered with fish skins, secured by cords passing through holes in the edge of the basket. Packages are then made, each containing twelve of these bales, seven at bottom, five at top, pressed close to each other, with the corded side upward, wrapped in mats and corded. These are placed in dry situations, and again covered with matting. Each of theso packages contains from ninety to a hundred pounds of dried fish, which in this state will keep sound for several years.* We have given this process at some length, as furnished by the first explorers, because it marks a practised ingenuity in preparing articles of traffic for a market, seldom seen among our aboriginals. For like reasons we would make especial mention of the village of Wish-ram, at the head of the Long Narrows, as being a solitary instance of an aboriginal trading mart, or emporium. Here the salmon caught in the neighbor ing rapids were \" warehoused,\" to await customers. Hither the tribes from the mouth of the Columbia repaired with the fish of the seacoast, the roots, berries, and especially the wappatoo, gathered in the lower parts of the river, together with goods and trinkets obtained from the ships which casu ally visited the coast. Hither also the tribes from the Rocky mountains brought down horses, bear grass, quamash, and other commodities of the interior. The merchant fishermen at the * Lewis and Clarke, vol. ii. p. 32. 10"], [118, "110 WISH-RAM AND ITS INHABITANTS. falls acted as middlemen or factors, and passed the objects of traffic, as it were, cross-handed ; trading away part of the wares received from the mountain tribes to those of the river and the plains, and vice versa : their packages of pounded sal mon entered largely into the system of barter, and being carried off in opposite directions, found their way to the sav age hunting camps far in the interior, and to the casual white traders who touched upon the coast. We have already noticed certain contrarieties of character between the Indian tribes, produced by their diet and mode of life ; and nowhere are they more apparent than about the falls of the Columbia. The Indians of this great fishing mart are represented by the earliest explorers as sleeker and fatter, but less hardy and active, than the tribes of the mountains and the prairies, who live by hunting, or of the upper parts of the river, where fish is scanty, and the inhabitants must eke out their subsistence by digging roots or chasing the deer. Indeed, whenever an Indian of the upper country is too lazy to hunt, yet is fond of good living, he repairs to the falls, to live in abundance without labor. \" By such worthless dogs as these,\" says an honest trader in his journal, which now lies before us, \" by such worthless dogs as these are these noted fishing places peopled, which, like our great cities, may with propriety be called the head quarters of vitiated principles.\" The habits of trade and the avidity of gain have their cor rupting effects even in the wilderness, as may be instanced in the members of this aboriginal emporium ; for the same jour nalist denounces them as \" saucy, impudent rascals, who will steal when they can, and pillage whenever a weak party falls in their power.\" That he does not belie them will be evidenced hereafter,"], [119, "111 MOUTH OF THE OAKINAGAN. when we have occasion again to touch at Wish-ram and navi gate the rapids. In the present instance the travellers effected the laborious ascent of this part of the river, with all its various portages, without molestation, and once more launched away in smooth water above the high falls. The two parties continued together, without material imped iment, for three or four hundred miles further up the Columbia; Mr. Thompson appearing to take great interest in the success of Mr. Stuart, and pointing out places favorable, as he said, to the establishment of his contemplated trading post. Mr. Stuart, who distrusted his sincerity, at length pretended to adopt his advice, and, taking leave of him, remained as if to establish himself, while the other proceeded on his course towards the mountains. No sooner, however, had he fairly departed, than Mr. Stuart again pushed forward, under gui dance of the two Indians, nor did he stop until he had arrived within about one hundred and forty miles of the Spokan river, which he considered near enough to keep the rival establish ment in check. The place which he pitched upon for his trading post was a point of land about three miles in length and two in breadth, formed by the junction of the Oakinagan with the Columbia. The former is a river which has its source in a considerable lake about a hundred and fifty miles west of the point of junc tion. The two rivers, about the place of their confluence, are bordered by immense prairies covered with herbage, but desti tute of trees. The point itself was ornamented with wild flowers of every hue, in which innumerable hummingbirds were \" banqueting nearly the livelong day.\" The situation of this point appeared to be well adapted for a trading post. The climate was salubrious, the soil fertile, the rivers well stocked with fish, the natives peaceable and"], [120, "112 A NEW TRADING POST. friendly. There were easy communications with the interior by the upper waters of the Columbia and the lateral stream of the Oakinagan, while the downward current of the Colum bia furnished a highway to Astoria. Availing himself, therefore, of the driftwood which had col lected in quantities in the neighboring bends of the river, Mr. Stuart and his men set to work to erect a house, which in a little while was sufficiently completed for their residence ; and thus was established the first interior post of the company. We will now return to notice the progress of affairs at the mouth of the Columbia."], [121, "ALARM AT ASTORIA. 113 CHAPTER XI. Alarm at Astoria \u2014 rumor of Indian hostilities \u2014 preparations for defence tragical fate of the tonquin. The sailing of the Tonquin, and the departure of Mr. David Stuart and his detachment, had produced a striking effect on affairs at Astoria. The natives who had swarmed about the place began immediately to drop off, until at length not an Indian was to be seen. This, at first, was attributed to the want of peltries with which to trade ; but in a little while the mystery was explained in a more alarming manner. A con spiracy was said to be on foot among the neighboring tribes to make a combined attack upon the white men, now that they were so reduced in number. For this purpose there had been a gathering of warriors in a neighboring bay, under pretext of fishing for sturgeon ; and fleets of canoes were expected to join them from the north and south. Even Comcomly, the one-eyed chief, notwithstanding his professed friendship for Mr. M'Dougal, was strongly suspected of being concerned in this general combination. Alarmed at rumors of this impending danger, the Astorians suspended their regular labor, and set to work, with all haste, to throw up temporary works for refuge and defence. In the course of a few days they surrounded their dwelling-house and magazines with a picket fence ninety feet square, flanked by two bastions, on which were mounted four four-pounders. 10*"], [122, "114 ALARMING RUMORS. Every day they exercised themselves in the use of their weapons, so as to qualify themselves for military duty, and at night they ensconced themselves in their fortress and posted sentinels, to guard against surprise. In this way they hoped, even in case of attack, to be able to hold out until the arrival of the party to be conducted by Mr. Hunt across the Rocky mountains, or until the return of the Tonquin. The latter dependance, however, was doomed soon to be destroyed. Early in August, a wandering band of savages from the strait of Juan de Fuca, made their appearance at the mouth of the Columbia, where they came to fish for sturgeon. They brought disastrous accounts of the Tonquin, which were at first treated as mere sables, but which were too sadly con firmed by a different tribe that arrived a few days subsequently. We shall relate the circumstances of this melancholy affair as correctly as the casual discrepancies in the statements that have reached us will permit. We have already stated that the Tonquin set sail from the mouth of the river on the fifth of June. The whole number of persons on board amounted to twenty-three. In one of the outer bays they picked up, from a fishing canoe, an Indian named Lamazee, who had already made two voyages along the coast, and knew something of the languages of the various tribes. He agreed to accompany them as interpreter. Steering to the north, Captain Thorn arrived in a few days at Vancouver's island, and anchored in the harbor of Neweetee. very much against the advice of his Indian interpreter, who warned him against the perfidious character of the natives of this part of the coast. Numbers of canoes soon came off, bringing sea-otter skins to sell. It was too late in the day to commence a traffic, but Mr. M'Kay, accompanied by a few of the men, went on shore to a large village to visit Wicananish,"], [123, "A SHREWD INDIAN TRADER. 115 the chief of the surrounding territory, six of the natives remaining on board as hostages. He was received with great professions of friendship, entertained hospitably, and a couch of sea-otter skins was prepared for him in the dwell ing of the chieftain, where he was prevailed upon to pass the night. In the morning, before Mr. M'Kay had returned to the ship, great numbers of the natives came off in their canoes to trade, headed by two sons of Wicananish. As they brought abun dance of sea-otter skins, and there was every appearance of a brisk trade, Captain Thorn did not wait for the return of Mr. M'Kay, but spread out his wares upon the deck, making a tempting display of blankets, cloths, knives, beads, and fish hooks, expecting a prompt and profitable sale. The Indians, however, were not so eager and simple as he had supposed, having learned the art of bargaining and the value of merchan dise from the casual traders along the coast. They were guided, too, by a shrewd old chief named Nookamis, who had grown gray in traffic with New England skippers, and prided himself upon his acuteness. His opinion seemed to regulate the market. When Captain Thorn made what he considered a liberal offer for an otter skin, the wily old Indian treated it with scorn, and asked more than double. His comrades all took their cue from him, and not an otter skin was to be had at a reasonable rate. The old fellow, however, overshot his mark, and mistook the character of the man he was treating with. Thorn was a plain, straight-forward sailor, who never had two minds nor two prices in his dealings, was deficient in patience and pli ancy, and totally wanting in the chicanery of traffic. He had a vast deal of stern, but honest pride in his nature, and, more over, held the whole savage race in sovereign contempt."], [124, "116 A DEADLY INSULT. Abandoning all further attempts, therefore, to bargain with his shuffling customers, he thrust his hands into his pockets, and paced up and down the deck in sullen silence. The cunning old Indian followed him to and fro, holding out a sea-otter skin to him at every turn, and pestering him to trade. Finding other means unavailing, he suddenly changed his tone, and began to jeer and banter him upon the mean prices he offered. This was too much for the patience of the captain, who was never remarkable for relishing a joke, especially when at his own expense. Turning suddenly upon his persecutor, he snatched the proffered otter skin from his hands, rubbed it in his face, and dismissed him over the side of the ship with no very complimentary application to accelerate his exit. He then kicked the peltries to the right and left about the deck, and broke up the market in the most ignominious manner. Old Nookamis made for shore in a furious passion, in which he was joined by Shewish, one of the sons of Wicananish, who went off breathing vengeance, and the ship was soon abandoned by the natives. When Mr. M'Kay returned on board, the interpreter related what had passed, and begged him to prevail upon the captain to make sail, as, from his knowledge of the temper and pride of the people of the place, he was sure they would resent the indignity offered to one of their chiefs. Mr. M'Kay, who himself possessed some experience of Indian character, went to the captain, who was still pacing the deck in moody humor, represented the danger to which his hasty act had exposed the vessel, and urged him to weigh anchor. The captain made light of his councils, and pointed to his cannon and fire arms as a sufficient safeguard against naked savages. Further remonstrances only provoked taunting replies and sharp alter cations. The day passed away without any signs of hostility,"], [125, "DANGEROUS VISITERS. 117 and at night the captain retired as usual to his cabin, taking no more than the usual precautions. On the following morning, at daybreak, while the captain and Mr. M'Kay were yet asleep, a canoe came alongside in which were twenty Indians, commanded by young Shewish. They were unarmed, their aspect and demeanor friendly, and they held up otter skins, and made signs indicative of a wish to trade. The caution enjoined by Mr. Astor, in respect to the admission of Indians on board of the ship, had been neglected for some time past ; and the officer of the watch, perceiving those in the canoe to be without weapons, and having received no orders to the contrary, readily permitted them to mount the deck. Another canoe soon succeeded, the crew of which was likewise admitted. In a little while other canoes came off, and Indians w*ere soon clambering into the vessel on all sides. The officer of the watch now felt alarmed, and called to Captain Thorn and Mr. M'Kay. By the time they came on deck, it was thronged with Indians. The interpreter noticed to Mr. M'Kay that many of the natives wore short mantles of skins, and intimated a suspicion that they were secretly armed. Mr. M'Kay urged the captain to clear the ship and get under way. He again made light of the advice ; but the augmented swarm of canoes about the ship, and the numbers still putting off from shore, at length awakened his distrust, and he ordered some of the crew to weigh anchor, while some were sent aloft to make sail. The Indians now offered to trade with the captain on his own terms, prompted, apparently, by the approaching depart ure of the ship. Accordingly, a hurried trade was commenced. The main articles sought by the savages in barter, were knives ; as fast as some were supplied they moved off, and"], [126, "118 AN OUTBREAK, others succeeded. By degrees they were thus distributed about the deck, and all with weapons. The anchor was now nearly up, the sails were loose, and the captain, in a loud and peremptory tone, ordered the ship to be cleared. In an instant a signal yell was given : it was echoed on every side, knives and war-clubs were brandished in every direction, and the savages rushed upon their marked victims. The first that fell was Mr. Lewis, the ship's clerk. He was leaning, with folded arms, over a bale of blankets, engaged in bargaining, when he received a deadly stab in the back, and fell down the companionway. Mr. M'Kay, who was seated on the taffrail, sprang on his feet, but was instantly knocked down with a war-club and flung* backwards into the sea, where he was dispatched by the women in the canoes. In the meantime, Captain Thorn made desperate fight against fearful odds. He was a powerful as well as resolute man, but he had come upon deck without weapons. Shewish, the young chief, singled him out as his peculiar prey, and rushed upon him at the first outbreak. The captain had barely time to draw a claspknife, with one blow of which he laid the young savage dead at his feet. Several of the stoutest followers of Shewish now set upon him. He defended him self vigorously, dealing crippling blows to right and left, and strewing the quarterdeck with the slain and wounded. His object was, to fight his way to the cabin, where there were fire-arms ; but he was hemmed in with foes, covered with wounds, and faint with loss of blood. For an instant he leaned upon the tiller wheel, when a blow from behind, with a war-club, felled him to the deck, where he was dispatched with knives and thrown overboard."], [127, "119 A CHANCE MEDLEY AFFRAY. While this was transacting upon the quarterdeck, a chance medley fight was going on throughout the ship. The crew fought desperately with knives, handspikes, and whatever weapon they could seize upon in the moment of surprise. They were soon, however, overpowered by numbers, and mer cilessly butchered. As to the seven who had been sent aloft to make sail, they contemplated with horror the carnage that was going on below. Being destitute of weapons, they let themselves down by the running rigging, in hopes of getting between decks. One fell in the attempt, and was instantly dispatched ; another received a death blow in the back as he was descending ; a third, Ste phen Weekes, the armorer, was mortally wounded as he was getting down the hatchway. The remaining four made good their retreat into the cabin, where they found Mr. Lewis, still alive, though mortally wound ed. Barricading the cabin door, they broke holes through the companionway, and, with the muskets and ammunition which were at hand, opened a brisk fire that soon cleared the deck. Thus far the Indian interpreter, from whom these particulars are derived, had been an eyewitness of the deadly conflict. He had taken no part in it, and had been spared by the natives as being of their race. In the confusion of the moment he took refuge with the rest, in the canoes. The survivors of the crew now sallied forth, and discharged some of the deck guns, which did great execution among the canoes, and drove all the savages to shore. For the remainder of the day no one ventured to put off to the ship, deterred by the effects of the fire-arms. The night passed away without any further attempt on the part of the natives. When the day dawned, the Tonquin still lay at anchor in the bay, her sails all loose and flapping in the wind."], [128, "120 AN EXPLOSION. and no one apparently on board of her. Aster a time, some of the canoes ventured forth to reconnoitre, taking with them the interpreter. They paddled about her, keeping cautiously at a distance, but growing more and more emboldened at seeing her quiet and lifeless. One man at length made his appearance on the deck, and was recognised by the interpreter as Mr. Lewis. He made friendly signs, and invited them on board. It was long before they ventured to comply. Those who mounted the deck met with no opposition ; no one was to be seen on board ; for Mr. Lewis, after inviting them, had disappeared. Other canoes now pressed forward to board the prize ; the decks were soon crowded, and the sides covered with clambering savages, all intent on plunder. In the midst of their eagerness and exultation, the ship blew up with a tremendous explosion. Arms, legs, and mutilated bodies were blown into the air, and dreadful havoc was made in the sur rounding canoes. The interpreter was in the main chains at the time of the explosion, and was thrown unhurt into the water, where he succeeded in getting into one of the canoes. According to his statement, the bay presented an awful spec tacle after the catastrophe. The ship had disappeared, but the bay was covered with fragments of the wreck, with shat tered canoes, and Indians swimming for their lives, or strug gling in the agonies of death ; while those who had escaped the danger remained aghast and stupified, or made with frantic panic for the shore. Upwards of a hundred savages were destroyed by tbe explosion, many more were shockingly muti lated, and for days afterwards the limbs and bodies of the slain were thrown upon the beach. The inhabitants of Neweetee were overwhelmed with con sternation at this astounding calamity, which had burst upon them in the very moment of triumph. The warriors sat mute"], [129, "121 THE UNFORTUNATE FUGITIVES. and mournful, while the women filled the air with loud lamen tations. Their weeping and wailing, however, was suddenly changed into yells of fury at the sight of four unfortunate white men, brought captive into the village. They had been driven on shore in one of the ship's boats, and taken at some distance along the coast. The interpreter was permitted to converse with them. They proved to be the four brave fellows who had made such des perate defence from the cabin. The interpreter gathered from them some of the particulars already related. They told him further, that, after they had beaten off the enemy, and cleared the ship, Lewis advised that they should slip the cable and endeavor to get to sea. They declined to take his advice, alleging that the wind set too strongly into the bay, and would drive them on shore. They resolved, as soon as it was dark, to put off quietly in the ship's boat, which they would be able to do unperceived, and to coast along back to Astoria. They put their resolution into effect ; but Lewis refused to accom pany them, being disabled by his wound, hopeless of escape, and determined on a terrible revenge. On the voyage out, he had repeatedly expressed a presentiment that he should die by his own hands ; thinking it highly probable that he should be engaged in some contest with the natives, and being resolved, in case of extremity, to commit suicide, rather than be made a prisoner. He now declared his intention to remain on board of the ship until daylight, to decoy as many of the savages on board as .possible, then to set fire to the powder magazine, and terminate his life by a signal act of vengeance. How well he succeeded has been shown. His companions bade him a melancholy adieu, and set off on their precarious expedition They strove with might and main to get out of the bay, but found it impossible to weather a point of land, and were a* 11"], [130, "122 ERRORS OF CAPTAIN THORN. length compelled to take shelter in a small cove, where they hoped to remain concealed until the wind should be more favorable. Exhausted by fatigue and watching, they fell into a sound sleep, and in that state were surprised by the savages. Better had it been for those unfortunate men had they remained with Lewis, and shared his heroic death : as it was, they per ished in a more painful and protracted manner, being sacrificed by the natives to the manes of their friends with all the linger ing tortures of savage cruelty. Some time after their death, the interpreter, who had remained a kind of prisoner at large, effected his escape, and brought the tragical tidings to Astoria. Such is the melancholy story of the Tonquin, and such was the fate of her brave, but headstrong commander, and her adventurous crew. It is a catastrophe that shows the import ance, in all enterprises of moment, to keep in mind the general instructions of the sagacious heads which devise them. Mr. Astor was well aware of the perils to which ships were exposed on this coast from quarrels with the natives, and from perfidious attempts of the latter to surprise and capture them in unguarded moments. He had repeatedly enjoined it upon Captain Thorn, in conversation, and at parting, in his letter of instructions, to be courteous and kind in his dealings with the savages, but by no means to confide in their apparent friend ship, nor to admit more than a few on board of his ship at a time. Had the deportment of Captain Thorn been properly regu lated, the insult so wounding to savage pride would never have been given. Had he enforced the rule to admit but a few at a time, the savages would not have been able to get the mastery. He was too irritable, however, to practise the necessary self-command, and, having been nurtured in a proud"], [131, "CHARACTERISTIC REPLY OF MR. ASTOR. 123 contempt of danger, thought it beneath him to manifest any fear of a crew of unarmed savages. With all his faults and foibles, we cannot but speak of him with esteem, and deplore his untimely fate ; for we remember him well in early life, as a companion in pleasant scenes and joyous hours. When on shore, among his friends, he was a frank, manly, sound-hearted sailor. On board ship he evidently assumed the hardness of deportment and sternness of demeanor which many deem essential to naval service. Throughout the whole of the expedition, however, he showed himself loyal, single-minded, straight-forward, and fearless ; and if the fate of his vessel may be charged to his harshness and imprudence, we should recollect that he paid for his error with his life. The loss of the Tonquin was a grievous blow to the infant establishment of Astoria, and one that threatened to bring after it a train of disasters. The intelligence of it did not reach Mr. Astor until many months afterwards. He felt it in all its force, and was aware that it must cripple, if not entirely defeat, the great scheme of his ambition. In his letters, writ ten at the time, he speaks of it as \" a calamity, the length of which he could not foresee.\" He indulged, however, in no weak and vain lamentation, but sought to devise a prompt and efficient remedy. The very same evening he appeared at the theatre with his usual serenity of countenance. A friend, who knew the disastrous intelligence he had received, expressed his astonishment that he could have calmness of spirit suffi cient for such a scene of light amusement. \" What would you have me do 1\" was his characteristic reply ; \" would you have me stay at home and weep for what I cannot help V"], [132, "124 GLOOM AT ASTORIA. CHAPTER XII. Gloom at Astoria \u2014 an ingenious stratagem \u2014 the smallpox chief \u2014 launching of the Dolly \u2014 an arrival \u2014 a Canadian trapper \u2014 a FREEMAN OF THE FOREST AN IrOQUOIS HUNTER \u2014 -WINTER ON THE Columbia \u2014 festivities of new-year. The tidings of the loss of the Tonquin, and the massacre of her crew, struck dismay into the hearts of the Astorians. They found themselves a mere handful of men, on a savage coast, surrounded by hostile tribes, who would doubtless be incited and encouraged to deeds of violence by the late fearful catastrophe. In this juncture Mr. M'Dougal, we are told, had recourse to a stratagem by which to avail himself of the igno rance and credulity of the savages, and which certainly does credit to his ingenuity. The natives of the coast, and, indeed, of all the regions west of the mountains, had an extreme dread of the small pox ; that terrific scourge having, a few years previously, appeared among them, and almost swept off entire tribes. Its origin and nature were wrapped in mystery, and they con ceived it an evil inflicted upon them by the Great Spirit, or brought among them by the white men. The last idea was seized upon by Mr. M'Dougal. He assembled several of the chieftains whom he believed to be in the conspiracy. When they were all seated around, he informed them that he had heard of the treachery of some of their northern brethren towards the Tonquin, and was determined on vengeance."], [133, "125 THE GREAT SMALLPOX CHIEF. \" The white men among you,\" said he, \" are few in number, it is true, but they are mighty in medicine. See here,\" con tinued he, drawing forth a small bottle and holding it before their eyes, \" in this bottle I hold the smallpox, safely corked up ; I have but to draw the cork, and let loose the pestilence, to sweep man, woman, and child, from the face of the earth !\" The chiefs were struck with horror and alarm. They implored him not to uncork the bottle, since they and all their people were firm friends of the white men, and would always remain so ; but, should the smallpox be once let out, it would run Hke wildsire throughout the country, sweeping off the good as well as the bad ; and surely he would not be so unjust as to punish his friends for crimes committed by his enemies. Mr. M'Dougal pretended to be convinced by their reasoning, and assured them that, so long as the white people should be unmolested, and the conduct of their Indian neighbors friendly and hospitable, the phial of wrath should remain sealed up ; but, on the least act of hostility, the fatal cork should be drawn. From this time, it is added, he was much dreaded by the natives as one who held their fate in his hands, and was called, by way of pre-eminence, \" the Great Smallpox Chief.\" All this while, the labors at the infant settlement went on with unremitting assiduity, and, by the 26th of September, a commodious mansion, spacious enough to accommodate all hands, was completed. It was built of stone and clay, there being no calcarious stone in the neighborhood from which lime for mortar could be procured. The schooner was also finished, and launched, with the accustomed ceremony, on the second of October, and took her station below the fort. She was named the Dolly, and was the first American vessel launched on this coast. 11*"], [134, "126 AN ARRIVAL. On the 5th of October, in the evening, the little community at Astoria was enlivened by the unexpected arrival of a detach ment from Mr. David Stuart's post on the Oakinagan. It consisted of two of the clerks and two of the privates. They brought favorable accounts of the new establishment, but reported that, as Mr. Stuart was apprehensive there might be a difficulty of subsisting his whole party throughout the win ter, he had sent one half back to Astoria, retaining with him only Ross, Montigny, and two others. Such is the hardihood of the Indian trader. In the heart of a savage and unknown country, seven hundred miles from the main body of his fellow adventurers, Stuart had dismissed half of his little number, and was prepared with the residue to brave all the perils of the wilderness, and the rigors of a long and dreary winter. With the return party came a Canadian Creole named Regis Brugiere, and an lroquois hunter, with his wife and two chil dren. As these two personages belong to certain classes which have derived their peculiar characteristics from the fur trade, we deem some few particulars concerning them perti nent to the nature of this work. Brugiere was of a class of beaver trappers and hunters technically called freemen, in the language of the traders. They are generally Canadians by birth, and of French de scent, who have been employed for a term of years by some fur company, but, their term being expired, continue to hunt and trap on their own account, trading with the company like the Indians. Hence they derive their appellation of freemen, to distinguish them from the trappers, who are bound for a number of years, and receive wages, or hunt on shares. Having passed their early youth in the wilderness, sepa rated almost entirely from civilized man, and in frequent inter course with the Indians, they lapse, with a facility common to"], [135, "127 A FREEMAN OF THE FOREST. human nature, into the habitudes of savage life. Though no longer bound by engagements to continue in the interior, they have become so accustomed to the freedom of the forest and the prairie, that they look back with repugnance upon the restraints of civilization. Most of them intermarry with the natives, and, like the latter, have often a plurality of wives. Wanderers of the wilderness, according to the vicissitudes of the seasons, the migrations of animals, and the plenty or scar city of game, they lead a precarious and unsettled existence ; exposed to sun and storm, and all kinds of hardships, until they resemble the Indians in complexion as well as in tastes and habits. From time to time, they bring the peltries they have collected to the trading houses of the company in whose employ they have been brought up. Here they traffic them away for such articles of merchandise or ammunition as they may stand in need of. At the time when Montreal was the great emporium of the fur trader, one of these freemen of the wilderness would suddenly return, after an absence of many years, among his old friends and comrades. He would be greeted as one risen from the dead ; and with the greater wel come, as he returned flush of money. A short time, however, spent in revelry would be sufficient to drain his purse and sate him with civilized life, and he would return with new relish to the unshackled freedom of the forest. Numbers of men of this class were scattered throughout the north-west territories. Some of them retained a little of the thrift and forethought of the civilized man, and became wealthy among their improvident neighbors ; their wealth being chiefly displayed in large bands of horses, which covered the prairies in the vicinity of their abodes. Most of them, however, were prone to assimilate to the red man in their heedlessness of the future."], [136, "128 AN IROQUOIS HUNTER. Such was Regis Brugiere, a freeman and rover of the wil derness. Having been brought up in the service of the North west Company, he had followed in the train of one of its expeditions across the Rocky mountains, and undertaken to trap for the trading post established on the Spokan river. In the course of his hunting excursions he had either accident ally, or designedly, found his way to the post of Mr. Stuart, and been prevailed upon to descend the Columbia, and \" try his luck\" at Astoria. Ignace Shonowane, the lroquois hunter, was a specimen of a different class. He was one of those aboriginals of Canada who had partially conformed to the habits of civilization, and the doctrines of Christianity, under the influence of the French colonists and the Catholic priests ; who seem generally to have been more successful in conciliating, taming, and con verting the savages, than their English and Protestant rivals. These half civilized Indians retained some of the good, and many of the evil qualities of their original stock. They were firstrate hunters, and dexterous in the management of the canoe. They could undergo great privations, and were admi rable for the service of the rivers, lakes, and forests, provided they could be kept sober, and in proper subordination ; but, once inflamed with liquor, to which they were madly addicted, all the dormant passions, inherent in their nature, were prone to break forth, and to hurry them into the most vindictive and bloody acts of violence. Though they generally professed the Roman Catholic reli gion, yet it was mixed, occasionally, with some of their ancient superstitions ; and they retained much of the Indian belief in charms and omens. Numbers of these men were employed by the North-west Company as trappers, hunters, and canoe men, but on lower terms than were allowed to"], [137, "WINTER ON THE COLUMBIA. 129 white men. Ignace Shonowane had, in this way, followed the enterprise of the company to the banks of the Spokan, being, probably, one of the first of his tribe that had traversed the Rocky mountains. Such were some of the motley populace of the wilderness, incident to the fur trade, who were gradually attracted to the new settlement of Astoria. The month of October now began to give indications of approaching winter. Hitherto, the colonists had been well pleased with the climate. The summer had been temperate, the mercury never rising above eighty degrees. Westerly winds had prevailed during the spring and the early part of summer, and been succeeded by fresh breezes from the north west. In the month of October the southerly winds set in, bringing with them frequent rain. The Indians now began to quit the borders of the ocean, and to retire to their winter quarters in the sheltered bosom of the forests, or along the small rivers and brooks. The rainy season, which commences in October, continues, with little intermission, until April; and though the winters are generally mild, the mercury seldom sinking below the freezing point, yet the tempests of wind and rain are terrible. The sun is sometimes obscured for weeks, the brooks swell into roaring torrents, and the country is threatened with a deluge. The departure of the Indians to their winter quarters gradu ally rendered provisions scanty, and obliged the colonists to send out foraging expeditions in the Dolly. Still, the little handful of adventurers kept up their spirits in their lonely fort at Astoria, looking forward to the time when they should be animated and re-enforced by the party under Mr. Hunt, that was to come to them across the Rocky mountains. . The year gradually wore away. The rain, which had"], [138, "130 NEW-YEAR FESTIVITIES. poured down almost incessantly since the first of October, cleared up towards the evening of the 31st of December, and the morning of the first of January ushered in a day of sun shine. The hereditary French holyday spirit of the Canadian voy ageurs is hardly to be depressed by any adversities ; and they can manage to get up a fete in the most squalid sit uations, and under the most untoward circumstances. An extra allowance of rum, and a little flour to make cakes and puddings, constitute a \" regale ;\" and they forget all their toils and troubles in the song and the dance. On the present occasion, the partners endeavored to cele brate the new-year with some effect. At sunrise the drums beat to arms, the colors were hoisted, with three rounds of small arms and three discharges of cannon. The day was devoted to games of agility and strength, and other amuse ments ; and grog was temperately distributed, together with bread, butter, and cheese. The best dinner their circum stances could afford was served up at mid-day. At sunset the colors were lowered, with another discharge of artillery. The night was spent in dancing ; and, though there was a lack of female partners to excite their gallantry, the voyageurs kept up the ball, with true French spirit, until three o'clock in the morning. So passed the new-year festival of 1812 at the infant colony of Astoria."], [139, "131 EXPEDITION BY LAND. CHAPTER XIII. Expedition by land \u2014 Wilson P.

We have followed up the fortunes of the maritime part of this enterprise to the shores of the Pacific, and have conducted the affairs of the embryo establishment to the opening of the new-year ; let us now turn back to the adventurous band to whom was entrusted the land expedition, and who were to make their way to the mouth of the Columbia, up vast rivers, across trackless plains, and over the rugged barriers of the Rocky mountains. The conduct of this expedition, as has been already men tioned, was assigned to Mr. Wilson Price Hunt, of Trenton, New Jersey, one of the partners of the company, who was ultimately to be at the head of the establishment at the mouth of the Columbia. He is represented as a man scrupulously upright and faithful in his dealings, amiable in his disposition, and of most accommodating manners ; and his whole conduct"], [140, "132 DONALD M KENZ1E will be sound in unison with such a character. He was not practically experienced in the Indian trade ; that is to say, he bad never made any expeditions of traffic into the heart of the wilderness, but he had been engaged in commerce at St. Louis, then a frontier settlement on the Mississippi, where the chief branch of his business had consisted in furnishing Indian traders with goods and equipments, ln this way, he had acquired much knowledge of the trade at second hand, and of the various tribes, and the interior country over which it extended. Another of the partners, Mr. Donald M'Kenzie, was asso ciated with Mr. Hunt in the expedition, and excelled on those points in which the other was deficient ; for he had been ten years in the interior, in the service of the North-west Com pany and valued himself on his knowledge of \" woodcraft,\" and the strategy of Indian trade and Indian warfare. He had a frame seasoned to toils and hardships ; a spirit not to be intimidated, and was reputed to be a \" remarkable shot ;\" which of itself, was sufficient to give him renown upon the frontier. Mr. Hunt and his coadjutor repaired, about the latter part of July, 1810, to Montreal, the ancient emporium of the fur trade, where every thing requisite for the expedition could be pro cured. One of the first objects was to recruit a complement of Canadian voyageurs from the disbanded herd usually to be found loitering about the place. A degree of jockeyship, how ever, is required for this service, for a Canadian voyageur is as full of latent tricks and vice as a horse ; and when he makes the greatest external promise, is prone to prove the greatest \"take in.\" Beside, the North-west Company, who maintained a long established control at Montreal, and knew the qualities of every voyageur, secretly interdicted the prime hands from engaging in this new service ; so that, although liberal terms"], [141, "A BARK CANOE CHAPEL OF ST. ANNE. 133 were offered, few presented themselves but such as were not worth having. From these, Mr. Hunt engaged a number sufficient, as he supposed, for present purposes ; and, having laid in a supply of ammunition, provisions, and Indian goods, embarked all on board of one of those great canoes at that time universally used by the fur traders for navigating the intricate and often obstructed rivers. The canoe was between thirty and forty feet long, and several feet in width ; constructed of birch bark, sewed with fibres of the roots of the spruce tree, and daubed with resin of the pine, instead of tar. The cargo was made up in packages, weighing from ninety to one hundred pounds each, for the facility of loading and unloading, and of trans portation at portages. The canoe itself, though capable of sustaining a freight of upwards of four tons, could readily be carried on men's shoulders. Canoes of this size are generally managed by eight or ten men, two of whom are picked vet erans, who receive double wages, and are stationed, one at the bow and the other at the stern, to keep a look out, and to steer. They are termed the foreman and the steersman. The rest, who ply the paddles, are called middle men. When there is a favorable breeze, the canoe is occasionally navigated with a sail. The expedition took its regular departure, as usual, from St. Anne's, near the extremity of the island of Montreal, the great starting place of the traders to the interior. Here stood the ancient chapel of St. Anne, the patroness of the Canadian voyageurs ; where they made confession, and offered up their vows, previous to departing on any hazardous expedition. Tho shrine of the saint was decorated with relics and votive offer ings hung up by these superstitious beings, either to propitiate her favor, or in gratitude for some signal deliverance in th 12"], [142, "134 MICHILIMACKINAC. wilderness. It was the custom, too, of these devout vaga bonds, after leaving the chapel, to have a grand carouse, in honor of the saint and for the prosperity of the voyage. In this part of their devotions, the crew of Mr. Hunt proved them selves by no means deficient. Indeed, he soon discovered that his recruits, enlisted at Montreal, were fit to vie with the ragged regiment of Falstaff. Some were able-bodied, but inexpert ; others were expert, but lazy ; while a third class were expert and willing, but totally worn out, being broken down veterans, incapable of toil. With this inefficient crew he made his way up the Ottawa river, and by the ancient route of the fur traders, along a suc cession of small lakes and rivers, to Michilimackinac. Their progress was slow and tedious. Mr. Hunt was not accustomed to the management of \" voyageurs,\" and he had a crew admi rably disposed to play the old soldier, and balk their work ; and ever ready to come to a halt, land, make a fire, put on the great pot, and smoke, and gossip, and sing by the hour. It was not until the 22d of July that they arrived at Mack inaw, situated on the island of the same name, at the conflu ence of lakes Huron and Michigan. This famous old French trading post continued to be a rallying point for a multifarious and motley population. The inhabitants were amphibious in their habits, most of them being, or having been, voyageurs or canoe men. It was the great place of arrival and departure of the south-west fur trade. Here the Mackinaw Company had established its principal post, from whence it communi cated with the interior and with Montreal. Hence its various traders and trappers set out for their respective destinations about lake Superior and its tributary waters, or for the Missis sippi, the Arkansas, the Missouri, and the other regions of the west. Here, after the absence of a year, or more, they"], [143, "\"MEN OF THE NORTH.\" 135 returned with their peltries, and settled their accounts ; the furs rendered in by them being transmitted, in canoes, from hence to Montreal. Mackinaw was, therefore, for a great part of the year, very scantily peopled ; but at certain seasons the traders arrived from all points, with their crews of voyageurs, and the place swarmed like a hive. Mackinaw, at that time, was a mere village, stretching along a small bay, with a fine broad beach in front of its principal row of houses, and dominated by the old fort, which crowned an impending height. The beach was a kind of public prom enade, where were displayed all the vagaries of a seaport on the arrival of a fleet from a long cruise. Here voyageurs frol icked away their wages, fiddling and dancing in the booths and cabins, buying all kinds of knick-knacks, dressing themselves out finely, and parading up and down, like arrant braggarts and coxcombs. Sometimes they met with rival coxcombs in the young Indians from the opposite shore, who would appear on the beach painted and decorated in fantastic style, and would saunter up and down, to be gazed at and admired, perfectly satisfied that they eclipsed their palefaced competitors. Now and then a chance party of \" North-westers\" appeared at Mackinaw from the rendezvous at fort William. These held themselves up as the chivalry of the fur trade. They were men of iron ; proof against cold weather, hard fare, and perils of all kinds. Some would wear the north-west button, and a formidable dirk, and assume something of a military air. They generally wore feathers in their hats, and affected the \" brave.\" \" Je suis un homme du nord!\" \u2014 \" I am a man of the north,\" one of these swelling fellows would exclaim, sticking his arms akimbo and ruffling by the South-westers ; whom he regarded with great contempt, as men softened by mild cli mates and the luxurious fare of bread and bacon, and whom"], [144, "136 PORK EATERS \u2014 -WARY RECRUITS. he stigmatized with the inglorious name of pork eaters. The superiority assumed by these vainglorious swaggerers was, in general, tacitly admitted. Indeed, some of them had acquired great notoriety for deeds of hardihood and courage ; for the fur trade had its heroes, whose names resounded throughout the wilderness. Such was Mackinaw at the time of which we are treating. It now, doubtless, presents a totally different aspect. The fur companies no longer assemble there ; the navigation of the lakes is carried on by steamboats and various shipping, and the race of traders, and trappers, and voyageurs, and Indian dan dies, have vapored out their brief hour and disappeared. Such changes does the lapse of a handful of years make in this ever changing country. At this place Mr. Hunt remained for some time, to complete uis assortment of Indian goods, and to increase his number of soyageurs, as well as to engage some of a more efficient char acter than those enlisted at Montreal. And now commenced another game of jockeyship. There ivere able and efficient men in abundance at Mackinaw, but fbr several days not one presented himself. If offers were made to any, they were listened to with a shake of the head. Should any one seem inclined to enlist, there were officious idlers and busybodies, of that class who are ever ready to dis suade others from any enterprise in which the)* themselves have no concern. These would pull him by the sleeve, take him on one side, and murmur in his ear, or would suggest difficulties outright. It was objected that the expedition would have to navigate unknown rivers, and pass through howling wildernesses infest ed by savage tribes, who had already cut off the unfortunate voyageurs that had ventured among them. That it was to"], [145, "137 A STOOL PIGEON A DECOY PLUME. climb the Rocky mountains and descend into desolate and famished regions, where the traveller was often obliged to subsist on grasshoppers and crickets, or to kill his own horse for food. At length one man was hardy enough to engage, and he was used like a \" stool pigeon,\" to decoy others ; but several days elapsed before any more could be prevailed upon to join him. A few then came to terms. It was desirable to engage them for five years, but some refused to engage for more than three. Then they must have part of their pay in advance, which was readily granted. When they had pocketed the amount, and squandered it in regales or in outfits, they began to talk of pecuniary obligations at Mackinaw, which must be discharged before they would be free to depart ; or engagements with other persons, which were only to be cancelled by a \" reason able consideration.\" It was in vain to argue or remonstrate. The money advanced had already been sacked and spent, and must be lost and the recruits left behind, unless they could be freed from their debts and engagements. Accordingly, a fine was paid for one ; a judgment for another ; a tavern bill for a third ; and almost all had to be bought off from some prior engagement, either real or pretended. Mr. Hunt groaned in spirit at the incessant and unreason able demands of these worthies upon his purse ; yet with all this outlay of funds, the number recruited was but scanty, and many of the most desirable still held themselves aloof, and were not to be caught by a golden bait. With these he tried another temptation. Among the recruits who had enlisted he distributed feathers and ostrich plumes. These they put in their hats, and thus figured about Mackinaw, assuming airs of vast importance, as \" voyageurs in a new company, that was 12*"], [146, "138 MR. RAMSAY CROOKS. to eclipse the North-west.\" The effect was complete. A French Canadian is too vain and mercurial a being to with stand the finery and ostentation of the feather. Numbers immediately pressed into the service. One must have an ostrich phime ; another, a white feather with a red end ; a third, a bunch of cocks' tails. Thus all paraded about, in vain glorious style, more delighted with the feathers in their hats than with the money in their pockets ; and considering them selves fully equal to the boastful \" men of the north.\" While thus recruiting the number of rank and file, Mr. Hunt was joined by a person whom he had invited, by letter, to engage as a partner in the expedition. This was Mr. Ramsay Crooks, a young man, a native of Scotland, who had served under the North-west Company, and been engaged in trading expeditions upon his individual account, among the tribes of the Missouri. Mr. Hunt knew him personally, and had con ceived a high and merited opinion of his judgment, enterprise, and integrity : he was rejoiced, therefore, when the latter consented to accompany him. Mr. Crooks, however, drew from experience a picture of the dangers to which they would be subjected, and urged the importance of going with a con siderable force. In ascending the upper Missouri they would have to pass through the country of the Sioux Indians, who had manifested repeated hostility to the white traders, and rendered their expeditions extremely perilous ; firing upon them from the river banks as they passed beneath in their boats, and attacking them in their encampments. Mr. Crooks himself, when voyaging in company with another trader of the name of M'Lellan, had been interrupted by these marauders, and had considered himself fortunate in escaping down the river without loss of life or property, but with a total abandon ment of his trading voyage."], [147, "139 EMBARCATION OF CANADIAN VOYAGEURS. Should they be fortunate enough to pass through the country of the Sioux without molestation, they would have another tribe still more savage and warlike beyond, and deadly foes of the white men. These were the Blackfeet Indians, who ranged over a wide extent of country which they would have to traverse. Under all these circumstances, it was thought advisable to augment the party considerably. It already exceeded the number of thirty, to which it had originally been limited ; but it was determined, on arriving at St. Louis, to increase it to the number of sixty. These matters being arranged, they prepared to embark ; but the embarcation of a crew of Canadian voyageurs, on a distant expedition, is not so easy a matter as might be imagined ; especially of such a set of vainglorious fellows with money in both pockets, and cocks' tails in their hats. Like sailors, the Canadian voyageurs generally preface a long cruise with a carouse. They have their cronies, their brothers, their cousins, their wives, their sweethearts ; all to be entertained at their expense. They feast, they fiddle, they drink, they sing, they dance, they frolic and fight, until they are all as mad as so many drunken Indians. The publicans are all obedience to their commands, never hesitating to let them rur. up scores without limit, knowing that, when their own money is expended, the purses of their employers must answer for the bill, or the voyage must be delayed. Neither was it possible, at that time, to remedy the matter at Mackinaw. In that amphibious community there was always a propensity to wrest the laws in favor of riotous or mutinous boatmen. It was necessary, also, to keep the recruits in good-humor, seeing the novelty and danger of the service into which they were entering, and the ease with which they might at any"], [148, "140 PARTINGS OF BOON COMPANIONS. time escape it, by jumping into a canoe and going down the stream. Such were the scenes that beset Mr. Hunt, and gave him a foretaste of the difficulties of his command. The little cabarets and sutlers' shops along the bay resounded with the scraping of fiddles, with snatches of old French songs, with Indian whoops and yelps ; while every plumed and feathered vaga bond had his troop of loving cousins and comrades at his heels. It was with the utmost difficulty they could be extricated from the clutches of the publicans, and the embraces of their pot companions, who followed them to the water's edge with many a hug, a kiss on each cheek, and a maudlin benediction in Canadian French. It was about the 12th of August that they left Mackinaw, and pursued the usual route by Green bay, Fox and Wisconsin rivers, to Prairie du Chien, and thence down the Mississippi to St. Louis, where they landed on the third of September."], [149, "141 ST.

St. Louis, which is situated on the right bank of the Missis sippi river, a few miles below the mouth of the Missouri, was, at that time, a frontier settlement, and the last fitting out place for the Indian trade of the south-west. It possessed a motley population, composed of the Creole descendants of the original French colonists ; the keen traders from the Atlantic states ; the backwoodmen of Kentucky and Tennessee ; the Indians and half-breeds of the prairies ; together with a singular aqua tic race that had grown up from the navigation of the rivers \u2014 the \" boatmen of the Mississippi ;\" who possessed habits, man ners, and almost a language, peculiarly their own, and strongly technical.

The old French houses engaged in the Indian trade had gathered round them a train of dependants, mongrel Indians, and mongrel Frenchmen, who had intermarried with Indians. These they employed in their various expeditions by land and water. Various individuals of other countries had, of late years, pushed the trade further into the interior, to the upper waters of the Missouri, and had swelled the number of these hangers on. Several of these traders had, two or three years previously, formed themselves into a company, composed of twelve partners, with a capital of about forty thousand dollars, called the Missouri Fur Company ; the object of which was, to establish posts along the upper part of that river, and mo nopolize the trade. The leading partner of this company was Mr. Manuel Lisa, a Spaniard by birth, and a man of bold and enterprising character, who had ascended the Missouri almost to its source, and made himself well acquainted and popular with several of its tribes. By his exertions, trading posts had been established, in 1808, in the Sioux country, and among the Aricara and Mandan tribes ; and a principal one. under Mr. Henry, one of the partners, at the forks of the Missouri. This company had in its employ about two hundred and fifty men, partly American hunters, and partly Creoles and Canadian voyageurs. All these circumstances combined to produce a population at St. Louis even still more motley than that at Mackinaw. Here were to be seen, about the river banks, the hectoring, extravagant, bragging boatmen of the Mississippi, with the gay, grimacing, singing, good-humored Canadian voyageurs. Vagrant Indians, of various tribes, loitered about the streets. Now and then, a stark Kentucky hunter, in leathern hunting dress, with rifle on shoulder and knife in belt, strode along. Here and there were new brick houses and shops, just set up"], [151, "143 MR. JOSEPH MILLER. by bustling, driving, and eager men of traffic, from the Atlantic states ; while, on the other hand, the old French mansions, with open casements, still retained the easy, indolent air of the original colonists ; and now and then the scraping of a fiddle, a strain of an ancient French song, or the sound of billiard balls, showed that the happy Gallic turn for gayety and amusement still lingered about the place. Such was St. Louis at the time of Mr. Hunt's arrival there ; and the appearance of a new fur company, with ample funds at its command, produced a strong sensation among the Indian traders of the place, and awakened keen jealousy and opposi tion on the part of the Missouri Company. Mr. Hunt pro ceeded to strengthen himself against all competition. For this purpose, he secured to the interests of the association another of those enterprising men, who had been engaged in individual traffic with the tribes of the Missouri. This was a Mr. Joseph Miller, a gentleman well educated and well inform ed, and of a respectable family of Baltimore. He had been an officer in the army of the United States, but had resigned in disgust, on being refused a furlough, and had taken to trapping beaver and trading among the Indians. He was easily induced by Mr. Hunt to join as a partner, and was considered by him, on account of his education and acquirements, and his expe rience in Indian trade, a valuable addition to the company. Several additional men were likewise enlisted at St. Louis ; some as boatmen, and others as hunters. These last were engaged, not merely to kill game for provisions, but also, and indeed chiefly, to trap beaver and other animals of rich furs, valuable in the trade. They enlisted on different terms. Some were to have a fixed salary of three hundred dollars ; others were to be fitted out and maintained at the expense of the company, and were to hunt and trap on shares."], [152, "144 TEMPERATURE OF THE MISSOURI. As Mr. Hunt met with much opposition on the part of rival traders, especially the Missouri Fur Company, it took him some weeks to complete his preparations. The delays which he had previously experienced at Montreal, Mackinaw, and on the way, added to those at St. Louis, had thrown him much behind his original calculations, so that it would be impossible to effect his voyage up the Missouri in the present year. This river, flowing from high and cold latitudes, and through wide and open plains, exposed to chilling blasts, freezes early. The winter may be dated from the first of November ; there was every prospect, therefore, that it would be closed with ice long before Mr. Hunt could reach its upper waters. To avoid, however, the expense of wintering at St. Louis, he determined to push up the river as far as possible, to some point above the settlements, where game was plenty, and where his whole party could be subsisted by hunting, until the breaking up of the ice in the spring should permit them to resume their voyage. Accordingly, on the twenty-first of October he took his departure from St. Louis. His party was distributed in three boats. One was the barge which he had brought from Mack inaw ; another was of a larger size, such as was formerly used in navigating the Mohawk river, and known by the generic name of the Schenectady barge ; the other was a large keel boat, at that time the grand conveyance on the Mississippi. In this way they set out from St. Louis, in buoyant spirits, and soon arrived at the mouth of the Missouri. This vast river, three thousand miles in length, and which, with its trib utary streams, drains such an immense extent of country, was as yet but casually and imperfectly navigated by the adventur ous bark of the fur trader. A steamboat had never yet stemmed its turbulent current. Sails were but of casual"], [153, "BOAT NAVIGATION. 145 assistance, for it required a strong wind to conquer the force of the stream. The main dependance was on bodily strength and manual dexterity. The boats, in general, had to be pro pelled by oars and setting poles, or drawn by the hand and by grappling hooks from one root or overhanging tree to another ; or towed by the long cordelle, or towing line, where the shores were sufficiently clear of woods and thickets to permit the men to pass along the banks. During this slow and tedious progress the boat would be exposed to frequent danger from floating trees and great masses of drift wood, or to be impaled upon snags and saw yers ; that is to say, sunken trees, presenting a jagged oi pointed end above the surface of the water. As the channel of the river frequently shifted from side to side, according to the bends and sand banks, the boat had, in the same way, to advance in a zigzag course. Often a part of the crew would have to leap into the water at the shallows, and wade along with the towing line, while their comrades on board toilfully assisted with oar and setting pole. Sometimes the boat would seem to be retained motionless, as if spell bound, opposite some point round which the current set with violence, and where the utmost labor scarce effected any visible progress. On these occasions it was that tie merits of the Canadian voyageurs came into full action. Patient of toil, not to be disheartened by impediment* and disappointments, fertile in expedients, and versed in every mode of humoring and con quering the wayward current, they would ply every exertion, sometimes in the boat, sometimes on shore, sometimes in the water, however oold ; always alert, always in good-humor ; and, should they at any time flag or grow weaiy, one of their popular boat songs, chanted by a veteran oarsman, am* responded to in chorus, acted as a never-failing restorative. 13"], [154, "146 A PARTISAN UNDER WAYNE. By such assiduous and persevering labor they made their way about four hundred and fifty miles up the Missouri, by the 16th of November, to the mouth of the Nodowa. As this was a good hunting country, and as the season was rapidly advanc ing, they determined to establish their winter quarters at this place ; and, in fact, two days after they had come to a halt, the river closed just above their encampment. The party had not been long at this place when they were joined by Mr. Robert M'Lellan, another trader of the Missouri; the same who had been associated with Mr. Crooks in the unfortunate expedition in which they had been intercepted by the Sioux Indians, and obliged to make a rapid retreat down the river. M'Lellan was a remarkable man. He had been a partisan under General Wayne in his Indian wars, where he had dis tinguished himself by his fiery spirit and reckless daring, and marvellous stories were told of his exploits. His appearance answered to his character. His frame was meagre, but mus cular ; showing strength, activity, and iron firmness. His eyes were dark, deep set, and piercing. He was restless, fearless, but of impetuous and sometimes ungovernable temper. He had been invited by Mr. Hunt to enrol himself as a part ner, and gladly consented , being pleased with the thoughts of passing, with a powerful force, through the country of the Sioux, and perhaps having an opportunity of revenging himself upon that lawless tribe for their past offences. Another recruit that joined the camp at Nodowa deserves equal mention. This was John Day, a hunter from the back woods of Virginia, but who had been several years on the Missouri in the service of Mr. Crooks, and of other traders. He was about forty years of age, six feet two inches high, straight as an Indian ; with an elastic step as if he trod on"], [155, "147 JOHN DAY, THE VIRGINIAN HUNTER. springs, and a handsome, open, manly countenance. It was his boast that, in his younger days, nothing could hurt or daunt him ; but he had \" lived too fast,\" and injured his constitution by his excesses. Still he was strong of hand, bold cf heart, a prime woodman, and an almost unerring shot. He had the frank spirit of a Virginian, and the rough heroism of a pioneer of the west. The party were now brought to a halt for several months. They were in a country abounding with deer and wild tur keys, so that there was no stint of provisions, and every one appeared cheerful and contented. Mr. Hunt determined to avail himself of this interval to return to St. Louis and obtain a re-enforcement. He wished to procure an interpreter, acquainted with the language of the Sioux ; as, from all accounts, he apprehended difficulties in passing through the country of that nation. He felt the necessity, also, of having a greater number of hunters, not merely to keep up a supply of provisions throughout their long and arduous expedition, but also as a protection and defence, in case of Indian hostilities. For such service the Canadian voyageurs were little to be depended upon, fighting not being a part of their profession. The proper kind of men were American hunters, experienced in savage life and savage warfare, and possessed of the true game spirit of the west. Leaving, therefore, the encampment in charge of the other partners, Mr. Hunt set off on foot on the first of January, (1810) for St. Louis. He was accompanied by eight men as far as fort Osage, about one hundred and fifty miles below Nodowa. Here he procured a couple of horses, and pro ceeded on the remainder of his journey with two men, sending the other six back to the encampment. He arrived at St. Louis on the 20th of January."], [156, "148 MR. HENRY AND THE BLACKFEET. CHAPTER XV.

On this his second visit to St. Louis, Mr. Hunt was again impeded in his plans by the opposition of the Missouri Fur Company. The affairs of that company were, at this time, in a very dubious state. During the preceding year, their prin cipal establishment at the forks of the Missouri had been so much harassed by the Blackfeet Indians, that its commander, Mr. Henry, one of the partners, had been compelled to aban don the post and cross the Rocky mountains, with the inten tion of fixing himself upon one of the upper branches of the Columbia. What had become of him and his party was unknown. The most intense anxiety was felt concerning them, and apprehensions that they might have been cut off by the savages. At the time of Mr. Hunt's arrival at St. Louis, the Missouri Company were fitting out an expedition to go in"], [157, "149 DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF A HYBRID FAMILY quest of Mr. Henry. It was to be conducted by Mr. Manuel Lisa, the enterprising partner already mentioned. There being thus two expeditions on foot at the same moment, an unusual demand was occasioned for hunters and voyageurs, who accordingly profited by the circumstance, and stipulated for high terms. Mr. Hunt found a keen and subtle competitor in Lisa, and was obliged to secure his recruits by liberal advances of pay, and by other pecuniary indulgences. The greatest difficulty was to procure the Sioux interpreter: There was but one man to be met with at St. Louis who was fitted for the purpose, but to secure him would require much management. The individual in question was a half-breed, named Pierre Dorion ; and, as he figures hereafter in this narrative, and is, withal, a striking specimen of the hybrid race on the frontier, we shall give a few particulars concern ing him. Pierre was the son of Dorion, the French inter preter, who accompanied Messrs. Lewis and Clarke in their famous exploring expedition across the Rocky mountains. Old Dorion was one of those French Creoles, descendants of the ancient Canadian stock, who abound on the western fron tier, and amalgamate or cohabit with the savages. He had sojourned among various tribes, and perhaps left progeny among them all ; but his regular, or habitual wife, was a Sioux squaw. By her he had a hopeful brood of half-breed sons, of whom Pierre was one. The domestic affairs of old Dorion were conducted on the true Indian plan. Father and sons would occasionally get drunk together, and then the cabin was a scene of ruffian brawl and fighting, in the course of which the old Frenchman was apt to get soundly belabored by his mongrel offspring. In a furious scuffle of the kind, one of the sons got the old man upon the ground, and was upon the point 13*"], [158, "150 PIERRE DORION AND HIS WHISKEY DEBT. of scalping him. \" Hold ! my son,\" cried the old fellow, in imploring accents, \" you are too brave, too honorable to scalp your father !\" This last appeal touched the French side of the half-breed's heart, so he suffered the old man to wear his scalp unharmed. Of this hopeful stock was Pierre Dorion, the man whom it was now the desire of Mr. Hunt to engage as an interpreter. He had been employed in that capacity by the Missouri Fur Company during the preceding year, and had conducted their traders in safety through the different tribes of the Sioux. He had proved himself faithful and serviceable while sober ; but the love of liquor, in which he had been nurtured and brought up, would occasionally break out, and with it the savage side of his character. It was this love of liquor which had embroiled him with the Missouri Company. While in their service at fort Mandan, on the frontier, he had been seized with a whiskey mania ; and, as the beverage was only to be procured at the company's store, it had been charged in his account at the rate of ten dollars a quart. This item had ever remained unsettled, and a matter of furious dispute, the mere mention of which was sufficient to put him in a passion. The moment it was discovered by Mr. Lisa that Pierre Dorion was in treaty with tbe new and rival association, he endeavored, by threats as well as promises, to prevent his engaging in their service. His promises might, perhaps, have prevailed ; but his threats, which related to the whiskey debt, only served to drive Pierre into the opposite ranks. Still, he took advantage of this competition for his services to stand out with Mr. Hunt on the most advantageous terms, and, after a negotiation of nearly two weeks, capitulated to serve in the expedition, as hunter and interpreter, at the rate of three hun-"], [159, "RENEGADOES FROM NODOWA. 151 dred dollars a year, two hundred of which were to be paid in advance. When Mr. Hunt had got every thing ready for leaving St. Louis, new difficulties arose. Five of the American hunters, from the encampment at Nodowa, suddenly made their appear ance. They alleged that they had been ill treated by the partners at the encampment, and had come off clandestinely, in consequence of a dispute. It was useless at the present moment, and under present circumstances, to attempt any compulsory measures with these deserters. Two of them Mr. Hunt prevailed upon, by mild means, to return with him. The rest refused ; nay, what was worse, they spread such reports of the hardships and dangers to be apprehended in the course of the expedition, that they struck a panic into those hunters who had recently engaged at St. Louis, and, when the hour of departure arrived, all but one refused to embark. It was in vain to plead or remonstrate ; they shouldered their rifles and turned their back upon the expedition, and Mr. Hunt was fain to put off from shore with the single hunter and a number of voyageurs whom he had engaged. Even Pierre Dorion, at the last moment, refused to enter the boat until Mr. Hunt consented to take his squaw and two children on board also. But the tissue of perplexities, on account of this worthy individual, did not end here. Among the various persons who were about to proceed up the Missouri with Mr. Hunt, were two scientific gentlemen : one Mr. John Bradbury, a man of mature age, but great enter prise and personal activity, who had been sent out by the Linnean Society of Liverpool, to make a collection of Ameri can plants ; the other a Mr. Nuttall, likewise an Englishman, younger in years, who has since made himself known as the author of \" Travels in Arkansas,\" and a work on the \" Genera"], [160, "152 LEGAL PERPLEXITIES OF PIERRE DORION. of American Plants.\" Mr. Hunt had offered them the protec tion and facilities of his party, in their scientific researches up the Missouri. As they were not ready to depart at the moment of embarcation, they put their trunks on board of the boat, but remained at St. Louis until the next day, for the arri val of the post, intending to join the expedition at St. Charles, a short distance above the mouth of the Missouri. The same evening, however, they learned that a writ had been issued against Pierre Dorion for his whiskey debt, by Mr. Lisa, as agent of the Missouri Company, and that it was the intention to entrap the mongrel linguist on his arrival at St. Charles. Upon hearing this, Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Nutt all set off a little after midnight, by land, got ahead of the boat as it was ascending the Missouri, before its arrival at St. Charles, and gave Pierre Dorion warning of the legal toil prepared to ensnare him. The knowing Pierre immediately landed and took to the woods, followed by his squaw laden with their papooses, and a large bundle containing their most precious effects ; promising to rejoin the party some distance above St. Charles. There seemed little dependance to be placed upon the promises of a loose adventurer of the kind, who was at the very time playing an evasive game with his former employers ; who had already received two-thirds of his year's pay, and had his rifle on his shoulder, \"his family and worldly fortune at his heels, and the wild woods before him. There was no alternative, however, and it was hoped his pique against his old employers would render him faith ful to his new ones. The party reached St. Charles in the afternoon, but the har pies of the law looked in vain for their expected prey. The boats resumed their course on the following morning, and had not proceeded far when Pierre Dorion made his appearance"], [161, "153 CONJUGAL DISCIPLINE OF A HALF-BREED. on the shore. He was gladly taken on board, but he came without his squaw. They had quarrelled in the night ; Pierre had administered the Indian discipline of the cudgel, where upon she had taken to the woods, with their children and all their worldly goods. Pierre evidently was deeply grieved and disconcerted at the loss of his wife and his knapsack, where fore Mr. Hunt dispatched one of the Canadian voyageurs in search of the fugitive ; and the whole party, after proceeding a few miles further, encamped on an island to await his return. The Canadian rejoined the party, but without the squaw ; and Pierre Dorion passed a solitary and anxious night, bitterly regretting his indiscretion in having exercised his conjugal authority so near home. Before daybreak, however, a well known voice reached his ears from the opposite shore. It was his repentant spouse, who had been wandering the woods all night in quest of the party, and had at length descried it by its fires. A boat was dispatched for her, the interesting family was once more united, and Mr. Hunt now flattered himself that his perplexities with Pierre Dorion were at an end. Bad weather, very heavy rains, and an unusually early rise in the Missouri, rendered the ascent of the river toilsome, slow, and dangerous. The rise of the Missouri does not generally take place until the month of May or June : the present swelling of the river must have been caused by a freshet in some of its more southern branches. It could not have been the great annual flood, as the higher branches must still have been ice-bound. And here we cannot but pause, to notice the admirable arrangement of nature, by which the annual swellings of the various great rivers which empty themselves into the Missis sippi, have been made to precede each other at considerable intervals. Thus, the flood of the Red river precedes that of"], [162, "154 DANIEL BOON. the Arkansas by a month. The Arkansas, also, rising in a much more southern latitude than the Missouri, takes the lead of it in its annual excess, and its superabundant waters are disgorged and disposed of long before the breaking up of the icy barriers of the north ; otherwise, did all these mighty streams rise simultaneously, and discharge their vernal floods into the Mississippi, an inundation would be the consequence, that would submerge and devastate all the lower country. On the afternoon of the third day, January 17th, the boats touched at Charette, one of the old villages founded by the original French colonists. Here they met with Daniel Boon, the renowned patriarch of Kentucky, who had kept in the advance of civilization, and on the borders of the wilderness, still leading a hunter's life, though now in his eighty-fifth year. He had but recently returned from a hunting and trap ping expedition, and had brought nearly sixty beaver skins as trophies of his skill. The old man was still erect in form, strong in limb, .and unflinching in spirit; and as he stood on the river bank, watching the departure of an expedition des tined to traverse the wilderness to the very shores of the Pacific, very probably felt a throb of his old pioneer spirit, impelling him to shoulder his rifle and join the adventurous band. Boon flourished several years after this meeting, in a vigorous old age, the Nestor of hunters and backwoodmen ; and died, full of sylvan honor and renown, in 1818, in his ninety-second year. The next morning early, as the party were yet encamped at the mouth of a small stream, they were visited by another of these heroes of the wilderness, one John Colter, who had accompanied Lewis and Clarke in their memorable expedition. He had recently made one of those vast internal voyages so eharacteristic of this fearless class of men, and of the immense"], [163, "JOHN COLTER. 155 legions over which they hold their lonely wanderings ; having come from the head waters of the Missouri to St. Louis in a small canoe. This distance of three thousand miles he had accomplished in thirty days. Colter kept with the party all the morning. He had many particulars to give them concern ing the Blackfeet Indians, a restless and predatory tribe, who had conceived an implacable hostility to the white men, in consequence of one of their warriors having been killed by Captain Lewis, while attempting to steal horses. Through the country infested by these savages the expedition would have to proceed, and Colter was urgent in reiterating the precautions that ought to be observed respecting them. He had himself experienced their vindictive cruelty, and his story deserves particular citation, as showing the hairbreadth adventures to which these solitary rovers of the wilderness are exposed. Colter, with the hardihood of a regular trapper, had cast himself loose from the party of Lewis and Clarke in the very heart of the wilderness, and had remained to trap beaver alone on the head waters of the Missouri. Here he fell in with another lonely trapper, like himself, named Potts, and they agreed to keep together. They were in the very region of the terrible Blackfeet, at that time thirsting to revenge the death of their companion, and knew that they had to expect no mercy at their hands. They were obliged to keep con cealed all day in the woody margins of the rivers, setting their traps after nightfall, and taking them up before daybreak. It was running a fearful risk for the sake of a few beaver skins ; but such is thj life of the trapper. They were on a branch of the Missouri called Jefferson's Fork, and had set their traps at night, about six miles up a small river that emptied into the fork. Early in the morning they ascended the river in a canoe, to examine the traps"], [164, "156 AN AFFAIR WITH THE BLACKFEET. The banks on each side were high and perpendicular, and cast a shade over the stream. As they were softly paddling along, they heard the trampling of many feet upon the banks. Colter immediately gave the alarm of \" Indians !\" and was for instant retreat. Potts scoffed at him for being frightened by the trampling of a herd of buffaloes. Colter checked his uneasiness and paddled forward. They had not gone much further when frightful whoops and yells burst forth from each side of the river, and several hundred Indians appeared on either bank. Signs were made to the unfortunate trappers to come on shore. They were obliged to comply. Before they could get out of their canoe, a savage seized the rifle belong ing to Potts. Colter sprang on shore, wrested the weapon from the hands of the Indian, and restored it to his companion, who was still in the canoe, and immediately pushed into the stream. There was the sharp twang of a bow, and Potts cried out that he was wounded. Colter urged him to come on shore and submit, as his only chance for life ; but the other knew there was no prospect of mercy, and determined to die game. Levelling his rifle, he shot one of the savages dead on the spot. The next moment he fell himself, pierced with innumerable arrows. The vengeance of the savages now turned upon Colter. He was stripped naked, and, having some knowledge of the Blackfoot language, overheard a consultation as to the mode of dispatching him, so as to derive the greatest amusement from his death. Some were for setting him up as a mark, and having a trial of skill at his expense. The chief, however, was for nobler sport. He seized Colter by the shoulder, and demanded if he could run fast. The unfortunate trapper was too well acquainted with Indian customs not to comprehend the drift of the question. He knew he was to run for his fife,"], [165, "157 A SCAMFER FOR LIFE. to furnish a kind of human hunt to his persecutors. Though in reality he was noted among his brother hunters for swift ness of foot, he assured the chief that he was a very bad runner. His stratagem gained him some vantage ground. He was led by the chief into the prairie, about four hundred yards from the main body of savages, and then turned loose, to save himself if he could. A tremendous yell let him know that the whole pack of bloodhounds were off in full cry. Colter flew, rather than ran ; he was astonished at his own speed ; but he had six miles of prairie to traverse before he should reach the Jefferson fork of the Missouri ; how could he hope to hold out such a distance with the fearful odds of several hundred to one against him ! The plain too, abounded with the prickly pear, which wounded his naked feet. Still he fled on, dreading each moment to hear the twang of a bow, and to feel an arrow quivering at his heart. He did not even dare to look round, lest he should lose an inch of that distance on which his life depended. He had ran nearly half way across the plain when the sound of pursuit grew somewhat fainter, and he ventured to turn his head. The mam bony ui his pursuers were a considerable distance behind ; several of the faster runners were scattered in the advance ; while a swift-footed warrior, armed with a spear, was not more than a hundred yards behind him. Inspired with new hope, Colter redoubled his exertions, but strained himself to such a degree, that the blood gushed from his mouth and nostrils, and streamed down his breast. He arrived within a mile of the river. The sound of footsteps gathered upon him. A glance behind showed his pursuer within twenty yards, and preparing to launch his spear. Stopping short, he turned round and spread out his arms. The savage, confounded by this sudden action, attempted to 14"], [166, "158 A SWIM FOR LIFE. stop and to hurl his spear, but fell in the very act. His spear stuck in the ground, and the shaft broke in his hand. Colter plucked up the pointed part, pinned the savage to the earth, and continued his flight. The Indians, as they arrived at their slaughtered companion, stopped to howl over him. Col ter made the most of this precious delay, gained the skirt of cotton-wood bordering the river, dashed through it, and plunged into the stream. He swam to a neighboring island, against the upper end of which the driftwood had lodged in such quantities as to form a natural raft ; under this he dived, and swam below water until he succeeded in getting a breath ing place between the floating trunks of trees, whose branches and bushes formed a covert several feet above the level of the water. He had scarcely drawn breath after all his toils, when he heard his pursuers on the river bank, whooping and yelling like so many fiends. They plunged in the river, and swam to the raft. The heart of Colter almost died within him as he saw them, through the chinks of his concealment, passing and repassing, and seeking for him in all directions. They at length gave up the search, and he began to rejoice in his escape, when the idea presented itself that they might set the raft on fire. Here was a new source of horrible apprehen sion, in which he remained until night fall. Fortunately, the idea did not suggest itself to the Indians. As soon as it was dark, finding by the silence around that his pursuers had de parted, Colter dived again, and came up beyond the raft. He then swam silently down the river for a considerable distance, when he landed, and kept on all night, to get as far off as pos sible from this dangerous neighborhood. By daybreak he had gained sufficient distance to relieve him from the terrors of his savage foes ; but now new sources of inquietude presented themselves. He was naked and alone,"], [167, "PERILS OF THE PRAIRIES. 159 in the midst of an unbounded wilderness ; his only chance was to reach a trading post of the Missouri company, situated on a branch of the Yellowstone river. Even should he elude his pursuers, days must elapse before he could reach this post, during which he must traverse immense prairies destitute of shade, his naked body exposed to the burning heat of the sun by day, and the dews and chills of the night season ; and his feet lacerated by the thorns of the prickly pear. Though he might see game in abundance around him, he had no means of killing any for his sustenance, and must depend for food upon the roots of the earth. In defiance of these difficulties he pushed resolutely forward, guiding himself in his trackless course by those signs and indications known only to Indians and backwoodmen ; and after braving dangers and hardships enough to break down any spirit but that of a western pioneer, arrived safe at the solitary post in question.* Such is a sample of the rugged experience which Colter had to relate of savage life ; yet, with all these perils and terrors fresh in his recollection, he could not see the present band on their way to those regions of danger and adventure, without feeling a vehement impulse to join them. A western trapper is like a sailor ; past hazards only stimulate him to further risks. The vast prairie is to the one what the ocean is to the other, a boundless field of enterprise and exploit. However he may have suffered in his last cruise, he is always ready to join a new expedition ; and the more adventurous its nature, the more attractive is it to his vagrant spirit. Nothing seems to have kept Colter from continuing with the party to the shores of the Pacific but the circumstance of his having recently married. All the morning he kept with * Bradbury.

Here Pierre Dorion met with some of his old comrades, with whom he had a long gossip, and returned to the camp with rumors of bloody feuds between the Osages and the Ioways, or Ayaways, Potowatomies, Sioux, and Sawkees. Blood had already been shed, and scalps been taken. A war party, three hundred strong, were prowling in the neighborhood ; others might be met with higher up the river ; it behooved the travellers, therefore, to be upon their guard against robbery or surprise, for an Indian war party on the march is prone to acts of outrage- In consequence of this report, which was subsequently confirmed by further intelligence, a guard was kept up at night round the encampment, and they all slept on their arms. As they were sixteen in number, and well supplied with weapons and ammunition, they trusted to be able to give any marauding party a warm reception. Nothing occurred, how ever, to molest them on their voyage, and on the 8th of April they came in sight of fort Osage. On their approach the flag was hoisted on the fort, and they -saluted it by a dis charge of fire-arms. Within a short distance of the fort was an Osage village, the inhabitants of which, men, women, and children, thronged down to the water side to witness their landing. One of the first persons they met on the river bank was Mr. Crooks, who had come down in a boat, with nine men, from the winter encampment at Nodowa, to meet them."], [169, "161 A CONJUGAL CUDGELLING. They remained at fort Osage a part of three days, during which they were hospitably entertained at the garrison by Lieutenant Brownson, who held a temporary command. They were regaled also with a war-feast at the village ; the Osage warriors having returned from a successful foray against the Ioways, in which they had taken seven scalps. These were paraded on poles about the village, followed by the warriors decked out in all their savage ornaments, and hideously painted as if for battle. By the Osage warriors, Mr. Hunt and his companions were again warned to be on their guard in ascending the river, as the Sioux tribe meant to lay in wait and attack them. On the 10th of April they again embarked, their party being now augmented to twenty-six, by the addition of -Mr. Crooks and his boat's crew. They had not proceeded far, however, when there was a great outcry from one of the boats ; it was occasioned by a little domestic discipline in the Dorion family. The squaw of the worthy interpreter, it ap peared, had been so delighted with the scalp-dance, and other festivities of the Osage village, that she had taken a strong inclination to remain there. This had been as strongly op posed by her liege lord, who had compelled her to embark. The good dame had remained sulky ever since, whereupon Pierre, seeing no other mode of exorcising the evil spirit out of her, and being perhaps a little inspired by whiskey, had resorted to the Indian remedy of the cudgel, and, before his neighbors could interfere, had belabored her so soundly, that there is no record of her having shown any refractory symp toms throughout the remainder of the expedition. For a week they continued their voyage, exposed to almost incessant rains. The bodies of drowned buffaloes floated past them in vast numbers ; many had drifted upon the shore, or 14*"], [170, "162 SUBLIMITY OF A TURKEY-BUZZARD. against the upper ends of the rafts and islands. These had attracted great flights of turkey-buzzards ; some were banquet ing on the carcasses, others were soaring far aloft in the sky, and others were perched on the trees, with their backs to the sun, and their wings stretched out to dry, like so many vessels in harbor, spreading their sails after a shower. The turkey-buzzard (vultur aura, or golden vulture), when on the wing, is one of the most specious and imposing of birds. Its flight in the upper regions of the air is really sub lime, extending its immense wings, and wheeling slowly and majestically to and fro, seemingly without exerting a muscle or fluttering a feather, but moving by mere volition, and sailing on the bosom of the air, as a ship upon the ocean. Usurping the empyreal realm of the eagle, he assumes for a time the port and dignity of that majestic bird, and often is mistaken for him by ignorant crawlers upon earth. It is only when he descends from the clouds to pounce upon carrion that he betrays his low propensities, and reveals his caitiff character. Near at hand he is a disgusting bird, ragged in plumage, base in aspect, and of loathsome odor.

The weather continued rainy and ungenial for some days after Mr. Hunt's return to Nodowa ; yet spring was rapidly advancing, and vegetation was putting forth with all its early freshness and beauty. The snakes began to recover from their torpor and crawl forth into day, and the neighborhood of the wintering house seems to have been much infested with them. Mr. Bradbury, in the course of his botanical researches, found a surprising number in a half torpid state, under flat stones upon the banks which overhung the cantonment, and narrowly escaped being struck by a rattlesnake, which darted at him from a cleft in the rock, but fortunately gave him warn ing by its rattle. The pigeons too were filling the woods in vast migratory flocks. It is almost incredible to describe the prodigious flights of these birds in the western wildernesses. They appear absolutely in clouds, and move with astonishing velocity, their wings making a whistling sound as they fly."], [172, "164 GREAT FLIGHT OF PIGEONS. The rapid evolutions of these flocks, wheeling and shifting suddenly as if with one mind and one impulse ; the flashing changes of colour they present, as their backs, their breasts, or the under part of their wings are turned to the spectator, are singularly pleasing. When they alight, if on the ground, they cover whole acres at a time ; if upon trees, the branches often break beneath their weight. If suddenly startled while feeding in the midst of a forest, the noise they make in getting on the wing is like the roar of a cataract or the sound of dis tant thunder. A flight of this kind, like an Egyptian flight of locusts, devours every thing that serves for its food as it passes along. So great were the numbers in the vicinity of the camp that Mr. Bradbury, in the course of a morning's excursion, shot nearly three hundred with a fowlingpiece. He gives a curi ous, though apparently a faithful, account of the kind of disci pline observed in these immense flocks, so that each may have a chance of picking up food. As the front ranks must meet with the greatest abundance, and the rear ranks must have scanty pickings, the instant a rank finds itself the hindmost, it rises in the air, flies over the whole flock, and takes its place in the advance. The next rank follows in its course, and thus the last is continually becoming first, and all by turns have a front place at the banquet. The rains having at length subsided, Mr. Hunt broke up the encampment and resumed his course up the Missouri. The party now consisted of nearly sixty persons : of whom five were partners ; one, John Reed, was a clerk ; forty were Canadian \" voyageurs,\" or \" engages,\" and there were sev eral hunters. They embarked in four boats, one of wliich was of a large size, mounting a swivel and two howitzers. All were furnished with masts and sails, to be used when the"], [173, "MOUTH OF THE NEBRASKA. 165 wind was sufficiently favorable and strong to overpower the current of the river. Such was the case for the first four or five days, when they were wafted steadily up the stream by a strong southeaster. Their encampments at night were often pleasant and pic turesque : on some beautiful bank, beneath spreading trees, which afforded them shelter and fuel. The tents were pitch ed, the fires made, and the meals prepared by the voyageurs, and many a story was told and joke passed, and song sung, round the evening fire. All, however, were asleep at an early hour. Some under the tents, others wrapped in blankets be fore the fire, or beneath the trees ; and some few in the boats and canoes. On the 28th, they breakfasted on one of the islands which lie at the mouth of the Nebraska or Platte river ; the largest tributary of the Missouri, and about six hundred miles above its confluence with the Mississippi. This broad but shallow stream flows for an immense distance through a wide and ver dant valley, scooped out of boundless prairies. It draws its main supplies, by several forks or branches, from the Rocky mountains. The mouth of this river is established as the dividing point between the upper and lower Missouri ; and the earlier voyagers, in their toilsome ascent, before the introduc tion of steam-boats, considered one half of their labors accom plished when they reached this place. The passing of the mouth of the Nebraska, therefore, was equivalent among boat men to the crossing of the line among sailors, and was cele brated with like ceremonials of a rough and waggish nature, practised upon the uninitiated ; among which was the old nau tical joke of shaving. The river deities, however, like those of the sea, were to be propitiated by a bribe, and the infliction of these rude honors to be parried by a treat to the adepts."], [174, "166 SIGNS OF INDIAN WAR PARTIES. At the mouth of the Nebraska new signs were met with ol war parties which had recently been in the vicinity. There was the frame of a skin canoe, in which the warriors had trav ersed the river. At night, also, the lurid reflection of immense fires hung in the sky, showing the conflagration of great tracts of the prairies. Such fires not being made by hunters so late in the season, it was supposed they were caused by some wandering war parties. These often take the precaution to set the prairies on fire behind them to conceal their traces from their enemies. This is chiefly done when the party has been unsuccessful and is on the retreat, and apprehensive of pursuit. At such time it is not safe even for friends to fall in with them, as they are apt to be in savage humor, and disposed to vent their spleen in capricious outrage. These signs, therefore, of a band of marauders on the prowl, called for some degree of vigilance on the part of the travellers. After passing the Nebraska, the party halted for part of two days on the bank of the river, a little above Papillion creek, to supply themselves with a stock of oars and poles from the tough wood of the ash, which is not met with higher up the Missouri. While the voyageurs were thus occupied, the nat uralists rambled over the adjacent country to collect plants. From the summit of a range of bluffs on the opposite side of the river, about two hundred and fifty feet high, they had one of those vast and magnificent prospects which sometimes unfold themselves in these boundless regions. Below them was the valley of the Missouri, about seven miles in breadth, clad in the fresh verdure of spring ; enamelled with flowers and interspersed with clumps and groves of noble trees, be tween which the mighty river poured its turbulent and turbid stream. The interior of the country presented a singular scene ; the immense waste being broken up by innumerable"], [175, "DESERTION OF TWO HUNTERS. 167 green hills, not above eighty feet in height, but extremely steep, and acutely pointed at their summits. A long line of bluffs extended for upwards of thirty miles, parallel to the Missouri, with a shallow lake stretching along their base, which had evidently once formed a bed of the river. The surface of this lake was covered with aquatic plants, on the broad leaves of which numbers of water snakes, drawn forth by the genial warmth of spring, were basking in the sunshine. On the 2d of May, at the usual hour of embarking, the camp was thrown into some confusion by two of the hunters, named Harrington, expressing their intention to abandon the expe dition and return home. One of these had joined the party in the preceding autumn, having been hunting for two years on the Missouri : the other had engaged at St. Louis, in the fol lowing March, and had come up from thence with Mr. Hunt. He now declared that he had enlisted merely for the purpose of following his brother and persuading him to return ; having been enjoined to do so by his mother, whose anxiety had been awakened by the idea of his going on such a wild and distant expedition. The loss of two stark hunters and prime riflemen was a serious affair to the party, for they were approaching the region where they might expect hostilities from the Sioux ; indeed, throughout the whole of their perilous journey, the services of such men would be all important, for little reliance was to be placed upon the valor of the Canadians in case of attack. Mr. Hunt endeavored by arguments, expostulations, and entreaties, to shake the determination of the two brothers. He represented to them that they were between six and seven hundred miles above the mouth of the Missouri ; that they would have four hundred miles to go before they could reach the habitation of a white man, throughout which they would be"], [176, "168 INDIAN DESPERADOES. exposed to all kinds of risks ; since he declared, if they per sisted in abandoning him and breaking their faith, he would not furnish them with a single round of ammunition. All was in vain ; they obstinately persisted in their resolution ; where upon, Mr. Hunt, partly incited by indignation, partly by the policy of deterring others from desertion, put his threat in execution, and left them to find their way back to the settle ments without, as he supposed, a single bullet or a charge of powder. The boats now continued their slow and toilsome course for several days, against the current of the river. The late signs of roaming war parties caused a vigilant watch to be kept up at night when the crews encamped on shore ; nor was this vigilance superfluous ; for on the night of the seventh instant, there was a wild and fearful yell, and eleven Sioux warriors, stark naked, with tomahawks in their hands, rushed into the camp. They were instantly surrounded and seized, where upon their leader called out to his followers to desist from any violence, and pretended to be perfectly pacific in his inten tions. It proved, however, that they were a part of the war party, the skeleton of whose canoe had been seen at the mouth of the river Platte, and the reflection of whose fires had been descried in the air. They had been disappointed or defeated in their foray, and in their rage and mortification these eleven warriors had \" devoted their clothes to the medi cine.\" This is a desperate act of Indian braves when soiled in war, and in dread of scoffs and sneers. In such case they sometimes throw off their clothes and ornaments, devote them selves to the Great Spirit, and attempt some reckless exploit with which to cover their disgrace. Woe to any defenceless party of white men that may then fall in their way ! Such was the explanation given by Pierre Dorion, the half-"], [177, "VILLAGE OF THE OMAHAS. 169 breed interpreter, of this wild intrusion into the camp ; and the party were so exasperated when apprized of the sangui nary intentions of the prisoners, that they were for shooting them on the spot. Mr. Hunt, however, exerted his usual moderation and humanity, and ordered that they should be conveyed across the river in one of the boats, threatening them, however, with certain death, if again caught in any hostile act. On the 10th of May the party arrived at the Omaha (pro nounced Omawhaw) village, about eight hundred and thirty miles above the mouth of the Missouri, and encamped in its neighborhood. The village was situated under a hill on the bank of the river, and consisted of about eighty lodges. These were of a circular and conical form, and about sixteen feet in diameter ; being mere tents of dressed buffalo skins, sewed together and stretched on long poles, inclined towards each other so as to cross at about half their height. Thus the naked tops of the poles diverge in such a manner that, if they were covered with skins like the lower ends, the tent would be shaped like an hour glass, and present the appearance of one cone inverted on the apex of another. The forms of Indian lodges are worthy of attention, each tribe having a different mode of shaping and arranging them, so that it is easy to tell on seeing a lodge or an encampment at a distance, to what tribe the inhabitants belong. The exte rior of the Omaha lodges have often a gay and fanciful appear ance, being painted with undulating bands of red or yellow, or decorated with rude figures of horses, deer, and bu\u00c6aloes, and with human faces, painted like full moons, four and five feet broad. The Omahas were once one of the numerous and powerful tribes of the prairies, vying in warlike might and prowess 15"], [178, "170 CHIVALRY IN ITS WILD STATE. with the Sioux, the Pawnees, the Sauks, the Konzas, and the Iatans. Their wars with the Sioux, however, had thinned their ranks, and the smallpox in 1802 had swept off two thirds of their number. At the time of Mr. Hunt's visit they still boasted about two hundred warriors and hunters, but they are now fast melting away, and before long, will be numbered among those extinguished nations of the west that exist but in tradition. In his correspondence with Mr. Astor, from this point of his journey, Mr. Hunt gives a sad account of the Indian tribes bordering on the river. They were in continual war with each other, and their wars were of the most harassing kind ; consisting, not merely of main conflicts and expeditions of moment, involving the sackings, burnings and massacres of towns and villages, but of individual acts of treachery, murder, and cold-blooded cruelty; or of vaunting and foolhardy exploits of single warriors, either to avenge some personal wrong, or gain the vainglorious trophy of a scalp. The lonely hunter, the wandering wayfarer, the poor squaw cutting wood or gathering corn, was liable to be surprised and slaughtered. In this way tribes were either swept away at once, or gradually thinned out, and savage life was surrounded with constant horrors and alarms. That the race of red men should diminish from year to year, and so few should survive of the numerous nations wliich evidently once peopled the vast regions of the west, is nothing surprising ; it is rather matter of surprise that so many should survive ; for the existence of a savage in these parts seeias little better than a prolonged and all besetting death. It is, in fact, a caricature of the boasted romance of feudal times ; chivalry in its native and uncultured state, and knight-errantry rur. wild. In their more prosperous days, the Omahas looked upon"], [179, "BLACKBIRD, THE OMAHA CHIEF. 171 themselves as the most powerful and perfect of human beings, and considered all created things as made for their peculiar use and benefit. It is this tribe of whose chief, the famous Wash-ing-guh-sah-ba, or Blackbird, such savage and romantic stories are told. He had died about ten years previous to the arrival of Mr. Hunt's party, but his name was still mentioned with awe by his people. He was one of the first among the Indian chiefs on the Missouri to deal with the white traders, and showed great sagacity in levying his royal dues. When a trader arrived in his village, he caused all his goods to be brought into his lodge and opened. From these he selected whatever suited his sovereign pleasure ; blankets, tobacco, whiskey, powder, ball, beads and red paint ; and laid the arti- cles on one side, without deigning to give any compensation. Then calling to him his herald or crier, he would order him to mount on top of the lodge and summon all the tribe to bring in their peltries, and trade with the white man. The lodge would soon be crowded with Indians bringing bear, beaver, otter, and other skins. No one was allowed to dispute the prices fixed by the white trader upon his articles ; who took care to indemnify himself five times over for the goods set apart by the chief. In this way the Blackbird enriched himself, and enriched the white men, and became exceedingly popular among the traders of the Missouri. His people, however, were not equally satisfied by a regulation of trade which worked so manifestly against them, and began to show signs of discontent. Upon this a crafty and unprincipled trader revealed a secret to the Blackbird, by which he might acquire unbounded sway over his ignorant and superstitious subjects. He instructed him in the poisonous qualities of arsenic, and furnished liim with an ample supply of that baneful drug. From this time the Blackbird seemed endowed with super"], [180, "DEADLY SECRET OF THE BLACKBIRD. 172 natural powers, to possess the gift of prophecy, and to hold the disposal of life and death within his hands. Wo to any one who questioned his authority or dared to dispute his commands . The Blackbird prophesied his death within a certain time, and he had the secret means of verifying his prophecy. Within the fated period the offender was smitten with strange and sudden disease, and perished from the face of the earth. Every one stood aghast at these multiplied examples of his superhuman might, and dreaded to displease so omnipotent and vindictive a being ; and the Blackbird enjoyed a wide and undisputed sway. It was not, however, by terror alone that he ruled his people ; he was a warrior of the first order, and his exploits in arms were the theme of young and old. His career had begun by hardships, having been taken prisoner by the Sioux in early youth. Under his command, the Omahas obtained great character for military prowess, nor did he permit an in sult or injury to one of his tribe to pass unrevenged. The Pawnee republicans had inflicted a gross indignity on a favor ite and distinguished Omaha brave. The Blackbird assem bled his warriors, led them against the Pawnee town, attacked it with irresistible fury, slaughtered a great number of its in habitants, and burnt it to the ground. He waged fierce and bloody war against the Ottoes for many years, until peace was effected between them by the mediation of the whites. Fear less in battle, and fond of signalizing himself, he dazzled his followers by his daring acts. In attacking a Kanza village, he rode singly round it, loading and discharging his rifle at the inhabitants as he galloped past them. He kept up in war the same idea of mysterious and supernatural power. At one time, when pursuing a war party by their tracks across the prairies, he repeatedly discharged his rifle into the prints"], [181, "THE POWER OF BEAUTY. 173 made by their feet and by the hoofs of their horses, assuring his followers that he would thereby cripple the fugitives, so that they would easily be overtaken. He in fact did overtake them, and destroyed them almost to a man ; and his victory was considered miraculous, both by friend and foe. By these and similar exploits, he made himself the pride and boast of his people, and became popular among them, notwithstanding his death-denouncing fiat. With all his savage and terrific qualities, he was sensible of the power of female beauty, and capable of love. A war party of the Poncas had made a foray into the lands of the Omahas, and carried off a number of women and horses. The Blackbird was roused to fury, and took the field with all his braves, swearing to \" eat up the Ponca nation,\" \u2014 the Indian threat of exterminating war. The Poncas, sorely pressed, took refuge behind a rude bulwark of earth ; but the Blackbird kept up so galling a fire, that he seemed likely to execute his menace. In their extremity they sent forth a herald, bearing the calumet or pipe of peace, but he was shot down by order of the Blackbird. Another herald was sent forth in similar guise, but he shared a like fate. The Ponca chief then, as a last hope, arrayed his beautiful daughter in her finest orna ments, and sent her forth with a calumet, to sue for peace. The charms of the Indian maid touched the stern heart of the Blackbird ; he accepted the pipe at her hand, smoked it, and from that time a peace took place between the Poncas and the Omahas. This beautiful damsel, in all probability, was the favorite wife whose fate makes so tragic an incident in the story of the Blackbird. Her youth and beauty had gained an absolute sway over his rugged heart, so that he distinguished her above all his other wives. The habitual gratification of his 15*"], [182, "174 BLACKBIRD AND HIS WIFE. vindictive impulses, however, had taken away from him all mastery over his passions, and rendered him liable to the most furious transports of rage. In one of these his beautiful wife had the misfortune to offend him, when suddenly drawing his knife, he laid her dead at his feet with a single blow. In an instant his frenzy was at an end. He gazed for a time in mute bewilderment upon his victim ; then drawing his buffalo robe over his head, he sat down beside the corpse, and remained brooding over his crime and his loss. Three days elapsed, yet the chief continued silent and motionless ; tasting no food, and apparently sleepless. It was apprehended that he intended to starve himself to death ; his people approached him in trembling awe, and entreated him once more to uncover his face and be comforted ; but he remained unmoved. At length one of his warriors brought in a small child, and laying it on the ground, placed the foot of the Blackbird upon its neck. The heart of the gloomy savage was touched by this appeal ; he threw aside his robe ; made an harangue upon what he had done ; and from that time forward seemed to have thrown the load of grief and remorse from his mind. He still retained his fatal and mysterious secret, and with it his terrific power ; but, though able to deal death to his ene mies, he could not avert it from himself or his friends. In 1802 the smallpox, that dreadful pestilence, which swept over the land like a fire over the prairies, made its appearance in the village of the Omahas. The poor savages saw with dis may the ravages of a malady, loathsome and agonizing in its details, and which set the skill and experience of their con jurers and medicine men at defiance. In a little while, two thirds of the population were swept from the face of the earth, and the doom of the rest seemed sealed. The stoicism of the warriors was at an end ; they became wild and despe-"], [183, "DEATH OF BLACKBIRD. 175 rate ; some set fire to the village as a last means of checking the pestilence ; others, in a frenzy of despair, put their wives and children to death, that they might be spared the agonies of an inevitable disease, and that they might all go to some better country. When the general horror and dismay was at its height, the Blackbird himself was struck down with the malady. The poor savages, when they saw their chief in danger, forgot their own miseries, and surrounded his dying bed. His domi nant spirit, and his love for the white men, were evinced in his latest breath, with which he designated his place of sepul ture. It was to be on a hill or promontory, upwards of four hundred feet in height, overlooking a great extent of the Mis souri, from whence he had been accustomed to watch for the barks of the white men. The Missouri washes the base of the promontory, and after winding and doubling in many links and mazes in the plain below, returns to within nine hundred yards of its starting place ; so that for thirty miles navigating with sail and oar, the voyager finds himself continually near to this singular promontory as if spell bound. It was the dying command of the Blackbird that his tomb should be upon the summit of this hill, in which he should be interred, seated on his favorite horse, that he might overlook his ancient domain, and behold the barks of the white men as they came up the river to trade with his people. His dying orders were faithfully obeyed. His corpse was placed astride of his war-steed, and a mound raised over them on the summit of the hill. On top of the mound was erected a staff, from which fluttered the banner of the chieftain, and the scalps that he had taken in battle. When the expedition under Mr. Hunt visited that part of the country, the staff still remained with the fragments of the banner ; and the supersti-"], [184, "176 blackbird's tomb. tious rite of placing food from time to time on the mound, for the use of the deceased, was still observed by the Omahas. That rite has since fallen into disuse, for the tribe itself is almost extinct. Yet the hill of the Blackbird continues an object of veneration to the wandering savage, and a landmark to the voyager of the Missouri ; and as the civilized traveller comes within sight of its spell-bound crest, the mound is pointed out to him from afar, which still encloses the grim skeletons of the Indian warrior and his horse."], [185, "RUMORS OF DANGER. 177 CHAPTER XVII.

While Mr. Hunt and his party were sojourning at the village of the Omahas, three Sioux Indians of the Yankton Ahna tribe arrived, bringing unpleasant intelligence. They reported that certain bands of the Sioux Tetons, who inhabited a region many leagues further up the Missouri, were near at hand, awaiting the approach of the party, with the avowed intention of opposing their progress. The Sioux Tetons were at that time a sort of pirates of the Missouri, who considered the well-freighted bark of the American trader fair game. They had their own traffic with the British merchants of the northwest, who brought them regular supplies of merchandise by way of the river St. Peter. Being thus independent of the Missouri traders for their sup plies, they kept no terms with them, but plundered them when ever they had an opportunity. It has been insinuated that"], [186, "ADVENTURE OF CROOKS AND m'lELLAN. 178 they were prompted to these outrages by the British mer chants, who wished to keep off all rivals in the Indian trade ; but others allege another motive, and one savoring of a deeper policy. The Sioux, by their intercourse with the British traders, had acquired the use of fire-arms, which had given them vast superiority over other tribes higher up the Missouri. They had made themselves also, in a manner, factors for the upper tribes, supplying them at second hand, and at greatly advanced prices, with goods derived from the white men. The Sioux, therefore, saw with jealousy the American traders pushing their way up the Missouri ; fore seeing that the upper tribes would thus be relieved from all dependance on them for supplies ; nay, what was worse, would be furnished with fire-arms, and elevated into formi dable rivals. We have already alluded to a case in which Mr. Crooks and Mr. M'Lellan had been interrupted in a trading voyage by these ruffians of the river, and, as it is in some degree con nected with circumstances hereafter to be related, we shall specify it more particularly. About two years before the time of which we are treating, Crooks and M'Lellan were ascending the river in boats with a party of about forty men, bound on one of their trading expeditions to the upper tribes. In one of the bends of the river, where the channel made a deep curve under impending banks, they suddenly heard yells and shouts above them, and beheld the cliffs overhead covered with armed savages. It was a band of Sioux warriors, upwards of six hundred strong. They brandished their weapons in a menacing manner, and ordered the boats to turn back and land lower down the river. There was no disputing these commands, for they had the power to shower destruction upon the white men, without"], [187, "179 A VOYAGE INTERRUPTED. risk to themselves. Crooks and M'Lellan, therefore, turned back with feigned alacrity ; and, landing, had an interview with the Sioux. The latter forbade them, under pain of ex terminating hostility, from attempting to proceed up the river, but offered to trade peacefully with them if they would halt where they were. The party, being principally composed of voyageurs, was too weak to contend with so superior a force, and one so easily augmented ; they pretended, therefore, to comply cheerfully with their arbitrary dictation, and imme diately proceeded to cut down trees and erect a trading house- The warrior band departed for their village, which was about twenty miles distant, to collect objects of traffic ; they left six or eight of their number, however, to keep watch upon the white men, and scouts were continually passing to and fro with intelligence. Mr. Crooks saw that it would be impossible to prosecute his voyage without the danger of having his boats plundered, and a great part of his men massacred ; he determined, however, not to be entirely frustrated in the objects of his expedition. While he continued, therefore, with great apparent earnest ness and assiduity, the construction of the trading house, he despatched the hunters and trappers of his party in a canoe, to make their way up the river to the original place of desti nation, there to busy themselves in trapping and collecting peltries, and to await his arrival at some future period. As soon as the detachment had had sufficient time to ascend beyond the hostile country of the Sioux, Mr. Crooks suddenly broke up his feigned trading establishment, embarked his men and effects, and, after giving the astonished rear-guard of savages a galling and indignant message to take to their coun trymen, pushed down the river with all speed, sparing neither"], [188, "m'lellan's vow. 180 oar nor paddle, day nor night, until fairly beyond the swoop of these river hawks. What increased the irritation of Messrs. Crooks and M'Lel lan at this mortifying check to their gainful enterprise, was the information that a rival trader was at the bottom of it ; the Sioux, it is said, having been instigated to this outrage by Mr. Manuel Lisa, the leading partner and agent of the Missouri Fur Company, already mentioned. This intelligence, whether true or false, so roused the fiery temper of M'Lellan, that he swore, if ever he fell in with Lisa in the Indian country, he would shoot him on the spot ; a mode of redress perfectly in unison with the character of the man, and the code of honor prevalent beyond the frontier. If Crooks and M'Lellan had been exasperated by the inso lent conduct of the Sioux Tetons, and the loss which it had occasioned, those freebooters had been no less indignant at being outwitted by the white men, and disappointed of their anticipated gains, and it was apprehended they would be par ticularly hostile against the present expedition, when they should learn that these gentlemen were engaged in it. All these causes of uneasiness were concealed as much as possible from the Canadian voyageurs, lest they should be come intimidated ; it was impossible, however, to prevent the rumors brought by the Indians from leaking out, and they became subjects of gossiping and exaggeration. The chief of the Omahas, too, on returning from a hunting excursion, reported that two men had been killed some distance above, by a band of Sioux. This added to the fears that already began to be excited. The voyageurs pictured to themselves bands of fierce warriors stationed along each bank of the river, by whom they would be exposed to be shot down in their boats : or lurking hordes, who would set on them at"], [189, "181 DEPARTURE FROM THE OMAHA VILLAGE. night, and massacre them in their encampments. Some lost heart, and proposed to return, rather than fight their way, and, in a manner, run the gauntlet through the country of these piratical marauders. In fact, three men deserted while at this village. Luckily, their place was supplied by three others who happened to be there, and who were prevailed on to join the expedition by promises of liberal pay, and by being fitted out and equipped in complete style. The irresolution and discontent visible among some of his people, arising at times almost to mutiny, and the occasional desertions which took place while thus among friendly tribes, and within reach of the frontiers, added greatly to the anxie ties of Mr. Hunt, and rendered him eager to press forward and leave a hostile tract behind him, so that it would be as perilous to return as to keep on, and no one would dare to desert. Accordingly, on the 15th of May he departed from the vil lage of the Omahas, and set forward towards the country of the formidable Sioux Tetons. For the first five days they had a fair and fresh breeze, and the boats made good pro gress. The wind then came ahead, and the river beginning to rise, and to increase in rapidity, betokened the commence ment of the annual flood, caused by the melting of the snow on the Rocky mountains, and the vernal rains of the upper prairies. As they were now entering a region where foes might be lying in wait on either bank, it was determined, in hunting for game, to confine themselves principally to the islands, which sometimes extend to considerable length, and are beautifully wooded, affording abundant pasturage and shade. On one of these they killed three buffaloes and two elks, and, halting on the edge of a beautiful prairie, made a sumptuous hunter's 16"], [190, "182 TWO wandering trappers. repast. They had not long resumed their boats and pulled along the river banks, when they descried a canoe approach ing, navigated by two men, whom, to their surprise, they ascertained to be white men. They proved to be two of those strange and fearless wanderers of the wilderness, the trappers. Their names were Benjamin Jones and Alexander Carson. They had been for two years past hunting and trap ping near the head of the Missouri and were thus floating for thousands of miles in a cockle shell, down a turbulent stream, through regions infested by savage tribes, yet apparently as easy and unconcerned as if navigating securely in the midst of civilization. The acquisition of two such hardy, experienced and daunt less hunters was peculiarly desirable at the present moment. They needed but little persuasion. The wilderness is the home of the trapper ; like the sailor, he cares but little to whioh point of the compass he steers ; and Jones and Carson readily abandoned their voyage to St. Louis, and turned their faces towards the Rocky mountains and the Pacific. The two naturalists, Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Nuttall, who had joined the expedition at St. Louis, still accompanied it, and pursued their researches on all occasions. Mr. Nuttall seems to have been exclusively devoted to his scientific pursuits. He was a zealous botanist, and all his enthusiasm was awakened at beholding a new world, as it were, opening upon him in the boundless prairies, clad in the vernal and variegated robe of unknown flowers. Whenever the boats landed at meal times, or for any temporary purpose, he would spring on shore and set out on a hunt for new specimens. Every plant or flower of a rare or unknown species was eagerly seized as a prize. Delighted with the treasures spreading themselves out before him, he went groping and stumbling along among a wilderness"], [191, "183 ardor of a botanist. of sweets, forgetful of every thing but his immediate pursuit, and had often to be sought after when the boats were about to resume their course. At such times he would be found far off in the prairies, or up the course of some petty stream laden with plants of all kinds. The Canadian voyageurs, who are a class of people that know nothing out of their immediate line, and with constitu tional levity make a jest of any thing they cannot understand, were extremely puzzled by this passion for collecting what they considered mere useless weeds. When they saw the worthy botanist coming back heavy laden with his specimens, and treasuring them up as carefully as a miser would his hoard, they used to make merry among themselves at his expense, regarding him as some whimsical kind of madman. Mr. Bradbury was less exclusive in his tastes and habits, and combined the hunter and sportsman with the naturalist. He took his rifle or his fowling piece with him in his geological researches, conformed to the hardy and rugged habits of the men around him, and of course gained favor in their eyes. He had a strong relish for incident and adventure, was curious in observing savage manners, and savage life, and ready to join any hunting or other excursion. Even now, that the expedi tion was proceeding through a dangerous neighborhood, he could not check his propensity to ramble. Having observed, on the evening of the 22d of May, that the river ahead made a great bend which would take up the navigation of the follow ing day, he determined to profit by the circumstance. On the morning of the 22d, therefore, instead of embarking, he filled his shot pouch with parched corn, for provisions, and set off to cross the neck on foot and meet the boats in the afternoon at the opposite side of the bend. Mr. Hunt felt uneasy at. his venturing thus alone, and reminded him that he was in an"], [192, "184 ADVENTURE WITH AN INDIAN. enemy's country ; but Mr. Bradbury made light of the danger, and started off cheerily upon his ramble. His day was passed pleasantly in traversing a beautiful tract, making botanical and geological researches, and observing the habits of an extensive village of prairie dogs, at which he made several ineffectual shots, without considering the risk he run of attracting the attention of any savages that might be lurking in the neighbor hood. In fact he had totally forgotten the Sioux Tetons, and all the perils of the country, when, about the middle of the afternoon, as he stood near the river bank, and was looking out for the boat, he suddenly felt a hand laid on his shoulder. Starting and turning round, he beheld a naked savage with a bow bent, and the arrow pointed at his breast. In an instant his gun was levelled and his hand upon tbe lock. The Indian drew his bow still further, but forbore to launch the shaft. Mr. Bradbury, with admirable presence of mind, reflected that the savage, if hostile in his intents, would have shot him with out giving him a chance of defence ; he paused, therefore, and held out his hand. The other took it in sign of friendship, and demanded in the Osage language whether he was a Big Knife, or American. He answered in the affirmative, and in quired whether the other were a Sioux. To his great relief he found that he was a Ponca. By this time two other Indians came running up, and all three laid hold of Mr. Brad bury and seemed disposed to compel him to go off with them among the hills. He resisted, and sitting down on a sand hill contrived to amuse them with a pocket compass. When the novelty of this was exhausted they again seized him, but he now produced a small microscope. This new wonder again fixed the attention of the savages, who have far more curiosity than it has been the custom to allow them. While thus en gaged, one of them suddenly leaped up and gave a war-whoop."], [193, "UNWELCOME MISSIVES. 185 The hand of the hardy naturalist was again on his gun and he was prepared to make battle when the Indian pointed down the river and revealed the true cause of his yell. It was the mast of one of the boats appearing above the low willows which bordered the stream. Mr. Bradbury felt infinitely re lieved by the sight. The Indians on their part now showed signs of apprehension, and were disposed to run away ; but he assured them of good treatment and something to drink if they would accompany him on board of the boats. They lingered for a time, but disappeared before the boats came to land. On the following morning they appeared at the camp accom panied by several of their tribe. With them came also a white man, who announced himself as a messenger bearing missives for Mr. Hunt. In fact he brought a letter from Mr. Manuel Lisa, partner and agent of the Missouri Fur Company. As has already been mentioned, this gentleman was going in search of Mr. Henry and his party, who had been dislodged from the forks of the Missouri by the Blackfeet Indians, and, had shifted his post somewhere beyond the Rocky mountains. Mr. Lisa had left St. Louis three weeks after Mr. Hunt, and having heard of the hostile intentions of the Sioux, had made the greatest exertions to overtake him, that they might pass through the dangerous part of the river together. He had twenty stout oarsmen in his service, and they plied their oars so vigorously, that he had reached the Omaha village just four days after the departure of Mr. Hunt. From this place he despatched the messenger in question, trusting to his over taking the barges as they toiled up against the stream, and were delayed by the windings of the river. The purport of his letter was to entreat Mr. Hunt to wait until he could come up with him, that they might unite their forces and be a pro tection to each other in their perilous course through the 16*"], [194, "186 A BAFFLING REPLY. country of the Sioux. In fact, as it was afterwards ascer tained, Lisa was apprehensive that Mr. Hunt would do him some ill office with the Sioux bands, securing his own passage through their country by pretending that he with whom they were accustomed to trade, was on his way to them with a plentiful supply of goods. He seared, too, that Crooks and M'Lellan would take this opportunity to retort upon him the perfidy which they accused him of having used, two years previously among these very Sioux. In this respect, how ever, he did them signal injustice. There was no such thing as covert design or treachery in their thought ; but M'Lellan, when he heard that Lisa was on his way up the river, renewed his open threat of shooting him the moment he met him on Indian land. The representations made by Crooks and M'Lellan of the treachery they had experienced, or fancied, on the part of Lisa, had great weight with Mr. Hunt, especially when he recollected the obstacles that had been thrown in his own way by that gentleman at St. Louis. He doubted, therefore, the fair dealing of Lisa, and feared that, should they enter the Sioux country together, the latter might make use of his influence with that tribe, as he had in the case of Crooks and M'Lel lan, and instigate them to oppose his progress up the river. He sent back, therefore, an answer calculated to beguile Lisa, assuring him that he would wait for him at the Poncas village, which was but a little distance in advance ; but, no sooner had the messenger departed, than he pushed forward with all diligence, barely stopping at the village to procure a supply of dried buffalo meat, and hastening to leave the other party as far behind as possible, thinking there was less to be apprehended from the open hostility of Indian foes, than from the quiet strategy of an Indian trader."], [195, "187 CAMP GOSSIP.

It was about noon when the party left the Poncas village, about a league beyond which they passed the mouth of the Quicourt, or Rapid river, (called, in the original French, TEau Qui Court.) After having proceeded some distance further, they landed, and encamped for the night. In the evening camp, the voyageurs gossiped, as usual, over the events of the day ; and especially over intelligence picked up among the Poncas. These Indians had confirmed the previous reports of the hostile intentions of the Sioux, and had assured them that five tribes, or bands, of that fierce nation were actually assembled higher up the river, and waiting to cut them off. This evening gossip, and the terrific stories of Indian warfare to which it gave rise, produced a strong effect upon the imaginations of the irresolute ; and on the morning it was dis covered that the two men, who had joined the party at the Maha village, and been so bounteously fitted out, had deserted in the course of the night, carrying with them all their equip ments. As it was known that one of them could not swim, it"], [196, "188 KENTUCKY HUNTERS AFLOAT. was hoped that the banks of the Quicourt river would bring them to a halt. A general pursuit was therefore instituted, but without success. On the following morning, (May 26th) as they were all on shore, breakfasting on one of the beautiful banks of the river, they observed two canoes descending along the opposite side. By the aid of spyglasses, they ascertained that there were two white men in one of the canoes, and one in the other. A gun was discharged, which called the attention of the voy agers, who crossed over. They proved to be three Kentucky hunters, of the true \"dreadnought\" stamp. Their names were Edward Robinson, John Hoback, and Jacob Rizner. Robin son was a veteran backwoodman, sixty-six years of age. He had been one of the first settlers of Kentucky, and engaged in many of the conflicts of the Indians on \" The Bloody Ground.\" In one of these battles he had been scalped, and he still wore a handkerchief bound round his head to protect the part. These men had passed several years in the upper wilderness. They had been in the service of the Missouri Company under Mr. Henry, and had crossed the Rocky mountains with him in the preceding year, when driven from his post on the Mis souri by the hostilities of the Blackfeet. After crossing the mountains, Mr. Henry had established himself on one of the head branches of the Columbia river. There they had remained with him for some months, hunting and trapping, until, haring satisfied their wandering propensities, they felt disposed to return to the families and comfortable homes which they had left in Kentucky. They had accordingly made their way back across the mountains, and down the rivers, and were in full career for St. Louis, when thus sud denly interrupted. The sight of a powerful party of traders, trappers, hunters, and voyageurs, well armed and equipped,"], [197, "189 DANGER FROM THE BLACKFEET. furnished at all points, in high health and spirits, and banquet ing lustily on the green margin of the river, was a spectacle equally stimulating to these veteran backwoodmen with the glorious array of a campaigning army to an old soldier ; but when they learned the grand scope and extent of the enter prise in hand, it was irresistible : homes and families, and all the charms of green Kentucky vanished from their thoughts ; they cast loose their canoes to drift down the stream, and joyfully enlisted in the band of adventurers. They engaged on similar terms with some of the other hunters. The com pany was to fit them out, and keep them supplied with the requisite equipments and munitions, and they were to yield one half of the produce of their hunting and trapping. The addition of three such staunch recruits was extremely acceptable at this dangerous part of the river. The knowl edge of the country wliich they had acquired, also, in their journeys aud bunting excursions along the rivers and among the Rocky mountains, was all important ; in fact, the informa tion derived from them induced Mr. Hunt to alter his future course. He had hitherto intended to proceed by the route taken by Lewis and Clarke in their famous exploring expedi tion, ascending the Missouri to its forks, and thence going, by land, across the mountains. These men informed him, however, that on taking that course he would have to. pass through the country infested by the savage tribe of the Black feet, and would be exposed to their hostilities ; they being, as has already been observed, exasperated to deadly animosity against the whites, on account of the death of one of their tribe by the hands of Captain Lewis. They advised him rather to pursue a route more to the southward, being the same by which they had returned. This would carry them over the mountains about where the head waters of the Platte and the"], [198, "190 A CHANGE OF PLAN. Yellowstone take their rise, at a place much more easy and practicable than that where Lewis and Clarke had crossed. In pursuing this course, also, he would pass through a country abounding with game, where he would have a better chance of procuring a constant supply of provisions than by the other route, and would run less risk of molestation from the Black- feet. Should he adopt this advice, it would be better for him to abandon the river at the Aricara town, at which he would arrive in the course of a few days. As the Indians of that town possessed horses in abundance, he might purchase a sufficient number of them for his great journey overland, which would commence at that place. After reflecting on this advice, and consulting with his associates, Mr. Hunt came to the determination to follow the route thus pointed out, in which the hunters engaged to pilot him. The party continued their voyage with delightful May weather. The prairies bordering on the river were gayly painted with innumerable flowers, exhibiting the motley con fusion of colors of a Turkey carpet. The beautiful islands also, on which they occasionally halted, presented the appear ance of mingled grove and garden. The trees were often covered with clambering grape vines in blossom, which per fumed the air. . Between the stately masses of the groves were grassy lawns and glades, studded with flowers, or inter spersed with rose bushes in full bloom. These islands were often the resort of the buffalo, the elk, and the antelope, who had made innumerable paths among the trees and thickets, which had the effect of the mazy walks and alleys of parks and shrubberies. Sometimes, where, the river passed between high banks and bluffs, the roads, made by the tramp of buffa loes for many ages along the face of the heights, looked like"], [199, "191 IRON ORE A LAND OF DANGER. so many well travelled highways. At other places, the banks were banded with great veins of iron ore, laid bare by the abrasion of the river. At one place the course of the river was nearly in a straight line for about fifteen miles. The banks sloped gently to its margin, without a single tree, but bordered with grass and herbage of a vivid green. Along each bank, for the whole fifteen miles, extended a stripe, one hundred yards in breadth, of a deep rusty brown, indicating an inexhaustible bed of iron, through the centre of which the Missouri had worn its way. Indications of the continuance of this bed were afterwards observed higher up the river. It is, in fact, one of the mineral magazines which nature has provided in the heart of this vast realm of fertility, and which, in connexion with theMmmense beds of coal on the same river, seem garnered up as the elements of the future wealth and power of the mighty west. The sight of these mineral treasures greatly excited the curiosity of Mr. Bradbury, and it was tantalizing to him to be checked in his scientific researches, and obliged to forego his usual rambles on shore ; but they were now entering the fated country of the Sioux Tetons, in which it was dangerous to wander about unguarded. This country extends for some days' journey along the river, and consists of vast prairies, here and there diversified by swelling hills, and cut up by ravines, the channels of turbid streams in the rainy seasons, but almost destitute of water during the heats of summer. Here and there, on the sides of the hills, or along the alluvial borders and bottoms of the ravines, are groves and skirts of forest ; but for the most part the country presented to the eye a boundless waste, covered with herbage, but without trees. The soil of this immense region is strongly impregnated"], [200, "192 APPREHENSIONS OF THE VOYAGEURS. with sulphur, copperas, alum, and glauber salts; its various earths impart a deep tinge to the streams which drain it, and these, with the crumbling of the banks along the Missouri, give to the waters of that river much of the coloring matter with which they are clouded. Over this vast tract the roving bands of the Sioux Tetons hold their vagrant sway; subsisting by the chase of the buf falo, tbe elk, the deer, and the antelope, and waging ruthless warfare with other wandering tribes. As the boats made their way up the stream bordered by this land of danger, many of the Canadian voyageurs, whose fears had been awakened, would regard with a distrustful eye the boundless waste extending on each side. All, how ever, was silent, and apparently untenanted by a human being. Now and then a herd of deer would be seen feeding tranquilly among the flowery herbage, or a line of buffaloes, like a cara van on its march, moving across the distant profile of the prairie. The Canadians, however, began to apprehend an ambush in every thicket, and to regard the broad, tranquil plain as a sailor eyes some shallow and perfidious sea, which, though smooth and safe to the eye, conceals the lurking rock or treacherous shoal. The very name of a Sioux became a watchword of terror. Not an elk, a wolf, or any other animal, could appear on the hills, but the boats resounded with exclamations from stem to stern, \" voila les Sioux '.\" \" voila les Sioux .'\" (there are the Sioux ! there are the Sioux!) Whenever it was practicable, the night encamp ment was on some island in the centre of the stream. On the morning of the 31st of May, as the travellers were breakfasting on the right bank of the river, the usual alarm was given, but with more reason, as two Indians actually made their appearance on a bluff on the opposite or northeast"], [201, "193 INDIAN SCOUTS. side, and harangued them in a loud voice. As it was impos sible at that distance to distinguish what they said, Mr. Hunt, after breakfast, crossed the river with Pierre Dorion, the interpreter, and advanced boldly to converse with them, while the rest remained watching, in mute suspense, the movements of the parties. As soon as Mr. Hunt landed, one of the Indians disappeared behind the hill, but shortly reappeared on horseback, and went scouring off across the heights. Mr. Hunt held some conference with the remaining savage, and then recrossed the river to his party. These two Indians proved to be spies or scouts of a large war party encamped about a league off, and numbering two hundred and eighty lodges, or about six hundred warriors, of three different tribes of Sioux ; the Yangtons Ahna, the Te tons Bois-brul6, and the Tetons Min-na-kine-azzo. They expected daily to be reinforced by two other tribes, and had been waiting eleven days for the arrival of Mr. Hunt's party, with a determination to oppose their progress up the river ; being resolved to prevent all trade of the white men with their enemies the Arickaras, Mandans, and Minatarees. The Indian who had galloped off on horseback had gone to give notice of the approach of the party, so that they might now look out for some fierce scenes with those piratical savages, of whom they had received so many formidable accounts. The party braced up their spirits to the encounter, and re-embarking, pulled resolutely up the stream. An island for some time intervened between them and the opposite side of the river ; but on clearing the upper end, they came in full view of the hostile shore. There was a ridge of hills down which the savages were pouring in great numbers, some on horseback, and some on foot. Reconnoitring them with the aid of glasses, thev perceived that they were all in warlike 17"], [202, "194 THREATENED HOSTILITIES. array, painted and decorated for battle. Their weapons were bows and arrows, and a few short carbines, and most of them had round shields. Altogether they had a wild and gallant appearance, and, taking possession of a point which com manded the river, ranged themselves along the bank as if prepared to dispute the passage. At sight of this formidable front of war, Mr. Hunt and his companions held council together. It was plain that the rumors they had heard were correct, and the Sioux were determined to oppose their progress by force of arms. To attempt to elude them and continue along the river was out of the question. The strength of the mid-current was too violent to be withstood, and the boats were obliged to ascend along the river banks. These banks were often high and perpen dicular, affording the savages frequent stations, from whence, safe themselves, and almost unseen, they might shower down their missiles upon the boats below, and retreat at will, with out danger from pursuit. Nothing apparently remained, there fore, but to fight or turn back. The Sioux far outnumbered them, it is true, but their own party was about sixty strong, well armed and supplied with ammunition ; and, beside their guns and rifles, they had a swivel and two howitzers mounted in the boats. Should they succeed in breaking this Indian force by one vigorous assault, it was likely they would be deterred from making any future attack of consequence. The fighting alternative was, therefore, instantly adopted, and the boats pulled to shore nearly opposite to the hostile force. Here thei arms were all examined and put in order. The swivel and howitzers were then loaded with powder and dis charged, to let the savages know by the report how formidably they were provided. The noise echoed along the shores of the river, and must have startled the warriors, who were only"], [203, "AN ARRAY OF BATTLE. 195 accustomed to the sharp reports of rifles. The same pieces were then loaded with as many bullets as they would probably bear; after which the whole party embarked, and pulled across the river. The Indians remained watching them in silence, their painted forms and visages glaring in the sun, and their feathers fluttering in the breeze. The poor Cana dians eyed them with rueful glances, and now and then a fearful ejaculation would escape them. \"Parbleu! this is a sad scrape we are in, brother !\" would one mutter to the next oarsman. \" Aye, aye,\" the other would reply, \" we are not going to a wedding, my friend !\" When the boats arrived within rifle shot, the hunters and other fighting personages on board seized their weapons, and prepared for action. As they rose to fire, a confusion took place among the savages. They displayed their buffalo robes, raised them with both hands above their heads, and then spread them before them on the ground. At sight of this, Pierre Dorion eagerly cried out to the party not to fire, as this movement was a peaceful signal, and an invitation to a parley. Immediately about a dozen of the principal warriors, sepa rating from the rest, descended to the edge of the river, lighted a fire, seated themselves in a semicircle round it, and, display ing the calumet, invited the party to land. Mr. Hunt now called a council of the partners on board of his boat. The question was, whether to trust to the amicable overtures of these ferocious people ? It was determined in the affirmative ; for, otherwise, there was no alternative but to fight them. The main body of the party were ordered to remain on board of the boats, keeping within shot, and prepared to fire in case of any signs of treachery ; while Mr. Hunt and the other part ners (M'Kenzie, Crooks, Miller, and M'Lellan,) proceeded to land, accompanied by the interpreter and Mr. Bradbury. The"], [204, "196 THE PIPE OF PEACE. chiefs who awaited them on the margin of the river, remained seated in their semicircle, without stirring a limb or moving a muscle, motionless as so many statues. Mr. Hunt and his companions advanced without hesitation, and took their seats on the sand so as to complete the circle. The band of war riors who lined the banks above stood looking down in silent groups and clusters, some ostentatiously equipped and deco rated, others entirely naked, but fantastically painted, and all variously armed. The pipe of peace was now brought forward with due cere mony. The bowl was of a species of red stone resembling porphyry ; the stem was six feet in length, decorated with tufts of horse hair dyed red. The pipebearer stepped within the circle, lighted the pipe, held it towards the sun, then towards the different points of the compass, after which he handed it to the principal chief. The latter smoked a few whiffs, then, holding the head of the pipe in his hand, offered the other end to Mr. Hunt, and to each one successively in the circle. When all had smoked, it was considered that an assurance of good faith and amity had been interchanged. Mr. Hunt now made a speech in French, which was inter preted as he proceeded by Pierre Dorion. He informed the Sioux of the real object of the expedition, of himself and his companions, which was, not to trade with any of the tribes up the river, but to across the mountains to the great salt lake in the west, in search of some of their brothers, whom they had not seen for eleven months. That he had heard of the inten tion of the Sioux to oppose his passage, and was prepared, as they might see, to effect it at all hazards : nevertheless, his feelings towards the Sioux were friendly, in proof of which he had brought them a present of tobacco and corn. So saying, he ordered about fifteen carottes of tobacco, and as many bags"], [205, "SPEECH MAKING. 197 of com, to be brought from the boat and laid in a heap near the council fire. The sight of these presents mollified the chieftain, who had doubtless been previously rendered considerate by the resolute conduct of the white men, the judicious disposition of their little armament, the completeness of their equipments, and the compact array of battle which they presented. He made a speech in reply, in which he stated the object of their hostile assemblage, which had been merely to prevent supplies of arms and ammunition from going to the Arickaras, Mandans, and Minatarees, with whom they were at war ; but being now convinced that the party were carrying no supplies of the kind, but merely proceeding in quest of their brothers beyond the mountains, they would not impede them in their voyage. He concluded by thanking them for their present, and advising them to encamp on the opposite side of the river, as he had some young men among his warriors for whose discretion he could not be answerable, and who might be troublesome. Here ended the conference : they all arose, shook hands, and parted. Mr. Hunt and his companions re-embarked, and the boats proceeded on their course unmolested. 17*"], [206, "198 A MEETING OF OLD OPPONENTS. i CHAPTER XIX.

On the afternoon of the following day (June 1st) they arrived at the great bend, where the river winds for about thirty miles round a circular peninsula, the neck of which is not above two thousand yards across. On the succeeding morning, at an early hour, they descried two Indians standing on a high bank of the river, waving and spreading their buffalo robes in signs of amity. They immediately pulled to shore and landed. On approaching the savages, however, the latter showed evident symptoms of alarm, spreading out their arms horizontally, according to their mode of supplicating clemency. The rea son was soon explained. They proved to be two chiefs of the very war party that had brought Messrs. Crooks and M'Lel lan to a stand two years before, and obliged them to escape down the river. They ran to embrace these gentlemen, as if delighted to meet with them ; yet they evidently feared some retaliation of their past misconduct, nor were they quite at ease until the pipe of peace had been smoked."], [207, "199 CAUSES OF INDIAN HOSTILITY. Mr. Hunt having been informed that the tribe to which these men belonged, had killed three white men during the preceding summer, reproached them with the crime and de manded their reasons for such savage hostility. \"We kill white men,\" replied one of the chiefs, \"because white men kill U3. That very man,\" added he, pointing to Carson, one of the new recruits, \" killed one of our brothers last summer. The three white men were slain to avenge his de'ath.\" The chief was correct in his reply. Carson admitted that being with a party of Arickaras on the banks of the Missouri, and seeing a war party of Sioux on the opposite side, he had fired with his rifle across. It was a random shot, made without much expectation of effect, for the river was full half a mile in breadth. Unluckily it brought down a Sioux warrior for whose wanton destruction threefold vengeance had been taken as has been stated. In this way outrages are frequently committed on the natives by thoughtless or mischievous white men ; the Indians retaliate according to a law of their code, which re quires blood for blood ; their act, of what with them is pious vengeance, resounds throughout the land, and is represented as wanton and unprovoked ; the neighborhood is roused to arms ; a war ensues, which ends in the destruction of half the tribe, the ruin of the rest, and their expulsion from their hereditary homes. Such is too often the real history of Indian warfare, which in general is traced up only to some vindictive act of a savage ; while the outrage of the scoundrel white man that provoked it is sunk in silence. The two chiefs, having smoked their pipe of peace and received a few presents, departed well satisfied. In a little while two others appeared on horseback, and rode up abreast of the boats. They had seen the presents given to their comrades, but were dissatisfied with them and came after the"], [208, "200 DANGERS AND PRECAUTIONS. boats to ask for more. Being somewhat peremptory and insolent in their demands, Mr. Hunt gave them a flat refusal and threatened, if they or any of their tribe followed him with similar demands, to treat them as enemies. They turned and rode off in a furious passion. As he was ignorant what force these chiefs might have behind the hills, and as it was very possible they might take advantage of some pass of the river to attack the boats, Mr. Hunt called all stragglers on board and prepared for such emergency. It was agreed that the large boat commanded by Mr. Hunt, should ascend along the northeast side of the river, and the three smaller boats along the south side. By this arrangement each party would com mand a view of the opposite heights above the heads and out of the sight of their companions, and could give the alarm should they perceive any Indians, lurking there. The signal of alarm was to be two shots fired in quick succession. The boats proceeded for the greater part of the day without seeing any signs of an enemy. About four o'clock in the afternoon the large boat, commanded by Mr. Hunt, came to where the river was divided by a long sand bar, which appar ently, however, left a sufficient channel between it and the shore along which they were advancing. He kept up this channel, therefore, for some distance until the water proved too shallow for the boat. It was necessary, therefore, to put about, return down the channel, and pull round the lower end of the sand bar into the main stream. Just as he had given orders to this effect to his men, two signal guns were fired from the boats on the opposite side of the river. At the same moment a file of savage warriors was observed pouring down from the impending bank and gathering on the shore at the lower end of the bar. They were evidently a war party, being armed with bows and arrows, battle clubs and carbines,"], [209, "AN INDIAN WAR PARTY. 201 and round bucklers of buffalo hide, and their naked bodies were painted with black and white stripes. The natural in ference was that they belonged to the two tribes of Sioux which had been expected by the great war party, and that they had been invited to hostility by the two chiefs who had been enraged by the refusal and the menace of Mr. Hunt. Here then was a fearful predicament. Mr. Hunt and his crew seemed caught as it were in a trap. The Indians, to the number of about a hundred, had already taken possession of a point near which the boat would have to pass : others kept pouring down the bank, and it was probable that some would remain posted on the top of the height. The hazardous situation of Mr. Hunt was perceived by those in the other boats and they hastened to his assistance. They were at some distance above the sand bar, however, and on the opposite side of the river, and saw, with intense anxiety, the number of savages continually augmenting, at the lower end of the channel, so that the boat would be exposed to a fearful attack before they could render it any assistance. Their anxiety increased as they saw Mr. Hunt and his party descending the channel and dauntlessly approaching the point of danger ; but it suddenly changed into surprise on beholding the boat pass close by the savage horde unmolested, and steer out safely into the broad river. The next moment the whole band of warriors was in motion. They ran along the bank until they were opposite to the boats, then throwing by their weapons and buffalo robes, plunged into the river, waded and swam off to the boats and surrounded them in crowds, seeking to shake hands with every individual on board, for the Indians have long since found this to be the white man's token of amity, and they carry it to an extreme."], [210, "202 A FRIENDLY' ENCAMPMENT. All uneasiness was now at an end. The Indians proved to be a war party of Arickaras, Mandans and Minnetarees, con sisting of three hundred warriors, and bound on a foray against the Sioux. Their war plans were abandoned for the present, and they determined to return to the Arickara town, where they hoped to obtain from the white men arms and ammunition that would enable them to take the field with advantage over their enemies. The boats now sought the first convenient place for encamp ing. The tents were pitched ; the warriors fixed their camp at about a hundred yards distant ; provisions were furnished from the boats sufficient for all parties ; there was hearty though rude feasting in both camps, and in the evening the red warriors entertained their white friends with dances and songs, that lasted until after midnight. On the following morning (July 3) the travellers re-embark ed, and took a temporary leave of their Indian friends, who intended to proceed immediately for the Arickara town, where they expected to arrive in three days, long before the boats could reach there. Mr. Hunt had not proceeded far before the chief came galloping along the shore and made signs for a parley. He said, his people could not go home satisfied unless they had something to take with them to prove that they had met with the white men. Mr. Hunt understood the drift of the speech, and made the chief a present of a cask of powder, a bag of balls, and three dozen of knives, with which he was highly pleased. While the chief was receiving these presents an Indian came running along the shore and an nounced that a boat, filled with white men, was coming up the river. This was by no means agreeable tidings to Mr. Hunt, who correctly concluded it to be the boat of Mr. Manuel Lisa, and he was vexed to find that alert and adventurous trader"], [211, "203 APPROACH OF LISA. upon his heels, whom he had hoped to have out man\u0153uvred, and left far behind. Lisa, however, was too much experi enced in the wiles of Indian trade to be lulled by the promise of waiting for him at the Poncas village ; on the contrary, he had allowed himself no repose, and had strained every nerve to overtake the rival party, and availing himself of the moonlight, had even sailed during a considerable part of the night. In this he was partly prompted by his apprehensions of the Sioux, having met a boat which had probably passed Mr. Hunt's party in the night, and which had been fired into by these savages. On hearing that Lisa was so near at hand, Mr. Hunt perceived that it was useless to attempt any longer to evade him; after proceeding a few miles further, therefore, he came to a halt and waited for him to come up. In a little while the barge of Lisa made its appearance. It came sweeping gently up the river, manned by its twenty stout oarsmen, and armed by a swivel mounted at the bow. The whole number on board amounted to twenty-six men ; among whom was Mr. Henry Brackenridge, then a young, enterprising man ; who was a mere passenger, tempted by notions of curiosity to ac company Mr. Lisa. He has since made himself known by various writing, among which may be noted a narrative of this very voyage. The approach of Lisa, while it was regarded with uneasi ness by Mr. Hunt, roused the ire of M'Lellan ; who calling to mind old grievances, began to look round for his rifle, as if he really intended to carry his threat into execution and shoot him on the spot ; and it was with some difficulty that Mr. Hunt was enabled to restrain his ire, and prevent a scene of outrage and confusion."], [212, "204 MEETING BETWEEN OLD RIVALS. The meeting between the two leaders, thus mutually dis trustful, could not be very cordial ; and as to Messrs. Crooks and M'Lellan, though they refrained from any outbreak, yet they regarded in grim defiance their old rival and underplotter. In truth, a general distrust prevailed throughout the party con cerning Lisa and his intentions. They considered him artful and slippery, and secretly anxious for the failure of their expe dition. There being now nothing more to be apprehended from the Sioux, they suspected that Lisa would take advantage of his twenty-oared barge to leave them and get first among the Arickaras. As he had traded with those people and possessed great influence over them, it was feared he might make use of it to impede the business of Mr. Hunt and his party. It was resolved, therefore, to keep a sharp look out upon his move ments ; and M'Lellan swore that if he saw the least sign of treachery on his part, he would instantly put his old threat into execution. Notwithstanding these secret jealousies and heart-burnings, the two parties maintained an outward appearance of civility, and for two days continued forward in company with some degree of harmony. On the third day, however, an explosion took place, and it was produced by no less a personage than Pierre Dorion, the half-breed interpreter. It will be recol lected that this worthy had been obliged to steal a march from St. Louis, to avoid being arrested for an old whiskey debt which he owed to the Missouri Fur Company, and by which Mr. Lisa had hoped to prevent his enlisting in Mr. Hunt's ex pedition. Dorion, since the arrival of Lisa, had kept aloof and regarded him with a sullen and dogged aspect. On the fifth of July the two parties were brought to a halt by a heavy rain, and remained encamped about a hundred yards apart. In the course of the day Lisa undertook to tamper with the faith of"], [213, "205 THE RAGE OF PIERRE DORION. Pierre Dorion, and, inviting him on board of his boat, regaled him with his favorite whiskey. When he thought him suffi- ciently mellowed, he proposed to him to quit the service of his new employers and return to his old allegiance. Finding him not to be moved by soft words, he called to mind his old debt to the company, and threatened to carry him off by force, in pay- ment of it. The mention of this debt always stirred up the gall of Pierre Dorion, bringing with it the remembrance of the whiskey extortion. A violent quarrel arose between him and Lisa, and he left the boat in high dudgeon. His first step was to repair to the tent of Mr. Hunt and reveal the attempt that had been made to shake his faith. While he was yet talking Lisa entered the tent, under the pretext of coming to borrow a towiug line. High words instantly ensued between him and Dorion, which ended by the half-breed's dealing him a blow. A quarrel in the \" Indian country,\" however, is not to be set- tled with fisticuffs. Lisa immediately rushed to his boat for a weapon. Dorion snatched up a pair of pistols belonging to Mr. Hunt, and placed himself in battle array. The noise had roused the camp, and every one pressed to know the cause. Lisa now reappeared upon the field with a knife stuck in his girdle. Mr. Breckenridge, who had tried in vain to mollify his ire, accompanied him to the scene of action. Pierre Dori on's pistols gave him the advantage, and he maintained a most warlike attitude. In the meantime, Crooks and M'Lellan had learnt the cause of the affray, and were each eager to take the quarrel into their own hands. A scene of uproar and hubbub ensued that defies description. M'Lellan would have brought his rifle into play and settled all old and new grudges by a pull of the trigger, had he not been restrained by Mr. Hunt. That gentleman acted as moderator, endeavoring to prevent a gen eral melee ; in the midst of the brawl, however, an expres- 18"], [214, "A GRAUD MELEE PREVENTED. 206 sion was made use of by Lisa derogatory to his own honor. In an instant, the tranquil spirit of Mr. Hunt was in a flame. He now became as eager for fight as any one on the ground, and challenged Lisa to settle the dispute on the spot with pistols. Lisa repaired to his boat to arm himself for the deadly feud. He was followed by Messrs. Bradbury and Breckenridge, who, novices in Indian life and the \" chivalry\" of the frontier, had no relish for scenes of blood and brawl. By their earnest mediation the quarrel was with great difficulty brought to a close without bloodshed ; b\\it the two leaders of the rival camps separated in anger, and all personal inter course ceased between them."], [215, "FEATURES OF THE WILDERNESS. 207 CHAPTER XX.

The rival parties now coasted along the opposite sides of the river, within sight of each other ; the barges of Mr. Hunt always keeping some distance in the advance, lest Lisa should push on and get first to the Arickara village. The scenery and objects, as they proceeded, gave evidence that they were advancing deeper and deeper into the domains of savage nature. Boundless wastes kept extending to the eye, more and more animated by herds of buffalo. Sometimes these unwieldy animals were seen moving in long procession across the silent landscape ; at other times they were scattered about, singly or in groups, on the broad enamelled prairies and green acclivities, some cropping the rich pasturage, others reclining amidst the flowery herbage ; the whole scene realizing in a manner the old scriptural descriptions of the vast pastoral countries of the Orient, with \" cattle upon a thousand hills.\" At one place the shores seemed absolutely lined with buffaloes ; many were making their way across the stream"], [216, "208 ANTELOPES THEIR HABITS. snorting, and blowing, and floundering. Numbers, in spite of every effort, were borne by the rapid current within shot of the boats, and several were killed. At another place a num ber were descried on the beach of a small island, under the shade of the trees, or standing in the water, like cattle, to avoid the flies and the heat of the day. Several of the best marksmen stationed themselves in the bow of a barge which advanced slowly and silently, stemming the current with the aid of a broad sail and a fair breeze. The buffalo stood gazing quietly at the barge as it approached, perfectly unconscious of their danger. The fattest of the herd was selected by tbe hunters, who all fired together and brought down their victim. Beside the buffaloes they saw abundance of deer, and frequent gangs of stately elks, together with light troops of sprightly antelopes, the fleetest and most beautiful inhabitants ff the prairies. There are two kinds of antelopes in these regions, one nearly the size of the common deer, the other not much larger than a goat. Their color is a light gray, or rather dun, slightly spotted with white ; and they have small horns like those of the deer, which they never shed. Nothing can surpass the delicate and elegant finish of their limbs, in which lightness, elasticity, and strength, are wonderfully combined. All the attitudes and movements of this beautiful animal are graceful and picturesque ; and it is altogether as fit a subject for the fanciful uses of the poet, as the oft sung gazelle of the east. Their habits are shy and capricious ; they keep on the open plains, are quick to take the alarm, and bound away with a fleetness that defies pursuit. When thus skimming across a prame in the autumn, their light gray or dun color blends with the hue of the withered herbage, the swiftness of their motion"], [217, "EXPLOIT OF JOHN DAY. 209 baffles the eye, and they almost seem unsubstantial forms, driven like gossamer before the wind. While they thus keep to the open plain and trust to their speed, they are safe ; but they have a prurient curiosity that sometimes betrays them to their ruin. When they have scud for some distance and left their pursuer behind, they will sud denly stop and turn to gaze at the object of their alarm. If the pursuit is not followed up they will, after a time, yield to their inquisitive hankering, and return to the place from whence they have been frightened. John Day, the veteran hunter already mentioned, displayed ms experience and skill in entrapping one of these beautiful animals. Taking advantage of its well known curiosity, he laid down flat among the grass, and putting his handkerchief on the end of his ramrod, waved it gently in the air. This had the effect of the fabled fascination of the rattle snake The antelope gazed at the mysterious object for some time at a distance, then approached timidly, pausing and reconnoi tring with increased curiosity ; moving round the point of attraction in a circle, but still drawing nearer and nearer, until, being within the range of the deadly rifle, he fell a victim to his curiosity. On the 10th of June, as the party were making brisk pro gress with a fine breeze, they met a canoe with three Indians descending the river. 'They came to a parley, and brought news from the Arickara village. The war party, which had caused such alarm at the sand bar, had reached the village some days previously, announced the approach of a party of traders, and displayed with great ostentation the presents they had received from them. On further conversation with these three Indians, Mr. Hunt learnt the real danger which he had run, when hemmed up within the sand bar. The Mandans 18*"], [218, "210 AN EMBASSY NEGOTIATIONS. who were of the war party, when they saw the boat so com pletely entrapped and apparently within their power, had been eager for attacking it, and securing so rich a prize. The Minatarees, also, were nothing loth, feeling in some measuro committed in hostility to the whites, in consequence of their tribe having killed two white men above the fort of the Mis souri Fur Company. Fortunately, the Arickaras who formed the majority of the war party, proved true in their friendship to the whites and prevented any hostile act, otherwise a bloody affray, and perhaps a horrible massacre, might have ensued. On the 11th of June, Mr. Hunt and his companions en camped near an island about six miles below the Arickara village. Mr. Lisa encamped, as usual, at no great distance ; but the same sullen and jealous reserve, and non-intercourse continued between them. Shortly after pitching the tents, Mr. Breckenridge made his appearance as an ambassador from the rival camp. He came on behalf of his companions, to arrange the manner of making their entrance into the village and of receiving tbe chiefs ; for every thing of the kind is a matter of grave ceremonial among the Indians. The partners now expressed frankly their deep distrust of the intentions of Mr. Lisa, and their apprehensions, that, out of the jealousy of trade, and resentment of recent disputes, he might seek to instigate the Arickaras against them. Mr. Brecken ridge assured them that their suspicions were entirely ground less, and pledged himself that nothing of the kind should take place. He found it difficult, however, to remove their distrust ; the conference, therefore, ended without producing any cordial understanding ; and M'Lellan recurred to his old threat of shooting Lisa the instant he discovered any thing like treachery in his proceedings. That night the rain fell in torrents, accompanied by thunder"], [219, "211 TWO CHIEFS AND A CREOLE INTERPRTER. and lightning. The camp was deluged, and the bedding and baggage drenched. All hands embarked at an early hour, and set forward for the village. About nine o'clock, when half way, they met a canoe, on board of which were two Arickara dignitaries. One, a fine looking man, much above the common size, was hereditary chief of the village ; he was called the Lefthanded, on account of a personal peculiarity. The other, a ferocious looking savage, was the war chief, or generalissimo ; he was known by the name of the Big Man, an appellation he well deserved from his size, for he was of a gigantic frame. Both were of fairer complexion than is usual with savages. They were accompanied by an interpreter ; a French creole ; one of those haphazard wights of Gallic origin, who abound upon our frontier, living among the Indians like one of their own race. He had been twenty years among the Arickaras, had a squaw and a troop of piebald children, and officiated as interpreter to the chiefs. Through this worthy organ the two dignitaries signified to Mr. Hunt their sovereign intention to oppose the further progress of the expedition up the river unless a boat were left to trade with them. Mr. Hunt, in reply, explained the object of his voyage, and his intention of debarking at their village and proceeding thence by land ; and that he would willingly trade with them for a supply of horses for his journey. With this explanation they were perfectly satisfied, and putting about, steered for their village to make preparations for the reception of the strangers. The village of the Rikaras, Arickaras, or Ricarees, for the name is thus variously written, is between the 46th and 47th parallels of north latitude, and fourteen hundred and thirty miles above the mouth of the Missouri. The party reached it about ten o'clock in the morning, but landed on the opposite"], [220, "212 THE ARICKARA VILLAGE. side of the river, where they spread out their baggage and effects to dry. From hence they commanded an excellent view of the village. It was divided into two portions, about eighty yards apart, being inhabited by two distinct bands. The whole extended about three quarters of a mile along the river bank, and was composed of conical lodges, that looked like so many small hillocks, being wooden frames intertwined with osier, and covered with earth. The plain beyond the village swept up into hills of considerable height, but the whole country was nearly destitute of trees. While they were re- garding the village, they beheld a singular fleet coming down the river. It consisted of a number of canoes, each made of a single buffalo hide stretched on sticks, so as to form a kind of circular trough. Each one was navigated by a single squaw, who knelt in the bottom and paddled ; towing after her frail bark a bundle of floating wood intended for firing. This kind of canoe is in frequent use among the Indians ; the buffalo hide being readily made up into a bundle and transported on horseback ; it is very serviceable in conveying baggage across the rivers. The great number of horses grazing around the village, and scattered over the neighboring hills and valleys, bespoke the equestrian habits of the Arickaras, who are admirable horse men. Indeed, in the number of his horses consists the wealth of an Indian of the prairies ; who resembles an Arab in his passion for this noble animal, and in his adroitness in the management of it. After a time, the voice of the sovereign chief, \" the Left handed,\" was heard across the river, announcing that the council lodge was preparing, and inviting the white men to come over. The river was half a mile in width, yet every word uttered by the chieftain was heard ; this may be partly"], [221, "213 LANDING AT THE VILLAGE. attributed to the distinct manner in which every syllable of the compound words in the Indian languages is articulated and accented ; but in truth, a savage warrior might often rival Achilles himself for force of lungs* Now came the delicate, point of management ; how the two rival parties were to conduct their visit to the village with proper circumspection and due decorum. Neither of the leaders had spoken to each other since their quarrel. All com munication had been by ambassadors. Seeing the jealousy entertained of Lisa, Mr. Breckenridge, in his negociation, had arranged that a deputation from each party should cross the river at the same time, so that neither would have the first access to the ear of the Arickaras. The distrust of Lisa, however, had increased in proportion as they approached the sphere of action, and M'Lellan in particular, kept a vigilant eye upon his motions, swearing to shoot him if he attempted to cross the river first. About two o'clock the large boat of Mr. Hunt was manned, and he stepped on board, accompanied by Messrs. M'Kenzie and M'Lellan ; Lisa at the same time embarked in his barge ; the two deputations amounted in all to fourteen persons, and never was any movement of rival potentates conducted with more wary exactness. They landed amidst a rabble crowd, and were received on the bank by the lefthanded chief, who conducted them into the village with grave courtesy ; driving to the right and left the swarms of old squaws, imp-like boys, and vagabond dogs, with wliich the place abounded. They wound their way between the cabins which looked like dirt-heaps huddled together without any plan, and surrounded by old palisades ; all filthy in the extreme, and redolent of villanous smells. * Bradbury. P. 110."], [222, "214 THE COUNCIL LODGE. At length they arrived at the council lodge. It was some what spacious, and formed of four forked trunks of trees placed upright, supporting cross beams and a frame of poles inter woven with osiers, and the whole covered with earth. A hole sunken in the centre formed the fireplace, and immediately above was a circular hole in the apex of the lodge, to let out the smoke and let in the daylight. Around the lodge were recesses for sleeping, like the berths on board ships, screened from view by curtains of dressed skins. At the upper end of the lodge was a kind of hunting and warlike trophy con sisting of two buffalo heads garishly painted, surmounted by shields, bows, quivers of arrows, and other weapons. On entering the lodge the chief pointed to mats or cushions which had been placed around for the strangers, and on which they seated themselves, while he placed himself on a kind of stool. An old man then came forward with the pipe of peace or good fellowship, lighted and banded it. to the chief, and then falling back, squatted himself near the door. The pipe was passed from mouth to mouth, each one taking a whiff, which is equivalent to the inviolable pledge of faith, of taking salt together among the ancient Britons. The chief then made a sign to the old pipebearer, who seemed to fill, likewise, the station of herald, seneschal, and public crier, for he ascended to the top of the lodge to make procla mation. Here he took his post beside the aperture for the emission of smoke, and the admission of light ; the chief dictated from within what he was to proclaim, and he bawled it forth with a force of lungs that resounded over all the village. In this way he summoned the warriors and great men to council ; every now and then reporting progress to his chief through the hole in the roof. In a little while the braves and sages began to enter one"], [223, "215 THE SPEECH OF LISA. by one as their names were called or announced, emerging from under the buffalo robe suspended over the entrance instead of a door, stalking across the lodge to the skins placed on the floor and crouching down on them in silence. In this way twenty entered and took their seats, forming an assem blage worthy of the pencil ; for the Arickaras are a noble race of men, large and well formed, and maintain a savage grandeur and gravity of demeanor in their solemn ceremonials. All being seated, the old seneschal prepared the pipe of ceremony or council and having lit it, handed it to the chief. He inhaled the sacred smoke, gave a puff upward to the heaven, then downward to the earth, then towards the east ; after this it was as usual passed from mouth to mouth, each holding it respectfully until his neighbor had taken several whiffs ; and now the grand council was considered as opened in due form. The chief made an harangue welcoming the white men to his village, and expressing his happiness in taking them by the hand as friends ; but at the same time complaining of the poverty of himself and his people ; the usual prelude among Indians to begging or hard bargaining. Lisa rose to reply, and the eyes of Hunt and his com panions were eagerly turned upon him, those of M'Lellan glaring like a basilisks. He began by the usual expressions of friendship, and then proceeded to explain the object of his own party. Those persons, however, said he, pointing to Mr. Hunt and his companions, are of a different party, and are quite distinct in their views ; but, added he, though we are separate parties we make but one common cause when the safety of either is concerned. Any injury or insult offered to them I shall consider as done to myself, and will resent it accordingly. I trust, therefore, that you will treat them with the same"], [224, "216 HONEST EXPEDIENT OF THE GRAY EYES. friendship that you have always manifested for me, doing every thing in your power to serve them and to help them on their way. The speech of Lisa, delivered with an air of frankness and sincerity, agreeably surprised and disappointed the rival party. Mr. Hunt then spoke declaring the object of his journey to the great Salt lake beyond the mountains, and that he should want horses for the purpose, for which he was ready to trade. having brought with him plenty of goods. Both he and Lisa concluded their speeches by making presents of tobacco. The lefthanded chieftain in reply promised his friendship and aid to the new comers, and welcomed them to his village. He added that they had not the number of horses to spare that Mr. Hunt required, and expressed a doubt whether they should be able to part with any. Upon this, another chief tain, called Gray Eyes, made a speech and declared that they could readily supply Mr. Hunt with all the horses he might want, since, if they had not enough in the village, they could easily steal more. This honest expedient immediately removed the main difficulty ; but the chief deferred all trading for a day or two, until he should have time to consult with his subordinate chiefs, as to market rates ; for the principal chief of a village, in conjunction with his council, usually fixes the prices at which articles shall be bought and sold, and to them the village must conform. The council now broke up. Mr. Hunt transferred his camp across the river at a little distance below the village and the lefthanded chief placed some of his warriors as a guard to prevent the intrusion of any of his people. The camp was pitched on the river bank just above the boats. The tents and the men wrapped in their blankets and bivouacking on skins in the open air, surrounded the baggage at night. Four"], [225, "217 HARMONY IN THE CAMP. sentinels also kept watch within sight of each other outside of the camp until midnight, when they were relieved by four others who mounted guard until daylight. Mr. Lisa encamped near to Mr. Hunt, between him and the village. The speech of Mr. Lisa in the council had produced a pacific effect in the encampment. Though the sincerity of his friendship and good will towards the new company still re mained matter of doubt, he Was no longer suspected of ar intention to play false. The intercourse between the tw< leaders was, therefore, resumed, and the affairs of both partie: went on harmoniously. 1"], [226, "218 AN INDIAN HORSE FAIR. CHAPTER XXI.

A trade now commenced with the Arickaras under the regu lation and supervision of their two chieftains. Lisa sent a part of his goods to the lodge of the lefthanded dignitary, and Mr. Hunt established his mart in -the lodge of the Big Man. The village soon presented the appearance of a busy fair ; and as horses were in demand, the purlieus and the adjacent plain were like the vicinity of a Tartar encampment ; horses were put through all their paces, and horsemen were careering about with that dexterity and grace for which the Arickaras are noted. As soon as a horse was purchased, his tail was crop ped, a sure mode of distinguishing him from the horses of the tribe ; for the Indians disdain to practise this absurd, barba rous, and indecent mutilation, invented by some mean and vulgar mind, insensible to the merit and perfections of the animal. On the contrary, the Indian horses are suffered to"], [227, "INDIAN HORSES. 219 remain in every respect the superb and beautiful animals which nature formed them. The wealth of an Indian of the far west consists principally in his horses, of which each chief and warrior possesses a great number, so that the plains about an Indian village or encampment are covered with them. These form objects of traffic, or objects of depredation, and in this way pass from tribe to tribe over great tracts of country. The horses owned by the Arickaras are, for the most part, of the wild stock of the prairies ; some, however, had been obtained from the Pon cas, Pawnees, and other tribes to the southwest, who had stolen them from the Spaniards in the course of horse-stealing expeditions into the Mexican territories. These were to be known by being branded ; a Spanish mode of marking horses not practised by the Indians As the Arickaras were meditating another expedition against their enemies the Sioux, the articles of traffic most in demand were guns, tomahawks, scalping knives, powder, ball, and other munitions of war. The price of a horse, as regulated by the chiefs, was commonly ten dollars worth of goods at first cost. To supply the demand thus suddenly created, par ties of young men and braves had sallied forth on expeditions to steal horses ; a species .of service among the Indians which takes precedence of hunting, and is considered a department of honorable warfare. While the leaders of the expedition were actively engaged in preparing for the approaching journey, those who had ac companied it for curiosity or amusement, found ample matter for observation in the village and its inhabitants. Wherever they went they were kindly entertained. If they entered a lodge, the buffalo robe was spread before the fire for them to sit down ; the pipe was brought, and while the master of the"], [228, "220 DOMESTIC LIFE OF AN INDIAN. lodge conversed with his guests, the squaw put the earthen vessel over the fire, well filled with dried buffalo meat and pounded corn ; for the Indian in his native state, before he has mingled much with white men, and acquired their sordid habits, has the hospitality of the Arab .* never does a strange; enter his door without having food placed before him ; ant never is the food thus furnished made a matter of traffic. The life of an Indian when at home in his village is a life of indolence and amusement. To the woman is consigned the labors of the household and the field ; she arranges the lodge; brings wood for the fire ; cooks; jerks venison and buffalo meat ; dresses the skins of the animals killed in the chase ; cultivates the little patch of maize, pumpkins, and pulse, which furnishes a great part of their provisions. Their time for repose and recreation is at sunset, when the labors of the clay being ended, they gather together to amuse themselves with petty games, or to hold gossiping convocations on the tops of their lodges. As to the Indian, he is a game animal, not to be degraded by useful or menial toil. It is enough that he exposes him self to the hardships of the chase and the perils of war ; that he brings home food for his family, and watches and fights for its protection. Every thing else is beneath his attention. When at home, he attends only to his weapons and his horses, preparing the means of suture exploit. Or he engages with his comrades in games of dexterity, agility and strength ; or in gambling games in which every thing is put at hazard, with a recklessness seldom witnessed in civilized life. A great part of the idle leisure of the Indians when at home, is passed in groups, squatted together on the bank of a river, on the top of a mound on the prairie, or on the roof of one of their earth-covered lodges, talking over the news of the day,"], [229, "RUMORS OF LURKING FOES. 221 the affairs of the tribe, the events and exploits of their last hunting or fighting expedition ; or listening to the stories of old times told by some veteran chronicler ; resembling a group of our village quidnuncs and politicians, listening to the pro sings of some superannuated oracle, or discussing the contents of an ancient newspaper. As to the Indian women, they are far from complaining of their lot. On the contrary, they would despise their husbands could they stoop to any menial office, and would think it con veyed an imputation upon their own conduct. It is the worst insult one virago can cast upon another in a moment of alter cation. \"Infamous woman!\" will she cry, \"I have seen your husband carrying wood into his lodge to make the fire Where was his squaw, that he should be obliged to make a woman of himself!\" Mr. Hunt and his fellow travellers had not been many days at the Arickara village, when rumors began to circulate that the Sioux had followed them up, and that a war party, four or five hundred in number, were lurking somewhere in the neighbor hood. These rumors produced much embarrassment in the camp. The white hunters were deterred from venturing forth in quest of game, neither did the leaders think it proper to ex pose them to such risk. The Arickaras, too, who had suffered greatly in their wars with this cruel and ferocious tribe, were roused to increased vigilance, and stationed mounted scouts upon the neighboring hills. This, however, is a general pre caution among the tribes of the prairies. Those immense plains present a horizon like the ocean, so that any object of importance can be descried afar, and information communi cated to a great distance. The scouts are stationed on the hills, therefore, to look out both for game and for enemies, and are, in a manner, living telegraphs conveying their intelligence 19*"], [230, "222 A SALLYING FORTH. by concerted signs. If they wish to give notice of a herd of buffalo in the plain beyond, they gallop backwards and for wards abreast, on the summit of the hill. If they perceive an enemy at hand, they gallop to and fro, crossing each other ; at sight of which, the whole village flies to arms. Such an alarm was given in the afternoon of the 15th. Four scouts were seen crossing and recrossing each other at full gallop, on the summit of a hill about two miles distant down the river. The cry was up that the Sioux were coming. In an instant the village was in an uproar. Men, women and children were all brawling and shouting ; dogs barking, yelp ing and howling. Some of the warriors ran for the horses to gather and drive them in from the prairie, some for their weapons. As fast as they could arm and equip they sallied forth ; some on horseback, some on foot. Some hastily ar rayed in their war dress, with coronets of fluttering feathers, and their bodies smeared with paint ; others naked and only furnished with the weapons they had snatched up. The women and children gathered on the tops of the lodges and heightened the confusion of the scene by their vociferation. Old men who could no longer bear arms took similar stations, and harangued the warriors as they passed, exhorting them to valorous deeds. Some of the veterans took arms them selves, and sallied forth with tottering steps. In this way, the savage chivalry of the village to the number of five hun dred, poured forth, helter skelter, riding and running, with hideous yells and war-whoops, like so many bedlamites or demoniacs let loose. After a while the tide of war rolled back, but with far less uproar. Either it had been a false alarm, or the enemy had re treated on finding themselves discovered, and quiet was restored to the village. The white hunter continuing to be fearful of"], [231, "223 INDIAN DOGS TRIUMPHANT HORSE STEALERS. ranging this dangerous neighborhood, fresh provisions began to be scarce in the camp. As a substitute, therefore, for venison and buffalo meat, the travellers had to purchase a number of dogs to be shot and cooked for the supply of the camp. Fortunately, however chary the Indians might be of their horses, they were liberal of their dogs. In fact, these animals swarm about an Indian village as they do about a Turkish town. Not a family but has two or three dozen belonging to it, of all sizes and colors ; some, of a superior breed, are used for hunting ; others, to draw the sledge, while others, of a mongrel breed, and idle vagabond nature, are fattened for food. They are supposed to be descended from the wolf, and retain something of his savage but cowardly temper, howling rather than barking ; showing their teeth and snarling on the slightest provocation, but sneaking away on the least attack. The excitement of the village continued from day to day. On the day following the alarm just mentioned, several parties arrived from different directions, and were met and conducted by some of the braves to the council lodge, where they re ported the events and success of their expeditions, whether of war or hunting ; which news was afterwards promulgated throughout the village, by certain old men who acted as heralds or town criers. Among the parties which arrived was one that had been among the Snake nation stealing horses, and returned crowned with success. As they passed in triumph through the village they were cheered by the men, women, and children, collected as usual on the tops of the lodges, and were exhorted by the Nestors of the village to be generous in their dealings with the white men. The evening was spent in feasting and rejoicing among the relations of the successful warriors ; but sounds of grief and"], [232, "224 DEPARTURE OF CHEYENNES. wailing were heard from the hills adjacent to the village : the lamentations of women who had lost some relative in the foray. An Indian village is subject to continual agitations and excitements. The next day arrived a deputation of braves from the Cheyenne or Shienne nation ; a broken tribe, cut up, like the Arickaras, by wars with the Sioux, and driven to take refuge among the Black hills, near the sources of the Cheyenne river, from which they derive their name. One of these deputies was magnificently arrayed in a buffalo robe, on which various figures were fancifully embroidered with split quills dyed red and yellow ; and the whole was fringed with the slender hoofs of young fawns, that rattled as he walked. The arrrival of this deputation was the signal for another of those ceremonials which occupy so much of Indian life ; for no being is more courtly and punctilious, and more observ ant of etiquette and formality than an American savage. The object of the deputation was to give notice of an intended visit of the Shienne (or Cheyenne) tribe to the Arickara village in the course of fifteen days. To this visit Mr. Hunt looked forward, to procure additional horses for his joumey ; all his bargaining being ineffectual in obtaining a sufficient supply from the Arickaras. Indeed nothing could prevail upon the latter to part with their prime horses, which had been trained to buffalo hunting. As Mr. Hunt would have to abandon his boats at this place, Mr. Lisa now offered to purchase them, and such of his merchandise as was superfluous, and to pay him in horses, to be obtained at a fort belonging to the Missouri Fur Company situated at the Mandan villages, about a hundred and fifty miles further up the river. A bargain was promptly made,"], [233, "225 RETURN OF A WAR PARTY. and Mr. Lisa and Mr. Crooks, with several companions, set out for the fort to procure the horses. They returned, after upwards of a fortnight's absence, bringing with them the stipu lated number of horses. Still the cavalry was not sufficiently numerous to convey the party and the baggage and merchan dise, and a few days more were required to complete the arrangements for the journey. On the 9th of July, just before daybreak, a great noise and vociferation was heard in the village. This being the usual Indian hour of attack and surprise, and the Sioux being known to be in the neighborhood, the camp was instantly on the alert. As the day broke Indians were descried in considerable number on the bluffs, three or four miles down the river. The noise and agitation in the village continued. The tops of the lodges were crowded with the inhabitants, all earnestly looking towards the hills, and keeping up a vehement chatter ing. Presently an Indian warrior galloped past the camp towards the village, and in a little while the legions began to pour forth. The truth of the matter was now ascertained. The Indians upon the distant hills were three hundred Arickara braves, returning from a foray. They had met the war party of Sioux who had been so long hovering about the neighborhood, had fought with them the day before, killed several, and defeated the rest with the loss of but two or three of their own men and about a dozen wounded ; and they were now halting at a distance until their comrades in the village should come forth to meet them, and swell the parade of their tri umphal entry. The warrior who had galloped past the camp was the leader of the party hastening home to give tidings of his victory. Preparations were now made for this great martial cere"], [234, "226 ARICKARA DRESS INDIAN TOIL*.. mony. All the finery and equipments of the warriors were sent forth to them, that they might appear to the greatest advantage. Those, too, who had remained at home, tasked their wardrobes and toilets to do honor to the procession. The Arickaras generally go naked, but, like all savages, they have their gala dress of which they are not a little vain. This usually consists of a gay surcoat and leggings of the dressed skin of the antelope, resembling chamois leather, and embroidered with porcupine quills brilliantly dyed. A buffalo robe is thrown over the right shoulder, and across the left is slung a quiver of arrows. They wear gay coronets of plumes, particularly those of the swan ; but the feathers of the black eagle are considered the most worthy, being a sacred bird among the Indian warriors. He who has killed an enemy in his own land, is entitled to drag at his heels a fox-skin attached to each moccasin ; and he who has slain a grizzly bear, wears a necklace of his claws, the most glorious trophy that a hunter can exhibit. An Indian toilet is an operation of some toil and trouble ; the warrior often has to paint himself from head to foot, and is extremely capricious and difficult to please, as to the hideous distribution of streaks and colors. A great part of the morning, therefore, passed away before there were any signs of the distant pageant. In the meantime a profound stillness reigned over the village. Most of the inhabitants had gone forth ; others remained in mute expectation. All sports and occupations were suspended, excepting that in the lodges the painstaking squaws were silently busied preparing the repasts for the warriors. It was near noon that a mingled sound of voices and rude music faintly heard from a distance, gave notice that the pro cession was on the march. The old men and such of the"], [235, "TRIUMPHANT PROCESSION. 227 squaws as could leave their employments hastened forth to meet it. In a little wliile it emerged from behind a hill, and had a wild and picturesque appearance as it came moving over the summit in measured step, and to the cadence of songs and savage instruments ; the warlike standards and trophies flaunting aloft, and the feathers, and paint, and silver orna ment of the warriors glaring and glittering in the sunshine. The pageant had really something chivalrous in its arrange ment. The Arickaras are divided into several bands, each bearing the name of some animal or bird, as the buffalo, the bear, the dog, the pheasant. The present party consisted of four of these bands, one of which was the dog, the most esteemed in war, being composed of young men under thirty, and noted for prowess. It is engaged on the most desperate occasions. The bands marched in separate bodies under their several leaders. The warriors on foot came first, in platoons of ten or twelve abreast ; then the horsemen. Each band bore as an ensign a spear or bow decorated with beads, porcupine quills and painted feathers. Each bore its trophies of scalps, elevated on poles, their long black locks streaming in the wind. Each was accompanied by its rude music and minstrelsy. In this way the procession extended nearly a quarter of a mile. The warriors were variously armed, some few with guns, others with bows and arrows, and war clubs, all had shields of buffalo hide, a kind of defence generally used by the Indians of the open prairies, who have not the covert of trees and forests to protect them. They were painted in the most savage style. Some had the stamp of a red hand across their mouths, a sign that they had drunk the lifeblood of a foe ! As they drew near to the village the old men and the women began to meet them, and now a ocene ensued that"], [236, "228 THE YOUNG WARRIOR AND HIS MOTHER. proved the fallacy of the old fable of Indian apathy and stoicism. Parents and children, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters met with the most rapturous expressions of joy ; while waitings and lamentations were heard from the relatives of the killed and wounded. The procession, however, con tinued on with slow and measured step, in cadence to the solemn chaunt, and the warriors maintained their fixed and stern demeanor. Between two of the principal chiefs rode a young warrior who had distinguished himself in the battle. He was severely wounded, so as with difficulty to keep on his horse ; but he preserved a serene and steadfast countenance, as if perfectly unharmed. His mother had heard of his condition. She broke through the throng, and rushing up, threw her arms around him and wept aloud. He kept up the spirit and demeanor of a warrior to the last, but expired shortly after he had reached his home. The village was now a scene of the utmost festivity and triumph. The banners, and trophies, and scalps, and painted shields were elevated on poles near the lodges. There were war-feasts, and scalp-dances, with warlike songs and savage music ; all the inhabitants were arrayed in their festal dresses ; while the old heralds went round from lodge to lodge, pro mulgating with loud voices the events of the battle and the exploits of the various warriors. Such was the boisterous revelry of the village ; but sounds of another kind were heard on the surrounding hills ; piteous waitings of the women, who had retired thither to mourn in darkness and solitude for those who had fallen in battle. There the poor mother of the youthful warrior who had returned home in triumph but to die, gave full vent to the anguish of a mother's heart.

While Mr. Hunt was diligently preparing for his arduous journey, some of his men began to lose heart at the perilous prospect before them ; but, before we accuse them of want of spirit, it is proper to consider the nature of the wilderness into which they were about to adventure. It was a region almost as vast and trackless as the ocean, and, at the time of which we treat, but little known, excepting through the vague accounts of Indian hunters. A part of their route would lay across an immense tract stretching north and south for hundreds of miles along the foot of the Rocky mountains, and drained by the tributary streams of the Missouri and the Mississippi. This region, which resembles one of the im measurable steppes of Asia, has not inaptly been termed \"the great American desert.\" It spreads forth into undulating and treeless plains, and desolate sandy wastes, wearisome to the eye from their extent and monotony, and which are supposed by geologists, to have formed the ancient floor of the ocean,"], [239, "PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS. 231 countless ages since, when its primeval waves beat against the granite bases of the Rocky mountains. It is a land where no man permanently abides ; for, in certain seasons of the year there is no food either for the hunter or his steed. The herbage is parched and withered ; the brooks and streams are dried up ; the buffalo, the elk and deer have wandered to distant parts, keeping within the verge of expiring verdure, and leaving behind them avast uninhabited solitude, seamed by ravines, the beds of former torrents, but now serving only to tantalize and increase the thirst of the traveller. Occasionally the monotony of this vast wilderness is inter rupted by mountainous belts of sand and limestone, broken into confused masses ; with precipitous cliffs aud yawning ravines, looking like the ruins of a world ; or is traversed by lofty and barren ridges of rock, almost impassable, like those denominated the Black hills. Beyond these rise the stern barriers of the Rocky mountains, the limits, as it were, of the Atlantic world. The rugged defiles and deep valleys of this vast chain form sheltering places for restless and ferocious bands of savages, many of them the remnants of tribes, once inhabitants of the prairies, but broken up by war and violence, and who carry into their mountain haunts the fierce passions and reckless habits of desperadoes. Such is the nature of this immense wilderness of the far west ; which apparently defies cultivation, and the habitation of civilized life. Some portions of it along the rivers may partially be subdued by agriculture, others may form vast pastoral tracts, like those of the east ; but it is to be feared that a great part of it will form a lawless interval between the abodes of civilized man, like the wastes of the ocean or the deserts of Arabia; and, like them, be subject to the"], [240, "232 FUTURE PEOPLE OF THE PRAIRIES. depredations of the marauder. Here may spring up new and mongrel races, like new formations in geology, the amalgama tion of the \" debris\" and \" abrasions\" of former races, civilized and savage ; the remains of broken and almost extinguished tribes ; the descendants of wandering hunters and trappers ; of fugitives from the Spanish and American frontiers ; of adventurers and desperadoes of every class and country, yearly ejected from the bosom of society into the wilderness. We are contributing incessantly to swell this singular and hetero geneous cloud of wild population that is to hang about our frontier, by the transfer of whole tribes of savages from the east of the Mississippi to the great wastes of the far west. Many of these bear with them the smart of real or fancied injuries ; many consider themselves expatriated beings, wrong fully exiled from their hereditary homes, and the sepulchres of their fathers, and cherish a deep and abiding animosity against the race that has dispossessed them. Some may gradually become pastoral hordes, like those rude and mi gratory people, half shepherd, half warrior, who, with their flocks and herds, roam the plains of upper Asia ; but, others, it is to be apprehended, will become predatory bands, mounted on the fleet steeds of the prairies, with the open plains for their marauding grounds, and the mountains for their retreats and lurking places. Here they may resemble those great hordes of the north ; \" Gog and Magog with their bands,\" that haunted the gloomy imaginations of the prophets. \" A great company and a mighty host, all riding upon horses, and warring upon those nations which were at rest, and dwelt peaceably, and had gotten cattle and goods.\" The Spaniards changed the whole character and habits of the Indians when they brought the horse among them.

Are we not in danger of producing some such state of things in the boundless regions of the far west . That these are not mere fanciful and extravagant suggestions we have sufficient proofs in the dangers already experienced by the traders to the Spanish mart of Santa Fe\\ and to the distant posts of the fur companies. These are obliged to proceed in armed caravans, and are subject to murderous attacks from bands of Pawnees, Camanches and Blackfeet, that come scouring upon them in their weary march across the plains, or lie in wait for them among the passes of the mountains. We are wandering, however, into excursive speculations, when our intention was merely to give an idea of the nature of the wilderness which Mr. Hunt was about to traverse ; and which at that time was far less known than at present ; though it still remains in a great measure an unknown land. We cannot be surprised, therefore, that some of the least resolute of his party should feel dismay at the thoughts of adventuring into this perilous wilderness under the uncertain guidance of three hunters, who had merely passed once through the country and might have forgotten the landmarks. Their apprehensions were aggravated by some of Lisa's followers, who, not being engaged in the expedition, took a mischievous pleasure in exaggerating its dangers. They painted in strong colors, to the poor Canadian voyageurs, the risk they would run of perishing with hunger and thirst ; of being cut off by war-parties of the Sioux who scoured the plains ; of having their horses stolen by the Upsarokas or Crows, who infested the skirts of the Rocky mountains ; or of being butchered by the Blackfeet, who lurked among the defiles. In a word, 20*"], [242, "234 * EDWARD ROSE, THE INTERPRETER. there was little chance of their getting alive across the moun tains ; and even if they did, those three guides knew nothing of the howling wilderness that lay beyond. The apprehensions thus awakened in the minds of some of the men came well nigh proving detrimental to the expe dition. Some of them determined to desert, and to make their way back to St. Louis. They accordingly purloined several weapons and a barrel of gunpowder, as ammunition for their enterprise, and buried them in the river bank, intending to seize one of the boats and make off in the night. Fortunately their plot was overheard by John Day, the Kentuckian, and communicated to the partners, who took quiet and effectual means to frustrate it. The dangers to be apprehended from the Crow Indians had not been overrated by the camp gossips. These savages, through whose mountain haunts the party would have to pass, were noted for daring and excursive habits, and great dexterity in horse stealing. Mr. Hunt, therefore, considered himself fortunate in having met with a man who might be of great use to him in any intercourse he might have with the tribe. This was a wandering individual named Edward Rose, whom he had picked up somewhere on the Missouri \u2014 one of those anomalous beings found on the frontier, who seem to have neither kin nor country. He had lived some time among the Crows, so as to become acquainted with their language and customs ; and was, withal, a dogged, sullen, silent fellow, with a sinister aspect, and more of the savage than the civil ized man in his appearance. He was engaged to serve in general as a hunter, but as guide and interpreter when they should reach the country of the Crows.

With all his exertions, Mr. Hunt had been unable to obtain a sufficient number of horses for the accommodation of all his people. His caval cade consisted of eighty-two horses, most of them heavily laden with Indian goods, beaver traps, ammunition, Indian corn, corn meal and other necessaries. Each of the partners was mounted, and a horse was allotted to the interpreter, Pierre Dorion, for the transportation of his luggage and his two children. His squaw, for the most part of the time, trudged on foot, like the residue of the party ; nor did any of the men show more patience and fortitude than this resolute woman in enduring fatigue and hardship. The veteran trappers and voyageurs of Lisa's party shook their heads as their comrades set out, and took leave of them as of doomed men ; and even Lisa himself, gave it as his opinion, after the travellers had departed, that they would never reach the shores of the Pacific, but would either perish with hunger in the wilderness, or be cut off by the savages."], [244, "236 SUMMER WEATHER OF THE PRAIRIES.

The course taken by Mr. Hunt was at first to the north west, but soon turned and kept generally to the southwest, to avoid the country infested by the Blackfeet. His route took him across some of the tributary streams of the Missouri, and over immense prairies, bounded only by the horizon, and destitute of trees, It was now the height of summer, and these naked plains would be intolerable to the traveller were it not for the breezes which sweep over them during the fervor of the day, bringing with them tempering airs from the distant mountains. To the prevalence of these breezes, and to the want of all leafy covert, may we also attribute the freedom from those flies and other insects so tormenting to man and beast during the summer months, in the lower plains, which are bordered and interspersed with woodland. The monotony of these immense landscapes, also, would be as wearisome as that of the ocean, were it not relieved in some degree by the purity and elasticity of the atmosphere, and the beauty of the heavens. The sky has that delicious"], [245, "CANADIANS IN CAMP CHEERFUL DRUDGES. 237 blue for which the sky of Italy is renowned ; the sun shines with a splendor, unobscured by any cloud or vapor, and a starlight night on the prairies is glorious. This purity and elasticity of atmosphere increases as the traveller approaches the mountains, and gradually rises into the more elevated prairies. On the second day of the journey, Mr. Hunt arranged the party into small and convenient messes, distributing among them the camp kettles. The encampments at night were as before ; some sleeping under tents, and others bivouacking in the open air. The Canadians proved as patient of toil and hardship on the land as on the water ; indeed, nothing could surpass the patience and good-humor of these men upon the march. They were the cheerful drudges of the party, loading and unloading the horses, pitching the tents, making the fires, cooking ; in short, performing all those household and menial offices which the Indians usually assign to the squaws ; and, like the squaws, they left all the hunting and fighting to others. A Canadian has but little affection for the exercise of the rifle. The progress of the party was but slow for the first few days. Some of the men were indisposed ; Mr. Crooks, es pecially, was so unwell that he could not keep on his horse. A rude kind of litter was, therefore, prepared for him, con sisting of two long poles, fixed, one on each side of two horses, with a matting between them, on which he reclined at full length, and was protected from the sun by a canopy of boughs. On the evening of the 23d (July) they encamped on the banks of what they term Big river ; and here we cannot but pause to lament the stupid, common-place, and often ribald names entailed upon the rivers and other features of the great west, by traders and settlers. As the aboriginal tribes of these"], [246, "238 RESTORATION OF INDIAN NAMES. magnificent regions are yet in existence, the Indian names might easily be recovered ; which, beside being in general more sonorous and musical, would remain mementoes of the primitive lords of the soil, of whom in a little while scarce any traces will be left. Indeed, it is to be wished that the whole of our country could be rescued, as much as pos sible, from the wretched nomenclature inflicted upon it, by ignorant and vulgar minds ; and this might be done, in a great degree, by restoring the Indian names, wherever significant and euphonious. As there appears to be a spirit of research abroad in respect to our aboriginal antiquities, we would suggest, as a worthy object of enterprise, a map, or maps, of every part of our country, giving the Indian names wherever they could be ascertained. Whoever achieves such a task worthily, will leave a monument to his own reputation. To return from this digression. As the travellers were now in a country abounding with buffalo, they remained for several days encamped upon the banks of Big river, to obtain a supply of provisions, and to give the invalids time to recruit. On the second day of their sojourn, as Ben Jones, John Day and others of the hunters' were in pursuit of game, they came upon an Indian camp on the open prairie, near to a small stream which ran through a ravine. The tents or lodges were of dressed buffalo skins, sewn together and stretched on tapering pine poles, joined at top, but radiating at bottom, so as to form a circle capable of admitting fifty persons. Numbers of horses were grazing in the neighborhood of the camp, or straying at large in the prairie ; a sight most acceptable to the hunters. After reconnoitring the camp for some time, they ascertained it to belong to a band of Cheyenne Indians, the same that had sent a deputation to the Arickaras. They received the hunters in the most friendly manner; invited"], [247, "239 A CHEYENNE CAMP. them to their lodges, which were more cleanly than Indian lodges are prone to be, and set food before them with true uncivilized hospitality. Several of them accompanied the hunters back to the camp, when a trade was immediately opened. The Cheyennes were astonished and delighted to find a convoy of goods and trinkets thus brought into the very heart of the prairie ; while Mr. Hunt and his companions were overjoyed to have an opportunity of obtaining a further supply of horses from these equestrian savages. During a fortnight that the travellers lingered at this place, their encampment was continually thronged by the Cheyennes. They were a civil, well-behaved people, cleanly in their per sons and decorous in their habits. The men were tall, straight and vigorous, with aqueline noses, and high cheek bones. Some were almost as naked as ancient statues, and might have stood as models for a statuary ; others had leggins and moccasins of deer skin, and buffalo robes, which they threw gracefully over their shoulders. In a little while, however, they began to appear in more gorgeous array, tricked out in the finery obtained from the white men ; bright cloths ; brass rin^s ; beads of various colors, and happy was he who could render himself hideous with vermilion. The travellers had frequent occasion to admire the skill and grace with which these Indians managed their horses. Some of them made a striking display when mounted ; themselves and their steeds decorated in gala style ; for the Indians often bestow more finery upon their horses than upon themselves. Some would hang round the necks, or rather on the breasts of their horses, tbe most precious ornaments they had obtained from the white men ; others interwove feathers in their manes and tails. The Indian horses, too, appear to have an attach ment to their wild riders, and indeed it is said that the horses"], [248, "240 CHEYENNES, THEIR HABITS AND HISTORY. of the prairies readily distinguish an Indian from a white man by the smell, and give a preference to the former. Yet the Indians, in general, are hard riders, and, however they may value their horses, treat them with great roughness and neg lect. Occasionally the Cheyennes joined the white hunters in pursuit of the elk and buffalo ; and when in the ardor of the chase, spared neither themselves nor their steeds, scouring the prairies at full speed, and plunging down precipices and frightful ravines that threatened the necks of both horse and horseman. The Indian steed, well trained to the chase, seems as mad as his rider, and pursues the game as eagerly as if it were his natural prey, on the flesh of which he was to banquet. The history of the Cneyennes is that of many of those wandering tribes of the prairies. They were the remnant of a once powerful people called the Shaways, inhabiting a branch of the Red river which flows into Lake Winnipeg. Every Indian tribe has some rival tribe with which it wages implacable hostility. The deadly enemies of the Shaways were the Sioux, who, after a long course of warfare, proved too powerful for them, and drove them across the Missouri. They again took root near the Warricanne creek, and estab lished themselves there in a fortified village. The Sioux still followed them with deadly animosity ; dis lodged them from their village, and compelled them to take refuge in the Black hills, near the upper waters of the Shey enne or Cheyenne river. Here they lost even their name, and became known among the French colonists by that of the river they frequented. The heart of the tribe was now broken ; its numbers were greatly thinned by their harassing wars. They no longer attempted to establish themselves in any permanent abode that"], [249, "241 FLUCTUATIONS OF SAVAGE LIFE. might be an object of attack to their cruel foes. They gave up the cultivation of the fruits of the earth, and became a wandering tribe, subsisting by the chase, and following the buffalo in its migrations. Their only possessions were horses, which they caught on the prairies, or reared, or captured on predatory incursions into the Mexican territories, as has already been mentioned. With some of these they repaired once a year to the Arickara villages, exchanged them for corn, beans, pumpkins, and arti cles of European merchandise, and then returned into the heart of the prairies. Such are the fluctuating fortunes of these savage nations War, famine, pestilence, together or singly, bring down theii strength and thin their numbers. Whole tribes are rooted up from their native places, wander for a time about these im mense regions, become amalgamated with other tribes, or disappear from the face of the earth. There appears to be a tendency to extinction among all the savage nations ; and this tendency would seem to have been in operation among the aboriginals of this country long before the advent of the white men, if we may judge from the traces and traditions of ancient populousness in regions which were silent and deserted at the time of the discovery ; and from the myste rious and perplexing vestiges of unknown races, predecessors of those found in actual possession, and who must long since have become gradually extinguished or been destroyed. The whole history of the aboriginal population of this country, however, is an enigma, and a grand one \u2014 will it ever be solved 1 21"], [250, "242 NEW DISTRIBUTION OF HORSES.

On the sixth of August the travellers bade farewell to the friendly band of Cheyennes, and resumed their journey. As they had obtained thirty-six additional horses by their recent traffic, Mr. Hunt made a new arrangement. The baggage was made up in smaller loads. A horse was allotted to eacn of the six prime hunters, and others were distributed among the voyageurs, a horse for every two, so that they could ride and walk alternately. Mr. Crooks being still too feeble to mount the saddle, was carried on a litter. Their march this day lay among singular hills and knolls of an indurated red earth, resembling brick, about the bases of which were scattered pumice stones and cinders, the whole bearing traces of the action of fire. In the evening thev encamped on a branch of Big river. They were now out of the tract of country infested by the Sioux, and had advanced such a distance into the interior that Mr. Hunt no longer felt apprehensive of the desertion of anv of his men. He was doomed, however, to experience new cause of anxiety. As he was seated in his tent after night fall, one of the men came to him privately, and informed him"], [251, "243 TREASON IN THE CAMP. that there was mischief brewing in the camp. Edward Rose, the interpreter, whose sinister looks we have already men tioned, was denounced by this secret informer as a designing, treacherous scoundrel, who was tampering with the fidelity of certain of the men, and instigating them to a flagrant piece of treason. In the course of a few days they would arrive at the mountainous district infested by the Upsarokas or Crows, the tribe among which Rose was to officiate as interpreter. His plan was that several of the men should join with him, when in that neighborhood, in carrying off a number of the horses with their packages of goods, and deserting to those savages. He assured them of good treatment among the Crows, the principal chiefs and warriors of whom he knew : they would soon become great men among them, and have the finest women, and the daughters of the chiefs, for wives ; and the horses and goods they carried off would make them rich for life. The intelligence of this treachery on the part of Rose gave much disquiet to Mr. Hunt, for he knew not how far it might be effective among his men. He had already had proofs that several of them were disaffected to the enterprise, and loath to cross the mountains. He knew also that savage life had charms for many of them, especially the Canadians, who were prone to intermarry and domesticate themselves among the Indians. And here a word or two concerning the Crows may be of service to the reader, as they will figure occasionally in the succeeding narration. The tribe consists of four bands, which have their nestling places in fertile, well wooded valleys, lying among the Rocky mountains, and watered by the Big Horse river and its tribu tary streams ; but, though these are properly their homes,"], [252, "244 THE CROW INDIANS. where they shelter their old people, their wives, and their children, the men of the tribe are almost continually on the foray and the scamper. They are, in fact, notorious marau- ders and horsestealers ; crossing and recrossing the moun- tains, robbing on the one side, and conveying their spoils to the other. Hence, we are told, is derived their name, given to them on account of their unsettled and predatory habits ; winging their flight, like the crows, from one side of the mountains to the other, and making free booty of every thing that lies in their way. Horses, however, are the especial objects of their depredations, and their skill and audacity in stealing them are said to be astonishing. This is their glory and delight ; an accomplished horsestealer fills up their idea of a hero. Many horses are obtained by them, also, in barter from tribes in and beyond the mountains. They have an abso- lute passion for this noble animal ; beside which he is with them an important object of traffic. Once a year they make a visit to the Mandans, Minatarees, and other tribes of the Mis- souri, taking with them droves of horses which they exchange for guns, ammunition, trinkets, vermilion, cloths of bright colors, and various other articles of European manufacture. With these they supply their own wants and caprices, and carry on the internal trade for horses already mentioned. The plot of Rose to rob and abandon his countrymen when in the heart of the wilderness, and to throw himself into the hands of a horde of savages, may appear strange and improba ble to those unacquainted with the singular and anomalous characters that are to be found about the borders. This fel low, it appears, was one of those desperadoes of the frontiers outlawed by their crimes, who combine the vices of civilized and savage life, and are ten times more barbarous than the Indians with whom they consort. Rose had formerly be-"], [253, "A DESPERADO OF THE FRONTIER. 245 i longed to one of the gangs of pirates who infested the islands of the Mississippi, plundering boats as they went up and down the river, and who sometimes shifted the scene of their rob beries to the shore, waylaying travellers as they returned by land from New Orleans with the proceeds of their downward voyage, plundering them of their money and effects, and often perpetrating the most atrocious murders. These hordes of villains being broken up and dispersed, Rose had betaken himself to the wilderness, and associated himself with the Crows, whose predatory habits were con genial with his own, had married a woman of the tribe, and, in short, had identified himself with those vagrant savages. Such was the worthy guide and interpreter, Edward Rose. We give his story, however, not as it was known to Mr. Hunt and his companions at the time, but as it has been subse quently ascertained. Enough was known of the fellow and his dark and perfidious character to put Mr. Hunt upon his guard : still, as there was no knowing how far his plans might have succeeded, and as any rash act might blow the mere smouldering sparks of treason into a sudden blaze, it was thought advisable by those with whom Mr. Hunt consulted, to conceal all knowledge or suspicion of the meditated treachery, but to keep up a vigilant watch upon the movements of Rose, and a strict guard upon the horses at night. 21*"], [254, "246 FOSSIL TREES.

The plains over which the travellers were journeying con tinued to be destitute of trees or even shrubs ; insomuch that they had to use the dung of the buffalo for fuel, as the Arabs of the desert use that of the camel. This substitute for fuel is universal among the Indians of these upper prairies, and is said to make a fire equal to that of turf. If a few chips are added, it throws out a cheerful and kindly blaze. These plains, however, had not always been equally desti tute of wood, as was evident from the trunks of trees which the travellers repeatedly met with, some still standing, others lying about in broken fragments, but all in a fossil state, having flourished in times long past. In these singular remains, the original grain of the wood was still so distinct that they could be ascertained to be the ruins of oak trees. Several pieces of the fossil wood were selected by the men to serve as whet stones. In this part of the journey there was no lack of provisions, for the prairies were covered with immense herds of buffalo."], [255, "247 THE LOST HUNTERS. These, in general, are animals of peaceable demeanor, grazing quietly like domestic cattle ; but this was the season when they are in heat, and when the bulls are unusually fierce and pugnacious. There was accordingly a universal restlessness and commotion throughout the plain ; and the amorous herds gave utterance to their feelings in low bellowings that re sounded like distant thunder. Here and there fierce duellos took place between rival enamorados ; butting their huge shagged fronts together, goring each other with their short black horns, and tearing up the earth with their feet in perfect fury. In one of the evening halts, Pierre Dorion, the interpreter, together with Carson and Gardpie, two of the hunters, were missing, nor had they returned by morning. As it was sup posed they had wandered away in pursuit of buffalo, and would readily find the track of the party, no solicitude was felt on their account. A fire was left burning, to guide them by its column of smoke, and the travellers proceeded on their march. In the evening a signal fire was made on a hill ad jacent to the camp, and in the morning it was replenished with fuel so as to last throughout tbe day. These signals are usual among the Indians, to give warnings to each other, or to call home straggling hunters ; and such is the transparency of the atmosphere in those elevated plains, that a slight column of smoke can be discerned from a great distance, particularly in the evenings. Two or three days elapsed, however, with out the reappearance of the three hunters ; and Mr. Hunt slackened his march to give them time to overtake him. A vigilant watch continued to be kept upon the movements of Rose, and of such of the men as were considered doubtful in their loyalty ; but nothing occurred to excite immediate apprehensions. Rose evidently was not a favorite among his"], [256, "248 SIGNAL FIRES. comrades, and it was hoped that he had not been able. to make any real partisans. On the 10th of August they encamped among hills, on the highest peak of which Mr. Hunt caused a huge pyre of pine wood to be made, which soon sent up a great column of flame that might be seen far and wide over the prairies. This fire blazed all night, and was amply replenished at daybreak ; so that the towering pillar of smoke could not but be descried by the wanderers if within the distance of a day's journey. It is a common occurrence in these regions, where the fea tures of the country so much resemble each other, for hunters to lose themselves and wander for many days, before they can find their way back to the main body of their party. In the present instance, however, a more than common solicitude was felt in consequence of the distrust awakened by the sinister designs of Rose. The route now became excessively toilsome over a ridge of steep rocky hills, covered with loose stones. These were intersected by deep valleys, formed by two branches of Big river, coming from the south of west, both of which they crossed. These streams were bordered by meadows, well stocked with buffaloes. Loads of meat were brought in by the hunters ; but the travellers were rendered dainty by profu sion, and would cook only the choice pieces. They had now travelled for several days at a very slow rate, and had made signal fires and left traces of their route at every stage, yet nothing was heard or seen of the lost men. It began to be feared that they might have fallen into the hands of some lurking band of savages. A party numerous as that of Mr. Hunt, with a long train of pack-horses, moving across open plains or naked hills, is discoverable at a great distance by Indian scouts, who spread the intelligence rapidly"], [257, "A BRIBE TO BE HONEST. 249 to various points, and assemble their friends to hang about the skirts of the travellers, steal their horses, or cut off any strag glers from the main body. Mr. Hunt and his companions were more and more sensible how much it would be in the power cf this sullen and daring vagabond Rose, to do them mischief, when they should be come entangled in the defiles of the mountains, with the passes of which they were wholly unacquainted, and which were infested by his freebooting friends, the Crows. There, should he succeed in seducing some of the party into his plans, he might carry off the best horses and effects, throw himself among his savage allies, and set all pursuit at de fiance. Mr. Hunt resolved, therefore, to frustrate the knave, divert him, by management, from his plans, and make it suffi ciently advantageous for him to remain honest. He took occasion, accordingly, in the course of conversation, to inform Rose that, having engaged him chiefly as a guide and inter preter through the country of the Crows, they would not stand in need of his services beyond. Knowing, therefore, his con nexion by marriage with that tribe, and his predilection for a residence among them, they would put no constraint upon his will, but, whenever they met with a party of that people, would leave him at liberty to remain among his adopted breth ren. Furthermore that, in thus parting with him, they would pay him half a year's wages in consideration of his past ser vices, and would give him a horse, three beaver traps, and sundry other articles calculated to set him up in the world. This unexpected liberality, which made it nearly as profita ble and infinitely less hazardous for Rose to remain honest than to play the rogue, completely disarmed him. From that time his whole deportment underwent a change. His brow cleared up and appeared more cheerful ; he left off his sullen,"], [258, "250 THE LITTLE MISSOURI. skulking habits, and made no further attempts to tamper with the faith of his comrades. On the 13th of August Mr. Hunt varied Ids course and inclined westward, in hopes of falling in with the three lost hunters ; who, it was now thought, might have kept to the right hand of Big river. This course soon brought him to a fork of the Little Missouri, about a hundred yards wide, and resembling the great river of the same name in the strength of its current, its turbid water, and the frequency of drift wood and sunken trees. , Rugged mountains appeared ahead, crowding down to the water edge, and offering a barrier to further progress on the side they were ascending. Crossing the river, therefore, they encamped on its northwest bank, where they found good pas turage and buffalo in abundance. The weather was overcast and rainy, and a general gloom pervaded the camp ; the voya geurs sat moping in groupes, with their shoulders as high as their heads, croaking their forebodings, when suddenly towards evening a shout of joy gave notice that the lost men were found. They came slowly lagging into the camp, with weary looks, and horses jaded and way worn. They had, in fact, been for several days incessantly on the move. In their hunting excursion on the prairies they had pushed so far in pursuit of buffalo, as to find it impossible to retrace their steps over plains trampled by innumerable herds ; and were baffled by the monotony of the landscape in their attempts to recall landmarks. They had ridden to and fro until they had almost lost the points of the compass, and become totally bewildered ; nor did they ever perceive any of the signal fires and columns of smoke made by their comrades.

Mr. Hunt and his party were now on the skirts of the Black hills, or Black mountains, as they are sometimes called ; an extensive chain, lying about a hundred miles east of the Rocky mountains, and stretching in a northeast direction from the south fork of the Nebraska, or Platte river, to the great north bend of the Missouri. The Sierra or ridge of the Black hills, in fact, forms the dividing line between the waters of the Missouri and those of the Arkansas and the Mississippi, and gives rise to the Cheyenne, the Little Missouri, and several tributary streams of the Yellowstone. The wild recesses of these hills, like those of the Rocky mountains, are retreats and lurking places for broken and predatory tribes, and it was among them that the remnant of the Cheyenne tribe took refuge, as has been stated, from their conquering enemies, the Sioux."], [261, "THUNDER SPIRITS. 253 The Black hills are chiefly composed of sand stone, and in many places are broken into savage cliffs and precipices, and present the most singular and fantastic forms ; sometimes resembling towns and castellated fortresses. The ignorant inhabitants of plains are prone to clothe the mountains that bound their horizon with fanciful and superstitious attributes Thus the wandering tribes of the prairies who often behold clouds gathering round the summits of these hills, and light- ning flashing, and thunder pealing from them, when all the neighboring plains are serene and sunny, consider them the abode of the genii or thunder spirits, who fabricate storms and tempests. On entering their defiles, therefore, they often hang offerings on the trees, or place them on the rocks, to propitiate the invisible \" lords of the mountains,\" and procure good weather and successful hunting ; and they attach unusual significance to the echoes which haunt the precipices. This superstition may also have arisen, in part, from a natural phenomenon of a singular nature. In the most calm and serene weather, and at all times of the day or night, succes- sive reports are now and then heard among these mountains, resembling the discharge of several pieces of artillery. Similar reports were heard by Messrs. Lewis and Clarke in the Rocky mountains, which they say, were attributed by the Indians to the bursting of the rich mines of silver contained in the bosom of the mountains. In fact these singular explosions have received fanciful explanations from learned men\", and have not been satisfac torily accounted for even by philosophers. They are said to occur frequently in Brazil. Vasconcelles a Jesuit father, describes one which he heard in the Sierra, or mountain region of Piratininga, and which he compares to the dis charges of a park of artillery. The Indians told him that it 22"], [262, "254 SOUNDS IN THE MOUNTAINS. was an explosion of stones. The worthy father had soon a satisfactory proof of the truth of their information, for the very place was found where a rock had burst and exploded from its entrails a stony mass, like a bomb-shell, and of the size of a bull's heart. This mass was broken either in its ejection or its fall, and wonderful was the internal organiza tion revealed. It had a shell harder even than iron ; within which were arranged, like the seeds of a pomegranate, jewels of various colors ; some transparent as crystal ; others of a fine red, and others of mixed hues. The same phenomenon is said to occur occasionally in the adjacent province of Guayra, where stones of the bigness of a man's hand are exploded, with a loud noise, from the bosom of the earth, and scatter about glittering and beautiful fragments that look like precious gems, but are of no value. The Indians of the Orellanna, also, tell of horrible noises heard occasionally in the Paraguaxo, which they consider the throes and groans of the mountain endeavoring to cast forth the precious stones hidden within its entrails. Others have endeavored to account for these discharges of \" mountain artillery\" on humbler principles ; attributiug them to the loud reports made by the disruption and fall of great masses of iock, reverberated and prolonged by the echoes ; others, to the disengagement of hydrogen, produced by subterraneous beds of coal in a state of ignition. In whatever way this singular phenomenon may be accounted fer, the existence of it appears to be well established. It remains one of the lingering mys teries of nature which throw something of a supernatural charm over her wild mountain solitudes ; and we doubt whether the imaginative reader will not rather join with the poor Indian in attributing it to the thunder spirits, or the guardian"], [263, "THE AHSAHTA OR BIGHOR\"N. 255 genii of unseen treasures, than to any common-place physical cause. Whatever might be the supernatural influences among these mountains, the travellers found their physical difficulties hard to cope with. They made repeated attempts to find a passage through, or over the chain, but were as often turned back by impassable barriers. Sometimes a defile seemed to open a practicable path, but it would terminate in some wild chaos of rocks and cliffs, which it was impossible to climb. The animals of these solitary regions were different from those they had been accustomed to. The black-tailed deer would bound up the ravines on their approach, and the bighorn would gaze fearlessly down upon them from some impending preci pice, or skip playfully from rock to rock. These animals are only to be met with in mountainous regions. The former is larger than the common deer, but its flesh is not equally esteemed by hunters. It has very large ears, and the tip of the tail is black, from which it derives its name. The bighorn is so named from its horns ; which are of a great size, and twisted like those of a ram. It is called by some the argali, by others, the ibex, though differing from both of these animals. The Mandans call it the ahsahta, a name much better than the clumsy appellation which it generally bears. Il is of the size of a small elk, or large deer, and of a dun color, excepting the belly and round the tail, where it is white. In its habits it resembles the goat, fre quenting the rudest precipices ; cropping the herbage from their edges ; and like the chamois, bounding lightly and securely among* dizzy heights, where the hunter dares not venture. It is difficult, therefore, to get within shot of it. Ben Jones the hunter, however, in one of the passes of the Black hills, succeeded in bringing down a bighorn from the verge of a"], [264, "256 DISTANT VIEW OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. precipice, the flesh of which was pronounced by the gourmands of the camp to have the flavor of excellent mutton. Baffled in his attempts to traverse this mountain chain, Mr. Hunt skirted along it to the southwest, keeping it on the right ; and still in hope of finding an opening. At an early hour one day, he encamped in a narrow valley on the banks of a beautifully clear but rushy pool ; surrounded by thickets bearing abundance of wild cherries, currants, and yellow and purple gooseberries. While the afternoon's meal was in preparation, Mr. Hunt and Mr. M'Kenzie ascended to the summit of the nearest hill, from whence, aided by the purity and transparency of the evening atmosphere, they commanded a vast prospect on all sides. Below them extended a plain, dotted with innumerable herds of buffalo. Some were lying down among the herbage, others roaming in their unbounded pastures, while many were engaged in fierce contests like those already described, their low bellowings reaching the ear like the hoarse murmurs of the surf on a distant shore. Far off in the west they descried a range of lofty mountains printing the clear horizon, some of them evidently capped with snow. These they supposed to be the Big Horn moun tains, so called from the animal of that name, with which they abound. They are a spur of the great Rocky chain. The hill from whence Mr. Hunt had this prospect was, accord ing to his computation, about two hundred and fifty miles from the Arickara village. On returning to the camp, Mr. Hunt found some uneasiness prevailing among the Canadian voyageurs. In straying among the thickets they had beheld tracks of grizzly bears in every direction ; doubtless attracted thither by the fruit. To their dismay they now found that they had encamped in one of the"], [265, "THE GRIZZLY BEAR. 257 favorite resorts of this dreaded animal. The idea marred all the comfort of the encampment. As night closed, the sur rounding thickets were peopled with terrors ; insomuch that, according to Mr. Hunt, they could not help starting at every little breeze that stirred the bushes. The grizzly bear is the only really formidable quadruped of our continent. He is the favorite theme of the hunters of the far west, who describe him as equal in size to a common cow and of prodigious strength. He makes battle if assailed, and often, if pressed by hunger, is the assailant. If wounded, he becomes furious and will pursue the hunter. His speed exceeds that of a man, but is inferior to that of a horse. In attacking he rears himself on Ids hind legs and springs the length of his body. Wo to horse or rider that comes within the sweep of his terrific claws, which are sometimes nine inches in length, and tear every tiling before them. At the time we are treating of, the grizzly bear was still frequent on the Missouri, and in the lower country, but, like some of the broken tribes of the prairies, he has gradually fallen back before his enemies and is now chiefly to be found in the upland regions, in rugged fastnesses like those of the Black hills and the Rocky mountains. Here he lurks in caverns, or holes which he has digged in the sides of hills, or under the roots and trunks of fallen trees. Like the com mon bear he is fond of fruits, and mast, and roots, the latter of which he will dig up with his fore claws. He is carnivorous also, and will even attack and conquer the lordly buffalo, dragging his huge carcass to the neighborhood of his den, that he may prey upon it at his leisure. The hunters, both white and red men, consider this the most heroic game. They prefer to hunt him on horseback, and will venture so near as sometimes to singe his hair with 22*"], [266, "258 ADVENTURE OF WILLIAM CANNON. the flash of the rifle. The hunter of the grizzly bear, how ever, must be an experienced hand, and know where to aim at a vital part ; for of all quadrupeds, he is the most difficult to be killed. He will receive repeated wounds without flinching, and rarely is a shot mortal unless through the head or heart. That the dangers apprehended from the grizzly bear, at this night encampment, were not imaginary, was proved on the following morning. Among the hired men of the party was one William Cannon, who had been a soldier at one of the frontier posts, and entered into the employ of Mr. Hunt at Mackinaw. He was an inexperienced hunter and a poor shot, for which he was much bantered by his more adroit comrades. Piqued at their raillery, he had been practising ever since he had joined the expedition, but without success. In the course of the present afternoon, he went forth by himself to take a lesson in venerie, and, to his great delight, had the good fortune to kill a buffalo. As he was a considera ble distance from the camp, he cut out the tongue and some of the choice bits, made them into a parcel, and, slinging them on his shoulders by a strap passed round his forehead, as the voyageurs carry packages of goods, set out all glorious for the camp, anticipating a triumph over his brother hunters. In passing through a narrow ravine, he heard a noise behind him, and looking round beheld, lo his dismay, a grizzly bear in full pursuit, apparently attracted by the scent of the meat. Cannon had heard so much of the invulnerability of this tre mendous animal that he never attempted to fire, but, slipping the strap from his forehead, let go the buffalo meat and ran for his life. The bear did not stop to regale himself with the game, but kept on after the hunter. He had nearly overtaken him when Cannon reached a tree, and, throwing down his rifle, scrambled up it. The next instant Bruin was at the foot"], [267, "JOHN DAY AND THE BEAR. 259 of the tree ; but, as this species of bear does not climb, he contented himself with turning the chase into a blockade. Night came on. In the darkness Cannon could not perceive whether or not the enemy maintained his station ; but his fears pictured him rigorously mounting guard. He passed the night, therefore, in the tree, a prey to dismal fancies. In the morning the bear was gone. Cannon warily descended the tree, gathered up his gun, and made the best of his way back to the camp, without venturing to look after his buffalo meat. While on this theme we will add another anecdote of an adventure with a grizzly bear, told of John Day, the Kentucky hunter, but which happened at a different period of the expe dition. Day was hunting in company with one of the clerks of the Company, a lively youngster, who was a great favorite with the veteran, but whose vivacity he had continually to keep in check. They were in search of deer, when suddenly a huge grizzly bear emerged from a thicket about thirty yards distant, rearing himself upon his hind legs with a terrific growl, and displaying a hideous array of teeth and claws. The rifle of the young man was levelled in an instant, but John Day's iron hand was as quickly upon his arm. \" Be quiet, boy ! be quiet !\" exclaimed the hunter, between his clenched teeth, and without turning his eyes from the bear. They remained motionless. The monster regarded them for a time, then, lowering himself on his fore paws, slowly with drew. He had not gone many paces before he again turned, reared himself on his hind legs, and repeated his menace. Day's hand was still on the arm of his young companion, he again pressed it hard, and kept repeating between his teeth, \" Quiet, boy ! \u2014 keep quiet ! \u2014 keep quiet !\" \u2014 though the latter had not made a move since his first prohibition. The bear again lowered himself on all fours, retreated some twenty"], [268, "260 A HAZARDOUS SHOT. yards further, and again turned, reared, showed his teeth, and growled. This third menace was too much for the game spirit of John Day. \" By Jove !\" exclaimed he, \" I can stand this no longer,\" and in an instant a ball from his rifle whizzed into the foe. The wound was not mortal ; but, luckily, it dismayed instead of enraging the animal, and he retreated into the thicket. Day's young companion reproached him for not practising the caution which he enjoined upon others. \" Why, boy,\" replied the veteran, \" caution is caution, but one must not put up with too much even from a bear. Would you have me suffer myself to be bullied all day by a varmint?\"-"], [269, "AN INDIAN TRAIL. 261 CHAPTER XXVII.

For the two following days the travellers pursued a westerly course for thirty-ffour miles, along a ridge of country dividing the tributary waters of the Missouri and the Yellowstone. As landmarks they guided themselves by the summits of the far distant mountains, which they supposed to belong to the Big Horn chain. They were gradually rising into a higher temperature, for the weather was cold for the season, with a sharp frost in the night, and ice of an eighth of an inch in thickness. On the twenty-second of August, early in the day, they came upon the trail of a numerous band. Rose and the other hunters examined the foot-prints with great attention, and determined it to be the trail of a party of Crows, returning from an annual trading visit to the Mandans. As this trail afforded more commodious travelling, they immediately struck into it, and followed it for two days. It led them over rough hills, and through broken gullies, during which time they"], [270, "262 SUFFERINGS FROM THIRST. suffered great fatigue from the ruggedness of the country. The weather, too, which had recently been frosty, was now oppressively warm, and there was great scarcity of water, insomuch that a valuable dog belonging to Mr. M'Kenzie died of thirst. At one time they had twenty-five miles of painful travel, without a drop of water, until they arrived at a small running stream. Here they eagerly slaked their thirst ; but, this being allayed, the calls of hunger became equally importu nate. Ever since they had got among these barren and arid hills, where there was a deficiency of grass, they had met with no buffaloes ; those animals keeping in the grassy mea dows near the streams. They were obliged, therefore, to have recourse to their corn meal, which they reserved for such emergencies. Some, however, were lucky enough to kill a wolf, which they cooked for supper, and pronounced excellent food. The next morning they resumed their wayfaring, hungry and jaded, and had a dogged march of eighteen miles among the same kind of hills. At length they emerged upon a stream of clear water, one of the forks of Powder river, and to their great joy beheld once more wide grassy meadows stocked with herds of buffalo. For several days they kepi about the banks of this river, ascending it about eighteen miles. It was a hunter's paradise ; the buffaloes were in such abun dance that they were enabled to kill as many as they pleased, and to jerk a sufficient supply of meat for several days' jour neying. Here, then, they revelled and reposed after their hungry and weary travel, hunting and feasting, and reclining upon the grass. Their quiet, however, was a little marred by coming upon traces of Indians, who, they concluded, must be Crows ; they were therefore obliged to keep a more vigilant"], [271, "PEAKS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 263 watch than ever upon their horses. For several days they had been directing their march towards the lofty mountain descried by Mr. Hunt and Mr. M'Kenzie on the 17th of Au gust, the height of which rendered it a landmark over a vast extent of country. At first it had appeared to them solitary and detached ; but as they advanced towards it, it proved to be the principal summit of a chain of mountains. Day by day it varied in form, or rather its lower peaks, and the sum mits of others of the chain emerged above the clear horizon. and finally the inferior line of hills which connected most of them rose to view. So far, however, are objects discerni ble in the pure atmosphere of these elevated plains, that, from the place where they first descried the main mountain, thev had to travel a hundred and fifty miles before they reached its base. Here they encamped on the thirtieth of August, having come nearly four hundred miles since leaving the Arickara village. The mountain which now towered above them was one of the Big Horn chain, bordered by a river of the same name, and extending for a long distance rather east of north and west of south. It was a part of the great system of granite mountains which forms one of the most important and striking features of North America, stretching parallel to the coast of the Pacific from the Isthmus of Panama almost to the Arctic ocean ; and presenting a corresponding chain to that of the Andes in the southern hemisphere. This vast range has acquired from its rugged and broken character, and its sum mits of naked granite, the appellation of the Rocky mountains, a name by no means distinctive, as all elevated ranges are rocky. Among the early explorers it was known as the range of Chippewyan mountains, and this Indian name is the one it is likely to retain in poetic usage.' Rising from the midst of"], [272, "264 ELEVATED PLAINS. vast plains and prairies, traversing several degrees of latitude, dividing the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific, and seem ing to bind with diverging ridges the level regions on its flanks, it has been figuratively termed the backbone of the northern continent. The Rocky mountains do not present a range of uniform elevation, but rather groups and occasionally detached peaks. Though some of these rise to the region of perpetual snows, and are upwards of eleven thousand feet in real altitude, yet their height from their immediate bases is not so great as might be imagined, as they swell up from elevated plains, several thousand feet above the level of the ocean. These plains are often of a desolate sterility ; mere sandy wastes, formed of the detritus of the granite heights, destitute of trees and herb age, scorched by the ardent and reflected rays of the summer's sun, and, in winter, swept by chilling blasts from the snow clad mountains. Such is a great part of that vast region extending north and south along the mountains, several hundred miles in width, which has not improperly been termed the Great American Desert. It is a region that almost discourages all hope of cultivation, and can only be traversed with safety by keeping near the streams which intersect it. Extensive plains likewise occur among the higher regions of the mountains, of considerable fertility. Indeed, these lofty plats of table land seem to form a peculiar feature in the American continents. Some occur among the Cordilleras of the Andes, where cities, and towns, and cultivated farms, are to be seen eight thousand feet above the level of the sea. The Rocky mountains, as we have already observed, occur sometimes singly or in groups, and occasionally in collateral ridges. Between these are deep valleys, with small streams winding through them, which find their way into the lower"], [273, "THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS. 265 plains, augmenting as they proceed, and ultimately discharging themselves into those vast rivers, which traverse the prairies like great arteries, and drain the continent. While the granitic summits of the Rocky mountains are bleak and bare, many of the inferior ridges are scantily clothed with scrubbed pines, oaks, cedar and furze. Various parts of the mountains also bear traces of volcanic action. Some of the interior valleys are strewed with scoria and broken stones, evidently of volcanic origin ; the surrounding rocks bear the like character, and vestiges of extinguished craters are to be seen on the elevated heights. We have already noticed the superstitious feelings with wliich the Indians regard the Black hills ; but this immense range of mountains, which divides all that they know of the world, and gives birth to such mighty rivers, is still more ar object of awe and veneration. They call it \" The crest of the world,\" and think that Wacondah, or the master of life, as they designate the Supreme Being, has his residence among these aerial heights. The tribes on the eastern prairies call them the mountains of the setting sun. Some of them place the \" happy hunting grounds,\" their ideal paradise, among the recesses of these mountains ; but say that they are invisible to living men. Here also is the \" Land of Souls,\" in which are the \" towns of the free and generous spirits,\" where those who have pleased the master of life while living, enjoy after death all manner of delights. Wonders are told of these mountains by the distant tribes, whose warriors or hunters have ever wandered in their neigh borhood. It is thought by some that, after death, they will have to travel to these mountains and ascend one of theii highest and most rugged peaks, among rocks and snows and tumbling torrents. After many moons of painful toil they will 23"], [274, "266 TOWNS OF THE GENEROUS SPIRITS. reach the summit, from whence they will have a view over the land of souls. There they will see the happy hunting grounds, with the souls of the brave and good living in tents in green meadows, by bright running streams, or hunting the herds of buffalo, and elks, and deer, which have been slain on earth. There, too, they will see the villages or towns of the free and generous spirits brightening in the midst of delicious prairies. If they have acquitted themselves well while living, they will be permitted to descend and enjoy this happy country ; if otherwise, they will but be tantabzed with this prospect of it, and then hurled back from the mountain, to wander about the sandy plains, and endure the eternal pangs of unsatisfied thirst and hunger."], [275, "HAUNTS OF THE CROW INDIANS. 267 CHAPTER XXVIII.

The travellers had now arrived in the vicinity of the mountain regions infested by the Crow Indians. These restless ma rauders, as has already been observed, are apt to be continually on the prowl about the skirts of the mountains ; and even when encamped in some deep and secluded glen, they keep scouts upon the cliffs and promontories, who, unseen them selves, can discern every living thing that moves over the sub jacent plains and valleys. It was not to be expected that our travellers could pass unseen through a region thus vigilantly centinelled ; accordingly, in the edge of the evening, not long after they had encamped at the foot of the Big Horn Sierra, a couple of wild-looking beings, scantily clad in skins, but well armed, and mounted on horses as wild-looking as them selves, were seen approaching with great caution from among the rocks. They might have been mistaken for two of the evil spirits of the mountains so formidable in Indian fable. Rose was immediately sent out to hold a parley with them, and invite them to the camp. They proved so be two scouts"], [276, "268 MOUNTAIN SCAMPERERS A CROW CAMP. from the same band that had been tracked for some days past, and which was now encamped at some distance in the folds of the mountain. They were easily prevailed upon to come to the camp, where they were well received, and, after remain ing there until late in the evening, departed to make a report of all they had seen and experienced, to their companions. The following day had scarce dawned, when a troop of these wild mountain scamperers came galloping with whoops and yells into the camp, bringing an invitation from their chief for the white men to visit him. The tents were accordingly struck, the horses laden, and the party were soon on the march. The Crow horsemen, as they escorted them, appeared 1.0 take a pride in shewing off their equestrian skill and hardi hood ; careering at full speed on their half-savage steeds, and dashing among rocks and crags, and up and down the most rugged and dangerous places with perfect ease and unconcern. A ride of sixteen miles brought them, in the afternoon, in sight of the Crow camp. It was composed of leathern tents pitched in a meadow on the border of a small clear stream at the foot of the mountain. A great number of horses were grazing in the vicinity, many of them doubtless captured in marauding excursions. The Crow chieftain came forth to meet his guests with great professions of friendship, and conducted them to his tents, pointing out, by the way, a convenient place where they might fix their camp. No sooner had they done so, than Mr. Hunt opened some of the packages and made the chief a present of a scarlet blanket, and a quantity of powder and ball ; he gave him also some knives, trinkets and tobacco to be distributed among his warriors, with all which the grim potentate seemed for the time, well pleased. As the Crows, however, were reputed to be perfidious in the extreme, and"], [277, "DEALINGS WITH THE CROWS. 269 as errant freebooters as the bird after which they were so worthily named ; and as their general feelings towards the whites were known to be by no means friendly, the inter course with them was conducted with great circumspection. The following day was passed in trading with the Crows for buffalo robes and skins, and in bartering galled and jaded horses for others that were in good condition. Some of the men also, purchased horses on their own account, so that the number now amounted to one hundred and twenty-one, most of them sound and active, and fit for mountain service. Their wants being supplied they ceased all further traffic, much to the dissatisfaction of the Crows, who became ex tremely urgent to continue the trade, and, finding their impor tunities of no avail, assumed an insolent and menacing tone. All this was attributed by Mr. Hunt and his associates, to the perfidious instigations of Rose the interpreter, who they sus pected of the desire to foment ill-will between them and the savages, for the promotion of his nefarious plans. M'Lellan, with his usual tranchant mode of dealing out justice, resolved to shoot the desperado on the spot in case of any outbreak. Nothing of the kind, however, occurred. The Crows were probably daunted by the resolute, though quiet, demeanor of the white men, and the constant vigilance and armed prepara tion which they maintained ; and Rose, if he really still har bored his knavish designs, must have perceived that they were suspected, and, if attempted to be carried into effect, might bring ruin on his own head. The next morning, bright and early, Mr. Hunt proposed to resume his journeying. He took a ceremonious leave of the Crow chieftain, and his vagabond warriors, and, according to previous arrangements, consigned to their cherishing friendship and fraternal adoption, their worthy confederate, Rose ; who, 23*"], [278, "270 AN ADOPTED CROW. having figured among the water pirates of the Mississippi, was well fitted to rise to distinction among the land pirates of the Rocky mountains. It is proper to add that the ruffian was well received among the tribe and appeared to be perfectly satisfied with the com promise he had made ; feeling much more at his ease among savages than among white men. It is outcasts from civiliza tion, fugitives from justice, and heartless desperadoes of this kind, who sow the seeds of enmity and bitterness among the unfortunate tribes of the frontier. There is no enemy so implacable against a country or a community as one of its own people who has rendered himself an alien by his crimes. Right glad to be relieved from this treacherous companion. Mr. Hunt pursued his course along the skirts of the mountain in a southern direction, seeking for some practicable defile by which he might pass through it ; none such presented, however, in the course of fifteen miles, and he encamped on a small stream, still on the outskirts. The green meadows which border these mountain streams are generally well stocked with game, and the hunters soon killed several fat elks, which supplied the camp with fresh meat. In the eve ning the travellers were surprised by an unwelcome visit from several Crows belonging to a different band from that which they had recently left, and who said their camp was among the mountains. The consciousness of being environed by such dangerous neighbors, and of being still within the range of Rose and his fellow ruffians, obliged the party to be con tinually on the alert and to maintain weary vigils throughout the night, lest they should be robbed of their horses. On the third of September, finding that the mountain still stretched onwards, presenting a continued barrier, they en deavored to force a passage to the westward, but soon became"], [279, "AN UNEXPECTED VISIT. 271 entangled among rocks and precipices which set all their efforts at defiance. The mountain seemed for the most part rugged, bare, and sterile ; yet here and there it was clothed with pines, and with shrubs and flowering plants, some of which were in bloom. In toiling among these weary places, their thirst became excessive, for no water was to be met with. Numbers of the men wandered off into rocky dells and ravines in hopes of finding some brook or fountain ; some of whom lost their way and did not rejoin the main party. After half a day of painful and fruitless scrambling, Mr. Hunt gave up the attempt to penetrate in this direction, and, returning to the little stream on the skirts of the mountain, pitched his tents within six miles of his encampment of the preceding night. He now ordered that signals should be made for the stragglers in quest of water, but the night passed away without their return. The next morning, to their surprise, Rose made his appear ance at the camp, accompanied by some of his Crow associ ates. His unwelcome visit revived their suspicions, but he announced himself as a messenger of good-will from the chief, who, finding they had taken a wrong road, had sent Rose and his companions to guide them to a nearer and better one across the mountain. Having no choice, being themselves utterly at fault, they set out under this questionable escort. They had not gone far before they fell in with the whole party of Crows, who, they now found, were going the same road with themselves. The two cavalcades of white and red men, therefore, pushed on together, and presented a wild and picturesque spectacle, as, equipped with various weapons and in various garbs, with trains of pack horses, they wound in long lines through the"], [280, "272 AN INFANT JOCKEY. rugged defiles, and up and down the crags and steeps of the mountain. The travellers had again an opportunity to see and admire the equestrian habitudes and address of this hard-riding tribe. They were all mounted, man, woman and child, for the Crows have horses in abundance, so that no one goes on foot. The children are perfect imps on horseback. Among them was one so young that he could not yet speak. He was tied on a colt of two years old, but managed the reins as if by instinct, and plied the whip with true Indian prodigality. Mr. Hunt inquired the age of this infant jockey and was answered that \" he had seen two winters.\" This is almost realizing the fable of the centaurs ; nor can we wonder at the equestrian adroitness of these savages, who are thus in a manner cradled in the saddle, and become in infancy almost identified with the animal they bestride. The mountain defiles were exceedingly rough and broken. and the travelling painful to the burthened horses. The party, therefore, proceeded but slowly, and were gradually left be hind by the band of Crows, who had taken the lead. It is more than probable that Mr. Hunt loitered in his course, to get rid of such doubtful fellow-travellers. Certain it is that he felt a sensation of relief as he saw the whole crew, the renegade Rose, and all, disappear among the windings of the mountain, and heard the last yelp of the savages die away in the distance. When they were fairly ought of sight, and out of hearing, he encamped on the head waters of the little stream of the preceding day, having come about sixteen miles. Here he remained all the succeeding day, as well to give time for the Crows to get in the advance, as for the stragglers, who had"], [281, "SEARCH AFTER STRAGGLERS. 273 wandered away in quest of water two days previously, to rejoin the camp. Indeed, considerable uneasiness began to be felt concerning these men lest they should become utterly bewildered in the defiles of the mountains, or should fall into the hands of some marauding band of savages. Some of the most experienced hunters were sent in search of them, others, in the meantime, employed themselves in hunting. The narrow valley in which they encamped being watered by a running stream, yielded fresh pasturage, and, though in tbe heart of the Big Horn mountains, was well stocked with buf falo. Several of these were killed, as also a grizzly bear.

Resuming their course on the following morning, Mr. Hunt and his companions continued on westward through a rugged region of hills and rocks, but diversified in many places by grassy little glens, with springs of water, bright sparkling brooks, clumps of pine trees, and a profusion of flowering plants, which were in full bloom, although the weather was frosty. These beautiful and verdant recesses, running through and softening the rugged mountains, were cheering and re freshing to the way worn travellers. In the course of the morning, as they were entangled in a defile, they beheld a small band of savages, as wild looking as the surrounding scenery, who reconnoitred them warily from the rocks before they ventured to advance. Some of them were mounted on horses rudely caparisoned, with bridles or halters of buffalo hide, one end trailing after them on the ground. They proved to be a mixed party of Flatheads and Shoshonies, or Snakes ; and as these tribes will be frequently mentioned in the course of this work, we shall give a few introductory particulars concerning them."], [283, "275 SNAKES AND FLATHEADS. The Flatheads in question are not to be confounded with those of the name who dwell about the lower waters of the Columbia ; neither do they flatten their heads, as the others do. They inhabit the banks of a river on the west side of the mountains, and are described as simple, honest, and hospitable. Like all people of similar character, whether civilized or sa vage, they are prone to be imposed upon ; and are especially maltreated by the ruthless Blackfeet, who harass them iu their villages, steal their horses by night, or openly carry them off in the face of day, without provoking pursuit or retaliation. The Shoshonies are a branch of the once powerful and pros perous tribe of the Snakes, who possessed a glorious hunting country about the upper forks of the Missouri, abounding in beaver and buffalo. Their hunting ground was occasionally invaded by the Blackfeet, but the Snakes battled bravely for their domains, and a long and bloody feud existed, with variable success. At length the Hudson's Bay Company, extending their trade into the interior, had dealings with the Blackfeet, who were nearest to them, and supplied them with fire-arms. The Snakes, who occasionally traded with the Spaniards, en deavored, but in vain, to obtain similar weapons ; the Spanish traders wisely refused to arm them so formidably. The Black feet had now a vast advantage, and soon dispossessed the poor Snakes of their favorite hunting grounds, their land of plenty, and drove them from place to place, until they were fain to take refuge in the wildest and most desolate recesses of the Rocky mountains. Even here they are subjected to occasional visits from their implacable foes, as long as they have horses, or any other property to tempt the plunderer. Thus by degrees the Snakes have become a scattered, broken spirited, impoverished people ; keeping about lonely rivers and mountain streams, and subsisting chiefly upon fish. Suchof"], [284, "276 DIGGERS AND SHOSHONIES. them as still possess horses, and occasionally figure as hunters. are called Shoshonies ; but there is another class, the most abject and forlorn, who are called Shuckers, or more commonly Diggers and Root eaters. These are a shy, secret, solitary race, who keep in the most retired parts of the mountains. lurking like gnomes in caverns and clefts of the rocks, and subsisting in a great measure on the roots of the earth. Some times, in passing through a solitary mountain valley, the tra veller comes perchance upon the bleeding carcass of a deer or buffalo that has just been slain. He looks round in vain for the hunter ; the whole landscape is lifeless and deserted : at length he perceives a thread of smoke, curling up from among the crags and cliffs, and scrambling to the place, finds some forlorn and skulking brood of diggers, terrified at being dis covered. The Shoshonies, however, who, as has been observed, have still \" horse to ride and weapon to wear,\" are somewhat bolder in their spirit, and more open and wide in their wanderings. In the autumn, when salmon disappear from the rivers, and hunger begins to pinch, they even venture down into their ancient hunting grounds, to make a foray among the buffaloes. In this perilous enterprise they are occasionally joined by the Flatheads, the persecutions of the Blackfeet having produced a close alliance and co-operation between these luckless and maltreated tribes. Still, notwithstanding their united force, every step they take within the debateable ground, is taken in fear and trembling, and with the utmost precaution : and an Indian trader assures us, that he has seen at least five hundred of them, armed and equipped for action, and keeping watch upon the hill tops, while about fifty were hunting in the prairie. Their excursions are brief and hurried ; as soon as they have collected and jerked sufficient buffalo meat for winter provi-"], [285, "277 ENCAMPMENT ON THE MOUNTAINS. sions, they pack their horses, abandon the dangerous hunting grounds, and hasten back to the mountains, happy if they have not the terrible Blackfeet rattling after them. Such a confederate band of Shoshonies and Flatheads, was the one met by our travellers. It was bound on a visit to the Arapahoes, a tribe inhabiting the banks of the Nebraska. They were armed to the best of their scanty means, and some of the Shoshonies had bucklers of buffalo hide, adorned with feathers and leathern fringes, and which have a charmed virtui in their eyes, from having been prepared, with mystic cere monies by their conjurors. In company with this wandering band our travellers pro ceeded all day. In the evening they encamped near to eacl other in a defile of the mountains, on the borders of a streair running north, and falling into Bighorn river. In the vicinity of the camp, they found gooseberries, strawberries and cur rants, in great abundance. The defile bore traces of having been a thoroughfare for countless herds of buffaloes, though not one was to be seen. The hunters succeeded in killing an elk and several black-tailed deer. They were now in the bosom of the second Bighorn ridge, with another lofty and snow-crowned mountain, full in view to the west. Fifteen miles of western course, brought them, on the following day, down into an intervening plain, well stocked with buffalo. Here the Snakes and Flatheads joined with the white hunters in a successful hunt, that soon filled the camp with provisions. On the morning of the 9th of September, the travellers parted company with their Indian friends, and continued on their course to the west. A march of thirty miles brough' them, in the evening, to the banks of a rapid and beautifully- clear stream about a hundred yards wide. It is the north fork 24"], [286, "278 WIND RIVER. or branch of the Bighorn river, but bears its peculiar name of the Wind river, from being subject in the winter season to a continued blast which sweeps its banks and prevents the snow from lying on them. This blast is said to be caused by a narrow gap or funnel in the mountains through which the river forces its way between perpendicular precipices, resembling cut rocks. This river gives its name to a whole range of mountains consisting of three parallel chains, eighty miles in length, and about twenty or twenty-five broad. One of its peaks is proba bly fifteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, being one of the highest of the the Rocky Sierra. These mountains give rise, not merely to the Wind or Bighorn river, but to several branches of the Yellowstone and the Missouri on the east, and of the Columbia and Colorado on the west ; thus dividing the sources of these mighty streams. For five succeeding days, Mr. Hunt and his party continued up the course of the Wind river, to the distance of about eighty' miles, crossing and recrossing it, according to its wind ings, and the nature of its banks ; sometimes passing through valleys, at other times scrambling over rocks and hills. The country in general was destitute of trees, but they passed through groves of wormwood, eight and ten feet in height, which they used occasionally for fuel, and they met with large quantities of wild flax. The mountains were destitute of game ; they came in sight of two grizzly bears, but could not get near enough for a shot ; provisions, therefore, began to be scanty. They saw large flights of the kind of thrush commonly called the robin, and many smaller birds of migratory species ; but the hills in general appeared lonely and with few signs of animal life. On the evening of the 14th September, they encamped on the"], [287, "LANDMARKS OF THE COLUMBIA. 279 forks of the Wind, or Bighorn river. The largest of these forks came from the range of Wind river mountains. The hunters who served as guides to the party in this part of their route, had assured Mr. Hunt that, by following up Wind river, and crossing a single mountain ridge, he would come upon the head waters of the Columbia. The scarcity of game, however, which already had been felt to a pinching degree, and which threatened them with famine among the sterile heights which lay before them, admonished them to change their course. It was determined, therefore, to make for a stream, which, they were informed, passed through the neighboring mountains, to the south of west, on the grassy banks of which it was probable they would meet with buffalo. Accordingly, about three o'clock on the following day, meet ing with a beaten Indian road which lead in the proper direction, they struck into it turning their backs upon Wind river. In the course of the day, they came to a height that com jnanded an almost boundless prospect. Here one of the guides paused, and, after considering the vast landscape atten tively, pointed to three mountain peaks glistening with snow, which rose, he said, above a fork of Columbia river. They were hailed by the travellers with that joy with which a beacon on a seashore is hailed by mariners after a long and dangerous voyage. It is true there was many a weary league to be traversed before they should reach these landmarks, for, allowing for their evident height, and the extreme transpa rency of the atmosphere, they could not be much less than a hundred miles distant. Even after reaching them, there would yet remain hundreds of miles of their journey to be accom plished. All these matters were forgotten in the joy at seeing the first landmarks of the Columbia, that river which formed"], [288, "280 SPANISH RIVER. the bourne of the expedition. These remarkable peaks are known to some travellers as the Tetons ; as they had been guiding points for many days, to Mr. Hunt, he gave them the name of the Pilot Knobs. The travellers continued their course to the south of west for about forty miles, through a region so elevated that patches of snow lay on the highest summits, and on the northern declivities. At length they came to the desired stream, the object of their search, the waters of which flowed to the west. It was, in fact, a branch of the Colorado, which falls into the gulf of Calafornia, and had received from the hunters the name of Spanish river, from information given by the Indians, that Spaniards resided upon its lower waters. The aspect of this river and its vicinity was cheering to the vay worn and hungry travellers. Its banks were green, and 'here were grassy valleys running from it in various directions, into the heart of the rugged mountains, with herds of buffalo quietly grazing. The hunters sallied forth with keen alacrity, and soon returned laden with provisions. In this part of the mountains Mr. Hunt met with three different kinds of gooseberries. The common purple, on a low and very thorny bush ; a yellow kind, of an excellent flavor, growing on a stalk free from thorns ; and a deep purple, of the size and taste of our winter grape, with a thorny stalk. There were also three kinds of currants, one very large and well tasted, of a purple color, and growing on a bush eight or nine feet high. Another of a yellow color, and of the size and taste of the large red currant, the bush four or five feet high ; and the third a beautiful scarlet, resembling the strawberry in sweetness, though rather insipid, and growing on a low bush. \u25a0 On the 17th, they continued down the course of the river, making fifteen miles to the southwest. The river abounded"], [289, "281 A HALT FOR REPOSE. with geese and ducks, and there were signs of its being in habited by beaver and otters : indeed they were now approach ing regions where these animals, the great objects of the fur trade, are said to abound. They encamped for the night opposite the end of a mountain in the west, which was probably the last chain of the Rocky mountains. On the following morning they abandoned the main course of Span ish river, and taking a northwest direction for eight miles, came upon one of its little tributaries, issuing out of the bosom of the mountains, and running through green meadows, yield ing pasturage to herds of buffalo. As these were probably the last of that animal they would meet with, they encamped on the grassy banks of the river, determining to spend several days in hunting, so as to be able to jerk sufficient meat to supply them until they should reach the waters of the Co lumbia, where they trusted to find fish enough for their sup port. A little repose, too, was necessary for both men and horses, after their rugged and incessant marching ; having in the course of the last seventeen days, traversed two hundred and sixty miles of rough, and in many parts, sterile, mountain country. 24*"], [290, "282 A HUNTING ENCAMPMENT.

Five days were passed by Mr. Hunt and his companions in the fresh meadows watered by the bright little mountain stream. The hunters made great havoc among the buffaloes, and brought in quantities of meat ; the voyageurs busied themselves about the fires, roasting and stewing for present purposes, or drying provisions for the journey ; the pack horses, eased of their burthens, rolled in the grass, or grazed at large about the ample pastures ; those of the party who had no call upon their services, indulged in the luxury of perfect relaxation, and the camp presented a picture of rude feasting and revelry, of mingled bustle and repose, characteristic of a halt in a fine hunting country. In the course of one of their excursions, some of the men came in sight of a small party of Indians, who instantly fled in great apparent consternation. They immediately returned to camp with the intelligence : upon which Mr. Hunt and four others flung themselves upon their horses, and sallied forth to reconnoitre. After riding for about eight miles, they came upon a wild mountain scene. A lonely green valley stretched before them, surrounded by rugged heights. A herd of buffalo were careering madly"], [291, "283 SHOSHONIE HUNTERS. through it, with a troop of savage horsemen in full chase, plying them with their bows and arrows. The appearance of Mr. Hunt and his companions put an abrupt end to the hunt ; the buffalo scuttled off in one direction, while the Indians plied their lashes and galloped off in another, as fast as their steeds could carry them. Mr. Hunt gave chase ; there was a sharp scamper, though of short continuance. Two young Indians, who were indifferently mounted, were soon overtaken. They w*ere terribly frightened, and evidently gave themselves up for lost. By degrees their fears were allayed by kind treatment ; but they continued to regard the strangers with a mixture of awe and wonder ; for it was the first time in their lives they had ever seen a white man. They belonged to a party of Snakes who had come across the mountains on their autumnal hunting excursion to provide buffalo meat for the winter. Being persuaded of the peaceable intentions of Mr. Hunt and his companions, they willingly conducted them to their camp. It was pitched in a narrow valley on the margin of a stream. The tents were of dressed skins ; some of them fantastically painted ; with horses grazing about them. The approach of the party caused a transient alarm in the camp, for these poor Indians were ever on the look out for cruel foes. No sooner, however, did they recog nise the garb and complexion of their visiters, than their appre hensions were changed into joy ; for some of them had dealt with white men, and knew them to be friendly, and to abound with articles of singular value. They welcomed them, there fore, to their tents, set food before them ; and entertained them to the best of their power. They had been successful in their hunt, and their camp was full of jerked buffalo meat ; all of the choicest kind, and extremely fat. Mr. Hunt purchased enough of them, in addi-"], [292, "284 HOBACK's RIVER. tion to what had been killed and cured by his own hunters, to load all the horses excepting those reserved for the partners and the wife of Pierre Dorion. He found also a few beaver skins in their camp, for which he paid liberally, as an induce ment for them to hunt for more ; informing them that some of his party intended to live among the mountains, and trade with the native hunters for their peltries. The poor Snakes soon comprehended the advantages thus held out to them, and pro mised to exert themselves to procure a quantity of beaver skins for future traffic. Being now well supplied with provisions, Mr. Hunt broke up his encampment on the 24th of September, and continued on to the west. A march of fifteen miles, over a mountain ridge, brought them to a stream about fifty feet in width, which Hoback, one of their guides, who had trapped about the neigh borhood when in the service of Mr. Henry, recognised for one of the head waters of the Columbia. The travellers hailed it with delight, as the first stream they had encountered tending toward their point of destination. They kept along it for two days, during which, from the contribution of many rills and brooks, it gradually swelled into a small river. As it mean dered among rocks and precipices, they were frequently obliged to ford it, and such was its rapidity, that the men were often in danger of being swept away. Sometimes the banks advanced so close upon the river, that they were obliged to scramble up and down their rugged promontories, or to skirt along their bases where there was scarce a foothold. Their horses had dangerous falls in some of these passes. One of them rolled, with his load, nearly two hundred feet down hill into the river, but without receiving any injury. At length they emerged from these stupendous defiles, and continued for several miles along the bank of Hoback's river, through one"], [293, "MAD RIVER. 285 of the stern mountain valleys. Here it was joined by a river of greater magnitude and swifter current, and their united waters swept off through the valley in one impetuous stream, which, from its rapidity and turbulence, had received the name of Mad river. At tbe confluence of these streams the travellers encamped. An important point in their arduous journey had been attained, a few miles from their camp rose the three vast snowy peaks called the Tetons, or the Pilot Knobs, the great landmarks of the Columbia, by which they had shaped their course through this mountain wilderness. By their feet flowed the rapid current of Mad river, a stream ample enough to admit of the navigation of canoes, and down which they might possibly be able to steer their course to the main body of the Columbia. The Canadian voyageurs rejoiced at the idea of once more launching themselves upon their favorite element ; of exchanging their horses for canoes, and of gliding down the bosoms of rivers, instead of scram bling over the backs of mountains. Others of the party, also, inexperienced in this kind of travelling, considered their toils and troubles as drawing to a close. They had conquered the chief difficulties of this great rocky barrier, and now flattered themselves with the hope of an easy downward course for the rest of their journey. Little did they dream of the hardships and perils by land and water, which were yet to be encoun tered in the frightful wilderness that intervened between them and the shores of the Pacific !
