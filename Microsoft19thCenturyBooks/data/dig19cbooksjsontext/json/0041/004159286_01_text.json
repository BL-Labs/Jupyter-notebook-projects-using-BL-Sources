The series of books preserved in the Town Clerk's Record Room, now known as the \" Remembrancia,\" consists of nine volumes, embracing the period from 1579 (21st Elizabeth) to 1664 (16th Charles II.). These archives contain copies of the correspondence between the Sovereigns, their Ministers, the Privy Council, the Lord Mayors, Courts of Aldermen and Common Council, and many persons of distinction, upon matters relating to the government of the City, its rights, privileges, usages and customs, religion, trade and commerce, public buildings, markets, churches, &c. The eventful epoch in the history of England over which the volumes extend, and the varied nature of the subjects treated of in the letters, naturally suggest the inference that many matters of national interest would be therein referred to. The wars of Elizabeth, and the important aid rendered by the citizens in ships, men, and money, towards their suc- cessful conclusion ; the numerous and frequently excessive claims made by that monarch upon their loyalty, \u2014 which (as is forcibly stated in some of their remonstrances) did not always produce adequate advantages to her subjects, whilst they impoverished and injured the trade and credit of the country ; the monopolies granted to her favourites, and the numerous applications for the appointment of Court candidates to Municipal offices, are the subjects of much of the earlier ccvaresoondence. A"], [16, "IV TREFACE. The era of the Stuarts, especially the position occupied by the City in the troublous times of Charles I. and the Restora tion of Charles 1 1., afforded fruitful themes for frequent com munications between the Crown, the Government, and the Civic Authorities. The superior military organization of the City forces such as the Trained Bands, the Artillery Company, and other kindred bodies \u2014 at a time when the standing army was in its infancy, and viewed with disfavour by the people ; the riches of the merchants, \u2014 which ever offered to the Crown the greatest facilities for borrowing money, \u2014 and their extensive trade with foreign countries, necessitating as it did the employ ment of a vast number of vessels and men, and thus affording in times of emergency a means of rapidly and effectually increasing the navy, \u2014 could not fail to enhance the power of the citizens in the councils of their Sovereign. These combined considerations are found exerting their influence throughout the collection, and necessarily attach considerable importance, in an historic point of view, to the contents of the volumes. The domestic and internal regulations of the City at a period when its manners, habits, and customs were undergoing rapid variations, arising from the then recent changes in the religion of the people, and the growing pretensions of the trading community, also contribute to their value. The preservation of the peace ; the visitation of the Plague, and the action of the Civic Authorities for its sup pression ; the opposition evinced by the magistrates to public plays, which they regarded with especial aversion as being the means of spreading infection, as incentives to riots and dis orders by apprentices and others, and as tending to the increase of vice and crime ; the regulation of buildings with a view to the prevention of overcrowding in dwellings ; the accumulation of corn and other grain in the City's stores for the use of the citizens in times of scarcity; the supply of water; the en^cX"], [17, "PREFACE. V ments withjrespect to the prices of provisions and the com pulsory abstinence from flesh in Lent and on fast and fish days ; and the restrictions imposed upon vintners, victuallers, tavern keepers, butchers, cooks, poulterers, and others, \u2014 all in their degree augment the interest of the collection. The earliest of these volumes appears to have been originally known under the title of \" Letters from the Lords of \"the Councill, from A? 1579 to 1592.\" The first entry in the records of the Corporation referring to such a compilation is dated 6th February, 1570; 13th Elizabeth (Repertory 17, p. ioib-io2), when the office of Remembrancer was created, and Mr. Thomas Norton1 was appointed the first holder thereof, and is as follows :\u2014 \" Item. \u2014 This daye Thomas Norton, Gent., is admytted to be Remem \" brauncer of this Cittye, accordinge to th' articles followinge, and was sworne \" officer accordinge to the othe followinge. \" He shall keape all the Bookes of the Cittye, suche as to his custodie shall be \" delivered by indenture betwene Mr- Chamblcn, Mr- Towne Clerk, and him. \"All suche matters concerninge the Cittye as usually have bene entred by ; he shall cause to be entred and engrossed with convenyent spede.

Vide biographical notice of him, page 27, note I. A 2"], [18, "VI PREFACE. The next entry on the subject occurs on the 5th Novem ber, 1573; z5tri Elizabeth (Repertory 18, fol. 101): \u2014 \" Item.\u2014 This daie it is ordered that all the Lra wch hereafter be sent unto \" my Lord Maior and this Course from the Ouenes Matie and Her Counsell shalbe \"entred into a sev'all booke therefore provided verbatim.\" By another order, dated ioth December, 1579; 22nd Elizabeth (Repertory 20, fol. 23s), it will be seen that the Town Clerk was directed \u2014 \" To cause the answeares from henceforthe to be made of such Lies as shalbe \" directed to this Court from any personage of hofior or creditt, to be entred in a \" booke to be provided for that purpose.\" But in the following year the Remembrancer is again directed to discharge the duty, 12th April, 1580; 22nd Elizabeth (Repertory 20, fol. 60): \u2014 \" Item. \u2014 Yt was dccreyd by this Cote that Mr. Norton shall from hence \" forthe engrosse the aunsweares of all Irel sent from this Corte for the affayres of \" this Cyttye, to any psolT of honor or otherwyse ; and orderyd by the same Corte \" that Mr. Chambleyn of the sayd Cyttye shall yearely paye from henceforthe \" unto the sayd Mr. Norton for so longe tyme as he shall ingrosse the said lies \" the some of tenne powndes by the yeare at the sower usuall feastes accustomed \" over and besydes suche stypend and salorye as hearetofore hath bynne geven \" and graunted unto hym by the same Corte.\" Upon the appointment of Dr. Gyles Fletcher as successor to Mr. Norton, on the 5th January, 1586; 29th Elizabeth (Repertory 21, pp. 384-5), there is an entry to the effect that he was to have the place lately enjoyed by Mr. Thomas Norton, Gent., deceased, at a salary of ,\u00a350 per ann., but to be called Secretary to the Lord Mayor. His duties are set out : amongst others, he is required \u2014 \" To attend and be reddye aswell in this Courte as at the Mansyon Howse \" of the L. Maior for the tyme beinge when the L. Maior shall send for hym for \" the wrytynge and ingrossynge of all suche Ki as from tyme to tyme shalbe \"sent from thys Courte or from the L.

The first payment thereof to begynne \" at Mich\"\"8 next, over and above the yearely some of .\u00a350, heretofore graunted \" unto him by this Court.\" The origin of the Collection seems attributable, there fore, to one or other of these resolutions. The following entry shows that there was a collection made by Mr. Thomas Norton, some time M.P. for and Remembrancer to the City of London, which appears to have found its way into the custody of the Chamberlain. Sth July, 1 61 9; 17th James I. (Repertory 34, p. 175s) : \u2014 \" Item. \u2014 This daye Mr. Dios (Remembrancer) presented to this Court a \" booke of lrTs entred fairelye by Mr. Norton in the tyme he was Remembrancer \" to this Cittye, wth the receipt of wch Booke Mr. Chamberlen chargeth himself. \" And it is ordered by this Court that Mr. Chamberlen shall paye unto the said \" Mr. Dios the some of \u00a37 14s. od. wch he formerly disbursed to obteyne the \" booke into his handes, beinge sould to a Broker.\" Nearly the whole of the first volume (which ranges from 1579 to 1592) is apparently in one handwriting, the earlier letters not being entered in chronological order. This may, therefore, be the collection of Mr. Norton referred to, more especially as a break occurs about the time of his death, which is said to have taken place in March, 1583-4. The last entry prior to that date is of the 13th February, 1583. There is then a blank leaf, and upon the following page is inscribed a Letter of the 19th January, 1586, to the Queen (Elizabeth), announcing the appointment, in accordance with her desire, of Dr. Gyles Fletcher as his successor, who apparently con tinued the work."], [20, "VIII PREFACE. Volume ii., which extends from 1593 to 1609, was originally in several parts, some of the parts consisting almost entirely of Letters to, and others of answers from, the City. These two Volumes were bound in their present form under the directions of Mr. Serjeant Merewether, Town Clerk, from 1842 to 1859. The first up to his time bore the title already mentioned, \" Letters from the Lords of the Council, \" etc.\" From the similarity of their contents to those of the subsequent Volumes, he gave them the title \" Remembrancia,\" by which the others were and are still known. Volume iii., from 16 10 to 1614, begins the regular series of the \"^Remembrancia.\" This and the subsequent Volumes,. to Volume vii. inclusive, originally consisted of a number of small books in vellum covers, each containing the entries of the Letters of a Mayoralty or part of one, and bearing on the cover the name of the Mayor, and that of the Remem brancer who compiled it. The Letters of Sir Thomas Hayes's Mayoralty (16 14- 15) are missing in Volume iii., but a list of them is preserved therein. Volume iv. extends from 16 15 to 1618. Volume v. from 1618 to 1622. Volume vi. from 1622 to 1629. . Volume vii. from 1629 to 1637, but the Letters for the Mayoralty of Sir George Whitmore (163 1-1632) are wanting. Volume viii., like Volumes i. and ii., is a miscellaneous collection, the Letters being irregularly entered, and several breaks occurring. It ranges from 16 13 to 1640. Volume ix. extends from 1660 to 1664. This bears the title \" Letters from the King, Council and others to the City,\" but being of a similar character to the other Volumes is in serted in the series. To Volume i. a Calendar, with an Index, was compiled by Mr. T. Brewer, Secretary of the City of London School, formerly in the Town Clerk's Office, which he presented to the Library. The indexes to Volumes ii. and viii. of the series were published by the Corporation upon the recommendation of"], [21, "PREFACE. IX the Library Committee, under the circumstances stated in their Report on the Records presented to the Common Council on the 1 6th December, 1869, from which the following is an extract : \u2014 \"The series consists of nine volumes, which date from 1580 to 1664; of \" these six were found to possess indexes which are little better than mere tables \" of contents, and afford no satisfactory clue to the student who may have to refer \"to them for municipal or historical purposes ;\u2014 one, a Calendar, and two \" (Volumes ii. and viii.) were entirely unindexed. \" The first stage of our proceedings, therefore, was to direct that a full \" Analytical Index of Volumes ii. and viii. should be prepared, which was \" accordingly done, and the interesting and valuable nature of their contents, as \"now first brought to light, induces us to recommend that indexes, upon a \" similarly exhaustive plan, should be compiled of the remaining volumes of the \" series, and that it be referred to us to prepare and print the same, with authority \" to send copies to every member of this Court, the learned Societies, Public \" Libraries, &c. &c.\" This Report was agreed to by the Common Council on the ioth March, 1870, and in accordance with the authority thus given to them the Library Committee have directed the publication of the present Indexes to the entire series. The Roman numerals preceding each Letter refer to the Volume, and the figures to the number of the Letter in the Volume. In the short and by no means exhaustive biographical notes (in the compilation of which valuable aid was rendered by Reginald Hanson, Esq., M.A., F.S.A., Chairman of the Library Committee, 1876) to some of the persons mentioned in the Letters will be found, in numerous instances, evidence, hitherto but little known, of the connexion with the Corporation of the ancestors of many of the noble families of our own and past times, and of other historical, literary, and distinguished personages of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

They first met at the old Artillery Garden, at the top of Artillery Lane, Bishopsgate.

Since their last musters the Court of Aldermen had themselves applied to the Council to increase the number, whereupon the Council had authorized 500 of the better sort of citizens to be trained by the Petitioner in or near the City. The Court of Aldermen had since declined to pay him the 40/. any longer, or any other satisfaction. The Council, by their letter of the last of November to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, concerning the training and mustering of 6,000 citizens, had willed and advised them to use the assistance of some man of experience in furnishing the Companies with fit arms according to the modern use of other nations. The Petitioner therefore prayed the Council to nominate and commend him as an officer to that purpose, willing the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to establish him therein with such fee as the Council should think for an officer of that quality. IV. 25. Letter of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council, in reply to the petition of Captain Panton, stating that such as were trained in the Artillery Garden were volun tary scholars, and followed the practice of Arms only for their pleasure. But every man of his Company (as they were informed) respected his pains more or less with some consideration, which by the increase of 500 had become doubled. The Court of Aldermen had also been benevolent to him out of the City's purse, but never gave him any yearly pension ; nor had they any occasion to charge the City either with any pension to a Captain, or to employ any officer to oversee the City's arms ; for in times past, on all necessary occasions of levies of soldiers, their predecessors had always carefully performed the will and pleasure of their Sovereigns and the orders of the Council with out such assistance ; and now that by the Council's approbation they had quartered the City, and appointed Colonels over the several City Captains, who would take the whole care on themselves, and see that their Companies were furnished with serviceable and fit arms, they hoped the Council would conceive there was much less cause to burden the City with any such officer, nor would the citizens be content to have any such over them. 4th April, 161 5. IV. 29. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council, forwarding a petition presented to them from the Society of Citizens of London, practising arms and military discipline in the Artillery Garden, complaining that William Ham mond, the King's Master Gunner of England, had lately restrained their use of that place, and would not suffer their servants and"], [51, "ARTILLERY COMPANY. 21 armourers to repair there to their Armoury to mend and clean their arms without paying him a great rent for the use of the ground, which had never been demanded before, nor had they been interrupted until lately Hammond had obtained a grant of the said ground from the King, which grant, though intended by Hammond to be for the use of the Society, for which purpose he had cautiously moved the Petitioners to join with him in Petition, and to make a Certificate under their hands on his behalf, yet now having obtained it, he pretended the whole property of the estate and right in the ground was in himself. The Petitioners had complained to the Barons of the Exchequer, who on sight of the grant (from which it appeared upon any controversy he was to submit to the order of the Barons) and certificate of Sir Francis Bacon,1 Attorney-General, had required him to forbear to interrupt them in the use of the said ground until, upon a Bill to be exhibited by him in the Exchequer, other order should be taken ; yet notwithstanding such order he remained obstinate. The Court of Aldermen commended the Petition to the Council's consideration, because they had, by their order of the 3rd July, 1602, approved and allowed the said Society and their exercise of arms in any place in or near the City, and the Court of Aldermen knew no place so fit as the Artillery Garden. They therefore requested the Council to direct that the Petitioners might use the same as formerly, till the difference between them and Hammond should be determined in the Exchequer Court. 3rd May, 1616.

He was the third son of Robert Bacon, of Drinkston, Suffolk, and younger brother of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, the father of Sir Francis Bacon. He was thrice married : his first wife was Mary, daughter of John Gardner, of Grove Place, in the county of Bucks ; his second was Margaret, daughter of William Rawlins, of London, Grocer, widow of Richard Goldston, Alderman and Salter, to whom he was married at St. Dunstan's-in-the-East, August 14th, 1565 ; his third was Anne, widow of Alderman Jackman, and daughter of Humphrey Pakington, Esq., second brother of Sir John Pakington, of Hampton Lovett, Worcestershire, the ancestor of Lord Plampton.

Whitehall, 5th January, 1618. VII. 29. The King's Order upon the controversy between the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and the Company of the Artillery Garden. The King, according to the true meaning of his orders for the first institution of the Company, and to the voluntary submission of both parties, had resolved to take the election of the Captain of the Company into his own hands, and therefore declared the elections made by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and by the Company, of the Captain and all other officers void ; \u2014 further, he had determined that the election of President and all other officers should be in his own hands ; but because he would not at all times be troubled to choose officers, he commanded the Lord Mayor and Aldermen now and hereafter to choose them, save the Captain, except when he should himself think fit to take the pains therein. The Treasurer's place, however, being a particular trust, was to be left to the Company. As it appeared that orders for the government of the Company had not been made, the King, with the advice of his Council, would take steps for the framing of such orders as should be requisite. Lastly, as the King, with the advice of his Council, held it just and reasonable that the authority of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen should be countenanced and upheld in the government of the several parts of the City under His Majesty, and would always approve their fitting endeavours to vindicate the same, so he could not approve the expressions used by word of mouth, and in some petitions by the Company, intimating a consequence of disbanding if their desires were not yielded to, nor the disorders and contentions which appeared in their proceedings.

Such defacement as had happened was very small, and not easily discerned by passers-by unless pointed out to them by those that knew it ; some part had been injured four or five years past, and not marked, and some lately, as it had been thought by light persons who had pilfered a little lead from the arms and crosses in the lower part, which were easiest to break away, and not for any public defacement, which, if they had intended it, would have been done upon the faces of the images. Steps had been taken to find out the offenders, and the reparation of the Cross would be proceeded with. Many strangers and other superstitious people, misliking the State and religion, passing by the Cross knelt down to the images there, and daily gave idolatrous worship thereunto, both in bending their knees, uncovering their heads, and other outward shows of reverence, which matters had been sundry times presented upon the oaths of men sworn in the Bishop's and Archdeacon's visitations, and which were greatly to the offence of God, and to the contempt of the laws and orders of the Church set forth by authority of Her Majesty.

No complaint had been made to the Court of Aldermen of such mixture, which they thought a great argument that no griev ance or inconvenience was found from it. The worst coals were not unmerchantable stuff, being used by lime-burners, brick-makers, and dyers.

In the Letters Patent, however, Newcastle had been described as in the County of York, whereas it was a county of itself, and a question had arisen as to whether they might have allowance of such coals according to the measure of Newcastle. A doubt had also been raised whether the farmers of the Customs could make allowance of the I2d. in the chaldron on the said 4,000 chaldrons without forfeiture of their lease.

The Council finding, by divers complaints and late experience, the excessive rates of coals, and having regard to the great prejudice and danger that might befall the City through the scarcity and want of coals, had thought fit to send to them Captain James Duppra, who had been formerly employed in that service, to advise as to some course for the safety of coal ships by settling a constant convoy for them.

A scheme to enrich the king, produced the farthing token, weighing six grains, and producing 24s.

By a Proclamation issued in 1633, the counterfeiters of these tokens were, upon con viction, to be fined 100/. a piece, to be set on the pillory in Cheapside, and from thence whipped through the streets to Old Bridewell, and there kept to work ; and when enlarged, to find sureties for their good behaviour. On the 3rd of August, 1644, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London petitioned the House of Commons against the inconvenience of this coin, and the hardship suffered by the poor in consequence. No farthing tokens being issued during the Commonwealth, private persons were under the neces sity of striking their own tokens. The practice being, however, contrary to law, was subsequently prohibited by a Proclamation issued August 16th, 1672. It further appears, by an advertisement in the London Gazette, No. 714, September 23rd, 1672, that an office called the \" Farthing Office,\" was opened in Fenchurch Street, near Mincing Lane, for the issue of these coins on Tuesday in each week, and in 1673-4 an order was passed to open the office daily. These measures not proving effectual to prevent private coinage of tokens, another Proclamation was issued October 17th, 1673, and another December 12th, 1674. These farthing tokens encountered the contempt and scorn of all persons to whom they were tendered, as being of the smallest possible value.

For these reasons, and on account of the strange and insufferable clauses of non obstante dispensing with all Acts, Laws, Statutes, Orders, or Ordinances of the King or the Privy Council, Proclama tions, &c, then made or thereafter to be made, the Council, concurring with the Lord Chief Justice, declare the Patent unfit to be put in execution, and order it to be suspended and remain in the Council chest, and also direct the Attorney - General to proceed legally to repeal it, unless the Company voluntarily surrender it.

Of late many journeymen in London, refusing this course of trial, had brought informations in the Exchequer, under the Statute 24th Henry VIII., cap. 5,1 supposing it to be a restraint contrary thereto.

Certain Weavers, free of other Companies, perceiving that these orders might be pressed against them, had appealed to the Court of Aldermen for relief; whereupon both they and the Com pany had been heard by counsel, when it appeared the main question was whether Weavers free of other Companies, and using Silkweaving, were, or ought to be, within the ancient Charter of the Weavers' Company. It was decided by the Court, and assented to by counsel on both sides, that the question should be determined by a friendly legal trial, and the Weavers free of other Companies submitted (how ever the law should decide the question) to such orders for search, government, and apprentices as the Court should think fit. The Weavers' Company, however, had not pursued the matter, nor (so far as the Court knew) had they acquainted the Council with it before the passing of their Lordships' Order above referred to. The Court had, therefore, thought it their duty to represent to the Council that the enforcing of the translation of Weavers free of other Companies to the Company of Weavers would cause much trouble and suits at law, and be a bad example for other Companies, which might be avoided by a friendly trial. If the trial should be against the Com pany, the Court did not doubt that they would be able to settle such orders as to search, government, and apprentices as would neither prejudice the subject nor give the Weavers' Company just cause of complaint.

This Row was erected in 1491, by Thomas Wood, Goldsmith, Sheriff of London. Stow describes it in 1598 as \"the most beautiful frame of fair houses and shops that be within the walls of London, or elsewhere in England. It containeth in number ten fair dwelling-houses and fourteen shops, all in one frame, uniformly builded four stories high, beautified toward the street with the Goldsmith arms and the likeness of Woodmen (in memory of the founder's name) riding on monstrous beasts, all of which is cast in lead, richly painted over and gilt.\" \"This said front was again new painted and gilt over in the year 1594, Sir Richard Martin being then Mayor, and keeping his Mayoralty in one of them.\" \u2014 Stow, edition 1633. \"At this time the City greatly abounded in riches and splendour, such as former ages were unacquainted with. Then it was beautiful to behold the glorious appearance of Goldsmiths' shops in the South Row of Cheapside, which, in a continued course, reached from the Old Change to Bucklersbury, exclusive of four shops only of other trades in all that space.\" Maitland's 'History of London,' edition 1760, vol. i., p. 301. King Charles the First in 1629 issued a Proclamation ordering the Goldsmiths to plant themselves, for the use of their trade, in Cheapside or Lombard Street. The Lords of the Council, in 1637, sent a letter to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen (vide yil, 197), ordering them to close every shop in Cheapside and Lombard Street that did not carry on the trade of a Goldsmith, about twenty-four in all, Grove and one Widow Hill, Stationers; Dover, a' Milliner; Brown, a Band-seller; Sanders, a Dragster ; Medcalfe, a Cook ; Edwards, a Girdler, &c\u2014 Rush worth's ' State Papers.' 2 Regulations made for their government in 1375.

Petition of the Master, Wardens, and Commonalty of the Mysteiy of Pewterers to the Lords of the Council, reciting the late Petition of the Goldsmiths for a Proclamation against abuses and for punishment of offenders, and alleging that Llis Majesty, his nobility, gentry, and commonalty, were wronged by the yearly pilfering of pewter, and that by the defacing, melting, and altering of arms, marks, and ensigns it was utterly lost to the owners. The charge as well of pewter as of plate, jewels, and other things of like conse quence was committed to His Majesty's officers and others in each particular place, which was a thing impossible for them to undergo or discover without some mediate means in that behalf. Many burglaries were committed, and great store of pewter was taken from men's houses by ill-disposed persons, and pawned or sold to brokers, tinkers, braziers, and such like, who, collecting a large quantity, secretly conveyed it in barrels beyond sea, to the hindrance of His Majesty's Customs and his agents, the farmers of tin, and undersold them beyond sea. Anciently the custom was that if any man lost any pewter he should come to the Hall and give notice to the Company's officer, with the marks, whereupon the goods were stayed and restored to the owners, and the parties punished ; but this custom, by reason of covert and underhand dealing, was not now known. It was always intended that the Pewterers should be included in the Goldsmiths' Petition for a Proclamation, and they prayed that they might be inserted accordingly.

The King had therefore granted a Patent 2 to Richard Giles and his deputies, and had given him a yearly fee for taking all such false and deceivable woods. Since the Statute directed all such woods to be burnt, by the authority and direction of the Magistrate, where they were taken, the Lord Treasurer requested the Lord Mayor to take into his charge all such woods found or taken in the Port of London, by the said Giles or others, and to take order that they might be burnt in some public place within the City. 22nd November, 161 5.

Therefore, in order that all falsehood in dyeing might be banished, which was the main hindrance of the sale of so royal a commodity in foreign parts, His Majesty required that view should be taken, and search made, according to the Statute 5th Edward VI., by Symon Stevenson, already authorized by the Lord Mayor for that purpose, and Robert Brabent, whom the King required should be joined with him, of all cloths and other woollen commodities in any place or places within the City and 1 This probably refers to the Statute 23 Elizabeth, c. 9.

V. 34. Certificate from the Lord Mayor and Recorder, to the King, in answer to a Petition referred to them concerning false dyed silk, stating that they had had conferences with divers silkmen, dyers, and weavers, and found that much deceit had been practised in the dyeing of silk, by adding deceitful mixtures to increase its weight, but that this abuse had latterly been greatly reformed by divers Acts of Common Council, and by the care of the Magistrates in putting them into execution. That His Majesty had been pleased to issue his proclamation in the tenth year of his reign,1 for a general reformation of all such abuses. They were of opinion that, by virtue of these laws and His Majesty's Proclamation, the abuses might be sufficiently reformed, without the erection of an office for that purpose. As to the proposal to erect an office for the weighing of undyed silk from the Merchant or Silkman, to the Dyer, and back again, at a beam and scales, to be provided in some fit place in the City or suburbs, with a fee of twopence for registering and weighing every pound of dyed silk, they could not see that such a course could work any reformation. Moreover, the City was already interested in the office of weighing of all manner of silks, dyed and undyed, with the fees and profits thereto belonging, and the payment of twopence per pound on all silks to be dyed, would only endear the commodity, without reforming the abuses. They further certify that, as to the proposed Proclamation to be issued by His Majesty \u2014 1st. That no dyed silk should be imported, on pain of forfeiture. It would prejudice His Majesty in his Customs, \u2014 would be against trade and commerce, and would hinder the vendino- of the commodities of the kingdom, especially cloth, for which silk was often taken and returned in exchange. 2nd.

Letter of the Lord Mayor in reply, stating that the steeple had been lately impaired and demolished by one Henry Robinson, who bought it of the Marquis of Winchester,2 and, pretending it was so decayed that it could not be repaired, nor stand without danger to the inhabitants (which appeared otherwise to the Lord Mayor, by the view and report of divers very skilful workmen), set men to pull it down. Being commanded by the Lord Mayor to desist, he had proceeded the more speedily, and had denied passage to the officers sent to stay his workmen. He had cut and taken away a great quantity of the lead and timber, and thereby much impaired the steeple. For his contempt, and other unreverent speech and behaviour, the Lord Mayor had committed him to Newgate, where he would remain till he put in sufficient surety to make good what he had abated and pulled down. As he had threatened pro ceeding at law, the Lord Mayor requested to be informed of the pleasure of the Council in the matter. He hoped the Council would not desire to take the burden from others to whom it properly belonged, and throw it upon the City. The Dutch Congregation were very many in number, and a great part of them very wealthy and able persons, zealous in religion.

But it being .sold to a private individual, who bought it to make benefit, it must necessarily come down, if they did not accept a second offer made by Robinson, viz., to repay him within a fortnight the money the steeple and some ground and buildings adjacent cost him, the expenses incurred in pulling down so much of it as had been demolished, and the other expenses he had sustained. 19th February, 161 2.

Besides the large number of scholars that were provided for in the Universities, both by the Companies and by particular Citizens, they likewise maintained sundry free scholars at great charge. They had also contributed liberally to the col lections for repairing of Havens, loans for Jernemothc, gatherings for the building of the great Church of Bath, provisions of grain, &c.

Answer of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to the fore- going Petition, reciting that the City of London had had, time out of mind, and still possessed, the Portage of all things measurable brought into the Port of London ; that the Company of Porters of London had been time out of mind a fraternity called the Billingsgate Porters ; that they were bound on all occasions to attend that service, and to carry corn to His Majesty's granaries ; they were all freemen of the City, and, before being allowed to work, had to find suf- ficient sureties for their good conduct. They only took for that service the amount settled by Act of Common Council,1 in th'e Mayoralty of Sir William Cockayne, and the Lord Mayor required nothing but the orderly performance of the Act of Common Council, which all the Petitioners willingly observed. The privilege of Portage being so ancient a right of the City, and one upon which the liveli- hood of so many poor freemen and their families depended (there being about 300 or 400 of the fraternity), the Court of Aldermen prayed that it might not be interrupted by the suggestion of a few turbulent persons, who, out of will rather than any just ground, presumed to trouble the Council in a business so well settled.

Letter signed Edward Nicholas, by command of the King (Charles the Second), to the Lord Mayor, stating that the late King, in the year 1632, established a Society of Fishers, and that Philip, late Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery and his associates caused sundry fishing-vessels to be provided, which employed many families, in making nets, &c, and taught the country youths to be serviceable mariners, as by the book 2 called the Royal Herring Buss Fishing, presented to him, plainly appeared. That being informed there were a number of poor families and vagrants who, for want of employment, were likely to perish, unless some speedy care were taken for their relief, and that the several wards and suburbs of the City were burdened with a multitude of poor people, he recommended the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to cause the Wardmote Inquests to give in particulars of all the poor inhabitants within each Ward, and to 1 Mercer, elected Sheriff, 24th June, 1637 ; chosen Alderman of Farringdon Within, September 13th, 1638 ; removed to Lime Street, June 16th, 1642 ; removed to Bridge, May nth, 1658 ; Lord Mayor in 1644 ; was one of the Commissioners appointed by the House of Commons for the trial of King Charles the First ; President of Christ's Hospital, 1660. He was an Alderman of the City of Norwich (vide \" Sheriffs,\" Letter viii. 195), and served the office of Sheriff of that city in 1627. He also represented it in Parliament, 1639-40. Upon his being chosen Sheriff of London he requested to be discharged from his Aldermanship at Norwich, which was complied with. \u2022 The Dutch carried on the principal trade in fishing. Sir Walter Raleigh said, in 1603, that the four great towns on the Baltic in one year realised 620,000/. for herrings, while England did not send a boat. In 1614, Tobias, a fisherman of some repute, published a pamphlet, entitled ' The best Way to make England the Richest and Wealthiest Kingdom in Europe,' in which he recommended the construction of 1,000 busses upon a \"national design,\" each ward in London to provide one, also each of the civic companies and parishes. He estimated that a busse measuring sixty to eighty tons, complete with all her fishing implements and appurtenances, would cost about 500/.

The busses might all go forth to the Island of Shetland, to the fishing grounds, according to certain pre scribed Orders in the aforesaid Book. He would recommend the same to all cities and towns throughout the kingdom, so as to make it a national employment. 23rd July, 1660. FOREIGN BOUGHT AND SOLD. I. 14.

The Council had been creditably informed that the like trade had been carried on for the space of eighty years and upwards, and had never hitherto been hindered.

In the' course of the year 1595, the differences between the City and the authorities of the Tower, as to the Tower Liberties, caused a serious riot, which Sir John, with the Sword Bearer and other officers, went to suppress. Sir John kept his Mayoralty at his town residence, Crosby Place. He was President of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1603-9. He died March 30th, 1609, and was buried at St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, where a tomb is erected to his memory. From his great wealth, he was called \"Rich Spencer.\" His only daughter, Elizabeth, married, in 1594, William, second Lord Compton, Lord President of Wales, from which marriage the present Earls of Northampton are descended. At his death he is said to have left a fortune variously asserted at from 500,000/. to 800,000/. In 1603, the French Ambassador, Monsieur da Rosney, Great Treasurer of France, was entertained by Sir John Spencer at Crosby Place. See a curious note in 'The Progresses of King James I.', by John Nichols, vol. i., pages 159-160. 1 In the early part of the seventeenth century, towards the close of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a revolt against the Crown of England broke out in the Province of Ulster. After considerable resistance, the rebels were overcome, and finally attainted of high treason, and their possessions, consisting of six counties, were, in tha reign of James the First, escheated to the Crown, by Act of Parliament, as forfeited property. King James determined to establish a colony of English and Scottish Protestants upon the escheated lands. With a view to carry out his object, he applied to the City of London, offering to grant to the citizens a large portion of the forfeited estates. The City ultimately undertook the Planta tion \u2022 for which purpose a charter was granted to them, March 29th, 1613.

The City had, by Charter of King John, the Sheriffwick of London and Middlesex, for which they paid to the King 360/ per annum. The principal means of raising this sum was by the toll on cattle coming to the markets, and the proposed markets and fairs, if allowed, would disable the City from raising their rent.

Patents for making saltpetre were expressly exempted, in 1624, from the Statute against Monopolies (21 Jac. I. c. 3, s. 10), and the saltpetreman was empowered to break open all premises, and to dig up the floors of stables, and even dwelling-houses. This privilege was so unscrupulously exercised, that we read in Archbishop Laud's ' Diary ' (1624, December 13th) that the \" Saltpeterman had digged in the Colledge Church of Brecknock for his work, bearing too bold upon his Commission.\" Charles the First, in 1625, and again in 1634, commanded, by Proclamation, that no dovehouse or stable should be paved, but should lie open for the growth of saltpetre, and that none should presume to hinder any saltpetreman from digging where he thought proper. The vexation and oppression of the King's subjects by the saltpetremen is specially mentioned in the famous ' Remonstrance of the State of the Kingdom,' in 1641, and no effectual remedy was applied until 1656, when it was enacted that no saltpetreman should dig within any houses or lands without previously obtaining the leave of the owner.

Attempts had been made to introduce the manufacture into England in 161 1. Burlomachi, the great capitalist of that time, at the request of Lady Bedford, brought over a French woman, Madame Furatta, who engaged to give lessons in the art. Under the patronage of Lady Bedford, Dike, Fowle, Hum, Phipps, and Dade applied successfully for a Patent for the making, which was granted May 21st, 161 1. Lady Bedford was to receive 1,000/. for her share in the arrangement. Attempts being made to infringe it, Sir Hemy Montague, Recorder of London, imprisoned offenders, and took away their tools, &c. A new Patent being applied for, it was opposed with considerable success, and was not granted until January 10th, 1616. It was then granted toDike, Fowle, and Dorrington, who agreed to paythe King a rent equal to the sum obtained from the duty upon importation. Great resistance was raised by the Goldsmiths to this Patent, and it was brought before the Privy Council. After considerable discussion, it was determined by the King to take it into his own hands, making Fowle the agent of the Crown. A Proclamation, authorizing this arrangement, was issued, March 22nd, 1618. This led to serious steps being taken to thwart the Patent. In 1619 several silk-mercers were committed to the Fleet, when four Aldermen offered to stand bail for them for 100,000/. ; the King therefore set them at liberty.

Copy of Petition of Captain Henry Bell to the Lord Mayor, stating that (upon His Majesty's promise made to him for the granting of any reasonable suit he might be able to find out), having spent a great part of his means in soliciting and seeking after suits, he had at last hit upon one, not only very reasonable, but also most necessary for His Majesty's realms and subjects. His Majesty had lately been credibly certified, by letters from divers parts beyond seas, of the extraordinary defectiveness and falsehood of English lead, which had hitherto been far better than any other, but for some years past had been far worse, not only to the great disgrace and prejudice of that commodity beyond seas, but also to the great damage and hurt of His Majesty's subjects at home, as appeared by the Petition from the Company of Plumbers to His Majesty, instantly craving reformation of this great abuse. The Petitioner, therefore, prayed that Letters Patent l for thirty-one years, might be granted to him and his sufficient deputies, with full power to survey all lead made within the realms, and to stamp the same to distinguish the good from the bad ; to prevent the sale or exportation of unstamped lead, to turn the false and defective lead back to the makers, or else to be fined and forfeited, one moiety to the King, and the other to the Patentee.

Theobalds, 20th December, 161 8. V. 3. Letter from the Commissioners for Suits to the Lord Mayor, enclosing Copy of the above Petition. As they knew no better means of ascertaining the convenience of the suit than by examining those who dealt and traded in lead, they had written to the Company of Plumbers, and they requested that he would be good enough to send to them two or three merchants who dealt in that commodity abroad, and who were able to inform them upon the subject.

Whitehall, 15th February, 1618. V. 17. Letter from Captain Henry Bell to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, expressing his surprise at the statements in their Certificate to the Commissioners for Suits against his Patent, that they had examined certain merchants dealing in lead, both here and abroad, who had alleged they never heard of abuses in the manufac ture of that commodity, although they were so apparent, and had been complained of to the King by his Ambassadors. He thought it strange the Court had not examined the Master and Wardens of the Plumbers' Company, who had constantly maintained and affirmed the abuses to be great, and to require immediate reformation. He therefore requested them to examine all parties upon oath, and offered, if his suit should be proved prejudicial to the King, realm, or subject, or even should not be found good and profitable to all, not only to disclaim and renounce his Patent, but also all right and title thereto. 6th March, 161 8. V. 18. Copy of Letter from the Commissioners for Suits to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, stating that they were in a good forward ness to come to a conclusion as to the suit for a Patent for the survey and sealing of lead. They had received two Certificates, one from the"], [252, "222 MONOPOLIES. Merchants, and the other from the Plumbers' Company, copies of which they enclosed, testifying the abuse to be very apparent, and that they suffered great loSs thereby. The Plumbers had also exhibited before them some fluggy and drossy stuff, which they said was ordinarily known to be enclosed in pigs and sows of lead. On the other side, it appeared by the report of certain Aldermen, who had called sundry Merchants before them, that they never heard of such com plaints, and that English lead was the best and most merchantable in all Christendom. Since, therefore, they found merchant against merchant, and plumber against plumber, they entreated the Lord Mayor and Aldermen again to hear all the parties, and use the means which to their wisdom should seem best to ascertain the truth, and to inform them whether the abuse existed, and to certify their opinions as to the reformation desired by the Petition. 8th March, 1618. V. 20. Letter from Captain Bell to the Lord Mayor, stating that he had bought at the quay three fodders of lead, which he intended to have melted and weighed in the presence of credible men, and requesting the Lord Mayor to appoint one or two of his officers or others, to attend at the house of a Plumber named William Halsey, in Fleet Street, to see it melted, that he might be informed of the waste thereof, which would end all further doubts and disputes.

Letter from Sir Julius C\u00e6sar, Master of the Rolls, to the Lord Mayor, stating that he had received a letter from the Marquis of Buckingham concerning the suit of Captain Bell. Since the Commissioners only waited for the Lord Mayor's Certificate, he entreated it might be sent before their meeting on the following afternoon, that the truth might clearly appear, and Captain Bell have no just cause further to complain.

Petition of John Bludworth, and Edward Darling, Vintners, and Gilbert Morewood, Grocer, on behalf of themselves and divers other Citizens dealing in lead, to the Lord Mayor (Sir Sebastian Harvey) and Court of Aldermen, against the Patent of Captain Bell concerning the searching and sealing of lead, for which two pence per hundred, which was 3^. 6d. per fother, was desired. The traders in lead knew very well there was no cause for granting any such Patent, it being unknown that any tares or abatements had ever been made in respect of falsifying. On the contrary, English lead had the priority of sale in all foreign parts, and the intended project was con ceived to be not for the common good of the kingdom, but for private"], [253, "MONOPOLIES. 223 ends. Considering that~2Ctf. impost was already laid upon lead, being one of the three staple- commodities of the kingdom, and 8s. for custom, if this third were added, it was thought it would render English lead less vendible, and other nations would undersell them, and so manyjDoor people working in lead mines would want employ ment, and the Customs would be much impaired.

They therefore requested them to call the Petitioners and the Patentees before them, and, after hearing them, to settle and determine reasonable rates for such commodities and for the removal of future complaints, and certify their proceedings to the Council. 15th March, 1621. V. 134. Petition from sundry merchants trading in lead to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, reciting that they had obtained a letter from the Court to the town of Hull for redress of new and unaccustomed impositions laid upon lead in that town, to which the Court had received an answer justifying the same, and considering it a favour that they took no more. They found, from their factor at Hull, that, by ancient accounts, until the year 1600 the rate was 22//., and when most, 2s., for ten pigs ; whereas now 2s. for eight pigs was levied and taken, and there might be no limitation unless the Court gave speedy remedy to this growing evil. They therefore prayed them either to press the town of Hull to a present abatement of the im position, or, if the Petitioners were to be driven to legal proceedings, to direct the City Solicitor to follow it, with allowance of the charge of suit, as usual in similar cases.

His Majesty thought their propositions reasonable, if they could substantiate them, but, as he understood the Soap Boilers of London had appealed to the Court of Alder men for assistance, and had alleged the soap made by the appli cants was unmerchantable and unserviceable, he desired the Court to call before them such Citizens as they should think fit, and also the said Gentlemen and the Soap Boilers, and in their presence put the new sort of soap to trial, and ascertain whether it was as good as the best soft soap ordinarily made, and return their answer to His Majesty within ten days.

It was not so fit for fine linen as the ordinary soft soap, for, as they were informed, it fretted, wore, and consumed the linen. (1624.) VI. 121.

The Court of Aldermen so far assented to the Goldsmiths' Petition as to be suitors to the Council that they would take the matter into consideration and grant a public hearing of the cause, that so they might mediate with the King for the suppression of the Patent in case it should appear to them inconvenient and grievous to the Commonwealth in general, or the ancient and useful Company of Goldsmiths in particular.

They had conferred with the Wardens of the Fishmongers, and they found here but a small quantity of foreign salt. It was thought the Fishermen of the ports of the kingdom would sell 5,000 weighs of salt, at least, by the 20th April next, besides the inland sale. Of late years, salt was sold for 30s. to 32s. the weigh, which was then thought a high price. It was now often sold for 40s. and more. It had been alleged in the Petition that the subjects of Scotland, before and since the restraint, transported white salt to foreign parts, but the Court conceived there was no such necessity, by sea or land, for the use of it as in England. If the merchants were licensed to export the salt already made, the fishermen would be forced to stay the making of new salt, and to take it hot out of the pans, to the spoil of the fish, loss of time, and overthrowing of their voyage.

As many Masters, Mariners, and Seamen belonging to the Port of London had houses, and dwelt within the Liberties of the City, it had been thought good that orders should be given to every Alderman of the City to make search, by himself or his deputy, in his ward, and put in writing the names and parishes where they dwelt, and forward the same to the Serjeant of the Admiralty. 15th December, 1580.

The Council had cause to hope that by this time all the shires in the realm were well and sufficiently provided with convenient furniture, and able and skilful men, to be ready, upon accident, to serve Her Majesty- and their country, and had, therefore, been the more ready to accede to this request. To the intent that it might not seem to be a peculiar favour, showed only to those shires which desired to be eased of that yearly charge, but common to all, even as the burden and charge had been, they had thought it convenient to signify to the Justices that they might from henceforth forbear the training of the soldiers allotted to them, until otherwise directed, taking, nevertheless, good and substantial order that, upon any occasion of service, the number of the trained men should be in readiness, and their furniture well kept. 20th May, 1582.

The Committees had brought in the names of divers men who refused to make any allowance, among them appeared Mr. Morgan, Her Majesty's Apothecary, and Mr. Bestow, her Turner, men of known wealth. He therefore requested that charge might be made to the said parties to pay the sums assessed upon them, or that proceeding should be taken against them according to the custom of the City. Upon visiting the several bounds, according to order, the controversy between the City and the Tower had been again revived. He therefore requested that a Commission of indifferent men should be appointed under the Great Seal, to hear and determine the controversy. 3rd June, 1592. I. 594. Letter from the Committees appointed by the Common Council to the Lord Mayor, stating that they had received the answer of the Lord High Admiral to the articles set down, and desired to be agreed to by the Common Council, touching certain necessary points to be observed on their behalf.1 Finding some difference between his Lordship's answer and the said Articles, in some material points, the Committee had thought it right to note the same, and to remind the Lord Mayor of what had passed at the general assembly, viz. :\u2014 That they willingly yielded to furnish six ships and one pinnace, for this present service, upon condition that the Articles might likewise be accepted and ratified by Her Majesty, under which conditions, and not otherwise, the Common Council had agreed to lay this burden and service upon the Committee, to see the said ships furnished with all speed.

Letter from the Court of Aldermen to the Lords bf the Council, stating that they had received Her Majesty's pleasure touching the levy of money for furnishing of soldiers and other necessary uses for her service, in which the privileged and exempt places within the City had been charged to contribute ; this they had refused to do, to the great dissatisfaction of the rest of the Citizens. The Court requested the Council to again signify to them, in some more earnest manner, that all such charges and con tributions of money for the public service should be levied rateably upon the inhabitants within the said privileged and exempt places, as well as without, as also upon all strangers and foreigners not charged for the like service in any other place. The privileged places had been made sanctuaries for all who were unwilling to serve, and who resorted there to protect themselves when any press of soldiers was made, whereby the City had been driven to take those less fitted for service. The Court of Aldermen, therefore, requested ' that order might be given to subject such privileged places to such levies as the rest of the City. 6th July, 1591. I. 596.

The City had had a conference with the Commissioners appointed by Her Majesty, who were of opinion that neither in equity nor in the words of the articles signed ought the ships which departed home from under the govern ment of Lord Thomas Howard, before the coming of the West India Fleet, to be reckoned within this consortment, or to have any share or partition in this purchase. 20th December, 1592, I. 620.

Four night walkers were taken upon London Bridge, and committed to the Poultry Compter. Mr. Sergeant Small wood complained that the said number of 100 men could not be furnished, and requested that the compters and prisons might be surveyed, and that he might have such able men as were not in prison for debt. Thereupon the said sergeant, assisted by the authorities, made such survey, and took such men as were fit for service, among them those taken on the bridge, undertaking that, if they proved themselves to be any honest men's servants, he would surrender them.

Lastly, \u2014 In the assessment for this service, all the inhabitants of the City and Liberties, except noblemen, though not free of the City, should be contributory, according to their estates within the City and Liberties only, and not in other counties, for which they would be liable in such counties.

The defence of the kingdom was not a matter to be disputed upon, nor the manner of it governed by ordinary rules of private cases. He had received instructions, out of apprehension of their backwardness, which he trusted might never be put in execution. The Lord Mayor might make such use of the letter among his private friends as he thought fit, so that the writer was not prejudiced. (Circa 1624-5.) VI. 72. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, reciting that they had received by some of the Aldermen, a denial, in the name of the City, to their late letter for the setting forth of shipping for the defence of the kingdom, and the excuses made they could not truly impute to anything but want of duty. They therefore, in His Majesty's name and by his command, required them to see the directions of their letter performed, upon their allegiance, and as they would answer the contrary at their peril.

That no delay might occur to frustrate his design, the Lord High Admiral was commanded to give them authority to take such ships (to the number above mentioned) as should be fittest for the purpose, and to press as many mariners and others as should be needful. As he aimed at nothing but the public safety of the State and religion, in which the City of London had as great an interest as any other member of his dominions, he did not doubt of their ready obedience and full performance of their duty to God, their King, and country. Westminster, ist September, 2 Charles I. (1626). VI. 93. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor, reciting that, by a Certificate from the Commissioners of the Navy and those of the Trinity House, assisted by persons appointed by the Lord Mayor, according to their letters of the 7th inst., they found that, for the guarding and securing of the River Thames, it was con sidered that, besides the defence thereof by land, ten Newcastle ships, of 200 tons burden and upwards, ought to be provided, to be furnished with twelve demi-culverins, or sakers,1 at least, and manned by thirty men apiece, part of them at the mouth of the river below Leigh, and part at Tilbury Hope. As it appeared that upon former similar cause of danger, four galleys were provided, and the City of London had borne the charge of furnishing and maintaining two of them, the Council thought it just that the same course should be now adopted by an equal division of the charges between the King and the City of London. They therefore required the Lord Mayor to take order that five of the ten ships should be, with all convenient expedition, furnished and maintained by the City in the same manner as the other five should be at His Majesty's charge.

They did not, moreover, conceive the service such as concerned them otherwise than the whole kingdom, the defence of which was a regal work. The Council had instanced the two galleys built in Queen Elizabeth's time, but they were ordered by Act of Common Council, in the time of an open invasion, and con tinued but a while, the City, also, being then in a far better estate than now by a third part at least ; yet so much exclamation followed, that they doubted whether an Act of Common Council for what was now required could be obtained. (Circa 1625.) VI. 96. Letter from the King, under signet, to the Lord Mayor, stating that he had cause to depress the disorders with which the City and parts about it were threatened by mariners and seamen, who, in tumultuous manner, had come through the City to the Court, to demand money, notwithstanding that they were well in clothes and had victuals, and had his Royal word, by his principal officers, that they should be paid. Nevertheless, they mutinously persisted to capitulate with him, which gave him just cause to think they intended some other or further mischief. He therefore required the Lord Mayor to assemble two, three, or four companies of the Trained Bands, and place them at the gates, and other convenient places, to stop any mariners or seafaring men, or others who sought to pass in a tumultuous manner into the suburbs, or towards the Court, and if he heard of any assemblies of such persons in an inordinate manner in the City or suburbs, to send some discreet person there, with force to disperse or apprehend them, and if they resisted or offered force, to endeavour, by shot or other weapons, to depress them. This letter should be his authority and discharge for any action or accident that might happen. Westminster, 2nd February, 2 Charles I. (1626). VI. 97.

Considering our religion, liberties, lives, and estates, were therein no less interested than His Majesty's safety and honour, he could not doubt that all his loving subjects would show their forward ness and courage in performing no less (or rather more) than had been formerly done. As these great occasions required all the strength and power of the Navy, and also the arming of a consider able number of his subjects' ships, he had, to make the burden more easy, commanded such a distribution to be made among the ports and coast towns, that most help should be required from the places of most power. Therefore, it was appointed that the City should set to sea twenty of the best ships in the river, victualled for three months. If seamen were wanted to supply the requisite number, the Lord Mayor might employ some Watermen among them, and might employ a third part of strong and able-bodied men, fit only to use muskets, for levy of whom a sufficient commission should be issued. When the ships were ready, they were to be hastened to the rendezvous at Portsmouth, at the latest by the 4th of September. Whitehall, 4th August, 1626. VI. 101. Letter from the King, under signet, to the Lord Mayor, stating he was informed that divers Companies appointed to be brought to a rendezvous at the Port of London, to be sent for the service of his uncle, the King of Denmark, were defective in number, and could only be supplied by a press, to be made in the City, and requiring him to give directions for levying 100 men accordingly, to be disposed of agreeably to the orders to be sent by the Privy Council.

As he conceived the proportions allotted for the service would be insufficient, he had given way to a contribution of 6d. per chaldron on coals, to be transported from Newcastle and Sunderland to any other part of his dominions, or to foreign parts, to be levied by free consent, to supply the deficiencies of the revenues aforesaid, and to be employed only for the special service mentioned.

The matter had been brought before the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council, where Mr. Randolph had been moved to consent to pass over the execution of his office, by deputa tion to Mr. C\u00e6sar. He had in both Courts delivered openly his answer in tears, declaring his desire to remain and to die an officer of the City, and his most humble petition that intercession might be made for him to Her Majesty, not to command him to be removed. The Common Council were not desirous to make alteration in his case, but to be humble petitioners for him to Her Majesty. With regard to Dr. C\u00e6sar, however otherwise he might bc qualified for the efficient performance of the office, it would be necessary that the officer should understand the Common Laws of the Realm, by which City cases were governed, and not by the Civil Laws.

(1638). The language of the Charter appears to suggest that it was then newly established, although the above letter and other evidence prove it already existed. The duties of the office are stated in the Charter to embrace the selling of household stuff, apparel, leases of houses, jewels, goods, chattels, and other things of all persons willing that the officer should sell them by public and open cry, commonly called outcry, in open places in the City and Liberties, and the Town and Borough of Southwark. Norton, in his ' Commentaries on the Histoiy, Constitution, &c, of the City of London,' p. 401, says : \" The term outroper, or outrouper, like that of bankrupt, seems to be derived from the breaking up (ruptum) of stock ; though as applied to the public selling of effects by crying them out, the etymology of the word is somewhat more intricate and involved. The word, and probably the office too, is more ancient than this Charter, which professes to create it, for the officer called the common ciyer is perhaps as ancient as the City. The classical reader need hardly be reminded of the importance of the ciyer in the earlier ages of democratic states, as testified in the character of Homer's Stentor, and of Tolmides, in Xenophon's 'Anabasis.' It may be presumed that a similar duty was performed by the ciyer of London. It was his task to summon the councils, and call for order in their deliberations. It continues so to the present clay, and whoever attends the civic assemblies will still find his voice the most audible, if not the most attended lo. His duty, as outroper, was that of an auctioneer broker, the performance of which in open places detracted in no small degree from his ancient and also his modern dignity. This has, however, long ago ceased to be noticed in the list of his duties, as the change of the times has produced improvements in public sales, and indeed the legality of this exclusive grant by charter of such an office may be reasonably doubted.\" U"], [320, "29O OFFICES AND OFFICERS. to the office of Chief Clerk to the Secondary of the Compter in Wood Street, if there should bc no just exception against him.

Some thirty years before, at the request of his father, then an Alderman,1 a grant had been made to the said John Martin, of the reversion of some of the principal offices in the City, requiring great skill and ability, to which an express condition was attached that he should take no benefit therefrom unless he should be thought by the Court of Aldermen for the time being fit and able for such place as should first fall vacant, and unless he should in the mean time apply himself to the study of the Common Law. About six years since, Mr. Francis Morgan,2 Reader of the Middle Temple, one of the Judges of the Sheriffs' Court, surrendered his office, and Martin, as next in reversion, should have succeeded him. Having, however, taken no degree in Law, but betaken himself to martial affairs, the Court of Aldermen could not so neglect their duty as to leave a place of Judicature unsupplied for one who was known to bc altogether insufficient, but, according to former precedents, forjudged him of the place as incapable of it, whereby his reversion became void by his own defect, and Sir Edward Mosely (since appointed Attorney of the Duchy of Lancaster), the next in reversion, was admitted to the office, and still held it.

The result was that a Royal Commission was appointed to consider what measures should be taken towards restoring the church, removing the houses built too close to it, and in what way the necessary funds should be raised. The Lord Mayor of London was the first person named in the Commission. Inigo Jones was the architect. The raising of the fund would appear to have been a difficult task, nothing was done for eight years. Charles the First issued another Commission, dated April 10th, 1631, and the Chamberlain was appointed treasurer. Among the contributors, Sir Paul Pindar, the wealthy merchant of Bishopsgate, is mentioned\u2014 the total sum contributed by him amounted to about 10,000/. Charles the Second issued a Commission for the repairs of the church, soon after his restoration, April iSth, 1663, and gave J, 000/. towards the funds. Sir Christopher Wren was appointed architect, and one of the Commissioners. Wren presented his report for repairing the cathedral, May 1st, 1666, which was agreed to on Monday, August 27th, 1666, but on Sunday, September 2nd, the great fire broke out, which destroyed the cathedral, and put an end to all plans for its restoration.

Some of the officers of the Church seemed to guess that the bulk of the Church ought to be repaired by the Bishop ; he had never heard that to be true, nor did he think it reasonable, for in divers other cathedral churches (of the old foundation, as St. Paul's was,) the Bishop had no such charge, neither would almost the whole revenue of the bishopric serve for it. He thought rather that the building was a public work, at the alms of the whole realm, and that the Bishops had made general collections from time to time for its repair, and so it might have been thought the Bishop's charge, whereas it was the donation of the people. He requested his lordship and the rest not to urge him any further than his predecessors in the matter. Fulham, 12th October, 1581. I. 286. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Bishop of London in reply. The reason the report of such as had surveyed the Church of St. Paul and the defects in its reparation had been for warded to him, was their good will to him, not to increase his burdens, but rather friendly to prepare him against a communication which he might receive from the Lords of the Council. He begged him to cause his Registrars, officers and accountants to look into such records, accounts, and remembrances as would inform him and the Council in that behalf, not for his discharge only, but to ascertain to whom the charge belonged. Among other notes he would find in the report of Bishop Bonner's proceedings against Mr .Phillpott, in the Book of Acts and Monuments of the Church, an account by that Bishop of the yearly charge to him for the reparations. As for the accounts of the former contributions and the employment thereof, which he advised should be taken, they were ready to be shown. Being particularly advised by the Lord Treasurer, and also admonished by Her Majesty and the Council, to use all good means for the stay of the infection, they requested that he would give advice to the preachers to publicly confute the indiscreet error of tempting God by the whole resorting to the sick where no special office, charge, or duty, required them to do so. 17th October, 1581.

Though it pertained not to the charge of the City, yet being in the nature of a public monument, and seeing that the burden by delay would grow so great, on account of the insufficiency of those that ought to repair it, and that the City and the whole realm, or at least the whole province of Canterbury, especially the clergy, would bc drawn in by necessity to contribute towards the reparation, they had, at clivers times, sent and written to the Bishop (of London), praying him to do the repairs which belonged to him, or to inform the City to whom it appertained to prevent the ruin, that, by the advice of Her Majesty and her Council, means might be taken to supply their inability. The Bishop, in his answers, removed the whole charge from himself in part to the common state, and in part to the Archbishop and his other prede cessors. The City understood that his grace, while Bishop of London, not only gave largely of his own, but, like his predecessors, had liberally borne some ordinary and yearly charge. In order to place the matter clearly before the Council, it would be very advantageous if his grace would give the City a speedy answer, with his opinion to whom the charge of reparation belonged, and what he had bestowed, and how the yearly accounts of himself, his predecessors, and their officers, might bc seen for the City's information. \u2014 April, 1582. I. 327. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Bishop ofLondon, stating that, having considered the great ruin of St. Paul's Church likely to ensue, and the desirability of causing it to be repaired at once, he thought it right again to remind him of the advice given to him by the late Lord Mayor, and to acquaint him that the City would be obliged to bring the subject to the notice of the Privy Council, when it might be that they, finding the body of the church had been repaired, and newly covered and leaded at the public charge, especially of the City, would report that those to whose charge it pertained should have kept it from any notable decay, by the daily oversight of their officers ; this not having been done, it had grown into a great peril, both to the building and Her Majesty's subjects walking there. He prayed him to examine the officers and accountants of his pre decessors, and the rest of the accounts, in order that some light might be thrown upon the question as to whom the charge of the repairs belonged, and if it should be to him, and more than he could surmount (which might perhaps be thought otherwise), that the Privy Council might take means to supply the deficiency, and ordain a future remedy. \u2014 April, 1582."], [356, "326 Paul's, st., cathedral of.

Such notable public monuments had at first been erected not by private individuals, but by common charity and devotion of cities and countries, and so they should be maintained and repaired at common charge of the same. It could not be found throughout all England that the Bishop had been charged with any such matter, for if such persons and pastors were charged at all in common benefices, it would be only with the Chancel, and not with what was called the Navis Ecclesi\u00e6, as appeared by divers statutes. He did not see why bishops, being the chief pastors, should be charged with the body of the chief church. He denied the right of the Lord Mayor to call for the accounts. If the Privy Council should deem it good to call for them, the matter should be moved to the Arch bishop of Canterbury, the then incumbent, and the executors of his agent, Dr. Watts.! 28th April, 1582.

As for the accounts of the former charges bestowed upon the Church, they should be demanded of the late surveyors and auditors of the works who were appointed by order from former Lord Mayors and Aldermen of the City. As to the answer of the Bishop of London, removing the charge from himself to the writer, and to his successor the Archbishop of York, he would only answer for himself, that he did in his time as much, or more, than either by law or reason he was bound. The law could not bind the province of Canterbury to con tribute to the re-edifying of St. Paul's, \u2014 Canterbury being the Metro politan Church, and St. Paul's only a cathedral.

A great mishap had happened at Paris Gardens, by the fall of a scaffold, whereby a great number of people were hurt, and some killed.1 This he attributed to the hand of God, on account of the abuse of the Sabbath-day ; and he requested the Lord Treasurer to give order for the redress of such contempt of God's service. i Sth January, 1582.

Letter from the Lord Treasurer to the Lord Mayor, acknowledging the receipt of his letters of the 14th and 15th instant, and returning the calendar of names of houses infected, com piled by Mr. Norton, in order that steps might bc taken to increase its brevity, and add the names of the houses at the bars at Holborn, andthentohave.it fixed up in the places named. The. officers of Westminster should be communicated with, in order that they might use the same form of certificate, and include the houses or chambers let out for lodgings in the streets and lanes leading to Westminster. With reference to the disaster at Paris Gardens, he would bring the matter before the Council, and get some general order passed pro hibiting such exhibitions. In the mean time he recommended the Lord Mayor, with the advice of the Aldermen, to issue a general order to every Ward, for the prevention of such profane assemblies on the Sabbath-day. With regard to the high price and scarcity of grain, he would issue orders to the several ports to prevent its trans portation, and he desired the Lord Mayor to prevent its shipment out of the port of London. 15th January, 1582. I. 497. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, &c. The infection had much increased, aud the Council were moved again to press upon them the commands of Her Majesty, that they should see that all infected houses were shut up, and provision made to feed and maintain the sick persons therein, and for preventing their going abroad ; that all infected houses were marked, the streets thoroughly cleansed, and a sufficient number of discreet persons appointed to see the same done.

Inquisition should be made of all that sold gunpowder, either in gross or retail ; those who kept a large quantity should bc forthwith required to remove it into places near the fields, where it might be free from the danger of fire. 21st April, 1583. I. 538. Letter from the Lord Mayor to Sir Francis Walsingham, Knight. For the stay of the plague, the Court of Aldermen had published certain orders, which they intended to execute with diligence. Among other great inconveniences were the assemblies of people to plays, bear-baiting,1 fencers, and profane spectacles at the Theatre and Curtain and other like places, to which great multitudes of the worst sort of people resorted. Being beyond the jurisdiction of the City, the restraints in the City were useless, unless like orders were carried out in the places adjoining. He therefore requested the matter might be brought to the notice of the Council, that some steps might be taken to redress the danger. 3rd May, 1583. II. 234.

Order of the Star Chamber, reciting that, upon a paper dclivered to the Board from the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, containing some overtures for the preservation of the City from the infection of the plague, it had been ordered that Lord Zouch, Mr. Secretary Lake, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,! calling such Aldermen before them as they should think proper, should consider and report to the Board what steps should be taken for the safety of the City, without inconvenience to trade. 10th October, 16 17.

They understood the plague was daily increasing in the City, but they could not hear that any good course had been taken for preventing it by carrying infected persons to the pest-house, or setting watch upon them, or burning the stuff of the deceased. They therefore required them, in His Majesty's name, to take the strictest course usual in such cases. Whitehall, 25th March, 1625. VI. 62.

On account of the great infection and other extraordinary occasions for his service, not only was His Majesty absent from the City, but the Council were forced to disperse them selves more than at any other time was usual.

Windsor, 20th July, 1625. VI. 63. Letter of the Lord Mayor, in reply. He had used all possible diligence for preventing the spread of the infection ; and the Council might perceive by the Bills (of Mortality),! that within the walls of the City and the liberties it had not hitherto raged so much as in the skirts of the City, where the parishes spread into other Counties, and the multitude of inmates was without measure. Of this he prayed the Council to take especial notice, that, either by Act of Parliament or Order in Council, the same might be reformed. For himself, as he had not hitherto been wanting in the personal execution of his duty, without respect of the danger, so he should (by God's assistance) persevere in such manner as to be able to render a good account of his diligence in the duties of his office. (Circa 1625.) VI. 64. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, referring them to orders issued in the County of Essex, and about to be issued in other Counties. However reasonable the restraint of carriers and men dealing with wares might appear, yet to forbid the resort of higglers, and consequently of all others serving the City with victuals, was a matter worthy of their consideration ; for if the City should be by public authority restrained of victuals, it was to be feared it would not be in the power of himself, or the few Magistrates who remained, to restrain the violence hunger might enforce. (Circa 1625.) VI. 191. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor, stating that they were informed there was much contagious and pestilent sickness in Holland, especially in Amsterdam, and also in France, particularly in Rochelle and the port towns in Bretaigne. It had already been brought by a merchant ship into the Isle of Scilly, and several of the garrison had died in consequence, whilst others were infected. They had received the King's commands to sen,d speedy directions to all the port towns to use all possible care to prevent so great an approaching mischief. They therefore required him not to suffer any persons or goods to be landed in the Port of London until it had been ascertained that the places from which they 1 The total number who died from the plague in the year 1625, as given in the Bills of Mortality for London within and without the walls, was 35,403 ; throughout the country, 68,596.

They had been informed there were divers houses infected with the plague in the parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, Shoreditch, and Whitechapel, and other places near the City ; and required all infected houses to bc shut up, and watchmen set at the doors as usual. Care should be taken that persons infected or shut up, and those attending them, should be relieved out of the parishes by contribution. For their better direc tion, a book, heretofore printed and published, containing instructions given by the Board, which should be carefully observed, was to be reprinted. Whitehall, 12th March, 1629. VII. 18. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen. Upon further deliberation, they thought it better that all infected houses should be voided and shut up, and the inmates sent to the pest-house. As the multitude of poor Irish, and other vagabond persons with which all parts about the City were pestered, must necessarily cause great danger of spreading the contagion, present order should be taken according to law, for freeing the City and liberties from such persons. They should likewise see the streets kept sweet and clean, and the ditches in the suburbs within the liberties thoroughly cleansed, and command the Commissioners of Sewers and the Scavengers, respectively, to perform their duty. The Council were also informed that the number of inmates and ale-houses was excessive. They, therefore, required that the laws for remedy thereof should be strictly put in execution. His Majesty was pleased that the College of Physicians should meet and confer upon some fit course for preventing the infection. Whitehall, iSth March, 1629.

At the end of forty days, if the surgeons reported the vessel free from contagion (all the apparel, goods, household stuff, bedding, &c, having been aired in the mean time on shore), it should be allowed to make free commerce. In conclusion, they recommended, as a cheap and easy course, that one of the King's ships should be anchored low down the river and stop every vessel ; if they found, by their papers, that they came from any of the infected ports, they should be sent back to sea. His Majesty should also issue a manifesto to his allies informing them that no ships or vessels would be allowed to enter the Port of London, unless they brought with them a certificate from the port authorities whence they came.

He had taken measures to investigate the same, but understanding that his lordship, with other members of the Privy Council, had taken the matter in hand, he had stayed further proceedings. He thought it his duty to inform him that the players of plays, used at the Theatre and other such places, and tumblers and such like, were a very superfluous sort of men, and of such faculty as the laws had disallowed ; that the exercise of the plays was not only a great hindrance to the service of God, but also a great corruption of youth, with unchaste and wicked matters, the occasion of much incontinence, practices of many frays, quarrels, and other disorders, within the City. He therefore begged that order might be taken to prevent such plays, not only within the City, but also in the liberties. 1 2th April, 1580. I. 295. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor, Mr. Serjeant Fleetwood, Recorder, and the Aldermen, stating that, for avoiding the increase of infection within the City last summer, orders were sent to them for restraining of plays until Michaelmas last. As the sickness had almost ceased, and was not likely to increase at this time of the year, in order to relieve the poor players, and to encourage their being in readiness with convenient matters for Her Highness's solace this next Christmas, they required them forthwith to suffer the players to practice such plays, in such sort, and in the usual places, as they had been accustomed, having careful regard for the continuance of such quiet order as had been before observed. 1 Sth November, 1581, I. 317. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor. For sundry good causes and considerations they had oftentimes given order for the restraint of plays in and about the City ; nevertheless of late, for honest recreation sake, in respect that Her Majesty sometimes took delight in those pastimes, it had been thought not unfit, having regard to the season of the year and the clearance of the City from infection, to allow of certain companies of players in London, partly that they might thereby attain more dexterity and perfection in that profession, the better to content Her Majesty, the said players being restrained from playing 011 the Sabbath, and only permitted on the ordinary holidays after evening"], [381, "PLAYS AND PLAYERS. 351 prayer, as long as the season of the year would permit, without danger of the infection. They requested the City to appoint some proper person to consider and allow such plays only as were fitted to yield honest recreation and no example of evil. For this purpose the Lord Mayor should withdraw his late prohibition against their playing on holidays, only forbearing the Sabbath-day. If the exercise of the same should increase the sickness and infection, then he should communicate to the Council, nth April, 15S2. I. 319. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, acknowledging the foregoing letter. Although the players began not their plays till after evening service, yet all the afternoon they took in hearers, and filled the place with such as were thereby absent from Church, and attended to serve God's enemies in an inn. If they were restrained from letting in the people till after service it would delay the action of their plays to a very incon venient time of night, specially for servants and children. Further, the plague had increased, and the season being hot and perilous, and term time and the meeting of Parliament near, the renewing and continuance of their exercises would be most dangerous. He there fore requested the Council to continue their restraint of such plays. As touching the orders prescribed for the matter and manner of their plays, steps should be taken to appoint some grave and discreet persons to peruse them and obey the caution of the Council. 1 2th April, 1582, I. 359.

With regard to the letter of the Council on behalf of Her Majesty's players, which the Lord Mayor had interpreted to extend only to holidays and not to other week-days, the Council, considering that without frequent exercise of such plays as were to be presented before Her Majesty her servants could not conveniently satisfy her recreation and their own duty, desired that they should be licensed to perform upon week-days and work-days, at convenient times, between this and Shrovetide (Sundays only excepted). ist December, 1583.

The apprentices and servants were withdrawn from their\" work, to the great hindrance of the trades and traders of the City, and the propagation of religion. Besides, to these places resorted the light and lewd disposed persons, as harlots, cutpurses, cozeners, pilferers, &c, who, under colour of hearing plays, devised divers evil and ungodly matches, confederacies, and conspiracies, which could not be prevented. They besought his favour for reforming the same. Further, because Her Majesty must be served at certain times by this sort of people, she had granted her Letters Patent to Mr. Tilney, her Master of the Revels, by virtue whereof he had authority to reform, exercise, or suppress all manner of players, plays, and playhouses, and he had licensed the said houses which before had been open to the Statutes for the punishing of such disorders. They requested his grace to call the Master of the Revels before him and treat with him as to the measures to be devised, that Her Majesty might be served with these recreations as she had been accustomed, which might easily be done by the private exercise of Her Majesty's own players in convenient places, and the City freed from these continual disorders. 25th February, 1592.

The Theatre in Shoreditch was built by James Burbage, one of the leading members of the Earl of Leicester's company of players, who obtained a lease of the property on the 13th of April, 1576. He began the building imme- diately afterwards. It is mentioned in a letter from the Lords of the Council to Lord Wentworth, Master ofthe Rolls, and to the Lieutenant of the Tower, on the ist of August, 1577- This was the earliest dramatic building erected in this country. The locality is shown in the maps of London by Agas, circa 1560, and Braun, in 1574. Fencing matches were also held here. The Curtain was situated on the southern side of Holywell Lane, and took its name from the piece of ground upon which it was built, which is called in a lease ofthe land granted by the Holywell Priory, 1538, \"the Curten.\" It is mentioned again in a lease of 1581, \" all thatt house, tenemente or lodge, commonly called the Curtayne.\" The earliest mention ofthe Curtain Playhouse is in December, 1577.

The owner of the said playhouse, under the name of a private house, converted it to a public playhouse, to which there was daily such a resort of people and such a multitude of coaches (many of them hackney coaches bringing people of all sorts), that at ti,mes the streets could not contain them, they clogged up Ludgate Hill also, so that they endangered one another, broke down stalls, threw down goods, and the inhabitants were unable to get to their houses, or bring in their provisions, the tradesmen to utter their wares, or passengers to get to the common water stairs without danger of life and limb ; quarrels and effusion of blood had followed, and other dangers might be occasioned by the broils, plots, and practices of such an unruly multitude. These inconveniences happening almost daily in the winter time (not excepting Lent) from one or two o'clock till five at night (the usual time for christenings, burials, and afternoon service), the inhabitants were unable to get to the church, the ordinary passage for a great part of the precinct being close by the playhouse door. The petitioners therefore prayed that order might be taken in the matter, and the owner of the playhouse required to satisfy the Court of Aldermen for his presumption in breaking the aforesaid Orders, and to put in sufficient surety for the time to come. If the in habitants, by turnpikes, posts, chains, or otherwise, kept the coaches outside their gates, great inconvenience would ensue to Ludgate and the streets thereabout, they therefore craved aid and direction from the Court in all the premises.

Thirdly. Finding the gaol pestered with prisoners, and their bane to take root and beginning at ale-houses, and much mischief to bc there plotted, with great waste of corn in brewing heady strong beer, \" many consuming all their time and means sucking that sweet poison,\" he had taken an exact survey of all victualling houses and ale-houses, which were above a thousand, and above 300 barrels of strong beer in some houses, the whole quantity of beer in victualling houses amounting to above 40,000 barrels ; he had thought it high time to abridge their number and limit them by bonds as to the quantity of beer they should use, and as to what orders they should observe, whereby the price of corn and malt had greatly fallen. Fourthly. The Bakers and Brewers had been drawn within bounds, so that, if the course continued, men might have what they paid for, viz., weight and measure. He had also endeavoured to keep the Sabbath day holy, for which he had been much maligned. Fifthly.

It remained for the Court of Aldermen to see the same carefully per formed within the City.

Such of the Council as the King should be pleased to leave behind for that purpose would be ready to assist whenever required for preservation of the peace.

Though they were very unwilling to hearken to such request, yet since they had to answer a great rent to the King for their office, they did not doubt that it would seem to the Lord Mayor reasonable that those who were benefited by such a course should contribute to theiryearly charge. Since they were given to understand it could not be done but by the Lord Mayor's decree with common consent, they had thought it right to bring the subject to the consideration of the Court of Aldermen, and trusted it would be speedily determined, because, though hourly applied to for licences, they had, out of respect to his Lordship and the City, forborne to issue any until they should have received the City's answer.

Latterly they had usually acquainted the Lord Bishop of London with their names, that he, knowing who they were, might the more fitly appoint a preacher for the rehearsal sermon at Paul's Cross. They had lately appointed three learned preachers as usual, two of them being Doctors of Divinity, and had caused the Chamberlain to acquaint the Bishop with their names. He asserted the right to appoint such preachers belonged to himself (though neither he nor his predecessors had ever chosen them), and had forbidden one of them by name, and said he would forbid the rest to preach there. Such a course would be displeasing to the citizens, and hinder their wonted charity to the poor. And the Masters and Governors of the several Hospitals of the City would be discouraged, both in their daily care and pains, and in the observation of that decent order used at those times when they and all the children and poor people of each Hospital resorted to those sermons, where they had built a place to sit and show themselves, in remem brance of their good benefactors and of the comforts they received, and thus to stir up imitation in others. The Court, therefore, desired that their preachers might receive directions to preach without in terruption as heretofore, for they considered that though the Bishop might censure both the lives and doctrines of preachers in his diocese, he should not assume a nomination to himself which by ancient custom belonged to others.

The petitioners always kept as great an assize as was generally kept throughout the kingdom. Their gains in their trade at the present time were very small, on account of their small return and of the low price of wheat, the greatest part of the common people now making their own provisions. As they had formerly shown the Court, the assize of seventeen ounces was not set after the second price of wheat in the market as required by law, and they were unable to take a quarter of wheat with bare 6s. allowance, as by a computation of a baker's weekly charges in the annexed note would appear. And upon their former humble petition for a better allowance the Court had directed they should have Ss. per quarter.

Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council, in reply. They had considered what the Council had urged as to the Monday markets at Barnet, and had had the butchers before them, who prayed leave to satisfy the Council that they were free from any practice for making victuals dear. Coals were at reasonable rates, the wharves were well furnished, and there was greater store of coals for the poor than in former years. 1,500 quarters of corn were in store, and orders had been given to the Companies for the speedy provision of another 1,000 quarters.

Order of the Council, reciting that a Petition had been presented to them bythe Eastland Merchants' Company, complaining that, in contempt of an Order of the Court of Aldermen, made pursuant to directions from the Council, the Companies of London refused to take their rye, though the Petitioners had offered to abate 6d. per bushel of the price fixed by the said Order ; that the Masters and Wardens of some of the Companies had been heard that day before the Board, and had alleged that they had sufficient in store till harvest, and that the price of 6s. 6d. per bushel demanded by the Eastland Company was higher than the market rate. The Council therefore direct the Court of Aldermen to certify the"], [419, "PROVISIONS (corn, etc.). 389 quantities and sorts of corn then in store in the granaries of the several Companies, together with a Schedule of the proportions and sorts of grain each Company ought to have in store.

Reply of the Lord Mayor to the foregoing, certifying that the number of men, women, and children in the several wards within the City and Liberties was estimated at 130,280, for whom he thought eight ounces of bread each per day would be sufficient. 5,000 quarters of wheat per month would therefore be sufficient to serve the City. Dated in margin, 6th December, 163 1. VII. 75. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor (and Court of Aldermen), complaining of their neglect in requiring the Companies to provide their proper proportions of corn, and that no steps had been taken for the punishment of delinquents,. but rather there appeared a readiness to excuse and palliate their offences. The Council required that the defaulters should be punished in some exemplary manner according to their demerits, and that a certificate of the steps taken should be forwarded to the Board by the last of the next month. Whitehall, last of October, 163 VII. 79. Certificate from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council, that much care had been taken to require the Companies to make up their several proportions of 10,000 quarters of corn ; but that there had been negligence in the execution of the precepts. They had committed to Newgate divers of the wardens of the Companies, and intended to proceed to the punishment of others who had made default. As to the Council's letters with respect to the assize of bread, they had already caused their commands to be published, and had given strict order for their exact performance.

Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Bishop of London (Aylmer), in reply to his request for permission for his butcher to kill flesh. The Lords of the Council had permitted the Lord Mayor to license certain persons to kill flesh for the sick ; the number so licensed were bound to give weekly an account in writing of every joint they uttered, which bond his butcher refused. In order that his Lordship might not want, order had been taken to supply him by such as had given bond. 25th February, 1579. I. 1 86. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer. As Lent was approaching, he had gathered together such Orders as had been given from time tg time for the abstinence from flesh, and requested his advice as to the issue and observation of the same, or others. 23rd January, 1580. I. 300. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor. They had been informed that flesh was commonly eaten in Lent in sundry tabling houses, and that forty butchers were suffered to kill and sell flesh within the liberties of the City to all comers. The Fishmongers complained that they could not sell their wares, whereby the navigation and trade of Mariners would be discouraged and fall into decay. They desired to be informed of the truth of this state ment ; of the number of butchers licensed to kill flesh, and what steps had been taken by the Aldermen for restraining of the tabling and other houses. 9th March, 1581. was from time to time continued, licences to eat flesh were granted by the sovereign, or the archbishops, on payment by the licensees of certain lines into the poor-box of their parish, viz., by .. ti.

(Vide Clause 13.) Proclamations on the subject were issued annually. There is a copy of one published in 1618 in the Guildhall Museum."], [423, "PROVISIONS (FLESH, FISH, ETC.). 393 I. 301. Reply of the Lord Mayor. The number of butchers had been restrained to five, four for the whole City, namely, two in either shambles and one for the borough of Southwark, and these had been bound not to utter flesh to any but such as were, by sickness or otherwise, lawfully licensed to eat flesh. As touching table-keepers, cooks, innholdcrs, and other victuallers, a great mul titude had been already dealt with according to former usage and the rest would be proceeded against at once, and restrained from infringing Her Majesty's proclamation. nth March, 1581. I. 332. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Chancellor. It had been the custom, in order to carry out the Queen's pro clamation for the observation of abstinence from flesh in Lent and other forbidden times, for the Aldermen of the City to make certificate of the number of offenders in their wards to the Court of Chancery at the beginning of Easter Term, which certificates had been received by the Officers in Chancery without fee or charge. The Officers now demanded a fee of 2s. for every presentment which would amount in the whole to 5/. He begged that directions might bc given to the Officers to receive the presentments without charge. 5th May, 1582. I. 463. Letter from William Lord Burghley to the Lord Mayor, acknowledging his Letter requesting instructions touching the ab staining from flesh in Lent, and recommending that the former Orders of the Council should be observed. As to licensing butchers to kill flesh, he thought it quite unnecessary, infirm persons being allowed poultry. In a large liberty where he had jurisdiction, he did not permit any butchers' wares to be killed. 26th January, 1582. I. 468. Letter from Charles Lord Howard of Effingham, requesting that a licence to kill flesh in Lent might be granted to David Ncwholt, of Little Eastcheap. 24th January, 1582. I. 469. Letter from the Lord Mayor in reply, regretting that he had not the power, except by warrant from the Council, under which three butchers had been already appointed. The Lord Treasurer had refused to license any in Westminster. ist February, 1582. I. 470. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer, requesting his instructions as to the number of butchers to be"], [424, "PROVISIONS (flesh, fish, etc.). 394 licensed to kill flesh in Lent. At present he had only appointed two for the one shambles and one for the other, and none for Southwark. 25th January, 1582. I. 574. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor, complaining of the non-observanec^of the Orders issued by the Council for the killing of flesh in Lent, and directing steps to be at once taken to carry the same into execution, and the names of those to whom licences had been already granted to bc forwarded to them. 30th January, 1586. I. 580. Letter from the Lord Mayor to Sir Francis Walsing ham. Great disorders had been yearly committed by the butchers of the City, who, being of a rude and uncivil kind, could hardly bc kept from killing flesh in Lent. A number of honourable persons usually made request to have certain persons licensed, who were dissatisfied upon refusal. He had therefore thought it better that the Council should take the power of granting licences into their own hands, and for their information he enclosed a list of those who had been recommended to be licensed. 24th January, 1587. I. 588. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer. He had been charged before the Council by Mr. Ashley, one of the Clerks of the Council, with some indirect dealing in the admittance of the butchers to bc licensed to kill flesh this Lent, and had sent a reply, which, by some mischance had not been laid before their Lordships. He enclosed a copy, with a request that it might be read at their next, meeting. 9th March, 1590. I. 606. Letter from the Lord Mayer to the Lords of the Council. Upon receipt of their charge concerning the killing and eating of flesh, he had taken every precaution to restrain the same, and had taken bonds of all victuallers, innholders, and other such like traders within the City's jurisdiction. The principal cause of the disorders committed was the great number of butchers licensed to kill flesh within the privileged places, and the licentious behaviour of such victuallers and fablers as dwelt within the said liberties and exempt places, who set open their houses and kept common tables for all sorts of people. He requested that some further order might be taken for their restraint or moderation. 12th March, 1590. I. 613. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer. He had been already importuned about the licensing of butchers in the"], [425, "PROVISIONS (flesh, fish, etc.). 395 coming Lent. There being only six to bc selected, he anticipated much dissatisfaction would be felt by the persons recommending their butchers ; the late Lord Mayor had been reviled and threatened by certain officers of the Court and others of high place, for not being able to comply with their requests. 12th December, 1591. I. 614. Letter from the Lord Mayor to Sir Robert Cecil. In accordance with his Letter he had licensed Nicolas Simons to kill flesh next Lent. As there were only six to be appointed, he requested him to intercede with those who would be disappointed by not having similar requests gratified. 13th December, 1591. I. 625. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Chamberlain, acknowledging his Letter, recommending Richard Wise, butcher, of St. Nicholas shambles, for a licence to kill flesh in Lent. The number (limited by the Council to six) had been already appointed, but he would license Wise if his lordship would stand between him and any displeasure which might arise at the Council. As the Lord Treasurer had directed that every butcher so licensed should pay a certain sum of money towards the relief of maimed soldiers, he requested that Wise should be directed to repair to him and pay the fine before being licensed. nth January, 1591. I. 630. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, acknowledging the receipt of their Orders for the restraint of killing and eating flesh during Lent, in which provision had been made that certain persons should watch at the gates of the City and other like places in the suburbs, to intercept all flesh brought in for the supply of persons not licensed to eat the same, the flesh to bc sold to the use of the hospitals and prisons within the Cit)-. The watchmen hired to perform this duty had not carried it out strictly, and the Lord Mayor recommended the Council, for the encouragement of the men in diligence, to allow them half the flesh so taken instead of wages, the other half to bc used for the establishments before named. Sth February, 1591. I. 642. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer. He had received a Letter from Mr. Awbrey, Master of the Court of Requests, signifying the Queen's pleasure for granting a licence to kill flesh in Lent to John Scrogge, butcher, at the suit of one Froe Gilham, an attendant upon Her Majesty. The number of butchers to be appointed being already full, and the liberty and disorder of killing flesh in exempt places and suburbs being very great, he had"], [426, "provisions (flesh, fish, etc.). 396 suggested that a portion of the money gathered from the butchers should be given to the said Froe Gilham instead of increasing the number of licensed butchers. 29th January, 1 591. 29th January, 1591. I. 653. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Chamberlain. It had always been the privilege of the Lord Mayor to appoint and license the several butchers within the City to kill flesh in Lent. During the mayoralty of Sir John Abbott, his predecessor, the Lords of the Council had bestowed the privilege upon the Clerks of the Council, to the prejudice and injury of the City. It was therefore not in his power to appoint the person named by his Lordship. 17th March, 1591. II. 93. Letter from' the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, touching the scarcity of fresh and salt fish, and the intercepting by pirates of fishing boats coming to the City, and suggesting the repeal ofthe statute made in the 23rd of Elizabeth.1 3rd April, 1595. II. 116. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, enclosing petition from the Company that traded for butter and cheese within the City, complaining that restraint had been made by the Justices of the Peace within the counties of Suffolk, Norfolk, and Essex, whereby they were inhibited from bringing from thence such provisions, to the great distress of the poor housekeepers of the City, and requesting their Lordships to direct their warrant to the Justices and officers of the ports within those shires to remove the restraint. 29th October, 1595. II. 129.

Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord High Admiral, in answer to his communication soliciting a butcher's place during this Lent for his servant, and informing him of the Orders received from the Council thereon. 20th January, 1602. II. 244. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council. According to their commands, he had taken bond from the Poulterers of the City, prohibiting them from selling pheasants, partridges, and rabbits before the 6th of June. The Poulterers of Westminster and the suburbs sold the same at all times, to the injury of the Citizens. He prayed that they might be restrained. 20th May, 1604. II. 2S1. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Board of Green Cloth, as to the conduct of the buyers of bacon for the supply of His Majesty's household from the markets. 15th February, 1606. III. 3. Letter from the Lords ofthe Council to the Lord Mayor, referring to the Laws made and Orders published every year for the due observation of Lent, \" because it is the time of increase which supplieth the rest of the year with provision of victuals.\" They had from time to time written to his predecessors to see such Orders and Directions duly observed, and to restrain the excessive killing and eating of flesh, yet the)' found the Orders every year neglected and less observed. They requested him to confer with the Justices of"], [428, "PROVISIONS (l-'LESII, FISH, ETC.). 398 the Peace for Middlesex and Surrey, and consider how the same might be suppressed, and to attend with the Recorder and some of the Aldermen at the Council on the next Sunday. 14th January, 16 10. III. 4. Further Letter from the Lords ofthe Council to the Lord Mayor, reminding him of the former Orders, and of the following additions which they thought meet to be effectually observed, viz. : That the printed Orders should be more duly kept, for the better performance whereof he should not suffer any butchers that were to be allowed within the City to take partners, whereby they might kill a greater proportion, and should cause an oath to be administered to each of them, according to a form conceived and presented to the Council by the Recorder. Whereas the butchers had been accustomed to provide and kill against Shrovetide an excessive proportion of all manner of flesh, more than could be uttered in any reasonable time, he should take order that if any butcher, not licensed, should be found with any flesh after Shrove Tuesday at night, such flesh should be disposed and given to the prisons and other poor, as might be thought meet. Further, whereas keepers of taverns, inns, and ordinaries in time of Lent dressed and uttered flesh in their houses, he should direct that such places should bc often visited and searched, and the offenders proceeded against without favour or connivance. 28th January, 1610. A Postscript directs that the Lord Mayor should take the same course with the Poulterers as with the Butchers. III. 37. Letter from the Lords ofthe Council to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, with respect to the restraint of killing and eating of flesh in Lent, and exhorting them to carry a strict hand over taverns, ordinaries, and tippling-houses, on account of the late high prices of victuals, without any known or apparent cause. 19th February, 161 1. III. 3S. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, with reference to their determination not to permit licences to bc granted as heretofore to butchers to kill and utter flesh durin\"- Lent, and setting out several reasons against the same, such as the scarcity and dearness of fish, butter, cheese, bacon, and eggs, the prevalence of ague, &c. Did not the necessity of the time, both in policy and discretion, move him, he should pray their Lordships that all licences might be forborne, there being nothing that brought to the Cit)' more displeasure from great persons, whom they refused to"], [429, "PROVISIONS (FLESH, FISH, ETC.). 399 gratify, or more blame from the Council, than the licensing of butchers to sell flesh in Lent. 14th February, 161 1. A note in the margin states in effect that, upon consideration of this Letter, the Lords allowed the Lord Mayor to license eight butchers. III. 72. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor. So great had been the abuse and contempt of the former Orders for the keeping of Lent, that His Majesty had been enforced to prohibit absolutely the killing of flesh by any butcher or other person in the City, or any other part of the kingdom, during this Lent, and had therefore caused certain new Orders to be printed and published for that purpose. 9th February, 161 2. III. 73. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords ofthe Council with reference to the foregoing, requesting them to prescribe with cer tainty the manner in which he should carry out the Orders for keeping Lent, otherwise he should fear that he was left to the strict per formance of His Majesty's directions. 10th February, 161 2. III. 78. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, suggesting sundry reasons, such as. the scarcity and dearness of fish, butter, cheese, and bacon, the prevalence of ague and other infirmities, for the allowance of some flesh to be killed and uttered during Lent, 1 Sth February, 161 2. III. 82. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor. It was not intended that all poulterers should bc restrained from killing and uttering their wares, but that, for the comfort of the infirm and sickly, he might freely license as man)' poulterers within the City and Liberties as he deemed meet and convenient. 25th February, 1612. III. 91. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council. They were informed the Council had given warrant to certain messengers to search within the City for such butchers as killed and sold flesh during Lent, and to bring the offenders before them to answer the contempt. They hoped the Council would not grant any warrants to messengers to search within the City, but would address their letters and warrants to the Lord Mayor. It was a matter which much concerned their charter and the ancient customs and franchises of the City, for any foreign officer to execute, in person, any warrant in the City without the assistance and direction of the Lord Mayor. The messengers having attached the bod)' of a"], [430, "PROVISIONS (FLESH, FISH, ETC.). 400 butcher dwelling within the shambles, without acquainting the Lord Mayor or requiring his aid or direction, the Court of Aldermen had committed the butcher to prison, till the pleasure of the Council should be further signified. 1 1 th March, 1 6 1 2. III. 134. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor, authorizing him, for the service of the Ambassadors here resident, and sick persons, to license one butcher to kill and utter flesh in Lent, and to give notice at the Ambassadors' houses of the name and address of such butcher. 12th March, 161 3. III. 144. Letter from the Lords of the Council to Sir Edward Coke, Knight, Chief Justice of England, Sir Henry Hubbart,1 Knight and Baronet, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Sir Lawrence Tanfield, Knight, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, informing them that the Council, having authorized the Lord Mayor to appoint a butcher to kill flesh during Lent for the service of Foreign Ambassadors, he had, for the relief of three poor men, allowed them to join in partnership to make provision of flesh in a private place within Guildhall, for the use of the said Ambassadors. These butchers had since been served with process to appear to some information for uttering flesh in Lent. The Council required that orders should bc given for stay thereof, and that they should be no further troubled. Whitehall, 13th May, 1614. IV. 13. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council. Their lordships having for the last three years thought fit to restrain the licensing of butchers during Lent, the Court of Aldermen had con sidered the inconveniences and contrary effects produced thereby. The butchers without number sold flesh, and all manner of people, weak and sound of body, bought it, as commonly as in open time, which would not be the case if some few butchers were licensed, and forbidden to sell to other than those licensed to buy. A special eye should also be had to the great excesses and abuses committed in taverns, tabling houses, victualling houses, and inns, and also to the abuse of Friday night suppers. The Fishmongers made an extraordinary use of the time in the price of all manner of fish. Eggs were six and seven a groat, butter 8d. per pound, and cheese and bacon excessively dear.

They were constrained to trouble him, touching a most unequal assessment, imposed upon them by the Court of Aldermen towards the contribution money to the Palatinate. After a collection had been made in all the parishes of London towards the contribu tion, the total not rising to the proportion required, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen had ordered that 5,000/. should be collected from the Companies of London, each Company paying rateably according to their usual rates for other assessments, which the Com panies had accordingly paid. The petitioners had offered to pay according to their rate 25/., as much as they ever paid when they were with the Grocers, which the Court of Aldermen had refused to accept, and had ordered that no apprentice of the Company should be made free of the City until the Company had paid 200/. towards the contribution, which was as much as any Company under the twelve had paid, one only excepted. Most of the Companies had not paid a fourth part, many not a sixth part, some not a tenth part, and some not a twentieth part of the assessment made upon the Apothecaries, which inequalities they left to His Majesty's considera tion, and prayed him to write to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and require them not to exact from them any other pro portion to this or any other charge than they paid when they were with the Grocers, the same rates being now paid by them severaliy as were formerly paid by the two Companies jointly ; otherwise they feared that the Grocers would procure them on all occasions to bc so overcharged that they could not long subsist, which was the principal scope the Grocers had in view.

Upon the levy of moneys towards the recovery of the Palatinate, they had followed the usual course of rating the Companies of London ; and although they found the Apothecaries lately divided into a Company from the Grocers1 they rated them as formerly, altogether at 500/., of which the Grocers paid 300/. and allotted the residue for payment by the Apothecaries, upon whose refusal the Court had called both Companies before them and heard them thereon. The Grocers readily assented to submit to such order as the Court might think fit, but the Apothe caries refused, holding the sum of 200/. to be too great a proportion for them ; and the money was still unpaid. The Court having gone as far in the business as they lawfully could, and the Apothecaries as they then stood being a divided Company, and not so far bound to obedience by oath as they were before their separation from the Grocers, and the Court being unable by their own authority to compel them, they referred the ordering of the matter to his Lordship. 15th May, 1621.

To prevent the Posts from carrying the letters qf any merchants willing to employ them, he had caused their bills at London and Plymouth to be pulled down. The Council, find ing that Jude's proceedings were contrary to any of their former orders made in his favour, which were not intended to permit him to main tain and keep horses and servants at several stages on the road for the carriage of passengers and the dispatch of business in the nature of a Post, much less to give him power to take up horses by Warrant 1 A \" Thorough Post\" was established between the North and London in 1603.

Early in Queen Elizabeth's reign it was renewed ; the points in controversy are referred to in the above letter. The Council referred the ques tion to the consideration of the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench (Sir Christopher Wray), the Lord Chief Justice ofthe Common Pleas (Sir Edward Anderson), and the Master ofthe Rolls (Sir Gilbert Gerard}, who gave their opinion upon some of the privileges claimed by the Lieutenant, but not upon the question of boundaries. They reported with respect to the claims of freedom from arrest by action in the City, and protections granted by the Lieutenant to officers and attendants in the Tower, and not obeying writs of habeas corpus ; that, in their opinion, persons daily attendant in the Tower, and serving the Queen there,"], [457, "RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. 427 whereby the victuallers were discouraged to come to the City, and their number much decreased, to the great hurt of the markets and the should be privileged and not arrested on any plaint in London, but that this should not apply to writs of execution or capias utlagatum ; that the Lieutenant ought to return every habeas corpus out of any court at Westminster, so that the justices before whom it should be returned might either remand it with the body, or retain tlie matter before them and deliver the body. They further gave their opinion that the claim of the Lieutenant, that if a person privileged in the Tower were arrested in London, he might detain any citizen sound within the Tower until the other was delivered, was altogether against the laws ofthe realm. The Lords of the Council made an order for settling these controversies, which was dated from Nonsuch, October 3rd, 15S5. The question of boundaries still remained in dispute. Stow cpiotes documents, which he says he had seen among the Records in the Tower, from which it would appear that the bounds in controversy were at Little Tower Hill, the Postern, and East Smithfield on one side, and on the other the extent of Tower Hill, and towards Barking Church. The City claimed the Postern Gate in the end of the London Wall by the Tower, and the houses built near to the Wall and Postern ; all the void ground within the Postern Gate, viz., the whole hill and ground where the scaffold for the execution of traitors stood, and where the Sheriffs of London received prisoners from the Tower to be executed (from which place the boundary stone had been removed), with the Watergate and the gardens under the London Wall. The City also claimed that the whole ground and soil called Tower Hill without the Postern Gate, being parcel of East Smithfield, was theirs. They likewise objected to the Lieutenant holding pleas in the .court of the Tower, that being only a Court Baron, and not a Court of Record ; also to the exactions taken in the name of prizage of victuallers bringing victuals, fuel, and other things by water. The Lieutenant disputed the original position of the Postern in question, and asserted that the City's proofs brought from their own manuscripts, &c, were insufficient to dispossess any subject, much less the King. He also submitted the presentment made by an inquest held anno 27 Henry VIII., besore Sir Anthony (William) Kingston, High Constable ofthe Tower, which stated that the bounds began \"at the Watergate, next the Ramshead, in Petty Wales ; and so stretched North unto aMudwall called Pykes Garden, on this side of Crutched Friars ; and so strait East unto the Wall of London, with nine gardens above the Postern, and above the Broken Tomer, right unto the midst of Hog Lane End, and so strait unto the Thames, and so six Foot without the Stairs at the Eastgate of the Tower towards St. Katharines.\" In the reign of King James the Second the subject was again before the Privy Council, who, on the 12th May, 1686, directed the boundaries to be ascertained, which was done, and the broad arrow in iron, with the date, set on the houses. On the 13th October in the same year a warrant was issued by King James the Second, for a charter to be prepared for con firming the same. This Charter, dated 10th June, 1687, exempted the limits defined in the schedule (and which were practically those claimed by the Lieutenant) from the jurisdiction of the City, and of the Justices, &c, of Middlesex ; directed that the Governor of the Tower, or his deputies, should execute and return all writs, processes, &c, within the limits ; that a Session of the Peace should be held four times a year within the Liberty of the Tower, and that the Justices of the Peace should have power to commit traitors, felons, &c, to New gate. It also established a Court of Record within the Liberties, the Steward of the Court being the Coroner, the Governor of the Tower having the appointment of the officers. Whilst the duties of the Justices of the Peace, as defined by the charter, have been from time to time added to by the Acts 13 George II. cap. 19, sec. 7, 37 George HI. cap. 25, sec. 13-16, and by sundry Licensing Acts, their powers have been limited by the Police Act (10 George IV. cap. 44) and supplementary Police Acts. The Central Criminal Court Act, 4 & 5 William IV. cap. included the Liberty of the Tower within the jurisdiction of that Court, and took away the power of its Justices to try at their Sessions offences under the Act. This, however, has since been somewhat modified by subsequent Acts.

The Lord Mayor prayed that some expedition might be taken in the suit, and that in the mean time Sir William George should bc commanded to forbear. Sth March, 1579. I. 94.

Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer, com plaining of the imprisonment of five or six Citizens of good account, one being the Alderman's deputy, by the Lieutenant of the Tower, and begging him to command the Lieutenant to deliver them up and to imprison no more until the cause should have been heard. Either the Queen's process and common justice should be executed by the Sheriffs and officers ofthe City, or they should be discharged of amerce ments and actions for not obeying the same. 21st July, 1582. I. 379. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council. The variance between the City and the Gentleman Porter of the Tower touching the interest of the postern of this City, and of the soil of East Smithfield and the Tower Hill, had been by their Lordships referred to the hearing of the Master of the Rolls, then Her Majesty's Attorney, and the Lord Chancellor, then Her Solicitor, to be by them reported to the Council, with charge given in the mean season to make no new innovations, which order the City had obediently observed. One Heming, by appointment of the Gentleman Porter, had lately set up upon the soil, in variance, on the one side of the City's wall, sundry new tenements, and, on the other side, laid founda tions for more, not only against their Lordships' said order, but also against Her Majesty's Proclamation touching new buildings, and to the City's apparent prejudice, the title for the- soil being fully proved to be the City's. The Lord Mayor therefore requested their Lordships to give orders against such innovations while the cause was depending, and that report might be speedily made touching the title, or that the right might be tried according to law. To the great disturbance of this City, the hindrance of justice, and the peril of the Sheriffs when Her Majesty's writs, both for execution and other, were awarded out of the High Court of Queen's Bench and other Courts, divers persons, not meaning to pay their debts, had obtained the pretended privilege of the Tower, and if the Sheriffs attached them good citizens were taken prisoners into the Tower and there violently detained against all colour of law. Of late one John Walton, a Blacksmith of London, and Clerk or Beadle of that Company, being indebted, procured him self to be privileged in the Tower, not being a Warder or other 1 So called from two Anglo-Saxon words, signifying \"seizure per contra,\" reprisal by writ upon other cattle or goods than those which by the defendant have been unlawfully taken.

The Queen's process came out of her Bench to arrest him, whereby he had been taken and remained in ward. If the Sheriffs did not execute the processes they would be subject not only to amercements but also to the complainants' actions, so every way they would be in peril. For this cause an honest citizen, William Shacrost, remained a prisoner in the Tower, and it had been determined to take more. The Lord Mayor therefore begged that either the Lieutenant might be com manded to deliver up the said Shacrost, and to forbear such unjust violence, or that the Sheriffs might not be amerced or subject to actions for refusing to execute the Queen's processes against such privileged persons ; or that, -with Her Majesty's good favour, such pretended privilege might be decided by law. 20th July, 1582. I. 380. Letter from the Lords of the Council to Sir William George, Knight, Gentleman Porter of the Tower. They had com mitted the hearing of the controversy between him and the City to certain of Her Majesty's learned counsel, requiring them, after hearing both parties, to report their opinion thereon, which hitherto had not been done. The Council were astonished that he, or any under him, should make any innovation or intermeddle in a matter not yet resolved, but standing in question and doubt of law, and commanded him and the said Heming forthwith to surcease to erect or build any tenements upon the soil in question, or to do any other action which might tend to prejudice the right, until it should be decided to whom the same appertained. 22nd July, 1582. I. 385. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lieutenant of the Tower. Great complaint had been made to the Council that he had, under colour of his office, protected divers bankrupts, &c, with the pretended privileges of the Tower, and thus prevented their being served with writs and processes by the Sheriffs or their officers ; and also that he had taken other citizens who had not committed any offence and imprisoned them in that place. The Sheriffs should be allowed to execute their office, and he should forthwith set at liberty all such citizens as he had committed without cause. The Council intended shortly to hear the matters in dispute. 22nd July, 1582. I. 408. Letter from the Mayors, Bailiffs and Jurats of the Cinque Ports and two ancient towns to the Lord Mayor, stating that at a meeting held at Hithe, in Kent, within the Liberties of the Five Ports, a complaint had been made by James Oxley, a Freeman of the Town of Rye, one of the ancient towns of the Cinque Ports, against Sir John Branch, late Lord Mayor, for an outrage and injustice done to"], [461, "RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. 431 him by committing him to Newgate for delivering certain letters of process of withernam to the said Sir John Branch. While in New gate they had bolts or irons clapped upon his legs, as though he had been some notorious offender, and he had been detained in prison for a season, to his utter discredit, for which extreme injury and wrong imprisonment he prayed the aid of the members of the Cinque Ports. They desired the Lord Mayor with convenient speed to confer with the late Lord Mayor about the case, and to award some recompense to Oxley for the injury suffered by him. 14th September, 1582. I. 423. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer. Upon the controversy raised by suggestion of Antony White and his deputy, in the Court of Exchequer, the City's ancient right to the office of Garbler within the City and liberties, confirmed by charters and statute, had been decreed by the Court on the City's part well proved, and their title good and substantial ; nevertheless, upon mediation of sundry honourable persons, and in respect of the poverty of White's widow, who had Her Majesty's Letters Patent for that office, both within the City and elsewhere throughout England, the Court of Aldermen had been willing to relieve her with a yearly pension, which she had refused. Afterwards it had been agreed to bargain with her for her whole interest, which had been done, and the sum agreed upon and in part paid. She had since informed the City that his lordship desired her not to complete the same. He therefore prayed his lordship's favourable consideration of the City's interest, and that they might be left to their original bargain. 4th May, 1582. I. 426. Letter from the Lord Mayor to' the Lord Treasurer, requesting that the City's interest in the office of Garbling, depending before his lordship and the Barons of the Exchequer, and which had been partly heard last term, might be postponed until another term. 6th November, 1582.

At the place without the Tower Gate where such oaths used to be taken had been erected cobblers' sheds, for the profit of the Gentleman Porter, in which sheds there had been lately three dead of the plague. When he (the Lord Mayor) attended to take his oath without the Tower Gate he had Her Majesty's sword carried before him in the streets, as had been the custom to carry it in Westminster Hall until they came to the bar of Her Majesty's Court, when the sword was reversed by the sword-bearer as in the presence of Her Majesty ; and so it had been intended to be done when arriving at the place where the Lieutenant sat, as had been the custom. They were met at the corner of Tower Street by two of the Warders, who commanded Her Majesty's sword to be holden down, and pressed violently to take it down, but through the good discretion of the Recorder they were peaceably holden off. The ancient boundary stone, where the Sheriffs of London used to receive of the Lieutenant prisoners for execution, and seal the indentures of receipts, had been removed by order of the Lieutenant, a thing very offensive to the citizens. If it should be his Lordship's pleasure that the Sheriff's admission should be at this place, he requested him to direct the Lieutenant to restore the stone to its ancient position, and to take care that no offence should be committed by his officers. (Circa 1582.) I. 433. Letter from the Lord Mayor to Mr. Serjeant Fleetwood, Recorder, informing him of the death of Mr. Sheriff Heydon and the election of Mr. Cuthbert Buckle to the office.

He had written to that effect to the Lord Chancellor and Lord Treasurer, and forwarded the copy of the letter and a copy of the writ in such case, according to the precedent of Mr. Priest,1 in the time of King Henry the Eighth. He further requested him to pre sent the letter to the Lord Chancellor and Lord Treasurer. 27th November, 1582. I. 434.

The Lord Chancellor advised that the new Sheriff should not be presented at the Tower Gates before Mr. Lieutenant, but at the next term in the Exchequer. They had also waited upon the Lord Treasurer, who had conferred with the Lord Chancellor thereon. They agreed that Mr. Sheriff was a perfect Sheriff, and might do all things appertaining to his office, having once been sworn in the City according to custom, and directed that he should be presented at the Exchequer next term. At this resolution were Sir Walter Mildmay, Master of the Rolls, and the Attorney-General, with Mr. Fanshaw, and others. By direction of the Lord Treasurer he was to remain at Court until after the meet ing of the Star Chamber, to answer a complaint of Mr. Comptroller for speaking in defence of the office of Garbler. Hertford, 28th November, 1582, I. 436. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer. The Court of Aldermen had been informed that Mr. Attorney had moved for the appointment of a Commission between Her Majesty and the City, to inquire into the non-using or abusing of the office of Garbling, since the first year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth. Inasmuch as the title of the City, both by Charter and Parliament, had been shown and fully proved, he con sidered it very unusual to examine into every particular offence of their officers and servants for so long a period, to the prejudice or discredit of the City, who had been the only diligent executors thereof throughout the realm. 28th November, 1582. I. 464. Letter from the Lord Mayor to Sir Francis Walsingham. The variances depending between the City and some of the officers of Her Majesty's Tower had been principally raised and con tinued by one Heming, servant to the Gentleman Porter, some of whose doings Sir William George himself had disavowed. The matters complained of having been deferred by reason of the late sickness, and by the absence of the Council from London, and now being daily multiplied, he desired to renew the complaint, and to pray that a final order might be passed to stay the present wrongs, and to prevent the evils which might ensue, especially as the Lieu tenant was otherwise a gentleman of great worth and a very good friend to the City. He had thought it good to signify the case according to the articles enclosed, to the end that instructions might be given to the Lieutenant to reform the several injuries, and specially for the replacing of the boundary stone, 29th January, 1582. F F"], [464, "434 RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. I. 475, 476. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council. The examination of the variance between the City of London and the officers of the Tower had been by them committed to the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls, then Solicitor and Attorney- General, before whom the right of the City to the soil and jurisdiction of these grounds was fully proved, but no report of the examina tions had been made to the Council. Mr. Heming (the original stirrer of the dispute), servant and tenant to the Gentleman Porter, had since begun to build tenements upon the ground adjoining the Postern Gate. Before they were finished the Lord Mayor complained to the Council, who directed the work to be stopped. Heming had since finished that building and begun some new ones, some being ale houses and houses of suspicious resort. The refuse of the houses, &c, was daily cast into the Tower ditch. Heming had also enclosed the pond-head of the City's great ditch, and so prevented the citizens using it, reserving it for the use of his own tenants. Upon the day of the Lord Mayor taking his oath without the Tower Gate, an attempt had been made by the Warders to take down the sword borne before the Lord Mayor, and the ancient boundary stone without the Tower Gate had been removed. On the 15th of November last Mr. Lieu tenant made a procession, which they called a perambulation, with a great number following him with bills and other weapons, and some with pickaxes, &c, who cut the rails and pales of the citizens' gardens and broke them down with great violence by. command of the Lieu tenant. The Lieutenant further commanded those of the hamlet to bring certain children, about the age of twelve or fourteen, which children he caused at that perambulation to enter into and through those gardens by the pales which had been thrown down, to the intent, as he said, that they might in time to come keep memory of that entry ; and thereof remembrances were made in books, which, if no order were made to the contrary, might remain to the prejudice ofthe City. A sheaf arrow had been given to each boy for a remembrance that, upon such a day, they had made entrance in right of the Crown. In the December following the Steward of the Tower Court had called by precept an assembly, in the name of a Leet, without lawful warrant, who had made a new perambulation of such bounds as pleased themselves, and caused those hamleters and others so assembled to record, as they called it, those bounds to remain for time to come, whereunto none of the citizens had been called. Further the officers of the Tower had prohibited the horses of the citizens from passing by the postern or coming to the ditch-head, and many other like things had been daily done in contempt of the commands of the Council and to the danger of disturbance.

Three years since they exhibited their petition to the King concerning the differences between them and the Knights Commoners for precedency of place within the City, the consideration of which had been referred by the King to his Lordship and the rest of the Lords Commissioners for the office of Earl Marshal of England.

He requested the Lord Mayor to advise with the Aldermen, Recorder, and Counsel of the City as to the grounds that moved them to impugn this ancient privilege and custom never before contradicted, as to goods, and acquaint him with their determination in the matter, so that, if on receipt thereof and con ference with the Counsel of the Ports he could not satisfy the City, his defendants might plead next Term. 28th April, 161 2.

It was conceived by the Court of Aldermen that he was misinformed, and they wronged, by the pretence of the inhabitants that the Court intended to offer any trouble, when they sought but to govern, which they thought they might lawfully do, the place being within their jurisdiction. The demeanour of the persons was so contemptuous, both to the laws of the realm and the customs of the City, that it could by no means be given way to. 24th September, 1612. III. 105. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lord Chancellor, complaining that, upon an arrest made in London by one of the Sheriffs' officers (by virtue of the King's writ of execution) on the body of Mr. Palmer, Doctor of Divinity, the Lieutenant of the Tower had taken in ivithernam the body of Mr. Cambell, merchant, and had detained him three days in the Tower, in lieu of the said Doctor Palmer, which course the judges had certified to be unlawful, but, since the matter had been revived, they prayed his Lordship to grant the Plaintiff a writ of special certiorari to remove his body before him, or take such order for his release as he should think meet. 9th July, 1613.

They had been informed that their bailiff had taken and seized a sheep and a lamb from Francis Zachary, a butcher of Peterborough, and a Freeman of London, for refusing to pay toll there.

An Order of Council had been passed that all suits and controversies between the Liberties of London and the Liberties of the Tower should cease till Commissioners from the King should decide between them. He therefore requested him to throw out the bill and free the Liberty from expense and unjust vexation. Tower, 10th January, 1618. V. 16. Letter from Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower, to the Lord Mayor, stating that upon notice that the brickwork or foundation of a prison or cage was laid upon Tower Hill the work men would not desist, whereupon he had sent the deputy porter of the Tower to the Lord Mayor, to inform him that the place was within the Liberty of the Tower, and had sent with him the Constable of the Raleigh was in his custody.

By this marriage he became brother-in-law of Sir Edward Villiers, Viscount Grandison (ancestor of the present Earl of Jersey), half-brother of George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham. His eldest son by this marriage, who also became Sir Allen Apsley, was a zealous Royalist, and was successively Governor of Exeter and Barnstaple Castles, and, after the Restoration, Falconer to Ring Charles II., and Treasurer of the Household to James, Duke of York, afterwards King James II.

Notwithstanding which, the Lord Mayor had, in his own person, neglected and broken (if not contemned) the Order, and had seconded it with a building of more disburbance than the perambulation, and had used the messengers harshly, and turned the Constable out of doors, returning answer, with no other reason than his will, that the prison should be built there. Constables and forces had been sent to countenance the work, and on that night and the next day it was finished. A warder was sent to bring one of the workmen before the Lieutenant, but the man had been forcibly rescued by others sent by the Lord Mayor. He had complained of the matter to the Council, and had by them been required to put his complaint in writing, but he was most unwilling that any differences between his lordship and himself should exist. He therefore begged him to neglect those who had misin formed him, and cause the building to be removed into his own Liberty, which could be done within a quarter of a stone's cast, and thus, the cause being taken away, all disquiets would die, and he would join with his lordship to prosecute the performance of the Order of the Council, which would remove all differences between the Lieutenant of the Tower and the Lord Mayor of London for ever thereafter. Tower, 10th March, 1618. V. 19. Letter from the Mayor and Jurats of Tenterden to the Lord Mayor concerning the seizure by his officers of certain cloth purchased in BlackweU Hall, by Samuel Wilcock, an inhabitant of the town of Tenterden, being a member of the Cinque Ports, and certifying that Wilcock was a Freeman of that town, and a Com barron of the Cinque Ports, and entitled to the liberties and immunities thereof, one of which was that he might freely buy any goods or merchandize in BlackweU Hall, or elsewhere within the realm of England. Although similar seizures had often before been made, the privilege had always been allowed and the goods restored. They therefore requested his lordship to give order for restitution of the goods without expense by suit in law. Tenterden, 16th March, 161 8. V. 64. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lieutenant of the Tower, acknowledging the receipt of his letter concerning Mr. Hubbock, Chaplain of the Tower. The Lord Mayor found by the City Records that it was true the officers and attendants of the"], [474, "RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. 444 Tower ought to have the privilege of freedom from arrest on any plaint entered in the Compters or other Courts of London, but that if writs were issued from the Higher Courts, directed to the Sheriffs of London, though they might not come within the Tower or its Liberties to make arrests, yet such as they found in London they might and usually did arrest, the Sheriffs in such cases being merely the ministers of justice to superior courts, whose commands they must obey. He therefore begged that Mr. Hubbock would retain an attorney to appear for him, which would remove any further question, or if the Lieutenant could anywise show that their Liberties were otherwise than as stated, he would willingly yield to him so far as he could do it with safety to himself and the duty of his office. 13 th March, 16 19. V. 123. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the town of Yarmouth. They had been informed that certain citizens of London had been interrupted in the sale of a ship's cargo of salt in the Port of Yarmouth, contrary to the custom and privileges of the City, the Yarmouth officers pretending that they ought, by virtue of the Charter of that town, to have half the cargo at the rate the merchant paid for it. They begged that the parties might be allowed to dispose of their cargo, and that a friendly trial of the right in question might be had and the bonds of the parties taken to answer the town of Yarmouth for whatever should thereupon be found due to them. January, 1621. V. 128. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the town of Hull. Complaints had been made to them by divers merchants, Freemen of London trading in lead, that the officers of that town had levied upon that commodity a greater imposition by way of toll than had been, or of right ought to bc, taken from Free men of London. They requested that a conference and consent might be had between them and some of the City's counsel, and a friendly and legal trial ofthe right made. 12th March, 162 1. V. 133. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council. It was true that a constable being sent for by their Lordship's warrant, and apprehended by their messengers, they all came suddenly to the Court of Aldermen, when it appeared that the constable on his apprehension had questioned their authority to take him, and refused to go, whereby a great concourse of people had been gathered together in the street. The Court of Aldermen thereupon thought it the best course to send the Sheriffs instantly"], [475, "RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. 445 to attend the Council with the constable, because the messengers, publicly in the streets, and openly in the Court of Aldermen, had slighted the Lord Mayor, for which he had publicly reprehended them. Although some members of the Court had remembered that the Council's messengers had sometimes in such cases had recourse to the Lord Mayor to assist them with the City officers, yet neither the Lord Mayor nor the Court of Aldermen had expressed an opinion that no warrant from the Council could be executed in the City without first acquainting the Lord Mayor. 9th May, 1622, VI. 79. Order in Council reciting that the Lieutenant of the Tower (Sir Allen Apsley) on behalf of the King, and the Recorder and divers Aldermen on behalf of the City, had been heard before the Council as to informations delivered by them concerning the removal and carrying away, by divers persons of the Tower Liberty, of a markstone, placed about two years before on Tower Hill by the City's order, 'for distinguishing and bounding their Liberties from those of the Tower. As the differences appeared to be upon matter of right concerning the extent of each of their Liberties, and upon matter of fact as to the setting up and removal of the stone, and as no proofs had been produced on either side upon which the Council could determine, it had been ordered that a commission should be granted under the Great Seal to certain persons named, with authority to examine on oath, view records and writings, or take other effectual means to ascertain the extent of each of the Liberties and the truth of the matter of fact as to the removal of the markstone. The Council had been further made acquainted that there was question between the parties as to the extent of their Liberties in other parts adjacent to the Tower, for the settlement of which they desired some course to be taken. The Council therefore direct that the matter should likewise be inquired into by the Commissioners, upon all which questions the Commissioners should certify in writing to the Council, and that the Attorney General should prepare a Commission accord ingly for His Majesty's signature. They further direct the Lieutenant of the Tower to cause the stone to be delivered to Deputy Winton, to be laid down in the place from which it was taken, there to remain, but not to be set up on either side as a markstone until the Com mission had been returned, and the Board had given further directions in the matter. Date in margin, Sth November, 1626. VI. 1 14. Order of the Privy Council, reciting that the Recorder (Mr. Serjeant Finch) had informed them that Sir Allen Apsley, Knight, Lieutenant of the Tower, had at several times, by way of"], [476, "446 RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. znitheruam, taken and imprisoned there divers Citizens of London, and that such proceedings on the part of the Lieutenant were directly contrary to two Orders of the Council, dated respectively the 3rd October, 1695, and the 13th July, 161 3, both which Orders were grounded on a Certificate made to them by the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, the Master of the Rolls, and the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, on a former similar complaint. (The Certificate is set out at length.) The Council, after hearing the Recorder and Sir Allen Apsley, had ordered the immediate release of the Citizens, but deferred the full determining of the controversy till the present sitting, and, having now again heard the Recorder and the opinion of the Attorney General, they approved the former decrees of the Board, and, for prevention of future contentions, directed them to be observed by the Mayor and Commonalty and their successors on the one side, and the Lieutenant and officers of the Tower and their successors on the other side, as a final determination of the question. The Council, after giving instructions in detail as to the carrying out of this order, further direct the Lieutenant of the Tower so to exercise the rights and privileges of his place, and to hold such friendly correspondence with the magistrates and citizens of London, for the good of the King's service on all occasions, that the Council should not be further troubled with such complaints.

Order of the Court of (Aldermen), reciting that they had been informed that certain Citizens of London were molested by the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Gloucester sou non-payment of toll, notwithstanding that it had been certified to them, under the City Seal, that Citizens of London and their goods were, by charter, exempt from all toll throughout the King's dominions, as well on this side as beyond seas, and directing that, before other steps were taken, a letter should be sent to the said Mayor and Aldermen, suggesting that the matter should be lovingly heard and determined by counsel on either side, and that Mr. Bacon, the Remembrancer, should prepare and submit to the Court a letter accordingly. 22nd January, 1627.

At the Court at Hampton Court, 29th September, 1637. VII. 203. Answer of the Lord Mayor. Some of the Yeomen Warders who were the chief complainants dwelt and kept shops in the City, and were required, as other Freemen and inhabitants, to find watch and ward, or contribute to that charge, from which it did not appear they were ever formerly exempted. Upon their refusal he proceeded against such of them as resided and traded in London, according to law, and the rather, seeing that the Council, by letter of the 30th November, 1630, had directed the keeping of strong watches for the safety of the City without exempting any persons whatever. 6th October, 1637.

He had been informed that a broil betwixt his men and some of the Inns of Court had lately happened, and that some of his men had been committed to ward. If by their misdemeanours they deserved imprisonment, he was willing they should suffer. He believed that in all other respects they had behaved themselves honestly, saving that they played on the Sabbath day, contrary to orders and command unknown to them, for which they craved pardon, and begged that they might be set at liberty, when they should be sent into the country. He undertook that, should any other question arise they should be forthcoming. From his lodging in the Strand, Tuesday, 15S1. I. 232. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor. As he was desirous of understanding their opinion as to the punish ment of the lewd and seditious persons who committed the late rescue in Smithfield, they thought it good to signify that the principal offenders should be indicted and tried by a jury. Those found guilty should be, upon some open market day, tied to a cart, and from the prison whipped into Smithfield, and there set upon the pillory for a seditious rescue, but without cutting or nailing of ears. For the better execution thereof, such a guard should be appointed that the incon venience which happened lately did not fall out again ; the rest of the offenders should be dealt with as he thought best. 17th July, 1581.

The principal offenders had been tried this day at the Guildhall, and judgment pronounced against them according to the above Order, the execution whereof had been entrusted to the Sheriffs, which would be quietly and orderly carried out without inconvenience.

The Aldermen desired to acquaint him with the facts, and to ascertain his pleasure. 17th July, 1582. I, 376. Letter from Sir Thomas Bromley, Lord Chancellor, to the Lord Mayor. He had been informed that one of his Watermen had been committed to prison for a fray at Lyon Quay, whereof he was not only guiltless (as he said), but also apprehended and so hauled and pulled that he lost his purse. He was then committed to prison by Sheriff Webb, and discharged by him, since which, upon some further information, he had been committed again, together with Lord Nor reys's1 man. It was strange that he should be apprehended and imprisoned twice for one cause. He requested that they might both be released on bail. Weild Hall, Essex, 28th July, 1582. I. 622. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, with regard to the informations lately given to them against certain Serjeants and other Officers of this City for arresting George Pollard, for which they had been committed to prison by the Council's order. In order to ascertain the truth of the affray, he had examined the whole of the circumstances, and found that two of the Sheriffs' Serjeants and two Yeomen arrested the said Pollard, and were resisted by his friends. Fearing a rescue, they called upon the constables to aid them. After some dissembling, the prisoner, with the aid of his friends, escaped. Touching the allegation that the officers were armed, it had been proved that they only had their ordinary daggers and short weapons, which they commonly wore for the preservation of the peace and their own safety. For the sake of justice and the peace of the City, he requested the Council to consider the whole matter, and not to discourage the officers in the execution of their duty. 6th January, 1592.

They had received a complaint from certain porters of the City of London and the Liber ties, inhabiting in St. Katharine's and other places adjacent to the City, of an assault committed upon them in East Smithfield by certain riotous persons pretending to be porters, freemen of the City of London, and by that privilege seeking to exclude the rest from the exercise of that labour.

Letter from the Sheriffs to the Lord Chief Justice, acquainting him that at Whitsuntide last one Thurston Hunt, a prisoner in the Poultry Compter, was removed by Habeas Corpus, returnable before Mr. Justice Warburton,1 at his chambers in Ser jeants' Inn, Being brought there in the custody of one of their officers, Hunt escaped into the Temple, where he was rescued by the gentlemen of those houses. The officer was violently taken and cast into the Thames, and there drawn along through the stream in peril of drowning. They had thought it their duty to acquaint his Lordship and the rest of the Judges of the matter, and requested that some order might be taken for reformation of such insolences, too often practised by the gentlemen upon their officers, which could but bring an evil and dangerous consequence, such as they knew their Lordships (out of their love for those fellowships) had rather prevent than punish. (Circa 1618.) IV. 131. Letter from the Lords ofthe Council to the Lord Mayor. They had been informed that a very great disorder and tumult had been committed by divers unknown persons at the Spanish Ambas sadors house, in Barbican, upon an accident that happened by the hurting of a child. They required the Lord Mayor to take speedy and effectual steps for the safety of the Ambassador's house, and, if neces sary, put a good and substantial watch in those parts for the sup pression of any disorders which might arise on that or any other occasion, and to certify the manner of the tumult, by whom com- 1 Warburton, Sir Peter, of Lincoln's Inn.

The Ambassador was supping with the Earl of Worcester. The mob broke the windows and smashed in the door, and in a few moments would have wreaked their vengeance upon the man, when the Lord Mayor and Chief Justice Montague, with officers, arrived. The King ordered the Lord Mayor to go and ask Gondomar's pardon ; the Am bassador expressed himself satisfied, but the King issued a special commission to inquire into the assault, when seven unlucky lads were punished with six months' imprisonment and a fine of 500/. each. This was remitted at the request of Sanchez, the Secretary to the Embassy, and the King issued a proclamation pardoning the offenders, September 10th, 1618,"], [483, "RIOTS, TUMULTS, ETC. 453 mitted, the steps taken for its suppression, and such other circum stances as he should think necessary. 13th July, 161 8. 13th July, 161 8. IV. 134. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council in reply. The tumult arose in con sequence of a child being thrown down by the horse of one of the gentlemen of the Spanish Ambassador. The people, thinking the child had been killed, pursued him to the Ambassador's house in Barbican, and threw stones at the windows. The Lord Chief Justice and the Attorney General, who lived near, went there, and shortly afterwards the Lord Mayor and the rest arrived, and took steps for suppressing the tumult, and for the safety of the Ambassador's house. They had been unable to discover the authors of the tumult, which occurred in the night time, but some suspected persons had been committed to prison. Surgeons had examined the child, and found it had received no bodily hurt. They would endeavour to obtain further informa tion and acquaint the Council with the result. (Circa July, 1618.) IV. 135. Letter from Sir Robert Naunton to the Lord Mayor. The King, being dissatisfied with the result of the proceedings for correction of the offenders in the late tumult at the Spanish Ambas sador's, had directed the Council to provide for the remedy of that and similar abuses. They had, therefore, issued a Commission of Oyer and Terminer, wherein some of themselves were appointed to assist the Lord Mayor and the City authorities in this irregulated and dangerous season of the year. They had likewise heard of a later confluence of loose people about Crosby House, upon a Conventicle of Anabaptists there assembled. These warnings had moved him, in the absence of the rest of the Council, to put the Lord Mayor in mind of the watchful charge which rested properly with him for the govern ment ofthe City, for which purpose Sir George Coppin1 would attend him with the Commission, in order that a convenient time might be appointed for the execution thereof. Whitehall, 30th July, 161S. IV. 137. Letter from the Lord Chancellor (Lord Verulam) to the Lord Mayor and Recorder. There had latterly been sundry disorders and unlawful gatherings of people in the City and Suburbs. He requested the Lord Mayor, more than in ordinary manner, to repress all stirs and beginnings of stirs which might other wise happen in this vacant and solitary time, when the best were abroad and the worst people remained behind.

The French Ambassador i had desired that the punishment to be inflicted upon certain persons committed to Bridewell for their insolent and outrageous assault upon him and his people2 might be remitted, upon which the Lords of the Council had thought fit they should be discharged without further punishment, but that- first they should be carried by their keeper to the Ambassador, if he would see them, otherwise he was to be informed they were sent to ask his for giveness on their knees, and then to be set at liberty by his grace. York-House, 3rd December, 1619. V. 125. Letter from the Lords ofthe Council to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, with reference to disorders committed in former years at Shrovetide by apprentices and other lewd and ill affected persons. His Majesty expected a real reformation of the licentious and rude customs formerly used at that season', to which end they required effectual order to be taken that every man within the City's jurisdiction should keep in his servants and apprentices on the ensuing Shrove Tuesday, and not suffer them to go abroad on that day ; that a good and strong watch should be set 'at each of the City gates and other places, and that the Military Band, or a competent number of the Trained Bands, should be in readiness for the suppres sion of tumults. 2nd March, 1621.

They were informed that, by the fury and outrage of divers dissolute and disorderly persons, one Lambe had been barbarously murdered. His Majesty was very sensible of the scandal cast upon the Govern ment of the realm when the chief city, where his own person was resident, by the neglect ofthe magistrates suffered such a crime to be committed and pass unpunished, and was very highly displeased thereat, and had commanded the Council to require the Lord Mayor forthwith to ascertain the principal actors and abettors, to cause them to be apprehended and committed to prison, and proceeded against and punished in the severest manner. Whitehall, 15th June, 1628. VI. 151. Order of the Privy Council, reciting that they had been moved on behalf of the constables and other officers who had been committed for neglect of duty in not apprehending the principal actors in Lambe's murder, and who had promised, if set at liberty, to do their utmost to discover and apprehend them. The Council authorized the Lord Mayor to set them all at liberty on bail, except two servants of the City Marshal who, as they were informed, were present at the time. Their imprisonment should be strictly continued, unless they would undertake, by going abroad, to discover some of the offenders, for which purpose they might bc suffered to go out in the company of their keeper.

It. had come to their knowledge that upon an affray hap pening on the Exchange, in which Mr. Nicholas Lanier and others, His Majesty's servants in ordinary, mentioned in the Petition enclosed, were concerned, the constables and others who came had, under pretence of keeping the peace, in an unwarrantable and bar barous manner carried them along the streets to prison, refusing to take them first before a magistrate. The Council had heard some of the parties, but had found it was not a fit matter to trouble them witli, and therefore referred the examination of it to the Lord Mayor"], [486, "456 RIOTS, TUMULTS, ETC. at the same time intimating their opinion that if, as was stated, he was aware of the conduct of the officers, and had passed it over with out reproof, he had wilfully failed both in discretion and duty. The more they considered it the more they marvelled at the insolence of the officers, and the connivance of himself and other the chief magis trates of the City. They expected not only a good account of the examination in the matter, but the King required, not as a respect only, but a duty, that in future in any similar cases affecting his servants, proceedings against them should be by appeal and informa tion first to the Lord Chamberlain, or, in his absence, to such other principal officer as it concerned.

In this statement it is asserted that the Laniers had struck one Allen with their fists. Upon the arrival of a constable, they abused and struck him too, and went into Cornhill flourishing their drawn swords. The people began to throw stones, but were soon prevented. The Laniers being called upon, on their allegiance, to keep the peace, and deliver their weapons, had refused with oaths and blows. There being no other remedy, they were by force apprehended and reduced to reason by restraint of their persons. (Circa 1628.) VI. 178. Letter from Edward, Viscount Conway, to the Lord Mayor. He had heard of a great disorder committed last night in Fleet Street, and as he was going to Court, he would not be unprovided to report to the King all particulars of the matter.

Although sundry letters had been written by the Council, directing the con tinuance and maintenance of the said Mathew and his works, nothing had been done ; the Council had therefore thought it good once again to remind them of the annoyance, and require them to have a special care to maintain the said Mathew and his assigns, with whatsoever the City and Court of Sewers had promised him for the cleansing and conservation of the said sewer. 10th April, 1582.

Many other citizens, dwelling in distant cities and towns, had, when elected, either served the office or paid the fine fixed by Act of Common Council. Mr. Gardner, pretending that his duties would prevent him from serving, had refused, whereby the fine of \u00a3200 had become due to the Chamber and Commonalty of the City, and not to the Mayor and Aldermen. Nevertheless, on account of his lordship's request for a moderation of the fine, it had been agreed to reduce it to .\u00a350, which Mr. Gardner still objected to pay.

There had been no such order or intention of the Court. As touching the acceptation of the office of Sheriff by Mr. Alderman Martin, Her Majesty had wholly exempted him by charter, which she had commanded the City not to violate, nevertheless Mr. Martin had submitted himself by his own free will to take the office, having allowed unto him such benefits as by law pertained to the sheriff, and were not otherwise disposed by the laws of the City, or else to have his sparing continued, which sparing had been assented to and continued.

He had been commanded by the King to intimate that, the Citizens having elected his servant, Sir Lionel Cranfield,! as Sheriff, His Majesty, if the City (notwithstanding his former letter) would have the usual fine, according to custom, would pay it himself rather than lose his services. He requested them to elect another Sheriff, and discharge Sir Lionel. Northampton House, 27th July, 1614. III. 169. Letter from the Earl of Suffolk, Lord Treasurer, to the Lord Mayor. The King had written one letter, and the writer, by his command, another in behalf of Sir Lionel Cranfield, about the Shrievalty. Seeing they so little availed, His Majesty had resolved to pay his fine for him. He therefore prayed them to send back the King's letter and his own by some Aldermen. Northampton House, ist August, 1614. III. 170. Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lords of the Council, concerning the case of Sir Lionel Cranfield. As the King had, by a former letter on behalf of Sir Baptist Hicks, pro mised not to require a similar favour from thenceforth for any Citizen, they hoped he would countenance their present proceedings warranted by Charter. As to Sir Lionel's employments, none had been exempted thereby, though they had served His Majesty and the late Queen in more principal offices. They had thought it their duty to intimate these things to the Council, proposing to acquaint His Majesty with the proceedings of the Commons (i.e. the Commonalty) in whose dis cretions the matter wholly rested, and to beg their Lordships' media tion with the King, that it might not be offensive if in these cases they put into execution the ancient privileges and customs of the City. ist August, 1614.

It had been alleged by the City's Counsel that such course of election of Sheriffs, being Freemen of London, wheresoever resident (being one of the privileges belonging to the City), had been used and enjoyed time out of mind without interruption. The Court of Star Chamber declare that the City of London had, by ancient prescription, charters, and confirmations of His Majesty's Royal pro genitors, and by Act of Parliament, lawful and undoubted right of election of Sheriffs in manner aforesaid, and ought to enjoy the same, and direct that the election of the said Thomas Atkins should stand, and that he should serve the office accordingly. 23rd June, 1637.

They were informed that divers foreigners, dwelling within the City and Liberties, had not paid the moneys at which they were assessed towards the charges of the ships lately furnished for the King's service, as though they were exempted from such charges, being Non-freemen. They required the Court of Aldermen to call upon them to pay such moneys without further delay, and in the event of refusal to certify their answers to the Council. If, however, any of them were noblemen or Privy Council lors, they were not to be troubled with any such demand. Whitehall, 29th January, 1626. VII. 51. Petition of the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of London to the King. By letters of the Privy Council of the 4th August, 1626, the City had been required to set forth twenty of the best ships in the Thames, fully furnished and victualled for three months, for the defence of the realm, and by a second letter of the Sth August, 1626, had been required to perform the same on their allegiance. By Act of Common Council the Petitioners had enacted that the charge should be borne by the inhabitants of the City. The ships had been accordingly furnished, and they had been forced to dis burse large sums of orphans' money out of the Chamber, expecting"], [497, "SHIP MONEY. 467 to be forthwith reimbursed by the Citizens. Divers persons, out of opposition to that service, would not contribute, and had been dis trained upon for non-payment, and vexed and molested the constables and officers with suits at Common Law, who in defence were forced to plead long pleas, which were very chargeable and troublesome both to them and the City. The Petitioners therefore prayed that some course might be taken for freeing the officers from such suits, and for reimbursing the Chamber by those who were assessed. (Circa 1630.) VII. 52.

Writs were issued to London and the different ports, October 20th, 1634, ordering them to supply a certain number of ships of a specified tonnage, sufficiently armed and manned, to rendezvous at Portsmouth on the 1st of March, 1635. The writ is set out in ' Howell's State Trials,' vol. iii. p. 830-2, and also the proceeding of the Common Council, and their petition to the King against it. By this contrivance the King obtained a supply of ,\u00a3218,500, which he devoted to providing a fleet. Twelve of the Judges decided the King had the right to make the lev)-. In the speech of Lord Keeper Coventry to the Judges assembled in the Star Chamber on the 14th of February, 1636, he stated that, \" In the first year, when the writs were directed to the ports and the maritime places, they received little or no opposition ; but in the second year, when they went generally throughout the kingdom, although by some well obeyed, have been refused by some, not only in some inland counties, but in some ofthe maritime places.\" John Hampden refused to pay the tax, and was cited in the Court of Exchequer, June 12th, 1637 (see 'State Trials').

He had been informed that it was intended to draw a market of raw skins into Smithfield, within the railed walk there, which it was thought would be such an offence that it would be better to have it a laystall, as it had been, than to be made so filthy an annoyance. He hoped that it might not be attempted, lest His Majesty should be offended. 28th April, 1618. V. 7. Letter from Sir Henry Montague, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, to the Lord Mayor, expressing surprise that after so much money had been spent by the City about the paving and railing of Smithfield, with a view to reduce what before was a laystall to a place of use and beauty to that part of the City, it was now wholly neglected and suffered to lie so foul, and that there was no easy way across it. He had seen a lease granted by the City to the parishioners of St. Sepulchre of the pens in Smithfield, whereby they agreed to cleanse the same and remove the soil, except such as was made by reason of the Hay Market there. They contended that one Bourne, the City's Officer for the weighing of hay and straw, should be required to keep that portion of Smithfield clean ; but he, pretending that the profit of his office would not balance the charge thereof, likewise refused to cleanse it. Bourne offered that if the parishioners would for the present cleanse it, and the City would repay him the 200/. he paid for his office, and grant him a lease of it for thirty-one years, he would give 20/. per annum rent to the City, and be bound daily to cleanse the place : if this were not accepted, then he desired to have a lease for thirty-one years at 20i\\ per annum, and to be bound to cleanse it.

The Council had been given to under stand by the Lord Mayor that the inhabitants of the ward of the City called the Ward of Bridge -Without had complained of the Justices intermeddling, to take the musters contrary to their accus tomed manner, and the Council had directed him to signify their plea sure to them that they should forbear now and hereafter to charge and call the said inhabitants for service, but refer them to be mustered by the Lord Mayor and others deputed by his special commission of the City, according to former Orders. 28th January, 1583.

The Lord Admiral, in order to carry out the commission directed to him, touching the selling and eating of flesh in this prohibited time, within the county of Surrey, had appointed certain persons to execute the commission, who had offered to take bonds of the victuallers within the borough of Southwark. As some controversy might hereafter arise, he begged the Council to explain the meaning of the commis sion, and whether it extended to the borough of Southwark. 13th February, 1590. I. 662. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lord Treasurer. Being informed of a great disorder and tumult in Southwark, he went there, accompanied by one of the sheriffs, and found a great multitude assembled, the principal actors being certain apprentices of the Felt makers, out of Bermondsey Street and the Blackfriars, and a number of masterless men. Having made a proclamation and dismissed the multitude, he caused the authors of the disorders to be apprehended and committed to prison, to be further punished. To ascertain the cause of the disturbance, he sent for the constable and deputy of the borough, with divers other inhabitants of credit who were present. He found it proceeded from the steps taken by the Knights Marshalsmen to serve a warrant from the Lord Chamberlain upon a Feltmaker's servant, committed to the Marshalsea with others, accused by the said Knights Marshalsmen to the Lord Chamberlain, as they alleged with out cause of offence, for restraining of whom the apprentices and masterless men assembled themselves together, under pretence of their"], [505, "SOUTHWARK. 475 meeting at a play. He desired to know from his lordship anything meet to be done for the further punishment of the offenders. He had been informed by the inhabitants of Southwark that the Knights Marshalsmen in serving the warrant used very violent means : \u2014 that they entered the house with a drawn dagger, and after having arrested the party and certain others, committed them to prison, where they remained for five days, without making their answer. When the apprentices were assembled before the Marshalsea, the Marshalsmen within issued forth with drawn daggers and with bastinadoes in their hands, beating the people.

It alleges that the Refiners made the sugar of good wholesome sugar, and that in making large quantities of sugar some few loaves of necessity did not run clear, or were stained ; such loaves were sold as a second quality, and at a penny per pound cheaper, but they were made of the same substance as the best. The best refined sugar coming from the Low Countries was much worse than their second sort, and caused much false imputation upon their sugars. Mr. Barrett and others had been very forward in setting up strangers in the City to supplant them in their trade. The sugar complained of was not of their making, but provided purposely to bring their produce into disgrace. (Circa 161 5.) VII. 184. Letter from Lord Keeper Coventry to the Lord Mayor.

It was enacted by Parliament, in the second year of the reign of Henry VI., that it should be lawful for the pos sessors of nets called trinkes, if they were of assize, to fish with them in all seasonable times, drawing and conveying them by hand, as other fishers did, and not fastening their nets to posts, boats, and anchors, continually to stand day and night, to the destroying of the spawn and fry of fish, which law was still in force, but it contained no fixed assize, nor was the season of the year for fishing named. The con servators ofthe Thames from London Bridge to Yendall, and of the Medway, had in times past made divers laws and ordinances, which had continued from time to time, as well concerning what assize and mesh the said nets should be, and the times and seasons of the year, and the places where they should fish, to the great hindrance of the Petitioners. They prayed Her .Highness to appoint some person to view the said nets and engines, and to survey their manner of fishing, &c, and to grant them licences to fish again without prohibition.

It might lead to a similar imposition on English ships abroad ; 3. It would enhance the price of merchandize, to the detri- ment of trade and prejudice of the Customs ; 4. It would discourage the importation of victuals from abroad. As to the taking of ballast for ships, it would be fit and convenient if the strangers would willingly ballast their ships with river ballast and sand ; but they should not be compelled to do so. The suit of the Petitioners was unexpected, seeing the City had long before agreed to pay them, for the cleansing of the river, two pence for every ton taken thereout, and to find them lighters to carry it and wharves to cast it upon. But it appeared that they desired a further benefit by this suit, which they had concealed from the City for six weeks after His Majesty's reference, by which means the summer had been lost.

The second view was from Staines downwards to the bridge, to see whether the defaults presented were amended, and Wednesday next was appointed for that purpose.

Order in Council reciting that a Petition had been pre sented to them from the Master, Wardens, Assistants, and Commonalty of the art or mystery of Pinmakers of the City of London, showing that, the importation of foreign pins being prohibited by the laws of the realm, the King had, for divers good considerations, incorporated the Petitioners into a Company, limited to the City and three miles thereof, and had authorized them and their successors to seize all foreign pins imported, but a subsequent Order had directed that the Haberdashers should weekly take of the Petitioners such pins as they should make ready for sale, and should also have liberty to import and trade in foreign pins. The Haberdashers failing. in the performance of such Order, a second had been passed, leaving the Pinmakers to help themselves by course of law. But the Pinmakers alleged that, being a poor company, they were unable to carry on their trade for want of stock ; they had therefore entered into an agreement with certain persons of good ability in London, who had engaged to take their pins weekly for eight years, finding stock and money and other necessaries, whereby the kingdom would in a few years be supplied with home manufactured pins, provided that until then some tolera tion of a moderate importation of foreign pins might be permitted, which the Petitioners prayed might be granted for eight years, before the end of which time the terms of their apprentices would have expired, and they would have become masters able to employ a much larger number of persons in that manufacture. The Council being favourably inclined to the proposition, so far as it might be found reasonable, therefore ordered the Petition to be sent to the Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Middleton, Sir Thomas Bennett, Sir John Jolles, Mr. Alderman Bennett, and Mr. Alderman Pyott,1 that they, calling before them and advising with the Farmers of the Customs as to any injury to His Majesty in his Customs by the decrease of the importa tion of foreign pins, and also hearing the Petitioners and others interested, might report forthwith totheCouncil their opinions how the home manufacture might be increased and the use of foreign pins 1 Richard Pyott, or Pyatt, Grocer ; elected Alderman of Bridge Without, May 3rd, 1610 ; chosen Sheriff the same year.

IV. 62. Certificate from Sir Thomas Middleton and other Aldermen to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, upon the reference to them concerning the Petition ofthe Pinmakers' Company. They found : \u2014 1st. \u2014 As to the injury to His Majesty in his Customs by decrease of importation of pins. They had received from the Farmers of the Customs a medium of the subsidy impost and custom of pins in the Port of London, amounting to 1,288/. per annum. The Farmers were unable in so short a time to give a precise certificate as to the out ports, but estimated them at 300/. or 400/. per annum. These sums would be lost if the importation were wholly decayed ; but it was said the King would receive an increase of Customs for wire. 2nd. \u2014 As .to increase of the manufacture. The promoters of the Patent had offered, if they had the sole right of importation, to take from the Pinmakers, weekly, all pins made by them : the Haber dashers had also offered, agreeably to the former Order of the Privy Council, to do the same, and to give security to continue it without any breach in future, and to pay on receipt of the pins, either in money or wire, at the option of the Pinmakers. The Pinmakers had pre tended they would yearly increase the number of their apprentices, and so increase the manufacture, and for that purpose had offered to take three more apprentices every year until each of them employed thirty, but would give no security to that effect, so that it did not appear the State could rest assured of the expected increase of manufacture. 3rd. \u2014 As to how the Council could be certified yearly of the increase of pins made by the Pinmakers (amounting at that time to eleven thousand and one hundred dozen thousand yearly). They were of opinion the buyers, whether the Haberdashers or the promoters of the Patent, should keep a perfect account of all pins bought. 4th. \u2014 As to toleration of importation. They were of opinion a toleration was necessary, three times as many pins being imported as were made by the Pinmakers. But if the Haberdashers were appointed to take the pins and gave condition as promised, a Patent of sole importation would be needless, injurious to the King in his Customs, and to the subject. ech. \u2014 As to the proportion of Foreign pins to be imported.

IV. 98. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen. The differences between the Pinmakers' Company and the traders in pins had long been pending before the Board, and many orders and references had been made thereon, none of which had had any effect, owing to the default of one or other of the parties interested, except to give occasion for new complaints. Having heard all the parties and considered a Certificate from some of the Aldermen, the Council found that the Court of Aldermen were fully acquainted with the questions in difference, and had already made some overtures for settlement thereof. They had therefors thought it good to declare their opinions to the Court, and request them to order a final course in the matter according to the following directions : \u2014 1st. \u2014 As the Council thought it not meet that any Patent for the sole importation of pins should be permitted, so they held it not fit there should in future be any further seizure by the Pinmakers of foreign pins imported, but that importation should be permitted, seeing the Pinmakers were no way able to serve the kingdom in any reasonable proportion. 2nd. \u2014 Since it was very just that the Pinmakers and their work men should be relieved and encouraged by finding convenient sale for their pins, which had hitherto been neglected, the Council required the Court of Aldermen to direct that the Haberdashers or traders in pins should take all their pins ready for sale, and that the pins should be weekly brought to Pinmakers' Hall to be viewed, received, and bought by the traders, to be paid for in ready money unless otherwise voluntary agreed between buyer and seller."], [555, "TRADE AND -MERCHANDIZE. 525 3rd. \u2014 To prevent disputes as to the quality and value of the pins, the Lord Mayor should appoint such as he thought fit of the traders in pins, together with such as should -be chosen by the Pinners, to be weekly present when and where the pins were brought, and, on view thereof, to judge of their quality and price, and to arbitrate and settle any differences arising ; and in the event of their absence, or being unable to agree, the Lord Mayor should determine the matter. Since the parties for the most part were under the Lord Mayor's jurisdic tion, they desired him and the Court of Aldermen to put these measures in execution with such care and diligence that they might report their proceedings and any hindrances they experienced in the matter, and by whose default they were occasioned, to the Council. 1st February 1617.

Citizen of London, to take their pins, who had given bond hot to sell them at a higher rate than the Pinners sold them to the Haber dashers twenty years previously. Since the Pinners found the Com mittee had no authority to give them the benefit of the law, or restrain the sale of foreign pins, they had prayed the King that if the Committee could not determine the differences they should forthwith certify to that effect to the Lord Treasurer and the Attorney-General. They therefore prayed the Committee to certify and refer the same accordingly. (Circa 1618-19.) V. 23. Letter from the Company of Merchants Adventurers of England to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen. They had been informed of a contract made by their deputy for the sale to the Court of two thousand pounds' worth of gunpowder, at elevenpence per pound, lately received from Hamburgh, with which contract the Com pany (though it was to their loss) were contented. Since there was cause for suspicion of something ill intended against the said gun powder, they requested the Court forthwith to give order for the receipt and disposal of their portion thereof, the risk of which the Company conceived belonged to them. 29th April, 1619.

Until there were factors they were all quiet, and they did, even when taken at their best, rather harm than good. If left to themselves the inconveniences they occasioned would be insufferable. The Court particularly recom mended to the notice of the Commissioners, Maximilian Dancy and Thomas Starkey, as men who for their several misdemeanours should bc removed from their employments, and forbidden- to act as factors. 27th June, 1623.

Order of the Privy Council, reciting that the Board had been informed that a Merchant Stranger, dwelling in London, had received a quantity of French wine, some of which had already been ordered by the Lord Mayor to be destroyed as corrupt, and some had been in other parts refused, as unwholesome and hurtful. It had therefore been thought fit that the whole of it should be tasted and tried, to prevent the danger which might arise to the King's subjects by reason of the sophisticating and falsifying used by unwholesome roots and other mixtures, of which Parliament had taken notice. The Council, having heard the Merchant, desired the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to proceed according to the constitutions of the City for reformation of the abuse, and to ascertain where such wines had been sold.

Every Freeman that had in chattels or rent to the value of sixteen marks was to have a coat of mail (loricam), a helmet (cassidem), a shield, and a lance ; and so in proportion to his wealth. Another Assize of Arms was passed 36 Henry III., 1252, and in 1285 the Statute of Winchester. These made some alterations in the qualification and in the weapon. By 27 Edward I., 1298, armed horses were ordered to be provided. The Statute of 4 and 5 Philip and Mary, c. 3, 1537, changed the weapons for those of more modem construction.

Extract from Journal of the Court of Common Council, dated 4th May, 14 James I. (1616), reciting that a Letter from the Lords of the Council, touching the provision of arms, powder, and match within the City, was read, and referred to the Committee for Martial Affairs, to consider and report thereon to the Court of Aldermen. The Letter of the Lords of the Council is inserted at length. It states that in September, 1614, they had addressed their letters to the Lord Mayor for the mustering, furnishing, and training of the Trained Bands, and had also written similar letters in the following November for provision of such arms as were requisite for the service of the enrolled companies, and of the adjacent counties, which were to be furnished from the City. Since then they had heard nothing from the Lord Mayor, but had been otherwise informed that the City was altogether unprovided with arms, and could not furnish the trained numbers without borrowing one of another, and that there was scarcely sufficient match and powder in the whole City for one day's training. They therefore required, in His Majesty's name, \u2014 ist. \u2014 That effectual and real provision should be made of good and serviceable arms for the complete furnishingof the inhabitants of the City and counties adjacent resorting thither to supply themselves for their money, for which purpose a magazine of arms was always to be kept in readiness. 2nd. \u2014 That a competent store of powder and match should beat all times ready, the powder to be not less than one hundred lasts ; if such quantity could not at first be easily had, directions should be given for the delivery of some reasonable proportion out of His Majesty's store, at usual prices.

They had already signified their approval of the mustering and training of the Trained Bands on the nth April, but as Finsbury Field was somewhat out of the way, they had thought good, in order that the Foreign Ambassadors then at His Majesty's Court might take notice of the troops, that all the com panies should march through Fleet Street and the Strand into St. James's Fields, and be there mustered and trained. 7th April, 1622. VI. 136. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor. His Majesty, foreseeing the necessity in these hostile and dangerous times of having the Trained Bands within the kingdom kept in a state of warlike preparation, and being informed that they were generally ill-provided and furnished,\u2014 that not only were the defects great in those that showed their horses and arms, but that many borrowed horses and arms to show as their own,\u2014 and many presumed not to find them at all,\u2014 had determined to take a view and muster in person of the horse of very many shires, for which purpose the Lord Mayor was to give directions to all the horse companies within his lieutenancy to repair to the King's presence on Hounslow Heath by nine o'clock in the morning on the 21st April next, with their captains and officers, and to take care that the several bands were supplied with full numbers, and that the men, arms, and horses were fit for service. In the mean time His Majesty required the several troops to be trained and exercised frequently together, and the men to be directed two or three times a week, at their own dwellings, to ride their horses armed, and thus accustom themselves to the use of their weapons. As to recusants, every one of them should find such horse and arms as they were charged with, and the Lord Mayor or his deputy should appoint the men to serve for them. If any man should appear at the general muster with a borrowed horse or arms, or in other unfitting manner, His Majesty would proceed against him as a contemner of his commands and a betrayer of his honour and the safety of his kingdom. If any persons made default, the Lord Mayor should send them, in safe custody, before the Council. Lastly, as the apparent and imminent danger from foreign enemies on many sides awakened His Majesty's care, to advise of all preventions and remedies that could be thought convenient his pleasure was that the Lord Mayor, or one or two of his deputies, should attend the Court, on the 7th of May ensuing, to receive directions from the Council, and that he or they should bring with them the perfect state of all the military forces, both horse and foot, within his lieutenancy.

A sufficient number of the Trained Bands should be armed and in readiness to disperse any such tumultuous assemblies, and in the event of resistance to assail and disperse them in hostile manner as rebels. Further, strong and sufficient watches should be kept both day and night at the gates and other usual places in the City, for the prevention of tumults and disorders. Whitehall, 16th February, 1627.

The King expected a due and exact account of the performance of all the other directions contained in their Letter of the ioth January last. Whitehall, 25th May, 1628. VI. 149. Letter from the Lords ofthe Council to the Lord Mayor. The present state of Christendom was such as to require all things to be in readiness for defence, and because the times required more than ordinary care, they the more earnestly recommended the mustering and training both of horse and foot within the City, the defects of which had induced the King to determine to take a personal inspec tion of many of them, but which he had forborne on account of the cost it would have entailed. The King now expected the more care in the musters, and the remedying of defects therein. They would not repeat their former directions, especially those of the ioth July, 1626, but briefly refer to them, and request him to take care and give direc tions accordingly, and especially to send a speedy and exact account of the state of the City to the Council, who were required to render an account of all the counties by the ioth September next.

He should likewise take order that as many of the untrained men as possible might be furnished and exercised, and reduced into bands ; that the arms of recusants which had been sequestrated should be repaired and kept fit for use at the cost of the owners ; and that no recusants should be exempt from showing at every muster the arms chargeable upon them, but that the persons to wear their arms should be chosen by his Deputy Lieutenants, at the charge of the said recusants ; and that after every muster the arms should be delivered back and kept in sequestration as before ; that the several proportions of ammunition should be put in magazine for use on all occasions ; that a Provost Marshal should be appointed for the apprehending and punishment of vagabonds and idle persons not in any lawful vocation ; and that an exact account of the state ofthe forces should be sent to the Council by the ioth June next. 30th April, 1635.

As the office of Muster Master was better performed in the City than in any county in England, and could not well be performed by any one man, the setting of an officer over them would impair their authority ; and as it would be a new burden on the Citizens, it would be a discouragement to them, if not a cause for their withdrawing themselves from the practice of arms.

It had been determined by the City to restrain the carrying on of that trade in cellars throughout the City, since they found the practice to encourage drunkenness, whoredom, and receiving and harbouring malefactors. Touching this particular cellar, it had been found very inconvenient both to the inhabitants and the merchants who daily resorted to the Exchange. They therefore regretted that they could not comply with his Lordship's recommendation. 29th December, 1592. II. 345.

It was the more scandalous since the best houses, and such as were fit for the receipt of ambassa dors or persons of the best quality, were caught up to be converted into taverns. Moreover, besides selling wine, of late they had got (by what warrant they knew not) a trade of victualling, and sold more meat than the ordinaries or any other places of resort within the City. The Council charged the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, as magistrates, in His Majesty's name, not to permit any house to be converted into a tavern without their permission. Little attention had been shown to the former Orders and Proclamations concerning the restraint of new houses and divided buildings, and they required the Lord Mayor to suffer no new building, either within the City or in any garden or place within the Liberties, and to certify to the Council any persons who should attempt the same. 10th July, 161 2. III. 121. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council. For the avoiding of abuses in tippling houses to the main tenance of drunkenness and vice he had lately taken some courses with the Victuallers and Brewers of the City, and done his best to remedy these enormities ; and on account of the excessive quantities of barley daily converted into malt for the brewing of sweet and strong beer, had, with the advice of his brethren, limited the Brewers to the brewing of two sorts of beeronly, the one at 4s. and the other at Ss. the barrel, and had made proclamation thereof throughout the City. Lest the farmers and officers of his Majesty's Customs should allow the breach of the said Orders, by which his care would be frustrated, he begged that they might be instructed by the Council not to permit any beer to be transported without his knowledge. 31st December, 1613.

For preventing the incon veniences arising by their receiving into their cellars whatever quan tities of headstrong beer they liked, orders had been prescribed which had been approved by the Lord Chief Justice, and had since been confirmed by an order of the Council of the 27th March last. The cooks had lately very secretly and surreptitiously upon wrong sugges tions, obtained a new charter from the King, with a non obstante to dispense with all Statutes, Proclamations, Orders, and the afore said decree of the Council.

From the Rolls, ioth February, 16 17. V. 27. Letter from the Lords ofthe Council to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen. They had been informed by a Petition from the inha- bitants of the parish of St. Mildred, in London, that one ZacharieLether- land, who about seven years before had erected a tavern in the house wherein Sir Alexander Avenon kept his Mayoralty, in the parish of Allhallows, Bread Street, was about to erect another tavern in the parish of St. Mildred, in a house formerly inhabited by an Alderman. They were further informed that the City had within these few years become so pestered with taverns, that latterly the better sort of houses were taken up by vintners, at unreasonable rents, and converted into taverns, to the maintenance of riot and disorder, and the great incon- venience and disquiet of the neighbours. They understood that, by ancient Acts and Laws, made for the good government of the City, the number of taverns had been limited to forty, and their places assigned ; but it was said there were now upwards of four hundred. As the Vintners, above all other trades, were permitted to keep eight or ten apprentices apiece, they would in time increase to such a number as to be insufferable in a well-governed city. The Council, therefore, desired that some speedy remedy might be applied by Act of Common Council for the restraint of this enormous liberty of setting up taverns. They also desired to commend the Court of Aldermen for the steps already taken by them, forbidding Letherland to proceed further in the erection of the tavern, and required them to hold a strict hand with him, and, in the event of his disobedience, to commit him to prison until he had given security to desist his present enterprise and never to attempt the same again.

The King foreseeing the present dearth and scarcity had, by a late Proclamation, required that there should be an abstinence from flesh on fish-days, aud no suppers on fasting-nights, in inns, taverns, &c, which Proclamation contained no new thing, but pointed directly to laws and statutes formerly made and still in force for the keeping of fasting-days, and restraining the eating of flesh in Lent and on fish-days, as in the 2nd and 3rd Edward VI., cap. 19 ; 5th and 6th Edward VI., cap. 3 ; ist Elizabeth, cap. 5 ; and 35th Elizabeth, cap. 7. It seemed very strange to the King and the Council that a Proclama tion grounded on so many good laws, &c, and in a time of such scarcity, should be so much contemned in every tavern, ordinary, &c, in the City and suburbs, and the King was resolved to have it reformed ; and to make the reformation thereof within the City an example to other places, it was His Majesty's command that the Aldermen and their Deputies in their several Wards and the Justices of the Peace should strictly examine as to offenders since the Proclamation had been issued, and inflict due punishment on delinquents, and in future see the laws put in constant examination in victualling-houses, &c, and especially the Law of the 2nd and 3rd Edward VI., whereby offenders were to be imprisoned and kept with out flesh during their imprisonment. His Majesty further commanded that the Lord Mayor should appoint fit persons, to be nominated by the Fishmongers' Company, to make search and present offenders, and to see them punished, certifying every fourteen days to the Council. The officers of the Ecclesiastical Courts had been com manded by the King to take order, according to their jurisdiction, that offenders were punished according to the Statute 5th and 6th Edward VI., cap. 3. That the reforming of one abuse might not give advantage to the practising of another, the Court of Aldermen should take such a course with the Fishmongers' Company that the prices of fresh or salt fish were not enhanced, and that the markets were well served. The King's desire to see a reformation of these abuses by a fair way might thus be perceived ; but, if he found no speedy effect, he would think of a sharper course to bring such wilful contemners of the laws and of his commands to better conformity.

Letter from the Lord Mayor to Mr. Thomas Wilson, one of the principal Secretaries of State to the Queen. In obedience to his direction, touching the reformation ofthe Watermen of the Thames he had, in conjunction with the Aldermen, taken good orders for carrying the same into effect, for which purpose they had appointed eight new Masters,3 approved of by the complainers who desired reformation, and had required amongst other things that the Masters chosen should take an oath. The persons so appointed refused to take the oath either -to observe the statute or to make a true account, which, because it had not been limited by the statute, they could not be compelled to take. Two persons had, however, been appointed to hear what could be proved against the former Masters, that they might be punished, and to take order for the accounts for the past year, that they might be continued.

II. 30S. Letter from the Lord Mayor to the Lords of the Council, concerning a contribution to be given to the Watermen for their relief in this extraordinary time of frost, which had closed up the River Thames,1 and so deprived them of their living. Many other trades were suffering from the severe season, as bricklayers, plasterers, silk weavers, &c, and if they contributed to one Company, they must do the like for all.

Letter from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Lord Treasurer. At his request they had considered the com plaint made by the Founders' Company, touching the wrong done to them (as they pretended) and to other Her Majesty's subjects, by the use of leaden weights, they desiring that all small weights of lead under two pounds might be turned into brass. Having considered their request and the reasons alleged, they were of opinion that it would be very inconvenient to the sellers of small wares to be compelled to change their weights, they being poor men. As to the facility offered to the evil-disposed to tamper with the weights, it would also apply to those made of brass ; besides which the officers appointed to search for defective weights would discover any deficiencies, if they existed. Moreover the Plumbers' Company would have a just cause of complaint, that their living was taken from them. 26th April, 1592. III. 24. Letter from the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor. The King was informed that great and general abuse was committed in the City by the using of unlawful and unsized as well as false and defective weights contrary to the Statutes and Ordi nances of the Realm. They required him to take steps to search and seize all such weights, and cause them to be kept until further order ; for which purpose, having had experience, in the late Queen's time, of the care and diligence of Robert Thompson and James Harrison, then employed for the search and seizure of false weights, they requested his lordship to employ them again. 20th September, 161 1.
