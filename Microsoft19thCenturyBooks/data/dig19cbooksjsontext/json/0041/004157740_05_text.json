It is thus described in that Record. \u2014 \" Uluiet holds Peventone and Tunestan of the Earl. He also held it (in Saxon times) for two Manors. Here is a hide and half. There is arable land for in ox-teams. In demesne are i team and ii Serfs. The Manor was worth Ils. (in Saxon times). Now it is worth 12s.\"1 As to the vill of Tunestan, named in this passage, I cannot identify it with any modern locality. It seems indeed to have been lost in the 13th century, when Poynton maintained its Domesday hidage without any declared adjunct. Of Uluiet, the Saxon, I should observe, that this is now the eighth Manor in which such a person has appeared to have had an interest in the Confessor's time; and yet that it is the first in which he retained any interest at Domesday. As I have often ob served, the process of Saxon degradation continued after Domesday. No descendant of Uluiet can be supposed to have held Poynton ; and it is exceedingly probable that the Manor was annexed to the Honour of Montgomery as early as the reign of Henry I. Under the Lords of Montgomery, Poynton was held by a race of Feoffees, who took their name from the place. The earliest whom I can mention of this family was \u2014 Roger de Penniton, who attests a Deed of the Lord of High Ercall at the very close of the twelfth century. Philip de Peninton is found attesting several local Deeds be tween the years 1200 and 1212. In two instances Hamo de Penin ton (probably his brother) is his fellow- witness. Matilda widow of Roger de Peninton is found suing Philip de Peninton, for her dower, after an int rval of at least fifteen years from what I take to have been the period of her husband's decease. She sued him at the Assizes of November 1221, for thirds of one carucate and li virgates, Domesday, fo. 259, b, 2. IX. 1"], [20, "2 POYNTON. 2 gardens, and a Fishery, in Peninton. To this Philip pleaded that the Plaintiff already held two half- virgates in Peninton, and a mes suage and something else in Ercall, as the dower wherein she had been endowed at the Monastery-Gate (when married). He offered proof of this, but she, not denying it, was nonsuited.1 From his attestation of Deeds we may suppose Philip de Peninton (I.) to have been living in 1240. Stephen de Peninton, probably his successor, occurs as a wit ness in August 1245, and again about 1250. He was apparently deceased in 1255, leaving a son or brother, or nephew, named Philip, in minority. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of that date states as follows. \u2014 \" Pevinton is a hide and half, and pays 6d. motfee and 6d. stret ward. Philip de Pevinton is Lord of Pevinton, and is in the custody of his mother, by purchase from William de Cantilupe (the late Lord of the Honour of Montgomery) . And it is of William de Cantilupe's fee, and is held by an annual rent of a pair of gilt spurs, payable at Easter, to William de Cantilupe. It does no suit to County or Hundred.\"2 I cannot determine whether \u2014 Philip de Pevinton, who sat as a Juror for Bradford Hundred at the Assizes of 1272, was identical with the aforesaid Minor, or was his son. The latter seems improbable, because a Minor in 1255 will hardly have had a son of full age in 1272. Assuming then that the two were identical, we learn further that this second Philip de Penington was son of a former Philip ; for at the Assizes of 1272, it was found that Philip de Penynton had died seized of a messuage in Ercall, now held by John de Ercalu, and that Philip, son and heir of the said Philip, was now entitled to hold the same under the said John.3 I find this second Philip de Peninton as Juror or witness on very many occasions, viz. in 1274, 1276, 1277, 1292, and 1298. He occurs also as one of the Verderers of the Shropshire Forests in 1292 and 1296. Cotemporary with him was one Robert de Peninton (perhaps his brother) whom we have seen attesting a Deed about 1270-80.* In Easter Term 1284 Milisent, sister and coheir of George de Cantilupe, was suing the various tenants of her purparty in her late Brother's Barony, for their services.

At length in Hilary Term 1288 Philip de Penynton acknowledged his obligation to Milisent de Montalt\u2014 so called with reference to her first hus band.1 Meantime the Feodaries of 1284-5 specify Philip de Penynton's tenure to be under Milisent la Zuche, and state her to hold it of the Fee of Montgomery, but the service due thereon is not men tioned. Between the years 1272 and 1284 Philip, Lord of Penynton, gave to Haghmon Abbey two meadows (Overmedewe and Nether medewe) and five sey lions in Penynton. Witnesses, John de Ercalwe, John fitz Aer, Robert Corbet, knights.2 On July 3, 1319, we have a Deed attested by three brothers, \u2014 Geoffrey, John, and Philip, de Peninton.3 Of these, probably the sons of Philip de Peninton (II.) , \u2014 Geoffrey de Peninton was undoubtedly the eldest, and Lord of Poynton. As Geoffrey de Penynton he stands first witness to an Ercall Deed of February 14, 1323. Before the year 1328 Geoffrey had been succeeded by his son and heir, \u2014 Philip de Peninton (III.). On May 25, 1334, Philip de Penin ton releases to Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon, a parcel of land in Haghmon Wood. Witnesses, Sir William de Erkalewe, Sir Robert Corbet of Moreton, knights ; and Master Robert de Preston.4 By a Deed variously dated on June 12 and June 24, 1334, Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon, demises to Philip fitz Geoffrey, Lord of Penynton, a parcel of waste land, for a rent of 2d. in perpe tuity. On March 26, 1340, Philip, son of Geoffrey de Penynton, releases to the same Abbot his right in 4^ acres of land at Upton.

Some Saxon Uffa will have established this settlement. The name Uffington is in full, the town of the children of Uffa. In Edward the Confessor's time the Manor was held in severalty by two Saxons, Genut and Elveva.1 At the Conquest of Mercia Earl Roger bestowed it on his follower, Helgot. Hence Domesday says, \u2014 \" The same Helgot holds Ofitone. Genut and Elveva held it, for two Manors, and were free. Here are v hides, geldable. There is arable land for xn ox-teams. In demesne there is a team and half, with in male and mi female Serfs; and (there are) m Villains, ii Boors, and n Frenchmen, ,with n teams. Here is half a league 1 It is singular that the same Genust and LElveva appear to have had shares in the distant Manor of Stantune, and there also to have made way for Helgot, and for the Castle, to which he gave a name (su pra, Vol. IV. p. 51)."], [23, "UFFINGTON. 5 of wood. The value of the Manor in' King Edward's time was 30s. (per annum). Now it is of the same value.\"1 Helgot's further connection with Uffington is shown in his grant of Moor, and of a Fishery in the Severn, to Shrewsbury Abbey. This was probably soon after Domesday and in the time of Earl Roger. The Charters of Henry I. and Stephen both particularize the grant, explaining that Mora was near the River Severn, and that it was called Mora with reference to a small wood adjacent thereto. This etymology shows perhaps that the Charter which embodied it was drawn up by a Norman Monk : for the primitive meaning of the Saxon word, Mor, is waste-land, either mountain or fen, but not wood. Stephen's Confirmation specifies Helgot's gift to have been a hide of land. We shall see that, though Monkmoor was detached from Uffington, both physically by the River Severn, and manorially by Helgot's grant, yet Uffington putatively retained its Domesday hidage in the 13th century. I have spoken of Richard de la Mare, himself or his wife a de scendant of Helgot, and living in the reign of Stephen or of Henry II.2 This Richard, though Ancestor of the late Lords of Holgate, was only a Feoffee and Relation of the earlier Barons. In fact he held Uffington under them. The Confirmation of Pope Alexander III. to Haghmon Abbey bears date May 14, 1172. It enumerates the following grants of Richard de la Mare and Robert his son, viz. (1) the mill of Pune lege, (2) half a virgate and one noke in Uffinton, and (3) Ledel acre, which was between the boundaries of Sundre (Sundorn) and Uffington. One of Henry II.'s earliest Confirmations to Haghmon alludes incidentally to the Abbot's Tenants at Offinton. This adds a much higher antiquity to Richard de la Mare's grant than I could other wise establish. The Charter shall be more fully described under Astley. Another Confirmation of the same King recites that \" Ro bert de la Mara had given to the Abbey one mansure in the vill of Offinton, with the Mill of Pimbeleg, which land and Mill his father had previously given to the Canons.\"3 Pimley Mill was, I should observe, in Uffington Manor. I have shown elsewhere how the Haughmond Canons improved Richard de la Mare's gift by ob taining the Pimley side of the stream.4 .

This led to a lawsuit, indicated by the follow ing entries on the Plea- Rolls. \u2014 October27, 1194, Aunies de la Mare appoints Ralph de Har dern, her husband, to be her Attorney in a suit of land against the Canons of Hagemont.

Witnesses, William fitz Alan, John le Strange.\" Subsequently Thomas Mauduit, in the presence of William and Robert his brothers, released the Abbey from the above obligation to maintain a Canon of his selection. In future he would require nothing but the masses and prayers of the Convent. We may now follow the history of Uffington as an estate of Haughmond Abbey, but still held under the Barons of Holgate. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255, says as follows. \u2014 \"The Abbot of Haweman holds the vill of Offinton, by gift of Robert de la Mare, and in frank almoign, of William Mauduit's Barony of Castle Holegod. The Manor does no suit to County or lesser Hundred- Court, but only to the Great Hundred- Court, twice yearly and now stood in the same relation to the Abbot of Haughmond. 3 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 62. 1 Rot.

This fact was stated in an Inquest, which I have before quoted.2 The Bradford Tenure- Roll (about 1285) says that \" the Abbot of Haughmond holds the vill of Uffyn ton in free alms,\" and that \" the vill was of the fee of Castle Hole god and used to be geldable ; but the Templars changed its status, by attracting it to their Liberty of Castle Holegod, which Liberty Robert Burnell Bishop of Bath now holds.\" The Taxation of 1291 values the Abbot of Haghmon's temporali- ties at Uffeton as follows. \u2014 Two carucates of land, worth yearly . . . .\u00a3110 0 Assized rents, producing yearly 0 18 0 A certain meadow, worth yearly 0 10 \u00a32 9 03 At the Assizes of 1292, the Bradford Jurors represented how King Henry III. had been seized of 3s. per annum for the stretward and motfee of Offynton, and how the said due had been withdrawn by the Abbot of Hawemon. The Abbot appeared and stated that on entering office he found no such burden on the vill. The King however recovered the due and its arrears. The Abbot was further questioned for having withdrawn the Hundred-suits of Walcot and Uffinton, 12 years back. The Crown recovered the Suit of the Sheriff's- Tourn, worth 2s. per annum, and 24s. for arrears thereof: but the Abbot proved that the Crown had never been seized of the lesser suit ; viz. that due every third week to the Hundred-Court.4 This, or a similar, prosecution about the Suits of Bradford Hun dred is somewhat garbled in the Haughmond Chartulary. There it would appear that the Abbot got a dismissal sine die on both points, viz. his liability to attend the greater, as well as the lesser, Hun dred Courts. Another document in the same Chartulary is perhaps rather an explanation than a falsification of the Plea- Roll. It states that at the Assizes of 1292 \" Gilbert, Abbot of Haghmon, procured that 1 Rot. Hundred. II. 57. 1 Pope Nich.

To Richard Colfox, Bailiff of Uffyngton and Muryden, he paid a salary of 40s. per annum.1 As Undertenants in Uffington, I may name Richard fitz Ra nulf of Huffiton and his wife Edith, who, in February 1256, enfeoff one Simon fitz Gervase of Cotes in 3 acres at Cotes (Coton Hill) . Also|there was a Walter Cresset of Uffington, living in 1339 and 1349, but who, as well as some other Tenants here, has been men tioned elsewhere. UFFINGTON CHAPEL. Uffington Manor was originally in the Shrewsbury Parish of St. Alkmund, which, as I have before observed,2 included Sundorn also. I should attribute the foundation of a Chapel here to the De la Mares or to the ancient Chapter of St. Alkmund, rather than to the later representatives of either party. That is neither the Canons of Haughmond, as Lords of the Manor, nor the Canons of Lilles hall, as Impropriators of St. Alkmund's Church, were likely to have founded this district-chapel. Whenever founded, this Chapel remained for centuries with all the features of an affiliation of St. Alkmund's. The Abbot of Lilleshall had the Great-Tithes of Uffington ; and the Chapel was of his Advowson, as Rector of St. Alkmund's. Much disputation seems to have existed between the Abbeys of Lilleshall and Haughmond with respect to certain tithes of Uffing ton.3 Haughmond, it will be remembered, was exempted by Papal Privileges from paying tithes on its novalia, and its working cattle. Between the years 1220 and 1250, Lilleshall quitclaims to Haugh mond the small-tithes of all animals which Haughmond had in the vill of Uffinton, also the tithes of Assarts, Vivaries, and Mills,4 then existing. This settlement was made in the presence of the Abbot Canons of Haughmond. The Mill itself was originally in Uffington Manor (supra, Vol. VII. p. 304), and I suppose its pre cinct had come to be so reputed. Hence the Abbot of LilleshaU's title to deal with the tithes. 1 Valor LEcclesiasticus, III. 192, 193. \u00bb Supra, Vol. VII. p. 280. 3 Haughmond Chartulary, fos. 217-b, and 218. 4 This alludes to Pimley Mill and the farm which had been added thereto by the 2 IX."], [28, "10 UFFINGTON. and Prior of Shrewsbury, the Prior of Wombridge, and Geoffrey Griffin. Another, and, I think, later arrangement between the two Houses, divides the tithes of nearly thirty tenements and gardens, which all went under the name of assarts. In some cases Haugh mond takes two-thirds, and Lilleshall one-third, of the said tithes. In other cases, Haughmond and Lilleshall respectively take the whole tithes. On September 9, 1478, Robert, Abbot of Lilleshull, and John, Abbot of Haghmon, came to another kind of agreement on this subject. The former now gave to the latter a 99 years' lease of all tithes, oblations, fruits, and profits, which belonged to the Paro chial Chapel of Abbot John's vill of Uffinton, and also of all tithes, &c, of the same Abbot's ferm or Grange of Pimley, except the tithes of such meadows and assarts as already belonged rightfully to Haughmond. The rent reserved to Lilleshall was 40s. per an num, and the Abbot bound his Convent to renew the lease, under a penalty of \u00a39. Besides paying this rent, the Abbot of Haughmond was to provide a Chaplain, secular or regular, to serve Uffington Chapel, and to administer the sacraments to the Parishioners as heretofore. Also he was to be responsible for all other dues belong ing to the said Chapel except a portion or pension, \" if there was one,\" due to the Parish Church of Holgate. 1 The Valor of 1 534-5 does not recognize the existence of Uffing ton Chapel ; neither do the Abbots of Lilleshall and Haughmond include, in their returns of income and expenditure, any notice of the above transaction. As to Early Incumbents of Uffmgton, we need not, after what has been said above, look to the Diocesan Registers for any evi dence of their succession. In the present instance, however, we have the means of showing how such Cures were provided for, when the Diocesan Bishop did not, or could not, exercise any supervision. The Abbot of Lilleshall, as Rector of St. Alkmund, appointed whom he would to be Chaplain of Uffington, or what was worse, sold the 1 This looks as if Uffington Chapel had been founded by some ancient Lord of Holgate, who had charged it with a pen sion to the once Collegiate Church of Hol gate. The pension was apparently obso lete, or nearly so, at the date of the above Lease ; and I find no other mention of it. I think little of the possibility that Bishop Burnell, while Lord of Holgate, may have charged Uffington with this pen sion.

One document will prove this. We have seen a certain Herbert de Etingham, Chaplain, attesting certain grants to Wombridge Priory about the year 1235.1 A Deed in the Lilleshall Chartulary acknowledges the terms on which \" Herbert de Ettingeham, Chaplain, had received from the Abbot and Convent of Lilleshull their Chapel of Uffinton, to farm for the whole term of his life. He will pay the Abbot an annual rent of 2 merks for the same. Any right pertaining to the Mother- Church of St. Alkmund is to be preserved. If the Lessee neglect to pay his rent at stated terms, the penalty is to be one merk. He will sustain all burdens of the Chapel, temporal and spiritual, and will provide for its services.\" How the latter duty was performed we need not inquire. \u0153curtcote* This was one of the Manors which Domesday records to have been held by Robert fitz Tetbald under the Norman Earl. \u2014 \"The same Robert holds Udecote, and Tochi holds it of him.

As Richard Wudecote he stands wit ness to a Deed of uncertain but ancient date, which I have quoted under Hatton.1 The Pipe-Roll of 1176 tells how Richard de Wude cote had been amerced \u00a32 for not producing his brother Roger to undergo trial. All that I can say further of Richard de Woodcote is, that he had a daughter, Avelina, to whom, on her marriage with Adam de Doditou, he gave certain field-land in the Abbey Forgate of Shrews bury.3 The said Avelina had also a daughter Hawise, who became wife of Adam son of Adam de Chetwynd. Robert de Woodcote (I.) was probably son and heir of Richard. Had he not been so, he would not have succeeded to Woodcote in preference to Richard's other descendants. Robert de Woodcote's earliest appearance is about the year 1191, when we have seen that he had disseized another of a tenement at Cheswell, near Longford.3 On November 24, 1194, Robert de Wodecot was one of three Knights who appeared at Westminster as Visor in a Shropshire Suit already described.4 The suit whereby, in 1200-1203, he en deavoured to obtain Aston Boterell has been also alluded to.5 It convinces me that Robert de Woodcote was descended from Tochi or Tochil, the Domesday Lord of both Woodcote and Aston ; and perhaps we may farther conclude that Tochi was akin to Aluric or Elric, the previous Saxon Lord of both Manors. At the Assizes of 1203 Robert de Wodecot was one of the Knights empanelled in causes of Grand-Assize. At this time Ave lina de Dutdinton, his presumed sister, was a widow, for she es soigned her attendance at these Assizes. Within fifteen years, as I think, of this time, Robert de Wode cote stands first witness of a Deed whereby Avelina, formerly wife of Adam de Doditun, gives to Adam, son of Adam de Chetwinde, in frank marriage with Hawise her daughter, a rent of 12d. receiv able yearly from land held by Stephen de Hawemag, together with a full half of that field-land in Monks-Foriete (Shrewsbury), which Richard de Wodecote, Avelina's father, had given to herself, on her marriage with the aforesaid Adam (de Doditun). The other wit nesses of this Deed are Adam de Brunton (of Longford) and Alan fitz Jordan (of Shrewsbury) .6 About the year 1215 Thomas de Costantyn grants to Robert de ' Supra, Vol. II. p. 169. 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 177. 3 Supra, p. 106. 4 Supra, Vol. I. p. 47. 5 Supra, Vol. I. 224. 6 Salop Chartulary, No. 177."], [31, "13 WOODCOTE.

This Deed has the attes tations of Robert de Terroys (perhaps Teneraye), Hugh de Upintou, and Robert de Stanton.1 About the same time, Robert de Wodecotte stands first witness of a Deed which I have quoted under Tibberton.2 * Robert de Woodcote (I.) probably died about the year 1220; at least we have had mention in November 1221 of his widow Milisent and his successor Robert.3 His grant to Lilleshall Abbey must be taken as a closing act of his life, seeing that it was accompanied by a bequest of his body, in burial. It was of certain land in Saker lawe (Shakerley) which the Grantor seems to have inherited from his Uncle, (avunculo) Robert, who had had \"it by the feoffment of Sir Richard de Beaumeys. The services due to the Lord of the Fee are reserved.4 Milisant, wife and widow of Robert de Wodecote (I.), was probably an heiress. In her widowhood and liege power, for the souls' health of herself, her ancestors, and successors, she gave to Lilleshull Abbey, together with her body (in burial), a virgate of land in Horselawe, one noke of which was held by Adam White. Robert de Wodecote (II.), calling himself \"son and heir of Robert de Wudechot,\" confirmed this grant of a virgate in Horse lawe, reserving the scutage assessable thereon, unless it should appear that the land had been freed of scutage under the franchises of Lilleshull Abbey. This Confirmation, the said Robert handed over to the Canons in the full County-Court of Stafford in the time of that \" noble personage, Henry de Audley, then Sheriff.\"5 This notification serves to date the deed as having passed either between 1218 and 1.220 or else between 1227 and 1232. I prefer the last limits, because it seems probable that the Confirmation passed after Milisant de Woodcote' s death, and she was living in 1221. Orslow, I should observe, was a member of Church-Eaton (Staffordshire). Hence we hear also of a Charter by Sir Adam de Brimton, Knight. Lord of Eyton, confirming Milisant de Wood cote's grant.

Wit nesses, Richard de Leyghton, Robert de Brocton, Adam de Cherle ton, &C.1 Also between 1220 and 1224, Thomas de Constantyn gave to Wombridge the whole wood with its appurtenances, which he had sold to Sir Robert de Wodecotte, so that the Canons pay the Grantor and his heirs I'M. yearly. Witnesses, Baldwin de Hodnet, Hugh Forester (of Bolas, I presume), William de Hedley.2 About the year 1241, Robert de Wodecote was second of the Jurors who decided the lands of Lilleshull Abbey not to be liable to the custom of canine expeditation. Again in 1249 we have Robert de Wodecot as Foreman of a Leegomery Inquest, and about 1250 we have him attesting Geoffrey Griffin's grant of Howie to the Abbeys of Lilleshull and Haughmond. I am nearly sure that about this time there was a step in the succession of the Lords of Woodcote.3 At all events, I venture to state that it was \u2014 Robert de Woodcote (III.), who, in his grant to Buildwas Abbey about 1253, styles himself, \" Robert, son of Robert de Wodecote.\" The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes Wodecot as a Manor of three hides, and as paying 12c?. (yearly) for motfee, and 126?. for stretward. \" Robert (de Wodecot) was Lord of the Vill, holding it of the fee of Henry de Persy, and doing due suit to County and Hundred. The Manor was geldable.\"4 Robert de Woodcote (III.) seems to have had a sister married to Michael de Morton. To Michael, son of the said Michael, and therefore his own Nephew, Robert de Woodcote sold the fee-simple of Eye, but, as we shall see, without barring the dower of his wife, Isabella. All that I shall say further of the third Robert de Woodcote, is, that, being deceased on May 26, 1278, a Writ of Diem clausit 1,2 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit. Upin ton, Nos. CXV. CXIIJ. 1249-1253, inclusive. But in February 1262, they being dead, their heirs had to answer for their receipts. I infer that Robert de Woodcote (II.) died about 1253. Robert de Woodcote of 1262 is expressly .named as his son and heir. 3 This idea is confirmed by the Forest- Roll of 1262. Robert de Woodcote and another were Agistators of the Hayes of Wellington and Mors, and so responsible for the Autumnal pannage of the years 4 Rot. Hundred.

The said lands were valued at 30s. 8d. per annum. Thomas, son and heir of the deceased, was found to be 23 years of age and more.1 It is probable that Thomas de Woodcote alienated the mesne interest of all his estates to William Rondulf, a thriving Burgess of Newport. John and Philip de Wodecote, who appear on an Edgmond Inquest in January 1283, were probably Cadets or Undertenants. William Rondulf of Newport, with whom I now proceed, occurs on general and local Juries in 1283, 1290, 1292, 1296, 1300, and 1302. The Feodary of 1284 says that \" William Randulfe holds the vills of Wodecote and Eye of Henry de Percy, who holds of the King in capite.\" The nearly cotemporary Tenure-Roll of Brad ford Hundred repeats this information, adding, that Michael de Morton was William Rondulf's Feoffee as regarded the vill of Eye. Of this vill I shall speak elsewhere. William Rondulf had several sons, of whom I shall here mention Geoffrey and Simon. Geoffrey, the eldest, had even in his Father's lifetime attained a high position as a Burgess of Shrewsbury. He occurs from 1288 to 1323 in various capacities. He was in office as Bailiff of Shrewsbury six times in and between the years 1290 and 1323. He was returned as a Burgess of Parliament for the same town no less than nine times in and between the years 1295 and 1318. On the last occasion Simon Rondulf (his brother) was one of his Manucaptors. It appears that the third Robert de Woodcote had another sister, Helen, whom he had enfeoffed in a parcel of land at Woodcote. About the year 1290 \" Helena, daughter of Robert, formerly Lord of Wodecote, gives to Simon, son of William Rondulf of Neuport a parcel of land in the field of Wodecote, the Grantee performing such homage and service as were stipulated for in the Charter which she (Helena) had from her brother Robert. Witnesses, William Rondulf of Neuport, William, son of Michael de Morton, and John, his brother.\"2 William de Morton, the second witness of the above Deed, had a son Edmund, between whom and Geoffrey Rondulf there arose much litigation about Woodcote.

William de Morton, recovered, by process of law, two-thirds of the Manor of Woodcote against Geoffrey Rondulf.1 Hence it came, I presume, that in the Nomina Villarum of 1316 Edmund de Morton is set down as Lord of Woodcote. It further appears that, relying on the above sentence in his favour, Edmund de Morton disseized Geoffrey Rondulf of certain parcels of Woodcote which proved to be not included in the above two-thirds. Rondulf hereupon brought a second action, and in Hilary Term 1322 recovered the following parcels in the Manor of Wodecote juxta Het hull, viz. 2 messuages, 1 Water-Mill, 1 virgate, and 30 acres of land, and a piece of ground measuring 300 perches by 200 perches, which were no parcel of those two-thirds of the Manor to which Morton was entitled.2 Woodcote Chapel. This Chapel has architectural features, which prove it to have been founded at least as early as the 12th century. Its subjection to the Mother-Church of Sheriff Hales, a status which it still retains, naturally obscures its early history. Its Incumbents were the Vicars of Sheriff Hales, who probably served it by Deputy. The said Vicars were themselves presented by the Prior of Ware, or by some other Proctor of the Abbot of St. Evroult of Uticum,3 who was Impropriator of Sheriff Hales. Parochially Woodcote was in the Archdeaconry of Stafford, and the Deanery of Lapley and Trysull. CJe \u20acpe- The Domesday notice of Woodcote is immediately succeeded by the following supplementary entry, in paler ink than the body of the Record. \u2014 \" The same Robert (fitz Tetbald) holds a Manor of one virgate of land, and Tochi holds it of him.

West of Leighton and South of Eaton Constantine the River Severn forms three sides of a square. The land thus enclosed is now known as the Eye Farm. This was Robert fitz Tetbald's anonymous Manor, and from him the Seigneury, like that of Woodcote, passed to Percy. So also Tochi's tenancy passed to the Woodcotes ; and it was their tenure of Eye which brought the Woodcotes into this neighbourhood, and induced them to make those purchases in Leighton and Eaton Constantine which have already been de scribed. Robert de Woodcote (III.) sold Eye (that is the fee-simple) to his Nephew Michael,\u2014 son of Michael de Moreton, by * * * de Woodcote : but on the said Robert's death (in 1278), his widow, Ysabel, seems to have claimed dower in Eye. So I interpret a Deed whereby it was agreed between \" Michael, son of Michael de Morton and Dame Ysabella, late wife of Robert, Lord of Wode cote,\" as follows, viz. that Michael conceded and demised to Ysa bella, one-third of his land of E, which land he (Michael) formerly bought of Robert, Lord of Wodecote, his Uncle (avunculo) ; \u2014 to hold to Ysabella for life at a rent of one pair of white gloves. Witnesses, Bertram de Burgo, Michael de Morton, Hugh de- Weston, Richard de Leycton.1 We have seen that the mesne tenure of Eye, like that of Wood cote, passed between the years 1278 and 1284 from Thomas de Woodcote to William Rondulf of Newport, and that in or about the year 1285 Michael de Morton was holding Eye under William Rondulf. The following Deed, which perhaps passed fifteen years later, I take to be by Richard de Leighton (V). It shows conclu sively that the Manor, so continuously mentioned in connection with Woodcote in other records, and now held by Michael de Morton, was in fact the Manor of Eye.

Several of the localities named in the present Deed will be found to corre spond with the proposed boundaries of Leighton Park.2 SBroctoattiitte* The Cambro-British word Wrch signifies, \" that which is high or round.\" The town of Wrexham in North Wales was probably so called with reference to the mountainous range adjacent. So too in Shropshire, Wroxeter and Wrockwardine got their names, one as being a City or Station (castrum) near the Wrekin, the other as being a worthing, or village, under the same mountain. In Saxon times, Wrockwardine was a royal Manor, and Caput of the Hundred to which it gave a name. Such Manors are usually if not uniformly found in Domesday to be classified as demesnes of the Palatine Earl. \u2014 \" Earl Roger holds Recordine. King Edward held it.

Wrockwardine, with the exception perhaps of one of its Bere wicks (Cherlton), reached the hands of Henry IL, in the usual course, as a Manor of Royal Demesne. Of the severance of Cherlton from the central Manor I will speak elsewhere. The re puted fiscal value of Wrockwardine in 1156 was \u00a314 per annum. So then, from the year 1156 to the year 1171 inclusive, Wrockwar dine may be taken to have annually contributed \u00a314 to that sum of \u00a3265. 15s. for which the Sheriff was accountable as the Firma Comitatds. In the year 1172, and while Wrockwardine was thus reputed to be a Manor of \u00a314 fiscal value, King Henry II. assigned 7 librates, or one-half thereof, to Roger de Powis, and his brother Jonas.1 This continued till the year 1174 inclusive. In 1175, however, 14 librates, being the whole value of the Manor, were similarly assigned to the two brethren. We may therefore set down these favoured Servants of Henry II. as, after Kings and Earls, the first Lords of Wrockwardine. However, their interest here was tem porary, and so I shall postpone a fuller account of their career to a future occasion. In 1176 and 1177 the Sheriff seems to have made good the pay ment of Roger de Powis's share, viz. \u00a37 in each year : but he re tained Jonas de Powis's share in hand, \" because the said Jonas had not as yet brought to the Sheriff the King's Writ,\" authorizing the payment. In 1178 the King acquitted the Sheriff of this arrear of \u00a314, that is, made him a present of it; but another \u00a314, being the whole fiscal value of Wrockwardine for the current year, was made over to Roger de Powis singly. This annnal payment of \u00a314 yearly to Roger de Powis continued till the year 1186 inclu sive; but at Michaelmas 1187 both he and his son, Meredyth, were dead, the latter having been paid \u00a310. 10s. Qd. ofthe current year's value of the Manor, and the balance (\u00a33. 6s. 3d.) being ac counted for by the Sheriff as due to the Crown. We may conclude that Meredyth, son of Roger de Powis, died in July 1187. In 1 188 the Sheriff paid to the Crown \u00a36. 8s. 8d. for the year's issues of Wrockwardine, instead of the ordinary \u00a314 : but the reason of this is not stated. In 1189 the Sheriff similarly paid only \u00a37. 13s. 5c?. ; in 1190, 1191, and 1192, he paid \u00a37 yearly, while \u00a320. 13s. 4c?. had been spent in stocking the Manor. In 1193 and 1194 Wrockwardine may be presumed to have yielded \u00a312 yearly to the Exchequer and \u00a32 to the Canons of Haughmond. 1 In terris datis. \u2014 LEt Rogero de Powis et Jone fratri ejus VII lib. in Wrochewurdin."], [38, "20 WROCKWARDINE. The latter was the proportionate value of Allscot Mill, long before granted to the Canons, but now first alleged in Exchequer accounts as diminishing the ferm of Wrockwardine by \u00a32. In 1195, besides the charge in favour of the Canons, Archbishop Hubert had authorized the Sheriff to bestow 10 librates in Wrockwardine on Meurich, another son of Roger de Powis. This continued in 1196, 1197, 1198, and 1199; but in 1200, only half the said income went to Mewrich de Powis, whilst 6 librates or half a year's value of the whole Manor (exolusive of Allscote Mill) had been bestowed on Hamo le Strange. The fact is, that Meurich de Powis died about May 1200, and nothing in Wrockwardine went to his son Wrenoc. The latter, as I have shown under Worfield, received substantial marks of Royal favour in another quarter.1 Hamo le Strange, who was now for a time Lord of Wrockwar dine, was a younger brother of John le Strange (II.) of Ness and Cheswardine. He had been enfeoffed by King John, whilst Earl of Moreton, in the Leicestershire Manor of Foston. Foston was one of the estates which William Peverel of Nottingham had for feited to King Henry II. , but the Record, which implies that Henry II. enfeoffed Hamo le Strange therein, is erroneous in more than one particular.2 On the accession of King John, his previous grant of Foston to Hamo le Strange did not hold good. Hence in 1199 we find Hamo le Strange fining 40 merks for a reasonable equiva lent in lieu of Foston,3 but he not at length obtaining such ex change, the debt of 40 merks was cancelled on the Pipe- Roll of 1200 by order of the Barons of the Exchequer. In the latter year the above Fine was replaced by one of 60 merks, and which was more specific. It was that the said \" Hamo might have the Manor of Wrocwrthin, late held by Meuric de Powis, with all its stock and implements, until the King should furnish forth, out of his escheats, a fair exchange either for Wrocwrthin or for the land which he had, as Earl, given to Hamo. And when such exchange should have been completed, Wrocwrthin, with its stock, &c, was to revert to the King.\"4 In 1201 and 1202 Hamo le Strange pays instalments on his Fine of 60 merks. In the former year he is entered as entitled to \u00a312, or the full fiscal value of the Manor ; in the latter year he had only had \u00a39. The inference is, that his arrangement about Wrockwar dine expired about June 1202. As Hamo was still alive, we may Supra, Vol. III. pp. 106, 107. Testa de Nevill, p. 88. s *\" Oblata, pp. 14,60.

In the fiscal year which ended at Michaelmas 1203 \u2014 John le Strange (II.) fined 60 merks \"to have custody of Wrockwardine Manor, formerly held by his brother Hamo, till the King should return into England 1 and dispose otherwise thereof.\" Accordingly, in the Pipe-Roll of 1203, the Sheriff discharges Wrockwardine from the Firma Comitatus in the manner following. In terris datis. Et Johanni Extraneo xii lib. in terrd de Wrocumr din quam ipse custodit per breve Regis, de quibus debet respondere.

The same thing followed in the years 1204 and 1205.2 In 1209 John le Strange owed \u00a348 or four years' arrears, but was excused \u00a324 by Writ Royal. Subsequent accounts are not very regular, and for half the year 121 5> and the whole of the years 1216 and 1217 there were no accounts at all. At Michaelmas 1226 John le Strange owed \u00a312 for the current year's ferm of Wrockwardine, and \u00a3163 for arrears. King Henry III. had excused the whole debt, the \u00a312 being ex pressly bestowed on Le Strange \"to support him in the King's service.\"3 Wrockwardine was still however held, subject to the King's pleasure. We are now in a condition to understand what is meant in a Roll of the year 1211, where it is said that \" John le Strange holds the Manor of Wrocwrth'in at ferm, of the Bailiwick (de ballivo) of King John, and is accustomed to pay \u00a312, with the stock ;\"4 \u2014 that is, for the Manor and the stock thereon. In 1227 John le Strange's account of \u00a312 for the year's ferm of Wrockwardine is duly entered. The King returns it in considera tion of the Accountant's \" good and faithful services to King John and to himself.\"5 Moreover by Writ, the King pardons all future favours were conferred by Writs-Close dated at Salop on August 29, 1226 (Claus. II. p. 135). The remittance of arrears was in consideration of \" great services rendered to King John and Henry III., and of Le Strange's large outlay and losses.\" 1 The King was absent from May 1201 to December 1203. 2 A Writ preserved on the Liberate Rolls (page 101) and of date about May 1204, is express as to acquitting John le Strange of all demands made against him for the issues of the Manor of Wrocwur thin. 4 Testa de Nevill, p. 56. 3 Rot.

Such is the evidence of the Pipe-Rolls, but the Charter- Rolls exhibit the affair in quite another aspect. \u2014 John le Strange (II.) had been a public character for more than the 50 years which had transpired since his father's death in 1178. His life-lease of Wrockwardine was therefore of small value when, on May 25, 1231, he obtained the King's Charter granting the Manor to his son, \" John le Estrange, Junior,\" to hold in fee and inherit ance, for a rent of \u00a38, payable at the Exchequer, in lieu of all other services. The Manor was further to be quit of all Tallages.2 This Charter bears date at Wenloc and was attested by Hubert de Burgh, John fitz Alan, Ralph de Mortimer, and others.3 It was not till October 10, 1234, that the Barons of the Exche quer were informed of this grant ; but then at length they are or dered to enrol it.4 Consequently the Pipe-Rolls take no notice of the arrangement till the year ending Michaelmas 1235. Then the Record is accurate in every particular. John le Strange pays \u00a34 as the arrears of last year, and \u00a38 for the ferm of the current year, and is quit. Thereafter the title of John le Strange to hold the Manor in fee, at a rent of \u00a38, is distinctly recognized. The Ac countant discharges his liabilities, and is styled Johannes Extraneus without the addition of Junior. It is nevertheless certain that his father was still living, a matter of which I shall speak elsewhere. In the year 1236 the Sheriff discharges his liabilities in respect of Wrockwardine, setting off \u00a32 as bestowed on the Canons of Haughmond and \u00a312 as bestowed on John le Strange \" ad se sus tentandum.\" The latter entry was mere routine, but correct for all fiscal purposes, for doubtless the Sheriff got nothing from the Manor and was entitled to obliterate its fiscal value in the Corpus Comi tatiis. In a separate schedule, John le Strange accounts \u00a38 for the ferm of Wrockwardine. As the Pipe- Rolls now cease to instruct us 1 Rot. Pip. 11 Henry III., Salop. I do not find any previous Writ, authoriz ing the implied change from a tenure du ring pleasure to a tenure for life. How ever a Writ-Close of May 18, 1228, is to that effect. It gives the Manor to Le Strange for life, and quitclaims all ar- rears of the ferm thereof since he first held it (Claus. 12 Henry III.). 2 From the Table (given Vol. VI. p. 11) it appears that WTrockwardine had not been assessed to any Tallage since 1194-5. 3 Rot.

The chronological his tory of the family of Le Strange must be gathered from other sources. A grant by John le Strange (II.) to Wombridge Priory, I con sider to be nearly cotemporary with a similar grant by Thomas Tuschet, already described.1 The locality alluded to is distant from Wrockwardine, but was associated with that Manor. It is still known as Wrockwardine Wood. If the grant passed, as I suppose, about the year 1220, it was while John le Strange was only Fermor of Wrockwardine. \u2014 As \" John Extraneus, Lord of Knokyn, for the souls' health of himself and King John, he concedes to the Priory all the right he had by reason of his Manor of Wrockwardine, in that land, wood, and pasture, which the illustrious King Henry (Henry II. is meant) did concede to the Priory.\" The land lay, lengthways between Wat lingstreet and Hethegrene, and was bounded, on one side, by the Grantor's bosc contiguous, on the other, by a watercourse running between Stamforde in Watlingstreet and Hethegrene aforesaid. Wilbam de Ercalew, Hugh fitz Robert, Robert fitz Aher, John de Andelawe, and Robert de Brokton attested the Deed.2 John le Strange (III.) undoubtedly became Lord of Wrock wardine in 1231 and in the lifetime of his father. The date of his said father's death may perhaps be deduced from the Originalia-Roll of 1237-8, where the son stipulates \"in the King's presence to satisfy the King touching his Relief, according to the judgment of the King's Court.\" About the year 1231, as I think, \"John le Strange tercius, son of John le Strange, concedes to Wombridge Priory the donation which his Father had made in the bosc of Wombridge. Witnesses, Hugh fitz Robert, William de Hedlege, John de Ondeslawe, Robert de Brokton, and Phibp de Peninton.\"3 A nearly cotemporary Deed exhibits the same grant in another form. \u2014 \"John le Strange tercius, for the souls' health of himself, his wife Lucia, and his father, gives to the Priory all such assarts and boses as it possessed by concession of his Father.

To this Hamo his Father consigned the Manor of Wrock wardine sometime before the year 1255. This was apparently with full license of the Crown, for, though John le Strange continues nominally to account on the Pipe-Roll for the yearly ferm of \u00a38, it is clear that Hamo was the actual Tenant-in-capite and the real Accountant. Hence the Bradford Hundred- Roll of 1255, declares that \" Hamo Extraneus holds the Manor of Wrecwrthin, in-capite of the King, and pays \u00a38 to the Exchequer at London. He does no suit to County or Hundred, and has the King's Charter.\"3 Hamo le Strange's contest with the Abbot of Lilleshull in 1256, has been already recited.4 I need only observe that he stated his title to Wrockwardine to be by feoffment of his Father. I can show no other evidence of Hamo le Stra'nge's seizin than a grant to Wombridge Priory which passed between 1247 and 1259, pro bably about 1252. \u2014 \" Hamo Extraneus with consent of Sir John, his father, grants all his part of the wood of Wombridge which was common to him and Sir Walter de Dunstanville.\" The boundaries of this grant are \" Stamford in Watelyngstret, the Red Sichet, Witestoc, the Thassichos, and so along Watlingstret back to Stam ford.\" \" Whatever within these limits pertained to Wrockwardine Manor was to pass to the Priory.\" Of course the locality was Wrockwardine-Wood.

It is certain that Hamo le Strange accompanied Prince Edward on the Crusade of 1270. I can fix on no more probable period than this for the ascertained fact that the said Hamo gave Wrockwardine to his younger brother, \u2014 Robert le Strange, who like himself went to Palestine. The elder brother perished in the expedition ; the younger barely survived it. The transfer from the former to the latter was apparently im pugned as unlawful, for, in the year 1273, the Sheriff is ordered to seize Stretton, Ellesmere, and Wrockwardine, into the King's-hand ; aud of Stretton it is particularly stated that the reason of the seizure was because Hamo le Strange, being Tenant-in-capite thereof, had alienated it without license.1 In 1275, Wrockwardine, Stretton, and Ellesmere, were committed to the custody of Bogo de Knovill,2 but in the same year the King accepted the homage of Robert le Strange for Wrockwardine, \" as that which Hamo le Strange had formerly given to the said Robert by Charter.\" Robert is hence forth to hold the Manor, in-capite, by service of one-twentieth of a Knight's-fee.3 Concurrently with this, Robert le Strange obtained the following Quitclaim from John le Strange (IV.), the elder brother of himself and Hamo. \u2014 \"John le Strange Lord of Knokyn gives by spontaneous will, concedes, licenses, and quitclaims, for himself and heirs, all right in Wrocwardin Manor, to Robert le Strange his brother, who is to do homage to the King therefore.

A nearly cotemporary Tenure-Roll repeats this statement, and gives the members of Wrockwardine as Admaston, Aldescote (Allscot), Ley ton (Leaton), Burcote, Nesse, Clotley, and Walcott. This statement is inaccu rate as regards Walcott, which was a member both of the Manor and Parish of Wellington. \" With these exceptions,\" says the Re cord, \" John le Strange holds the whole Manor in demesne, main taining there his free-Court, with its pleas of bloodshed, and hue and cry, and gallows ; \u2014 all which franchises he uses.\" On June 18, 1289, the King's writ of Diem clausit announced the death of John, son of Robert le Strange.1 His heir was found to be his next brother, viz., \u2014 Fulk le Strange, who, according to one Inquest, was 21, ac cording to another, 22 years of age at the time of his brother's death. Of this Fulk I have said much already as Lord of Sutton Mad dock, Corfham, and Longnor.2 At the Assizes of 1292, the Brad ford Jurors presented him as of full age and yet not a Knight, also as claiming Free-Warren, Free-Court, gallows, and the Assize of bread and beer in Wrocwrthyn. They also remembered Hamo le Strange's tenure of the Manor by a Fee-farm rent of \u00a38, and stated its full value to be \u00a318. Fulco le Strange was, as a matter of course, prosecuted under a Writ of Quo Waranto for the exercise of his Franchises in Wrockwardine. He claimed them all, as appur tenant to the Manor, and as having been exercised by Henry III. and his predecessors. He recited how Henry III. had granted the Manor with all its franchises and free customs to his Ancestor, John le Strange, and his heirs. He stated himself to be heir of the said John le Strange. The Crown Lawyer might have shown the falsity of this last assertion, but he adopted the routine argu ment, viz. that Infangethef and two free-Courts were not expressly conveyed in Henry III.'s Charter, and that Ways and Warren were distinct things of themselves, and no appurtenances of any Manor, and not separable from the Crown without special grant.3 The cause was adjourned, and I lose the result ; but I think that the decision, as to Free- Warren at least, must have been in favour of the Crown. 1 Inquisitions, 17 Edw.

In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, Fulco Extraneus is duly en tered as Lord of Wrockwardine. The Writ of Diem clausit on his death is dated January 23, 1324. An Inquest held at Shrewsbury on July 12, found him to have held Wrocworthin in-capite, for one twentieth of a knight's-fee, and by payment of \u00a38 rent through the Sheriff. John his son and heir was found to have attained the age of 18 years on January 25, 1324.1 I may here add that in 1333 this John le Strange obtained a Charter of Free-Warren in his demesnes at Wrockwardine. The Wombridge Chartulary supplies two Deeds illustrative of Fulk le Strange's connection with Wrockwardine, \u2014 Between the years 1289 and 1296, as Lord thereof, he enfeoffs Henry son of Hamund de Wodhouse in a parcel of land in his wood of Russhemore, for 40s. paid, and 2s. rent. Witnesses, Master John de Cherleton, Rector of the Church of Wrocwardyn, John de Appley, William de Erleton, John fitz Ralph of Wrocwardyn, and John de Ley ton. On January 25, 1305, he enfeoffs the same Henry and his wife Amice, for 60s. paid and 2s. rent, in a parcel of land in his Wood of Wrocwardyn, extending from the Wood of Lyleshul to the watercourse of Russhemere. He further concedes 2 acres in the Wood of Wrockwardyn, between Hauckehurstbrok and the Hun deshoc, at a further rent of 2s., and reserving suit to his two great Courts, half-yearly. Witnesses, Master John de Chorleton, Peter de Eyton, Pagan de Preston, ***** de Erleton, Richard de Mokeleston, &c. It is evident that Wrockwardine-Wood was the locality of both these grants. WROCKWARDINE CHURCH. This was a Saxon Foundation, and the Mother-Church of a dis trict. Earl Roger in his Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey grants thereto the Church of Worgordina, and confirms one hide in Chor leton which Oilerius the Priest had given to the Abbey. These gifts I take to be the Church and Hide mentioned in Domesday as held by St. Peter, that is by Shrewsbury Abbey. The Confirmation of William Rufus to that House includes the Church of Werecordin. The Confirmations of Henry I., Stephen, and Henry IT., include both the Church and the Hide of land. Earl Hugh's suspected Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey conveys the tithes of his demesne of Worocordin ; but his less suspected 1 Inquisitions, 17 Edw. IL, No. 73."], [46, "28 WROCKWARDINE. Charter is more credible in this very particular, viz. that it gives but two-thirds of the said tithes. Roger (de Clinton), Bishop of Coventry, inspected and confirmed some Charter of Earl Hugh, conveying two-thirds of the tithes of his demesnes of Wrockwardine to Shrewsbury Abbey.1 The same Roger, calling himself Bishop of Chester, confirmed the Abbey in its possession of the Church of Wrockwardine \" with its Chapels,\" and an annual pension of 20s. receivable therefrom.2 Bishop Walter Durdent similarly confirmed \" the Church of Worocwordin with the tithe of the vill, and with the chapels per taining thereto.\" Bishop Richard Peche similarly confirmed two thirds of the demesne tithes of Wrockwardine, and a pension of 20s. from the Church. Other Confirmations, Archiepiscopal and Dio cesan, are in consonance with the above. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Wrocworthin, in the Deanery of Salop, at \u00a310 per annum; but says nothing about a Pension.3 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth quoted the above Taxation, but reduced the current tax to 10 merks. The reasons were, \u2014 be cause the Rector of Wrocwarthin had a carucate of land, and rents in the Parish, which were not assessable to the Ninth (though they served to swell the Taxation). Also there were few sheep in the Parish because of an insufficiency of sheep-pasture.4 Meanwhile, a Patent of Edward III., dated July 26, 1329, had given license for the Abbot of Shrewsbury to appropriate this Church.5 I find no Record as to how this was done, either in the Lichfield Registers or the Salop Chartulary ; but the first Vicar of Wrockwardine was instituted in 1341. A Rent- Roll of Salop Abbey (about 1490) values the Rectorial tithes of Wrokewardyn at \u00a317. 6s. 8c?. The Valor of 1534-5 re duces this to \u00a314 ;6 and values the Vicarage of Wrockwardyn, then held by William Butler, at \u00a38 per annum, less 7s. Qd. for procurations and 4s. for synodals.7 The Abbot of Shrewsbury, it appears, paid out of his Rectorial receipts an annuity of 33s. 4c?. to Thomas Freer, Dean of the Church of Rocordyn.8 This was by ordinance of the Bishop who first allowed the appropriation. The Annuitant, alluded to, was probably the Rural Dean of the Deanery of Salop. 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 325. \u2022- Harl. MS. 3868, fo. 7, b. 3 Pope Nich. Taxation, p. 247. 4 Inquis.

Oilerius, the Priest, who gave a hide in Cherlton to Shrewsbury Abbey, was, I take it, Rector of Wrockwardine. We may further identify him with \" Odelirius of Orleans, son of Constantius ; \u2014 one of the three wise Clerks, whose society was much affected by Earl Roger, and by whose counsels he was advantageously guided.\" Odelirius was also Incumbent of that Wooden Chapel in the East- Foregate of Shrewsbury, which made way, by his cession, for the magnificent Abbey of St. Peter; a foundation to which Odelirius contributed not a little. He gave thereto not only his estate at Cherlton and his bving at Shrewsbury ; but he lent all the efficacy of his oratory to persuade the Earl to the undertaking ; he paid \u00a315 sterling when the buildings were commenced; and he cove nanted to consign half his fortune with his son Benedict, when the latter should become a Monk of the House.1 He had two other sons, viz. Ebrard, for whom he purposed the other half of his for tune, and Ordericus, the Historian. \u2014 So much for the clerical celi bacy of the period. Odelirius, after his Patron's death (an event which according to this passage of Ordericus must have taken place as early as July 27, 1092),2 became himself a Monk of Shrewsbury. In this capacity he lived seven years, and, if his Son's account be verbally correct, died on Friday, June 3, 1099. Master John de Cherleton is a very frequent witness of local Deeds, the earliest of which I should date about 1260. Be fore 1296 he styles himself Rector of the Church of Wrockwardine, and occurs as such in February 1309 and in May 1320. He had a daughter, as we have seen, espoused about 1275 to Richard le Bere of Muxton.3 John was the name of the Rector of Wrockwardine on June 8, 1332,' when the Bishop makes him Penitentiary for the Archdea conry of Salop. He is said to have been still here in 16 Edward III., 1342-3,4 but this hardly seems consistent with what follows. Adam de Hetheye, Deacon, first Vicar of Wrockwardine, was instituted May 21, 1341,5 at the presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Salop. On Sept. 22, 1349, he exchanged preferment with \u2014 1 The covenant was fulfilled apparently by a gift of \u00a3200 sterling ;\u2014 an enormous sum at that period.

I suppose that the following places nearly corresponded with the seven-and-a-half Berewicks which are assigned in Domesday to Wrockwardine. \u2014 Charlton, Admaston, Allscot, Burcot, Leaton, Clotley, and a place called Nesse, were at a later period members of Wrockwardine. As to Charlton, the hide there, which Oilerius gave to Shrews bury Abbey, must not be taken for the whole township. The Shrewsbury Churches of St. Mary and St. Julian had at a later period a distinct estate at Charlton ; and I think it very probable that it was bestowed on those Churches by the same Oilerius, within thirteen years after Domesday. I will first speak distinctively of the two estates into which Charlton was thus divided, and after wards say something on the early history of that great family which drew its name and origin from this locality. Shrewsbury Abbey Fee. Between the years 1175 and 1190 Radulf de Cherl' (Cherlton I presume) attests an agreement be tween Ralph Abbot of Shrewsbury and Walter de Dunstanvill. Between the years 1227 and 1241, Richard, son of Phibp de Cherl ton, attests an Uppington Deed, and in 1246 Walter de Cherlton sat on an Uppington Jury. These two persons, I think, occur again in the following transactions. Tn November 1248 Richard de Cherlton sued Walter le Peleter of Cherlton, under writ of mort d'ancestre for two-thirds of a half-virgate in Cherlton. Walter sur rendered the premises. Soon afterwards Richard de Cherlton dis seized the same Walter of 6 acres in Cherlton, alleging that they were part (de corpore) of the said half-virgate. For this Walter prosecuted him at the Assizes of 1256, proving that his own Mother 1 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 264. 2 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 220."], [51, "31 CHARLTON. had held the said 6 acres at the time of the Trial of 1248 and for long after, till they came to himself by hereditary right, so that he held them peacefully for a wjhple year. The Jury found for Walter.1 About the year 1274 Richard de Cherleton grants to Richard de Soggedon, Clerk, all his land of Cherleton, with houses, curtilages, rents, homages, &c. for service of one rose-blossom payable yearly, on the Nativity of St. John Baptist, at the Grantor's House of Cherleton. Witnesses, Sir John de Erkelewe, Robert de Stanton, Phibp de Pevinton, Henry de Rodinton.2 It would seem that this deed was contemplative of a surrender to Shrewsbury Abbey ; for in a subsequent Deed Richard de Sugge don, Clerk, grants the identical premises to the Abbey, with the addition of certain land near his garden \" which he had of WilHam Skinner's land.\"3 The witnesses of this Deed are not given ; and perhaps it was inoperative. About the year 1280, Richard de Soggedon for the souls'-hcalth of himself and Alia his wife gave, for the sustenance of two wax candles before the Altar of the Virgin, in Hagmon Abbey, a mes suage and 4^ acres in Cherleton. Witnesses, Master John de Cherleton, Ralph de Cherleton, Richard de Bury, John de Appele, Henry de Rodinton.* We have seen one Robert de Cherlton attesting Uppington Deeds from about 1220 to 1265. He further appears on Juries of 1243, 1246, 1249, 1253, 1259, 1260, and 1262.6 It is doubtful whether he was not the same person with one who in several instances is called \" Robert son of William de Cherlton.\"6 He left as it seems two sons. \u2014 About the year 1280 Richard son of Robert de Cherleton gives to Robert his brother, certain rents in Aston (under Wrekin) which were clearly held of Shrewsbury Abbey. He also gives him a cer tain meadow (called Radulph's meadow) in the field of Cherleton, towards Ukiton.1 This too I conceive to have been held of Shrews bury Abbey, but I infer that the Grantor was a different person from the Richard de Cherlton of 1248-1274, whose Deed above quoted, must have divested him of all interest in Charlton.

This Robert was probably the father of John de Cherlton of Powis, of Alan de Cherlton of Apley, and of Thomas de Cherlton, Bishop of Hereford. Certain at least it is that John de Cherlton succeeded to the tenancy under Shrewsbury Abbey and built Charl ton Castle thereon. In what I shall now say of this illustrious personage I shall be specially careful to trace his history as a Tenant of Shrewsbury Abbey. One document of the year 1306 names him, while as yet he was not a knight, and before his future Patron, King Edward IL, had ascended the throne. \"William Fraunceys of Cherleton concedes to Richard Berne houd of Cherleton an acre in the fields towards Walcote, upon Sun domehull, to hold from Michaelmas 1306, till six crops should have been taken therefrom.\" The premises were bounded by lands of John de Cherleton and Michael de Laueley. \" The Grantor also concedes another acre towards La Lee, for three crops, at a rent of one Rose. Witnesses, Adam Bernehoud, Alan le Pokere, John de Pyrhull, Robert fitz Roger, and Adam Pyrum.\"2 The next deed, dated at Cherleton on Wednesday, Sept. 18, 1308, marks well the growing importance of John de Cherleton. \u2014 \" Wilbam Fraunceis of Cherleton gives to Roger le Monck of Salop and Juliana his wife, for a sum of money, one messuage, to gether with all his land of Cherleton, to hold of the Lords of the Fee.\" The messuage is described as lying between the land of Sir John de Cherleton, Knight, and the tenement which belonged to the Church of St. Mary, Salop.

On June 25, 1309, Griffin ap Owen, Prince of Powis, was deceased, without issue ; and on Aug. 26, John de Cherlton, having by license and gift of the King, married Hawyse, sister and heir of the said Griffin, had livery of the Barony of Pole, saving the dower of Ela, widow of the de ceased Griffin.2 In February 1309, that is before his greater eleva tion, we find John de Cherlton, though resident at Dublin, pur chasing land at Haughton near Shiffnal. In August of the same year his estate at Haughton is increased or secured by a second Deed; and on September 15 following, being at Shrewsbury, he entails his Haughton purchase on his brother Alan and his bodily heirs, with remainder to himself and his heirs.3 On November 17, 1316, John de Cherlton is empowered by Patent to crenellate, or embattle, and to surround with a stone wall, his mansion at Cherl ton. On Sept. 14, 1325, another Patent enables him to fortify his house at Shrewsbury4 with battlements and a wall of stone. In 1337, being appointed Justice of Ireland, he landed there on Tues day, October 14, accompanied by his brother Thomas. The latter having been previously a Canon of York, Archdeacon of Wells and Northumberland, and King's Treasurer, had been consecrated Bishop of Hereford on Oct. 18, 1327, and was now Chancellor of Ireland. He died on January 11, 1344, and was buried in Here ford Cathedral. The Inquest on the death of John de Cherleton himself was or dered by Writ of December 24, 1353, and was held at Welsh Pool on January 3, 1354. By a Fine, previously levied, the lands and tenements which he had held at Cherleton, under the Abbot of Shrewsbury by service of 6s. 8c?. per annum, were his for life only ; that is, he had entailed them. They consisted of a carucate of poor land, and of a messuage which was worth nothing beyond its ex penses.6 Such was the description of Charlton Castle, before it had stood forty years.

I now follow to its conclusion the history of the Abbot of Shrews bury's seigneury over the Barons of Powis, in respect of Charlton. \u2014 A Rent-Roll of Shrewsbury Abbey, about 1490, gives only two items of receipt from Charlton, amounting to 2s. It also gives 13s. 4c?. as received from one Dycher \"for the ferme at Recarden,\" but I doubt what Abbatial estate was thus alluded to. The Valor of 1534 declares the Abbot's receipts from Chorleton to be \u00a32. 4s. 4-d. However an Account of the Assets of the Dis solved Abbey names only 19s. receipts, viz. 17s. from lands in Chorleton, and 2s. for the \" free rent of the Lord Powis for lands in Chorleton.\" So then the Baron Grey de Powis was Tenant of the Abbot of Shrewsbury's land, just as his Ancestors the Barons Cherlton of Powis had been two centuries before, though the ser vices were altered from 6s. 8d. to 2s. St. Mary's and St. Julian's Fee. We have seen that William de Cherlton, alias William de la Curt, alias William de Buri, alias William de Uppington, who died in 1243, held one virgate in Cherlton of the Church of St. Mary, and at a rent of Is.4 I have traced both his Ancestors and Descendants under Uppington.

Two cotemporaries of the name of Cherlton here deserve a brief notice, viz. \u2014 (1) Alan son of Yvo de Cherlton who occurs as a witness from about 1241 to about 1253, and as a Juror in 1243 and 1246. About the year 1245, Alan son of Yvo de Cherlton gives to Hamo de Alderis cot (late Servant of Master John Bacon), for his homage and ser vice and for 18s. paid, 4 acres of his land in that field of Cherlton towards Uppington, which is called Hauckershull, of which the first acre lies between Uppington Chapel and Charlton, and the fourth lies near to Watling street, to the North thereof and extends to wards Uckington. Rent one penny. Witnesses, Sir Hugh fitz Ro bert, Knight, Wilbam de Erkalewe, knight, Robert de Cherleton.1 (2) John Clerk, or John Clerk of Cherlton, attests Deeds in and shortly before the year 1241, and in 1248 is called John de Cherl ton.2 It is this person, I presume, who occurs on the Assize- Roll of 1272 as John son of Adam de Cherlton and as Replevyer on be half of one Stephen de Rushton. This would make him of the Uppington branch. One of the above two persons, as I should sup pose, was father of that Master John de Cherlton, whom I have put down in my bst of Rectors of Wrockwardine as living from 1260 to 1320. I have something now to add about Master John de Cherl ton in his lay capacity. In Michaelmas Term 1266 and Hilary Term 1267, Matilda, widow of Madoc de Milnehethe was suing John de Cherlton for half a vfrgate in Cherlton, which she claimed as her right. The re sult does not appear. At the Assizes of 1272, Petronilla, widow of Robert de Day, neg lected to prosecute a suit de ingressu against John the Clerk (John de Cherlton, I presume), and Robert de Horsleg, concerning a tene ment in Cherlton. Her Surety was Thomas le Hore of Aston. The Feodary of 1284, says that Master John de Cherlton holds the vill of Cherleton under the Churches of St. Mary and St. Julian at Shrewsbury, Chapels of the King, and pays 16s. per annum in lieu of all services. The nearly cotemporary Tenure-Roll of Brad ford Hundred3 repeats the statement, almost verbatim. In 1309, we have Master John de Cherlton acting as Attorney for Sir John de Cherlton (of Powys), in respect of a purchase at Haughton.4 In November 1316, Master John de Cherlton appears with Wombridge Chart., Upinton, No. i.

This abatement was allowed at the Exchequer without comment, then or afterwards. So Wrockwardine remained as a Manor of \u00a312 reputed fiscal value, instead of \u00a314 as before. It will be observed that below Allscot-Mill the Manor of Isombridge abuts on the Western bank of the River Tern. The Haghmon Canons had, pre vious to obtaining Allscot Mill, got the Fishery of Isombridge from William fitz Ulger.1 Hugh fitz Robert (William fitz Ulger's grand son) quitclaimed the gift of his said Grandfather, calling it the \" Fishery of Retheresford.\" The said Hugh, for a sum of 8 merks, further empowered the Canons of Haghmon to make good all breaches or fractures then or afterwards existing, in his land along his bank of Time, as the said bank extended from the \" old fishery of Retheresforde to Aldredescote Mill.\"2 About the year 1235, the Abbot of Haghmon gives to the Church of Wrockwardine 4 acres pertaining to Allscot-Mill held by Radulf the Provost. The Rector of Wrockwardine in return empowers the Abbot to take turves and soil from Gretholers Moor, to repair the stank of Allscot-Mill.\"3 The Taxation of 1291, values the Abbot of Haghmon's Mill of Alderescote at 4s. per annum. In subsequent Valuations, this item is probably included in the Abbot's receipts from Walcot. It would seem that Master John Bacon was at one time a Feoffee in Allscot. A Wombridge Charter, already set forth, speaks of one Hamo as being then a \" Client of Master John Bacon at Aldres cote.\"4 This was about 1238. The same Hamo is in other Deeds, earlier than, or passing in, 1241, caUed merely Serviens or Cliens of Master John Bacon. I know nothing more of John Bacon than what belongs to a period long antecedent. In July 1221, being called \" Clerk of the Lord Legate \" (some Papal Legate, I pre sume), he was Custos of the lands of Shrewsbury Abbey during a vacancy.5 His servant or Client at Allscot was perhaps a sort of Steward. He was a frequent Grantee of lands in Uppington, but such grants as seem to be later than 1241, speak of him either as \" formerly servant of John Bacon,\" or else as Hamo de Aldrescote. In 1249, as \" Hamo de Aldreschot,\" he officiated on a local Jury. About the year 1262, as Hamund de Alderescote he conveyed all his acquisi tions in Uppington to Wombridge Priory, viz. three nokes, which he \" Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 169. 5 Hot. Claus. 5 Hen.

Whether William fitz Alan's recognition of Wombridge Priory be as early as 1138 or as late as 1160, it is attested by William Burnel,2 whose connection with the matter I cannot account for, unless he had some local interest. Any feoffment in Wrockwardine previous to 1155, would not appear on the Pipe-Rolls. Again, I cannot account for a later William Burnel being assessed in 1209, under \" Regard of the Forest of Mount Gil bert,\"3 unless he had land at Admaston. We see Sir Hugh Burnel attesting a Deed of Robert le Strange's at least as early as 1275-6.4 In the Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1285) Hugh Burnell is said to hold certain rents (the amount left blank) in Admaston, a mem ber of Wrockwardine. Sir Hugh Burnell, brother of the Chan cellor, and father ofthe Chancellor's heir, Philip, died in 1286, and the Escheator-citra-Trent was duly ordered to seize his lands.5 I do not find any Inquest taken on his death. At the Assizes of 1292, the Bradford Jurors presented Sibil Burnel (his widow) for non-attendance.6 They also presented how Sibil Burnel held 100s. rent in Ademonston, which was a member of the once Royal Manor of Wrocwardyn. To this Sibil appeared, and stated that she held nothing, save by will of Philip Burnel (her son), whose free tene ment was thus in question. Philip (thus called to warranty) further called Nicholas de Gamages of Gloucestershire. He was to produce the said Nicholas at Lichfield in January 1293; but the Sheriff of Gloucestershire neglected his duty, and the cause was again ad journed.7 I neither know the result nor can I divine what Nicholas de Gamages can have had to do with the matter, except perhaps as a Trustee. 1 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

I can say nothing further of the Burnel interest in Admaston.1 CLOTLEY, now CLUDDLEY. The first tenant of this member of Wrockwardine was perhaps Walter de Clotley, who has been seen to attest a Tibberton Deed between 1175 and 1180. At the Assizes of 1203, Richard fitz Ralph and Alan de Clotley accorded a previous dispute. Alan was to take down a fence which he had erected to the injury of Richard fitz Ralph's tenement in Clotley. He was also to become Richard's tenant (homo) in respect of half a virgate of land and to pay him 10s. For leave to make this agreement Alan fined half a merk, his Surety being Walter de Witefeld.2 From this we may venture to put down Richard fitz Ralph as second known Lord of Clotley. Of Henry de Clotley, occurring about 1237, of his probable iden tity with Henry de Burton, and of his daughter Felicia I have spoken under Uppington.3 His tenure in Clotley was not, I think, the principal one, for cotemporary with him was one Robert de Clotley. This Robert attests a Charter of John le Strange about 1235, and occurs as a Juror or a witness from thence till about 1250, but spe cifically in 1243 and 1249. After Robert, one Ralph de Clotley oc curs, viz. on Juries of 1256 and 1260. John de Clotley was Juror on a Rodington Inquest in January 1274. The Tenure- Roll of 1285 brings up another Ralph de Clotley, fully stated to be holding Clotley, a member of Wrockwardine, under John le Strange. Ralph was bving in 1300. The tenement which the Erletons held in Clotley has been no ticed elsewhere.4 It was under the Church of Wroxeter, not under the Lords of Wrockwardine. On this exceptional matter I have no further evidence. Nor yet can I tell how Shrewsbury Abbey ob tained any footing in Clotley ; but in the Rent-Roll of 1490, a rent of Qd. was receivable by the Abbey from Mayster Clode (Mr. Cludde) for something in Clotleyn.i 1 The Inquisition of 22 Edw.

While Earl Roger seized upon Wrockwardine as a demesne-manor of the Saxon Kings, he also appropriated Wellington and High Er call as demesne-manors of the Saxon Earls.

In demesne are vi ox-teams ; and xn Neat-herds, xn Villains, and vm Boors, with a Priest, have ix Teams ; and there might be other ix Teams. Here is a Mill of 12s. (annual value) and two Fisheries of 8s. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth \u00a320 (per annum). Now it is worth \u00a318.\"** The earliest severance of any member of Wellington was that of Dawley, presumed to have been one of its Saxon Berewicks, but given by Earl Roger himself to William Pantulf. This took place before Domesday, and is certified in that Record, as we have already seen, when treating of Dawley as a distinct Manor.2 The next alienation was that of three carucates of land at Walcot and of Walcot Mill to Haughmond Abbey. This was in or before 1141, the Rival Donors being the Empress Maud and King Stephen. The next, or rather a cotemporary, alienation, was also by the Empress, who about 1141 gave Aston, a member of Welbngton, to Shrewsbury Abbey. Henry II. , while yet only a claimant of the Crown, gave 7 librates of land in \" his Manor of Wellington \" to Hamo le Strange, but, as we shall see under Cheswardine, the grant was commuted at the Restoration. Hence Wellington came to the hands of Henry II. as a Manor of Royal Demesne whose gross fiscal value was \u00a313. Ils. 4c?. per annum, but whose net value was \u00a36. Ils. 4d. in consequence of his instant recognition of the Abbot of Haughmond's claim to Walcot (valued at \u00a33. Ils. 4c?.), and of the Abbot of Shrewsbury's claim to Aston (valued at \u00a33. 8s. 8c?.). In the year 1167, Henry IL, after eleven years' acquiescence, seems to have disallowed the alienation of Aston, but in 1190 in consequence of a different view taken by Richard I., the Abbot of Shrewsbury re gained the vill ; but its fiscal value was thenceforth put at \u00a33 only.

It remained a Manor of \u00a37 net annual value. Meanwhile, for the quarter ending Michaelmas 1177, the Sheriff was ordered by Writ Royal to assign lands, less ening by a sum of \u00a34 the revenues of Wellington and Edgmond, to Simon fitz Simon, who was Custos of Stretton Castle. The full allowance of \u00a316 per annum was made out to the same person from 1178 to 1189 inclusive. Then his tenure ceased. During the twelve years in which he was thus interested in Wel lington, Symon fitz Symon appears to have had the power of grant ing sub-feoffments. One such is preserved in the Shrewsbury Chartulary. He gives to Thomas fitz Geoffrey and his heirs, for their service and for a rent of 6s., a virgate in the vill of Beitune sub Wreken.1 Witnesses, Robert, Monk ; John fitz Symon ; Walter de Meintone; Walter de Appel'; Walter fitz Hugh; William Wyard ; Hemming de Dotrel (probably Dothill) ; Heyluiet de Eston ; Wilbam de Herdulveston (Arleston) ; John de Appel' ; Richard, Priest ; Philip de Welintone ; and Master Ralph de Mal bng, \" who wrote this Charter.\"2 On the Forest-Roll of 1180, Simon fitz Simon stands assessed at 13s. for imbladements, viz. 10 acres of wheat and 6 acres of oats (in the Forest of Mount Gilbert probably). Simon fitz Simon, Castellan of Stretton, seems to have left Welbngton and Edgmond somewhat impoverished in respect of manorial stock. In the years ending Michaelmas 1190 and 1191, and in the half-year ending Easter 1192, the Sheriff accounted for the ferm of those Manors in a way which shows that they realized 50s. per annum less than they ought. This was from the default of their stock, as left by Simon fitz Simon.3 But about Easter 1192, 20 librates of land in Stretton, Edgmond, and Wellington were assigned to William fitz Simon and James his brother, by Writ Royal. They were, I suppose, sons of Simon fitz Simon. They received a reputed income of \u00a340 in this way, for the King's order was suspended after Easter 1194. \u2014 Then Wian son of Jonas de Powis had the King's mandate for 7 librates of land, in Welbngton only. He thus received \u00a33. 10s. in 1194, \u00a37 in each of the years 1195, 1196, and 1197, and \u00a33. 10s. for the half-year ending Easter 1198. At Michaelmas 1198, the Sheriff again claims a deduction of 50s. for default of stock at Wellington and Edgmond. The accounts of 1198 are repeated in 1 This till is now lost.

This continued till 1209 inclusive; but in 1210 only eight months' proportion of such revenue (viz. \u00a34. 13s. 4c?.) is assigned to Wion fitz Jonas, whose interest therefore ceased in May 1210. Meantime, that is in 1204, I find Wianus. Walensis (as he is called) assessed 6 merks to the fifth Scutage of King John. His liability doubtless arose from his tenure-in-capite at Wellington. Of him, as sometime Lord of Overton (Fbntshire), I shall have to say more when I come to the history of the Borders. About Midsummer 1210 Thomas de Erdington appears to have obtained a fee-farm grant of Wellington from King John. About Midsummer 1211 the fee-farm grant was changed into a more absolute one, viz. to support the Grantee in the King's service. Hence at Michaelmas 1212 the Sheriff holds Thomas de Erdington responsible for that \u00a37 which was the year's fiscal value of the Manor whilst the said Thomas held it in fee-farm (de ballivo Eegis) ; but as to the \u00a38. 15s., or fifteen months' revenue which had still to be accounted for, he writes off that sum as absolutely given to Erdington and no longer chargeable on himself. He certifies further that the whole fiscal value of Wellington (\u00a37) was hence forth to be similarly made over to Erdington, according to a gift and charter of the King. This is minutely consistent with a Roll of Shropshire Tenures which I have always quoted as having been returnable on June 25, 1211. The entry now pertinent is \u2014 Thomas de Erdinton tenet manerium de Welinton de Ballivo do mini Regis Johannis et solet reddere ad scaccarium \u00a37.1 In other words, the entry was made just before that period when the Pipe- Rolls teach us that Erdington' s responsibility to the Exchequer was waived by the King. Another point of comparative dates is not so satisfactory. King John's second Charter to Erdington is extant, but it bears date, not before Michaelmas 1212 (as the Pipe- Roll would lead us to expect), but on November 3, 1212. The inference is either that the Pipe- Rolls, though they contain monetary accounts down to Michaelmas, were sometimes made up at a later date, or else that King John expedited two Charters to Erdington, the latest of which only is enrolled. The Charter, such as we have it, gives Webnton to Er- 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 56."], [63, "43 WELLINGTON. dinton and his heirs, to hold in capite by service of a knight's fee ; also Saghebiry (Shawbury),\u2014 to hold by a like service; with all franchises and free customs.1 After this we ordinarily find Wellington discharged from the Corpus Comitattis, as seven librates of land, for which the Sheriff was no longer accountable ; but I think Egidius de Erdinton (son and heir of Thomas) is first written as the recipient in 1229. It is further observable that Wellington was assessed to no King's-tallage after 1199.2 This may be partly explained by what has been said above ; but I cannot explain why Erdinton and his successors, as Tenants in capite of Wellington and Shawbury, were never assessed to scutages proportionate to two knights'-fees.3 At the Assizes of 1221 a curious cause was heard. Elena, daughter of Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, had obtained possession of Wellington, alleging a gift of the Manor by a certain Wyandus (Wian fitz Jonas is meant), to whom the King (Henry III.) and his Council had committed it. Now Giles de Erdinton, though a Minor, sued Elena for the Manor under Writ of mort d'ancestre, viz. as heir of his father, Thomas. Ostricius, Lewellyn's Clerk, defended Elena's title as above, and called the King's Council to warranty. To this Giles de Erdinton rejoined, that Wyandus had never had seizin of the Manor since Thomas de Erdinton's death (in 1218). The case was adjourned, till the Justiciars should confer with the King and his Council, in Hilary Term at Westminster.4 I have further notices of this Suit in Trinity Term 1222 when Peter de Eyton was the only Recognizor in attendance ; \u2014 in Michaelmas Term 1224, when Elen ap Lewellyn and her husband (John de Stok) are associated as Defendants ; \u2014 in Hilary, Trinity, and Michaelmas Terms 1225, when the cause was again adjourned; \u2014 and in Easter Term 1226, when it was sent back to the Country for the adjudication of Justices Itinerant, who were to determine it, whether Elena appeared or not, she having made repeated de faults. On this last occasion Thomas de Constantine and Peter de Eyton were the only Recognizors who appeared at Westminster. There can be no doubt that Giles de Erdinton obtained recognition of his rights before 1229, and probably on the true ground, viz. that Wian de Powis's seizin was an old affair, long since obliterated by the feoffment of Thomas de Erdinton, who had undoubtedly died in possession of the Manor. 3 Vide supra, Vol. VIII. p. 241. 4 Assize-Roll, 6 Hon.

In 1244 (as we have seen under Shawbury \u25a0-) Giles de Erdinton obtained a Charter for a Fair and Market at Wellington. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 speaks as foUows of Well ington. \u2014 \" Egidius de Herdinton holds Wellinton with its appurte nances ; \u2014 a free Manor, which King John gave to Thomas de Herdinton, father of the said Egidius, to hold as freely as the King held it, and by the aforesaid service (alluding to the Knight's-fee by which Shawbury and Wellington had in the previous sentence been stated to be held). And the said Egidius is wont to have husbote and haybote de husseto (Query, deforestd?), by debvery of the Seneschal, but the Jurors knew not by what warranty. And his (Egidius's) Seneschal comes twice a year, at the Sheriff's Tourn, to the Hundred Court, and (there) demands (to hold) his own free Court. And the same Egidius has Market and Fair at Welinton by Royal Charter.\"2 How Sir Hugh Burnel acquired Wellington from Giles de Er dinton, I have never been able to discover. On June 1, 1283, the said Sir Hugh obtained a Charter, enabling him to hold a market here on Thursdays, and two annual Fairs on the vigil, day, and morrow of St. Barnabas (June 10, 11, and 12), and the vigil, day, and morrow of the Decollation of John Baptist (August 28, 29, and 30) .3 It will be observed that this Charter was partly in re newal, partly in augmentation, of that previously obtained by Erdinton. I infer that an Assignee or Purchaser, such as I take Burnel to have been, was not legally entitled to avail himself of privileges granted merely to Erdinton and his heirs. However, in some later cases of Quo Waranto, the Crown Lawyers did not suc ceed in establishing such a distinction. On April 8 and May 12, 1284, an Inquest was ordered and held, as to Hugh Burnell's right to take oak-timber, and as to the right of his Tenants at Wellington and Ardelfeston (Arleston) to take estovers and common pasture, from and in the Haye of Wellington.4 The Jurors found that Thomas de Erdinton, King John's Grantee, as well as his men, had enjoyed the privileges in question. They added a piece of history not elsewhere, as I think, related, viz. that John gave Wellington to Erdinton in reward for the services ren dered by tite latter in the Court of Rome at the time of the Inter dict. The Jurors further pointed out that Roger de Clifford, Jus tice of the Forest, was the first who had abridged these franchises, Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 142. Rot. Hundred. II. 56. 3 Rot. Chart. 11 Edw.

Finally the Jurors notified that, at the time of King John's gift, there were only 14 hearths in Welling ton and 24 hearths in Ardelfeston. So then in John's reign Arleston, the member, was a more popu lous place than Wellington, the caput. The increase in one of the two, or both places, but probably in Wellington, within a century, is impbed by the very nature of the Jurors' remark. It is singular that the Feodaries of 1284-5 take no notice of Wellington. On Hugh Burnell's death in 1286 Wellington and Eudon Burnell were assigned as the dower of his widow, Sibil. In the year 1305-6 I find both Manors in the Escheator's hands, be cause Sibil Burnel was dead, and Edward, her grandson and heir, was in ward to the Crown. The year's revenue of the two Manors was \u00a330.x I suppose that Philip Burnel's Widow had in turn her dower in Wellington ; for Edward Burnel at his death in 1315 was seized of only two parts of the Manor. He further was in receipt of 25s. Q\\d. rent, from 12 free tenants, and of 59s. rent, from eight customary tenants in the vill of Ardeleston.2 In the Nomina Villarum of March 1316, John de Hanlowe (as husband of Maud Burnel) is entered as Lord of Welinton? but an Escheator's Rob1, which just preceded Hanlowe's livery, shows that only two parts of Welynton and Ardesleston had as yet fallen to Edward Burnel's heir.4 Some Undertenants of Wellington will appear in connection with the members of the Manor. Others were as follows. \u2014 Philip de Wellington occurs before 1189 and after 1215; but possibly there were two cotemporaries, one a Clerk, the other a Layman. Philip de Wellington, if a single person, was a Clerk, and Rector of the Church ; but he had a son Thomas. In the year 1200 Philip de Welinton fines one merk for license to make assart of some forest-land. By a Fine levied on November 19, 1236, Egidius de Erdinton, Plaintiff, in a suit of mort d'ancestre against Thomas fitz Philip, Tenant, of a virgate in Welinton, concedes the same for a sum of 100s. to be held in fee, by Thomas and his heirs, under Egidius and his heirs at a rent of 6s. The Feoffee here is doubtless identical with that Thomas de Welintun who has been 1 Rot. Forinsec. 33-4, Edw. I. = Inquis. 9 Edw.

In 1262 I should suppose him to have been deceased, for, on the Forest-Roll of that date, his name appears under the heading Essonia Mortis, the Essoignor being Roger fitz William. About the year 1230, Henry Prior of Wombridge grants to Richard son of Hugh de Loskesford (Losford) that virgate in the vill of Valeton which Seeburga mother of Alan de Hadley had given to the Priory. Rent, a pound of cummin or 6c?. In exchange, Richard gives to the Priory his Mill in the Manor of Chelwordin (Cheswardine) at a rent of 10s. The Priory is also to pay a further rent of 3s. which Richard would hand over to the Abbot of Haugh mond, under whom the said Mill was held. Besides it was agreed that if Richard had swine in the wood of Ercalew he should give one hog annually to the Priory. Witnesses, Hugh fitz Robert, Wilbam de Hadley, Walter de Optun (Waters Upton), Philip de Peninton, Thomas de Hadley, Roger de Eppelee.1 At the Forest-Iter of 1262, the Justices assessed the men of the Manor of Wellington 20s. for license to get marl in the King's Haye there. Forester's Fee. This consisted of half a virgate of land in Wellington, held by serjeantry. The Tenant's duty was to take custody of Wellington-Hay e, or that portion of the Wrekin Forest which is still marked by the locality called the Hay -Gate. Tbis Serjeantry was probably established by one of the Norman Earls, or by Henry I. ; for, if it had been endowed so late as the reign of Henry II. , it would have worked a diminution of the manorial re venue of Wellington, which diminution the Sheriff must have noticed on the Pipe- Rolls. As to Stephen's dealings with Royal Manors they are out of the question, as having been annulled by his suc cessor. The first whom I can name as probable Tenant of this Serjeantry was \u2014 Hugh Forester, whom we have seen attesting a Leegomery Deed, about 1187-97.2 In or about the year 1200, the Tenant of the same Serjeantry was called \u2014 Robert de Wellington. In the Caruage assessed at that time (as I have described it under Bolas3) Robert de Wolint' is enrolled as \"holding a Serjeantry of the King, viz. hab\" a virgate by custody 1 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit. Wel- lington, No. iiij. S Supra, Vol. VII. p. 311. 3 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 266."], [67, "WELLINGTON. 47 and preserving of the King's Haye.\" Its value was 4s. per annum ; and the Tenant proffered to compound for the current tax by pay ment of half a merk.1 At the Forest Assizes of 1209, Robert the Forester is one of those who was assessed for cultivation of land within the Forest of Mount Gilbert. A Fragment of an Assize-Roll, belonging to the year 1227, calls the Wellington- Haye the Haye of Eyton, and enters Robert de Welinton as Custos thereof by Serjeantry. I think it must have been a second \" Robert Forester of Wellington,\" who stands sixth Recognizor in that great technical question which was tried about the year 1242, by the Sheriff, Chief Forester, and Verderers of Shropshire, viz. the expeditation of dogs on the estates of Lilleshall Abbey. \u2014 His seal is one of those which still remains appended to the Jurors' return.3 It exhibits a rude cruciform device, and the Le gend, \u2014 S' Roberti de Welinton. In 1249, Robert Forester was a Juror on the Inquest which fol lowed the death of his chief, \u2014 Hugh fitz Robert of Bolas. In Geoffrey de Langley's arrentation of assarts (about January 1250) it appears that 4| acres of the King's demesne at Welinton had been assigned to Robert de Welinton, for which he was to pay an annual Crown-rent of 6s. 9c?. Three years' arrears of this rent are charged in the Pipe-Roll of 1252. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes the above acquisition of Robert Forester as \"a pourpresture of 4 acres and 1 rood (read 2 roods), made since the eyre oi John Bulet, and for which 18c?. per acre, or a sum of 6s. 9c?., was annually payable to the King.\" As to the Serjeantry of Robert Forester of Welinton the same Record describes it as \" half a virgate, held freely of the King, to wards the custody of Wellington Haye.\" The customs of the said Haye are fully, but not very inteUigibly, enumerated. The cattle (averia) of the men of Welbngton were admitted throughout the year except in St. John Baptist's month (June) and between Mi chaelmas and Martinmas. The charges for pannage were 2e?. for yearling swine, lc?. for swine six months old, but nothing for lesser swine (nichil pro porcellis) . These exceptions and charges seem to be justified by the Record, as arising from the \"imparkment of the said haye, both in grass-time and pesson-time.\" The following perquisites were Robert Forester's, viz. the retropannage (by which 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 57. 2 The Original, at Trentham."], [68, "48 WELLINGTON. I understand what was left after the pesson season), the dead wood, and all windfalls (boughs or whole oak-trees), unless more than five oaks were blown down at a time. In that case the surplus went to the King. Two burnings of lime are further mentioned as having recently taken place in Wellington Haye. The lime was for use of the Crown ; and the quantity may be imagined from the number of oak trees (500), stated to have been consumed in the operation. Recent Sales of 52 oak-trees and of eight shillings' worth of sand (sablicii) from Welbngton Haye, by the proper Officers, are likewise enumerated.1 In 1258 I find Robert de Welinton attending a Leegomery In quest. At the Forest- Assizes of February 1262, Robert de Welin ton, Forester, answered for the agistment of the Hayes of Welinton and Mors for eight preceding years. In 1255, 1256, 1258, 1259, 1260, and 1262, the pesson of the preceding Autumn had failed. The two remaining years (1257 and 1261) only yielded 19s. 3d. Robert de Welinton, one of the five Foresters-of-the-fee for Shropshire, is so entitled, when attending an Inquest at Bridgnorth in 1262. It is very remarkable that a Writ issued on June 28, 1278, an nouncing the death of Roger le Forester of Wellyngton, and that a Jury sat in consequence and took no notice of the error of the Writ as regarded the Christian name of the deceased. The Jurors found the said Roger to have held a messuage, a nokate, and an assart in capite, by service of keeping the haye of Wellington, which was within the Forest of the Wrekene. Roger his son and heir was 25 years osage on July 25, 1278. 2 In consequence I presume of more than one error in this Inquest another Writ of Diem clausit issued on August 24, 1279. Here the deceased is called Robert le Forester. An Inquest taken at Wellington on Sept. 29, 1279, found him to have held a half-vir gate in Wellington, worth 8s. per annum, \" by service of assisting to keep the bailiwick of the Forest of Mount Gilbert,\" also to have held one assart, for which he paid a rent of 8s. 4c?. to the Sheriff. Roger his son and heir was again found to be of full age.3 Roger fitz Robert de Webnton was deceased on December 12, 1283, and John fitz Hugh of Bolas was claiming custody of his heirs, as also of the heirs of any other Bailiff of a Shropshire Forest. Roger le Strange, then Justice of the Forest, was desited by Writ Royal to inquire into this claim. He assembled a Jury 1 Rot. Hundred, II. 56. 2 * 3 Inquisitions, 6 Edw. I., No. 108 ; 7 Edw. I., No. 78."], [69, "49 WELLINGTON. on April 3, 1284, which found that \"Wardship of the Bailiwick, lute Roger fitz Robert's, in La Wrekene, did not pertain to the King, but to John fitz Hugh, till the heir should be of age ; that John fitz Hugh's ancestors had always had such wardship ; and that it was worth 10s. per annum.\"1 It is curious here to mark the sequence of events. John fitz Hugh died in July following. On August 5, 1284, the King ac cepted the homage of Hugh fitz John, his heir ; and yet on May 14, 1285, the King issued a Writ of Diem clausit announcing the (long previous) decease of Roger le Forester of Welinton. A Jury, which met July 4, 1285, found that the deceased had held a half virgate and seven small assarts in capite. He had been Custos of the bailiwick of Wellington Haye and had paid a Crown-rent of 6s. 8c?. His whole estate was valued at 13s. 4c?. per annum. His son and heir, Roger, was found to have attained his majority on May 3, 1285.2 At the Assizes of 1292 the Bradford Jurors presented the state of Robert le Forester's Serjeantry; how it was worth 10s. per an num. Jacob de Morton now held a messuage in Welbngton, worth 3s. per annum, and which had been alienated from this Serjeantry. The Court ordered the seizure of this tenement in consequence of Jacob de Morton not appearing to give account of his possession thereof. Of six Royal Foresters-of-the-fee who met on June 6, 1300, to assist at the Great Perambulation of Shropshire Forests, Roger de Welinton was one. This Roger, whom we may cab Roger le Forester (II.) , appears to have been admitted a Burgess of Shrews bury in 1319. When he died I know not, but it was while his sou and heir was in minority ; for an Inquest was held at Wellington on October 17, 1335, to prove the age of\u2014 \" John, son and heir of Roger le Forester of Welynton.\" The Jurors found the said John to have been born and baptized at Wel lington on the Feast of St. Margaret the Virgin, 8 Edward II. (July 20, 1314) ; consequently that he had attained his full age on Thursday, July 20, 1335.3 ably understated the Father's age in 1278. 1 Inquisitions, 12 Edw. I., No. 39. 3 Inquis. 9 Edw.

For a further account of this family I refer elsewhere.1 There can be little doubt that the now ennobled House of Fo rester is descended from these ancient Tenants of the Crown, and that property near Wellington, which is or was in the possession of the present Lord Forester, included the very half-virgate of which I have said so much. This topographical fact will become more apparent when we shall have to trace the boundaries of Wellington Haye. WELLINGTON CHURCH. The Domesday mention of a Priest, resident at Wellington, indi cates the coexistence of a Church. Earl Roger's Charter to Shrews bury Abbey proves that within eight, perhaps within six, years after Domesday, he gave the said Church (called the Church of Woolk ington) to Shrewsbury Abbey. The Grant was specifically con firmed by William Rufus, Henry I., Stephen, Henry II. , and Henry III. Earl Hugh's spurious Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey gives thereto the tithes of his demesne of Welinton. His less suspected Charter gives the whole tithes of his demesnes of Ardulveston (Arleston), and of Eston (Aston-under- Wrekin) ; and two-thirds of the tithes of his demesnes of Walington (Wellington), Hetleg (Hadley), and Walecote (Walcot). Bishop Clinton inspects and confirms a Charter of Earl Hugh, conveying two-thirds of the demesne-tithes of Welinton, Hedley, and Walecote, and the whole demesne-tithes of one virgate in Er dulfestou, and of Eston. The same Prelate confirms to the Abbey the Church of Welintun with its Chapels, and its pension of 2 merks. Bishop Durdent's Confirmation specifies \" the Church of Welinton with the tithe of the Manor and the tithe of Walecote, and the Chapels pertaining\" (to Wellington Church) . Bishop Peche's Confirmation specifies the tithes of Estone as tithes of the Shrews bury Monks' own demesne (a matter very consistent with what we shall see in the history of Aston) . As \" tithes of others\" the same Confirmation specifies two-thirds of the demesne-tithes of Wolinton and Wallecote. It also recognizes the pension of 2 merks, payable to the Abbey from Wellington Church. Later Confirmations, Episcopal and Archiepiscopal, are but repe titions of one or other of the above. Wellington remained a Rec tory, in the gift of Shrewsbury Abbey, and endowed with all groat 1 Sherifs of Shropshire, p. 126."], [71, "WELLINGTON CHURCH;\u2014 TAKEN DOWN IN 1789."], [72, ""], [73, "51 THE CHURCH. and small tithes of its Parish, except the demesne-tithes above spe cified, till the year 1232. Then did Alexander de Stavenby, Bishop of Lichfield, unite with Henry Abbot of Shrewsbury, in an unholy conspiracy. A parochial Church was to be looted, and the plun derers were to share the spoil : that is, half the gain was to increase the revenues of Shrewsbury Abbey, and half was to furnish forth a new Stall in the distant Cathedral of Lichfield. Read by this light Bishop Stavenby's Charter, appropriating the Abbot's share of this Rectory, is a piece of consummate hypocrisy, and something worse. He premises how the Almighty had given him a place in his Church, to the end that he should pity and assist the indigent. He goes on to explain whom he means by the indi gent. They are the Abbot and Monks of Shrewsbury, whose hos pitality and penury (however inconsistent the two attributes appear to us) had attracted the Bishop's notice and claimed his aid. He gives them then half of all the garbs (i. e. corn-tithes) of the Church of Welynton under Mount Gilbert, and of the Chapels annexed to that Church, and of all its hamlets (villularum) ; \u2014 to hold for their proper uses. He also reserves to the Abtc:y its previous receipts in the said Parish, as already confiinjed by his Predecessors. He re serves too for the uses of those perpetual Vicars who were hence forth to minister in the said Church, these things, viz. the small tithes, the altarage receipts, the arable glebe, the rents of those who held lands of the Church, the tithes of Mills, and all pensions of Chapels. The future Vicars were to be presented by the Abbey, and being instituted were to bear all Archidiaconal burdens. This Charter was expedited by hand of Philip, the Bishop's Chaplain, on July 1, 1232, and was attested by Master R. de Longedon his Offi cial, Alexander Archdeacon of Salop, Master Ralph de Lacok, Mas ter Alexander Blund, and others.1 William Prior of Coventry (in office 1249 and 1257) afterwards joined with his Convent, in sanctioning the above Appropriation.2 William Dean of Lichfield, and his Chapter, concurred in sanction ing the same, in a Charter which passed on September 18, 1246.3 Nothing is here said about the Bishop's other motives, or how, obtaining the other moiety of the Great Tithes of Wellington as a reward of his complicity, he was enabled to found therewith the Prebend of Wellington in Lichfield Cathedral. Such however was the unwritten or unrecorded part of the original bargain. On Feb. 23, 1248, Roger de Weseham, then Bishop of Lichfield, 1 \u2022 *\u2022 Lichfield Register, A. so. 14, b. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 69."], [74, "52 WELLINGTON. settled a dispute which had arisen between Adam (II.) Abbot of Salop and Roger de Corthover, Canon of Lichfield, about their shares of the tithes of Wellington. The Bishop first decrees that \" Roger de Corthover be restored to his Prebend of Welintone,\" which is to comprise the following items, viz. half the tithes of 13 bovates of arable land in Aston, which were held in villainage under Shrewsbury Abbey; the hay-tithes to the same land belonging; the common-right to the said Prebend belonging ; half the tithes of novalia brought into cultivation since Bishop Stavensby's Ordina tion, and of all novalia hereafter to be brought into cultivation in Wellington Parish. To the Abbey are reserved the foUowing, \u2014 viz. the hay-tithes of Wellington Parish (generally) ; \u2014 the tithes of the Abbatial demesnes at Aston; \u2014 and two-thirds of all tithes of Hadley, Welinton, Erdleveston (Arleston), and Walcote. This set tlement was made at Wombridge, in the presence of Richard Arch deacon of Chester, Henry de Wysawe the Bishop's Official, and several Clerks.1 The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Welinton (in Salop Deanery) at \u00a36 for the part of Shrewsbury Abbey, and at \u00a32. 13s. 4d. for the Vicarage.2 The Prebend of Welinton was valued at \u00a310.3 The assessment of Wellington Parish to the ninth, in 1341, in volves a complex blunder. The Assessors first quote the Church- Taxation as 9 merks (or \u00a36. 13s. 4c?.), a sum which tallies with nothing in Pope Nicholas's Valor. They then assess the Parish at 16 merks (\u00a310. 13s. 4c?.) to the current tax, adding that such assess ment was \u00a37. 13s. 4-i. in excess of the Taxation.* I must leave this matter as it stands. It is only evident that when the Assessors quote the Church-Taxation as 9 merks, they were deceived in par ticulars, but knew well enough that such data did not afford a pro per criterion for their assessment. Among the receipts of Shrewsbury Abbey, given in the Valor of 1534-5, are the following. \u2014 Income from a moiety of the tithes of Welbngton \u00a310 Portion of tithes in Welyngton, Ardston, and Hadley \u00a3l.6 At the same time Nicholas Stokysby, Prebendary of Wellington, received \u00a310 per annum in tithes and other emoluments.6 As to the Vicarage, Alan Charleton, Incumbent thereof, received on an average \u00a310 per annum, out of which he paid 5s. for synodals and 10s. for Procurations.7 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 66. 1 2 \u2022 3 Pope Nich.

Philip de Welinton, Parson or Rector of this Church, occurs before 1189 and after 1215, unless there were a Layman, his co temporary, from whom I cannot distinguish him. Sir Thomas Lyart occurs between 1275 and 1285 as Perpetual Vicar of Wellington. He was perhaps also Rector of Preston.1 Alexander, Vicar of Wellington, had letters of Protection in 25 Edw. I. (1296-7) .2 Philip de Byriton, Priest, was instituted to this Vicarage July 25, 1302; \u2014 the Abbot and Convent of Salop presenting. On March 23, 1329, Philip, Vicar of Welynton, being worn out with age and infirmity, the Bishop appoints Sir Benedict de Frodesley, Chaplain, to be his Coadjutor. An Inventory was to be taken of the Vicar's goods, of which the Coadjutor would have to give ac count. Sir John, Vicar of Wellington, died July 28, 1349, \u2014 probably of the pestilence. His successor was, \u2014 John de Umfreston, Chaplain, instituted August 5, 1349, at the presentation of Shrewsbury Abbey. Hugh, Vicar of Wellington, is named in a Deed which must have passed very shortly after 1349.3 John Hychcok, Vicar of Wellington, has a year's license of non-residence, dated Oct. 23, 1366.

Nigel de Weaver is said to have had the Prebend in the same year (1349) .*- John de Pipe was collated Aug. 2, 1351, and died in 1361, being then Archdeacon of Coventry. Five Berewicks are mentioned in Domesday as appurtenances of the Manor of Welbngton. It is probable that the Record did not intend to make Dawley one of the five, for it had been sepa rated, as to tenure, from Wellington, as early as Edward the Con fessor's reign. In other words it was no part of Earl Edwin's De mesne-Manor of Wellington, for Grim held it in Saxon times. Excluding then Dawley, we may identify with wonderful cer tainty the five Berewicks, to which Domesday alludes. They were Apley, Arleston, Aston, Dothill, and Walcot. APLEY, now APLEY CASTLE. John de Appeley attests Ivo Pantulfs Confirmation of Buttery to Shrewsbury Abbey.2 This was about 1170-1175. Between 1177 and 1189 a Charter of Symon fitz Symon (then Lord of Wel lington) is attested first by Walter de Appel', and then by John de Appel'. Again between 1187 and 1197 we have Walter de Eppelle attesting John de Cumbray's grant to Wombridge Priory, and this I doubt not was the person whose name is written as Walter de El-pole, and who having been Recognizor in a Longford Suit about 1191 was living to certify the particulars thereof in 1200. 3 At the Assizes of October 1203 Walter de Eppele was amerced balsa merk. Cotemporary with the latter part of Walter de Apley's career, Roger de Apley occurs, viz. as witness of a Wombridge Charter which must have passed as early as 1202-3.4 This Roger occurs on Jury Lists of all but certain date, viz. in 1220 and 1242, and in the latter instance he sat as one of the Verderers of the Forest. His attestations of Charters range a few years later. It was perhaps he who married Clarice, Coheiress of Rodington. Meanwhile Wil liam de Apley occurs twice as a witness between 1236 and 1241 so that I cannot but think that there were two families, both 1 Le Neve's Fasti,Yo\\.

In 1258 Walter and John de Apley sat on a Leegomery Jury. The latter was of Rodington.1 After this I hear of a John de Apley only. As the male line of Apley of Rodington was now extinct, I think this John must have been of Apley. He occurs as a Juryman in In quests of 1264, 1279, 1280, 1281, 1284, 1285, 1292, 1293, 1294, and 1295. In one instance (that of 1285) he sat as a Regarder of the Forest. How Alan de Cherlton became possessed of Apley I have not been able to discover. We have seen2 that in 1309 he obtained an estate at Haughton, near Shiffnal, by favour of John de Cherlton, his elder3 brother. The Feodary of 1316 makes him to have been Lord of Walton in Stottesden Hundred,4 but I find no evidence as to the origin or continuance of such a feoffment. In 1322 several Writs are addressed to him as Custos of the Castle and Land of Wigmore. This was in consequence of the forfeiture which then lay on the house of Mortimer. In May 1324 Sir Alan de Cherl ton was summoned in two Counties, Somersetshire and Hertford shire (probably Herefordshire was meant), to attend a Great Council at Westminster. In 1324 and 1325 several Writs are addressed to him in connection with military levies in Shropshire and Stafford shire, but on April 18, 1325, he was superseded in these commis sions, being employed on active duty under the King. In January 1326 he occurs again as a Chief Inspector of array in Herefordshire and Worcestershire.5 One of the first acts of King Edward III. was granting a license to Alan de Cherleton, enabling him to embattle his Mansions of Apley and Withforde (Withyforde) .6 Here, as regards Withyford, we light on a chronological difficulty which has probably been the root of all the errors with which the genealogy of Charlton of Apley is encumbered. It is not known and can only be guessed what interest Alan de Cherlton had at Withyford in 1327. It was his son, a second Alan, who afterwards married Margery fitz Aer, the heiress of Withyford. clearly younger brother, not nephew, of John de Cherlton (I.) of Powis. If both Alan and John were sons of some pre vious Alan (which I doubt), that A Inn was certainly not of Apley. 1 Vide supra, Vol. VII. p. 380. 2 Supra, Vol. II. p. 324. 3 The statement (Blakeway's Sheriff's, p. 76) that Alan de Cherlton of Apley was elder brother of John de Cherlton of Powis, and father of Alan de Cherlton (of Apley in 1327) seems to me quite in accurate.

Possibly Alan de Cherlton Senior was her Guardian in 1327, and thus took care of her interests as the affianced wife of his son, but I know of no second Licentia crenellandi granted under such cir- cumstances. The wife of Alan de Cherlton (I.) was Elena la Zouch, eldest daughter and Coheir of Alan, last Baron Zouche of Ashby, who died in 1314.1 From various Inquests2 I gather the following dates. \u2014 Elena la Zouche was born about June 1287. In August 1314, she was found to be 27 years of age, and was then the wife of Nicholas de St. Maur. By him she had two sons, viz. Thomas, vari ously stated to have been born in 1304, 1306, and 1307, and Nicho las who must have been born in or before 1317, seeing that in De cember 1316, his father died. Of these two, Thomas died without issue, and Nicholas, the eventual heir of his Mother, and Continuator ofthe line, died in 1361. On her first husband's death, and about 1317-8, Elena la Zouch, now 30 years of age, remarried with Alan de Cherlton of Apley.3 To him she bore a son, Alan, of whom I shall speak presently. She died long before her husband, but he, as Tenant by Courtesy of England, held her Devonshire estates till his own death, which took place on December 3, 1360. \u2014 Then they reverted to his late wife's son and heir, viz. to Nicho las de St. Maur (II.) . Alan de Cherlton (II.) may possibly have been born as early as 1318. His wife Margery fitz Aer was born April 14, 1314. The date of their marriage may be surmised from the fact that their eldest son John de Cherlton was born on February 2, 1340. Alan de Cherlton (II.) , probably as a precaution, demised his wife's estates at Aston Eyre, and Withyford, to his own father, to hold for life, at a rent of \u00a320 payable to the son or his heirs. His Father survived him long ; for Alan Junior fell a victim to that Great. Pestilence which desolated England in 1349. He died on or about the third of May in that year, leaving his eldest son, John, an infant of nine years. On this occasion the King, as Custos of the Infant Tenant-in-capite of Harcott, seized on the \u00a320 rent 1 Vide supra, Vol. II. p. 209. interesting fact in connection with Alan de Cherlton (I.) and his wife Elena.

In 1356, Richard Earl of Arundel complained ofthe above seizure, as serting his own claim to the above rent and to the custody of the heir, because tbe said Earl was Seigneural Lord of Aston-Eyre and Withyford. The curious evidence, which was elicited by this question of law and usage, I will give under Great- Withyford, as it does not relate to Apley. Suffice it here to say that it was all in favour of the Earl, who proved by Inquest that Harcott was held of the King, not De Corona, but De Eschaetd ; and that such tenure did not entitle the King to wardship over the person or the other estates of the heir of Harcott. The Earl further adduced a precedent, viz. that, when Margery fitz Aer was in minority, Edward II. had indeed custody of Harcott, but Edmund, then Earl of Arundel, had custody of Aston- Eyre, and Withiford. Probably Richard Earl of Arundel became entitled to the ward ship of Jobn de Cherlton in 1356, and received \u00a320 rent from Alan de Cherlton Senior, till the death of the latter in December 1360. Within half a year of that event John de Cherlton wiU have attained his majority. ARLESTON. I have told how Henry II. granted a part of Arleston to Seburga de Hadley.1 The story of the King's making Arleston his abode, whilst on a hunting expedition, is corroborated by a topographical observation, viz. that Arleston formed one boundary of that well preserved part of the Wrekin Forest which was known as Welling ton Haye. In the Forest-Roll of 1180, the men of Erdelveston are assessed 3s. Qd. for imbladements of 3| acres, sown with corn. Between 1178 and 1189, we have seen William de Herdulveston attesting a Deed of Simon fitz Simon, then Lord of Wellington. In the Forest-Roll of 1209, the Vill of Erdulveston is collectively assessed by the Regarders of Mount Gilbert; and Richard Siward, a Free holder there, is separately charged for imbladements. At this period, as we have seen, Arleston was a more populous place than Welling- ton. In October 1283, a Fine was levied, whereby John de Aure and Eve his wife, for themselves and the heirs of Eve, quitclaimed 5 \u25a0 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 353, 354. 8"], [80, "58 WELLINGTON. messuages, 2 acres of meadow, and li virgates of land in Ardulston, to Hugh Burnell (who was then Lord of Wellington, and probably held over the Quit claimants) . A sore sparrow-hawk is the alleged consideration of this surrender. Hu\u00b0-h Burnell's Seigneury over Arleston has been further illus trated by an Inquest of the year 1284, as I have set it forth under Wellington. Here the place is called Ardelfeston, which suggests its real etymology, viz. Ardulfs-town. ASTON UNDER THE WREKIN. This member of Wellington was given by the Empress Maude to Shrewsbury Abbey. Her Charter is dated at Devizes, and probably passed in 1141, when she first obtained possession of that town, and held Stephen as her Prisoner. Styling herself \" Matilda the Empress, daughter of King Henry,\" and addressing William fitz Alan and all her lieges, French and English, in Shropshire, she certifies her said gift of the vill of Eston. The Deed is attested by Rainaldo Vicecomite (it should surely be Comite) de Cornwall' ; WiUiam fitz Alan ; Robert de Dunestavill and Goe' (Jjaceas) de Dinan.1 This grant was confirmed by Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury, and also by Henry IL, when before Bridgnorth in 1155. It is re cognized in all the Pipe-Rolls, from 1156 to 1166, the Sheriff de ducting the assumed value of Aston from the Firma Comitatus, in the foUowing or some simdar words. \u2014 In terris datis .* \u2014 Monachis de Salopesbia 68s. Sd. in Eston. In 1167, this entry is discontinued, and it is clear that the Monks lost the estate. All that I can offer in explanation of this is that the date coincides with the year of Abbot Robert's death, and that his successor, Adam, was deposed in 1175. Between the years 1178 and 1189, we have Hayluiet de Eston attesting a Charter of Simon fitz Simon, Lord of Wellington, and it is probable that the said Hayluiet held under the said Simon, and not under the Abbey. Now again we shaU have occasion to observe the consonance of a Monastic Record with the Pipe-Rolls. If Henry II. took Aston from the Abbey, Richard I. restored it. By a Charter dated at Poitiers on February 18, 1190, that King informs William fitz Alan (he was Sheriff at the time) that he has conceded the vill 1 Chartulary, No. 50. In her more general Charter to the Abbey (No. 40) the Empress mentions her own grant of Eston last of any. This Charter is at tested hke the one in the text, except that Rainald is called Comes."], [81, "59 ASTON called Eston to Salop Abbey. This Deed was attested by William Bishop of Poiutou, Peter Bertin Seneschal of Poitou, Osbert de Roveray and Stephen de Longchamp, Sewers (Dapiferis) . It was also expedited by hand of John de Alencun, Archdeacon of Liseux.1 The Pipe-Roll for the year ending Michaelmas 1190, gives appa rent effect to this Writ by according the Abbot of Shrewsbury \" 60 sobdates of land in Eston, a member of Welinton according to Charter of the King.\"3 This entry was repeated at Michaelmas 1191 ; but at Easter 1192, only 30s. (or half a year's fruition of the land itself) are assigned to the Monks. It is obvious that the King's Writ of that year (which included Aston among the Royal estates which were to furnish a half-year's income of \u00a310 to William and James fitz Simon) operated, whether by accident or not, to disseize the Monks of the land. Accordingly we find the Sheriff giving the Monks \u00a32 in money pro terrd quam Rex dedit eis in Eston donee eadem terra eis delibetur. So too in 1193, he gave them \u00a32 in money; but in 1194 (the very year of King Richard's return) the land was restored to the Monks ; its fiscal value being computed as 20s. for the first half of the current year, and as 30s. for the last half. In 1195, the Sheriff returned to the old formula \u2014 Et Mona chis de Salop 60s. in terra de Eston ,- and this continued as long as the Pipe-Rolls are evidence on such matters. Thomas de Eston was a notable person in the affairs of Shrews bury Abbey, and doubtless held lands here. Among his numerous attestations of Abbatial Deeds some are at least as early as 1210, others at least as late as 1226. In two instances he is called Se neschal, and I have no doubt that he held that office in the Abbot's Manorial Court in the Abbey- Foregate of Shrewsbury. Thomas de Eston was succeeded in estate, and perhaps in Office, by his son Benedict, who attests Deeds in 1231, 1232, and 1234, and perhaps later; but, as we shall see, he was dead in 1240. The following Deed is in the nature of a surrender from Tenant to Lord. \u2014 \" Benedict de Aston, son late of Thomas de Aston, gives to Salop Abbey two moors in the fields of Aston (one caUed Aylwyesmor and the other called Bradelemor), together with a stank for the Vivary above Bradewey and with the overflow (refullacione aqu\u00e6) of the said Vivary. For this he received 40s. Witnesses, William de Draiton Chaplain, Alan his son.\"3 On November 12, 1240, a Fine was levied, whereby Isolda widow j lue of Aston (68s. 8d.) to 60*. is observable.

I cannot teU where Subegh was, nor do I know anything further of Stephen de Aston, as connected with Aston. Thomas le Hore of Aston occurs as a Surety in 1272. About the year 1280 Richard son of Robert de Cherleton gives to Robert his brother for 5s. paid, annual rents of 3s. 8c?. arising from land w hich Alan son of William de Eyton held of the Grantor in the viU of Aston under Wreken. He also gives a certain mea dow in the field of Cherleton (as before described). For the afore said rent, the Grantee is to pay two pounds of wax yearly, for the lights of St. Nicholas in Uppington Church, and 7d. at Michaelmas to Salop Abbey. To the Grantor he must pay a rent of one rose.

He bequeaths curses and maledictions to any succeeding Abbot who should intromit with the said rent.3 We have seen, under Eyton-upon-Severn, that in 1285 Aston was accounted a member of that Manor. I have accordingly under Eyton, given some account of its value, as stated in the later Rent- Rolls of the Abbey. DOTHILL. We have seen Hemming de Dotrel attesting a Deed of Simon fitz Simon, Lord of Wellington, between 1178 and 1189. A Fine of November 15, 1248, is practically a feoffment of John de Preers in Dothill by Giles de Erdinton, then Lord of Wel lington. The Fine purports to be between John de Preers, Plain tiff, and Egidius de Erdinton, Impedient, of one carucate in Dot hull, whereof was Plea of Charter Warranty between them: Now Erdinton acknowledges himself to have given the premises (viz. all the lands which he had in the said vill) to Preers.

I find John de Praers on local Ju ries of 1279 and 1293, and frequently attesting Deeds of the period. In Easter Term 1282, a Fine was levied whereby Adam Buche and his wife Sibil, Matthew le Serjaunt of Dunchirche and his wife Isabel, for themselves and the heirs of Sibil and Isabel, quitclaim to John le Preyer (Tenant), a messuage and six bovates in Appeley, whereof was Suit-at-law. For this John le Preyer gave 60s. WALCOT. This member of Wellington, comprising three carucates of land and a Mill, was given by the Empress Maude to the Monastery of Haughmond. The Charters and Confirmations which treat of this gift have already been recited.1 The fiscal value of Walcot was \u00a33. Ils. 4c?.; and, we find from the Pipe-Rolls that Henry IL, im mediately on his accession, recognized his mother's grant. \u2014 The Sheriff of 1156 discharges his own liabUities of a sum of \u00a33. Ils. 4c?. for land given to the Abbot of Hageman. This item of account never varies, but some later Pipe-Rolls express the loca bty of the grant, viz. in Walecotd. In 1255 the Bradford Hundred-Roll says that \"the Abbot of Haemon holds Walcot, (taken) out of the Manor of Welinton, by gift of King Henry. It is one hide, and does no suit to County or Hundred.\"2 The Feodary of 1284 erroneously makes Walcote a member of Wrockwardine, and states that the Abbot of Hamond held it in free alms of John le Strange ,\u2014 a second error the consequence of the first. Surely the Bradford Jurors of 1292 had the evidence of this Feodary, in sight or in mind, when they presented that the \" Abbot of Haghmon held Walcote, which the Ancestors of Fulk le Strange used to hold in-capite, of the King,\" and that they (the Jurors) knew not the Abbot's warrant.

Here the Coheirs of Hamo Peve rel retained their last hold on the County which had nursed his fortunes. Here the Chancellor BurneU, never sated with acquisi tion, reconsolidated in himself a Seigneury which had been severed for more than a century. In later times Ercall was the Caput of those vast estates which formed the heritage of the Newports ; \u2014 a heritage than which none greater has accrued to any single Shrop shire family, since the advent of the Normans. As regards its Saxon and Domesday status, High Ercall corre sponds with Welbngton. \" The Earl himself holds Archelou. Earl Eduin held it with five Berewicks. Here are vn hides.

In King Edward's time the Manor was worth \u00a320 per annum. Now it is worth the same. According to a custom, when the Countess visited the Manor, eighteen sums of 20c?.1 (each) used to be brought to her.\"2 The five Berewicks of Ercall I take to have been Tern, Sleap, Crudgington, and two places called Wilsithland and Scurlow in an cient documents. It had other members of less prominent note, and perhaps of later origin, or involved in some of the Berewicks. As to proportionate hidage, Tern was 1 hide, Sleap and Crudgington were 1\\ hides, and Ercall, with its other members, was 4| hides. Now if we were to believe Earl Hugh's spurious Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, we should infer that within twelve years after Domesday, he or his Father had enfeoffed Hamo Peverel in Ercall. In the said Charter the Earl is made to state that one of his Barons, Hamo Peverel, standing with him before Earl Roger's tomb, and moved by his (Earl Hugh's) example and request, granted the tithes of his demesnes to the said Abbey. Among tbe said demesnes, Arkaloua, Wilsitheland, Cleya (read Sclepa), and Brugeltona (read Crugeltona) are specified. AU that we can conclude from this statement is that the Monk, who forged this Charter (long after its ostensible era), found his Abbey seized of the said tithes, or parts thereof, and knew that Hamo Peverel had some time been Lord of Ercall and its members. The Monk thought it no wrong to asso ciate the two facts according to a theory of his own. Turning to that Charter of Earl Hugh, which I have always up held as somewhat less suspicious than the above, I find that he himself gave two- thirds of the tithes of his demesne of Ercalou to Shrewsbury Abbey. I also find that Bishop Clinton, having in spected this last or some other Charter of Earl Hugh, to the Abbey, within 50 years of the Earl's decease, corroborated the fact of the Earl's having himself given the said two- thirds of the demesne-tithes of Archalou. That Hamo Peverel attended the Court of Hugh Earl of Shrews bury is certain. He was truly too one of his Barons, for he had mar ried Sibil, daughter and heir (or coheir) of Gerard de Tornay. But it was evidently King Henry I. who originaUy invested Hamo Pe verel in High Ercall. 1 Octodecim or\u00e6 denariorum, i.e. 30?. 2 Domesday, fo. 253, b, 2."], [86, "64 HIGH ERCALL. I have already dwelt at some length on the origin and succession of the Shropshire Peverels.1 Many of the difficulties which then beset the subject have now vanished. One clear rule of succession is estabhshed by the case of High Ercall, viz. that this Manor, as being given to Hamo Peverel himself, was allowed to descend to his coUateral heirs. Other Manors however, which he acquired with the heiress of Tornay, though he endeavoured to settle them on his own collateral heirs, were ultimately reseized by King Henry II. as Escheats, either because Gerard de Tornay's forfeiture had only been qualified by a life-grant to Hamo Peverel and his wife, or because Gerard de Tornay's heirs were extinct. A Tabular Pedigree will best show the succession of Hamo Pe verel's collateral heirs, but we have an extraordinary number of documents, which must needs be quoted to illustrate the mode of their descent. I have shown under Kinnerley that Hamo Peverel, immediately after Henry I.'s death, and so probably in 1136, gave the two vUls of Sleap and Crudgington to Shrewsbury Abbey, and how the grant was independent of his wife.2 I have shown under Uppington how Walcheline Maminoht, one of Hamo Peverel's presumed heirs, endeavoured, between the years 1138 and 1141, to get Crugelton back from the Monks, by giving Uppington instead; and I have shown how and why the bargain ultimately failed, though the Empress confirmed it in her Charter of 1141.3 In the same Charter the Empress speaks of Slepe in another way, viz. as an estate given to the Abbey since her father's death by Hamo Peverel. Crugelton and Sleap were thus severed from High Ercall, and continued the property of Shrewsbury Abbey till its Dissolution. As to Ercall and its other members, at Hamo Peverel's death, in or about 1138, they went to WiUiam Peverel (II.) of Dover, and to Walcheline Maminoht. Now it is certain that William Peverel (II.) was brother's son to Hamo Peverel : and in one of his deeds the Nephew expresses the exact relationship by speaking of Hamo as patruus meus. But it is far from certain how Walcheline Maminoht was related to Hamo Peverel. In one of his Deeds the said Walcheline de scribes WiUiam Peverel (I.) as his maternal Uncle, avunculus meus. Consequently he would have described Hamo Peverel, who was the said William's brother, by the same term. Omitting for the 1 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 104-107. 2 * 3 Supra, Vol. VIII. pp. 127-8, 152-3."], [87, "65 HIGH ERCALL. moment to contend for the stricter meaning of the word avunculus, and taking it to mean either paternal or maternal Uncle, it is im possible to imagine that Walcheline Maminoht can have stood in the former relation to Hamo Peverel. His Mother then must have been a Peverel, and the word avunculus advisedly used by him. But how then could Walcheline Maminoht, the sister's son, have stood pari passu, as a Coheir, with WiUiam Peverel (IL), the brother's son ? That he did so, for a time, is clear, and the impro priety of his doing so is perhaps proved by the simple fact, that neither he nor his heirs continued to do so. But, for the present, I am to speak of the period when William Peverel (II.) and Walcheline Maminoht stood in amity with each other as Coheirs of Ercall. \u2014 As we have seen, WUliam Peverel of Dover confirmed the grant of Crudginton which Hamo his Uncle (patruus) had made to Shrewsbury Abbey, and Walcheline Maminot stood first witness of the confirmation. Again we have seen that Maminot's proposed bargain with the Abbey was with William Peverel's sanction (con cedente Willielmo Peverel) and attestation. But the history of Ercall shows these Coheirs in yet another com bination. To Ercall belonged two Mills, as Domesday has shown us. One of these was Bradford Mill, and the locality is the more interesting as that which afterwards gave a name to a Hundred and a title to an Earldom. \u2014 This MiU Walcheline Maminoht and William Peverel agreed to bestow on the infant Monastery of Haughmond. Their Charters are preserved, one in substance, the other in reality. These monuments of an age of terror belong to the interval be tween 1141 and 1148. I give them verbatim. \u2014 Walkelinus Maminot omnibus hominibus Francis et Anglis et omnibus amicis suis, salutem.

They joined the first outbreak against Stephen in 1138. William Peverel raised his Vassals in Shropshire and Cambridge shire, where he inherited, from his Father or Uncle, the great Ho nour of Brunne. Walcheline Maminoht took the field as Castellan of Dover. William Peverel's operations belong to a future Chap ter of our History, for it was at Whittington and EUesmere that his chief influence lay. On July 25, 1241, when the Empress, then at Oxford, gave to MUo de Gloucester the Earldom of Hereford, William de Dovra (as William Peverel is called) and Walcheline Maminot were attesting witnesses. After this, and in 1144 (as I suppose) William de Dovre appears in Wiltshire. The Author of the Gesta Stephani, a partisan of the Usurper, describes William de Dovre as a \" man of military genius, crafty and fierce.\" In the year supposed, he built a Castle at Cricklade, subdued the Country, north and south of the Thames, harassed Stephen's partisans in every direction, especially those who occupied Oxford and Malmesbury.2 Similar was William de Dovre's work in the year 1145, when he caught the Castellan of Malmesbury, one of Stephen's ablest Lieutenants, in an ambuscade, and handed him over a prisoner to the Countess of Anjou,3 as the Stephanite Chronicler calls the Empress. At last, says the same Author, \" repenting of the evils and mise ries which he had ruthlessly worked upon folk, he sought the sacred precincts of Jerusalem, to expiate his sins, and there, performing many glorious deeds against the obstinate foes of Christianity, he was gloriously slain.\"4 1 The original Deed, late in possession of Mr. George Morris of Shrewsbury. *-\u2022*\u00bb\u2022*\u25a0 Gesta Stephani Regis (Edition 1846), pp. 106, 107, 111."], [89, "COHEIRS OF PEVEREL. 67 Here the crusade, which left England and France in 1147, must be alluded to. We may date the death of WUbam Peverel (II.) of Dover as having taken place in 1148, the same year in which Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Lichfield, fought and died in the same enter prise. Of Walcheline Maminoht, as claiming or holding anything in Shropshire, we shall hear no more. William Peverel died childless, and his Manor of Ercall, no less than his Barony of Brunne was now divided. He left four Sisters, his Coheirs. They were, (1) Matilda, wife of Hugh de Dover of Chilham, Kent; (2) Alice, wife of Hamo Peche; (3) Roisia, wife of Rollo de Harcourt; and (4) Ascelina, wife of Geoffrey de Walterville. Of the third sister, Roisia, I need say but little, as nothing was given to her in Shropshire. Ercall and Tern were divided in equal shares among the other three sisters ;\u2014 of all and each of whom I proceed to give some account. \u2014 It seems that the three Coheirs of Peverel were unwilling to make good the Abbot of Shrewsbury's title to Crugelton. Hence the following precept1 of King Henry II. issued between the years 1155 and 1158, that is before he had been three years on the throne. \u2014 Henricus Rex Angli\u00e6 fye, Hamoni Peech, et Gaufrido de Walter vill et Hugoni de Doura, salutem.

Hugh de Dover and Matilda his wife complied sooner or later with this order, and in its fullest sense.

William de Hetley or Hadley, was second son of Wil liam de Hadley (I.) by Seburga, natural daughter of Hamo Peverel, which Seburga was Matilda de Dover's Cousin. After the death of Henry I., either Hamo Peverel, or WiUiam Peverel (II.) , or his three Sisters in conjunction, enfeoffed William de Hadley in Ercall, by service of one knight's-fee. Hence in 1165 when Hugh de Dover made a return of his Cam bridgeshire Fees, he added these items to his account. \u2014 \" Radulfus de Tirna (tenet) xnam partem (unius feodi) in Salopescire,\" and \u2014 \" De novo fefamento ; Willelmus de Helleia (tenet) tertiam par tem militis in Salopescire post mortem H. (Henrici) Regis.\"1 I cannot stop to rectify many erroneous statements which have been made about Hugh de Dover, his Barony, and his successors. Suffice it to say that he was a great Baron of Kent and Sheriff of that County from 1161 to 1167; aud that he did not get his name \" De Dover\" from his wife : moreover that in the year 1172 he was deceased, without issue; when his Nephew, John de Dover, suc ceeded to his Kentish Barony and was in turn succeeded by his son Fulbert. Matdda Peverel, or de Dover, survived her husband, holding of course her share of the Barony of Brunne and of the Seigneury of Ercall and Tern. She was deceased in 1185, when all her inherit ances were or ought to have been divided into three parts and dis tributed between the representatives of her three sisters. There was some litigation as to the partition, and we shall see, with regard to Ercall and Tern, that two only of her sisters came to be repre sented there. Hamo Peche and Alice Peverel, his wife, must have been mar ried as early as 1134, for they had a daughter aged 50 in 1185. Between the years 1161 and 1172 \" Hamo Peeche, and his wife, and their son, Geoffrey, conceded to Shrewsbury Abbey a third part of Crugelton and of Slepe,\" mentioning how Hamo Peverel had made, and how Wilbam Peverel, his nephew, had heretofore con ceded and confirmed the grant. Witnesses, Richard (Peche) Bishop of Chester; the Abbot of Haemon; John and Wido le Strange; Alan and William de Hethley (Hadley); Robert fitz Nichel (of Shawbury) ; and Radulf de Time.2 1 These entries are given by Hearne (Liber Niger, I. 254), in a way which would lead to the erroneous idea that Tern was of new feoffment. The original Record (fo. 55) is more authoritative, making Tern of old, and Ercall of new feoffment. 2 'Salop Chartulary, No. 29."], [93, "71 COHEIRS OF PEVEREL. Hamo Peche was in his own right seized of a Barony in Suffolk, consisting of 12 old fees, which he duly returned in 1165. But there is a long supplement to this return, stating what Hamo Peche held in Cambridgeshire and Shropshire, \" of the Honour of Wil liam Peverel, and of the inheritance of his (Hamo's) wife.\" Hamo Peche speaks of two Cambridgeshire fees \" which William Peverel had given him in frank marriage with his sister,\" and part of which he himself had since bestowed on Baldwin de Roucestre with his own daughter in marriage. This is quite consistent with the idea that Hamo Peche was married as early as 1134, for William Peverel (II.) probably succeeded to the honour of Brunne, before he suc ceeded his Uncle, Hamo. But to continue ; \u2014 Hamo Peche's return has these further items. \"Et in Salopescire: Radulfus de Tirene (tenet) xnam partem i militis. Et de novo fefamento, Willelmus de Hetlega tertiam par tem i militis in Arcalun.\"1 Hamo Peche was Sheriff of Cambridgeshire from 1164 till Easter 1166. He was living in 1168 and paid scutage on 19 knights'-fees in that year. He died before 1185, leaving Alice Peverel his wife surviving, and leaving two sons, Geoffrey and Gilbert, of whom Geoffrey was the eldest.2 Geoffrey Peche is named on the Shropshire Pipe- Roll long before his Father's death. In 1159 the Sheriff had paid 20s. to Geoffrey Peccatum, by order of the King. In 1185 Alice Peverel and Geoffrey, her son, fined 100 merks to have their reasonable part of Brunne, as that which had been Ma tilda de Dover's. The opposing claimant was Albreda Trussebut who fined 50 merks for a like settlement.3 Of course each of the two parties was claiming a third of Matilda de Dover's inheritance, generally ; or, in other words, a ninth of the Barony and estates of Peverel of Dover: for Albreda Trussebut, nee Harcourt, was daughter and sole heir of Roisia Peverel. At this time (1185) Geoffrey Peche had married the widow of one Richard de Coleham. He was living in 1188-9, when he paid an instalment of some amercement set on him in Lincolnshire. He was deceased without issue in 1190; when \u2014 Gilbert Peche (his brother and heir) was charged scutage on 2 A Monastic Stemma (Monasticon, VI. p. 86, Num. II.) wrongly makes Gilbert the elder brother. i Liber Niger (Hearne), I. 251, 252. Tern was of old, Ercall of new feoffment, if we take the Record as a guide.

In 1194 Gilbert Peche paid scutage on an item of 1| knights' fees, which was distinct from either of the above. It was clearly, I think, for his third share of the estates of Matilda de Dover, his Aunt. That these assessments included something in Shropshire, we are assured by the Pipe-Roll of 1204; for, though the Coheirs of Peverel were never assessed in Shropshire, Gilbert Peche's ac quittal of King John's fifth Scutage is entered under that County in the year specified. In 1210 Gilbert Peche fined for permission to send two knights with King John to Ireland in lieu of himself. On July 9, 1212, he was dead ; and his lands were in custody of the King,1 who, on January 1, 1213, gave the said custody, and the marriage of GUbert Peche's heir, to Hugh de Boues.2 Another entry on this subject speaks of GUbert Peche's tenure as a \" Barony.\"3 It will be remembered that William de Hadley (II.) held one third of Ercall under Matilda de Dover and one-third under Peche. William de Hadley (II.) seems to have died subsequently to the time when Matilda de Dover's third of the Seigneury went to her Co heirs, and when consequently a ninth of such Seigneury devolved on Gilbert Peche. Hence the following Charter or renewal, re specting this specific Ninth, from Gilbert Peche to WiUiam de Hadley (III.).\u2014 Gillebertus Peccatum omnibus hominibus suis et amicis, Francis et Anglis, salutem.

One of these hostages was her own daughter Alice. Accordingly, on July 21, 1213, Fitz Walter having returned from exile, the King orders Alice Peche's daughter, Alice, and her other hostages to be restored.1 Hamo Peche (II.) was son and heir of Gilbert Peche. A minor in 1213, I find no assurance of his having obtained his majority till 1218, when he paid scutage on 17T',j knights'-fees of his own Barony aud on 5 knights'-fees of the Barony of Brunne. He is named in a Plea- Roll of Michaelmas Term 1232 as Hamo Pechie, and as suing one William de Henl' in a Plea of Customs and Service, alleged to be due on some land in Shropshire. I can not show that this affair related to Ercall or Tern. For some further particulars of Hamo Peche (II.) I refer else where.2 He married an Alien, by name Eve, and died in 1241 either in going on, or returning from, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Hamo Peche left six sons, GUbert, Hamo, Hugh, Robert, Thomas, and William. The eldest, whom we may call \u2014 Gilbert Peche (II.), translated the remains of his grandfather and grandmother, Gilbert and Alice, to a marble tomb in the Church of Barnwell Priory,3 of which House he was Patron, as being the eldest Coheir of Pagan Peverel its founder. His homage was accepted on December 11, 1241, the King's Writ noticing the circumstances of his Father's journey to Palestine, and death.4 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255, as touching the Seigneury of High ErcaU only says that the Tenant held it \" of the fee of Hamo Peverel ;\" but in respect of Tern, the late Tenant-in-fee is expressly said to have held it under Gilbert Peche. These are but incomplete statements, as statements respecting divided Seigneuries usuaUy are. I take it that GUbert Peche had four-ninths, or per haps a fall half, of the Seigneury of Ercall and Tern. Whatever his share, it is clear that between the years 1271 and 1274, he made Robert BurneU (then Archdeacon of York) Mesne-Lord, be tween himself and John de Ercall, the Tenant-in-fee of Ercall. This is shown in a Deed whereby \" Gilbert Pecche grants to Sir R. Burnell, Archdeacon of York, for his homage and service, the homage of Sir John de Erkalewe and his heirs, and the service of the same Sir John, which he or his ancestors had at any time ren dered to the Grantor or his Ancestors.\" He further gives \" the homage of Thomas Corbet, Lord of Hedle (Hadley), and the service 3 Leland's Collectanea, Vol. T. p. 283. 4 Rot. Finium, I. 363. > Rot. Patent, p. 101. 2 Dugd. Baronage, I. 677. 10 IX."], [96, "74 HIGH ERCALL. of the said Thomas.\" Of this clause in the Deed I shall speak elsewhere. The Deed goes on to provide that Sir Robert Burnell, his heirs and assigns, shall hold the premises under the Grantor and his heirs at the annual rent of one Chaplet of Roses. Another Deed or Writ is a Certificate from Gilbert Pecche to \" his beloved friend, Sir John de Erkalewe,\" whom he informs of the above transaction with Archdeacon Burnell, and on whom he enjoins all attention, obedience, and responsibility, henceforth due to the said Archdeacon. There are some difficulties about the further descent of Peche's Barony with which I deal briefly in a note.1 Suffice it here to say that in 1285 the (then nominal) seigneury of Peche at High Ercall had passed to Robert Peche, whom I suspect to have been one of Gilbert Peche's younger brothers. Under Robert Peche, Robert Burnell, now Bishop of Bath and Wells, held the Manor, freely and without doing any service to the Crown ; and under Robert Burnell held William de Ercall, the Tenant-in-fee. \u2014 Again this account is incomplete, the part being put for the whole, as we shall hereafter see. On the death of Philip Burnell (nephew and heir of the Bishop) in 1294, William de Erkalewe was found to have been holding the Manor of Erkalewe, under the said Philip, by service of a knight's fee, and it was valued at \u00a320 per annum? 1 Dugdale has confused Gilbert Peche (II.) with a subsequent Gilbert, \u2014 pro bably his younger son. Gilbert Peche (IL), by his first wife Matilda de Hast ings, had two sons, viz. John and Ed mund. The said Matilda died apparently about 1264-5, or during the period of Montfort's usurpation. Gilbert Peche (II.) remarried with Joan, daughter of Sir Simon de Grey, on whose children he contrived to settle the bulk of his estates. The residue of his Barony he gave to King Edward I., probably about the year 1284. He died in 19 Edward I. (1290-1). Thus much I gather from Leland, and from the Monastic Stemma already cited : but a more authentic Record partly con firms the story of Gilbert Peche' s dishe ritance of his eldest son, though the latter would seem to have been a voluntary suf ferer. In January 1274 Gilbert Peche enfeoffed John, his son and heir, in the Essex Manor of Plecheden. John was seized thereof five months, but then set tled it on his father, Gilbert, and on Gil bert's wife, Joan, conjointly ; \u2014 with re mainder to the heirs of Gilbert by the said Joan. In December 1291 Joan wid ow of Gilbert Peche complained that the Eschetor had seized Plecheden and Magna Trillawe (Suffolk) for the Crown, though she and her late husband were Joint-Feof fees thereof. The Inquest which followed found the above facts as regards Pleche den (Inquis. 20 Edw. I., No. 43). I take it, then, that the Gilbert Peche who had military summons as a Baron in 1299, and who was Lord of Great Thurlow (Suffolk) in 1316, was eldest son of Gil bert Peche (II.) by Joan de Grey, and the Founder of a new Barony. What be came of the right heirs of Gilbert Peche (II.) is matter of conjecture. 2 Inquisitions, 22 Edw. I., No. 45, d."], [97, "COHEIRS OF PEVEREL. 75 After this, I hear nothing more of the Tenure of Ercall, except as held, by the Tenant-in-fee, under the BurneUs, and, by the Bur nells, in capite. Such mesne rights as had been retained by Peche were merely nominal, and, in accordance with the spirit of the age, were likely to become obsolete. I must now return to speak of \u2014 Rollo de Harcourt and his wife Roisia, third sister and co heir of WiUiam Peverel (II.). In the first partition of William Peverel's estates, Roisia took nothing in Ercall and Tern. Her share was made up to her elsewhere, principally at Braunston in Northamptonshire. But on Matilda de Dover's death, about 1185, a third of the Seigneury of Ercall and Tern must have stood for division between three coheirs. Boisia's representative was now her daughter Albreda, wife of WUliam de Trussebut of Wartre (Co. York). The said Albreda should, in the ordinary course, have had a ninth of the said Seigneury, but I do not find that she or her heirs (of whom I shall have to speak elsewhere) obtained or held such a share. Probably it became merged in the two greater divi sions of four-ninths each which accrued to the heirs respectively of Matilda and Ascelina Peverel. This brings us to \u2014 Geoffrey de Walterville and his wife Ascelina, fourth sister and coheir of WUliam Peverel (H.). \u2014 About 1141, we have Geoffrey de WaterviUe attesting a Charter of the Empress Maud.1 Somewhat later we have seen Ascelina (Peve rel) attesting her brother's grant to Haughmond Abbey. Between 1155 and 1158, we have seen Henry II. addressing Geoffrey de WaltervUle as one of Hamo Peverel's Coheirs, concerned in Ercall. But better than all this we have a Deed which speaks plainly of Geoffrey de WalterviU's tenure of one-third of ErcaU. It is his actual grant thereof to that same William de Hadley whom we have seen obtaining the other two-thirds of the Manor. The Deed passed between 1155 and 1162, probably about 1160.

The restora tion of the Laeies by Henry II. possibly obliterated the specific alienation, by rein vesting them with the estate in question. 1 Monasticon, V. 409. 2 It is probable, from this expression, that during Lacy's forfeiture, and towards the end of Henry I.'s reign, something in his Shropshire Fief had been bestowed"], [98, "76 HIGH ERCALL. quam hie nominavi dedi illi pro servicio terci\u00e6 partis unius militis faciendo ; et ideo volo et firmiter precipio quod per hoc servicium quod hie nominavi earn teneat i1 bene et in pace cum omnibus liber- tatibus et cum omnibus pertinenciis, sicut Hamo Piperellus avunculus uxoris me\u00e6 usque \" illam melius et quietius uno die et una node tenuerit.

Geoffrey de Walterville was deceased in 1162. Consequently it is his widow who, as Ascelin' de Waltervill, was assessed to the scutage of that year, as Tenant of five knights'-fees in Cambridge shire and Huntingdonshire ; \u2014 obviously her share of the Barony of Brunne. The Liber Niger of 1165 contains no return by Ascelina de Wal tervill ; but I suspect it to have been her who is written as Ascelinus de Waltervill, and who held half a fee in Lincolnshire under Simon Earl of Northampton.4 Probably too it was her son who in one place is caUed Ralph de Waltervilla,5 and in another, Ralph fitz As celine,6 in the same Record, but who does not yet appear as a Tenant-in-capite. Between the years 1161 and 1172, I date the Deed whereby As celina de Waltervill (evidently a widow) and Radulf her son, con cede to Shrewsbury Abbey, a third of Crugelton and Slepe, as given previously by Hamo Peverel, &c.

He granted to Barnwell Priory the Church of Bertone in Ketstevene, but was deceased without issue before 1185. At his death his sisters became his heirs. These were MatUda, wife of William de Diva, and Ascelina, wife of * * * * de Torpel. Matilda, widow of WUbam de Diva and daughter of Walter de Geoffreyvill (as the Record by a curious transposition of names calls 1 *2 Read ita and unquam. 3 The late Mr. George Morris's Deeds. I 4.5.6 Ziber Niger, I. 271, 269 198. 7 Salop Chartulary, No. 31."], [99, "77 COHEIRS OF PEVEREL. her Father), was 35 years of age in 1185. She was then in the King's gift. The land of Corebi, held under the See of Lincoln, was her marriage portion (surely it was part of her inheritance) . She had in 1185 two sons and two daughters, of whom the heir was aged ten years.1 In her charter to BarnweU she, as Matildis de Diva, confirms her brother's gift of Bertone Church.2 In her grant of a third of Corby Church to Stanford Nunnery she names her father, Geoffrey de Waltervill, her maternal aunt (matertera) Ma tildis de Dovere, and her husband, William? She was living in 1202 or later. Her eldest son was named Hugh, but her second son, Ralph de Diva, continued the line. She had also a daughter, Matildis, wife of Wilbam fitz Otho. More of this descent I cannot here discuss. Ascelina, sister and coheir of Radulf de WaltervUl, was wife of * * * de Torpel. As Ascelina de Waltervill, she confirmed her brother Radulf's grant to BarnweU Priory.4 In her grants to Stamford Nunnery, about Corby Church, she names two of her sons, Geoffrey and Thomas : and one of the said Charters is attested by Roger de TorpeU and Radulph de Diva, \u2014 her eldest son and her nephew, as I take it. In 1 Richard I. (1189-90) Ascelina de Watervil (with assent of her son and heir Roger de Thorpel) and Matilda de Diva (with assent of her son and heir Hugh de Diva) made a grant in Eyleswrthe to Hugh de Longchamp, Nephew of WiUiam Bishop of Ely, the King's Chancellor.5 A Scutage-Roll of King John's reign calls this Lady Ascelinus de Waltervile, but couples her and her sister, Matilda de Diva, as together responsible on 9*^ fees in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire.

The said four-ninths, or rather, a reputed half of the Seigneury of Ercall, is found after a silence of about a century (1170 to 1270) to have been in Geoffrey de Gresley. There is no genealogy of the Gresleys, known to me, which wiU account for this ; nevertheless I cannot but think that this feudal right came to the said Geoffrey by inheritance. That Geoffrey de Gresley had it, the sole but sufficient proof is the fol lowing Deed, which must have passed between 1271 and 1274, that is, at the precise period when Robert Burnell acquired another moiety of this Seigneury from Gilbert Peche. \u2014 \" Geoffrey de Gresseleg, son and heir of Sir William de Gresse leg, grants to Sir Robert Burnell, Archdeacon of York, the homage and service of Sir John de Erkalewe, in which homage and service he (the said John) was bound to the Grantor, for one moiety of the Manor of Erkalewe.\"1 Geoffrey de Gresley's cotemporary certificate to the Tenant-in-fee may be given in brief as foUows. \u2014 Dilecto amico suo, Domino Johanni de Erkalwe, Galfridus de Gresseleg, salutem, fye.

It may serve as a starting-point for some future inquiry if I in dicate precisely who the above Geoffrey de Gresley was, besides be ing son of Sir WUliam. He was Lord of Drakelow (Derby shfre) and of Motton and Kingston (Staffordshire). He had been ac cused of disloyalty in the rebellion of 1264-5, and Thomas Corbet (of Hadley) had apparently obtained a grant of his estates, thus forfeited. In 1273 Corbet was endeavouring to force Geoffrey de Gresley to the usual composition (under the Dictum de Kenilworth), for lands in the aforesaid Manors. Gresley resisted, asserting that in the time of disturbance his loyalty had not been shaken. It was very possibly the expense, likely to be incurred at such a juncture, which prompted Gresley to seU his seigneury at High ErcaU to Archdeacon Burnel.

It may have been the act of William Peverel (II.) his kinsman, but I much prefer to consider it as the joint act of the said WUliam Peverel's coheirs, and to have taken place between 1155 and 1165. The Charters or Records which prove William de Hadley (II.) to have been enfeoffed in three thirds, that is in the whole, of the Manor, before 1165, have been already given. We have seen him, as William brother of Alan de Hadley, at testing WUliam fitz Alan's so called Foundation-Charter of Wom bridge Priory. We have seen him as William de Ercalew, granting a ninth of aU his tithable possessions to the same House.2 This was before 1181. His further grants to Wombridge (not being specified in the general Confirmations of King Henry II. and Pope Urban III. in 1181 and 1187) I take to have been later than 1187. They are partly combined in the foUowing Deed. \u2014 William de Hedlega grants for the health (of the souls) of him self, his ancestors, his father and mother, and his wife Sibil, that land of Schurlawe, which was then held by Turstan de Schurlawe, William his son, and Reiner nephew of Odo de Ercalewe, and bounded by au old ditch which separated the grant from the land of his men of Ercalwe.

Witnesses, Master Robert of Salopesbury, Pagan de Hedleg, Peter de Eyton, Ralph Panton, Alan de Hedleg, Richard his brother, Walter Chap lain of Ercalewe, Baldwin Wischart, and twenty others.3 The same William de Hedley is further said to have given to Wombridge the whole land of Podeford with all its appurtenances.4 Of the above witnesses I suspect that Pagan de Hadley was the 1 * 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 352, 364. and his Antecessors had been used to re ceive it\" (Monasticon, VI. 390).

The grant if it probably passed after 1187 certainly passed before 1197, when the first witness became Bishop of Bangor. The latest attestations which I can suppose to belong to William de Hadley (II.) alias William de ErcaU (I.) are involved in the foUowing combinations. \u2014 Between 1175 and 1180, Alan de Hadley, WUliam de Ercalew, and Pagan de Hadley (three brothers I think) attest a Charter already given under Tibberton.1 In the same interval Alan de Hadley's grant to Wombridge is attested by William de Ercalew and Payn his brother.2 About 1186-7, WiUiam de Ercalew, and Pagan de Hadley, with * * * * and Richard his nephews, attest a Charter given under Sutton Maddock.3 About 1188, William de Hedlega attests a Charter of Walter de Dunstanvill (I.)4; and about the same time Alan de Hadley is fol lowed by William de Ercalou in a Pimley Deed.6 That William de Hadley (II.) was living after these attestations would indicate, I infer from the fact that his son and heir, WUliam, was caUed in one instance juvenis, and in another, minor, between the years 1191 and 1197. Perhaps the latest notice we have of WUliam de Hadley (II.) is his suit with Richard de Leighton in December 1194,6 for no limit of age would preclude his name thus appearing. When he died I know not, for it is clear that at the close of his life his public functions devolved upon his heir, so en tirely as that the acting son is only distinguished from the super annuated father in the two exceptional instances above alluded to. William de Hadley (III.) otherwise William de Ercall (II.) must be taken to be that heir who consented to his Father's grant to Wombridge, but we have perhaps earlier notices of him than that. It is he who about 1189 (certainly between 1187 and 1191), as WUliam de Hedley, and with his brothers Alan, Hamund, and Richard, attests Roger Mu3sun's two Grants to Wombridge. It was he who as WUliam de Hadley acted as Deputy- Sheriff for William fitz Alan in the year ending Michaelmas 1191.

On the whole we at least have an early appearance of the son and heir of William de Hadley (III.) . It appears that, besides being Tenant of Bradford Mill, William de Hadley (III.) obtained from Griffin son of Gervas Gohc (then Lord of Rowton and EUerdine) such concessions as enabled him to make a Vivary and Mill on the little stream which divided Ercall from Rowton and EUerdine, and which was called Pendelat. The Mill and Vivary, when made, were called The Lake. This will ex plain the following Deed which passed between 1201 and 1216, probably about 1208. \u2014 Willielmus de Herkelawe dedi, fye.

However it is singular that the very interval which I should fix upon as distinguishing the public \u00e6ras of William de Hadley (III.) and William de Hadley (IV.) is occupied by one Hugh de Hadley, who (as we have seen1) attests a Deed between 1225 and 1227, and occupies a high position therein.

Now the Plaintiff concedes that the Priory shall have a ninth of all garbs and hay, arising from 3 carucates which he held in demesne at Erkalewe, and also a similar ninth from all lands in the said Manor which should be assarted by him or his heirs. The Prior renounced all right to his previous exactions of a ninth of the garbs and hay of the vill of Mora (now Moor-town), and of a ninth of the Plaintiff's movables. On November 15, 1248, a Fine was levied between Baldwin Prior of Wombridge, Plaintiff, and William de Ercalewe, Defor ciant, concerning a right of common asserted by the Prior in the Manor of Ercalwe. William now allows such right, for the Prior's own cattle at Shirlawe, and for the cattle of any of the Prior's men of Ercalewe, except in Heltesmore, which was only to be common between Martinmas (November 11) and the Purification (February 2) . In return the Prior renounced all right of common in WiUiam's Park, save for 3 oxen. In February 1249, the ninth Juror in a Bolas Inquest is written as Will, de Ercalowe Morvan. The individual was not the person I am treating of, but some one distinguished from him in this un intelligible way. In fact William de Hedleye himself presided over the Inquest as Escheator for Shropshire. In March 1253, the Abbot of Shrewsbury was suing William de Ercalew for disseizin in Ercalew. In 1255, the Jurors of Bradford Hundred reported the state of this Manor as follows. \u2014 \" WUbam de Hercalue holds Hercalue with its appurtenances by (service of) a third part2 of a knight's-fee, of the Fee of Hamo Pe verel.

Ercall had therefore lost 2^ hides of its Domesday area. The loss may be computed as Sleap and Crud gington (1| hides) and Tern (1 hide). At the Assizes of January 1256 WiUiam de Erkalue had four Lawsuits, real or fictitious, in hand. He was sued by Anora de Erkalewe and Cecilia her Sister in a Plea of Charter-Warranty, which was compounded by license, and for a Fine of 6s. 8d. The Cyrograph (which foUowed as a matter of course) is not preserved. Further, William de Erkalue had suits of novel disseizin with Henry Mauvesin, and with WUliam le Fraunceys (probably of Meeson), and a suit of Charter- Warranty with the Prioress of Bre wood. In these three Suits he names his son John as his Attorney, but I only find the result of the last. This is in the shape of a Fine levied at Shrewsbury on Feb. 3, 1256, between Agnes, Prioress of St. Leonard of Brewood, Plaintiff, and William de Ercalew, Impe dient (by Hamo fitz WUliam de Sholton, his Attorney) concerning a ninth of the garbs produced by two carucates of William's land in La More, and by one carucate in Erkalue, and a ninth of Wil liam's hay in Thyrne except the hay of Wrennesmore meadow,3 concerning aU which ninths, there was Plea of warranty, &c. Now William concedes the same as his gift to the Prioress. He further concedes a place at La More, where the Prioress's grauge was built. The Prioress in return vouchsafed the prayers and good offices of her House to the Grantor and his heirs. The Fine is indorsed with a memorandum that \u2014 \" The Prior of Wombridge opposes his claim.\" The above Fine is fully explained by a preceding or a concurrent Charter, which gives the name of William de ErcalFs wife. \u2014 \" WiUiam de Ercal, for the souls of himself and his wife, Emma, gives to St. Leonard and to the W hite Nuns of Brewode a ninth of 1 Ad auxilium Pr\u00e6positi, xviiid ; \u2014 ano ther term for Motfee (vide supra, Vol. I. p. 92, note 336). 3 Wrennemore meadow was apparently very extensive.

Neither he nor any of his descendants were called De Hadley. In the very year of his father's death John de Ercalew was presented as a Tenant of 15 Librates of land and not yet a knight. In the same year he fines one merk for some writ. On Sept. 14, 1256, John fitz Aser and Margery his wife are set down as having a suit of novel disseizin against John de Ercalew for a tenement in Suthleg.2 As far as I can judge from his attestation of Deeds, John de Ercall remained unknighted till 1266-7. However in August 1267 he appears with that dignity, but not in an otherwise creditable posi tion. King Henry III. was in that month presiding in his Curia at Shrewsbury, when Cecily, daughter of Sir William de Ercalue, came before the King and complained of Sir John de Ercalue her brother, who had threatened herself in life and bmb, and her house with burning. She asked the King's peace and the King gave it. So also did Robert de Blechel', William le Forester, and Hugh Clerk, obtain the King's peace in respect of the same Sir John.3 On May 12, 1267, John de Ercalewe had a grant of a weekly market (on Mondays) at Ercalewe, and also of an annual fair, to be held on the eve, day, and morrow of the nativity of the Virgin (Sept. 7, 8 and 9) .* On November 8, 1268, John de Ercalew is appointed to deliver Bridgnorth Gaol.

John de ErcaU, sometimes called Escheator, and sometimes Sub escheator, occurs in that office from November 1273 to February 1275. I presume that Shropshire only was his province. John, Lord of Ercalewe granted that the Wombridge Canons should take a ninth of all his corn and hay in all his lands at Er calewe, except in the land of La Mora, which he had bought from Hamo Pichard.2 As John, Lord of Erkelewe, he confirmed his Ancestors' Char ters, concerning 2 merks rent, payable to Haughmond Abbey for Bradford Mill.

He had succeeded to his inheritance as a Vassal ofthe coheirs of Peverel. He died a Vassal of Bishop Burnel. There is some probability that, at his death, his son and heir was in minority or at least un married, for he married a Burnel, viz. Petronilla a niece of the Bishop's, and their eldest son was born in December 1284.

Of the said members the Prior of Wombridge holds the vill of Scurlow in frank almoign under the aforesaid William ; and Thomas de Berewicke holds Wildislow of the aforesaid William.\" The Assize- Roll of October 1292 contains various entries about William de Ercall (IV.) . Under the heading De valettis he is pre sented as holding a knight's-fee and being of full age, but not a knight. As William, son of John de Erkalewe, he acknowledges a debt of 8 merks to John de la Mare. As William de Erkalewe he was presented as exercising free- warren in Erkalewe. Also it was presented how 3s. which had used to be received by the King, for stretward and motfee of the vill of Magna Ercalwe, till 30 years since, had been withdrawn : but WiUiam de Ercalwe, the present Tenant of the Vill, could not appear, he being in the Bishop's Prison as one convicted of felony : so the case was adjourned for the present. This brings us to another presentment among the Bradford Crown-Pleas. \u2014 It appears that Alice, Lady of Ercall,1 had had 15 swine in her keeping, for the purpose of fattening them. When fat, her Swine herd (porcarius) had driven them to Crugelton Bridge, where two men of William de Ercalwe came and seized them. To prove his complicity it was stated that the swine were afterwards slain by his order and put into his Larder. To this charge he appeared, and claimed his privilege as a Clerk. The Dean of Salop also demanded to have custody of him for the like reason. The Jurors in the Crown Court valued his lay-chattels at \u00a356. 5s.

Mr. Blakeway suggests that the Christian name of the individual in question should be either William or John. But the er ror is not merely in a Christian name. It is certain from the Pipe-Roll of 1291 that William de Titteley was Sheriff for the whole of the year in question. I sus pect that William de Hadley (the Sheriff of 1191) has been converted into Henry, and his \u00e6ra put a century too late in some list which Mr. Blakeway followed. 1 Widow, I presume, of John de Ercall. 2 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 187, 188."], [111, "89 HIGH ERCALL. in the restoration of William de Ercall's liberty and estate. William de Ercall's anomalous status is more than I can explain. A wealthy landholder, a married man, and pronounced to be in misericordid for not taking knighthood, he is also a Clerk, and had been desig nated, years before, as Dominus, by his wife's Uncle. I am much mistaken however if William de Ercall (IV.) did not actually be come a Knight before his death.1 In 1297, as holding lands or rents of \u00a320 yearly value, William de Ercalwe was summoned to be at London on July 7, prepared with horse and arms for foreign service. In 1301 he was similarly summoned to attend Muster at Berwick upon Tweed, on June 24, for military service against the Scots. On August 25, 1300, WiUiam Burnel, Provost of Wells (Prepo situs Wellensis) appoints two Attorneys to take seizin of a carucate in Erkalwe and of the rents, &c., issuing therefrom, in the vill of Walton, which he had by feoffment of Sir William de Erkalwe, knight.2 This Deed is dated at Eudon (Eudon Burnell). William Burnel is evidently a Feoffee-in-trust, and the nature of his trust will presently be apparent. Whereas William de Ercalewe held under Philip Burnel's heir, and that heir was in ward to the Crown, a Writ of Diem clausit, dated at St. Andrew's on February 20, 1304, announces these facts, and the death of William de Ercalewe. A Jury, which met at Wellington on March 15 following, found that the deceased had held the Manor of Ercal under Philip Burnel's heir, by service of Qd. rent. The Jury valued the Capital Messuage at nothing, four carucates of land (containing 60 acres each) at 40s., ten acres of meadow at 10s., 10 acres of bosc at lOd, a Dovecot at Qd., aWater Mill at 6s. 8c?., and the assized rents of free tenants at 7s. Qd. per annum. Besides this he and his wife Petronilla had held conjointly, by feoffment of Master William Burnel, a carucate of land and \u00a3Q. 5s. rent in ErcaU.3 Further the deceased had held 60s. rent at Parva Soutley under John, son of Roger le Strange, by service of Is. William, son and heir of the deceased, was 19 years of age on December 29, 1303. This Return being unsatisfactory, a second Writ of the King recites it in part, and inquires whether the deceased had held anything in capite, elsewhere than at Ercall, and whether the joint feoffment of which are quoted under High Ercall, without a specific reference. 1 See Vol. II. p. 55, note 25. 2 Abstract of Newport Evidences.

A Jury sitting at Ercall on April 16, 1304, answered the first question in the nega tive, the second in the affirmative.1 In the same year (1304) William, son of WUbam de Ercalew (though still a Minor), did fealty to the King for lands held at Er call under Philip Burnel's heir by service of Qd? One or two Deeds of William de Ercall (IV.) and his wife Petro nilla should be mentioned here. \u2014 Between the years 1284 and 1300 William de Ercal, for the souls' health of himself and his wife Petronilla, reiterates that grant of tithes, &c, to Brewood Nunnery, which we know to have origi nated with his Grandfather. Witnesses, Sir Robert Corbet, Sir William de Hodnet, Sir Thomas Corbet. Within the same period (1284-1300) William, Lord of Erkalue Magna, for the souls' health of himself, his wife Petronilla, and their children, gives to Sir Geoffrey de Wayinton, Chaplain, for life, and to his Successors after him, in free alms, half a virgate of land with a garden, croft, and other appurtenances, which William Henry formerly held of the Grantor, in the vill of Erkalewe. The object of this endowment was \" the celebration of certain Masses of the Virgin in the Church of St. Edward of Erkalue.\" The Grantee and his Successors were to have common-pasture throughout the Manor, save in the Grantor's enclosures, and certain allowances of wood, under view of the Grantor's Forester, and were to feed four swine in the forinsec bosc, without paying pannage. If the Grantee or his successors committed any crime, they were to be expelled, and another fit Priest appointed. Witnesses, Sir William de Hode net, Sir Thomas Corbet, Sir Peter de Eyton, Sir Nicholas, Vicar of Erkalewe. Petronilla Burnel, widow of William de Ercall (IV.), had, it seems, full benefit of the conjoint feoffment above mentioned. \u2014 As \" Dame Petronilla, Lady of Erkaluwe,\" she grants to John, son of Roger Bareson of Salop, and others, certain land in her waste of Ercaluwe, in the heath of Cottewalle. By another Deed she grants to John le Mercer of La More certain land of her w7aste above Brondecroft. This Deed had a lozenge-shaped seal, bearing the impress of a Buck 's-head, caboshed, and a motto on the margin. William de Ercall (V.) had livery, as I have intimated, in 1304, not being yet 20 years osage.

They had the said half by feoffment and gift of their own Tenant, William de Ercalewe ; to whom and to whose heirs it would revert on Alina's death. The value of the estate was \u00a38. 10s. per annum ; and it was now held under Edward Burnel's heirs by service of a sore sparrow-hawk.1 It is evident from this, that William de Ercall (V.) had had some transaction with his Suzerain which deprived him for a time of the fee-simple of half his estate. The Inquest is well supported by a French Deed which passed at Buildwas on October 15, 1315. Thereby Alyne, widow of Sir Edward Burnel, sells for a sum of money, to Sir Wylliam de Ercaluive, Chyvaler, all her goods and chattels in the manor of Grant Ercaluwe? In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, William de Ercalwe stands as sole Lord of the Vills of Ercalwe, Acton Reynald, and Grinshill, and as joint Lord of Millichope (a matter which has already been noticed).3 In 1322 the Arms of Sire William Arcalou are on the Roll of the Battle of Boroughbridge, viz. D'argent ove iii gemels de sable. In 1323 he was a Commissioner to levy Archers in the Counties of Salop and Stafford. In 1324 and 1325 he was twice returned to Parliament, as a Knight of the Shire, for Salop. In August 1325 he was named as one of the Conservators of the Peace, for the same County. To the Parliament summoned to meet at West minster on December 14, 1326, but prorogued to January 7, 1327, William de Ercalwe was again returned for Shropshire. He him self makes the return of the elections for Shropshire and Stafford shire, viz. as Sheriff of the two Counties.4 His tenure of the latter office is not supported by any other authority that I am aware of.5 The political confusion of the period possibly had something to do with this anomaly of a double Shrievalty. On October 3, 1331, King Edward III. orders an Inquest to be held as to a proposal by William de Ercalwe, viz. that he should bestow i\u20ac20 of annual rent in Ercalwe on six Chaplains, who were to perform services, &c, in the Chapel of AU Saints in the Cemetery 1 Inquisitions, 9 Edw.

The Return to this inquiry states that the project was not injurious to the Crown ;\u2014 that the premises, being one fourth of the Manor of Ercall, were held of John and Matilda de Handlo by service of a fourth part of Gd. rent or of a sparrow hawk.1 The above scheme was not carried out, and a second Inquest was ordered by Writ of August 2, 1334, as to the propriety of William de Ercalwe's endowing the same six Chaplains with a messuage, 6 acres of land, two acres of meadow, and certain rights of pasture and pannage. The return dated at WeUington, on September 1, 1334, was again favourable to the project. The Jurors now stated that William de Ercalwe's rent to \"John de Hawlowe, Lord of Acton Burnell,\" was a sore sparrow-hawk or 2s., and that 30 librates of land would remain to William de Ercalwe after the proposed endowment.2 The \u00e6ra of William de ErcaU (V.) was exactly that when the custom of dating Deeds first began to prevail. Consequently we find some of his Deeds undated and others dated. \u2014 As \" William, Lord of Magna Ercaluwe,\" he leases to Philip de Moclyton and his wife Alina, for the longest of their two lives, a parcel of land and pasture, taken out of his waste of Ercaluwe, at Smalthorns.

On the same day William de Ercalwe, by Deed dated at Ercalewe, sells to Robert de Ercalewe and Richard de Adbaston all his goods in his Manors of Ercalewe, Alvethemere, Brocton, Hopton-Wafre, and Southlye, in the County of Salop. By Fine levied at York on July 1, 1334, William de Ercalwe (Plaintiff) acknowledges himself to have granted, to the same two Trustees, the Manors of Alvithemere, Brocton, Hopton Wafre, Soule, and Ercalewe (except a messuage, 3 acres of land, and 20 librates of rent, in Ercalwe). The Trustees restore the premises to the Grantor, to hold for life under the Lords of the Fee ; with remainder to William de Careswell and his heirs, to hold in like manner. To this Fine \"Petronilla daughter of WTilliam de Er calwe opposed her claim.\" There can be little doubt that it was intended to, and did, work her disheritance. On February 14, 1339, William de Ercalewe, Chivaler, releases to Sir Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon, all actions, &c, from the be ginning of the world. This is dated at London, but a similar re lease bears date at Haghmon on February 28, 1339. After this I hear no more of William de Ercall (V.), unless the year 1344 were indeed the date of a Commission which empowers him, with other chief men of Shropshire, to raise levies in that County for foreign service.1 At his death, which must have taken place within the next two years, the Fine of 1334 came into opera tion, and \u2014 William de Caverswell took possession of Ercall. I know that this William de Caverswell was son and heir of that Richard de Caverswell who in 1309-10 had some negotiation with William de Ercall (V.). My full belief is, that the said Richard's wife, Joan, was another daughter of William de ErcaU (V.), and that she became, in her issue, his heir, to the exclusion of her sister Petronilla. On Richard de Caverswell's death, Joan seems to have become the second wife of Sir John de Chetwynd. Sne appears to have left issue by both husbands, but William de Caverswell was her immediate heir.2 1 Kennett's Parochial Antiq. p. 459. 2 This will satisfactorily account for what puzzled Erdeswick so much, viz. that Sir William de Caverswell's tomb was embellished with the arms of Ercall (Vide Erdeswick's Survey, Edn. 1814, p. 251)."], [117, "95 HIGH ERCALL.

This Deed is dated at Ercall, and sealed with Arms,\u2014 a Lion rampant. A Patent of April 6, 1347, recites Henry III.'s Charter of Market and Fair, to John de Erkelowe, and allows, although those privileges had not been exercised by the heirs of the said John, that William de Careswell, his Cousin (consanguineus) and heir, should now use them.1 Sir William de Cavereswell died on February 27, 1349. Great estates in Warwickshire which he had held for life, and ever since the decease of his wife, Mary, went to Joan de Langley, daughter of Geoffrey, son of Geoffrey de Langley, the first husband of the said Mary ; which Joan was now 17 years of age and wife of John, son of Alan, son of Sir Alan de Cherlton.2 .

On June 12, 1391, an Inquest was held at Shrewsbury, which found that it would be no injury to the Crown, if the King should allow Peter de Careswell and Mary his wife to enfeoff Thomas Newport, Parson of the Church of Eyton, and Thomas Corbet, Chaplain in the Manor of Ercalwe, so that the said Feoffees, being seized, should grant the same to the said Peter and Mary for their lives, with remainder to Thomas Gech and Isabel his wife and Thomas, son of the said Thomas Gech, and the heirs of the said Thomas Gech, \u2014 to hold of the King in capite. The Manor, said the Jurors, was held of the King for half a knight's-fee, and was worth \u00a310 per annum. Peter and Mary would still have 3 messuages and 3 carucates of land at Aldemere, held under the Lord Burnell, and worth 5 merks per annum? It seems strange that this Inquest should follow the Fine above quoted. I suppose that in fact it preceded it, and that the original documents involve some error of date. In 15 Richard II. (June 1391-June 1392), Thomas Gech, Isa bel his wife, and Thomas his son, demise to Peter de Cavereswall, knight, and Mary his wife, for their lives, a meadow called Wrennes more, with a right of road thereto. In 20 Richard II. (1396-7), the same demise to the same, certain lands which John Boyd and Alice his wife formerly held, by demise of the said Peter, in Cotwall and Great Ercalwe. This was for a term of 40 years, and at a rent of 8 merks payable to the Lessors.

He was deceased in 1401, and Thomas Newport, Esq., then of Ercall, was identical with Thomas Gech the younger. On June 27, 1402, with Margaret his wife, he obtained an Episcopal license, similar to that previously granted to his Father:2 and in 1403-4 he served as Sheriff of Shropshire. I have far overstepped my usual limits in order to introduce a name which continued pre-eminent in Shropshire History for more than three centuries. The estates of the Newports have constituted the largest tenure-in-fee which the County has known since Domes day. One word in conclusion as to their acquisition of Ercall. \u2014 They obtained it by purchase, says Leland; and the documents which I have quoted bear out the assertion. However, the New ports were a family of consequence before they acquired Ercall, and I am much mistaken if they had not some hereditary claims to the estate, independent of the money which passed. There are three grounds for this theory ; \u2014 first, because tradition asserts it, though with much inaccuracy as to the mode of the relationship ; secondly, because the Newports uniformly quartered the arms of Ercall ; and thirdly, because the muniments of the Ercalls, whether they related to Ercall or other estates, were afterwards held by the Newports. As to the Caverswells who came between the Ercalls and the Newports, it is probable that they were related to both families, but I have never been able to discover any absolute proof as to how Caverswell was so descended from Ercall as to be entitled his heir, as he undoubtedly was entitled, and that in an authentic docu ment.3 TERN. This must be taken as one of the Domesday -Berewicks of Ercall. Among the witnesses of Hamo Peverel's Charters, as early as 1134, and of the Charters of his heirs, as late as 1165, is Radulf de Tirna, or Radulf fitz Theald, or Radulf fitz Theold de Tirna. In his attestations of 1134-1136, this Radulf is usually accom^ panied by his brother, called Alanfitz Thebald or Alanfitz Theald. With the latter person I have nothing more to do. It is clear from the Liber Niger of 1165 that Radulf de Tern was then living, that his feoffment was old, that is of earlier date than 1135, and that it was a feoffment by service of one-fourth of a knight's-fee.

Reginald de Tern, successor to Radulf, was amerced 20s. for un just disseizin, in 1180. In 1194 he occurs as Surety, in a sum of three merks, for his neighbour Guy de Shawbury. The Pipe-Roll of 1202 names Reginald de Tirne and Wiomarus (probably Guomar de Rodinton) as Agistators of the Shropshire Forests, and as accountable for the proceeds of tlie pannage during several preceding years. At Assizes held in November 1208, and recorded in the Pipe- Roll of 1209, Reginald de Turne was found responsible for the sum of 31s. for the chattels of a Felon. He would therefore appear to have held some Bailiwick or provincial office under the Crown. The \u00e6ra of Reginald de Tirne (I.) is thus marked as from 1180 to 1208. I refer to his attestations of several Deeds during that in terval.1 Reginald de Tern had two sons, Radulf and Reginald. Radulf de Tern (II.) occurs on an Inquest of 1220, and with his brother Reginald attests a Charter already given under Eaton.2 In 1227 (as we have seen3) Radulf de Tern had come to some agree ment with William de Hedley which necessitated a quitclaim on the part of Reginald, his (Radulf s) brother, who had .probably some tenant interest in the matter. I shall say more of this Regi nald presently. Radulf de Tern (II.) was succeeded by his son and heir, William de Tern, whose \u00e6ra and position are ascertained by the following documents. \u2014 In the year 1237, William de Tyrne for a sum of 14s. leases for a term of 25 years his meadow called Le Pleches, near the meadow called Wulfwyeseie. The Lessees are William Culbel of Osbaston, and Hamo Dulthac of Walton, his brother.

In 1251 we first hear of the Abbot of Lilleshall having acquired a footing in Tern, for it seems that he had levelled a stank there, to the injury of the Abbot of Buildwas.3 These conflicting interests are ex plained by the Hundred-Roll of 1255, which states that \u2014 \" William, Lord of Tirne, used to hold (tenuit) Tirne, of Gilbert Peche * by service of one-fourth of a knight's-fee ; and the same William gave in free alms to the Abbot of Lilleshull the whole vill of Tirne, with all homages, rents, and appurtenances belonging to the said vill, except a virgate of land which Cecilia de Kent is holding of the Abbot of Buildwas, at a rent of 4d. And the vitiate of Tirne is one hide ; and pays 8d. for motfee, and does suit to County and Hundred.\"5 This Record presumes transactions which were not as yet com plete: for the Assize-RoU of January 1256 exhibits William de Tirne as fining half a merk, for leave to compound a plea of Char ter-warranty with the Abbot of LUleshuU.6 The Fine, which fol lowed on February 9th, is preserved. Thereby William de Tirne (Impedient) acknowledges himself to have given to Ralph, Abbot of Lilleshull (Plaintiff), a virgate in Tyrne (whereof was plea of charter-warranty). The Abbot is to pay Gd. rent, to William and his heirs, and to perform all forinsec services. He also undertakes or whether he had acquired the whole mesne-lordship of Tern, I am ignorant or doubtful. 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 113. 2 Ibidem, No. 114. 3 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 235. * Gilbert Peche was one of the Coheirs of Peverel (vide supra, p. 73) ; but how 5 Rot.

At these same Assizes of 1256, a quarrel between the Abbots of Shrewsbury and Lilleshull came to an issue. The Abbot of Lilles hull was complained of, as having erected a stank in Tirne, thereby injuring the Abbot of Shrewsbury's tenement. The Defendant got a quietus on the ground that if any such injury had been done, it was in the time of Abbot Richard his predecessor. The latter we know died in 1253. We have seen that William, son of William de Tern, was, as early as 1250, a Coparcener in Waters Upton. I think he acquired this with his wife Agnes. Notwithstanding his grant to Lilleshall Abbey, he seems to have maintained the position of a landowner long after. It was perhaps he who as William de Tyrne appears as a Regarder of the Forest in 1262, and who, as William de Tyerne, was responsible for a fine of half a merk, for contempt. Afterwards, in 1274 and 1283, it is perhaps he who is called William de Upton; and in 1283, we have seen a William de Tyrne of Opton occurring with a coheiress for his wife, but she is called Agatha.1 Lastly we have seen that William de Upton with a wife Agnes had a share of Waters Upton in 1292.3 I now return to say something more of Reginald, second son of Reginald de Tern. It is he who attests in or about 1223, and oc curs in 1227. It is probably he who attests in 1234 and who occurs on a Leegomery Inquest in 1249. There was also a Reginald de Tern living in or after the year 1256. But meantime, that is in 1250, Reginald's son, called Reginald de Upton, had acquired a share of Waters Upton, probably by marriage. The appearance that his son, whom I will call Reginald (III.), was deceased in 1255, and had been succeeded by a son (called William fitz Regi nald in the Hundred-Roll of that year) is, I think, delusive. For William fitz Reginald of the Record, I should read Reginald fitz Reginald; which would make Reginald (III.) to be the person meant. In proof of the error of the Hundred-Roll I would observe that no other document mentions any William fitz Reginald, but that an Ercall Deed of 1271 is attested by Reginald de Terne, who would therefore seem to be living sixteen years after the date of the Hun dred-Roll. The difficulties of this descent have been already stated under 1 \u25a0 2 Supra, Vol. VIII. pp. 56, 57."], [125, "TERN 101 Waters Upton. There were other members of this family, of whom I can give no satisfactory account, for instance, \u2014 a Bolas Inquest of 1249 was attended by one Radulf de Tirne, and Richard de Tirne is a witness of an Ercall Deed in 1271.1 I proceed to give a few notes of Tern as divided between the three Abbeys of Lilleshull, Shrewsbury, and Buildwas. Lilleshall Fee. On November 29, 1265, King Henry III., confirming the acquisitions of Lilleshull Abbey, includes \" the dona tion and concession which William de Tyrne did make thereto, of the vill of Tyrne with its appurtenances.\" The Feodary of 1284-5 says that \" the Abbot of Lilleshill holds the vill of Tierne in free alms and by confirmatory Charter of King Henry III.\" The Taxa tion of 1291 gives the Abbot of Lilleshull as having \u00a31 assized rent in Time.3 At the Assizes of 1292, the Abbot acknowledged his obligation to pay 8d. for the stretward and motfee of Tern. He had further to pay \u00a31. Is. 4d., or 32 years' arrears of the same. A List of Crown-dues in the Abbey Chartulary includes this item, adding that the Vill itself was to discharge the same. The Valor of 1535-6 masses the Abbot of LilleshalPs receipts from Tern with those from Longdon and Coldhatton. The whole amounted to j\u00a316 per annum ; but inasmuch as Lilleshall now leased the Buildwas estates at Longdon and Tern, at a fee-farm rent of \u00a34. 3s. 4d., the net receipts of LilleshaU must be put at \u00a311. 16s. Sd? Buildwas Abbey Fee. There is apparently no Record as to how Buildwas acquired its virgate at Tern. It was possessed there of before the year 1251, when, as we have seen, it had a quarrel with Lilleshull about a stank, destroyed by the latter. Nor was this their only quarrel, for on January 30, 1251, Sir Robert de Grendon, then Sheriff, held an Inquest, pursuant to a King's Writ, which set forth a complaint by the Abbot of Buildwas, viz. that the Abbot of Lilleshull had erected a Mill in Suggedon, injuriously to the Abbot of Buildwas's tenement in Tyrne. The Jury found that the Abbot of LilleshuU's MiU had not been erected in Sugge don, but in his own tenement of Longedon.4 In 1255, Buildwas only received 4d. rent for its virgate at Tern;6 but in 1291, its receipts had increased to \u00a32. 13s. 4d?

SLEAP AND CRUDGINGTON. The mode in which these two members of Ercall came into the possession of Shrewsbury Abbey has been already described. On January 7, 1228, the King appoints WUliam Pantun (of Hales) and others to try an Assize of novel- disseizin between the Abbot of Salop and Hugh fitz Robert concerning common-pasture in Crugeleston and Merston (Meeson). The Franktons of Welch Frankton seem to have been Tenants of Shrewsbury Abbey at Crudgington. Hence the following Deeds in the Salop Chartulary.- \u2014 \u25a0 About 1236-40, \" Agnes, Relict of Reyner de Francheton con cedes to the Abbey, for 10s., all that share of the land which her husband had held under the Abbey at Crugelton, that share namely which belonged to her in the name of dower.

Buttery), to be members of the Abbot's Manor of Slepe. The Taxation of 1291, probably includes those places when it gives \u00a310. 17s.

I have described the mode in which it passed to Wombridge Priory,3 but the Deeds which should relate to the locality are missing in the Chartulary of that House. In 1251, the Prior of Wombridge was suing the Abbot of Salop for disseizing him of a tenement in Cruggelton.4 - I presume that Crudgington and Shurlow were adjoining vills. John Lord of Ercall (1256-1278) gave to Wombridge Priory a piece of cultivated land lying between the White stone and the green way which led towards ErcaU.5 Between the years 1284 and 1304, \"William, Lord of Ercalwe, son and heir of Sir John de Ercalwe, aUowed that the Canons of Wombridge might ' improve their waste ' at Shirlowe, in the Manor of Ercalwe.\"5 The Taxation of 1291 values a carucate at Surlowe, among the estates of Wombridge Priory, at 12s. per annum.

WILSITHLAND. This member of High Ercall is also lost. So too is that part of the Wombridge Chartulary which should aid us in making out its history. Edward II.'s Confirmation to Wombridge, speaks of \" William de Hedleg having conceded to the Priory all his moor under the Vivary of WUsithelond as it was bounded by a ditch.\" The Grantor was probably either William de Hadley (III.) or William de Hadley (IV.). From the same authority we learn how \" William Wiscart, son of Baldwin Wiscart, gave to Wombridge a virgate of land in Wil sidelond, with its appurtenances and meadows, and with common pasture for all the Prior's live stock at Shurlowe in the whole te nement of Wilsidelond, and with free pasture, for all the Prior's oxen at Shurlowe, throughout the Grantor's fenced lands, in his whole tenement of Wilsidelond, both in meadows and in any other pastures.\" Another grant by \" WUliam Wiscart\" to the Priory was of 3 acres in WUsidelond.2 This William Wiscart was Lord of Cold Hatton in the middle of the 13th century. He doubtless held the whole or part of WUsithland under the Ercalls. We have seen that in 1255 Ysonda de Wilfichelond was spoken of as having granted something in Ercall Manor to Wombridge Priory.3 She too, I suppose, was a Tenant here. An entry on the Assize-RoU of 1256 will indicate the situation of WUsithland as South-west of ErcaU. A Plaintiff (whom the Re- cord omits to name) sued WUliam de Arkelewe and five others for levelling a stank in Rodenhurst, to the injury of the Plaintiff's tenement in Wylsithelond. The Plaintiff when the stank existed, had been able, from the flow of water over the said stank, to have a free fishery there, and to take luces (pike), bream, and other fishes at pleasure. William de Arkelewe was ordered to restore the stank at his own cost and to pay 2s. damages. It would seem that Henry Malvoisin of Ashfield and Berwick, living from 1231 to 1256, had held WUsithland under the Ercalls. At his death he left, besides his two sons already4 mentioned (viz. Thomas and Philip), an elder son, Henry. This son, Henry, be- 1 Monasticon, Vol. VI. p. 391. a Monasticon, Vol. VI. 390. IX. I 3 Supra, page 85.

Wishing on his deathbed to advance his younger brother, Philip, he enfeoffed him in WUsithland. Soon afterwards Henry Mauveisin (II.) died, by the said fall and left no issue. On his death, John de Ercalew, as Seigneural Lord, seized on Wilsithlond, and then rendered it up to Thomas Malvoisin, as brother and next heir to Henry. In June 1272 Philip Mauveisin takes out a writ of disseizin, against Thomas Mauveisin, for a tenement in Wilselond, but in July the Writ is amended by one against Thomas Mauveisin, and others. The cause was tried at the Assizes of October 1272, when Thomas Mauveysin, John de Erkelewe and three others appeared to defend their having disseized Philip Mauveysin of two-thirds of a messuage and carucate in Wilsidelond. \u2014 The facts of the case I have given above, as the Jury found them. It was true that Henry Mauveysin had enfeoffed Philip, and so had not died seized of the premises. It was also true that Philip had begun to plough the land when John de Ercalewe disseized him ; but PhUip took nothing, \" because he had had no esplees from the land, and because he had been enfeoffed by a Minor.\"1 We have seen that Thomas de Berwick continued to hold WUsithland in 1285.3 Osbaston. Hamund Pichard, who probably held this vill and Moor -town under the Ercalls, gave, as we have seen, a forndell in Hosberton to Wombridge Priory.3 This was before 1181. In 1187 Pope Urban's Bull confirms it as a virgate in Osberneston, given by Hamund Pichart. In 1256 William le Franceys (probably the Prior of Wombridge's Tenant in Osbaston) was at issue with WiUiam de Ercalewe. Between 1256 and 1278 the above virgate in Osbaston was held under Wombridge Priory by Richard de Loskesford and John de Espelsy, but the Priory gave it to Sir John de Ercall in exchange for something elsewhere. We have seen that Shrewsbury Abbey had 4 acres of land in Ercall and aright of common at Osberneston.4 Between 1272 and 1278, Luke Abbot of Shrewsbury gave to Sir John de Ercalewe, knight, all the land which the Abbey had in Er calewe, viz. 4 nokes, exclusive of one noke held by William Suter. In return the said Knight gave to the Abbey that virgate in Osber neston which he had acquired from Wombridge Priory. He also 1 Assizes, 56 Hen. III., m. 2, dorso. 5 Supra, page 88.

He allowed also free-passage through his land, for the Abbot's men to carry grain and hay to Osberneston.1 Soon after this, Abbot Luke concedes, to the same Sir John, William Sutor's noke in Ercall, and also gave Sir John a license and faculty to petition the Convent of Shrewsbury concerning the admission of a certain Chaplain to the office of Sacristan in their Church of ErcaU. Witnesses, Sir Odo de Hodnet, Sir John fitz Aer, Sir John fitz Hugh, knights.2 The only Rent- Roll which gives the Abbot of Shrewsbury's re ceipts from Osbaston as distinct from Sleap and Crudgington is that of 1490.

When John de Ercall's Deed (later than 1256) exempts the land from this tithe he states himself to have bought it from Hamo Pichard;4 but I suspect that it was one of his ancestors who had so bought it. In 1269 William de Hales and Cecilia his wife were suing John de Erkalewe for disseizing them of a tenement in La More. Cecilia was pro bably that Sister of John de Erkalewe who had complained to the King of his violent conduct in 1267. The Valor of 1535-6 gives the Prioress of White Ladies 6s.

St. Michael is now assigned as the Patron Saint of Ercall Church, on what autho rity I know not, save that it is not on the authority of ancient Records. Domesday gives no indication of the existence of any Church at Ercall. I have explained this under Rodington, where the Mother Church of the district probably stood in 1086. However the supre macy was transferred to Ercall within eight years of that date; for Earl Roger himself gave the \" Church of Archeloua with all things pertaining thereto,\" to Shrewsbury Abbey, and the Earl died in 1093-4. The Charter of William Rufus confirmed this grant as that of the Church of Ercalow, and it had the uniform sanction of his Royal Successors. Earl Hugh, as I have explained, granted two-thirds of the tithes of his demesne of Ercalou to Shrewsbury Abbey. He added the same proportion of the tithes of Heitona. Now Heitona is identical with Cold Hatton, which had been Gerard de Tornai's at Domesday. I infer that the Earl granted these tithes while Gerard de Tornai's estates were an Escheat, and not yet granted to Hamo Peverel. The latter Baron is however said to have granted the tithes of his demesnes of Arkalou, Heiton, Wil sitheland, Sleap, and Crugelton to the Abbey. As usual I test these discordant statements by the express words of Bishop Clinton's Charter, which passed within 50 years of Earl Hugh's death. \u2014 An extract will suffice. Omnibus fye.

Another Charter of Bishop Clinton's to Shrewsbury Abbey con firms the \" Church of Archalou, with its Chapels, and a pension of 20s.\"2 Bishop Durdent's Confirmation is still more exact. It en sures the Church of Archalou, with the tithe of that Manor, and with the tithe of Wiscard's land, and the tithe of Rodintone, and with the Chapels pertaining to the same Church.3 Bishop Peche's Confirmation enumerates two-thirds of the demesne-tithes of Erka lou, Hetton, and Wilsithelond, as granted by others to Shrewsbury 1 \u2022 2 * 3 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 325, 328, 327."], [133, "109 THE CHURCH.

Up to his time the constitution of the Church was almost Collegiate, for it had a resident Rector and Vicar, whose incomes were portionary. Bishop Stavensby's Charter of Appropriation begins with the hypocritical pleas usual to such occasions. He finds that the Church-patronage of the Abbey has hitherto been rather a burden than an advantage to itself. He re serves the rights of Nicholas, then Rector of Ercall, till he should die, or resign. The Vicarage, endowed with 15 merks per annum, was so to remain, and Alexander, the present Vicar, was to hold it for his life. The Vicar was to bear all Church burdens, as at pre sent, except the Abbot's Procuration, which henceforth the Abbot was to provide himself.

June, in the 5th year of Bishop Alexander's pontificate. This date is equivalent to May 26, 1228, and is therefore erroneous.3 The real date of the Deed was probably May 26, 1229, and so in the 6th year of Bishop Alexander. W.

Witnesses, Master Thomas de Wymundham, Pr\u00e6centor of Lichfield ; Master R. de Gloucester, Treasurer of Lichfield ; Master W. de Luceby, Archdeacon of Derby.4 In this same year (1246), the Abbot of Shrewsbury had a dispute with the Prior of Wombridge as to the small tithes of the Prior's demesne at Schurlawe, valued at 3s., and claimed by the Abbot. A rescript of Pope Innocent IV. dated May 25, 1246, bore on the matter. At length on May 9, 1247, the Prior quitclaimed two-thirds of the said small-tithes, and agreed verting to the fact that the 6th year of the Bishop's pontificate had set in on April 14th, 1229, the date of his consecration being April 14, 1224. 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 329. 2 Lichfield Register, A. fo. 7, b. 3 The Writer of the Confirmation pro bably had the Bishop's Charter before him, and followed it too closely, not ad- 4 Salop Chartulary, No. 69."], [134, "110 HIGH ERCALL. to pay the Abbot 18d. yearly in lieu thereof.1 Ten years after this period the tithes of Ercall Parish must have been divisible in a most complex way. The great and small tithes of the whole Parish (ex cept demesnes) went to the Abbot of Shrewsbury, as Rector, after the Vicar's Portion of 15 merks had been satisfied. As to de mesnes they were doubly tithable ; that is liable to pay two-tenths of their whole produce. One of these tenths was subdivided as fol lows. The Abbot of Shrewsbury took two- thirds thereof, in virtue ofthe arbitrary consecration by Earl Hugh. The remaining third he took also, as Impropriate Rector of Ercall Church. The other tenth of demesne-tithes was of course a ninth of tlie residuary pro duce. That, as we have seen, was subdivided between the Prior of Wombridge and the Prioress of Brewood, the title of each arising by arbitrary consecration of the Lords of Ercall. Such will have been the general rule of division, but, in the case of Shurlow, it is not easy to see why Shrewsbury Abbey claimed only two-thfrds of the small-tithes of its demesne. Perhaps the remaining third, originally belonging to the Parish Church, was now annexed to the Vicarage. On August 17, 1280, Archbishop Peckham, having visited this Diocese as Metropolitan, and examined the Charters of Shrewsbury Abbey, found, and approved of, Earl Roger's original grant of Ercall Church, Bishop Stavensby's appropriation thereof, the confirmations of the Chapters of Lichfield and Coventry, and lastly of a Bull of Pope Gregory IX. (1227-1241) sanctioning the same appropriation.3 The Abbot's title to a pension of 20s. from Ercall Church, though formally sanctioned in the Archbishop's Charter, was probably represented by a different sum payable by the Vicar. In the Taxation of 1291 the Church of Ercalwe (in the Deanery of Salop) is valued at \u00a320. This was I suppose the Rectory. The Vicarage was apparently untaxed, as not liable to Tenths, except that a sum of \u00a31. 4s., receivable therefrom by the Abbot of Shrewsbury, is stated to be thus liable.3 On April 19, 1324, Johanna and Matildis, daughters of Roger le Archer of Slope (Sleap), grant to Sir Richard de Adbaston, Chap lain, and his successors, for celebration of the Mass of the blessed Mary in the Church of Ercalewe, for the souls' health of Roger and Cecilia, -father and mother of the Grantresses, an acre in the field of Crugelton.

Sd., for the Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb, now to be levied in the Parish. Their reasons for the reduction were because the Chapels of Rodington and Upton Parva (Waters Upton), were now separated from the Mother Church, and assessed as distinct Parishes to the current tax; \u2014 also because the small tithes and other income of Ercall Church were worth \u00a310 per annum, that is, constituted \u00a310 of the Church Taxation, but were not to be com- puted as an index of the value of the Ninth.

So also shall I have to discourse on the origin of the Town of Newport ;\u2014 a Nor man foundation in this same Manor of Edgmond. Edgmond with aU its appurtenances, Saxon and Norman, came to the hands of King Henry II. as a Manor of Royal-defnesne, whose fiscal value was in the proportion of \u00a312. 2s. Sd. to .\u20ac265. 15s. ; \u2014 the latter being the gross value of that Firma Comitatus for which the Sheriff was annually responsible at the Exchequer. About Midsummer 1165, Whittington Castle was surrendered to the Crown by Geoffrey de Vere, its previous Lord. The King in lieu thereof granted a charge of .\u20ac12 per annum on Edgmond to Geoffrey de Vere. The Sheriff paid \u00a33 of this charge at Michael mas 1165, \u00a312 at Michaelmas 1166, \u00a312 at Michaelmas 1167, and so every year till 1170 inclusive. Then, in consequence I presume of Geoffrey de Vere's death, the payment was discontinued. No further charge on the reputed revenue of Edgmond appears on the Pipe-Rolls till the year 1177. Then began those joint charges on the Manors of Edgmond and Wellington which lasted till 1194, the amount and recipients of which have been set forth under Wel lington. Meanwhile the Pipe-Roll of 1193 shows a charge on Edgmond to have been renewed by a Writ of King Richard in favour of Henry de Vere : and at the same time an annuity of \u00a314 had been similarly ordered for a second Geoffrey de Vere, ad se sus tentandum in servitio Regis. Nothing was said about Whittington in either case. Of Henry de Vere's annuity or charge on Edgmond, he only received \u00a33, or one quarter's instalment. At Easter 1194, Edgmond was again farmed by the Sheriff and its revenues paid into the Exchequer. This continued till 1209, ex cept that in 1198, 1199, and 1200, certain charges, already speci fied,1 were made by the Sheriff for the deficient stock which he found on the Manors of Wellington and Edgmond, and except that from 1202 to 1209, Edgmond was one of the Manors which exhi bited a similar deficiency.2 Meantime, that is, on February 2, 1206, King John, being at Nottingham, granted all Edwyney (Adeney), a member of his Manor of Egemenden in pure alms, to the Abbot and Convent of Croxden (Staffordshire). The grant was in lieu of an annuity of 100s. which the Monks had previously received as Royal Alms at the Exchequer. The King's Charter was witnessed, among others, by Hugh Pantulf.3 The fiscal value of Adeney was 1 Supra, page 41. 2 Supra, Vol. III. p. 68. 3 Rot. Chartarum, p. 162."], [142, "116 EDGMOND. \u00a32. 2s. 80?. The King's grant therefore reduced the fiscal value of Edgmond to \u00a310. This change is not noticed on the Pipe- Rolls till 1209. Then the Sheriff discharges his liabUities of a sum of \u00a38. 10s. Sd., or four years' reputed revenue of \" Edwiney, given to the Monks of Crokesden, by Writ Royal.\" Edgmond itself continued virtually to contribute its annual \u00a310 to the Firma Comitatus till 1217 inclusive. In that or the next year King Henry III. assigned this revenue to Henry de Audley, \" where with to support him in the Royal service, and during the Royal pleasure.\" Hence, at Michaelmas 1220, the Sheriff discharges his liabilities of \u00a330, or three previous years of the revenue of Egmen don.1 From 1221 to 1225, Henry de Audley enjoyed the full an nual income of \u00a310 from Edgmond.2 He also had 50s. for a quarter of the next fiscal year ; but three quarters' revenue due Michaelmas 1226, was accounted for by the Sheriff at the Exchequer, Edgmond having been for that period in manu Regis. On January 1, 1227, the King commits the Manor of New Borough, cum pertinentiis, to Henry de Audley ad se sustentandum in servitio Regis, and pending the King's pleasure ;3 but on July 22, 1227, the King, by Charter, dated at Westminster, grants the Manor of Egmundon cum Novo Burgo to Henry de Audley and his heirs, to hold of the Crown, by the service of one sore sparrow-hawk, payable yearly at the Exche quer.4 A Writ-Close of February 17, 1228, informs the Barons of the Exchequer of this grant. Meanwhile the full effect of the above Charter is seen on the Pipe-Roll of 1227. \u2014 First, the Sheriff as signs \u00a310 in Egmendon to Henry de Audley ad se sustentandum, as before, but the entry is interlined and corrected, by a statement that Audley had the Manor by Royal gift, to him and his heirs, and would answer for the ferm thereof himself. Below, on the same Roll, \" Henry de Aldithele accounts one mewed sparrow-hawk for the ferm of Egmendon cum Novo Burgo, according as the King had given the Manor to him at such a ferm. The hawk had been paid to the King himself; and Audley was Quit.\" Thus did the Audleys become Lords of Edgmond and Newport. The Sheriffs continued for ages to discharge their own account of 1 The reason why Henry de Audley's tenure of Edgmond had not been annually entered was that he himself was Sheriff and had a large current account with the Crown. port were seized into the King's hand for a short period in 1224; but a Writ of April 30 in that year restored them to Audley (Claus.

Having given the succession of the Barons Audley, under Ford, I need not repeat it here. Then- deabngs with Edgmond and New port wiU appear in due course. As to the King's Tallages assessable on Edgmond and Newport, I may refer to a former Table, which wiU show that they ceased in 1223 j1\u2014 that is, while Henry de Aud ley's tenure of the Manor was only conditional. I now turn to other details in the history of Edgmond. On October 13, 1200, a cause pending at Westminster between King John and the Abbot of Lilleshull was adjourned to the hearing of Justices-in-Eyre. The Abbot had made pourpresture on land and wood in Egemendon; and the Recognizors who had been em panelled were unfit to try a cause to which the King was a party.3 The Sheriff was ordered to empanel knights and gentlemen (pro bos homines) to try the cause.3 A renewal of this suit has perhaps appeared already,4 though different terms are employed, as was usual in questions of boundary. Perhaps the Sequel is embodied in the following extract from the Assize-Roll of 1203.\u2014 I should first observe that Edgmond and Newport were repre sented at the Assizes, each by its own community. This was be cause they were extra-hundredal, and \" kept their own Pleas of the Crown,\" as the term was. At these Assizes then, the Jurors of Egmendun said that the Abbot of Lillishul had made pourpresture in a spot where the King's men of Egmendun were wont to have pasture and easements. It was decided that there was no pourpres ture, and the Jurors were in misericordid. On the Amercement- RoU of the same Assizes I find several persons fined 6s. Sd. each pro salso dicto. William de Hales, Nicholas de Eston, Reginald de Egemund, Garnegoc, Robert de Hales, and Henry de Ponte, follow each other in this predicament.5 They were, I think, the Edgmond Jurors. At the Assizes of 1221 the Vill of Egemundun was represented by twelve Jurors. Their only presentment was a case of murder. At the Inquisitions of Hundreds, in 1255, twelve Jurors gave ac count of the joint Manor of Edgmond and Newport.6 They were Stephen de Pessal, Rayner le Taylur, Nicholas le Pulleyn, Nicholas 3 Placita, 2 John, m. 1, dorso. 4 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 230. 5 Assize-Roll, 6 John, m. 6 dorso.

Ase, Henry de Bedeford, Hugh le Palmer, Walter Provost, Richard Siward, Robert de Pickstoke, John de Aston, Philip de Aston, and Robert de Hales. They recalled the former Royal status of the Manors of Egmundon and Novus Burgus, the grant thereof to Henry de Audley (for a rent of a mewed sparrow-hawk), and the existing tenure of James de Audley. They valued the Vill and Mill of Newport at 20 merks, and the Manor of Edgmond at \u00a37. 19s. Qd. per annum. Both communities paid tallage (to the Lord), whenever there was a Tallage on the King's Boroughs and Manors. The Tallage of Newport was 36 merks, that of Edgmond 50 merks. Henry de Audley had made a Mill at Brademore, in Edgmond Manor, and broken up 4 acres of waste there. The Mill paid 2 merks per annum.1 At the Assizes of January 1256 the Manor of Egemundon ap peared by its Bailiff, John de Hauckeston, and the following Jurors, viz. Stephen de Pessehal, Ranulf Cissor, Nicholas Pullus, Nicholas fitz Alexander, William de la Venel, Richard Syward, Robert de Pickstock, Robert de Hales, Richard Strut, Adam le Paumer, Philip and John de Eston. At these Assizes James de Audley un dertook to restore to John de Chetwynd and his heirs certain heath land in Chetwynd, and common-pasture in Edgmond. There was also a Perambulation between Audley's land in Aston, and Chet wynd's land in Slatton. Brian de Brompton conducted it. The ditch of Geoffrey de Thorp and the Cross of Robert de Stockton were among the landmarks. At the Assizes of October 1272 the Manor of Edgmond and Borough of Newburgh appeared by a Chief Bailiff, Nicholas Ran dolf, and twelve Jurors, viz. Ranulf Tynctor, Robert de Pykestock, Alexander de Aula, Adam Marescall, Eobert de Aula, Richard fitz Walter, William fitz Ranulph, Philip Jarnegod, Richard Hancok, John de Hales, Adam le Provost, and Benedict de Adeney. In November 1274 twelve Jurors made Inquest as to the state of the same Liberty.2 Their names were, Alexander de Aula, Nicholas Roundulf, John le Porcher, William Day, Saunder de Mere, Wil liam Noblet, Walter del Hale, Richard Seward, Robert and Roger de Pykestock (written Sykestock), Robert fitz Walter, and Richard de Hoston (probably Haston). These Jurors told the history of their Manor and Borough, substantively as I have given it, but 1 The Bradford Jurors also presented this Mill, apparently as a pourpresture on the Forest, and combined with an as- sart of 3J acres of Forest land (Rot.

They particularized King John's grant of Adeney to Croxden Abbey, and Henry III.'s feoffment of the Audleys, of whom four had now held the Manor, viz. Henry, James (I.), James (IL), and Henry (II.) , (the existing Owner). The latter had franchises, allowed by the King, and he used them in a fitting and good manner. Newport was held under Audley by the free service of its Burgesses, Edgmond by the service of its Bonds.1 The Jurors complained of various ex tortions in their Liberty by Hugh de Mortimer, when Sheriff, by John Baril (Undersheriff), by William le Child, Bailiff of Bradford Hundred, by Elyas de Stoke, by Brian (read Urian) de St. Pierre, when Sheriff, by Elyas de Birkewey, his Receiver, and by William Snel, Under-Bailiff of Bradford Hundred. On the death of Sir James de Audley (I.), Peter Melysaunt, Clerk to Sir John fitz Aer, then Subescheator, seized Edgmond and Newport in manu Regis, and on that pretext took 4s. from Edgmond and 6s. 8d. from New port for his own uses.3 Again, on the death of James de Audley (II. ), that is, on November 11, 1272, John de Ercalue, Subescheator, seized the lands of the deceased, and held them till April 29, 1273, receiving all the issues. From the vUl of Newburgh he took 20s. for his own uses. My former account of the Audleys wiU explain the following extracts from the Inquests taken at their deaths. \u2014 Henry de Audley (II.) dying in 1276, was seized of two-thirds of Newburgh, and was responsible for two-thirds only of the Crown rent (the Sparrow- Hawk). The value of these two-thirds was \u00a311, according to one Inquest, and \u00a318 according to another.3 Matilda, widow of James de Audley (II.) , dying soon after Henry de Audley, had one-third of Ford and two-thirds of Edgmond ; \u2014 together valued at \u00a36. 2s. 9d. WUliam de Audley, deceased in December 1282, had all Edgmond, except his Mother's dower. His receipts were \u00a35. 18s. O^d., and a pair of white gloves. His interest in Newport I reserve for its proper place. The Tenure-Roll of Bradford Hundred, taken about 1285, is very lucid on the subject of this Manor. \u2014 \" Nicholas de Audeley holds the Manor of Egemond with its members, viz. Adeney, Great Aston, Little Aston, Little Halis, Pickestoke, with the vill of New porte, of the King in capite, by Charter ;\u2014 rendering yearly a mewed sparrow-hawk in beu of all services. The said Manor was 3 InquisitLones postmortem, 4 Edw. I., No. 50 ; and 6 Edw. I., No. 46. 1 Bonds, i.e. Tenants-in-Villeinage. 2 Compare Vol. VII. p. 188.

Of the said members William Eysseby holds Great Aston of the said Nicholas; the Abbot of Crokesden holds Adeney; John de Halis holds Little Halis ; and the Burgesses of Neuport hold Neuport, as a free borough, of the said Nicholas. And here the said Nicholas has his Free Court, and Pleas of bloodshed, and hue-and-cry, and gaUows, warren, Market, and Fair ; and these he has used.\" At the Assizes of October 1292 the borough of Neuport and the Manor of Edgmond were for the first time represented by distinct Jurors, though WiUiam Noblet was Chief BaUiff for both. The Edgmond Jurors were John de Halis, Richard de Holeweye, WUliam de la Grene, Roger de Pycstoke, WUliam fitz Edyth, and Richard Bryd. The presentments of these two Juries seem to be combined. They stated that Nicholas de Audley's rent to the Crown was one Hawk, and 4s. 4d. de ineremento. Audley had to show that he had paid such rent, and he called the Pipe-RoUs to warranty. The truth of this was to be tested ad proximum Parliamentum. At these same Assizes, the Jurors of Bradford Hundred presented Nicholas de Audley for exercising the following franchises in Neuport, viz. holding a free-court, twice yearly ; having a gallows ; and holding emendals of bread and beer. Tbis presentment was, as usual, fol lowed up by a Writ of Quo Waranto, caUing on Audley to prove his right to hold Pleas of the Crown, and to have ways, market, fair, and the said emendals, and free warren, in Egemundon and Newburgh. Audley defended his rights on the ground that Henry III.'s Charter to his Ancestor included franchises and free -customs, and on the ground of prescriptive usage. The Crown Lawyer in sisted that such Franchises, as inherent in the Crown, could not be conveyed to a subject without being categorically included in a Charter. The cause was adjourned.1 On Nicholas de Audley's death in 1299 his tenure of Egemandon and Novus Burgus seems to have been recorded,3 but the Inquest is illegible. Thomas de Audley, deceased in 1308, had been seized of one-third only of Egemundon and its members. The net revenue from this was \u00a37. 6s. lid.3 John de Bruyntone is set down as Lord of Egmindon in the Novum Villarum of March 1316. He was per haps the second husband of some Widow of an Audley.

I have already shown how this member of Edgmond was granted to Croxden Abbey by King John in 1206. Its reputed fiscal value was \u00a32. 2s. 8d. per annum; and the subsequent Pipe- Rolls usually deduct that sum from the Firma Comitatus as so much land given to the \" Monks of Crokesdene in Edwineie.\" A Tenure- Roll of the year 1211 seems to contradict the fiscal language of the Pipe-Rolls. It says that \" the Abbot of Crokesden holds, by gift of King John, Edimey, a member of Egnuden, in perpetual alms ;\" that \"the estate usually pays 40s. per annum, but will be (read was) given to them (the Monks) for 60s.\"1 The truth is that fiscal, or reputed, value is not here alluded to. The entry means to say that the actual income from Adeney was only 40s., while King John meant to give the monks 60 solidates of land. If we look at King John's Charters, the last idea will prove to have been erroneous. It was 100 solidates of land which King John was moraUy bound to provide for the said Monks.3 \u25a0 In 1255 Croxden Abbey was receiving \u00a34. 16s. from its estate at Audoney. Clement de Audoney, perhaps an Undertenant of the Abbey, had given his land to the Knights Templars of Keel, and had become their Vassal, paying them 2s. per annum for their ad vowry? The Assize-Roll of January 1256 shows the Abbot of Crokesden fining balf a merk for license to accord with James de Audley in a, placitum cheininii. Their Fine is preserved. Thereby Geoffrey de Thorp (Audley's Attorney) allows Walter, Abbot of Crokesden, to have a road through Audley's land of Egemendun. For this the Abbot paid 5 merks. In 1287 the Monks of Croxden gave Edwineye to Buildwas Abbey, receiving in exchange, from the Monks of Buildwas, the Grange of Caldon in Staffordshire.4, This transaction was ratified by a Charter of Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, dated June 10, 1287.5 (The Earl was Seigneural Lord of Caldon.) Hence in the Taxation of 1291 we find the Abbot of Buildwas deriving from Edewyneye \u00a33 of rents, and 6s. Sd. for Pleas and Perquisites.6 In 1292-3 the Abbot of Buildwas was prosecuted by the Crown for the Manor of Adoney juxta Egemundon.7 Of course he called the Abbot of Croxden to warranty, and of course that Abbot appeared 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 56. logica, Vol. II. p. 300. 2 Vide supra, p. 115, and Rot.

The King's Charter runs as follows. \u2014 Henricus Rex Angli\u00e6 et Dux Normanni\u00e6 et Aquitani\u00e6 et Comes Andegavi\u00e6, Willielmo filio Alani et omnibus fidelibus suis Francis et Anglis de Salop' salutem.

Testibus, Comite Reginaldo de Cornubia, Ricardo de Humez, Hugone de Mortemer. Apud Brug? I have already pointed out one historical significance of this Charter, viz. its constructive allusion to Hugh de Mortimer's sub mission.4 It tells yet another story, \u2014 a piece of Exchequer-history. The deduction which this grant must have made on the net value of Edgmond, was never brought into the Exchequer accounts or Pipe-RoUs, as any similar and later grant of Henry II.'s would have been. Consequently we know that the Firma Comitatus of Shropshire was not settled till after the date of this Charter, that is, till after Mortimer's submission. The Chroniclers tell us of Henry II.'s early reorganization of his Exchequer. The above Collectanea (ut supra). Monasticon.

Deed, coupled with the fragmentary and all but lost Pipe-Roll of 1155, and the full and extant Pipe-Roll of 1156, shows us the pro cess of that reorganization. Robert Pinzun was succeeded by Nicholas Piuzun, living in 1211. A Tenure-Roll of that year has this passage.\u2014 Nicholas Pithun (sic) tenet in eodem Manerio (scilicet Egnuden) iii virgatas terr\u00e6 per servicium quod debet invenire ij trusses feni ad cameram Regis cum venit apud Egumdon1 Nicholas Pinzun had property in Shrewsbury. He makes two grants in FrankweU, one to William Russel, the other to William, Son of Symon Sproht, whom he calls his brother.3 Early in Henry III.'s reign, Isabella, widow of Nicholas Pinzun, sells to Reginald her son all her dower within the borough of Shrewsbury.3 The above Reginald afterwards appears as Master Reginald Pin zun, son of Nicholas Pinzun of Salop. Under that name, and pro bably in the year 1241, he gives to Shrewsbury Abbey two virgates of land in Aston juxta Novum Burgum, and binds himself and his heirs to discharge the rent, due on the said two virgates and on his other land in Aston, viz. \" two trusses of hay when the King shall lie at Eychmundune.\" Witnesses, Sir John le Strange, then Sheriff of Salop, Nicholas de Weleleth (Wibley), Undersheriff ; and Robert de Geros.4 After this, Master Reginald Pinzun seems to have given or sold a very large property in Shrewsbury to the same Abbey, reserving in one instance considerable rents for his own life. Finally he re leases the said rents for the souls of himself and Aena his late wife.5 The Hundred- Roll of 1255 says that \"the Abbot of Salop holds two virgates of land in the vill of Aston Magna by an ancient grant, and takes thence one merk.\" - The interest acquired by Shrewsbury Abbey in Aston remained till the Dissolution. The Valor of 1534 gives the Abbot 6s. 8c?. rent from Monke Aston juxta Newporte,6 so that it would seem that this part of Aston had acquired a distinctive name indicative of its owners. Lilleshull Fee. It is clear that there was still a virgate in As ton, included in Henry II.'s grant to Robert Pinzun, but not trans ferred by Reginald Pinzun to Shrewsbury Abbey. Perhaps this was the virgate which Roger, son of Philip de Badger, held in the beginning of the 13th century. If so, he must 4 * 5 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 161, 163. 6 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III. 189. 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 56, a. 2 \u2022 \u2022\u00bb Salop Chartulary, No. 175."], [150, "124 EDGMOND. have held it under Pinzun. His Under-tenant was Gernegod de Aston, otherwise called Gernegod, son of Drogo the Chaplain, and perhaps the very person whom we have seen in the apparent posi tion of an Edgmond Juror in 1203, when he is called Garnegoc.1 Between the years 1200 and 1225 (as I infer), Roger de Bajesor, son of Philip de Bajesor,3 gives to LilleshaU Abbey, for the souls' health of himself and Amice his wife, the homage, service, and rent of Gernegod, son of Drwy the Chaplain, arising out of one virgate which the said Gernegod held in Eston, by a rent of 5s., payable to the Grantor. The Grant further stipulates that Gernegod himself shall discharge all forinsec services thereon.3 , There are two Confirmations of Henry III. to LUleshull Abbey, both dated 29th Nov. 1265. One confirms \" the donation and con cession which Roger de Bagesovere made of a rent of 5s. in La Lya.\" The other confirms \" the donation and concession which Roger de Baggeshovere made of 5s. rent in Magna Aston, and of the homage and service of Gernegod, son of Drogo the Chaplain, arising from one virgate in the same vill.\" It is clear that in the first of these confirmations there is a large omission, and that the person who really granted 5s. rent in La Lya was Ralph de Hodnet, as the second Confirmation proceeds to say. La Lya and Aston were therefore unconnected ; and Roger de Badger had nothing to do with the former. This will correct a mistake, which I made when previously aUuding to this subject.4. An old Rent-RoU of Lilleshull Abbey includes a half-yearly rent of 2s. 6c?. receivable from Gernegod de Eston.5 The Hundred-Roll of 1255 puts the Abbot of Lilleshull's rent, from one virgate in Aston Magna, at 5s. 4c?. The estate must have been improved, for at the Dissolution \u00a32. Ils. 4c?. of rents from Magna Ashton were among the assets of the late Abbey.6 Thorpe Fee. The residue or rather bulk of Great Aston seems to have remained in the demesne of the Manorial Lords, till James de Audley (I.) enfeoffed Geoffrey de Thorp therein, except one vir gate which in 1255 was held by Edith, a Widow of Newport, who had 4s. rent therefrom. At the same date Geoffrey de Thorp had broken up two carucates of the waste of the said Vill, and was now taking a fourth crop therefrom.7 1 Supra, p. 117.

I cannot account for this interruption in the otherwise direct descent of the Thorps. On October 10, 1296, Basilia, daughter of William Stevensone of New Borough, being a widow, gives to Adam, younger son of William Randoulf of the same, an acre in the waste of Magna Aston. This Deed, which is attested by William Rondulf, John Rondulf, John de Hales, and Nicholas le Colt, mentions lands of \" John Rondulf, Lord of Aston.\"3 By a Fine levied on January 27, 1304, Edmund, son of Geoffrey de Thorp (Impedient), gives a messuage and 17 acres in Magna- Aston-juxta-Newport, to John Randolf (Plaintiff), for 20 merks. By another Fine of May 31, 1304, the same John Randolf (Plaintiff) recognizes the right of Edmund de Thorp to 14 acres in Magna Aston, and, paying 10 merks, is allowed to hold them for life at a rose-rent. \u25a0 LITTLE ASTON, now CHURCH-ASTON. Of this place, as distinct from Great Aston, I have only one early notice. \u2014 On January 20, 1271, Adam de Brimton (of Longford) took out a Writ against James de Audley, for disseizing him of common pasture in Parva Aston. Aston Chapel. I cannot tell when this was founded, but Little Aston was also cabed Church Aston at least as early as the reign of Henry VIII. We may presume that it got this distinctive name from its Chapel. The said Chapel was probably of much earlier foundation than this, but at any rate it was a mere affiliation of Edgmond Church, and entirely subject thereto, so that its Incum bents or Ministers are not noticed in the early Diocesan Registers. Pickstock, or rather that part of the township which is in Edg mond Parish, was also a member of Edgmond Manor. I know nothing of the Tenants of this part of Pickstock except from seeing their names on Edgmond Jury Lists, or in other documents. Thus we have Thomas de Pickstock occuring in 1249 and 1250, Robert de Pickstock in 1255, 1256, 1272, and 1274, and Roger de Pick- stock in 1274 and 1292. proceedings in the vill of Aston (Ibidem, p. 58, where for Willo we should read Villa).

I can offer nothing but surmises on the matter, for it is only at one period that we hear of such a Serjeantry as existing. \u2014 In the year 1211 there were four persons who held lands in Shropshire by ser vice of accompanying the Sheriff when he conveyed the half-yearly ferm of the County to the Exchequer. Two of these Serjeants re sided near Stottesden, and one near Worfield. The fourth was William de Hales,1 whose tenure and abode I venture to place at Little-Hales. Previously and subsequently to 1211 the owners of Little- Hales occur frequently on Edgmond Juries. We have had William and Robert de Hales thus occurring in 1203. At the Assizes of 1221 WiUiam de Parva Hales pays half a merk for license to accord with William de Stokes, his Surety being WUliam Pantulf. The Fine thus contemplated is preserved. \u2014 Hugh Long and Emma his wife, William de Stokes and Matilda his wife, Plaintiffs, in a suit of mort d'ancestre against William de Parva Hales, for half a Mill in Parva Hales, quitclaim their right for 20s. In 1255 and 1256 Robert de Hales occurs. In 1272, 1274, 1281, 1284, 1285, 1296, and 1306, John de Hales, or de Parva Hales oc curs on various Juries, and we know that in 1285 he held Little Hales under Audley. In 1292 he was Foreman of an Edgmond Jury. In May 1284, William de Hales occurs on the same Jury with John ; and in April 1298, William de Parva Hales and Wil liam Wyan, of the same, are on a local Jury.2 I presume that, when Edgmond was granted to the Audleys, the Serjeantry of Little Hales naturally became obsolete. EDGMOND CHURCH. There is no proof that this was a Saxon foundation ; for it is not mentioned in Domesday. Still it had its Chapels, and, if not ex istent at Domesday, must have been founded, within eight years after that survey was taken, by Earl Roger de Montgomery. It was in short one of the Churches which he gave, with all its appur tenances, to Shrewsbury Abbey. In these respects its origin would be very similar to that of such Churches as Tong and Donington. Within 60 years after Domesday the Church of Newport had been 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 56, a. Liber Ru ber Scaccarii, fo. cxxxvii.

Hence Bishop Clinton's Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey includes \" the Church of Edg mund with its Chapels1 and a pension of 40s., and the Church of Neiv Borough, with its pension of 10s.\"3 Bishop Durdent's Charter confirms \" the Church of Egmundon with the tithe of that vill and with the Chapels pertaining to the said Church ; \u2014 also the Church of New Borough.\" Bishop Peche's Charter confirms the aforesaid Pensions, viz. 3 merks from the Church of Egnudune, and 10s. from the Church of New-Borough. It is remarkable that Henry II.'s great Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey speaks of the Churches of Egmendon and New-Borough as Earl Roger's gifts. The anachro nism was unperceived when the Charter was framed, and destroys neither the credit of the Deed nor its Draughtsman, for the earlier gift virtually involved its consequents. Bishop Novant conceded to Shrewsbury Abbey, its receipt, of 3 merks per annum, from the Church of Egemendon. Archbishop Peckham confirmed the above pensions of 40s. from Edgmond and 10s. from Newborough. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Egemindon (in New port Deanery) at \u00a312 per annum, over and above its decimable pen sion. The latter is entered as \u00a31. 10s. receivable by Salop Abbey and liable to Tenths.3 In 1341 the- Church-Taxation of Egemudon was quoted as \u00a320, but the Parish was only assessed \u00a311 for the Ninth of its wheat, wool, and lamb. The reasons of the reduction were because the Church-Taxation was high, and because \u00a31 thereof was alien to the present assessment.4 The Valor of 1534-5 gives (in one place) to the Abbot of Shrewsbury, a pension of \u00a31. 10s. from Egmonde.5 The Church itself, still a Rectory, was held by Thomas Brerewood, whose gross income was the goodly sum of \u00a348. His net income was \u00a346. 8s. ; the Procurations being 8s., the Synodals 4s., and the Abbot of Shrewsbury's pension being here put at 20s.6 The Chancel- Windows of Edgmond Church were formerly adorned with the following armorial insignia.\u2014 In the North Windows were 1 The original Chapelries of Edgmond were probably Tibberton, Longford, and Newport. to Shrewsbury Abbey by Patent of 34 Hen.

Geoffrey Griffin, Clerk (of whom I have spoken under Howie and Cherrington3), is said to have been Rector of Edgmond. He died in 1253, says my authority, leaving 20 merks for subsidy of the Holy Land, and appointing the Abbot of Haughmond and the Priors of Trentham and Wombridge his Executors.3 I presume that Geoffrey Griffin did not hold the Rectory of Edgmond till his death ; for on July 9, 1250, the King, by Letters Patent addressed to R. Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, presents \u2014 Artald de Sancto Romano to the Church of Egemendon. The King thus presented because the Abbacy of Shrewsbury was va cant.* For the same reason, a Patent of May 29, 1266, presents \u2014 Robert de Knithton to the Church of Egemondon. Ralph de la Bolde, Clerk, was instituted to this Church on July 25, 1305. (Patrons, The Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury.) He has licenses of non-residence, studendi gratia, in 1308, and in 1311, being at length styled Rector and Priest. John de Scheynton was instituted May 14, 1319. (Same Patrons.) He had dispensations in 1320, 1321, and 1322, being ordained Deacon and Priest in the latter year. In 1323, 1324, and 1325, he had similar licenses, the first and last, at the desire of Sir John de Cherlton, on whose following (obsequiis) he was to be in tendant; \u2014 the second for the sake of literary study. He had con tinuous licenses for non-residence from 1348 to 1355, and on Sept. 6, 1356, he exchanged preferments with \u2014 The note further quotes a receipt for Geoffrey Griffin's bequest from R., Arch deacon of Middlesex, Conservator of the Crueigeri in England and Wales.

I have spoken already of the three classes of Boroughs.4 New port belongs to the first class, for it was founded by a King, though it eventually became an appendage of the Barony of Audley. This was because it was founded within the Royal Manor of Edgmond, which Manor, with its appurtenances, was afterwards granted by Henry III. to Henry de Audley. !

Newport was therefore a Borough, or Corporate town, in that King's reign, and was doubtless founded by the King himself. Nay more, we are assured that Newport had a Church in the same reign, for immediately after the King's death Richard Priest of New-borough, and Pagan de Novoburgo, are found attesting a Grant by Hamo Peverel to Shrewsbury Abbey : and Bishop Clinton, who died in 1148, confirmed the Church of New-Borough to the same Abbey. The next evidence which I have of the existence of this Royal Borough is Henry II.'s Charter thereto, dated at Brewood. It un doubtedly passed between the years 1163 and 1166. It runs as follows. \u2014 Henricus, Rex Angli\u00e6 et Dux Normanni\u00e6 et Aquitani\u00e6 et Comes Andegavi\u00e6 omnibus, fye.

Apud Breuwood.1 Under Bridgnorth, I have described an annual increment on the ferm of that Borough, which arose to the Crown in 1167, i. e. after the ordinary ferm had been settled.3 It was probably for some re cently discovered pourpresture on the Royal demesnes. The same thing occurred in the case of Newport, in the year 1176. The Pipe- Roll of that year has the following entry. \u2014 Idem Vicecomes r. c. de in sol. de in domibus in Novo Burgo noviter recognitis per Justi ciarios errantes. In thesauro liberavit. Et quietus est. In other words the Justices-in-eyre had discovered three houses in Newport, built in such a place or manner, as that they were in the nature of a pourpresture, and were not protected by the general ferm (\u00a312. 2s. 8c?.) for which the Liberty of Edgmond and Newport was responsible. The Justices therefore set an extra ferm of 3s. on these houses. Under the head of \" Pourprestures and Escheats,\" the above sum was paid by the Sheriff till the year 1184 inclusive. In 1185 the Sheriff's receipt, de quibusdam domibus in Novo Burgo, was raised to 6s. This continued till 1189, when this item of account Harl.

Where the Escheators' Rolls are incidentally preserved (as in 1194, 1195, and 1196) the receipt of 6s. per annum, de redditu quorundam domorum in Novo Burgo, is duly acknowledged. In 1197, the item appears on the Pipe-Roll, that is the Sheriff receives 6s. as before ; he pays 4s. 4c?. into the Exche quer, but Is. Sd. he pays to Hugh Pantulf as part of 40 solidates of land, which the said Hugh was to have by gift of the King. This was repeated in 1198, but in 1199 the Sheriff accounts only 4s. 4c?., and says nothing about Hugh Pantulf whose grant of 20 denariates in Newport must henceforth be considered as absolute. In fact he had so much in land or houses which he managed him self, and the Sheriff was no longer accountable for what he did not receive. The Sheriff continued to be annually charged with 4s. 4c?. de cremento de Novo Burgo till 1234 or thereabouts. In 1235, this debt or liability is charged against Henry de Audley, as I should have expected it to have been charged long before, and as it was charged for long after. I need say no more on this subject, but that it is probable that there was some doubt about Audley's liability. At least in 1273, James de Audley (though his Sparrow-hawk-rent for Edgmond was eleven years in arrears), owed \u00a34. 15s. 4c?., or 23 years' arrears of this other rent of 4s. 4c?. I now return to the year 1176, when Shropshire had been visited by Bertram de Verdon and his companions, as Justiciars. They had amerced WUliam de Novo Burgo 40s., Adwin Telarius 40s., the Vill of Novus Burgus 2 merks, aud Nicholas Pulcer 2 merks ; \u2014 all for entertaining some excommunicated person. At the Assizes of 1203, it was alleged against the community of New Borough that the Assize of Bread was not kept in their town. A Tenure-Roll of the year 1211, enters Hugh Pantulf among those who held de dominicis Regis. \" He held 20 denariates of land in New Borough, which King Richard did give him in com plement of 7 librates of land, which the King had granted him in Herefordshire,1 per servidum unius moleschi.\"2 At the Assizes of 1221, as previously at those of 1203,3 the 2 Testa de Nevill, p. 56.

It was towards making up the remaining 40 solidates that King Richard gave him 20 denariates in Newport. 3 Supra, page 117."], [162, "132 NEWPORT. Borough of Newport was represented by its 12 Jurors. \u2014 Matilda de Stafford was named as complainant against William de Picksdock, Nicholas de Neuport, and Reginald fitz Alexander in a matter of the King's peace. This is the earliest instance I know of, in which the name Neuport is substituted for Newborough (Novus Burgus). The history of the Town now becomes involved with that of the Manor of Edgmond, under which many particulars have already transpired. A Writ of January 1, 1226, aptly Ulustrates a former remark. King Henry III. concedes to Henry de Audley, 19 days' seizin of the Manor of New-Borough, so that in the meantime he may more easily remove his effects therefrom.1 A second Writ of January 21, prolongs this privilege to February 7? A third ex tends it three weeks more.3 Thus for two months ofthe fiscal year ending Michaelmas 1226, Henry de Audley was seized of the Manor. The Pipe-Roll virtu ally computes the period of his seizin as three months. Henry de Audley became, as we have seen, Lord of Edgmond and Newport in July 1227. In October 1228, William Rufus, Attorney of Henry de Audley, who prosecuted for the King, was suing various persons by Quo Waranto, as to their right of holding messuages or Burgages in the King's demesne of Newport. The Prior of Ware, Hugh fitz Robert, Thomas de Bagesour, and Regi nald de Appeleg were impleaded, each for a messuage, the Prior of Wombridge, for a burgage, and Robert de Wodecote, for two messuages. Alexander le Peschur, William Barat, Robert de As pel, Adam de Brinton, James de Morton, and Robert de Offeleg were similarly impleaded. The result does not appear. The last Defendant said that his son Ralph was the actual Tenant.* Of course Audley was the real Prosecutor, though he was entitled to use the King's name. On November 14, 1236, Nicholas fitz Richard, Tenant of two messuages in Novo Burgo, quitclaims his right to Alan de Burgo and Amice his wife, who in turn allow him to hold one croft in fee, at a rent of Is., and capital services. There was a famous Vivary at Newport, of which I shall have to say more hereafter. One of the services of the Burgesses was to convey the fish, taken in this Vivary, to the King's Court. This custom continued as a right due to the Audleys. Hence between the years 1247 aud 1253 we have the following curious release. \u2014 \" James, son of Henry de Audley, quitclaims to the Burgesses of -\u2022\u2022\u25a0\u2022\u2022\u2022 Claus.

Hervey de Esseburne is also mentioned in this Inquest as a btigious Burgess of New Borough. On February 22, 1259, four Justices are appointed by Patent to hear certain matters of variance between James de Audley and Roger de Somery. Somery's men had trespassed on the Vivary of Neuport. This place is again called Neuport in the Assize-Roll of 1267. \u2014 One John ate Pole had died, leaving a daughter, Agnes, now wife of Nicholas ate Pole. He had also apparently left a Widow now wife of Alexander at Pole. The question was whether Agnes was heir to a messuage in Neuport, or whether Alexander at Pole, who held the whole, was entitled to a third thereof. The Jury found that Agnes' mother had no dower therein, and that her father, whose heir she was, had died seized thereof. So Nicholas and Agnes recovered.3 At these or some other Assizes of 1267, the Men of the Liberty of Novus Burgus were amerced 2 merks for non-attendance. William de Audley, who died in 1282, had only a partial interest in Neuport, his Mother, Ela, holding the greater portion in dower. He had Gs. 2c?. in rent : his sixth of the MiU and Vivary wa3 worth 5 merks (\u00a33. 6s. 8c?.) : his tolls from the Market were 10s. ; and his receipts from local Pleas were 10s. The Burgesses' obligation to carry his fish anywhither in Shrop shire was mentioned, but not valued as an asset. Between the years 1285 and 1292, Nicholas de Audley grants to his Burgesses of Novus Burgus a right of common in Brodemerss. The vill of No vus Burgus, the ditch of Longe Meduwe, the fields of Magna Aston and Northbrom (now Norbrom), are mentioned as boundaries of the grant. It is attested by Sir Robert Corbet, Sir Adam de Bruynton (Brimton), Sir Wilbam de Hodnet, and Sir Peter de Eyton, Knights; also by Reginald de Chetwynd; Roger de Py velesdon; John de Weston, then Seneschal; and John de Parva Hales.

Further, out of special favour to Nicholas Levere, a Burgess of the town, whom the King calls hospitem nostrum, he exempts the Burgesses from murage throughout the realm.3 At the Assizes of 1292 the \" Vill of Neuport \" was represented by its Chief Bailiff, \u2014 William Noblet, and by Wilbam Rondulf, Richard Ale mond, Robert de Morton, Richard de la Lone, John Rondulf, and Roger Priest, \u2014 Jurors. Under the head, De Libertibus, it was pre sented at these Assizes that the Burgesses of Novus Burgus claimed to have a Court, to assize bread and beer, and to have a Merchant- Guild. The Burgesses appeared, and said that they had exercised these franchises from time whereof memory was not : they adduced Henry II.'s Charter (as before recited) and said that, both before and after that Charter, they had exercised these franchises. It does not appear that the Burgesses were molested by any ulterior pro cess of Quo Waranto. Another presentment seems to have been a complaint of their own, viz. that the Lords of Wem had been accustomed to provide Sergeants of the Peace to guard the pass (transitum) of Shakel * *,3 on account of robbers, for 15 days, before and after the Feasts of St. Michael and St. John Baptist, and to take from the men of other Counties, who might pass, a passage-fee (passagium), viz. 2d. for every cart. Now they took this fee from men of the County (of Salop), to the grievance of the neighbourhood. This matter could not be entered into by the Justices, because William le Bo tyler (of Wem) was under age. By Deed dated at New Borough on April 5, 1293, Nicholas Peye of New Borough gives to Peter, son of Peter Fuller, a messuage and curtilage in that vill, bounded by land of William de Kynar- 1 One of the landmarks of this grant is \" The Cross set up for the soul of Roger de Pynelesdon.\" I suppose this must have been that Roger who was deceased in 1272 (supra, Vol. VIII. p. 96).

On June 30, 1309, a Newport Deed is at tested by Richard de Heydon (Query, Geydon), Rector of Neuport, John de Chetwynd, and John Rondulf.5 On May 2nd, 1311, King Edward II. inspects and confirms his Father's Charter of 1287 to the Burgesses of Novus Burgus.

This tenure in Newport deserves a distinct notice. \u2014 In November 1228, the Abbot of LUlishull names Brother Walter de Peshal his Attorney, in a suit of land in Novus Burgus, wherein Henry de Audley was Plaintiff and the Abbot was Tenant. Between the years 1235 and 1240, S. Abbot of LUleshuU quitclaims to Ameba de Hal and her heirs his right in half a mes suage in Novo Burgo held by Joeta, widow of Adam fitz Reyner. Amelia covenants to pay 6c?. rent to the Abbey, and to seU the premises to no one, save to Nicholas le Turnur, or to LUleshuU Abbey.3 A Rent- Roll of LUleshuU Abbey, which I conceive to be at least as old as the above Deed, speaks of a much larger interest in New borough than I can trace in Charters. Rents amounting to 50s. 10c?. per annum are enumerated, among which one of 6s. was pay able by Alexander de Pickstock. About 1252-3, Edelina, daughter of Durandus the Priest, Widow, gives to the Abbey two messuages in Novo Burgo, viz. those which Durandus bought and gave to her. The Abbot was to pay Edelina a life annuity of 4s. and provide her with a daily Corrody of bread and beer. If Roger, son of Stephen, son of the said Edebna, sur vived her, he was to receive the life-annuity of 4s. but not the Cor rody. Edelina gave the Abbot seizin in the Full Hundred-Court of Novus Burgus, before Sir Geoffrey Griffin ; Robert de Wudecote ; Roger de Pivelesdon ; Alexander Piscator ; Dionisius de Fortelest ; Philip de Mortun ; Robert de Waletun, and the whole Hundred of Novus Burgus.4 In 1274 the Jurors of Edgmond and Newport complained that the Abbot of Lilleshull having 40s. rent in the Vill of Newport, had withdrawn his suit, due thrice a year to the local Court.

The Ministers' Accounts, six years later, put the same item at \u00a31. 6s. 9c?. Wombridge Priory Fee. Rainald, a Monk of Wombridge, gave two menses and 4 acres in Novo Burgo, to his Priory. This was before 1187, but I find no evidence of the Monks retaining such a property. The Abbot of Buildwas had also a burgage in Newport; how acquired I know not. In 1534-5 it yielded 4s. 2c?. rent.3 The Prior of Ware (in Hertfordshire) had sometime a burgage in New port. It was obtained doubtless with relation to those Staffordshire interests which the Prior overlooked, on the part of the Norman Abbey of St. Evroult at Uticum. THE SERJEANTRY OP NEWPORT. The arms of the Town of Newport (three fishes in pale) are al lusive to the famous Vivary which adjoined the town, aud to a cer tain service, by which the Burgesses seem to have held their Liber ties. \u2014 They had to convey to the King's Court, wherever it might be, the fish taken in this Vivary. The Custos of Newport Vivary was also a Tenant-in-capite by Serjeantry, as will presently appear. Reiner de Novo Burgo, the first of these Keepers whom I can name, was succeeded at the close of the 12th century by his son \u2014 Alexander de Novo Burgo, of whom we have had some account under Uppington.4 A Record of about 1200 says that \"Alexander 1 LilleshaU Chartulary, fo. 75.

Of course, when Newport and its Vivary passed to the Audleys, this Serjeantry ceased ; but Alexan- der's descendants continued to hold their property in Newport and Shrewsbury by some other tenure. Having traced this descent al ready, what I have now to say is merely supplementary. \u2014 Roger de Novo Burgo, son of Alexander, is called Roger de Neuport, when sitting as Foreman of a Leegomery Inquest in 1249. This is an early instance of the name Neuport occurring as a sub stitute for Novus Burgus. Alexander fitz Roger, who succeeded his Father in December 1252,4 is I presume the Alexander Piscator who attests about that time a grant to Lilleshall Abbey. In Trinity Term 1269 Philippe Mamillon (read Marmion) was suing Roger de Brumtone, Ralph de Loskessford, and Alexander de Neuport, for a violent raid on his property at Norbury (Staffordshire) . Alexander de Aula, the New port Juror of 1272 and 1274, was identical with the last of the three Defendants. The Inquest taken on his death in 1275 has been given under Uppington. William de Aula or de la Sale, son and heir of Alexander, sat on a Chetwynd Jury in 1281, 5 and died in 1283, leaving a son 1 \u2022 2 * 3 Testa de Nevill, pp. 61, 55, 56. under age. Nicholas pleads that Roger had, since he came of age, accepted his service, viz. 1*. per annum, and up to Mi chaelmas last, when 6d. had been so ac cepted. The parties accorded, Nicholas surrendering the premises, and Roger con ceding him a Use-tenure of half thereof, at id. rent, with remainder to himself and his heirs.\" (Assizes, 40 Hen. III., m. 2.) 4 The Inquest on the death of Roger de Novo Burgo is arranged among the Re cords of 37 Henry III. (1252-3); and there is good, but not internal, evidence that such was its date. The following Trial of January 1256 relates therefore to a different person. \u2014 \" Roger fitz Alexander sues Nicholas Colt for a messuage in Newport as his right, seeing that he had demised it when 5 Nicholas de Aula was on the same Jury."], [169, "139 THE CHURCH. Roger, only 3 years of age. From the Assize- Roll of 1292, it ap pears that Nicholas le Colt of Neuport had commenced a suit against Nicholas de Audley for custody of the land and heir of William atte Halle of Neuport, a suit which he now declined to prosecute. Roger de la Sale, arriving at full age in October 1301, is pro bably identical with Roger Piscator, whom we have seen attesting a Deed about that time.1 When this family ceased to hold in-capite at Uppington the Inquests cease to mark the succession of its re presentatives. Two other famUies, resident i:i Newport, deserve a brief notice. \u2014 Nicholas Colt, who was at issue in 1256 with Roger fitz Alex ander,2 seems to be the person caUed Nicholas fitz Alexander in a Jury-List of the same year. He occurs, as Nicholas le Colt, on a Chetwynd Jury in 1281, and appears as a witness 20 years later. I have some idea that he was the person who has been mentioned under Brockton, as living from 1261 to 1292, and as being called Nicholas le Waleys or le Messenger? His Tenant at Brockton, caUed Alexander le Cold in 1284, was probably a relation. The Family of Randolf, originally traders of Newport, became of importance there and elsewhere. Of William Randolf and his three sons, Geoffrey, Simon, aud Adam, we have spoken under Woodcote, and Church Aston.4 Geoffrey will recur to our notice under Bicton. There was also a John Randolf, who occurs in local affairs from 1292 to 1304, and who, in one instance, was called \" Lord of Magna Aston.\" He was probably another son, or a brother, of WiUiam Randolf. NEWPORT CHURCH. This Church, probably founded by Heury I., and coeval with the Borough, was necessarUy an affibation of Edgmond and in the patronage of Shrewsbury Abbey. Its earlier history I have given with that of Edgmond Church. Bishop Clinton's (1129-1148) Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey treats of the Churches of Edgmond and Novus Burgus as distinct properties, not of the latter as being among the Chapelries of the former. The inference is, that Newport Church had been founded before Bishop Clinton's time, and so, early rather than 1 Supra, page 137, note 1. 3 Supra, page 138, note 4. 3 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 95, 96. 1 Supra, pp. 15, 125."], [170, "NEWPORT. 140 late in Henry I.'s reign. Be that as it may, the Bishop's Charter entitles the Monks of Shrewsbury to the Advowson of Novus Bur gus, and to an annual pension of 10s., receivable from the Incum bent thereof.1 Bishop Peche's Confirmation uses precisely the same terms.2 That a Church and Borough founded as late as Henry I.'s reign should have given name to a Rural-Deanery is an important fact. It shows that the Rural Deaneries, as they appear arranged in the Taxation of 1291, had been so constituted less than two centuries before. A similar possibility has been spoken of in respect of the Rural Deanery of Ludlow, viz. that it may have got its name after the Conquest.3 Further, when we find, as in the cases of Eyton, Waters Upton, and Preston,4 that the Saxon distinction of Parishes was forgotten or ignored, when our Rural Deaneries were consti tuted, that is, that the Mother Church was placed in one Deanery, the Daughter in another, we may presume that Rural Deaneries originated no earlier than the 12th century. The Church of Newport was, as might be expected, most slen derly endowed. The Taxation of 1291 puts its Revenues at \u00a32. 13s. 4c?.5 By Inquisition, taken at Newport on May 24, 1313, it was found to be noninjurious to the Crown, if the King should aUow Nicholas de Audeleye to give, in pure almoign, to Master Richard de Gey don, Parson of the Church of Newport, one acre of land in New port, whereon to build houses and dwelling for the said Parson and his Successors. The value of the proposed grant was 3d. per annum? In 1341 the Parish of Newport was assessed to the Ninth at 40s., and not more, because the small tithes and oblations of the Parish went to make up the greater sum (at which the Church was taxed), and were not relevant to the current assessment.7 On March 29, 1442, King Henry VI. empowers the Abbot of Salop, Patron of Newport Church (valued at 17 merks per annum), to alienate the same with its tithes and oblations, and the tithes of Littel and Muchel Astone, in Edgmond Parish, to Thomas Draper and his heirs, so that the said Thomas might found a College in the said Church, to the praise of God and the Virgin Mary, and also a Chantry of two Chaplains, who were to perform divine service in a 1 \u2022 2 Harl.

The Fellows were to elect their Warden, and present him to the Abbot of Salop. The said Warden was to have the Cure of souls among the Parishioners of Newport, and a sufficient sum was to be annually distributed among the poor Parishioners according to the Statute De appropriationibus.1 \u2014 Such were the resources adopted by good and honest men to re medy the spiritual destitution of the period. The working Church was in fact to be reorganized and re-endowed by the Laity, whUe the Monks either sold or held fast the revenues arising from local tithes. In the Valor of 1534-5, the \" Church of the GuUd of Newporte\" appears with far less than its contemplated Revenues, viz. as re ceiving a salary or pension of \u00a36. 13s. 4c?.

How the Wrekin acquired the name of Mount Gilbert is a ques tion which probably will never be answered. The fact is too old for investigation. In the time of Henry III. we find the Jurisdiction of this Forest subdivided into two principal districts, viz. the Bailiwick of Hagh mon, and the Bailiwick of Wombridge. Now those two Monastic Houses did not grow into any repute till the reign of Henry II. ; and there can be no doubt that the rights of the Crown, in respect of Forests, were strictly renewed, if not largely increased by that Monarch. The new names, which obtained in the Wrekin Forest, certainly indicate aggrandizement rather than revival. I know of nothing in the character of Henry II. to defend him from any charge of selfish injustice or extortionate wrong. The Wrekin Hill was the principal feature of this Forest, but it was far from central. The Forest- Jurisdiction lay wholly on the Eastern or Wrekin side of the Severn. The Domesday Hundred of Recordine was almost pervaded by the said Jurisdiction, but it also extended partially into the Hun dreds of Alnodestreu, Patinton, and Bascherch ; and into the very Liberties of Shrewsbury. At Sheriff-Hales it included a part of Staffordshire. The scope and exercise of this Jurisdiction wUl ap pear best from the successive documents which allude to it. The Forest- RoU of 1180 points to a few concessions or rather sales of Forest-land, made by Henry II. to his lieges near the Wrekin. \u2014 Pourprestures or Wastes were compounded for at Ruckley, Haughton 1 Supra, Vol. V p. 144."], [174, "144 THE FOREST OF MOUNT GILBERT. (near Shiffhal), LilleshaU, Donington, Tibberton, (Little) Buildwas, Leighton, Hales (probably Sheriff Hales), Chetwynd, Lawley, Ast ley (near Shrewsbury), and Albrighton (near Shrewsbury). Im bladements or assarts were assessed in Lilleshall, Priors Lee, Ket ley, Idsall, Goldestan (Goldstone), Cipenol (Chipnall), Lawley, Arleston, Hencott (near Shrewsbury), Leegomery, and Leighton. On the Forest-Roll of 1209 there are two Regards of Mount Gilbert, that is, assessments or fines set on persons or places within the Jurisdiction. The places which seem to be indicated are Eyton Abbots, Kemberton, Ketley, Dawley, Priors Lee, Wombridge, Drayton (near Idsall), Tibberton, Haughton (near Idsall), Calving ton, Lee Gomery, Arleston, Lawley, Hales (probably Sheriff Hales), Horton, Preston (on the Wealdmoors), Idshall, Leighton, and Pim ley, with some others not so easy to identify. At these Assizes one criminal prosecution is worth notice. It was stated how four County Serjeants (Servientes Comitatus), viz. Richard de Holton, Wilikine de Estlegh, Hulle de Hineton, and Hulle Robucke, had found venison in the house of Hugh le Scot; and how the said Hugh took asylum in a Church. Then came the Verderers and Foresters to that Church and questioned Hugh as to whence he got the venison ; and he and one Roger de Welinton confessed that they had killed a doe (bissam) which furnished the venison. Hugh declined to quit the Church, and lived a month there ; but after wards escaped in woman's clothes (in specie mulieris). Both he and Roger de Welinton were now Fugitives. The Sheriff was or dered to summon them in form (quod exiganlur1), and, on their appearance, to have them outlawed. In reference probably to this matter the next clause on the Roll states that the vills of Welling ton, Arleston, Lawley, and Ketley, were \" in misericordid, because they denied what they had before acknowledged.\" The Survey of Shropshire Forests, taken in 1235, speaks as fol lows, on the state of those woods, which I presume to have been subject to the Jurisdiction of Mount-Gdbert. \u2014 Item, visi fuerunt bosci de Pimel' et de Horlavescot,\" multum vastati tempore ultim\u00e6 guerr\u00e6 dum Comes Lincoln' et Milites apud Saloppiam, ad villam custodiendam, moram faciebant? 1 The process of exigatur was per formed in the County Court.

We now pass to the Iter of Geoffrey de Langley in 1250. \u2014 His arrentations exempted from waste and regard, numerous parcels of land, previously within this Jurisdiction. Among the localities thus benefited were Wellington, Pimley, Sundorn, Coalbrookdale, Harles cott, Albrighton, and Astley (near Shrewsbury), Idshal, Haughton, Eyton (on the Wealdmoors), Hadley, Horton, Wombridge, Sheriff- Hales, Burlaughton, Heathull,1 and Woodcote, Sutton Maddock, Dawley, and Upton (near Shiffnal). In 1255, the Bradford Jurors reported how John fitz Hugh (of Bolas) was Chief Forester of Haymon (the Bailiwick is meant), and had under him two Valets, each of whom paid him 20s. per annum, the Jurors knew not by what warrant. For cheminage 2 too, a sum of 2s. per annum seems to have been levied, and paid over, to tbe King's Exchequer. The freemen who had boses in Haughmond (BaUiwick) demanded, apparently, that all attachments for Forest-law should be made before the Seneschal of the King's Forests. The men of Haughton paid 4s. per annum to John fitz Alan for half an acre of assart in the Forest. Of this the Jurors knew not the warranty.3 Some particulars about Wellington- Haye supplied by these Ju rors have already been given.4 Robert de Halton and Thomas de Roshall had sold 52 oak-trees therein since Easter 1255, but the Jurors knew not the price obtained. Also Hugh de Lee and Ralph de la Lowe had sold 8s. worth of sand (sablicium) in the same Have. The same Jurors presented that John de Beulewas (identical with John fitz Hugh) was Capital Forester of Mount Gilbert and of Wombrug, and had in the Forest of Wombrug two Under-foresters, who paid him 12s. per annum each, the Jurors knew not by what warranty. He had also one Under-Forester in Mount Gilbert, but he paid nothing.5 The Jurors of Pimhill, again, complained of John fitz Hugh's exaction of cheminage, viz. from \\d. to 2c?. per annum on different kinds of carts plying in Haumon- Forest.6 The 1 Heath-Hill I take to be the high ridge which separates Woodcote and Lil leshall. cept by such Foresters-of-the-Fee as paid a rent to the Crown for their Bailiwicks. This was not the case, I think, with John fitz Hugh. 2 Cheminage was a toll levied by Fo resters on teams and pack-horses plying in their jurisdiction. King John's Char ter of the Forest forbid it to be levied ex- 3 Rot. Hundred. II. 56. * Supra, pp. 47, 48. 5 * \u00bb Rot. Hundred. II. 58, 76."], [177, "147 THE FOREST OF MOUNT GILBERT. Foresters of this Bailiwick had further exacted contributions of oats, wheat,1 and poultry, from Harlescott and Hadnall, as their due. At the Forest Assizes of 1262, the Regard of the Jurisdiction, now under notice, is called the Regard of Wombrig, of Mount Gilbert and of Hawemon. An assart of 17 acres by the Abbot of Haugh mon at Sundorn, was of long standing and justified by Royal Charter. The Bosc of William Banastre (of Hadnall, I presume) was wasted of old time and recently, by the said William. He was put in misericordid, and the wood was seized in manu Regis. At the Forest Assizes of 1271, Michael de Burgo and other Stafford shire people were presented as habitual malefactors with respect to venison, in the Forest of Mount Gilbert and Wombrugge. The First Perambulation of the Forests, in Edward I.'s time, next demands our notice. The foUowing Vills, Boses, and lands, which had pertained to the Forestership of Wellington were now disforested, viz. the VU1 of Clotleye with two plains ; half the vill of Astone with half its plains and with the Bosc of Mount Gilbert ; the bosc of Rugston (probably Rushton) with one plain; half the vill of Garmeston with one plain ; half the vUl of Leygchton with a bosc and two plains ; the boses of Opiton, BuUdwas and Little Caldebroc (Coalbrookdale) ; half Sutton (Maddock) with a bosc and two plains ; half Brocton, with one plain ; the vill of Madeleye, with its bosc and two plains ; the vill of Great Dalileye with its bosc and plain ; Little Dalileye ; \u2014 a messuage at La Holte2 ; the Vill of Laueleye with two plains ; Little-Wenloke with its plain and woods ; the vill of Unti done (Huntington) with its plains; and the ViU of Ardelestone (Arleston) with two plains. These details relate but to a part of the Wrekin Forest, viz. that part which lay more immediately round the Wrekin. The Great and final Perambulation of 1300 is much fuller as to the Jurisdic tion abandoned, and also gives a minute description of that which was retained. \u2014 \" The Jurors say that the Lord King hath in Shrop shire a certain Haye, which is called the Haye of Welinton ; and it is Forest according to these bounds, viz. from Clerkenebrugge in Watlingestrete, going up, along the Stonibrok,3 to the top of Ra dulf de Clotlegh's garden ; thence up along Stonybrok to the Quyk sond; thence up along a certain road to the Merok ; thence up to 1 Viz. \"xvi windellos aven\u00e6 et xxxn garbas wernagii,\" from each vill. 3 The Stony-brook was probably the Rivulet which crosses the Watling Street a httle to the West of the Hay-Gate, and flows thence Northwards. 2 Near Buildwas, I think (supra, Vol. VII. pp. 323, 324)."], [178, "148 THE FOREST OF MOUNT GILBERT. the Salyn j and thence up to the Fountain called The Sprungwall in the field of Huntiton.

The Wrekin Hermitage. I cannot pass away from the Wre kin Forest without noticing this feature of the wilderness, though I cannot identify its situation. That there was a Hermitage on the Wrekin, in Henry III.'s reign, is proved by the simple fact that there was a \" Hermit of Mount Gilbert,\" who benefited by that Monarch's alms. Nicholas de Denton was this hermit's name. By a Patent of September 17, 1267, the King grants to \"Nicholas de Denton, Heremite of Mount Gilbert, six quarters of corn to be paid him by the Sheriff of Shropshire, out of the issues of Pendleston Mill.\"6 The object announced, is \" to give the Hermit greater leisure for holy exercises (ut possit liberius vacare divinis), and to support him during his life, so long as he shall be a Heremite on the afore said Mountain.\" From the Pipe-Rolls I learn that the Sheriffs of 1268 and 1269 paid the Hermit 24s. per annum in lieu of the above corn ; for the fact was that the Sheriff did not receive the rents of Pendleston Mill at all ; and the Burgesses of Bridgnorth who paid the said rents, paid them, not in kind, but in money.7 A second Patent of King Henry III., dated March 29, 1270, orders 4 Already alluded to, Vol. VI. p. 178. 1 Probably Coalmore. 3 Vide supra, Vol. II. pp. 311, 312. 5 Albrighton, near Shrewsbury. It be longed to Shrewsbury Abboy, and so got the distinctive name here given. 3 This place, apparently a member of Madeley, is now lost. Its derivative, in the shape of a surname, '\u2022 Capsey,\" is still to be met with in Shropshire. 6 Vide supra, Arol. I. p. 304. '\" Supra, Vol. I. p. 310. 19 b IX."], [180, "ODENET HUNDRED. 150 an annuity of 2 merks, oftt of Pendleston Mill, to be paid to \" Nicholas\" de Denton, Eremite of Mount Gilbert.\" The payment of half-a-year's proportion of this annuity, by the Burgesses of Bridgnorth (who farmed Pendleston Mill under the Crown) , has already been noticed. The said payment was first cer tified in 1273, when, if the Hermit had been living and resident, it should have been eightfold. We may conclude that he had vacated his stormy post, but whether by necessity or choice, let the Idealist or the Utilitarian decide. <&Ximtt J^untireti* The general representative ofthe Domesday Hundred of Odenet is the present Hundred of Bradford-North. The annexed Table will show four exceptions to that Rule. So also a Table, already given,1 will show how Bradford-North contains eleven Manors which were not in the Domesday Hundred of Odenet, but in ihe Domesday Flundred of Recordine. Again, the Hundred of Odenet contained one Manor (Tirley) which is now reputed to be in Staffordshire ; and, vice versa, North- Bradford Hundred now contains two Manors (Cheswardine and Chipnall) which Domesday had place in Staffordshire. Also North- Bradford Hundred contains three Manors or parts of Manors, two of which (Moreton Corbet and part of Preston-Brockhurst) Domes day had placed in Bascherch Hundred, and one of which (Sleap Magna), the Domesday Scribes had, by some inadvertency fixed in Culvestan Hundred. And now as to the exact letter of Domesday ,- \u2014 the annexed Table places four2 Manors in Odenet Hundred which Domesday does not declare to have been so situated. There are also two3 cases of doubt ful identity, in which the letter of the Record is preserved, though the interpretation thereof may be problematical or hopeless. Such cases I leave to be discussed under the Manors themselves. 1 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 198-201. 2 Viz. Lee Brockhurst, Ludecote, Soul- I ton, and Moston. * Viz. Lai and Ludecote."], [181, "ODENET HUNDRED. 151 I may now turn to the history of Bradford-Hundred already promised j1 \u2014 a Hundred, which, in its Northern and Southern divi sions combined, very nearly represents the Domesday Hundred of Recordine and Odenet united. Before Odenet Hundred was thus absorbed in Bradford, its caput was Hodnet. It was, as a Hundred, held in demesne, first, by the Palatine Earls of Shrewsbury, and then by King Henry I. From the Hundred and Manor of Odenet Earl Roger derived,a revenue of j\u00a38;2 the greater part of that sum probably arising from the Hundred. Though it was King Henry I. who undoubtedly reor ganized the Shropshire Hundreds, I find no mention of Bradford Hundred till the year 1203, when it was duly represented at the County Assizes. On this occasion five murders and one case of accidental death were reported by the Jurors ; and the Justices made orders apposite to each case. \u2014 The sixth Plea of the Crown, given under Bradford Hundred, is connected with an interesting event in County- History, \u2014 the rebel lion and outlawry of Fulk fitz Warin. This outbreak, it will be remembered had commenced in 1201, and the Outlaw was not pardoned till November 1203, a month after the Assizes. At the Assizes \" William Wigun challenged William Provost of Ercalew (High Ercall) for having entertained the King's Outlaws in his House, to wit, Fulk fitz Warin and his associates.\" The Provost now appeared, denied the charge, and offered a fine of one mark to have an Inquest on the subject. The Fine was accepted, Hugh Pantulf being Security for its payment. The Jurors (of the In quest) and the whole County Court found that the Provost was not guilty, that he was a liege man, and that the Appellant had accused him in malice, and with the view of getting some land which was in dispute between them. So the Provost had his quietus and his Accuser was pronounced in misericordid. It was explained at the Inquest that though the alleged reception of the Outlaws pur ported to date three years back, according to the Appellant's evidence, yet he, the Appellant, had never mentioned it till June last. One inference due to the above premises is that Fitz Warin's rebellion commenced in 1200, not as I have elsewhere stated, in 120 1.3 At the Assizes of 1221 the presentments for Bradford Hundred included seven cases of murder, one of accidental death, one of ar son and robbery, and two of assault, actual or threatened. One of the murdered persons was Thomas de Erkalewe, and his two mur- 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 202. ** Domesday, fo. 253, a, 2. 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 72."], [182, "152 TABLE OF THE DOMESI Domesday Name.

In 1255 Hugh de Beckbury was Fermor or Bailiff of Bradford Hundred. He paid the Sheriff 23 merks per annum for the office. At the Assizes of January 1256, Thomas de Schepele appeared as Chief-Bailiff. His rent to the Sheriff seems to have been 20 merks, but his Sureties had to make it good. The next Bailiff (about 1263), was Elyas de Stoke. He paid the Sheriff 15 merks; but could realize only 8 merks. The rest was supplied out of his own chattels.

Walter de Pedwardine's appointment to this Bailiwick on June 24, 1267, at a rent of 8 merks, has been already noticed.2 The Patent-Roll of 1271 contains a memorandum which shows the heavy responsibilities which attached to a Hundred, in virtue of its jurisdiction, or rather its \"keeping of Crown-Pleas,\" as the phrase was. On November 4th in that year the men of Bradford Hundred paid the King 100s., because a Felon had escaped from their custody. At the Assizes of 1272, William le Enfaunt (a well-known dealer in Ferms of this kind) was Chief Bailiff of Bradford Hundred. I suppose that he rented the office under Pedwardine. One of the statements of the Jury was, that the Hundred was worth 28 merks, and that it was a Demesne- Hundred of the King, and that Sir Walter de Pedwardyne held it for life, at a rent of 8 merks. His Charter to that effect was produced in Court. John Coly was the next Bailiff of this Hundred who has occurred to my notice. Some time previous to the year 1291, Bradford Hundred was found to bear a proportionate value of 20 merks in the aggregate ferms which went under the name of the Corpus Comitatus. William de Tittele, Sheriff in that year, claims the said reduction from his liabilities ; and Walter de Pedwardine, as Fermor of the Hundred, renders a separate account of his lighter liabilities, under the Royal grant. At the Assizes of October 1292 William Cresset stands on the Jury List as Chief Bailiff of Bradford Hundred. The strict accu racy of this may be doubted if we look at the presentments of the Jury. \"Walter de Pedwardin,\" they said, \"holds the Hundred for 8 merks ; and he had made it over to William Crasset for 36 merks (per annum), to the injury of all the Freeholders.\" The Justices, on its being further stated that William Crasset now lay under an indictment for murder and other evil deeds, ordered Ped wardin's Bailiwick to be seized in manu Regis ,- but allowed him to replevy it. Several of William Crasset's evil deeds are narrated in this Assize-Roll, for instance, he had embezzled 6s. (the value of the Chattels of a Robber) at a Sheriff's Tourn.

Twenty nine Manors in Shrop shire, and several in Staffordshire and Warwickshire now owned his sway, and were held by him under Earl Roger de Montgomery. Soon after William the Conqueror's death (Sept. 9, 1087), Pan tulf again visited Apulia. On this occasion he brought back, for the Monks of St. Peter at Noron, certain relics of St. Nicholas the Confessor,1 which were greatly prized by those Monks, and were indeed found to be of more than theoretical value. This gift took place in June 1092. Besides this, William Pantulf still continued to assist the Monks of Noron, with money for their buildings. His grant of the Manor and Church of Drayton in Shropshire to the same Norman Monastery will be a subject of future argument, in asmuch as Ordericus calls the place Traditon? There is no evidence as to what treatment William Pantulf re ceived at the hands of Earl Hugh de Montgomery, while the latter bore sway in Shropshire : but when Robert de Belesme succeeded to the Earldom, Pantulf suffered an absolute forfeiture. Probably they had already been in collision in Normandy, for Belesme, as his Mother's heir, will have held the castle of which Pantulf had been deprived. Perhaps also Belesme's suspicions in respect of his mo ther's death had not been obliterated by Pantulf s compurgation. The son too much resembled the Mother to forget either her or her private animosities. When in the Autumn of 1102 the Rebel, Belesme, was threatened by the preparations of King Heury, the disinherited Pantulf is said by Ordericus to have proffered his services, in the first instance, to the Earl. The Earl spurned the offer with contempt, and Pantulf resorted to the King. Henry, well knowing the value of such aid, instantly appointed Pantulf to the command of 200 soldiers and to the custody of Stafford Castle. Belesme, till the day of his fall, found iu Pantulf a steady and successful enemy. \u2014 \" None, whether by contrivances or by arms, did him greater injury.\" At length it was by Pantulf's negotiations with his own relatives, the Defen ders of Bridgnorth, that that stronghold was surrendered to King Henry. In a general way it may be stated that William Pantulf by his allegiance to King Henry regained his Domesday possessions. That 1 Two fragments of the Saint's tomb, and the whole of one of his teeth.

His policy was to depress it. All that I can learn further of the career of William Pantulf is from a passage of Ordericus, written with remarkable consistency as to date and probability. \u2014 \" In the year from our Lord's Incarnation 1112, Indiction 5, 12 Henry I., and 4 Louis of France, the said William, in the fortieth year since that in which he had commenced a monastic Cell at Noron, came to Uticum, and mindful of ancient friendliness and gifts (above re corded) reviewed them all, and in a general assembly of the Monks confirmed them, with Leclina, his wife.\" \u2014 \"Then also Philip, and Ivo, and Arnulf,his sons, conceded whatever their Father had given to St. Evroul, and, simultaneously with their father and mother, placed the gifts upon the altar.\" \u2014 I cannot imagine that William Pantulf lived long after this re cognition. Ordericus gives April 16 as the day of his obit, and September 21st as the day of his wife's obit, but does not state the year in either case. They were both buried in the Cloisters of Noron. They left four sons, Philip, Robert, Ivo, and Arnulf, \" none of them,\" says Ordericus, \" emulative of their parents' vir tues in respect of the Church.\" Phibp succeeded to his father's Norman possessions, Robert to his English Fief. Robert Pantulf, heir to the English possessions of his house, had, it seems, acquired some notoriety previous to his father's de cease. Soon after the death of King William I., a Nunnery at Caen was pillaged, and Robert Pantulf's name figures among the Marauders.3 This fact, which could not but be known to Orderic us, perhaps induced the contrast which he makes between the first and second generation of Pantulfs. There is a very ancient grant to Shrewsbury Abbey by William, Constable of Chester. All that I need say of it here is that it passed before 1130, that the first witness is Robert Pantulf, and the last witness is Ivo Pantulf. Robert Pantulf had a brother and a son, both named Ivo. It was his son, I imagine, who thus attested. The Bedfordshire Pipe-Roll of 1130 contains the following notice of a recent Fine. \u2014 Hugo Malbaeng reddit compotum de vij marcis argenti pro placito Duelli inter eum et Robertum Pantulf.

Why the above Fine should be entered under Bedfordshire I cannot say, nor can I state the precise meaning of the Fine ; \u2014 whether it was to se cure a trial by wager-of-battle, or to compound for the nonfulfil ment of such an engagement. That Hugh Malbanc and Robert Pantulf had been or were personal foes is at any rate clear. Ivo Pantulf, probably the son, and clearly the successor of Ro bert, comes into notice before the death of Henry I. He attests, between 1130 and 1135, a confirmation of the Church of Stone (Staffordshire) and of land at Walton, to Kenilworth Priory. The person confirming is Nicholas, second Baron Stafford, under whom I have reason to think that Ivo Pantulf held more than one estate. For instance he will have held Cublesdon (near Stone) under the Barons Stafford, and, as we shall see, transmitted it to a younger son. Also, as we have seen already,1 Ivo Pantulf was, in the reign of Stephen, Mesne-Lord of Stallington (near Stone), and this I conceive must have been a Tenure under the same Barons. Thirdly, Ivo Pantulf was Mesne-Lord of Bagnal (near Newcastle, Stafford shire), and there again I doubt not that the Lord Stafford was his Suzerain. Ivo Pantulf 's grant to Shrewsbury Abbey, between 1141 and 1155, has been discussed already ? so has his Confirmation of Robert de Eyton's grant to the same House. Between 1155 and 1160 two Charters of the first William fitz Alan have the attestation of Ivo Pantulf. Though a Baron himself, he was Fitz Alan's Feoffee at Sheriff Hales, a fact alluded to in the Feodary of 1165, where Two Pantoy is entered as holding half a new fee in Fitz Alan's Barony.3 In 1167 Sheriff Hales had been amerced half a merk by Alan de Nevill. It is described by its owner's name, viz. as Hales Ivonis Pantul. The Staffordshire Pipe-Roll of the same year gives the same Justiciar as inflicting a Fine of 60s. on Ivo de Panton him self. In 1176 the Staffordshire Pipe-Roll mentions Geoffrey de Codewalton and William Purcel, \"two men of Yvo Pantulf\" who had been amerced 2 merks by the King for Forest-Trespass.4 This is the latest mention I have of Ivo Pantulf as living, if indeed he was yet alive ; for, about this time, his son Hugh appears upon the public stage.

These places are now known as Shifford's Grange, Broom-Hall Grange, and Cliff Grange. The two first were probably members of Pantulf's Staf fordshire Manor of Almington, the third was probably a part of his Shropshire Manor of Sutton.3 Ivo Pantulf s grant to Haughmond Abbey must be taken as a closing act of his life, and to have passed in 1175-6, when William fitz Alan who assented thereto was first of age. It was of Hide, a member of Sheriff Hales ; but I give it in the original Latin. Omnibus Sanct\u00e6 Ecclesi\u00e6 filiis tarn futuris quam modo vivis, tarn Francis quam Anglis, Ivo Pantul salutem.

Of these, William and Norman seem to have been his sons by Alice de Verdon, probably a daughter of Norman de Verdon. These two had, apparently from their Mother, some property at Rudyard in Staffordshire.5 Each of them also obtained from their father an estate at Sheriff Hales. Moreover William had an estate at Cublesdon, so that he is sometimes styled of Cublesdon, sometimes of Hales.

He had been married at least five years before his Father's death, to Christiana fitz Alan, daughter of that William fitz Alan who died in 1160, leaving his son in minority. The proof of this marriage is a very complex one, but of exceeding interest. \u2014 From March 3 to June 24, 1170, King Henry II. was in England. About that time he issued a Writ to Guy le Strange, then Custos of the Fitz-Alan estates, authorizing the said Guy to deduct from the annual ferm of those estates a sum of \u00a310, viz. the issues of the Manor of Badminton (Gloucestershire), \"which the King had assigned as the marriage portion of William fitz Alan's daughter.\" In the current year (1170) the Custos dis charges his liabilities of =\u20ac5 on this account ; \u2014 that is the said grant took effect about Easter 1170, and only absorbed half a year's pro portion of the revenue assigned. In other years, and till 1175, when Guy le Strange's custody ceased, he deducts at the full rate of \u00a310 per annum, for the ferm of Badminton, no longer received by him. That Fitz Alan's daughter was married in 1170, we gather from another charge by Guy le Strange. \u2014 In obedience to the King's order he charges \u00a37 on the Fitz-Alan receipts ; which sum he had advanced for the Lady's wardrobe (pro pannis) . That it was Hugh Pantulf who married Fitz-Alan's daughter there can be no doubt ; for between the years 1215 and 1218 the said Hugh, with the as sent of his heirs, gave to Lilleshull Abbey all his right in the Church of Badminton.2 But to return. \u2014 In 1175-6, we have seen Hugh Pantulf attest ing a Charter of King Henry II. at Shrewsbury.3 In 1178, as right in the Church 1 Witham Pantulf of Cublesdon and tronilla.

At Michaelmas 1179, or soon after, and probably on the death of Guy le Strange, Hugh Pantulf was appointed to the Shrievalty of Shropshire. This, I doubt not, was with reference to his connection with the Fitz Alans, for the office was quasi-hereditary, though the Fitz Alan of that day was hardly old enough to undertake it. Pantulf held it for ten years, viz. till Michaelmas 1189, when his latest ac count was rendered, and his Brother-in-law (William fitz Alan II.) obtained it. In his attestations of Charters, which passed during the period of his Shrievalty, Hugh Pantulf is seldom styled Vicecomes. In one instance, perhaps as early as 1180, he attests a transaction with Hameline and Brice his brothers.2 In January 1190, Hugh Pantulf appears in the Court of King Richard at Westminster.3 It is not, I think, improbable, that he was one of those, who, soon afterwards, accompanied the King to Palestine. We have heard how King Richard bestowed seven Librates of Crown-land on Hugh Pantulf.4 In the Herefordshire Pipe-Roll of 1197, five Librates of the seven are assigned, by mis take, in Stottesdune, a Manor which could only appear, as thus charged, in a Shropshire Pipe- Roll. The Herefordshire Pipe-Roll of 1198, is more correct in assigning 100 solidates of land to Hugh Pantulf, in Stanford. We have seen how King Richard's full grant of seven librates was afterwards made up elsewhere.4 The successive Shrievalties of Hugh Pantulf and William fitz Alan (II.) resulted in an enormous deficiency of stores and stock, in the King's Castles and Manors. We have seen how the question of liability was eventually decided between the brothers-in-law and the Crown, and the favour with which Hugh Pantulf 's delinquencies were regarded by King John.6 On August 1204, Robert Corbet and Hugh Pantulf were King John's messengers to Gwenwynwyn, Prince of Powis, for whom they were to ensure a safe-conduct to the English Court.6 In 1206, we find Hugh Pantulf in the King's Court at Nottingham. At this time his younger sons, Ivo and Hugh, were Grantees of the King, in the way pointed out under Stottesden.7 Hugh Pantulf s grant to Shrewsbury Abbey, in which he makes 1 Baronage, I. 434.

I have noticed it more fully under Sutton.1 I now turn to the various Scutages, assessed upon Hugh Pantulf, and to the question of his tenure being per baroniam. His Fief (that which he held in capite) was fiscally reputed to consist of five knights' -fees, three in Shropshire and two in Staffordshire. Hence, in 1194, he paid \u00a33 in Shropshire, and \u00a32 in Staffordshire, to the Scutage for King Richard's Redemption. The same thing followed in 1195-7 with respect to the two scutages of Normandy. I find no variation of this assessment, in the first scutage of King John (levied in 1199, at 2 merks per fee), in the second scutage of King John (levied in 1201, at the same rate), or in the third scutage (levied in 1202, at the same rate) . To the fourth scutage, that of 1203, Hugh Pantulf was assessed 10 merks in Shropshire alone, that is, his whole Barony was brought into one account. To the fifth scutage, levied in 1204, at the rate of 2\\ merks, Hugh Pantulf is not assessed at all. A Writ-Close of July 24, 1205, addressed to the Sheriff of Shropshire, empowers William Pantulf to receive his Father's scutage ;\" consequently we find Hugh Pantulf entered on the Pipe-Roll as having had quittance per breve ofthe sixth scutage. Of the seventh Scutage, levied in 1206, he was also acquitted. So also in 1214, were the five fees of Hugh Pantulf released by Writ from the scutage of Poitou. To the first scutage of Henry III. (assessed at 2 merks per fee in 1218) Hugh Pantulf stands liable on the Pipe-Roll; but a Writ- Close (about October 1217) makes it apparent that he had been entitled to gather his own scutage.3 A Writ of February 1221, again empowers Hugh Pantulf to collect his own Scutage;4 and his name does not appear in the Scutage of Biham, levied in the same year. In 1224, he is entered as exempt from the two scutages of Montgomery and Bedford. Meanwhile a Tenure-Roll, of the year 1211, speaks of Hugh Pan tulf as follows.- \u2014 Under Staffordshire he is put down as holding two fees in capite by knight's service. Under Shropshire these two fees must be included in the clause which states that \" Hugh Pantulf, Baron, is a Tenant-in-capite of the King, and owes the ser vice of five knights.\"6 On December 28, 1224, Hugh Pantulf was dead, and the King had received the homage of William, his son and heir.6 The Sheriff 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 364. 5 Testa de Nevill, pp. 54, 55. 6 Rot.

I cannot quit Hugh Pantulf 's name without attempting to enu merate his children, and saying something more about his wife. I take it that she was the daughter of William fitz Alan (I.), not by Isabel de Say, but by his first wife, Christiana, niece of Robert the Consul. That Pantulfs wife was named Christiana, is a strong ar gument in favour of the above supposition. We hear of no less than five sons of Hugh Pantulf, viz. William, Ivo, Alan, Hugh,1 and one, the initial letter of whose name was R., and who was a Prebendary of Bridgnorth.3 As to Hugh Pantulfs daughters, I cannot but think that Emma, wife of Robert Corbet of Caus, was one of them. William Pantulf (II.) , with whom we now proceed, had come into notice long before his father's death. \u2014 As early as the year 11 94,- there is an entry on the Staffordshire Pipe- Roll, to the effect that WiUiam fitz Alan owed 10 merks as Surety for his Nephew, and that payment of the debt was to be sought in Shropshire. Ac cordingly in later Rolls we find the charge renewed under Shrop shire. I cannot explain the entry further, but I may say that I know of no nephew of Fitz Alan's who can have been old enough thus to appear, unless it were William Pantulf. In 1205, we see William Pantulf receiving his father's scutage, doubtless in respect of personal services to King John, while his brothers, Ivo and Hugh, have grants of land at Stottesden. I conclude it to have been William Pantulf of Wem, who served as a Knight in King John's Irish Campaign of 1210. Thus, in June and July, we find him favoured with various Pr\u00e6stita at Kilkenny, at Cells, at Carrickfer gus, Fowre, and Dublin.3 Nineteen years afterwards, that is in 1229, these Pr\u00e6stita, amounting to \u00a38.

In January 1215, we read of 10 merks being paid to Henry fitz Count, Hugh Pantulf, and William his brother, by a trusted agent of King John. There is not a symptom, that the sons of Hugh Pantulf halted in their al legiance to the Crown at this critical period. On December 14, 1225, William Pantulf is named first of the Commissioners who were in February following to render account at Westminster of the tax of the fifteenth as levied in Salop and Staffordshire.1 On May 14, 1226, King Henry III. reduced William Pantulfs Relief from \u00a3100 to =\u00a325, \" because it had been declared before the King that Pantulf only held five fees in capite, of the King's Escheats, which were once Robert de Belesme's.\"3 On December 26, 1226, a Writ-Close orders that the variances, which subsisted between William Pantulf and Madoc ap Griffin (of Bromfield), should be settled at Oswestry, on a fixed day, and by arbitration of John fitz Alan, John le Strange, Bartholomew Turet, Robert de Girros and the Sheriff of Shropshire.3 A Writ of July 21, 1228, orders the Sheriff to give effect to a Perambulation which had been made between the Manors of Prees and Wem, under Royal Precept.4 William Pantulfs name appears on the Scutage-rolls of his time as follows. In 1229, he was assessed at 10 merks, on 5 fees, to the scutage of Keri, but had subsequent acquittance by Writ Royal. On levy of the scutage of Brittany, at 3 merks per fee, in 1230, William Pantulf fined 25 merks as a composition pro passagio et scutagio de v militibus ne fiat miles hac vice. I infer from this that the composition covered his scutage and exempted him from personal service. I cannot further conclude that one who had long occupied so prominent a position as William Pantulf was not yet a Knight. In 1231, Wilbam Pantulf was assessed at \u00a310 to 5 fees for the scutage of Poitou, and in 1232, was acquitted by Writ of the Scu tage of Elvein. On February 4, 1233, William Pantulf was dead, for then did Fulk fitz Warin give the King 600 merks for custody of his lands and heirs.6 The said heirs were, as I find from later evidence, two daughters, Matilda and Elizabeth ; but as we have no coeval mention of Elizabeth we may presume that she died unmarried, and soon after her father. 1 \u2022 \" Rot.

It contained 4-\\ fees in Shropshire, and 3 fees in Staffordshire. \u2014 There is some discrepancy between the several lists,3 but whereas Ralph Pincernator or Le Botiler is set down as holding one fee in Wem and Hinstock (Shropshire), and one fee in Alcminton (Staffordshire), we may conclude that he was already seized of the demesne-estates of the Barony and had married Matilda Pantulf. Certainly, as I have proved under Alberbury, such a marriage had taken place before 1243. On April 24, 1245,\u2014 Ra\u00a3ph le Botyler and Matilda his wife fine half a merk for a Pr\u00e6cipe (to remove some suit at law) from the County of Salop to Westminster.4 In the same year they fine one merk pro haben da jurata. Both these fines were probably incidental to the suit noticed under Corselle.5 In this same year, 100*., due on 5 fees to the Aid on marriage of the Princess Royal, are charged to the name of William Pantulf; but an interlineation (viz. Rad. le Butiler habet filiam et heredem) shows that there was a cotemporary sense ofthe error. And in 1246, when the 5 fees of Wem are marked as quit of the scutage of Gannok, the person acquitted is \" Ralph le Buteiler who has William Pantulfs heir to wife.\" In 1252, we have Ralph le Butiler and Margaret (read Matilda) his wife fining one merk for a writ of Pone. This probably related to a suit, which, on Novem ber 3, 1253, was heard at Westminster.6 \u2014 \"Ralph le Butiler and Matilda his wife sued William del Atre for 7 acres of bosc in Wemme, as the right of Matilda, whereof Hugh de Pantun, Ma tilda's grandfather,7 was once seized.

In 1254, Ralph le Butiler was assessed \u00a310 on 5 fees to the Aid for knighting Prince Edward; but, in 1250, he had quittance from a like assessment to the scutage of Wales. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 supplies the following information. \u2014 \" Ralph le Botiler is Lord of Weme, and holds the whole Manor in capite of the King, viz. as a Baron : and he does due suit by his Seneschal to County and Hundred, for his whole Barony, except that for Upton (Waters Upton) and Eiton (Eyton) he does no suit : aud he has a Park and Warren, the Jurors know not by what title. The Manor (of Wem) is xnn hides.\" \" Ralph le Butiler also took advowries and emends of warren, by a title unknown.\"1 At the Assizes of 1256, the Grand Assize between Ralph and Maud Botyler and William del Ake, concerning 7 acres of bosc, was compounded by license, the Defendant paying a fine of 1 merk pro licentia concordandi. By a Fine levied at these same Assizes, Ralph and Matilda le Butyller grant a carucate in Wemme to Richard le Butyller, to hold, with other privileges in the Manor (excepting the bosc and park of Brochurst), to him and his lawful issue, by a rent of gilt spurs ; \u2014 with remainder to Ralph and Matilda and the heirs of Matilda. On October 2, 1261, the King allows by Patent the proposed marriage of Ankaret, niece of James de Audley, to William, son of Ralph le Butiller.

However, when we proceed to enumerate the several Manors which are known to have been involved with Wem. in 1255, and are either unmen tioned or unhidaged in the Hundred-Eoll, we get a complement far in excess of the 14 hides which we should expect. \u2014 Eor instance, AVem proper (4 hides), Horton (2 hides), Edstaston (2 hides), Aston (1 hide), Cotton (2 hides), Harpcote (i hide), Wolverley (3 hides), and Alkington (li hides), contain in Domesday an aggregate measurement of 15-J hides. Besides these, there were the Domesday Manors of Tir ley (1 hide), Edgeley (1 hide), and Steel (1 hide), which, not being mentioned in the Hundred-Eoll of 1255, were perhaps also accounted members of Wem. \u2014 The inference is, what I have often before pointed out, viz. that where the Domesday arrangement was allowed to be tampered with, the result was always a diminution of aggregate hidage, and so a loss to the Crown and a gain to the Tenant."], [201, "171 AVEM sion, cost the Vassal half a merk, for license to levy it, and a sore hawk, given to the Recognizors. I might say much more of Ralph le Botyler and his Ancestors, the Lords of Oversley in Warwickshire; but the subject belongs to the history of another county. The Writ oi Diem clausit on his death, bears date July 3, 1281. He was found to have held the Manor of Wem, of the inheritance of Matilda his wife, still surviving. A Fortalice, gardens, and two Parks, were among the adjuncts ofthe Manor.1 The fenced Park only contained 10 beasts of chace ; the other, unfenced, contained none. Here were two Water Mills and one Windmill. The Tenants in villeinage were bound to execute all Castle-works at the will of the Lord. The Pleas and Perquisites of the Manor-Court realized the unusual sum of 100s. per annum. The deceased had held Wem, Hinstock, and Tirley, by service of three knights in the army of Wales, for 40 days at his own cost. He had held, says the Re cord, nothing else in Shropshire or Staffordshire save the above, neither in capite nor otherwise. His gross income was computed at \u00a357. 5s. 2d. per annum? Matilda Pantulf, Baroness of Wem, now remarried with \u2014 Walter de Hopton, a person of some eminence in the Law, and already associated with Shropshire. It will suffice here to state that on August 4, 1258, a Patent of Henry III.'s appoints Thomas de Roshall, Walter de Hopton, Richard Tyrel, and Robert de Lacy Justiciars to inquire concerning disturbances (excessibus) in Shrop shire, according to an ordinance of the Parliament of Oxford. For the year ending Michaelmas 1268, Walter de Hopton had served the office of Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire,3 though his account was not rendered till Michaelmas 1269, and then in con junction with that of William de Caverswell his Successor. In Lent 1277, I find Walter de Hopton sitting as a Justiciar at Ludlow with Ralph de Hengham. In Easter Term 1283, a Fine was levied whereby Walter de Hopton and his wife Matilda give the Manors of Wemme and Tyrle to one 1 One item of manorial receipt is ex pressed as follows : \u2014 Passagium cum po turd Satellitum valet 40s. \u2014 I suppose that Traders and Travellers who passed through AVem had to pay a toll (passa gium), as well as to contribute something towards the maintenance of the T6ll keepers.

It is a mere error as regards the Christian name."], [202, "172 WEM Roger le Rus. He in turn settles them on the Grantors ; \u2014 to hold of the King, for Matilda's life. If Hopton survived his wife, Wemme was nevertheless to pass to her right heirs ;\u2014 to hold of the King, by accustomed services, and the holder paying an annuity of \u00a315 to Hopton, viz. for Horton, Tilnleye (Tilley), and Aston, members of Wemme. Hopton was to hold Tirleye (Staffordshire) for his life, and immediately of the King. At his death Tirleye and the aforesaid annuity were to revert to the right heirs of Matilda. This Fine was levied by consent and will of the King : and Le Rus quit claimed all right in Wem and Tirleye, to Walter and Matilda and the heirs of Matilda.1 Such was the mode in which Matilda le Botyler contrived to make a settlement on her second husband. The Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1286) says that \"Walter de Hopton, through his wife Matilda, holds the Manor of Wem with its members, viz. Aston, Stiell, Tilley, Dichelowe,2 Horton, Wol- verley, Edistoston (Edstaston), Coton, Harpecote, Beslow, Dodyng- ton, Alkynton, and Edisley. He also holds the Manors of Hin- stocke, Upton (Waters Upton), Tibrighton, Dawley (Magna), Eton (Eyton), Brocketon (Bratton), and half the vill of Dawley (read Lawley), and half the vill of Parva Drayton of the King, in capite sine medio, freely, as a Barony, by service of three knights' - fees in lieu of all services : and he has at Wem, a Market and Fair, by Charter of King Henry III. He also holds there his free court, twice yearly, and has pleas of bloodshed and hue-and-cry, and gallows : and these franchises he has used for long time.\" At the Assizes of 1292 it was presented that Walter de Hopton, still living, was one of the Sheriffs who had been in office since the last Eyre (that of 1272). The Pipe-Rolls do not allow such a mode of dating Hopton's Shrievalty. Before these Assizes, Matilda Pantulf seems to have died. Though her second husband still retained Hins'tock, he was not apparently seized thereof at the time of his death in 1305. He left a son Walter, two years of age at the father's decease,3 and of course the child of a later wife than Maud Pantulf, who cannot have been less than fifty when she married Hopton. I may now return to \u2014 William le Botyler, eldest son of Matilda Pantulf and Ralph le Botyler. We have seen that about 1261 he married Ankaret, niece of James de Audley.4 They had a son John, born on July 17, 1266 or 1267, for the Inquests vary as to the year of his birth. 1 Fines divers.

It should be noted that Ralph le Botiler himself was another of the three knights, and John de Brumpton the third. In the Welsh campaign of 1282, William le Boteler was ordered to serve under Roger de Mortimer, as Commander-in chief. In the same year, in consequence of his tenures, he is no ticed as liable to provide certain ward for Shrewsbury Castle, and he served personally on behalf of \" Matilda de Pantolf, Lady of Wem,\" his mother. Again in 1283 he was ordered to be at Mont gomery on May 3, prepared for service in Wales, and on September 30th of that year he was to attend a Parliament at Shrewsbury, being addressed as \"William le Botiller de Wemme.\"1 King Edward's Writ, announcing the death of William le Botiler of Weme, bears date at Leominster on Dec. 11, 1283. Besides his paternal estates at Oversley, he had enjoyed lands &c. at Dudinton (Dodington), which yielded an annual revenue of \u00a312. 6s. 10^d., and a messuage &c. at Lopington which yielded \u00a32. 19s. &\\d. John, his eldest son and heir, was 17 years of age, \u2014 more or less, according as the several Inquests differ.3 At the Assizes of 1292 the Bradford Jurors presented that Age haret, widow of William le Botiller, held \u00a310 rents in Dodynton, and being a widow in the King's gift had remarried with Robert de Nevyle. Robert de Nevyle appeared and proved the King's grant of the said marriage to himself. John le Botiler of Wemme, to whom I now return, seems really to have been born on July 17, 1266, for at his death in July 1287 he was seized of his paternal estates in Warwickshire. The King's Writ of Diem clausit on John le Botiler's death is dated Oct. 20, 1287, and the Warwickshire Inquest, which followed, found that Gawan, brother and heir of the deceased, was 17 years osage on February 2nd, 1287.3 But a previous Writ had issued on July 23, 1287, ordering the age of Alienore, widow of John le Botiller, to be ascertained. This child, whom I take to have been a daughter of Walter, Lord Beau champ of Powyke, seems to have completed her twelfth year on November 11th, next after her husband's death.4 Gawan le Botiler had livery of the Barony of Wem before he 1 Parliamentary Writs, I. 485. 2 Inquisitions, 12 Edw.

But death was ever busy in the house of Botiler, and Gawan died at the age of twenty. A Writ of March 21, 1290, announces this event, and an Inquest was held at Shrewsbury, on April 7th following, as to his estate.1 Some new particulars now transpired as to the tenure and other circumstances of the Manor of Wem. The Lord was to furnish one Setter {brachetum) yearly to the King, to do suit to both the Hundreds of Bradford and Pymhill, every three weeks, and to the County, monthly. Wem Castle was in a ruined state. A rent called Kylh was worth 70s. per annum to the deceased Lord. Four Boses pertained to the Manor, viz. Brochhurst, Le Holde Park, Northwode, and Newe Park. Certain adjacent vills paid the following dues, viz. Tilnelegh (Tilley) for pasture in the Olde Park, 2s. 6d. ; Legh, for pasture in Brochirste, 3s. 6d. ; and Clive, for ingress into the boses, paid 8 quarters of oats and 29 plough-shares yearly. A passage {i. e. a toll upon traders who passed Wem) realized 6s. 8d. per annum. The gross income of the Manor was \u00a354. 19s. 10c?. : out of which Sir Walter de Hopton was henceforth to receive \u00a315 yearly, for ser vices rendered in the Curia. Regis. The Advowson of Wem Church, worth 40 merks per annum, and two-thirds of a messuage and estate at Loppington, worth \u00a31. 19s. Sd. yearly, were also parcels of the estate of which Gawen le Botiler had died seized. William le Bo tiler, his brother and heir, would be 16 years of age on June 11, 1290. Gawan le Botiler left a widow, Alice, who in October 1292, was holding 30 librates of revenue in Wem, of the inheritance of William, son of William, and brother of Gawan, le Botiler, and was at the King's disposal as regarded any second marriage. William le Botiler (IL), the heir in question, was a Minor in October 1292, and, the Bradford Jurors said, was heir to 30 librates in Wem which his Father, William, had held in capite. (His Father had obviously never been seized of such an estate.) The Minor was now in custody of Walter de Beauchamp (of Powyk I presume), who had the wardship from John de Bretagne, who had it from the King. The Bradford Jurors further presented that William le Botiler claimed free-warren in Wem. On May 8, 1293, William, \" brother and heir of Gawan le Boti ler,\" being as yet in minority, complained in the Curia, Regis of the wastes and sales made by Walter de Hopton in respect of houses and woods, which he only held for life. One thousand oak-trees 1 Inquisitions, 18 Edw. I., No. 30."], [205, "175 WEM and a house at Alkementon1 had been sold. The oaks were worth 3s. each, but the damage altogether was only laid at \u00a360. Hopton's defence was that he did not hold the wasted estates, as alleged, for a term of years. The Guardian of William le Botiler afterwards withdrew his action by license of the Court.2 William le Botiller of Wem was among those summoned to per form military service in Flanders, the muster being at London on Feb. 2, 1298. A similar summons to serve against the Scots di rected him to be at York on May 25, of the same year. In 1301 there were two musters against the Scots returnable on June 24, one at Berwick-upon-Tweed, to serve under the King, the other at Carlisle, to serve under Prince Edward. William le Butiller of Wemme was directed to attend the second in lieu of the first.3 On June 24, 1302, William le Botiler of Wemme (Plaintiff in a Fine), receives a carucate in Wemme from Richard le Botiler (De forciant), to whom he concedes the same for life, at a rose-rent. Between March 10, 1308, and January 24, 1326, I find more than eighty Writs of Edward II. addressed to William le Botiller of Wem as a Parbamentary Baron, a Tenant by military service, a Justice of Assize, a Conservator of the Peace, or a Commander of levies.4 He served probably both in Scotland and France. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, he is set down as Lord of Wemme, Wy cheshale (Whixall), and Hinstock (in Bradford Hundred), and of Almington (in Staffordshire), all being, I presume, held by him in demesne. An Inquest held pursuant to a Writ of April 24, 1327, found that it would not injure the Crown if William le Botyler of Wemme was to enfeoff one William Hereward, Parson of Weston Turvill, in the Manor of Dodyton, so that the said Trustee should forthwith settle it on William le Botyler for life, with remainder to John le Strange of Blancminster and Ankeret his wife, and their bodily heirs, or, in default of such heirs, with remainder to the right heirs of William le Botyler. Dodyton was held in capite by one-third of a knight's-fee, and was worth 4 merks per annum. Two-thirds of the Manors of Wemme aud Hynestock, worth \u00a360 per annum, would remain to William le Botyler after the proposed settlement.5 Ankeret, here mentioned, was daughter of William le Botyler by his second wife, Ela, daughter and coheir of Roger de Hardeburgh. 1 Amington, Staffordshire. 2 Placita coram Rege, 21 Edw.

The Inquest taken on his death is much defaced; but an ancient notice thereof enumerated the Warwickshire Manors of Oversleye and Marshton Boteler, the Staffordshire Manor of Tyrley, and the Shropshire Manors of Wem, Hinstock, and Dodyngton.3 William le Botiler (III.) was son and heir of the last Wil liam, bv a former wife, and was aged 36 at his Father's death. On July 5th, 1343, it was found by Inquest to be no injury to the Crown if William le Botiller of Wemme were to enfeoff William, son of William le Botiller {i. e. his own son) and his wife Elizabeth, in the Manor of Lopynton, entailing it on them and their male heirs, with remainder to himself and his heirs. Lopington, Wemme, Hinstock, Dudynton (which was in the hand of John le Strange by grant of William le Butiler, deceased), and Tirley were all held in capite by service of 3 knights'-fees. The Jurors added that, after such settlement, no lands would remain to the proposed Grantor.3 The expression refers to this and another settlement (which has been given under Hinstock4) , when taken conjunctively. The same two Inquests, when collated, will show how rightly it was said on the death of William le Botyler III. (which took place Dec. 18, 1361) that he had died seized of nothing in demesne. As to Wem, Tyrley, and Hinstock, he held them in fee-tail ; and of course his son and heir, William, already seized of Loppington, took posses sion of those three manors, under the said entail. On this occasion the knight's service, due distinctively on Wem and the Advowson thereof, was stated to be two-thirds of a fee.6 William le Botiler (IV), aged 30 at his Father's death, died as I have before said on August 14, 1369.6 Besides the Writ of Diem clausit which followed on August 20th, another Writ of Au gust 25 directs the Escheator to make special inquiry about entails on the heirs male of the deceased. The Inquests are very full and accurate on the point. \u2014 \" Lopyngton was entailed on the deceased and Elizabeth his late wife and their heirs male ;\" but as there was a remainder to the heirs of the father of the deceased, it is obvious that this entail on heirs male cannot have barred the claim of Eliza beth, only daughter of the deceased.

WEM CHUECH. There is no symptom of a Church existing here at the time of Domesday, but neither, if we suppose Wem Church to have been at its foundation a Chapel, is it easy to assign its Mother Church. The Manorial Lords were probably its Founders, and they continued to be its Patrons. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Wemme (in the Deanery of Salop) ,at \u00a313. 6s. 8^. per annum? In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth, quoting this Taxation of 20 merks, rated the Parish at \u00a311 only. They said that \u00a33. 6s. 8d. of tbe Church- Taxation consisted of income, not computable in ascertaining the value of the Ninth? The Valor of 1534-5 gives the income of John Dacre, Rector of Wemme, as \u00a326. 13s. 4<i. per annum, less 9s. for Synodals and Procurations.4 EAELY INCUMBENTS.

And this Ranulph de Harpcote, who occurs in various re lations in 1256, 1272, and 1284,3 was, I think, Lord of Harpcote; for the Tenure-Roll of 1286, says of Harpecote and Stiell, members of Wem, that Ranulf de Harpecote held them for half a knight's fee under Walter and Matilda de Hopton.

On the death of John fitz Aer in 1293, the In quest makes a statement, slightly differing from the above, but by so much nearer to Domesday. It says that \"he had held 1-g virgates and 1 noke in Wythyfor.d of the Fee of Wemme, by serjeantry, viz. to provide one man with bow and arrows, at Wemme, in time of war.\" The Inquest on the death of Hugh fitz Aer in December 1313, again varies the extent of his tenure and nature of his service. \u2014 \" He had held half Withyford under Sir William le Botyler, by service of one man with a lance, at Wemme, for 20 days, in time of war with Wales ; and if the garrison {garnistura) should go out of the Castle (of Wem), the aforesaid lancer was still to abide therein, to keep watch over the fire {ad custodiendum ignem) .\"3 I know nothing further of the tenure of this part of Withyford.

I cannot explain why Domesday calls the larger a Berewick, especially when the men tion of a Priest indicates that there was a Church there. Ordericus calls Drayton Traditon, and relates how William Pantulf, return ing from his third visit to Apulia, bestowed the Manor, the Mill, the Church, and the tithes of six vills, which pertained to the said Church of Traditon, on the Monks of Noron.2 The date of this gift is not quite clear; but I take it to have passed in the first twelve years of the twelfth century. Now the House of St. Peter at Norun, had been founded by William Pantulf himself, as a Cell of the great Norman Abbey of St. Evroul, and his gift of Drayton became in effect a gift to the Parent Abbey. The Proctor or Ma nager of the English estates of St. Evroul was the Prior of Ware, a Cell of St. Evroul situated in Hertfordshire. Combermere Abbey was founded about 1133; and it became the interest of the Com bermere Monks to accept a perpetual lease of the Manor of Dray ton, from the Prior of Ware, or from his Principal, the Abbot of St. Evroul. The date of this arrangement must have been early in the 13th century. Subsequent Records uniformly speak of the Monks of Combermere as Lords of Drayton, and it is evident that under their auspices the place increased in trading importance and became a town rather than an agricultural estate. On November 8, 1245, King Henry III. being at Worcester grants to Simon Ab bot of Combermere, the privilege of holding a weekly Market, on Tuesdays, at his Manor of Draiton; \u2014 also of holding an annual Fair on* the eve, the day, and the morrow of the Nativity of the Virgin (Sept. 7, 8, 9) ; \u2014 also Blodwite and Inf ang thes ;\u2014 also quit- 1 Domesday, fo. 257, a, 2.

The Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1285) says that \"the Abbot of Cumbermere holds the vill of Drayton, in pure alms, of the Barony of Wem, and has a Market and Fair by Charter of Henry III.\" The mesne interest of St. Evroul was perhaps un known to the Jurors who furnished this report. The Taxation of 1291 states that the Abbot of Combermere had \u00a310 annual rent in the vill of Drayton.6 At the Assizes of 1292 the Abbot was questioned by Writ of Quo Waranto for his Fran chises at Drayton.7 He defended his right of Market and Fair by Henry III.'s Charter. As to holding two great Courts, equal in jurisdiction to the Sheriffs' Tourns, he defended that by imme morial usage of the Abbots of St. Ebrulph, from whom one of his Predecessors purchased Drayton.

The arrears of this damage, rated at 62s., were now re covered by the Crown, but the Abbot was allowed the franchises for the future, on payment of a Fine of one merk. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, this Vill is called Drayton in le Hales, and the Abbot of Combermere entered as Lord.

Drayton was probably one of the Saxon Parishes of Shropshire,2 and the Priest, resident here at the time of Domesday, was probably Rector of the Church. When William Pantulf gave this Church to St. Peters of Norun, the gift, according to Ordericus, involved the tithes of six Vills. It is difficult to say what vills were here alluded to ; but Magna Dray ton, Sutton, Woodseaves, Buntingsdale, Tyrley, and Almington, will sufficiently correspond with the, perhaps general, expression used by Ordericus. 1 Charters at Adderley. 2 Tradition speaks of Chapels some time existent at Betton-in-Hales and at Hales-Green, in this Parish. These were probably not the only affiliations of Dray ton Church."], [225, "THE CHURCH. 189 The Hundred-Roll of 1255 assigns the Church, as well as the Manor, of Drayton, to Combermere Abbey. However, the Ad vowson was afterwards recovered by the Abbey of St. Evroul. The Taxation of 1291 gives a great idea of the revenues of this Church. The Church of \" Drayton in Hales\" in the Deanery of Newport (that is, the Rectory) was worth \u00a312 per annum, over and above the Pension chargeable thereon.1 The said Pension was \u00a31. 10s. payable to the Abbot of Shrewsbury, and was probably a composition in lieu of certain tithes, abandoned by the Abbot, as Lord of Betton-in-Hales and Richwardine. Besides this, the Vicar age of Drayton in Hales had a separate valuation of \u00a36. 13s. 4rf.2 At the Assizes of 1292 the Abbot of St. Ebrulph was sued for the Advowson of Magna Drayton as having descended to Edward I. from Henry IL, who was now alleged to have presented one John fitz Thomas, his Clerk, thereto. The Abbot appealed to a Jury, which decided his right to be better than that of the King.3 In 1341, the Assessors of the Ninth quoted the Taxation of the Church of Drayton in le Halys as one of \u00a312. This they further reduced to \u00a310 for the current assessment, saying that the glebe land, rents, oblations, mortuaries, and other income of the Church, went to make up the assessment of \u00a312, and had nothing to do with the present tax. To the Ninth, thus computed at \u00a310, the Temporalities of Shrewsbury Abbey (at Little Drayton and Betton, I presume) furnished a quota.4 The Advowson of Market Drayton eventually escheated to the Crown as an Asset of an Alien Monastery. King Henry V. granted to the Carthusians of Sheen (in Surrey), who had it at the Dis solution. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Vicarage, then held by Radulpb Tytteley, as worth \u00a313. 6s. 8d. per annum. The charges on this income were 4s. for Synodals, 8s. for Procurations, 2s. 4d. for an annual pension payable to Tyrley Chapel, and Is. 9d. for another pension payable to the Diocesan Bishop.6 EAELY INCUMBENTS.

The Sheriff went away {rediif), and William Tuder, Ralph le Botiller, and all the rest, betook themselves to the House of the Vicar of Drayton, and departing thence towards Tyrley they came to the steps of the Cemetery of Drayton Church.3 There they met Bro ther Richard de Overton, Thomas, Seneschal of the Prior of Ware, Robert, Vicar of Drayton, Henry, a Vassal of the Prior of Ware, and sixteen others of the Abbot of Combermere's party. A quar rel ensued. One Alan, son of Walter Hody, who had come with William Tuder, on the part of the Prior of Ware, shot Robert Brun, one of the Abbot's men. The latter went home to Dodicote, and died on the fourth day after. His Widow, Alice, brought his body to the place where he had received his death-wound, and the Vicar of Drayton buried it without View of the Coroner.\" Here were at least three matters pertaining to those Placita Co rona for which the Hundred was responsible, viz. the breach of the peace, the manslaughter, and the burial sine visu Coronatoris. But a fourth matter remained, discovered, it appears, by scrutiny of the Coroner's Rolls (his memoranda) . During the fight a Lay -monk3 of Combermere struck Ralph le Botiller's horse. The Baron went to Tyrley and armed himself. Thence, still accompanied by the Posse Comitatus, he proceeded to the Abbot's Grange of Dodicote,4 and beat, wounded, and plundered the Abbot's men.

Inter alia, a Jury of the Hundred had pronounced, or now pronounced, Alan Hody blameless in the affair. As to Robert, Vicar of Drayton, he too was found to have been blameless, but whereas he had fled somewhither, his lay chattels, worth 25s., were confiscated. Henry, the Vassal of the Prior of Ware, had been also challenged as an accessory to Robert Brun's death, by the widow. The said widow was now deceased. The said Henry ap peared in Court, but refused to put himself on trial by Jury. So the Court recommitted him to prison and adjudged him to suffer the statutory penalty {p\u0153nam statuti). The Jury ofthe Hundred, which tried Alan Hody, found John Traynel to have been guilty of the murder. He could not be found, and so was outlawed. From an interlineation in the Record it would seem that he was dead. It is certain from other authority that Ralph le Botiller also had been now dead eleven years, but of that fact the Record takes no notice. There are several other points in the narrative which I do not understand, for instance, the Prior of Ware having representatives on each side of the quarrel. However we have a picture of the times, and of the predicaments of a Baron, a Sheriff, and a Priest, when an ordinary matter of official routine ended in a bloody riot. Walter de Petlings, Priest, was instituted to the Vicarage of Drayton-in-Hales on February 24, 1300, at the presentation of Ralph, Prior of Ware, and Proctor of the Abbot and Convent of St. Ebrulf. The Vicarage is said to have been vacant on June 4, 1328, in consequence of the death of \u2014 John de Pylarton, and on that day \u2014 Gilbert de Onne is said to have been instituted on the presen tation of the Prior of Ware, &c.

William Pantulf had parted with Drayton, the nearest Shropshire Manor to Tirley, but retained Alminton, the nearest Staffordshire Manor. To throw the two latter into the same juris diction was obviously convenient.

The above three Pleas, I should observe, arc all en tered on the Rolls as belonging to Shropshire, a circumstance which suggests a doubt as to whether the annexation of Tirley to Staffordshire was as yet recognized in the Courts of Law. We have seen how, about the year 1280, Ralph le Botiller, in censed by a collision with the Abbot of Combermere's men, in the streets of Drayton, and meditating an onslaught at Dodicote Grange, first retired to Tirley to arm himself. The circumstance is curious, for we happen to know that this very Baron was the Founder of Tirley Castle, and that dying in 1281, he left it incom plete. The Inquest on his death makes Tirley a Shropshire Manor, and part of the inheritance of his wife Matilda. The Manor con tained an unfinished Fortalice {fortelettum inceptum), a messuage, a garden, an ill-fenced Park, and a great wood, which was a Free Chace? From a Staffordshire Feodary of 1284, I find that the Manor of Cublesdon, near Stone, was held by Roese Trussel (she was heiress of Pantulf of Cublesdon and Sheriff Hales), of the Barony of Wem, and that the service due from Cublesdon was that of one foot soldier, to serve eight days at Trileg with bow and arrows. The Inquest on the death of William le Botiler (II.) in 1334, places his Manor of Tyrley in Staffordshire. So does the Inquest Ad quod damnum of 1343, already quoted under Hinstock. Subsequent In quests make the same assignment of Tirley, which was uniformly retained as a demesne Manor by the Barons of Wem : but I need not here repeat particulars about Tirley which have already trans pired. Broom Hall and Shifford. I am not quite clear that one or both of these places may not be considered as originally appurtenant to Tirley rather than to Alminton. Hugh Pantulfs grant of both to Combermere Abbey has already been treated of.2 They both be came Granges of that House and are still called Granges.

Having now disposed of William Pantulfs Domesday Manors in Odenet Hundred, I proceed with the three Manors of Roger de Curcelle, because, as I have remarked under Tibberton and Sutton, all Roger de Curcelle's Manors were eventually annexed to the Barony of Pantulf. \u2014 \" The same Roger de Curcelle holds Dodetune of Earl Roger.

The name Dodington still exists, and the township, so called, contains 1626 acres; a very large area in proportion to the single hide of Domesday. The first notice which I have of Dodington, as annexed to the Barony of Wem, is in the Hundred-Roll of 1255. There, Duthinton, computed to contain 1| hides, is said to be of the Fee of Wem. \" Ralph le Botiler, Lord of the Vill, did suit to County and Hundred through his Seneschal ;\" 3 that is, the suit of the Se neschal of Wem covered any distinct liability of Dodington. The increase of half a hide on the Domesday hidage, which we ob serve here, is unusual ; but if Edgeley and Steel (not mentioned in the Hundred-Roll) were taken into account, three Domesday hides were represented by the alleged 1 J hides. We have heard of the marriage, proposed in 1261, between Ralph le Botiler's son William, and Ankaret, niece of James de Audley.3 Here is a deed fixing their marriage portion. \u2014 Seiant presentes etfuturi quod ego Radulphus le Boteleer Dominus de Wemme et Matildis uxor mea dedimus Willielmo filio nostro et 1 Domesday, fo. 256, a, 2. \"* Rot.

Thereby William Bel-Enfaunt (Fair child), attorney of Ralph le Butyler and Maud his wife (Impedi ents), acknowledges their gift of the Manor of Dodinton to William le Butyler and Ingaretta his wife ;\u2014 to hold to them and the heirs of William, immediately of the King, by accustomed services. For this Fine William is said to have paid a sore goshawk {asturcum sorum) . It was levied by assent and will of the King. I have quoted the Inquest of January 1284, which shows William le Botiler to have died seized of Dudinton and Lopington, and I may here add of Norborough. The Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1286) reckons Dodington, Alkynton, and Edisley (Edgeley) to be members of Wem, but adds that Ankaret, widow of William But teler, held all three, under Walter and Matilda de Hopton. Then follows this ungrammatical and otherwise inaccurate sentence ; \u2014 \" sed homagium facit Willielmus Domino Rege et servicium apud Wem.\" \u2014 It means, I suppose, that the deceased, though the King had accepted his direct homage for Dodington, &c., had been bound to the usual and proportionate service at Wem Castle, and had so far held of the Baron of Wem. We have seen how Ankaret ap Griffin, then the wife of Robert de Nevyle, was holding Dodington in 1292. A Leicestershire Feo dary of 1296 gives Ankaret, widow of William le Boteler, as hold ing Norborough of Ralph le Botiler, while Ralph held of the Earl of Warwick.2 A mistake as to the date (1296) or the name {Ralph) is here apparent. The rest of the quotation is explained by what I have said about Norborough in a former Volume.3 A settlement of Dodyton, as proposed by William le Botyler (II.) in 1327, has been already given under Wem :4 where also I have shown how he died seized of Dodyngton in 1334, and how in 1343 it was held by John le Strange of Whitchurch, in pursuance of the settlement of 1327. Its proximity to Whitchurch, as compared with its distance from Wem, doubtless suggested the said transfer.

After this, from 1226 to 1251, we have repeated notices of another Adam de Dodinton, but only as concerned in South Shropshire.1 We may be sure that Adam de Dorinton, who sat on a Whit church Jury in March 1281, was of the place now under notice. \u00c6tJijelep. \" The same Roger de Curcelle holds Edeslai.

It was held in 1286 by Ankaret widow of William le Boteler, probably in dower. The Undertenants here, were probably those Meverels of whom we have frequent mention in connection with the Barons of Wem. For instance, we have seen Walter Meverel attesting, about 1175-6, Ivo Pantulfs Charters to Shrewsbury and Haughmond Abbeys.3 Among Pleas standing for trial at Shrewsbury in August 1226, Ivo Meverel neglected to prosecute his suits of mort d'ances tre against Roger Meverel for half a virgate in EdesF, and against William Pantulf for half a virgate in the same. In November 1236, the Justices in eyre amerced Thomas Meverel half a merk, for false claim ; and in 1261, Luke Meverel fined one merk for a Writ of Pone, but I cannot say that either of these persons was of Edgeley.

It was also manorially considered a member of Wem. Thus in 1286, Steill and Harpecote were both held by Ranulph de Harpecote, for half a knight's-fee, under Walter and Matilda de Hopton. The Greystock Inquest of 14 Henry VI., gives a distinct valuation of the Vill of Stile. It contained 34 messuages. The only Undertenants I can name here, were Adam de Sti chele, who attests a Sandford Deed about 1230, and William de Stywele, associated in 1253, with William de Blancminster in a raid on the estates of Combermere Abbey.

Later in the Century one Thomas de Slyele occurs in connection with Whixall. 35ettmt in Halts* Next to William Pantulfs, the largest interest in the Domesday Hundred of Odenet was that of Gerard de Tornai.

Gerardus de Tornaco (dedit) Beitonam, says the Earl himself in his Confirmation to the Abbey. The fact is repeated in the various Confirmations of William II. , Henry I., Stephen, Henry IL, and Henry III. ; but, more than that, it is recited in a Charter of Hamo Peverel and his wife Sibil, which passed about 1134, and of which the following is an abstract. \u2014 Notum sit, fye. quod Gyrardus de Tournay dedit villam appellatam Beitonam cum molendino, fye. libere et quiete ab omni servicio et ab omni calumpnid successorum suorum, coram Rogero Comite, Domino suo, qui hanc donacionem concessit et confirmavit.

It must not be supposed, from the above, that the gift of the vill of Betton implied the whole of the Domesday Manor. That it did not, I have good proof, without relying on Earl Hugh's spurious Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, which represents Hamo Peverel as standing in the Earl's presence and giving the tithes of his demesne of Buton subtus Lima. It is probable that Hamo Peverel had no such demesne to charge. What he had, was the Seigneury of Tun stal, a member of Betton, and this he conveyed to the Abbey about 40 years afterwards, that is, after the death of Henry I., and probably in 1136-7. I again give an abstract of his Charter. \u2014 Notum sit, fye. quod Hamo Peverel dedit Ecclesi\u00e6 Sancti Petri de Salopesbia villam qu\u00e6 vocatur Dunstal et servicium militis qui earn tenebat, ita ut ipse miles, Osmundus nomine, habeat earn in feudo, sibi et heredibus suis, et dabit Monachis quoeunque anno n solidos de recognicione adfestum Sti Michaelis ; et ipse Miles hoc libenter concessit.

The Empress's Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey confirms Hamo Peverel 's grant of Tunstall, apparently as one made since her Father's death.2 This confirmation passed about 1141. Between 1161 and 1182, Richard Peche, Bishop of Coventry, confirmed to the Abbey the tithes of Betton under Lime as tithes of its own de mesnes.3 Between 1175 and 1190, Ralph, Abbot of Shrewsbury, came to an agreement with Walter de Dunstanvill (as Lord of Ad derley) . It was that Walter and his heirs, without any power of revocation by the Abbey, should hold a certain parcel of the wood of Beiton, which he, by the Abbot's permission, had enclosed in his Park. The Abbot on the other hand was similarly to hold a parcel of the wood of Ethdredesh' (probably Adderley is meant) which stbod apart of itself, on one side of the road at Rugwardine (Rich wardine).

On May 13, 1256, King Henry III. being at Reading, granted the Abbot of Salop license to hold a weekly Market, on Thursdays, at his Manor of Betton subtus Lime, and a yearly Fair of 4 days, viz. the vigil, the day of, and the two days following, the feast of St. Matthew the Apostle (September 20-23) .6 King Henry III.'s Charter of Free Warren, passing at Windsor on May 21, 1256, allows the same Abbot that privilege in his demesnes of Betton sub tus Lime, &c.7 In September 1276, certain disputes were settled between the Abbot of Combermere, as Impropriator of the Rectory of Market Drayton, and the Abbot of Shrewsbury about tithes of newly culti vated land in Betton-subtus-Lime, which was within the Parish of ' &<<*\u25a0 Hundred.

It was agreed that the Abbot of Shrewsbury should re ceive all tithes of lands within the territory of Betton, Rugworthin (Richwardine), and Tunstall, as he was accustomed to do, and that he should pay to the Abbot of Combermere two merks yearly at the Church of Drayton.1 I do not find that this arrangement had any permanence, for (as we have seen), in 1291, the Abbot of Shrews bury, instead of paying anything to, received a pension of 30s. from, Drayton Church. It is at the same time clear that he never aban doned his tithes in the Parish. The Tenure-Roll of Bradford Hundred (about 1286) makes' Norton, Tunstall, Rigwardine, Lees (now \"The Lees\"), and half Little Drayton, to be members of the Abbot of Shrewsbury's Manor of Betton. This was with a view to conciseness rather than topo graphical accuracy, as we shall see in the sequel.

We next hear of this Ivo's son, Richard. He, much I imagine to the annoyance of his Suzerains, the Monks of Salop, alienated part of Tunstall to the rival Abbey of Combermere.

Richard de Tunstal, who, at the Assizes then held, failed to prosecute a suit of disseizin against Henry Abbot of Shrewsbury, was his Eldest son. The Sureties of the said Richard (II.) were Henry, son of Richard de Tunstal (that is, his own brother), and Reginald de Shavinton.4 Richard de Tunstal (I.) had also left a widow, Juliana, who at these same assizes was opposed in a suit of dower by Hugh de Wlonkeslaue (Longslow), as attorney for Philip, Vicar of Drayton, and for Philip le Clerk.5 Another suit of dower the same Juliana, widow of Richard de Duns tal, had preferred against the Abbot of Shrewsbury, but she did not prosecute it. Her Sureties were Ri chard and Henry, sons of Richard de Dunstal? The reason why her and her son's suits against the Abbot were not urged, was doubt less that the disputes had been arranged out of Court. As to the Abbot of Shrewsbury's composition w7ith Richard de Tunstall (IL), that appears in the two following Deeds which we may safely date about 1.256.\u2014 \"Richard de Tunestal, son of Richard de Tunestal, gives to Salop Abbey all his land of Tunestal and all his right in the said vill.

Witnesses, Thomas de Halecton, then Constable of Shrewsbury, William de Bascherch.* Perhaps a similar quitclaim, of all right in Rugwor thin, to the Abbey, by Thomas fitz Nicholas, was by the son of Alured de Norton's Feoffor. If so, it released the Abbey from an annual rent of 7s. 8d. and restored Richwardine to the Abbatial demesnes.5 One merk was paid by the Abbot for the surrender, and it was attested by Warm de Wililey, Stephen de Ocley and Ranulf de Warewic.6 We have seen William Cadugan of Richwardine and Hova, his brother, attesting a Deed about 1232. In Deeds of the next twenty years the former is called William de Rugwardine, and the latter is represented by a son, Hugh.

For this virgate the then Abbot of Shrewsbury sued Hugh, son of Hugh, alleging it to have been the seizin of a former Abbot (Hugh), in the reign of King John. On like ground the Abbot of 1256 sued William Cadygan (whom I take to have been a cousin rather than Great Uncle, of Hugh, Junior) for half a virgate in Rugworthin. Hugh, son of Hugh, alleged on his part that his father having died in his infancy, he, the son, had been in ward to the Abbot as a tenant by military service, and that the Abbot had accepted his homage for the said virgate. The Abbot however recovered the vir gate ; \u2014 on what ground, after looking at the Deed last above quoted, I cannot imagine. As to William Cadygan he got judgment of dismissal, sine die, on a technical point, viz. that Thomas, his bro ther, held the half-virgate for which he was sued.1 The Abbot had in fact sued the wrong man. Another action brought at these Assizes was by Hugh, son of Hugh de Rugwrthin against the Abbot for disseizing him of 2 acres in Rugwrthin. Here the Abbot proved that Hugh, the father, had only held the premises from year to year.2 OTooIertan, \" The same Gerard (de Tornai) holds Ulvreton.

Earl Hugh's spurious Charter says that Hamo Peverel in the Earl's own presence so granted the tithes of his demesnes of Wulrunton.4 And it is possible that in this instance the spurious Charter contains 3 Domesday, fo. 259. 4 S\u00bb'\u00b0P Chartulary, No. 5. 1 \u25a0s Salop Assizes, 40 Hen.

The less doubtful Charter of the Earl says nothing about these tithes, but Bishop Clinton saw a Charter of Earl Hugh, which as the Bishop's Confirmation says, conveyed the tithes of Wluruton, as tithes of the Earl's demesne.1 We must conclude that either the Earl granted these tithes while Gerard de Tornai's Fief was in his hands as an Escheat, or else that Hamo Peverel was the real Grantor and the Earl only a Confirmant. Somewhat similar difficulties have been mentioned in the cases of Shawbury and Cold Hatton.2 In Bishop Peche's time, as indeed in Bishop Clinton's, not only the tithes but the Manor of Wooler ton belonged to the Abbey. Bishop Peche's Charter accordingly recognizes the change and confirms the said tithes of Wlverton as tithes of the Abbot's demesnes. There is a further difficulty about the date of an undoubted fact, viz. that Hamo Peverel gave the vill of Woolerton to Shrewsbury Abbey. King Hemy I., in his Confirmation of 1121, sets forth at full how \" Hamo Peverel, successor of Gerard de Tornai, and who obtained the said Gerard's honour with his daughter, at the request of his said well-disposed wife, gave a vill named Wlvreton ; Richard, Bishop of London attesting the grant.\" This would fix the grant as between 1108 and 1121. If so, the actual Charter of Hamo Peverel, as preserved in the Salop Chartulary, must be taken as recordatory of the previous grant, for it belongs to a later period ; \u2014 about 1130-5. It runs, in brief, as follows. \u2014 Seiant, fye. quod Hamo Peverel et Sibilla uxor, assensu Regis Henrici, dedimus villam, qu\u00e6 dicitur Wluruntona, cum molendino, fye. sicut Gerardus de Tornay antecessor noster et nos postmodum earn melius et quietius tenuimus.

In the year 1242, the Abbot of Shrewsbury quitclaimed the above rent of 20d., on condition that the Abbot of Combermere would allow him to erect a stank for his mill of Wollerton on the other side of tbe River,1 that is, on the Abbot of Combermere's land of Chesthull. This agreement was tested by John le Strange, then Justice of Chester and Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire, and by Sir William de Ercalewe.2 In the previous year, that is, on April 10, 1241, it was thus agreed between \" Odo de Hodenet, Knight, son of Sir Baldwin, Knight,\" and the Abbot of Shrewsbury. Odo, for 4 merks, quitclaims all assarts made by himself or in his name, in the bosc of AVlfreton. The Abbot covenants to make no assarts for the future, in the bosc where Odo had a right of common, except with the consent of the said Odo or his heirs.

Between the years 1272 and 1278, Odo de Hodenet allows that Luke, Abbot of Salop, may lawfully make the most of those assarts in the Manor of Wluretone, a right of common wherein had been recovered by the said Odo, under Writ of novel disseizin, tried by John le Bretun and his Fellow-Justices at Alford.

Looking to the Scutage-Rolls, already given, we find Ightfield usually assessed at half a fee, and may further observe that though Ralph Hose was the person assessed in 1204, Roger de Ightfield be came responsible in 1214, and that his name is uniformly the one entered from thence till 1260.2 We shall presently see that this use of Roger de Ightfield's name, so late as 1260, was merely formal, and not accurate. \u2014 Among the Tornay Fees, recorded in the Feodary of 1240, Roger de Icheford stands as Tenant of half a knight's-fee in Icheford.3 Within the next 15 years Roger de Ightfield seems to have given Ightfield, in exchange, to Griffiu de Warren, who seems to have been son of William de Warren of Whitchurch. This is what the Hundred-Roll of 1255 alludes to, when it states that \" Griffin de Warran' holds the vill of Ihttefeud, having exchanged the said land with Roger de Ihttefeud, who held the same of the King in capite, by service of one Muntor, for 40 days, at bis own cost, at Shewur thyn, in time of war.\" The vill was still reputed to contain n hides, as at Domesday.

But Griffin did not appear, aud so an equivalent was ordered to be taken out of his lands and assigned to Thomas fitz Thomas.3 Griffin de Warren, alias de Blancminster, alias de Ightfield, was living in 1272, but was afterwards succeeded by his son John. The Feodaries of 1284-5 state that John, son of Griffin de Ithefeld, was then holding the vill of Ithefeld of the King in capite for half a knight's-fee.

Ralph Sprenghose had custody thereof together with the heir, for to him had Otho de Grandison transferred the said custody ; and Otho de Grandison had it from the King. At these same Assizes Isabella de Ithfeld (widow, I presume, of Griffin) was presented as holding 13 solidates of land in Ithfeld, and as being married to Warin de Grantvalour. The said Warin appeared and justified his position by exhibiting Letters Patent whereby the King, for a Fine of 100s., had allowed the said Isabella to marry at her own discre tion. I think that it must have been John de Ightfield who in Septem ber 1310 was returned under the name of John de Warenne as one of the Servientes prepared to be at Tweedmouth and to discharge the military service due from Fulk le Strange, \u2014 then Lord of Whitchurch.1 Consistently with this we find John de Garenne entered on the Nomina Villarum of 1316 as Lord of the Vill of Ythefeld.2 In 1356 Griffin, Lord of Ightfield, is found seeking to entail Ightfield on his Grandson Griffin, son of his son John. An Inquest held on July 5th in that year stated that it would not injure the King, if Griffin le Warenne were to enfeoff William de Botefeld, Clerk, and William de Ightefeld in the estate, provided that those Trustees should forthwith settle it on Griffin for life, with remainder to Griffin, son of John, son of Griffin, and on Elizabeth his wife, and the bodily heirs of Griffin, Junior, and Elizabeth, with ultimate remainder to the right heirs of Griffin le Warenne (Senior). The estate, said the Jurors, was held of the Crown by Grand Serjeantry, and was worth \u00a38 yearly, net value. It was Griffin le Warenne's only property.3 Of Undertenants in Ightfield, I may name Richard, son of William de Ichtefeud, who, in February 1271, was moving a suit of mort d'ancestre against Alice, widow of John le Clerk, Hugh Calle, and others, for a tenement in Ichtefeud. At the Assizes of 1272 Richard le Ostesveyn of Ittefeld failed to prosecute a suit of novel disseizin against John, Parson of Itte feld. At the same Assizes, William de Icthefeld sued James de Audley for a messuage and half-carucate in Icthefeld, alleging that Gilbert fitz Robert, his (the Plaintiff's) grandfather, had died seized thereof. Audley affirmed that his father, James, had died seized thereof, but the Suit was adjourned till the Defendant should 1 * > Parl. Writs, IV. 1588, 397. 3 Inquis. 30 Edw.

Qd. rent from Ightefeld ; but improperly treats the tenure as an appurtenance of Red Castle, when it was really nothing more than a sub-feoffment in Ightfield.1 Combermere Fee. From a Deed, printed in the Monasticon, we find that Roger, Lord of Ictefeld, having claimed a part of the Abbot of Combermere's wood of Wivelesde, which part was called Threpwode, as an appurtenance of Ightfield, was induced to renounce his claim for a sum of two merks. The boundaries of the wood of Wivelesde, as settled by this quitclaim, were to be, \u2014 from Oxefote mor to the top of Grenehul, thence to Spritlewithimle, and thence to Risewithbroc. The Deed is attested by Norman de Verdoun, Reinald de Wilvastone, Hugh de Draicote, Maltheus de Scavintone, and Osbert de Esshe (now Ash).2 By another Deed the same Roger de Ichtefeld gave in pure alms to the same Abbey a moiety of the Church of Ichtefeld and half a feorwendel (virgate) of his own demesne there, and half a feorwen del held by oue Auger. This grant was for the souls of himself, his wife, and all his relatives and friends. It was attested by Owen and Wilbam, Deacons; Adam and Peter, Clerks; Radulf fitz Anion ; Reinald de Wlavestone ; Matthew de Scavintone ; Aldred de Dottecote ; Osbert de Esshe ; and Roger de Elfstanefeld.3 Assuming the above Deeds to be nearly cotemporary, their date must remain uncertain. All I can say on this point is that the Grantor seems to have been that Roger de Ightfield who, between the years 1240 and 1255, and probably late in his life, gave Ight field to Griffin de Warren. His grants to Combermere seem to have been but partially effectual, for the Hundred-Roll of 1255 speaks of only one half- virgate in Ightfield as having been given by the said Roger de Ightfield to Combermere. Thomas fitz Robert now held it under the Abbot, doing no suit to County or Hundred. Henry III.'s Confirmation to the said Abbey bears date April 4, 1266, and speaks of Roger de Ythfeld's grant indefinitely, as \"all that land with the bosc called Trepwode and with all appurte nances.\"* At the Assizes of 1292 King Edward I. sued the Abbot of Combermere for 400 acres of bosc in Yghtefeld as the sometime seizin of King Henry II. The Abbot proved himself to have only 1 Inquisitions, 10 Edw. IL, No. 73. ' Monasticon, Vol. V. p. 326, No. X. 3 Monasticon (ibidem). No. IX. * Monasticon, V. 324, Num.

The mention of a Priest, resident here at Domesday, probably indicates the co-existence of a Church. There is no evidence of any other cotemporary Church in this district. Even the spacious Manor of Westune (afterwards called Whitchurch) was as yet Churchless. When Roger de Ightfield granted a moiety of the Advowson of Ightfield to Combermere Abbey we may question his title so to do, for the grant was inoperative. Neither are we told who claimed the other moiety. Later Records uniformly treat this Advowson as belonging to the Lords of Whitchurch. I can only account for this by supposing that Whitchurch had come to be re puted the Mother-Church of the district, and Ightfield a Depen dency. The Taxation of 1291, placing the Church of Ithefeld in the Deanery of Newport and Archdeaconry of Salop, values it at \u00a32. 13s. 4<d. per annum, besides a pension of 2s. which the Abbot of Combermere received therefrom.2 This Pension may have been in composition of the Abbot's claim to a share in the Advowson. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth taxel the Parish of Ightefeld at 46s. They said that the Church was taxed at its true value, and, as I understand their statement, that the difference between such true value and the present assessment consisted of glebe and such small tithes as were not to be reckoned in computing the Ninth? The Valor of 1534-5 places Ightfelde in the Deanery of Salop. The income of Robert Maynwaryng, Rector thereof, was \u00a38. per annum, out of which he paid 3s. 4d. for Procurations and 2s. for Synodals. A Chantry in this Church was further endowed with 100s. per annum? EARLY INCUMBENTS. John, Parson of Ightfield, has occurred above as living in 1272. At the Assizes of 1292 this John was questioned for having, eight years before, withdrawn the suit of his Tenants from the Sheriff's Tourn and annexed their land (one virgate) to the privileged domain {sanctuarium) of his Church. The Rector appeared and stated that the said land was always de sanctuario, that it had never been let, except to annual tenants-at-will, that he had now resumed it, 1 Quo Waranto, p. 683. 3 Inquis.

This was contradicted by a Jury, and the Rector was adjudged to pay 16d. damages to the Crown, or 2d. per annum, for the value of the suit withdrawn.1 This favours the idea that the Glebe of Ight field was no endowment of the original Church, but a later bene faction. Peter de Fomython or Futhun, Rector of Hythefeld, has a li cense of non-residence dated November 16, 1309, to enable him to manage successfully certain business affecting his benefice. He died November 19, 1313, and, on December 26 following,\u2014 Walter de Wrocwardvn, Priest, had been presented by Sir Fulk le Strange, Knight. Fulk Corbet, claiming to be Rector of Ightfield, resigned Nov. 22, 1323 ; and, on December 20 following, \u2014 Bartholomew de Berdefeld, Acolyte, was admitted at the presentation of Sir Fulk le Strange, Lord of White-Minster. Ber defeld resigned April 5, 1337; and, on April 16, \u2014 Roger le Spencer, Priest, was admitted, at the presentation of Sir John le Strange, Lord of Whitchirche. Spencer died August 30, 1349 (probably of the Pestilence) ; and, on the next day, \u2014 John Clone, Chaplain, was admitted at presentation of Dame Angaret le Strange, Lady of White-Minster. On June 13, 1363, this Rector exchanged preferments with \u2014 William de Blakelow, Chaplain, late Vicar of Aldelym (Aud lem), who was presented to Ightfield by the King, as Guardian of the infant heir of John le Strange of Blakmere. On July 20, 1376, Blakelow exchanged preferments with \u2014 John de Shevyndon, Priest, late Rector of Bidulf, the King presenting to Ightfield as before. On December 20, 1379, Shevyn don exchanged with \u2014 Stephen de Prees, Chaplain, late Rector of Donynton, the King again presenting to Ightfield.

The earliest Tenant, of whom I find mention after Domesday, was \u2014 Hugh de Muntein, living in the time of Henry II. (1154 1189). He mortgaged, and eventually lost the fee of, 30 acres of the Manor.

Possibly it was Richard ; for Richard de Wolncheslawe stands se cond witness of a Styche Deed about 1196-1200. This Emma seems to have been an heiress, and was possibly Representative of Hugh de Muntein. On May 3, 1200, a Fine was levied between Hugh de Wlenkeslawe and his Mother, Emma (Plaintiffs), and VVT alter fitz Robert (Tenant) of 4 virgates in Wlenkeslawe. The Tenant quitclaimed the premises, and in return received one virgate thereof (viz. that which his father, Robert, had held), to hold ofthe Plaintiffs and their heirs at a rent of a pair of spurs, value 2d., and by discharge of all forinsec services. Moreover the Plaintiffs gave him 10 merks. In October 1200, I find Hugh de Wlenkelaw im pleading Walter fitz Robert for non-observance of the above Fine.

At the Assizes of 1221, Hugh de Wlonkeslawe was found never to have been seized of cer tain common-pasture which he claimed as an appurtenance of Wlonkeslawe, and of which he accused the Prior of Ware, Hugh le Nonnan, Alexander le Deble, and Adam de Hales, of having dis seized him. Hugh de Say was Surety for Hugh de Wlonkeslawe in this matter. Adam Osmund, Adam Silkenside, and his sons, Gilbert and Robert, are mentioned as Sureties of the Defendants.3 The common-pasture claimed, was probably in Market Drayton. From what has been said elsewhere it would seem that Hugh de Longslow, living in 1228, and then married to Alice, a daughter or other relation of Hugh fitz Robert of Bolas, was identical with Hugh de Longslow, living in 1256.* I will call this person \u2014 Hugh de Longslow (III.), though I think that the word atavus, above referred to, suggests a greater number of generations in this descent than is consistent with average probability. A Tenure- Roll of 1240 has Hugh de Wlonkeslawe as holding half a knight's-fee in the Fief of Tornay.6 The Bradford Hundred- Roll of 1255 puts down Wlonkislow as a vill of three geldable hides, thus preserving the Domesday estimate. \u2014 \" Hugh de Wlon kislow, Lord of the Vill, held it in capite, by service of 40 days in time of war, at the Castle of Shraw-ardine, or of Shrewsbury, at his own cost.

In Hilary Term 1259 Hugh de Wlongeslawe was suing John de Verdon for permission to take estovers in the Bosc of Morton (Moreton Say). I assume that Hugh de Langes lawe, who in 1267 was amerced 2 merks for trespass, was son and heir of the above. Calling him \u2014 Hugh de Longslow (IV.), I find that in 1270 he had a Writ against William, son of John Hertte, for disseizing him of common pasture in Wlonkeslowe. At the Assizes of 1272 the name of Hugh de Wlonkeslowe as a Juror for Bradford Hundred is cancelled on the Roll. At these Assizes he recovered 20 acres in Wlonkeslowe, of which the Abbot of Combermere had disseized him. His cotem porary success in a Cantlop suit I have related elsewhere.1 I find him employed on various Inquests in 1276, 1277, 1281, and 1284. The Feodaries of 1284-5 both specify his tenure-in-capite of Wlen keshale or Longislow, by service of half a knight's-fee, which service, being now, I suppose, returnable at Montgomery Castle, Longislow is called, in one Feodary, a member of the Manor of Montgomery. At his death, in January 1290, Wlonkeslowe was valued at\u00a36. 2s Ad. per annum. It comprised a messuage, two carucates of demesne land, and an inefficient Mill {molendinum debile) worth 6s. 8d. yearly. It was held by the deceased in capite for half a knight's fee, his service being to supply one horseman, with hauberk and chapel-de-fer, at Montgomery Castle, in time of war. Hugh de Longslow (V.) was questioned, at the Assizes of 1292, for having withdrawn 2s. 8c?., such sum having been payable by the Vill of Wlonkeslowe, till 30 years since, for stretward and motfee. His defence, viz. that the King was still seized of the same due, was corroborated by the Sheriff. He was further questioned as to his discharge of the services due on his Serjeantry : to which he replied that nothing was in arrear, as he had only been three years in possession. His homage to the King had been rendered. Another Presentment, by the Bradford Jurors, recalled the original tenure-in-capite of Hugh de Mounteny, and valued Wlonkeslowe at 100s. per annum. The Jurors proceeded to allege several aliena tions in this Serjeantry, viz. 23 acres held by William de Hodynet, 5 acres by Richard de la Forde, 2 acres by Thomas Rabaz, and a Mill by the Abbot of Combermere. These four parties were sum moned. William de Hodynet vainly protested that all his land, 1 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 289."], [255, "217 LONGSLOW. thus brought in question, was in Longford, a member of Hodnet. A Jury found the said 23 acres to be in Longslow and the King recovered them, but William de Hodynet negotiated a Fine whereby he was henceforth to hold the premises in capite, at 10s. rent. It was further shown, in respect of Richard de Forde and Thomas Rabaz, that they were tenants in villeinage under William de Hod ynet. As to the Abbot, he fined for leave to retain his Mill ad proximum parliamentum. I find Hugh de Longslow on a local Jury in 1292, and as a Juror on the Forest perambulation of 1300. The King's Writ of Diem clausit announces his death on March 8, 1314, when he must have been at least 64 years of age. An In quest held at Drayton on April 2nd following, stated the tenure in capite of Longslow in the usual terms, but only valued the estate at \u00a32. 2s. 2\\d. per annum. The Coheirs of the deceased were his daughters, Isabel, aged 14 years on Dec. 25, 1313, and Eleanora, aged 10 years on November 1, 1313. Both these Infants were already married, \u2014 Isabel to Thomas, son of William de Stuch (Styche), and Eleanore to Hugh, son of William de la Hull.1 From these two Coheiresses the ennobled families of Clive and Hill are on good authority said to be descended. I refer elsewhere for some details of a later date than my limits will allow.2 In the Nomina Villarum of March 1316, William de Stuche is alone entered as Lord of Wlonkeslowe. Here I conceive that not only the name of one Coparcener is suppressed, but that the other is erroneously given, that is, the Father's name substituted for the Son's. The only Undertenants in Longslow whose names I need add to the above account, are Peter de la Ford and Hugh his son, witnesses of a^Styche Deed about 1230 ; William de Longslow, Juror on a Wem Inquest in 1284; and Hugh de Furde, Juror on a Longslow Inquest in 1314. 1 Inquisitions, 7 Edw.

In King Edward's time, tbe two Manors were worth 38s. yearly. Now they are worth 20s. He (Gerard de Tornai) found them waste.\"1 The reason why Domesday associates the two Manors of Ellardine and Hatton is because they were contiguous, and both held in de mesne by Gerard de Tornai, and because their hidage, being frac tional when taken separately, amounted exactly to 2 hides when taken together. In other words Hatton was two-thirds of a hide and Ellardine was 1-j- hides. In all later aspects the histories of Cold Hatton and Ellardine will be found very distinct. I have discussed under Ercall Church the probability that Earl Hugh gave two parts of the tithes of Ercall and Cold Hatton to Shrewsbury Abbey before Hamo Peverel was seized of either estate.2 Bishop Clinton's Charter making mention of the said grant3 calls Cold Hatton by another name, viz. the land of Wiscard. This in troduces us to the first known Feoffee of Cold Hatton, viz. that Wiscard whose descendants held both Hatton and Wilsithland under the superior Lords of each estate. It is worth observing that in 1165 the Kentish Fief of Walche line Maminot included two feoffments which, I think, must have been held by members of this family of Wiscard. Alan Wise held one fee, and Baldwin Wise was a Coparcener in two fees of the said Barony.* Probably Baldwin Wise was a relation of, but not identical with, \u2014 Baldwin, son of Gilbert Wiscard, who was certainly Lord of Cold Hatton in succession to the said Gilbert. We know this from a Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey which passed between 1182 and 1 Domesday, fo. 258. b, 2. 5 Supra, page IOS. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 325. 1 Liber Niger, I. pp. 57, 58."], [257, "219 COLD HATTON. 1197, whereby Baldwin Wischard concedes to the Abbey that land of Podelcford which Gilbert his Father gave thereto.1 Now Polford was a member of Cold Hatton. It is true that William de Hedley (II.) is also said to have given the land of Podeford to Wombridge Priory,2 but this does not invalidate the genuineness of Baldwin Wischard's Deed, whatever doubt it may create as to his title to Polford. The period when Baldwin Wischard succeeded his father, Gilbert, can be nearly ascertained.\u2014 The Pipe- Roll of 1182, records Baldwin Wischart as accounting 20s. to the King for his Relief of a fifth part of a Knight's-fee. It will presently appear that this must refer to his tenure in capite of Cold Hatton as a Tornai Escheat. A Feodary, drawn up about the year 1212, registers Baldwin Wischart as holding Hatton in capite, by ancient tenure. He is here said to owe the service of one-fourth of a knight's-fee.3 The Scutage- Rolls, already given,* correct this, and show that Baldwin Wischard's service was one-fifth of a fee. His first contribution of this kind was in 1203, his last in 1235-6 (to the Aid on marriage of the King's Sister), when he paid 5s. 3d. or nearly one-fifth of 2 merks. Subsequent Scutages, though nominally charged on Bald win Wischard, were really paid by \u2014 William Wischard, his son and heir. A Feodary of about 1240, enters William Wyschard as holding one-fifth of a fee in Hatton, of the fees of William de Cantilupe? I take this to be a mere mistake as to tenure, for I cannot find that Cold Hatton was one of those Tornai Fees which owed ward to Montgomery Castle, otherwise the error might have been accounted for. William Wis chard's name appears on Jury- Lists or Testing-clauses of the years 1246, 1249, 1256, and 1259. In 1246 we have had mention of his brother, Robert.6 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 notices Colde-hatton as a geldable Manor of half a hide (something less than its Domesday hidage), and as being held for one-fifth of a fee. William (Wis chard), Lord of the Vill, held it in capite of the King, and did 20 days' ward in time of war at the Castle of Slobir' (read Salopesbury) at his own cost, with horse, hauberk, lance, and chapel defer.

Between the years 1260 and 1265, William Wischard gave Cold Hatton to Lilleshall Abbey, and the grant was specified and sanc tioned in Henry III.'s Confirmation to Lilleshall, dated Nov. 29, 1265, as \" the donation and concession which William Wyschard had made of the vill of Goldehaton.\" . In the respective grants of Polford by a Hadley and a Wischard to two different Monasteries, we have had a hint that the Lords of High Ercall asserted some claim on Cold Hatton. This idea is backed by a quitclaim which must have passed about the year 1270. Thereby John de Erkalewe releases to Lilleshull Abbey his claim in the vill of Colde-Hatton, saving only to himself and his heirs the suit which the Abbot's Tenants in Coldehatton owed to the Quit claimant's Mill of La Lake. Witnesses, Sirs Odo de Hodnet, John fitz Hugh, and John fitz Aer, Knights ; Robert Corbet of Morton, Peter de Eyton, Robert de Stanton, and Philip de Peninton.2 The following Fine, levied in Easter Term 1283, is, I presume, of a subtenure in Cold Hatton. Richard de Preston and Isolda, his wife (Impedients), acknowledge their grant of a messuage and half virgate in Hacton to Robert, son of Henry Chardemere of Rowel ton (Plaintiff), who pays 10 merks for the grant, and is to hold the premises under the Grantors and the heirs of Isolda, at a rose-rent. A Tenure-Roll, about 1285, states that \" the Abbot of Lilleshull holds the vill of Cold Hatton of the gift of William Wechard, in pure alms, and by confirmation of King Henry III.\" At the As sizes of 1292 the Bradford Jurors presented the Abbot for exer cising rights of warren in Hattone and Langedone. The process of Quo Waranto, which included this and other questions, has been already set forth,3 as also the Charter which justified the usage of Free Warren in Cold Hatton.* Another question raised at these Assizes admitted that William Wyschard's grant of Cold Hatton to Lilleshull had received Royal sanction, but Hugh de Lowther (the Crown Prosecutor) insisted that the services due from the Vill had never been cancelled.

The King recovered both the services and the arrears thereof, viz. 10s. for arrears of stretward,*1 and at the rate of 2s. per annum for suit. The last expression is explained by a list of Crown-dues acknowledged in the Chartulary of Lilleshall Abbey.2 It there ap pears that the Abbot was bound to pay the King 2s. per annum at Michaelmas, in beu of the ward due to Shrewsbury Castle, and the suit due to Bradford Hundred, from the Vill of Colde Hatton. The Vill itself is further entered as liable for 4d. per annum, \u2014 the stret ward and motfegh due at the same term. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Abbot of Lylleshull \u00a31. 7s. of assized rents at Coldehatton.3 In 30 Edward I. (1301-2), Richard de Mora, a Tenant of the Abbey at Cold Hatton, died. His heir remained in ward to the Abbot for one fortnight. Then Ayota, wife of Roger de Hatton, purchased the wardship for 5s. and mar ried the ward to her daughter Agnes.* In the Valor of 1534-5 the Abbot of Lilleshull's receipts from Cold Hatton, Longdon, and Tern, are massed together; but the Ministers' Accounts, six years later, give a Free Rent, of 5s. 4c?. only, as arising from Coldhalton? i^attfifortu This was another of those Manors which Gerard de Tornai held wholly in demesne at Domesday. \u2014 \" The same Gerard holds Sanford (of the Earl).

The Seigneury of Sandford must be taken to have passed in the usual course, viz. from Gerard de Tornai to his daughter Sibil and her husband Hamo Peverel, and subsequently to have escheated to the Crown by failure of all lineal descendants of Gerard de Tornai. Like other Tornai Escheats, Sandford became a Tenure-in-capite de eschaetd, a thing which was distinguished from a Tenure-in-capite de Corond in this way. \u2014 The King, as Suzerain of Sandford, merely represented Gerard de Tornai, and was not entitled to custody or wardship of such lands as his Tenant at Sandford may have held under other Suzerains. The history of Sandford Manor is however more interesting in respect of its Feoffees than in respect of any abstract question of feudal usage. It is one of those very few Shrop shire estates which can be said to be held by the lineal descendant, in the male line, of its earliest known Feoffee. Whether the Sand fords of Sandford were first enfeoffed by Gerard de Tornai, by Hamo Peverel, or by Henry II. , is matter of conjecture. I incline to date their feoffment from the \u00e6ra of Henry I., and if so must attribute it to Hamo Peverel. I think too that the Arms born by the Sand fords indicate an alliance with, or a descent from, that great House of Fitz Warin, which first came into notice during the reign of Henry I. Whether the Sandfords succeeded to Ruthall (another Tornai Escheat) as heirs of Gerelmus, its Domesday Tenant, is a question already stated to be incapable of solution.1 We may safely declare the Sandfords to have been Tenants-in-capite of both Manors, as early as the reign of Henry II. I now proceed to give such particulars of this family as have not already transpired under Ruthall, or under Sutton Maddock. \u2014 Richard de Sanford, the first known representative of his line, occurs in 1167, when he was amerced half a merk by Alan de Ne vill, a Justice of the Forest. He renders account ofthe debt on the Pipe-Roll of 1169. Thomas de Sandford, the next in this succession, was living in 8 Richard I. (1196-7), and was, with his wife Amabil, daughter and coheir of Richard Cardiff, party to a fine then levied with Thomas de Bavis and Hadwiss his wife, the other coheir of Richard Cardiff. Sandford and his wife, as Tenants, concede to the other party, as Plaintiffs, a moiety of the following estates, viz. three-fourths of a knight's-fee in Toppesfeld, one-fourth of a knight's-fee in Granten don, one knight's-fee in Hameledeun, one-fourth of a knight's-fee 1 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 48."], [261, "223 SANDFORD. in the New vill of Glamorgan, one knight's-fee in Glamorgan-de-St. Hilary, and 3 hides and 1 virgate of land in Haiston, all which had been held by Richard Cardifi', father of Amabil and Hadwiss.1 I cannot trace any share in the above estates to any later member of the family of Sandford, but the subject is one on which extant evi dence is hardly to be expected. It would seem that this Thomas de Sandford was a Knight, and that he lodged a complaint with the Court of Rome as to the spolia tion of Sandford Chapel by the Co-Rectors of Prees, who had strip ped it of certain land and rents, wherewith it had been endowed by the Complainant's Ancestors. It is both perplexing and remarkable that in a Rescript of Pope Innocent III., dated at St. Peter's on March 3, in the 17th year of the said Pope's Pontificate {i. e. March 3, 1214), this complaint is treated as a recent one, while it is certain that Thomas de Sandford had been dead at least 10 years. \u2014 The Papal Letter is only half preserved, but enough remains to show that all Abbots of the Cistercian Order, within the Diocese of Coventry, and the Prior of Ranton are appointed Judges- delegate to remedy any injustice which may have been done to the \" Knight, Thomas,\" the complainant.3 The well known delays, which attended suits in the Court of Rome, and the possible loss of some previous documents, may perhaps account for the anachronism which sepa rates this Papal Rescript from the \u00e6ra of him who sought it. Ralph de Sandford, the successor, and either the son or brother, of Thomas, occurs almost continuously from 1203 to 1231. Of this we have had much evidence under Sutton Maddock and Ruthall, to which I have something now to add. In Michaelmas Term 1207, Thomas Basset was impleading Ralph de Sanford for damages done by the Defendant's Cattle in breaking into the Plaintiff's Park. Sanford not appearing, his Securities for appearance in Hilary Term following, were ordered to be increased. I find nothing more of this suit and cannot indicate the precise locality in which Basset and 1 Dugdale's Visitation of Shropshire, 1663^ (In Collegio Armorum), fo. 105. fort quibusdam redditibus, terris, et aliis rebus, quas ancessores ipsius militis eidem concessere Capell\u00e6 ad usum proborum de servientium in eddem, contra justiciam spoliarunt.

About 1212, we have a list of Tenants who \"held in capite of the Escheats of Gerard de Thurnay.\" Ralph de Sandford thus held San ford by service of half a knight's-fee.1 A letter written by tbe Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire to King John contains internal evidence of its date, viz. the \" Close of Easter \" 1215. It is an able digest of the pobtical state of the two Counties at that period of commotion.2 It certifies, among other things, that Ralph de Sinfort was one of those Salopians who had been, and still continued, opposed to the Crown in the existing war. The effect of this intelligence on the vengeful King does not appear till March 8, 1216, when the Sheriff of Shrop shire is ordered by a Writ- Close to give all the land in his Baili wick which had been Ralph de Samford's to David de Malpas.3 In November 1217, another Writ of King Henry III. certifies the Sheriff of Shropshire that Ralph de Samford had returned to his allegiance, and orders a reversal of the disseizin, which he had suffered on his rebellion against King John.* The following Fine, levied at Westminster on October 19, 1224, probably relates to a disputed marriage-portion, the portion, I think, of a sister of Ralph de Sanford. Henry de Dorlaveston (now Darliston), and Agnes his wife, tenants of 3 bovates in Samford, whereof was Suit at law,5 quitclaim the same to Ralph de Samford, Plaintiff. In return Ralph concedes the premises, to Henry and Agnes, and the heirs of Agnes' body, to hold under himself, at a rent of 2d., payable annually at Christmas. If Agnes should die without issue, then, on the further decease of her husband, the premises were to revert to Samford, who now paid 3 merks to Henry and Agnes. The said Henry and Agnes further renounced all claim to two virgates in Dorlaveston which had been in dispute between Samford and themselves. I have already given a synopsis of the Scutages to which Ralph de Sandford was assessed, from 1204 to 1232.6 The subsequent use of his name in Scutage-Rolls is no proof that 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 56.

In short, we know that he was deceased at Michael mas 1235. All that I have further to say on this subject is that the Pipe- Roll of 1229 enters him as still owing half a merk for the Scutage of Montgomery, which had been put in charge five years previously. Ralph de Sandford (I.) purchased Styche from Robert, son of Robert Belle. Of that matter I shall speak elsewhere. The follow ing Deed is more apposite to our present subject. \u2014 Between 1224 and 1234, \" Radulf, Lord of Sanford,\" gives to William, son of Richard de Lake, for his homage and service and for half a merk, paid on entry, an assart in Bromlege, containing 29 seylions, near Berndehurste ; \u2014 also an assart called Evichesleg (Aychley), reaching from the old king's-highway to Stockenebrigge, and extending beyond Stockenebrigg to Hurst, on that side which was nearest Bromlege, and so on, close by the margin {costeram) of Hurst, to the Moor between Berdehurste and Evichesleg, and so going down from the said Hurst through the moor, according to the hounds made between the parties, and* past a certain meadow, held by R. fitz Eda of the Grantor, and past a certain other meadow, from Ermittelegesford up to the boundary of Loskesford (Losford) ; \u2014 the whole to be held by the Grantee under the Grantor and his heirs, in fee, &c., with all easements pertaining to the Grantor's vill of Sanford. The Grantee is to pay an annual rent of 2s. and one hog, when any swine of his, above seven in number, shall have been fattened on the Grantor's pesson. Witnesses, William de Stanton, Hugh de Evechestan (probably Hawkstone), John de Leeton, Edwin de Wilaston, William de Cnlleshasel, Alan de Nakinton, Adam de Stichele (Steel), Yvo de Suletone, and many others.1 Before I quit this notice of Ralph de Sandford (I.) I should set forth a certain Document in which the initial letter of his name occurs. It is an abstract of a Rescript by Pope Honorius III. aud is of date September 18, 1218.2 \u2014 \"Honorius Episcopus, fye. dilectis filiis de Bildewas, de Hagemon (et) de Wanbruge Prioribus3 Coventr.

Lateran'. 14 kal Oct., Pontificates anno 3ia . \u2014 The significances of this Document are, I presume, that the previous appeal by Thomas de Sandford to Pope Innocent III. had resulted in assigning both the duties and the emoluments of Sandford Chapelry to the Co-Rectors of Prees ; \u2014 that they had ac cepted the benefice without any regard to its obligations ; \u2014 and that a second appeal, by the Representative of Thomas de Sandford to the Representative of St. Peter, was now put in course of arbitration. It is difficult, at this distance of time, to decide whether the ascend ency acquired in England by Pope Innocent III., or the venality and sloth of the superior Clergy, did most to undermine that rami fied parochial system, which owed its most liberal support, if not its prime organization, to the terror and remorse which prevailed in King Stephen's time. \u2014 If it be true that great evil may and does sometimes result in great good, it is hardly to be expected that the good, thus engendered, will be permanent. Richard de Sandford (II. ), son and heir of Ralph, succeeded him between the years 1231 and 1335. At Michaelmas in the latter year, and at Easter 1236, Richard de Sonford is enrolled as paying, in two instalments, the sum of one merk (the proportion due on half a Tornai Fee) to the Aid on marriage of the King's Sister.1 In July 1241, I find Richard de Sanford named as a Justiciar to try a local cause. He died, as I have said under Sutton, in or about the year 1249, leaving a son and heir, Ralph, then 14 years of age, and a widow, Eleanor, who remarried to Richard Burnell. The In quest on his death makes Sanford and Ruthall to have been held in capite, collectively for half a knight's-fee. Richard de Sanford had also held 7s. 4id. assized rent in Derlawston {i. e. Darliston) , of the Bishop of Coventry. His whole estate (including \u00a34. 4s. 8d. from Brockton and Caughley2) was computed at \u00a313. 3s. 7d. per annum, an income which in those days was far above the average of knightly estates. Having now determined the \u00e6ra of Sir Richard de Sand ford, I proceed to notice a variety of documents, dated and undated, in which his name occurs. \u2014 The abstracted Deed which I first give, passed between 1232 and 1242, and is a grant by a Tenant of Sir Richard de Sandford to that Tenant's Nephew. \u2014 Adam Venator, filius Wulrici de Wichishalle, in legid potestate dedi Willielmo filio Alicie sororis mee, pro homagio et pro sex mar cis et dimid', unam dimidium virgatam in villa de Sanford.

Wilaviston, Ricardo filio Roberti Sanfort, Johanne de Darlaviston? A Fine, levied at Shrewsbury on November 18, 1240, shows the above Adam Venator under the name of Adam le Veiner. He, as Tenant of 1^ virgates in Sauns ord, and William fitz William, as Tenant of half a virgate and 8 acres in the same vill, had been im pleaded by Adam fitz Richard (whom I know to have been Adam Venator's nephew), for the said tenements. Both Defendants had called Richard de Saunford to warranty. The latter now ap peared, as vouching the required warranty, and so becoming a party to the Fine. The said Fine was that Adam fitz Richard quitclaimed all his right in the premises to Richard de Saunford and his heirs, and also conceded to the said Richard de Saunford 3 nokes, viz. the whole land which the Quit-claimant held in the vill of Saunford, \u2014 to hold to Richard de Saunford and his heirs, under the Lords of the Fee. In return Richard de Saunford gave to the Quit-claimant one-fourth part of the Manor of Whitekeshal, to hold to the said Quit-claimant and his heirs, under the Lords of the Fee. A Suit, tried at Westminster in October 1242, shows that the above Adam Venator was then dead, and that his widow, under the name of \" Edith, widow of Adam le Hunter,\" was seeking dower in her husband's former estate at Sandford. She so sued Richard de Sanford for thirds of 2 bovates of land in Sandford, and she sued William de Sanford for a moiety of 12 denariates of rent there. The parties accorded, Richard de Sanford buying off the claim against him for 2 merks, and William de Sanford allowing a third of the 12 denariates of rent held by him.2 A Deed, which must needs be dated between 1242 and 1249, shows Adam fitz Richard (the nephew of Adam Venator) re-exchanging his estate at Whixall for a tenement in Sandford.3 \u2014 Adam filius 1 Dugdale's Visitation (ut supra), so. 107. The Seal of this Deed is allusive to the Grantor's profession. In the back ground is a tree, or fleury device : in the foreground a Greyhound courant. The Legend (Sigilltxm Ade Venatobis) is very distinct. \u2014 The Deed, I suppose, suggested the He raldic statement that \" Ralph de Sandford married Alice, daughter of Wolfric of Quixhull, and sister of Adam Venator.\" The Heralds have however altogether err ed in making Alice's husband to be that Ralph de Sandsoj d who died in 1308. \u2014 I think it a question whether Alice's husband was not William, a younger brother of Ralph de Sanford (I.), by whom she had a son, a second William, the Grantee in the above Deed. If Wil liam, sou of Alice, had been brother or half-brother to Richard de Sanford (IL), the latter would surely have so described him, and not called him \" William son of Alice de Sanford,\" as he does in a subse quent Deed. 2 Placita, Mich.Tm. 26 Hen.

If so, a probability arises that the Lacons as sumed the Sandford Arms with reference to this match. \u2014 Ricardus filius Ricardi de Laka, proprid potestate existens, dedi Ricardo filio Roberti de Sonfort pro homagio et servicio suo et pro xx solidis, duas virgatas terre in villa de Sonfort, scilicet Mas quas Dominus Ricardus de Sonfort* dedil cum Giliand matre mea Ricardo de Lake patri meo in libero maritagio, fye. ; \u2014 tenend' et habend' de 1 Now or afterwards of Ightfield (su pra, p. 209). 2 DugdaWs Visitation, so. 106-b : \u2014 collated with Harl.

Ralph de Sandford (II.), son and heir of Richard, has already been spoken of as a Minor in September 1249 and January 1256, and as in ward to Odo de Hodnet.3 A Patent of 1251 shows Richard Burnell and Alianore his wife (she was Richard de Sand ford's widow) impleading Odo de Hodenet for having disseized them of common pasture in Samford. By an entry on the Plea-RoU of November 1253, it appears that Odo de Hodnet, having been sued for seizing the Cattle of Richard Burnel, had repeatedly failed to appear. Wilbam de Devenays was Burner's Attorney in the Suit, now again adjourned. The Hundred- Roll of 1255 uses a strange but quite intelligible expression when it says that \" Odo de Hodnet, as Guardian, holds Ralph de Santford of the King in capite, by service of one Muntor at Shewarthyn (Shrawardine), for forty days in time of war, at his own cost. The Vill was in hides (its Domesday measure) and paid \\2d. yearly for stretward and \\2d. for motfee. It did due suit to County and Hundred, and was geldable. Alienura, Lady of San ford, had been in the King's custody and was now married to Richard Burnell, the Jurors knew not by what authority. The land of the said Lady was worth 100s. per annum. The King had given the (above) wardship to Germanus Cissor, and Odo de Hodnet had obtained it from the said Germanus.\"4 The Pipe-Roll of this same year (1255) shows that \" Richard Burnel was amerced 10 merks, because of his marriage with Alienora de Saunford being son of Robert de Sanford, as Grantee of lands in Sanford from Ralph de Sanford. The Deed was sealed with the effigy of a knight on horseback. I conclude that the Grantor was Ralph de Sandford (I.), who, we know, used such a Seal (supra, Vol. II. p. 126, note 75). 1 \u2022 2 Charters at Sandford. 3 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 127, 128. 4 Rot.

Notwithstanding the continued minority of Ralph de Sanford in January 1256, it was found at the Assizes, then held, that Richard de Wardhull and five others had disseized him of hab\" an acre in Saunford. At the Assizes of 1272 Ralph de Sondeford was Foreman of the Jurors of Bradford Hundred. The Feodary of 1284 merely states that \" Ralph de Sanford holds Sanford in capite for half a knight's-fee.\" That of 1285-6 says that \" Ralph Sondford holds the viU of Sondford, and also the vib of RowthaU, in the Hundred of Monslow, of the King, in capite sine medio, by service of finding one horseman at Montgomery in war-time, for 40 days, at his own cost.\" A Jury-List of February 1290 exhibits Sir Ralph de Sanford as a knight. At the Assizes of October 1292 he was one of the Elizors for Bradford Hundred. Among the Placita Coron\u00e6, his tenure of Saundford is properly classed as a Serjeantry, and the integrity of the Serjeantry was asserted, but I question with what accuracy, if by integrity it was meant that nothing in Sandford had been ahen ated by feoffment. The Manor was calculated to be worth \u00a310 per annum. As to the service due on his Serjeantry, Ralph de Sanford declared that he had discharged it in the late wars; and he cited the Records of Bogo de Knovill, Custos of Montgomery Castle, in proof of his assertion. He was dismissed sine die. I must here set forth another document in proof that Ralph de Saudford's services had been duly discharged. The campaign tech nically known as \" the war of Lewellyn and David\" ended in the death of Lewellyn on Dec. 11, 1282. Ralph de Sandford was then about 47 years of age, and it would seem that he compounded by a pecuniary Fine for his personal services. \u2014 It is probable that the date expressed in the following receipt is inaccurate, for it is unlikely that such a composition should have remained due for a space of 24 years. \u2014 Universis fye.

King Edward II.'s Writ of Diem clausit on the death of Ralph de Sanford bears date on January 4, 1308. An Inquest followed on January 14th at Sandford. It found that the deceased had held the hamlet of Sandford in capite, by service of one armed man, with a horse, not barbed, at Montgomery, for 40 days in war-time. Two shillings per annum were due on Sandford to the King's Bai liffs, for stretward (and motfee,l presume). The Vill owed monthly suit to the County, and suit every three weeks to the Hundred of Bradford. The deceased had held 10s. rent in Derlaston and Mit teneley (Mickley) under the Bishop of Chester, for which he was bound to do suit at the Manorial Court of Prees. Richard, son and heir of the deceased, was said to be 30 years of age.1 It is pro bable that he was somewhat older. The public \u00e6ra of Ralph de Sandford (II.) being now ascertained, as from 1256 to 1307, when he was 72 years of age, the following documents refer to the private affairs of himself and his family. \u2014 Between the years 1256 and 1272, Richard deEsche and his wife Agnes release and quitclaim to Ralph de Sanford, their Lord, 3 bovates in the viU of Sanford, which were the right and inheritance of Agnes, and which she and her husband held under Ralph de San ford by a rent of 2c?. It is further stipulated that Ralph and his heirs should pay the said rent of 2d. to his Mother, Dame Elyanore, for her life, and in the name of dower.

The Deed was attested by Sir Hodo de Hodenet, Sir Robert Corbet, Wibiam de Titneley, Ivo de Suleton and John de Hauckestan ;3 but, as we shall see, the pur chase was afterwards completed for other considerations.

Before I proceed with any account of Richard de Sandford, eldest son and heir of Ralph de Sandford (II. ), I will say something of the younger sons of the said Ralph.

In May 1253, Madoc de Elwardyn is entered as taking out a Writ of novel disseizin against Madoc, son of Griffin Goch and others, for a tene ment in Ellewardyn.1 In October 1253, Madoc de Sutton is in turn a Plaintiff against William de Ercalew and Madoc de El wardyn, for disseizing him of a tenement in Ruwelton and Elwar dyn.1 The Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" Madoc de Sutton holds the Manor of Rowelton, by Serjeantry of conducting the King in Wales, in time of war. The Manor was accounted to be in hides, and paid 12d. motfee and 12d. stretward, and did due suit to County and Hundred.\"2 By Roivelton we must here understand Rowton and Ellardine, though the three hides given, fall short of the Domes day complement by one-third of a hide. At the Assizes of January 1256, John de Erkalewe appeared as Bailiff of his father William, then sick, and vainly defended an ac tion, brought against the said William de Erkalewe, by William le Franceys and John de Rewelton, for having injuriously set up a stank in Rewelton and Osberdiston (Osbaston), and thereby injuring the Plaintiffs' tenements. Between 1262 and 1265 (for that must be the date ofthe trans action), Madoc de Sutton alienated Sutton, Rowton, and Ellardine to John le Strange (III.), of Nesse and Cheswardine.3 \u2014 This fact I learn from the presentment De Serjanciis of the Bradford Jurors in 1292. They said that Madoc de Sutton's in terest in \" Sutton and its members, viz. Rowelton and Elworthyn, was worth 50s. per annum ; and that he had held them by Ser jeantry of providing 4 foot soldiers in ward of Montgomery Castle, for 15 days, at his own cost.4 So then the Serjeantry had been altogether changed from the original one of serving the King, as Latimer, in his Welsh wars. But to continue; \u2014 it must have been between 1262 and 1267 that John le Strange (III.)\" enfeoffed John, his eldest son and heir, in Rowelton and Elleworthyn, re serving a rent of one penny only thereon.4 Again within the same interval the said John (the younger) gave the said tenements to his brother, Robert.4 This transfer partly explains a Patent of Sep tember 1267, whereby Egidius de Erdinton is empowered to try a 1 The Pipe-Roll of 1254 gives Madoc de Ellewardin as paying half a merk, and Madoc de Sutton as owing one merk, for these respective Writs. 2 Rot.

This exchange must have been between September 1267 and March 1269, when Giles de Erdinton was dead.2 However there must have been some doubt about the validity of the exchange ; \u2014 for in November 1 269, Henry de Erdinton (he was son and heir of Giles) was suing Robert le Strange under Writ of mort d'ancestre for a messuage and carucate in Rouleton and Eleworthin. Again in July 1270, John de Erkalewe sues Henry de Erdinton for disseizing him of common-pasture in Ruylton, and Robert le Strange sues John de Erkalewe for a like act of disseizin (in Rowelton). We are sure by inferential evidence that the interest of Henry de Erdinton, was at length established in Rowton and Ellerdine. He died in 1282, and the Feodaries of 1284-5 say plainly that \"Walter de Eyllesbur' (Aylesbury) holds the vills of Rowelton and Ellewur thin of Henry de Erdinton's heir, who holds of the King in capite.\" The Presentment of 1292 has one more statement as to these vills of Rowton and Ellardine, viz. that \" Walter de Eylesbury now holds them, the Jurors know not by what warranty.\" The Court summoned the said Walter to appear, and he was forced to fine half a merk to keep possession of the estate usque proximum parlia mentum. Walter de Eyllesbury, it elsewhere appears, was at this time exercising a right of free-warren in Rowelton and Elwurthin. Of Walter de Aylesbury I have already said much under another Rowton, and under Amaston.3 Of Rowton and Ellardine he soon divested himself, by a sale to Laurence de Ludlow, or his son Wil liam, for the Record leaves it uncertain whether the Father or Son made this important purchase. \u2014 A Fine was levied at Westminster on Nov. 25, 1293, and recorded on May 28, 1294, between Lau rence de Ludelawe (Plaintiff), and Walter de Aylesbury (Deforci ant) of the Manors of Rowlton and Ellardine, whereof was Plea of Convention.

For this William paid 100 merks to Walter. From the Inquest taken on the death of William de Ludlow in November 1316, it would seem that a mesne right iu Rowton and Ellardine had been always retained by the heirs of Robert le Strange. \u2014 \" William de Ludlow (deceased) had held the said vills under Fulk le Strange by service of one-sixth part of a knight's-fee, and by payment of 73s. rent.\" The gross value of the estates, to the deceased, was \u00a36. 16s. per annum? Roulton and Elwardyn were two of the estates which Lawrence de Ludlow, son and heir of William, conveyed about the year 1338 to certain Feoffees-in-trust, as before noticed.2 The estates re mained with the Ludlows for some generations. Of Undertenants in Rowton and Ellardine, I may name \u2014 Madoc de Ellardine, who occurs on Juries or otherwise in 1249, 1253, 1256, 1274, and 1278 ; William le Franceys and John de Rowelton, who occur in 1256 ; Hamo de Ellewordyn, a Juror in 1293; Thomas Fraunceis of Rowton, who occurs about 1310; and William Fraunceys of Rowton, who occurs in April 1324. Parochially, Rowton and Ellardine were subject to High Ercall. It would be difficult to overstate the antiquity of a grant whereby Wenlock Priory obtained the tithes of Rowton and Ellardine. Hamo Peverel was perhaps the Benefactor. Of course this intru sion into their Parish was offensive to the Patrons of Ercall Church, \u2014the Monks of Shrewsbury. On July 5, 1234, Henry, Abbot of Shrewsbury, agreed to pay to Humbert, Prior of Wenlock, a per petual ferm of 2 merks for these tithes.

My account of Prees must mainly therefore consist of mere scraps, or be derived from looal Charters, of which we have a series more numerous than important. The next mention, after Domesday, which I find of Prees, is in 1196, when Bishop Novant was under forfeiture and exile.

In return the Bishop enfeoffs him therein at a rent of 6\u00a7d. By the second Fine, John fitz William (Tenant) similarly surrenders two bovates in Pres, for which the Bishop pays him 40s.

In reply the Bishop's Attorney denied the holding of Pleas oi for bidden distress, and justified the other usages by immemorial pre cedent of former Bishops. To this the King's Attorney objected that whereas no Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry shared in the Conquest of England by William I., so the subsequent Bishops and their Church were to be considered as enfeoffed by others, and their Successor was bound to show some special document entitling him to the aforesaid liberties. Moreover the very lenity of the Episco pal rule at Pres was made an argument against its validity. \u2014 The Bishop had no pillory, nor tumberell, nor judgment, nor did he pro ceed to execution of judgment against trespassers in the assize of bread and beer, but let them go unpunished, after exacting some pecuniary fine.1 The cause, thus originated and argued, was ad journed to Lichfield, where the Justiciars proposed to be on January 27, 1293 ; but I do not find it resumed at the said adjournment. I take the prosecution to have been arbitrary and vexatious, both as to the general principle and the specific details. By Charter, dated at Lanercost, on January 28, 1307, King Ed ward I. empowers Bishop Langton to have a weekly market, on Wednesdays, at Pres, and to exercise Free-warren in the said Manor.2 In an Inquest of September 1310 it is incidentally stated that Reginald de Charnes held a virgate of land and 10 merks of rent within the Manor of Pres, under the Bishop of Chester, by services of two annual appearances at the Manorial Court of Pres, and of 2s. rent.

In the following year, the Surveyors thereunto deputed, valued the rents and profits of the Manor of Prees at \u00a346, and the improve ments thereof at \u00a3133. 10s. 8c?. per annum? As a sequel to this, the Manor of Prees was sold, on December 18, 1647, for \u00a31122. 6s. 2d. to one Henock Smith, and the \" Scite of the Manor of Prees\" was sold on April 21, 1648, to one Thomas Harpar, for \u00a3147. 13s. 5c?. How far these proceedings were reversed at the Restoration, I have no documentary proof. The Commissioners then appointed to inquire into these \"pretended sales\" are said to have \"greatly satisfied \" the several parties concerned.2 I cannot discover that the See of Lichfield retains any land, or other Manorial right whatever, in Prees. Of Undertenants, or residents, at Prees I may name Thomas de Prees, who attests about 1240-50, certain Deeds already given, and Philip de Prees, Clerk, and John his brother, who attest one of the same Deeds.3 This Philip de Prees was a noted man in his day. From his frequent appearances as an Attorney I take him to have been of the Legal profession. The Charters attested by, and some of them perhaps penned by, him, are very numerous. The earliest which I can quote, passed about 1231. It has been given under Sutton Maddock,4 where Philip de Prees was probably attending on behalf of Sir Ralph de Sandford (I.) . The latest of Philip de Prees's attestations are those of a Wrottesley Deed, between 1260 and 1280,5 and of a Bishton Deed between 1272 and 1277. Of the last Deed, John de Prees is also a witness.6 But Philip de Prees had a more important office than that of a Conveyancer. He was Clerk or Receiver to Robert de Grendon, during the first Shrievalty of the said Robert, a period which may be estimated as commencing in March 1250 and ending in October 1255. He again acted as Receiver, subsequent to the year 1259, and perhaps during Robert de Grendon's second Shrievalty, that is in 1265-6. His conduct in this capacity does not appear to have been free from question.7 1 \u2022 2 Vide Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica, Vol. I. pp. 2, 4, 8 ; and Vol. III. p. 42. *\u2022 Supra, Vol. II. p. 125, note 71. *> Shaw's Staffordshire, II. 288. 6 Supra, Vol. III. p. 19, note 38. l Rot.

By a Fine of October 28, 1199, Richard fitz Wil liam, Plaintiff in a suit of mort d'ancestre, against Sibil fitz Eynon and John her son, quitclaims a virgate and four acres in Derlaveston to them and their heirs. In return the said Sibil and John enfeoff the said Richard at 12c?. rent in one-third of the premises, viz. in 6 acres towards Hethe, 6 acres towards Pres, 6 acres towards San ford, and 6 acres of assart, under Northwude. I think that the above John, son of Sibil, was the person after wards called John de Darliston. \u2014 At the Assizes of November 1221, Henry de Dervlaweston withdrew his suit against John de Dervlaweston, whom he had charged with disseizing him of a tene ment in Tuddeley. Henry's Sureties de prosequendo were Ralph de Sanford aud Richard de Chesthull. We have seen that in 1224 Henry de Dorlaveston surrendered 2 virgates in Dorlaveston to Ralph de Sandford,1 a fact which accounts for the subsequent tenure of the Sandfords in Darliston. We have also seen John de Dorlaveston at issue with his Episcopal Suzerain in 1228 concerning lands in Dorlaveston.2 Lastly, we have seen the same or another John figuring as a Witness of Sandford Deeds at least as late as 1235,3 and it is clearly a second John, whom we shall find occurring about 20 years later.4 After him, there is scant mention of any Tenants of Darliston except the Sandfords. In 1327 Adam fitz William of Derlaston was Juror on a Sandford Inquest. Mickley. The Sandfords held a part of Mickley under the Bishops of Lichfield early in the 13th century. About 1241-1249 John fitz Yerverth was Sir Richard de Sandford's tenant here. Peter de Mitneleg, who occurs on an Uppington Jury in 1259, was possibly of this place. Later in the century we have local mention of Richard fitz William of Mitneleye and of Richard, Clerk of Mitneleye.5 In 1308, as we have already seen, the Sand fords were Mesne Lords of a part of Mitteneley.6 Wooliston.

It is just possible that Odo de Wilaus ton, occurring in 1236 and between 1242 and 1249, was identical with the above Odo fitz Eniow. Be that as it may, a certain Eudo (or Odo) de Willaveston had been succeeded by his son Thomas before January 1256, when Richard de Willaveston impleaded the said Thomas for a toft in Willaveston, which Richard claimed as heir of his father, Robert. Thomas, on the other hand, asserted that his father, Eudo, had had a grant thereof from the said Robert. The Jury found that Robert had died seized of the land. So his son, Richard, recovered the same. In another suit Richard fitz Robert, as heir of his father, claimed 6J acres in Wylaston against Thomas fitz Odo, but here the Plaintiff was unsuccessful. In a third suit, Thomas de Wyllas ton failed to convict Odo de Hodnet of having disseized him of some right of common in Morton, alleged to belong to Wyllaston. There can be no doubt that Thomas fitz Odo was identical with Thomas de Wylaston, who attests so many Prees and Sandford Deeds between 1256 and 1280.1 In two instances he is called Lord of Willaston, and at the Assizes of 1272 as Thomas de Wylardeston he sat as a Juror for Bradford Hundred. I suppose that the successor of Thomas de Willaston was Richard de Wylars ton, a Juror for Bradford Hundred at the Assizes of 1292, and Juror on a Sandford Inquest in 1308. The latter Inquest was also attended by one Henry de Wylaston. In 1320 we have had men tion of Roger, son of Richard de Wylaston ; but I take it, that John de Wylaston, who occurs in 1315, 1327, and 1335, was the successor of Richard. A Sandford Inquest of 1327 was attended by John, Roger, and Richard de Wylaston. In 1356, Thomas de Wylaston was a Juror on an Ightfield Inquest. The succession of a second family of Willastons seems to have been as follows. \u2014 About the year 1224 Richard de Wilauston and Adam his son attest a Wottenhul Deed. I also find the latter, as \" Adam de Wylasston,\" attesting a Styche Deed about 1230. In a third generation we have \" Robert, son of Adam de Wylaston,\" attesting Sandford Deeds between 1256 and 1280.2 This Robert was Lord of the vill of Wottenhull, which he granted, about 1260, to his son Richard. Under Wottenhull, another member of Prees, I shall give some further account of this family. 1 Supra, pp. 231 bis, 232. 2 Supra, pp. 231 bis, 232. ix. 32"], [288, "250 PREES Another family of Willastons was preceded by Edwin de Willa veston, who at the Assizes of 1203 withdrew a suit of mort d'an cestre which he had against Thomas fitz Walter. This Edwin occurs also in 1227 in conjunction with the same Thomas fitz Walter, as we shall see under Shavington. It was he whom we have seen attesting Sandford Deeds between 1232 and 1245. In one attestation (about 1232-42) this Edwin is followed by his son Reginald. This Reginald may or may not have been the person who, as Reinald de Wilvastone, or Wlavestone, attests two Deeds which have been given under Ightfield.1 Yet another family of Willastons was preceded by Robert de Willaston, whom we have seen to have been succeeded by his son Richard shortly before 1256. At the Assizes then held, Richard fitz Robert failed to prosecute his Writ of disseizin against Richard fitz Alexander for a tenement in Wylaston. His Sureties de prose quendo were William, son of Richard de Bechesleg, and Robert le Fevre of Bechesleg (probably Bletchley). We have heard of Richard fitz Alexander of Willaston before ; viz. as attesting Sandford Deeds, about 1240-49. Either he or Richard fitz Robert may have been identical with Richard fitz Godith of Willaston, who attests a Deed between 1256 and 1272; but more probably Richard fitz Alexander was the father of two brothers, William and Thomas fitz Richard, against whom jointly two Writs of novel disseizin issued in August 1257, the Plaintiff being Petronilla fitz Richard in one instance, and Emma, daughter of Walter de Harpcote, in the other. Tenements at Wylaveston were in each case the subject of dispute. A second Alexander de Willaston, probably of this family, occurs in 1315. Wottenhull. This member of Prees is now lost. I suppose it to have lain North-East of the town, in the direction of Millen Heath or Wooliston.2 At the Assizes of November 1221, Edith de Wottenhull failed to prosecute some suit against Robert de Wottenhull. The subse quent history of this member of Prees happens to be illustrated by a curious series of Deeds, the oldest of which, dating at least as early as 1224, I give in extenso. \u2014 1.

The Priest, mentioned in Domesday as a denizen of Prees, was probably a Co-Rector of the Church ; I say a Co-Rector, for I can not doubt that this Saxon Foundation was Collegiate. Indeed it seems to have remained so till the 13th century; for the Rescripts of Pope Innocent and Pope Honorius (already quoted under Sand ford) speak of two cotemporary Rectors of Prees. I cannot refer to any mention of a Rector or Parson of Prees as surely later than 1235 ; nor can I refer to any mention of a Vicar of Prees as surely earlier than 1280. \u2014 The interval will adumbrate the date when some Bishop of Lich field, whose proceedings are unrecorded, demolished the Parochial foundation and appropriated the bulk of its revenues to furnish forth a Prebendal Stall in Lichfield Cathedral. Henceforth we hear of a Prebendary of Prees ; of course non-resident and richly paid, and of a Vicar of Prees who did all the work of this extensive Parish, and whose primary endowment is quite problematical. The Taxation of 1291 mentions an Episcopal estate at Prees, and a Pre bend of Prees, but no Vicarage. In 1341 the Parish of Prees was taxed at 20 merks for the ninth of its wheat, wool, and lamb. The reason given for so low an assessment was that \" two portions of Prees Church constituted a Prebend in a remote part of Stafford shire,1 and were there taxed by the Abbot of Burton, as Collector for that County.\"2 The Valor of 1534-5 gives \u00a310 as the clear value of the Vicarage of Prees, in the Deanery of Salop.3 INCUMBENTS OF PREES.

PREBEND OF PIPA MINOR, alias PREES. The origin of this Stall in Lichfield Cathedral has already been pointed out. In the Taxation of 1291 it is called the Prebend of Prees and valued at \u00a326. 13s. 4>d.per annum? In 1292,\u2014 Sir Ralph de Hengham, a noted Justiciar of that period, had this Prebend. He sold the current year's tithe of the corn and hay of Sandford for \u00a35. Sir Ralph de Sandford, the purchaser, paid an instalment of \u00a32 on this account in June 1293, and a receipt for the same, dated at Prees, was given by William de Leycester, Hengham's Chaplain.2 In 2 Edw. II. (1308-9), Richard de Sand ford farmed the tithes of Sandford, Darliston, and Wooliston for 25 merks, 4 merks of which are acknowledged by Ralph de Heng ham himself, in a receipt dated at Shustok on 19 Sept. 1309.2 Ralph de Hengham died in 1311, and in June 1315 we have a re ceipt of \u00a310 due to him, his heirs, or executors, from Richard, Lord of Sandford, acknowledged by John de Hengham.2 John Clarel, Prebendary of Prees and Archdeacon of Stafford, died possessed of this Stall in June 1337. I refer elsewhere for a continued list of these Dignitaries.3 Nich olas Hethe, who had had the Prebend for one year (1360-1), be ing in 1388 a Canon of Hereford, still held a penal bond of Nicho las de Sandford, Senior, for \u00a335, doubtless on account of some un paid ferm of tithes. The real consideration seems to have been \u00a317. 10s. 4c?. and to have been paid in subsequent instalments. Similarly in August 1373, Nicholas de Sandford and Richard le Clerk of Derlaston acknowledge a debt of \u00a36. 13s. 4c?. to Master Richard de Bermingham, Canon of Lichfield and Prebendary of Prees.4 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Income of Richard Strete, Pre bendary of Pipa Minor, alias Preez, as \u00a319 jper annum, viz. \u00a33. 16s. from glebe land in Typton and Lichfield (Staffordshire) ; \u2014 4s. from perquisites of Court there;\u2014 and \u00a315 from tithes and other emolu- ments at Preez.5 2 Muniments at Sandford, from Blakeway's MSS. ;\u2014 collated with the Parochial Registers, and enlarged from other sources by the Ven.

Now it was worth 30s.\"1 There is no probability that Lacy's Tenant, William, continued to be represented at Moreton. The Says, who held Stokesay, Stoke upon Tern, and Wheathill, under Lacy in Henry I.'s time, also held Moreton. My idea is that, between the years 1195 and 1222, Helias de Say (II.) enfeoffed his next brother, Robert, in Moreton, for I find Robert de Say acting as Mesne-Lord of Stych and Aud ley (members of Moreton) in a Deed which must have preceded the date of Helias de Say's death (c. 1222). I further think that when Robert de Say became (by death of Helias without issue) representative of his family, he enfeoffed his younger brother, Hugh, in Moreton. A Lacon Deed which probably passed about 1200 1210 would make it appear that Robert de Say had a son, Hugh. If so, the said son died young and without issue ; \u2014 but I doubt the accuracy of the transcript of this Lacon Deed. We find Hugh de Say and Robert de Say attesting a Wottenhull Deed about 1224.2 These witnesses I take to be Hugh de Say, of Moreton, and Robert de Say, the Priest, third aud fourth brothers of Helias de Say, then deceased, and younger brothers of Robert de Say and Walter de Say, still living. I have yet another evidence that Hugh de Say was Lord of Moreton during the lifetime of his elder brother Ro bert. The very chief-rent which is reserved to Robert, as Lord of Styche, before 1222, is reserved to Hugh in a Deed which certainly passed before 1232, and yet Robert de Say was living in 1232 and was then amerced half a merk for some disseizin.3 As to Robert de Say, delegated to try a local Suit, as a Justiciar, 1 Domesday, fo. 256, a, 2. 1 Supra, page 251. \u25a0> Rot. Pip. 16 Hen. III., Salop. Nova I oblata."], [299, "261 MORETON SAT. about January 1241, I take him to have been the Churchman, the younger brother of both Robert and Hugh. All in the way of date that I can further state about Hugh de Say of Moreton is that in 1243 he withdrew the suit of Moreton Say from County and Hundred, and that he must have died about 1248-9, if it were true (as alleged) that a lease granted by him, and cancelled by his son \" immediately after his death,\" had been seven years dormant before January 1256. Again, when I see Hugh de Say and Robert de Say sitting on a Sandford Inquest in 1249 I feel assured that these are two sons of Hugh de Say of Moreton. Hugh, the elder, in 1250 procured, as we have seen, an entail of Stokesay and Stoke upon Tern, from his Uncle, Walter, and between 1250 and 1255, having succeeded the said Walter, transferred his interest in those two Manors to John de Verdon.1 But as to Moreton Say, that would again appear to have been the appanage of Hugh's younger brother, Robert, though the mesne tenure of Hugh went to John de Verdon. In accordance with the above facts, inferences, and surmises, the Hundred-Roll of 1255 says as follows. \u2014 \" Robert de Say is Lord of the Vill of Morton-de-Say in the Manor of Stoke, and he holds it of John de Verdon, and it is 1^ hides. It pays lc?. (Query 6c?.) motfee and 6c?. stretward. Hugh, father of the said Robert, with drew Morton from suit of County and Hundred 12 years since, thus damaging the Crown at the rate of 2s. per annum.\"'1 At the Assizes of January 1256 the Bradford Jurors reported that Robert de Say de Aldel' was not in due attendance. They meant Robert de Say of Moreton, I think, for Audley was then a member of Morton. And, at these same Assizes, the following cause was tried. \u2014 Eline, or Elyas, son of Richard Cadigan, sought to hold Robert de Say to the terms of an agreement made between Richard, father of Elyas, and Hugh de Say, father of Robert, whereby Hugh had demised to Richard a messuage and half-virgate in Morton for 10 years. The Plaintiff alleged that when only 3 years of the term had run, Hugh de Say died, and forthwith Robert de Say disseized the Plaintiff, so that 7 years of the said term, equal to damages of 100s., were now in arrear to the Plaintiff. It appears that the Plaintiff held neither Script nor Charter of the Lease, and could only allege a verbal demise by Hugh de Say : but he offered a Fine of one merk, that the truth of such verbal demise might be ascertained by Jury. Robert de Say, in absence of any ' Supra, Vol. V. p. 33. *- Rot. Hundred. II. 57."], [300, "262 MORETON SAY. written Deed, asked judgment in his own favour, not thinking that an action could lie, or an Inquisition be ordered, as to the fact of the alleged verbal agreement. The result does not appear on the Rolls, but the daughters of the Plaintiff were afterwards tenants of the Defendant at Audley. I find Robert de Say sitting on local Juries in 1257 and 1259. In the former instance he is described as \" of Audetleye.\" At the Assizes of September 1272 his name was on the panel for Bradford- Hundred, as Bsobert de Say of Morton, but was cancelled. He appears on other Juries of 1274, 1278, 1280, 1281, and 1284. The Feodaries of 1284-5 merely name Moreton Say and its mem bers as so many members of Stoke upon Tern, and as held under Theobald de Verdon. It appears from the Assize-Roll of 1292, that Robert de Say had served as a Coroner since the previous Iter (of 1272) and was still in office. Some irregularities were alleged against him. I find Hugh de Say sitting on a WTem Inquest in April 1290, that is I think in his Father's lifetime, for it is evident that he eventually succeeded to Moreton. He occurs as Lord of Moreton in January 1308, and March 1310. In March 1317 he was found to be Tenant of one-fourth of a knight's-fee in Morton, held of the estate of Theobald de Verdon, deceased, and worth 20s. per annum? He occurs again in 1318. Pursuant to a Writ of May 9, 1324, Robert de Say and -William de Say, Men-at-arms, were returned by the Sheriff of Shropshire as summoned to attend a Great Council, to be held at Westminster.2 Robert de Say was, I think, of Moreton. He occurs as a witness or Juror in 1332 and 1339. The Church of Moreton Say was originally a Chapel of Hodnet. It is not mentioned in the early Diocesan Registers, nor in Henry VIII.'s Valor. BLETCHLEY. This was originally a member of Moreton Say, and contributed 1^ hides of the 3 hides which Domesday assigns to that Manor. Persons who took their name from the place were enfeoffed in Bletchley by the elder branch of the Says, but so as to exclude any mesne interest of the younger branch, viz. the Says of Moreton Say. Hence Bletchley, though much nearer to Moreton Say than to Stoke upon Tern, is more usually considered a member of the latter. 1 Inquisitions, 10 Edw. II., No. 71. 2 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 1403, 1401."], [301, "MORETON SAY. 263 I have a few particulars of the descent of the Bletchleys. Very early in the 13th century \" Nicholas de Bleggeleg, for the souls' health of himself and his wife Sabina, gave, together with his body, to Lilleshull Abbey, the Mill of Blecheley, with the suit due there to from his estate.\"1 A very early Rent- Roll of Lilleshall Abbey contains an item, of 9s. 4c?. receivable yearly at Lady Day for Blegge leg Mill. Henry III.'s confirmation to Lilleshall speaks of the above gift as donacionem et concessionem quas Nicholas de Blecchel' fecit eisdem Abbati et Conventui de quodam molendino et quodam vivario cum pertinenciis in Blecchel'. Nicholas de Bletchley was succeeded by his son William. We have seen that about the year 1222 Helias de Say of Stoke granted to Haughmond Abbey, that rent of 12s. 4c?. which was arising from the land of Blecheslee, then held by William, son of Nicholas de Blecheslee. About the same time WTilliam, son of Nicholas de Blechley, \" concedes and allows\" his Father's grant of Blechley MiR to Lilleshall Abbey. He further gives the Canons power to raise the stank thereof as high as they pleased ; he gives the Vivary and all Le Mulnehul (The Mill -hill), and a house and curtilage outside his own doors, and two acres of assart towards Bromley which WTal ter the Miller held. He covenants that none of his heirs shall make a Mill at Blechley. For this the Canons gave him one merk.2 The Mill, thus conveyed, must have stood on the Bailey Brook, below Aychley and opposite Mickley. Sir Richard de Sandford, as Lord of the land on the western bank of the said brook, came to the following agreement with R. (Richard), Abbot of Lilleshull, between the years 1241 and 1249. Sir Richard allowed that the stank of Blecheley Mill should abut and lean upon his land of Mitteleg which John fitz Yerverth held. He also allowed the rais ing of the stank and the consequent agistment of water towards the land of Mitteleg, notwithstanding that arable land might be thus inundated, and notwithstanding that this back-pounding of water might cause impediment to the downward flow of water from Sir Richard's Mill of Avicheleg (Aychley). On the other hand the Abbot undertook to move no suit against Sir Richard, neither in a Court spiritual nor secular, concerning the Mill which Sir Richard had constructed at Avicheleg.3 About this time (1240-50), \"Robert, son of William de Blegge leg, gives to Lilleshull Abbey all his wood called Overe.\" The said wood commenced at Bleggeleg Mill, and reached along the rivulet i \u2022 2 \u25a0 3 Lilleshall Chartulary, fo. 62."], [302, "264 MORETON SAY. to Armitdeleford : then it was bounded by the Abbot of Comber mere's land (probably Chesthill Grange) : then it reached to Longe fordegate;1 and passed thence along a hedge, which divided the arable land of Bleggeleg from the wood of Overe itself, and so back to Bleggeleg Mill. This Deed further conveys half the Grantor's meadow, near the King's highway between Bleggeleg and Acheleg, and husbote and common pasture through all the Grantor's lands.2 The same Grantor, styling himself, \" Sir Robert de Bleggelg,\" gives to Lilleshall a half-virgate, held by Geoffrey Cort, in the vill of Bleggelg, and also that half of his meadow which Richard, son of Robert de Sanford, held.2 Lastly, the same Sir Robert gave to the same Abbey a certain meadow near Bleggeleg Mill, viz. that which lay below the Mill pound, between the two rivulets. He also conceded his father's grant of the said Mill with suit of his tenants, &c.2 In a short time we find this small estate of Lilleshall Abbey called \" the laud of Overe.\" In 1253-4 Robert, Abbot of Lille shull, concedes to P. C. W. and T. (four of his Tenants at Overe thus designated), and to their heirs, one-tenth of Overe, to be assarted. They are to pay a yearly rent of 16c?., and at each Tenant's death his best ox or cow, or 5s. in money, is to go to the Abbey. The Deed provides for free egress from Overe to Bleeche leg, and gives the Grantees a right of common in Walter de Say's Wood.3 The Grantor reserves a road from Bletchley past the Abbey-Mill to Armitelgeford.4 At the same period (1253-4) \" Robert, Abbot of Lilleshall con cedes to Jordan de Bleccheleg and his wife Aldith, daughter of Thomas le Luttele, one-fourth of the land which the said Thomas had held in Overe, reserving a rent of 4c?. aud a heriot of 2s. The Abbot further gives common pasture in the bosc of Walter de Say.\"6 But, to return to Bletchley itself, the Hundred-Roll of 1255 tells us that \" Robert de Blecheleg holds Blecheleg of Robert Corbet of Morton at an annual rent of 12s., and it is 1| hides, and pays 6d. for stretward and 6d. for motfee.

Here the Seigneury of John de Verdon, then Lord of Stoke upon Tern, is ignored ; but it appears clear that Corbet of Moreton Cor bet had purchased or otherwise acquired the mesne interest of Haughmond Abbey at Bletchley, such interest being previously re presented by a rent of 12s. 4c?., but now of 12s. As to Robert de Bletchley of 1255, we have seen that he was son of WTilliam fitz Nicholas. He sat as a Juror for Bradford Hundred at the Assizes of 1256 and 1272, and he occurs on local Juries of 1259 and 1274. In the Feodary of 1285 Bletchley is put down as a member of Stoke upon Tern, and Robert Corbet is said to hold the vill of Theobald de Verdon. This was undoubtedly correct, for the sub tenure of Robert de Bletchley had ere this been bought up by Ro bert Corbet. Hence by the Inquest taken in 1301 after Robert Corbet's death, it was found that \" he and his wife Matilda had been conjointly enfeoffed in the vill of Blechelee by Robert de Blechelee ; and that it was held under Theobald de Verdon, by a rent of 12s.\"1 Again, Matilda Corbet, dying in 1309, was found to have held the vill of Blecheley under Theobald de Verdon, but without pay ing any rent {nil reddendo)? I suppose she had redeemed the chief-rent, or commuted it for knight's service ; \u2014 for in the Inquest taken in 1317, on the death of Theobald de Verdon, it appears that the heirs of Thomas Corbet had held one-fourth of a knight's-fee in Blecchele under the deceased, and that the estate was worth 40s. per annum?

In 1203 this Hugh de Buchenhulle appears, I think, under the name of Hugh de Stuche, when he was amerced half a merk pro salso dicto. In or about the year 1222, the chief-rent of 12d. due from Hugh de Stuche's land was given to Haughmond Abbey by Helias de Say.1 The subsequent Tenants of this part of Styche occur as follows, but nothing transpires to show that they held under Haughmond Abbey. \u2014 William de Stuche occurs as a witness before 1240. He was a Juror for Bradford Hundred at the Inquests of 1255 and at the Assizes of 1256. He occurs on another Jury in 1259. John de Stuche and William Mangul of Stuche occur on a local Jury in 1274. Thomas de Stuche occurs on similar Juries in 1281 and 1284. His non-attendance at the Assizes of 1292 was reported by the Bradford Jurors. He occurs on a Market Drayton Inquest in 1319. In 1318 Wrilliam de Stuch attests a Moreton Deed; and, a few years later, William Stuch occurs as a tenant in Audley.2 As to the other part of Styche it was held together with Moreton Say (about 1196-1200) by Robert de Say. He enfeoffed Robert fitz Leisinc therein, by the following curious and ancient Deed. \u2014 Notum sit tarn futuris quam presentibus quod ego Robertus de Sai dedi Roberto filio Leisinc terram de Stucha que est inter meam sepem et inter sepem meorum hominum de Aldeleia (Audley) et inter divisam Hugonis de Buchenhulle, et quoddam pratum infra sepem meam per divisas ductum ; \u2014 in feudo et hereditate, sibi et suis heredibus, ex me et meis heredibus, libere et quiete tenendam, in bosco, in piano, in viis, in semitis, in aquis, pratis, in pascuis, et in omnibus liberis con suetudinibus, pro suo homagine et pro mi solidis modo in ingressu ; \u2014 in solidos inde annuatim adfestum Sti Michaelis mihi reddendopro omni servicio, excepto quod, si porcos habuerit plusquam quatuor, dabit mihi unum ex omnibus tantum, scilicet tercium meliorem ? et si ipse habuerit homines ibi, eandem habeant libertatem quam ipse de porcis suis.

It probably passed after the year 1222, when Robert de Say having succeeded his elder Brother, Helias, at Stoke, may be supposed to have surrendered Moreton as the appanage of his younger brother. Sir Ralph de Sandford's death, in or before 1235, gives the later limit of the Deed. \u2014 Robertus filius Roberti Belle dedi Radulfo de Sanfort et heredibus totam terram meam de Stuche, propter v marcas quas dedit ; \u2014 tenen dam et habendam de me et heredibus meis, sibi et heredibus suis in feudo, fye, in boscho, fye., sicut ego et ancessores mei melius et liberius habuimus et tenuimus ,- reddendo mihi et heredibus meis in solidos in die Michaelis pro omni servicio mihi pertinente, quos (solidos) ego et heredes mei eodem die pro eddem terra domino meo H. de Sai et he redibus suis pro firma per solvemus?

I take it to have been originally a member of Moreton rather than of Stoke-upon-Tern, though the Lords of Stoke seem to have retained the immediate Seigneury, or rather to have disallowed any mediate right of the Lords of Moreton.

Plaintiffs against Richard de Peulisdon in a suit where Warteshale is written as the place concerned. I know of no result to this liti gation. I have spoken of Master Richard de Pulesdon before.1 In 1285, he held the vill of Warranshall, a member of Stoke-upon-Tern, under the heir of Radulf de Albo-Monasterio, which heir held it under Theobald de Vernon. I presume that Radulf de Albo-Monas terio, thus mentioned, was some Cadet of the Warrens of Whit church, whose elder line was now represented by females ; but I can say no more about this Radulf, or his heir, or their mesne-tenure in Waranshall. Of Oldfield, a member of Moreton Say, and coupled with Waranshall, as above, I can quote but little. The Feodary of 1285 classes it as a member of Stoke. We have William-of-then-Oldefeld on a Wem Jury in 1284, Richard de Oldfeld on a Hinstock Jury in 1306, and Thomas de Oldfield on a Drayton Jury in 1314. Of Hulle, another member of Moreton Say, I may only state that James (Jaeopus) de Hulle attests an Audley Deed (hereafter to be set forth) about 1254-5. At the Assizes of 1272, Adam de Hull, who had brought an action de ingressu against James de Hull and his son Hugh, concerning a messuage and half-virgate in Hull, \" in the parish of Hodnet,\" did not prosecute the suit. Hugo filius Jacobi sat on the Inquest taken at Stoke in November 1274, on John de Verdon's death. At the Assizes of 1292, Hugh de Hulle (the above son of James, I think) was a Juror for Bradford Hundred. In March 1317, William de la Hulle was a Juror on the Inquest taken after the death of Theobald de Verdon ; but he perhaps be longed to another family.2 &ai Domesday mentions this Manor next after Moreton and as held by Roger de Lacy of the Norman Earl. \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Lai, and WUliam holds it of him.

Here one free man has half an ox- team, and there might be Supra, Vol. VIII. pp. 97, 98. **\" Vide supra, p. 217, note 1."], [307, "AUDLEY BROW. 269 one additional team (employed) . The value (in Saxon times) was 6s. {per annum). The present value is 2s. He (Roger de Laci) found it waste.\"1 There is some difficulty in identifying this Manor of Lai. Its Domesday tenure was precisely that of Moreton, and the fluctuations of its value since the Saxon \u00e6ra were in the same ratio as those of Moreton. Its Saxon owner, Eluui, was Lord also of part of Calver hall, and Calverhall is the next Manor to Moreton on the North- West. It being certain that Lai has been absorbed by some other Manor, I should suppose it likely to have been absorbed by Moreton, and, though the reputed hidage of Moreton does not appear to have been increased, that is no conclusive argument against my hypo thesis. Indeed, taking the analogy of Stoke-upon-Tern, another of Lacy's Manors, we should expect Moreton to have decreased in hidage ; and so, if its hidage remained the same, we may suppose that its real area was enlarged. I will, without quite insisting on the identity of the two, say under Lai what has to be said about \u2014 AUDLEY, now AUDLEY BROW. This either was originally, or became a member of Moreton. The word Audley (Saxon \u00c6ld-leag or \u00c6ld-lah) signifies Old-Lee, and so may be taken etymologically to represent the Lai of Domesday. We have seen that about the year 1200, Robert de Say of More ton spoke of the men of Aldeleia as his Tenants.2 The following Deed passed about 1254-5, and therefore while the Grantee was hardly yet of age. I give it in brief. \u2014 Ricardus Cadegan dedi Radulfo domino de Sonford totam Mam terram quam tenui in villa de Aldelewe ,- \u2014 habendam et tenendam de me et heredibus meis sibi et heredibus suis in feodo et hereditate ; \u2014 reddendo capitali domino 12c?. die Sti Petri ad Vincla.

We have seen Eline, or Elyas, son of Richard Cadigan, claiming other property at Moreton-Say in January 1256. He left two daughters, Alyna and Margery, who, styling themselves \" daughters of Elkyn Cadugan,\" concede and quitclaim to Ralph de Sandford all right in the land which Richard Cadugan, their Grandfather, formerly held in Aldeleg.

Sir Odo de Hodenet, Robert Corbet, Roger de Preston, Hugh de Stile (Steel), and Robert, son of Adam de Wylaston.1 These names suggest 1270-5, as the proximate date of these Quitclaims. I hear nothing more of a Sandford estate in Audley. Meantime, though Robert de Say of Moreton is styled (as we have seen) \" of Audley\" in 1256 and 1257, it is clear that certain land in Audley was retained by his elder brother, Hugh, and had been conveyed by the said Hugh (about 1254) to John de Verdon, as part of the great exchange which then took place. Hence, on the death of John de Verdon in 1274, the Inquest states that he had held half a carucate of land in Aldeleg, which land he had obtained by exchange for land in Ireland. It was worth \u00a32. 14s. ll\\d. per annum? The further statement that this land was held by Verdon of the heirs of Lacy of Ludlow, and neces sitated suit of Court to Ludlow, cannot have any very pregnant meaning, seeing that Verdon himself was one of Lacy's Coheirs. On March 24, 1317, William de Aldele was foreman of the Jurors who made Inquest as to the estate of Theobald de Verdon (II.) , then deceased. These Jurors said nothing about his receipts from Audley; but an Escheator's-Roll, drawn up within the next 10 years, accounts for an annual rent of \u00a31. 3s. 8c?. from \"Aldeleye within the Manor of Stoke super Time,\" and which was payable on 3 tenements, held for life, by Wdliam Stuche, of the inheritance of Theobald de Verdon, and which rent was an escheat in manu Regis, because Theobald's heirs had not as yet established their right thereto. The following Deed, or rather transcript, which purports to be dated at Aldeleg on Nov. 1, 12 Edward I., belongs, I think, to the 12th year of Edward IL, viz. 1318.\u2014 \" Richard de le Het (Heath) gives to Hugh Clerk of Huls, his wife Edith, and his heirs by her, all his land in the fields of Overe.3 Witnesses, Hugh de Say of Morton, William de Stuche, Richard de Sumervile of Aderdeleg, Wdliam de Alderley (Qy.

It is better in a case of much obscurity to give the exact text of the Re cord. After surveying Roger de Lacy's Manors of Moreton and Lai, Domesday continues thus. \u2014 \"In hoc Hundredo (scilicet Odenet) tenuit Edric unam bere wicham, Hotune, de dimidia hida, et geldabilem ; et non poterat h\u00e6c terra separari a Manerio Stoches quern tenet Rogerius Laci. H\u00e6c terra est appreciata in ipso Manerio, in Recordin Hundredo.\"2 There is some ground for a conjecture (but I do not trust it), that, in the time of Henry I. or Stephen, when Lacy's Fief was under forfeiture, the seigneury over Hopton may have been given to the then Baron of Pulverbatch. Of this matter I wdl speak pre- sently. Meantime we have direct evidence that Lacy's tenant at Stoke-upon-Tern continued to be tenant of the berewick of Hopton; for the said Tenant gave the very estate now under consideration to Haughmond Abbey. In 1172 (as we know from Pope Alexander's Confirmation) the Canons of Haughmond possessed \" half a hide in Hoppton, by gift of Elyas de Say, and with assent of Hugh his son.\" Other gifts which the Canons had, now and afterwards, in Hopton and Espley must be treated of elsewhere. They were in a different Manor than that of which Domesday speaks, as Hotune, and were not in Lacy's Fief. The Hundred-Roll of 1255, treating of Hopton generally and distinctively, marks well this difference. \u2014 \u25a0** The Abbot of Hagemon holds 2\\ virgates in the said vill, of the fee of Stoke, and answers in Scutages, when Scutage is being levied, for his relative proportion.\"3 The Feodaries of 1284-5 call the Abbot of Haughmond's tene ment in Hopton \"half the vill,\" and declare that the \"Abbot held it of Philip Marmion, who held it in capite.\" This was tantamount to saying that the estate was reputed to be of the Fee of Pulver batch : but there is not the smallest probabdity that such was really the condition of Hopton. The Inquest taken in 1317 states distinctly that the Tenant of 1 Supra, Vol. VIII. pp. 68, 69. 2 Domesday, fo. 256, b, 1. 3 Rot. Hundred. II. 58-"], [310, "272 MARCHAMLEY.

It is obvious therefore that this part of Hopton was still held of the Fief of Lacy and not of Pulverbatch ; and that while the estate had been given by De Say to the Abbey, the services due thereon had never been abandoned by Lacy's heirs. I will speak of the estate, thus and otherwise acquired by Haugh mond Abbey, at Hopton and Espley, in the next Chapter. \u2014 jHardjamlep- \" Raynald the Sheriff holds Marcemeslei of the Earl.

The land lay in Espley, in Hopley, and in Hopton, \u2014 in that part of Hopton which was not of Lacy's Fief. At present I will speak chiefly of those four other hides which constituted Mar chamley proper.

He seems to have held something under his neighbour, the Lord of Hawkstone. In the Pipe-Roll of 1185, John de Marchemesleg is recorded as paying an oblatum of one merk, which he had proffered \" for having a trial-at-law concerning the customs and service which Roger de Hauckestan required from him.\" I think it was as a Coparcener, or Claimant, or adjoining Proprie tor, rather than as having any larger right in Hopley, that \" John de Marchemesleg gave and confirmed, to Haughmond Abbey, Hop peley with its appurtenances, wishing that his body might be buried at Haughmond unless he happened to die in Essex.\" This Deed probably passed about 1190, being attested by William fitz Alan, Hugh Pantun, Hugh de Say, Peter de Mortun, Odo de Hodenet, Robert de Say, Jordan de Hespelee, Hugh de Loscefort, Roger de Hefkeston (Hawkstone), and Walter de Hopton.2 By another Deed (about 1190-4) John de Merchemesley con cedes and gives to the same Abbey a certain part of his wood, viz. from the path which led from Kentenesdene (Kinstone), between his own wood and the Abbot's wood, towards Hodnet, according to the boundary of certain ditches, up to the rivulet where his Vivary was situated ; which Vivary the Grantor retained, with power to make it as large as he liked, saving all easements for the Abbot's live-stock at Hoppeley. This grant was in augmentation of tha\"t land of Hoppeley which he had previously given to the Abbey. He adds to the gift a right of common in the whole land of Kentenes dene, like that which the men of Kentenesdene enjoyed in Hcppe leg.

These parties agreed to a partition of their inheritance by a Fine levied at Westminster on June 11, 1206. It was agreed that 3 carucates in Merchemelee (Shropshire) and one carucate in Mereton (Warwickshire)1 should remain to Richard de Essex and his wife Johanna, and two caru cates in Berslede and Clakinton (Essex) should remain to Ernulf, son of Reginald de Hesdin, and his wife Cecily. Henry de Audley seems to have obtained some ingress, rightfully or not, into the estates of Richard de Essex. At the Assizes of November 1221, a Suit of mort d'ancestre which Richard de Essex and Matilda {sic) his wife had against Henry de Audley, concern ing lands in Shropshire and Warwickshire, was adjourned to Hilary Term, at Westminster. At the Warwick Assizes of January 1222 it was further adjourned to Easter Term, Richard de Essex and his wife Matilda being again named as Plaintiffs. Nor is a Fine levied at Westminster on January 20, 1223, much more accurate as to names, for it represents Robert de Essex and his wife Johanna (Plaintiffs) quitting their claim of mort d'ancestre on the Manor of Marchemeleg, in favour of Henry de Audithelcg for the great sum of 220 merks. Henry de Audley, thus becoming Lord of Marchamley, had next a negotiation with his Suzerain, John fitz Alan, who reduced the Knight's-service, due on the Manor, from oue fee, to a fourth part of a fee. Hence Henry III.'s Charter to Audley (passing in May 1227) ratifies, inter alia, the following release. \u2014 Ex relaxacione et quieta clamacione Johannis filii Willielmi filii Alani servicium unius militis quod de Manerio de Marchemeleg fieri suit consuetum, usque ad quartam partem servicii unius militis.

There were four hides therein. It did suit neither to County nor Hundred.

The Abbot had sued the Plaintiff for the premises, under Writ of novel-dis seizin, and before Master Symon de Wautou and his associates, Justices Itinerant at Salop ; and the Grantor had allowed the Ab bot's right as an appurtenance of his Grange of Hopley. The pre sent Deed further allows the Abbot to enclose and cultivate the premises ; but retains the Grantor's right of common therein, after harvest. The Abbot is also to grind toll-free in the Grantor's Mill called La Bechemulne, in return for the Abbot's having conceded an abuttment for the mill-stank, and back-poundage of water up to a certain oak on the paths between Hodenet and Kentenesdene and between Hopley and Marchimeley.

The personal service due thereon, viz. a fourth of a knight's-fee, in time of war, was due to John fitz Alan (he was dead at the time), but was now made returnable by the Lord of Loskes ford, though at the charges of the Lord of Marchumle.3 Henry de Audley II. dying in 1276, had two-thirds of Marchum leg and Kettensden ; \u2014 value \u00a38. 16s. 9d.per annum?

Hugh de Louther, the King's Attorney, objected that Audley could show no specific grant of the above franchises, nor could he show that continuous usage since the reign of Richard I., which a recent act of Royal grace would have made a sufficient defence. He ought not therefore to be admitted to any proof of the usage of his Ancestors' Feoffors, before the alleged purchase. The Suit was adjourned to Lichfield, but the result does not appear. I gather from an abstract of the Inquest, taken in 1299, on Nicholas de Audley's death, that his estate in Marchumleye and Kentensdon was surveyed.1 On Thomas de Audley's death in 1308, Marchumleie was valued at \u00a322. 6s. 1 \\d. per annum, and his tene ments in Kentenesden (Kinstone) at \u00a33. 4s. G\\d. The latter in cluded a rabbit-warren {Cunicularium) , yielding 6c?. per annum. The Advowson of Marchomley Chapel, the only Advowson which Aud ley had in Shropshire, was valued at 40s. per annum? In the Nomina Villaram of 1316, Nicholas de Audley (II.) duly appears as Lord of Marchumleye. The Inquest on his death, in the same year, makes the Hamlet of Marchumley, as well as Ightfield and Gravenhunger, to be members of Red-Castle.3 Marchamley Chapel. This was originally subject to Hodnet, but founded by the Lords of the Manor with the probable view of making it independent. Indeed we have seen that in 1308, the Ad vowson, worth 40s. per annum, was in the Audleys. Bishop Langton, dying in November 1321, left a cause pending between Philip de Say, Rector of Hodnet, and Geoffrey de Wolse legh who, assuming himself to be Rector of the Chapel of Mar chumle, contested Philip de Say's right to the great tithes arising from all assarts in Marchumle. On October 19, 1322, Bishop Northburgh directs his Commissaries to proceed with, and decide, this cause. The Valor of 1534-5, shows that the Rectory of Hodnet was charged with an annual pension of \u00a33, payable to the Free Chapel at Marchomley? Probably this was the sole endowment of the Chapel, and represented some surrender of tithes to the Rectors of Hodnet. The sometime existence of this Chapel was known to Tradition at the beginning of the present century. 1 Calend. Inquis. Vol. I. p. 150. 2 Inquisitions, 1 Edw. II., No. 63. 3 Inquisitions, 10 Edw.

They constituted, I think, a part of four hides in which, according to Domesday, Raynald Vicecomes had as yet no Feoffee. However, within ten years after Domesday Los ford was held by one Hunald, as we shall presently see. This Hunald proves also to have had a Feoffment at Preston Boats,1 a member of Upton Magna, where Raynald Vicecomes must have been again his Feoffor. Earl Hugh's spurious Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey con firms the tithes of Opton (Upton Magna), Prestona Supra (Preston on Severn) and Locesford as if they were his own demesnes ; \u2014 a fallacy which I have already exposed in the two first cases.2 The same Earl's less suspicious Charter assigns the grant of two-thirds of the tithes of Opton to Warin Vicecomes, and the grant of two thirds of the tithes of the demesnes of Loskesfort aud of Prestone to Hunaldus.3 Henry I.'s Charter to the Abbey says how \" Hunal dus gave thereto the tithes of Preston and of Loscafort and the tithes of his own wild mares {decimam equarum suarum agrestium),\" including the grant among those which had been sanctioned by Earl Roger or one of his sons, Hugh or Robert.4 The Charters of Stephen, Henry II. , and Henry III. describe the grant in a similar way ; but Bishop Clinton's Charter, confirming some Charter of Earl Hugh, not now in existence, limits the grants of tithes in Pres ton and Loschesford to two-thirds of the demesne-tithes of each place.5 Bishop Durdent's Charter, in mentioning these tithes, places Locheford in the same clause with Hodnet, and Preston in the same clause with Opton.6 Enough of these Charters has now been quoted to show the un doubted state of the case, viz. that before the death of Earl Hugh (July, 1098) Hunald had been enfeoffed in Losford and in Preston, by Rainald, the Lord Paramount of Marchamley and Upton Mag na, and that Hunald, thus enfeoffed, had granted two-thirds of his demesne-tithes as a direct aid to the Monks of Shrewsbury. The remaining third, in each case, probably went to the respective Rec tors of Hodnet and Upton Magna. The next question is, \" Who was this Hunald ?\" That he was father of that Roger fitz Hunald who gave Rea (another member 1 Not Preston Brockhurst, as suggest ed in the History of Shrewsbury (Vol. II. p. 26); where also Hunald is wrongly identified with the Saxon, Hunnit. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 208. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 3. 4 \u2022 5 Ibidem, Nos. 35, 325. si Ibidem, No. 61."], [316, "278 MARCHAMLEY. of Upton) to Haghmon Abbey,1 there cannot be a doubt. But Roger fitz Hunald had two brothers, viz. Robert fitz Halufri, who was his Suzerain at Rea, and therefore his elder brother, and another brother, the initial letter of whose name was R., but whom we may at once call Richard fitz Halufri, for so he is named in a document which I shall have to quote hereafter. My further ideas on this subject are at present unfortified by adequate proof, but, as they square with all known facts, I will here state them. I think that Rainald's Domesday Tenant at Stanton Hineheath and other places, though his Christian name alone is given, might properly be called Richard fitz Halufri. I think that Hunald, of Earl Hugh's time, was Richard's son and heir, and that it was Hunald who augmented the Fee of Stanton by acquisitions at Rea, Preston Boats, Roden, Rodenhurst, and, I may now add, Losford. It is clear that Roger fits Hunald, his younger son, had Rea. It is clear too, that Robert fitz Halufri, probably Hunald's eldest son, continued the line of Stanton. As to Richard fitz Halufri, he was probably the second brother, aud it will appear hereafter that he was Mesne Lord of Hopton, a place which, like Losford, was one of the original members of Marchamley. After the \u00e6ra of Richard fitz Halufri, I find nothing to connect either Hopton or Losford with the Fee or family of Stanton. There must have been some change, which reunited both places under the Fee of Marchamley. The persons now to be men tioned must be considered as holding Losford or parts thereof under the Lords of Marchamley. \u2014 We have seen Hugh de Loskesford attesting a grant of John de Marchomley about 1190^*. In 1199 Hugh de Lokesford was sued by Ralph de la Cleie and Sibil, his wife, for a hide in Lokesford which the Plaintiffs claimed under Writ of mort d'ancestre. Hugh, by a Fine, levied October 29, 1199, acknowledged the premises to be the right and inheritance of Ralph and Sibil, who, in turn, allowed him to hold the premises for life, paying a pair of spurs or 2c?., as a rent to themselves. After Hugh's decease the land was to revert to the Plaintiffs and their heirs. The Pipe-Roll of 1202 e.xhibits Robert de Lokeswrd as having been amerced half a merk by Geoffrey fitz Piers, pro salso clamore. The debt is renewed, and discharged, in 1204 as that of Hugh de Lokeswrde. On the death of Hugh de Losford, of course Ralph de la Cleie and his wife entered on possession.

The case was adjourned to Warwick, Ralph and Sibil committing their interests to their son, Robert.1 Probably the dispute was really one of boundary between Prees and Losford. At these same Assizes, the aforesaid Ralph and Sibil claimed, under another Writ of mort d'ancestre, half a virgate in Loskesford then held by Wrerric de Loskesford. It was proved that Sibil's mother, Swanilda fitz Werric, had died seized thereof, and that Sibil was her heir. The misericordia of WTerric, the Tenant, was insured by Helias Cocus.2 In September 1224, the Justices sitting at Salop amerced Ralph de Cley and Sibil his wife half a merk for some disseizin.3 We have seen that about the year 1230, Richard, son of Hugh de Los ford above mentioned, was exchanging Cheswardine-Mill for land in Wellington.4 But in 1240 we find him suing the son of Ralph de Cleia, under Writ of mort d'ancestre, for a carucate in Loskes ford, that very estate, I presume, of which his Father had disin herited him by the Fine of 1199. Hugh fitz Ralph, as Ralph de Cley's son is called, had enfeoffed Roger le Conestable and Alice his wife in one-third of a carucate in Loskesford. The other two thirds he held himself. As Warrantor or Owner of the whole he was sued by Richard fitz Hugh ; but obtained a quitclaim and Fine from the latter, by payment of 40s.6 Had the Defendant in this Action known of the Fine of 1199 he might have stopped the suit of mort d'ancestre in a cheaper way, viz. by showing that the Plaintiff's Father could not have died, seized in dominico ut de feodo.

Hugh de Say, Robert's father, had given the Plaintiff a written Lease of the said moiety for 32 years. Eighteen years had run while Hugh de Say was living, and fourteen years had to run when Robert de Say disseized the Plaintiff. Judgment went for the Plaintiff, viz. that he do recover his full term. In February and June 1263 Hugh de Albo Monasterio has Writs against James de Audley and others, for disseizing him of a tenement in Loskesford. In 1272 we find that Hugh de Cley had been succeeded by a son, Roger, \u2014 probably the Roger de Loskesford of 1256. This Roger, son of Hugh le Cley, as his name is written on the Assize-Roll of 1272, had seized a messuage and 32 acres in Loskesford, on the ground that Alan de Loskesford (the tenant thereof) had been exe cuted for felony. He was sued for the same by William, son and heir of the said Alan, whose right he at length allowed, William paying a sore hawk, for the recognition.1 At these same Assizes, three daughters and coheirs of William de Albo Monasterio were suing James de Audley (II.) for three parts of a messuage and carucate in Loskesford, saying that James de Audley (I.) had disseized Hugh de Albo Monasterio, their Uncle, of the same. The three Ladies who prosecuted this suit were Ali anore wife of Robert le Strange, Joan wife of William de Barentyn, and Matilda wife of Robert de Brascy. A fourth Sister, Berta, and a fourth share of the estate were excluded from the suit be cause Berta did not join in the prosecution. The reason for her not doing so will appear elsewhere. The cause was adjourned till James de Audley (II.) should be of age.2 That Losford was now a mere member of Marchomley is proved by the Inquest, taken in November 1273, on the death of James de Audley (II.) . He had held Marchomley of Fitz Alan; but the service due thereon, viz. one-fourth of a knight's service, in war time, was returnable by the Lord of Loskesford, as Audley's deputy. The deputy's charges were provided out of Marchomley.3 In June 1276 Adam de Loskesford occurs on a Jury-list ; and in 1281 Robert de Loskesford sat on an Inquest at Wem. In 1285 one Richard de Loskesford was a Coparcener in Gravenhanger. In 1308 the Tenements of Thomas de Audley, deceased, in Loskesford, were valued at \u00a34. 10s. 6c?. per annum, and Kinstone and Loscas ford are treated as if members of Marchamley.

The meaning of this is apparent, though the accuracy is doubtful, for Red-Castle belonged to a different Fief from Marchomley. How ever on this occasion the income from Lolkeswode alone is put at \u00a35. 12s. 6d.per annum, viz. 18s. for the rent of a free tenant, and \u00a34. 14s. Qd. from the rents of Nativi.1 Subsequent Inquisitions on the deaths of the Audley s or their Heirs usually name Losford as a member of Red-Castle. HAWKSTONE. I have said that Hawkstone must have been originally a member of Marchamley. Nevertheless it is clear, from the entry given under Marchamley,2 that in the year 1185 Hawkstone and Mar chamley were independent of each other, or at all events, that, if there was any dependence, it was that of the Lord of Marchomley on the Lord of Hawkstone. Perhaps John de Marchomley, be sides his tenure in Marchomley which was immediate under Fitz Alan, also held something mediately under Roger de Hawkston. A few years later and we have Roger de Hefkeston attesting a Deed of John de Marchamley. Next after Roger de Hawkston, we come to \u2014 Hugh de Hauckeston, who, with John his son, attests a Hopton Deed about 1230,3 and who is called Hugh de Evecheston in a Sandford Deed of nearly the same date. This Hugh attests several undated Charters, and also a Woolerton Deed which passed on Aprd 10, 1241 . John de Hauckeston succeeded his father, Hugh, and occurs in 1242, as we have seen under Cound.4 He is also a witness of various local Deeds ranging between the years 1253 and 1281. In Hilary Term 1254 the Abbot of Shrewsbury was suing John de Haucheston and Adam de Kent, for some trespass. In 1256 John de Hawkstone was Audley's Bailiff at Edgmond. In a testing clause, about the year 1280, John de Hafketon is followed by John his son.5 Perhaps therefore John de Haukeston, who occurs as a Juror and witness in and about the year 1284, should be called \u2014 John de Haukeston (II.) . Of him however I can say nothing further, unless it be he who attests a Leighton Deed about 1300.6 Meanwhile one \u2014 1 Inquisitions, 10 Edw.

In an Inquest of 8 Henry V. (1420) Haukeston is included among the members of Red-Castle.5 HOPTON, ESPLEY, and HOPLEY. Half of Hopton, and the whole of Espley and Hopley, seem to have formed those 1^ hides, which Domesday treats as the tenement of one Walter under Rainald Vicecomes, Lord of Marchamley. WThen William fitz Alan (I.) recovered his inheritance in 1155, his tenant, in at least a part of this estate, was one Osbert, vari ously called \" de Hopton,\" \"de Espley,\" and \" de Hopley.\" Rich ard, Lord of Marchamley, and Richard fitz Halufri (probably a bro ther of Robert fitz Halufri, Lord of Stanton Hyneheath), had or assumed to have some claim on this estate, but whether as Copar ceners, or as Mesne-Lords, or as Owners of adjoining estates of doubtful boundary, I cannot say. Helias de Say's interest in this part of Hopton is equally difficult to estimate or to account for. However, by the concurrence, necessary or only formal, of all these parties, the whole of Hopley, and half a virgate in Hopton, passed to Haughmond ; and William fitz Alan, as Seigneural Lord, sanc tioned the transfer, by the following Charter, which we must date between 1155 and 1160. \u2014 Willielmus filius Alani omnibus filiis matris Ecclesie salutem.

The heir of Osbert de Hopton, de Espley, or de Hopley, was Walter de Hopton, perhaps that Walter, who, in 1165, is said to hold a Muntator's fee in Fitz Alan's Barony.2 About the year 1200, \" WTalter de Hopton concedes and gives to the Canons of Haghmon all his right and claim to a third of Hop ley ; also with consent of Thomas, his heir, he concedes, gives, and confirms, that half-virgate in Hopton which Osbert de Hopton held.

The same Roger, son of Thomas, attests a Deed, about 15 years later;5 but his family, which at no time held more than a share of the estate under notice, seems gradually to have sunk into obscurity. Reverting now to the close of the twelfth century we find one Jordan de Hespelee attesting in a position which would suggest his having a share in this estate. And from 1200 to 1259, a person or persons, called Robert de Espley, had not merely an interest but the chief apparent interest in the same. The following dated no tices of this person, or these persons, I offer first. In 1203 Robert de Espeley was amerced half a merk pro salso dicto. At the Assizes of August 1226, Robert de Espeleg was found to have unjustly dis seized William, Abbot of Haghmon, of common pasture in Hagh mon. Damages of 12c?. were given.6 The Feodaries of 1240 give Robert de Esple as holding one-fourth of a knight's-fee in Hopton, 4 Ibidem, so. 117-b. 5 Infra, page 285. 15 Abbreviatio Placitorum, p. 103. 1 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 114, b. 2 Liber Niger, Vol. I. p. 144. 3 Chartulary (ut supra), so. 114-b."], [322, "284 MARCHAMLEY. under Fitz Alan.1 Robert de Espeleg occurs as Juror on an In quest of 1249. The Hundred- Roll of 1255 says that \" Robert de Espele holds one-fourth of a knight's-fee in Hopton and in Espele of John fitz Alan, by service of one Montarius for three weeks, in war-time, at Fitz Alan's Castle of Oswestry. And Robert de Espele was to perform the said Castle-guard at his own cost. And the aforesaid vill of Hopton was H hides. Robert de Espele did suit to County and Hundred and (paid) 6c?. for stretward, and 6c?. for motfee\"\"- (the sums proportionate to 1\\ hides). Robert de Esp ley occurs in Juries or testing-clauses of 1256, 1256-7, and 1259. At the Assizes of 1256 he failed in two prosecutions against Odo de Hodnet, one for erecting a hedge in Espele, the other for making a foss in Hopton, to the injury of the complainant's tenements there. The Haughmond Chartulary supplies further but undated notices of at least two persons, called Robert de Espeley. \u2014 I presume it to have been about 1230, and with reference to his dispute with the Abbot, that \" Robert de Espeleg granted to the Abbey, for 3 merks paid down, and at a rent of 4c?., pasturage for 50 sheep, 24 oxen, and 30 other animals {averia), in his land of Hopton. Witnesses, Sir William de Stanton ; Philip, Chaplain ; Alexander, his son; Hugh de Haukeston; and John, his son.\"3 About 1235-40 (as I think) \" Robert de Espeleg concedes and quitclaims to William, son of Philip de Hopton, and his heirs all right in two acres of land which the said William had of Haghmon Abbey. Witnesses, Sir Hodo de Hodenet, Hugh de Hauckeston, and Roger de Marchimeleg.\"3 Between the years 1268 and 1272 \"Robert Espeleg\" gave and confirmed to Haghmond Abbey, 2 solidates of rent in the vill of Hopton, issuing out of a messuage, croft, and 4 acres of land which Michael de Hopton sometime held.

Witnesses, Sir John (read Odo) de Hod net, William his son, John de Hafketon, and John his son.1 The same Grantor as \" Master John, Lord of Espleg,\" made a grant of lands in Hopton to one William Tudor,1 but the Deed is not preserved. About 1280-4, Master John de Espley will have conveyed his whole estate, either to Sir Odo de Hodnet or his son William. Hence the Feodaries of 1284-5 say that William de Hodnet holds half the vill of Hopton under Richard fitz Alau for one-fourth of a knight's-fee ; and that the same William holds the vill of Espley under the same Richard, who held in capite in both instances. Between the years 1284 and 1292 Sir Wrilliam de Hodnet grants to Richard Cocus of Hopton aud his heirs half a tract of waste {di midium ruralem vasti) in Espley, bounded by the new foss of Sir Wil liam de Hodnet Lord of Espley.2 The Grantee pays 2s. down and furnishes a great knife {cultellum) for the Grantor's kitchen. He is to pay a rent of one halfpenny, and not to assign the premises to Jews or Great Lords.3 Witnesses, Adam de Purton, Henry de Savinton, William de Calverhall. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, the Earl of Arundel is entered as Lord of the vill of Horton, in Bradford Hundred. I conceive that Hopton is meant. William de Hodnet's tenure of Hopton, under Fitz Alan, remained with his heirs general, the Ludlows, for several generations. Haughmond Abbey Fee. The interest acquired and fostered by Haughmond Abbey, in Hopley, Hopton, and Espley, is illus trated by a number of documents, which would only have inter rupted my attempt to trace the descent of the fee-simple. \u2014 About 1253-63, Alexander, Abbot of Haghmon, grants to Wil liam, son of William Smith {Fabri) of Kentenesdene and to his 1 Chartulary (ut supra), fo. 117. person is described by two titles. 3 Magnis dominis injustificialibus, \u2014 i.e. Suzerains, too great to be subject to the G-rantor's jurisdiction.

Witnesses, John de Hauckeston, Robert de Espeley, Henry de Pechesey. About the same time Richard Smere, son of Thomas Wedircoke of Hopton, quitclaims to Haghmon his right in a half-virgate and capital messuage which he held of the Abbey in the vill of Hopton, also in a noke, messuage, and croft, which Ralph, Vicar of Hodnet, held under the Grantor* in Hopton ; also he quitclaims all his seigneury, service, and rent, in half a virgate which Roger, his brother, held of him, and in a noke, with a messuage and croft, which Michael fitz Edric held of him, and in 3 acres which Sibbota, daughter of the said Michael, held of him. Witnesses ; \u2014 as in the last Deed. About the year 1290, Sibil de Penington, widow of Master John de Espley, releases a rent of 16d. which she received in the way of dower, from the Abbot of Haghmon, out of that half-virgate1 which the Canons bought from her late husband. Witnesses, Wil liam Tuder of Hopton,2 Richard Smethe of Hopton, William Horde, Richard Robert of Astley. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Abbot of Haghmon a carucate of land in Hoppley, worth 12s. per annum, and 4s. assized rents in Hopton.3 We have seen Robert, son of Adam de Preston, named as Tenant of half a virgate in Hopton about 1280. He had since held it under the Abbey by 4s. rent. But about the year 1310, he sold it, with a messuage, for 4 merks (paid him in great necessity) to Richard Cocus of Hopton, retaining a rose-rent to himself. Witnesses, Richard Tuder of Hopton, Roger de Wekineshall, and Richard de Lakyn. On July 15, 1307, Abbot Richard of Haghmon demises to Richard, son of William de Kentenesdene, a parcel of land in Hopley, towards Marchomley, near the road which led from Ken tenesdene (Kenstone) to Hodnet. On February 20, 1325, Roger, son of Ralph de Hopton, with Alice his wife, had a life-lease from the Abbey of a messuage and half-virgate in Hopton.

About the year 1350 (as I suppose), Thomas, son of Thomas Tuder of Hopton, gives to Haghmon Abbey all his lands iu Hopton, with an acre of pasture, and with all escheats, &c, in Hopton and Esp ley, as enumerated in a Grant from Master John, late Lord of Espley, to William Tuder, the present Grantor's Grandfather.1 Witnesses, Sir William le Botiler, Lord of Weme ; Sir Robert Corbet ; Sir Laurence de Ludlow ; Sir John his son, knights ; John de Leghton ; Philip de Peynton ; and Walter Cresset.

I cannot divest myself of the idea that Hamo Peverel estab lished himself in Richard's position, as Lord of High Hatton. This would be in the generation after Domesday, and in the time of Henry I. My reasons for this suggestion are, first, because I find symptoms of a Seigneury having been asserted over High Hatton by one at least of Hamo Peverel' s heirs,3 and, secondly, because the fee-simple of High Hatton eventually went to Alan de Hadley, eldest son of Seburga, Hamo Peverel's natural daughter. Now I have suggested that the Muntator' s-fee which Alan de Hadley held under Fitz Alan in 1165, was not inclusive of High Hatton, but was relative to Hadley only.4 The inquiry therefore arises as to who held High Hatton at that period : and I presume that Richard de Hidesland, also a tenant of a Muntator' s-fee under Fitz-Alan, was the person in question.5 It is all but certain that a place, called Hidesland, constituted a part of the Manor of High Hatton, and that the person, called Richard de Hidesland in the Liber Niger, was the person elsewhere called Richard de Linley. I refer to previous notices of a Richard de Linley, living in the time of Henry I. and Stephen, and attesting Charters of Hamo Pe verel,6 also to previous notices of a Richard de Linley, living in the time of Henry IL, and attesting Charters of Hamo Peverel's Coheirs, aud having estates at Linley and Brockton.7 The last Richard, if there were two in succession, was living in 1180, and was succeeded 1 Domesday, fo. 254, a, 2. due, and had respect to Corbet's tenure at High Hatton. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 268, 351. 3 Vide supra, page 73, where Gilbert Peche conveys to Robert Burnel \"the homage and service of Thomas Corbet of Hadley.\" I cannot suppose that the thing conveyed was of a substantive na ture, but still it was perhaps an alleged 4 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 354. 5 Liber Niger, I. 143. 6 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 39, 40 ; Vol. III. p. 285 ; Vol. VIII. p. 128, bis. ?

It remains that I should give proof that this Richard de Linley was the Richard de Hidesland of the Liber Niger. The following Charter, which must needs have passed about the year 1179, is such a proof. \u2014 Ricardus de Linley a omnibus Sanct\u00e6 Dei Ecclesi\u00e6 filiis, tarn pre sentibus quam futuris, salutem.

Valete. Hugus donacionis testes sunt Wydo Extraneus ; Marscotus ; Petrus de Morton, et Philippus filius ejus ; Walterus de Huggeford ,- Wydo filius Roberti de Saesburid? The question which next occurs is the only difficult one in the case before us. If Richard de Linley's heir at Linley and Brockton was Philip de Linley, how is it that he was succeeded at High Hatton and Hidesland by Alan de Hadley? There are several ways in which this might have supposably happened,3 but, having no evi dence as to the mode, I will proceed to show the fact. \u2014 Alan de Hadley was certainly in his time Lord of High Hatton. He married Alice Pantulf, who (being mother of his daughter and sole heir Cecilia) survived him, and had her dower in High Hatton. This proves Alan de Hadley's sometime seizin. When Alice Pantulf died, her daughter Cecilia succeeded to High Hatton. It was in Cecilia's right that her second husband, Bald win de Hodnet, was seized of High Hatton, when he suffered his second forfeiture for rebellion against King John. This forfeiture commenced in 1215 and lasted till November 1217.3 During the interval, William de Stanton had possessed himself of High Hatton, but was ejected by Baldwin de Hodnet, as soon as the latter ob tained his pardon. At the Assizes of 1221, William de Staundon sued Baldwin de Hodnet and Cecilia his wife, for novel disseizin, \" they having ejected him from his tenement in Hatton.\" Baldwin appeared and produced the King's Writ ordering his restoration to 1 Harl. MS. 446, Quatern. xii. fo. 11. without issue. In that case, any estate derived from his mother would pass to his mother's heir, while his paternal inhe ritance would go to his own collateral heir. 3 Suppose, for instance, that Richard de Linley (I.) was second husband of Seburga Peverel, and father by her of an only son, Richard de Linley (II.). Then suppose that Richard de Linley (II.) died 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 55. 37 a IX."], [328, "290 HIGH HATTON. all his lands, and in particular, \" to the dower, late Alice Pantulfs, whose daughter aud heir, Cecily, was Baldwin's wife.\" Under this Writ he had seizin of Hatton. William de Staundon denied nothing of this statement, but said that Baldwin's reseizin was unjust, for he (the Plaintiff) was in seizin during the time of war. The sentence given was full against the Plaintiff. His Surety was Richard de Leeton.1 On the death of Baldwin de Hodnet, in January 1225, his step son, Thomas Corbet, already Lord of Tasley, succeeded to his late Mother's estates at Hadley, High Hatton, and Bromley Regis. Of Thomas Corbet and his descendants I have said much under Tasley and Hadley.2 In 1230, Thomas Corbet sued Bishop Stavensby at Westminster for impleading him in Court-Christian about some question of common in Bromley Regis, and for excommunicating him. The Justices could give him no redress, but told him to get absolution ; for the Bishop came forward and proved that the alleged prosecution in Court- Christian was a figment of Corbet's, and that the real ground of his excommunication was a violent assault com mitted by him on a Clerk. A Writ-Close of September 25, 1238, when the King was at Shrewsbury, orders the election of a Coroner, in room of Thomas Corbet of Hethleg (Hadley), who had apparently resigned. In 1240, the tenures of Thomas Corbet of Tasley are put at one knight's-fee in Hatton and Hadley, and half a fee in Tasley,3 but I doubt whether his collective tenure was more than a whole knight's fee.4 On November 18, 1240, that Fine was levied at Salop, which proves that the claim of the Stantons to Hatton was recurrent and not wholly groundless. It cost \" Thomas Corbet of Tasseley\" 35 merks to compound the Suit of Grand Assize, under which Stephen de Stanton impleaded him for the Manor of Hatton. The Hundred-roll of 1255 gives Hatton as a Manor of one hide, and subject to the proportionable payment of 4d. for motfee, and 4c?. for stretward. Roger Corbet, Lord of the Vill, held it of the Fief of John fitz Alan, and provided a horseman, with horse, hauberk, lance, and chapel-de-fer, to serve at Fitz Alan's Castle of Oswestry, for 40 days, and at Corbet's cost. The Manor did suit to the Hundred, twice yearly, at the She riff's Tourns, but not to the lesser Hundred-Courts.5 1 Assizes, 6 Hen.

Sir Roger had so raised the stank of his Vivary near Espris (the Express-wood marks the spot) in the vill of Heghehatton sur-Hyneheth, as that the water ofthe said vivary inundated a good part of the Abbot's land at Hideslond Grange.1 In September 1456, Abbot Richard of Haghmon gives a 60 years' lease of his land at Hidesland-juxta-Coldehatton, to John Mille of Hatton, Joan his wife, WilHam Felton of Hatton, and Alice his wife, at a rent of 25s.2 \u2014 This description of Hidesland, as near Cold Hatton, is at first sight puzzling, but a glance at the Map will show that the spot in which our former argument would place the vill, would be not very far from Cold Hatton.

I refer to former pages for an estimate of the probability that the Ricardus of Domesday was Ancestor of the Stantons.1 If so, I think that Ricardus's real name was Richard fitz Halufri, for cer tainly there was an ancestor of the Stantons whose name is vari ously written as Halufer, Halwred, Hellunric, Chaleuric, and Alured. Then there is a probability that one Hunald was father of the three brothers of Henry II.'s time, two of whom, Robert and Richard, were called by the generic name, Fitz Halufri, while the third, Roger, was called by the patronymic, Fitz Hunald. Of Richard fitz Halufri, the presumed second brother, I have a word more to say here. As Richard fitz Haluri, we have seen him with apparently a mesne interest in Hopton, about 1155-60.2 Per haps it was he who was living in 1191, and who as Richard fitz Aluric was debited with one merk as Surety for oue Richard Sad doch junior and his brothers. Perhaps too it was he who as Richard de Stanton, was remembered in the next century to have given some land in Stanton to the Knights Templars, domiciled at Keel (in Staf fordshire) . Of Robert fitz Halufri, the elder brother of Richard, I have given particulars elsewhere, and also of his presumed son and heir, Ste phen, as occurring in 1177, 119.2, and 1199.3 The following notes further relate to the latter person, whom we may call \u2014 Stephen de Stanton (I.). At the Assizes of 1203, Stephen de Stanton appears as Security for a Litigant and as himself amerced 20s. for some trespass. In 1212, he seems to have been in the fol lowing of John le Strange, for a Writ-Close of May 31, 1213, ac knowledges that John le Strange, junior, and Stephen de Stanton, had on June 10, 1212, paid \u00a3QQ to the King, then at Kingshaugh, for John le Strange, Senior.4 But the most extraordinary feature in the history of this Stephen and his family, is that he contested a right to the Honour of Mont gomery with Thomas de Erdinton. This opens up a great genealo gical problem of which I shall have more to say elsewhere. Suffice it here to state that Stephen de Stanton, with Robert his son and heir, allowed the superiority of Erdinton's claim, and that King John, in January 1215, ratified the said agreement, and bestowed the said Honour on Erdinton, saving the right of any third claim- ant.5 1 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 268, 351. 2 Supra, page 283.

I think that both Stephen de Stanton and his eldest son, Robert, were deceased before the Assizes of November 1221. Robert died without issue, so that his next brother, \u2014 William de Stanton, succeeded to his inheritance. I have noticed under Haughton the circumstances which probably ac companied Robert de Stanton's decease.1 I have further shown under High Hatton, that William de Stanton was a Royalist, and a man of note, in the lifetime of his elder brother, if not of their father. At the Assizes of 1221, William de Stanton, though defeated in respect of his claim on High Hatton, sat as one of those knightly Jurors who tried causes of Grand Assize. He was doubtless at this time Lord of Stanton. In 1223, I find him attesting Henry de Audley's foundation -charter of Hilton Abbey,2 and, in other Charters of that and subsequent years, his name as a witness is conspicuous. In 1231, he stood Surety for an amercement set upon Peter de Eyton. His grants to Haughmond Abbey relative to Stanton Church will appear elsewhere, but it is clear that one, if not both, of them passed between the years 1232 and 1235. The latest proved period of William de Stanton's life, is April 1236. Stephen de Stanton (II.), his heir, and probably his son, ap pears in the Feodaries of 1240-1, as Lord of the Fee of Stanton, that is, as holding two knights'-fees under Fitz Alan in Stanton, Roden, Preston Boats,3 and I may add Rodenhurst and Acton Rey nald. Before the year 1255 Stephen de Stanton (II.) was dead. His son and heir, \u2014 Stephen de Stanton (III.) was then a Minor, and his ward ship had been given or sold by Fitz Alan to that Thomas de Lee of whom I have spoken so often. Hence the Hundred-Roll of 1255, putting Stanton as a Manor of half a hide, says that it was held of the Fee of John Fitz Alan, that Stephen fitz Stephen, a minor, was Lord of the Vill, and that the wardship of the said minor had been given to Thomas de Le. The Manor paid 2d. stretward and 2d. motfee yearly, and did suit every three weeks to the Hundred. Ri chard de Stanton gave half a virgate to the Templars of Kil, but the Jurors knew not the manner of the gift. The Lord of Stanton did the ward of one knight for 40 days at Fitz Alan's Castle of Oswestry, at his own cost.4 1 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 286. 2 Monasticon, Vol. V. p. 716. 3 Testa de Nevill, pp. 4A, 47, 49. *- Rot.

I have only one indication that Stephen de Stanton, the minor of 1255, attained to the enjoyment of his estates. He made a grant of a messuage and carucate in Stanton to one Eva de Sou batch (now Sowbatch), a grant which, in 1318, was contested by Petronilla, daughter and heir of the Grantor. The next Lord of Stanton, after Stephen de Stanton (III.), was- - John de Erkalewe, of whom the Feodaries of 1284-5 speak as follows. \u2014 \" John de Erkalewe holds the vills of Preston, Stanton, Roden, and Rodenhurst, of Richard fitz Alan for two knights'-fees, and he (Fitz Alan) holds of the King in capite.\" It is difficult to say who this John de Erkalowe was. He cer tainly was not Lord of Child's Ercall, aud John, Lord of High Ercall, was recently deceased. I take him to have been a younger son of the said John, and to have obtained Stanton, &c., by marry ing Petronilla, the daughter and heiress of Stephen de Stanton (III.) . The probability of this is increased by observing that thus John de Erkalowe's marriage would be nearly cotemporary with that of his elder brother.1 Again, if Petronilla de Stanton's father was a Minor in 1255, it is probable that she herself was little more than an infant in 1284. We are not therefore surprised to find that her supposed marriage with John de Erkalowe was unpro ductive of issue. It is certain that in 1288 Petronilla was the wife of\u2014 Thomas de Lee, and that her eventual heirs were her children by the said Thomas. I have alluded to this marriage before ; and sup posed Thomas de Lee to have been a younger son of Thomas de Lee above mentioned.2 From this time the genealogy of the Lees of Stanton, Roden, &c., becomes very clear, as will be seen by the foregoing pedigree. The following illustrative particulars are not capable of such compression. \u2014 By a Deed, without date, Thomas du Lee, Lord of Staunton, gives, to Richard de Boley, land in Staunton. By another undated Deed, Thomas du Lee, Lord of Stanton, and his wife Petronilla, give to Thomas du Lee, their son, a messuage in the vill of Stanton, with remainder, on Thomas's death without heirs, to Stephen his brother, with remainder, on Stephen's death without heirs, to Philip du Lee and his heirs.3 This provision for a younger son was followed in 1310-11 by a settlement of the Manors of Stanton and Preston, on John, the \u00bb Vide supra, p. 87. 2 Supra, Vol. VJL-p^O. 3 Harl.

(1311-12) Thomas de Lee and Petronilla his wife give to John de Lee and to Matilda, daughter of Henry de Erdinton, all their land, whether sown or unsown, in Roden.\" A Fine of April 16, 1312, further explains this Deed.\u2014 Thomas de Lee and Petronilla his wife, Deforciants of the Manor of Rodene, the right of Petronilla, settle the same on John de Lee, and his wife, Matilda, daughter of Henry de Erdinton, &c. (as in the entail stated under Roden) .** I take it that John de Lee, thus married, came of age about this period. We have Thomas de Lee attesting a Rodington Deed on March 25, 1313. In August of the same year I find Thomas de Lee and his sons, John and Stephen, concerned in a suit which I will give under Shavington. In the Nomina Villarum of March 1316, Tho mas de Leye is duly returned as Lord of Staunton.2 I do not find him in any instance named as a Knight. He died in 1316 or 1317; for in January 1318, \" Petronilla, widow of Thomas de la Lee, and daughter and heir of Stephen de Stanton, was found to have dis seized John, son of Reyner de Lee, of a messuage and carucate in Stanton.\"3 By a Fine, levied April 22, 1319, it would almost seem that Petronilla's son, John, having obtained Stanton under the Deed of 1310-11, had alienated it to John Corbet of Preston, and that Petronilla was now obliged to repurchase it for 100 merks. The Fine is between Robert de Acton, Attorney of Petronilla, widow of Thomas de Lee (Plaintiff), and the said John Corbet, Deforciant, of the Manor of Staunton super Hyneheth, whereof was Suit-at law. John Corbet surrendered it to Petronilla, to hold for life of the Lords of the fee, with remainder to her son John and his bodily 1 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 270, 387. 5 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 397.

The way the estate had come to John son of Reyner de Lee appears to have been this. \u2014 From Reyner de Lee, whom I beUeve to have been a younger brother of Sir John (of Berrington) and of Thomas (of Stanton) the estate descended to John son of Reyner. But Sir John, his Uncle, seems to have had some claim thereto, for in 4 Edw. II. (1310-11) \"John du Lee, Knight, releases to John son of Reyner de Lee all right in Southbache.

For this Petronilla paid John Corbet 100 merks. Petronilla de Lee was still living in 6 Edw. III. (1332) ; for, in a Subsidy-Roll of that year, she is one of those assessed under Staunton. Her quota was 3s. ; that of Robert Fraunce, 3s. 4ci. John de Lee, son and heir of Thomas and Petronilla, was mar ried, as we have seen, in 1312, and thereupon had Roden. In December 1311 he had attested an Ercall Deed as John, son of Thomas du Lee. In January 1312 he attests after his Father.1 In March 1316 and October 1318 he attests other Deeds as Johu de la Lee of Roden. Other attestations of his in December 1318 and March 1320 show that he was not as yet a knight. In 15 Edw. II. (1321-2) we have him still styling himself Johu, son of Thomas de Lee. Two Writs of March and May 1322 address him as John de la Lee, and as a Commissioner of Array for Shropshire. He was returned as a Knight of the Shire, for the same County, to the Parliament which met at York in November 1 322 ;2 and in May 1324 he was summoned to attend a Great Council at Westminster.3 In 19 Edw. II. (1325-6) John de Lee, knight, son and heir of Thomas de Lee, gives to Stephen his brother, and to Thomas de Lee, brother of the said Stephen, for their lives, a parcel of arable land in the field of Southbache. In 1 Edw. III. (1327-8) I still find this Sir John styled \" Lord of Roden.\" His grant in the same year to his daughter Maud has been already given under Berrington.4 A Subsidy, levied in Roden during the same year, charges 15rf. on John de Lee, lbd. on Alan de Roden, and 14-i. on Thomas fitz John. The descendants of John de Lee continued to be styled rather \"of Roden\" than \"of Stanton,\" till the marriage of his Great grandson, Robert, with the heiress of Lee of Langley. After that, they were rather styled \" of Langley.\" Further particulars of this, the greatest, though not the eldest, branch of the Lees, have been given under Berrington.5 I have something to say now about those other members of this family who acquired tenements in Stanton or in Sowbatch. And first I will speak of \u2014 ber 1323 (supra, Vol. VII. p. 40) he is styled Chivaler. 1 Supra, page 93. s It is noticeable that this return to Parliament exactly marks the period at which John de Lee first assumed the style of a Knight.

Reyner de Lee, younger son of that Sir Thomas de Lee who had custody ofthe Fee of Stanton, in 1255. By Deed, without date, Thomas de Lee, knight, gave to his son Reyner the whole vill of La Lee subtus Pebenhul? The Lee, near Pimhill, probably the oldest estate of the Lees, thus passed to a younger son. Sir Thomas de Lee, knight, is also said to have given to his son Reiner and his heirs, 6 messuages, one carucate, and three virgates in Hadnall. This gift was erroneously attributed to the \u00e6ra of Edward I., instead of Henry III., in whose reign alone can such a grant have been made. The premises passed by some means or other to Haughmond Abbey, but in 1408 Petronilla, Great-great-great-granddaughter of Reyner, joined with her hus band, Robert de Lee of Roden, in an attempt to recover them. They failed, on the ground that Sir Thomas de Lee's grant to Rey ner was not such an entail as they wished to make out.2 The mode in which Reyner de Lee acquired (about 1270-90) an estate in Sowbatch has been already pointed out in a note.3 I shall show, under Lea-near-Pimhill, that Reyner de Lee was living in 1292 and 1294. At his death he left an infant son, John, and a widow Johanna. The son's Guardian assigned for the widow's dower, a messuage, a carucate, and 4 acres of meadow, and other land, in Stanton {i. e. in Sowbatch) . John, son of Reyner de Lee, appears to have been of age be fore June 1307, when he had a suit with Haughmond Abbey and William Banastre concerning property in Hadnall. In 1310-11 he obtained a quitclaim from Sir John (his Uncle) as to his estate in Sowbatch. On Sept. 24, 1317, he attests a Charter of the same Sir John, dated at Berrington, and relating to lands claimed by Haughmond Abbey in Hadnall. In January 1318, he regained his estate in Stanton {i. e. in Sowbatch) against Petronilla, Lady of Stanton, who had disseized him thereof. A Charter of his, bearing date 11 Edw. II. (1317-8) and attested by John,4 son of Stephen de Lee, is quoted among the Lee Muniments. In 9 Edward III.

Petronilla, daughter and sole heir of the said Roger and Joanna, married her distant Cousin Robert Lee of Roden, and thus reunited two branches of this family, as before alluded to. Stephen de Lee, a younger son of Thomas and Petronilla, has already been mentioned under dates of 1310-11, 1313, and 1325-6. His interests in Stanton and Sowbatch were contingent, or only for life. His name will recur under Astley in 1337 and 1357. Of his daughter, Catherine, I have spoken under Preston Boats.3 Thomas de Lee, another of the younger sons of Thomas and Petronilla, has also occurred above, in 1310-11 and in 1325-6. ln 1340 John de Clynton and Alice his wife failed to prosecute their suit against Thomas de Lee of Roden, Kenewric ap David, Ro bert de Byriton, and Oliver de Lee, for disseizing them of a tenement in Burton juxta Pychford. The suit was renewed in 1342 against the same parties, together with Walter, son of Walter de Burton. In March 1345, Thomas, son of Thomas de Lee of Stanton-super- Hyneheth, having been enfeoffed by Richard, son of Thomas Dod of Hyghe-Hatton-super-Hyneheth, in a messuage and carucate in Hat ton, the two were sued by John, Parson of Walters Upton, for dis seizing him ofthe premises. In the next year (1346), the Plaintiff did not appear in this suit, and was pronounced in misericordid. In 23 Edw. III. (1349) John, son of William de Tittenleye, re leases his right in all lands, &c. to Thomas, son of Thomas de Lee.4 From a Fine of the year 1353, recorded in 1359, it appears that Agnes, then wife of \" Thomas, son of Thomas de Lee of Stanton,\" was heiress in reversion of the Manor of Hadnall.

Thomas de Lee and Agnes now settle the whole of Agnes' reversionary interest on William Banastre of Yor ton, Alianore his wife, and their bodily heirs, with remainder to the right heirs of the said William Banastre. Thomas de Lee is party, as trustee, to two Moreton- Corbet Fines in 1363 and 1371. In the last instance he is styled \"of Soubatch.\" Thomas de Lee must have lived to a great age, but died without issue, before the year 1384, as we have seen under Preston.1 From his ubiquitous appearances I think it possible that he may have been that \"Thomas, son of Thomas de la Lee,\" whom I have noticed under Berrington and Eaton Mascott, as occurring in 1333 and 1335.2 Oliver de Lee, another son of Thomas and Petronilla, had Pres ton-Boats by gift of his mother. He occurs in 1318, and if what I have surmised under Berrington as to his elder brother John, be correct, he had Okehurst, a member of Stanton, and was deceased in 1322- 3.3 We know that he died without issue. Of other Undertenants, I must name one Robert de Stanton, whose first appearance is in 1255. In 1260 he fined half a merk ut amittatur per ballivam ; \u2014 that he might be released from prison on finding Sureties for his reappearance. His crime was probably that of taking a deer in company with Alan de Parva Buildwas. He duly appeared to take his trial at the Forest Assizes of 1262. From 1270 to 1281 this Robert de Stanton occurs constantly as a Witness of Deeds. At the Assizes of 1272 he was one of the Jurors for Brad ford Hundred, and he appears on other Juries of 1277, 1278, and 1281. John de Stanton, is so called in 1298, but occurs as John, son of Robert de Staunton, when attesting a Rodington Deed in 1313.4 He was perhaps son ofthe above Robert. CHURCH OF ST. ANDREW AT STANTON. The mention of a Church and a Priest in the Domesday Manor of Stanton, indicates the pre-existence of one of those Saxon Foun dations whose Parishes appear so vast to modern ideas. Of the extent of Stanton Parish I can only say that it included High Hatton and Lee Brockhurst, at each of which places Churches or Chapels have since been founded. 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 271. 3 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 40. 4 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 379. 1 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 41, 105, 106."], [343, "THE CHURCH. 303 The history of the Mother Church, with which I now proceed, is very full and curious, explaining many points of ancient usage, by supplying the ratio, as well as the mere facts, of procedure, in the conveyance and appropriation of a great Rectory. The Advowson was in the Stantons, the Lords of the Fee, till the \u00e6ra of William de Stanton, who held the Manor from 1221 to 1236. During his tenure \" the See of Chester was vacant,\" and we know that the only vacancy, which can be thus alluded to, was that which commenced August 20, 1223, on the death of Bishop Cornhull, and lasted till April 14, 1224, when Bishop Stavensby was consecrated. \u2014 During the said vacancy Richard de Chirbiri (Chirbury), Parson of Stanton, attended an Archidiaconal Synod or assembly ; and tendered the resignation of his benefice to \" Master Alexander \" (the famous Alexander de Swereford), \" then Archdeacon of Salop.\" On the nomination of William de Stanton, the Archdeacon forthwith \" admitted and instituted \" one Hugh de Stanton to the Living, such being the Archdeacon's duty under the circumstances of the vacancy of the See. It would seem that Richard de Chirbury afterwards repented of his resignation, and, taking advantage of its having been only made to an Archdeacon, held the Church, or assumed to hold it, till his death, which took place in Midlent 1236.1 Meanwhile (that is, certainly between the years 1224 and 1235, and probably about the year 1230 2) \"William de Staunton gave to Haughmond Abbey the Advowson {jus pratronatus) of the Church of Staunton, adding to the gift a messuage and three acres of land in his lay-fee, which were held by Hugh Dod.\" Bartholomew Thoret (who was deceased in 1235), and Hugh Forester, attested this grant.3 In Midlent 1236, Richard de Chirbury died, and the Abbot of Haughmond assuming himself to be Patron of the Living, was re sisted by William de Stanton. The Abbot sued the Knight in the Courts of Westminster, in April following, to compel him to permit the Abbot to present \" a fit Parson.\" William de Staunton (appa rently repentant of his grant of the Advowson, and mindful only of 1 Placita, Pasch.Tm. 20 Hen.

The Abbot rejoined by stating that \" Richard, the latest Parson, had died at Midlent 1236, and that the Living was as yet a Sequestration in the hand of the Bishop (Stavensby).\" The Court made a reference to the said Bishop, and adjourned the Cause till July 1, when his evidence was to be forthcoming. Nicholas de London, a Canon of Haughmond, was named as the Abbot's Attorney, but the Rolls which are wanted to complete the secular treatment of the Cause, are lost. I have good reason to think that Bishop Stavensby compromised this dispute by allowing Hugh de Stanton to remain Rector of Stan ton, but at the same time by obliging him and his Patron, Sir William, to give a formal security to the Abbey for the future exer cise of its right of Patronage. At all events we have a Deed, whereby \" Alexander, Bishop of Coventry, at the donation and concession of Sir William de Stanton, gives and concedes to Haghmon Abbey 4 shillings out of the Church of Stanton, in the name of a perpetual benefice. Witnesses, Master Reginald de Cleidon, then Official (of the Bishop), Master Symon Perduz ; Thomas de L'Ewe; A., Vicar of Ercalwe ; R., Vicar of Lilleshull ; Heco de Atyngham, and others.\"2 This Deed probably passed in 1236, but certainly between 1236 and 1238, when Bishop Alexander died. I next find a triplicate copy of a Deed dated at Stanton on the day of St. Bricius, Bishop and Confessor {i. e. November 13), and in the year 1247, according to one Copy, but in the year 1267, ac cording to two Copies.3 The earlier date is probably correct, but the discrepancy does not affect the current of our narrative. The Deed, whatever its date, proves that \" Hugh \" was still \" Rector of Staunton,\" that he disputed the Abbot of Haghmon's right to a pension of 4s. out of Stanton Church, that the question was settled before the \" Dean of Christianity (the Rural Dean) of Salop,\" and that the Abbot's right thereto was established in \" full Chapter \" and acknowledged by the said Hugh. 1 This corrects the Ust of the Arch deacons of Salop, which should make Swereford continuously Archdeacon from 1222 to 1236 (Hardy's Le Neve, Vol. I. \u2022> Harl. MS. 3868, fo. 9.\u2014 Cleidon be came Stavenby's Official after July 1232. He occurs as such in July 1234. 3 Harl.

It next appears that \" a Rector of Stanton died while Alan was Abbot of Haghmon, and that the said Alan presented his successor.\" This death and presentation must have occurred between 1258 and 1277, taking the widest intervals for Abbot Alan's tenure of office. Probably the Rector who died was Hugh de Stanton. Abbot Alan's Presentee, whatever his name, was deceased in 1288, for then Thomas de Lee and his wife Petronilla, on the one hand, and the Abbot of Haghmon on the other, were again contesting the right of presentation to the vacancy. A Writ of King Edward I., dated October 18, 1288, orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to take security from the Abbot for the prose cution of his claim, and then to empanel twelve free and lawful men, of the Vicinage of Stanton-in-Hyneheth, to appear before the Justices at Westminster, on November 18 following, and try the question in the usual form, viz. Quis advocatus, tempore pads, pre sentavit ultimam personam, &c. The result of this Trial, threatened or held, may be inferred from two memoranda, the first of which shows that Thomas and Petro nilla de Lee, in the presence of John de Drayton, Abbot of Shrews bury, recognized the Abbot of Haghmon's right to the Advowson, and agreed to levy a Fine in the King's Court before May 19, 1289, securing the said Advowson to the Abbot, who paid ,\u00a320 for the concession. The second memorandum is Thomas de Lee's own letter to R., Bishop of Coventry, dated January 1 5, 1289, and withdrawing a pre sentation which he had already made to the vacant benefice. Lee seals his letter with the Abbot of Shrewsbury's seal, as well as his own, \"which was perhaps unknown to the Bishop {forte vobis in cognito) .\" Now follows another Writ-Royal, dated January 28, 1289, and which orders the Sheriff to enjoin Thomas and Petronilla de Lee to give warranty to the Abbot, of a messuage, 3 acres of land, and the Advowson of Stanton Church, which the Abbot held under them, as he averred, and whereof he had their Charter. If the said Thomas and Petronilla refused to obey, the Sheriff was to cite them to West minster. Next we have a piece of official routine. \u2014 The King's Justices at Westminster would not allow the covenanted Fine to be levied \" because of the statute which forbade Advowsons of Churches to be placed in mortmain.\" Gilbert, Abbot of Haughmond, here upon memorialized the King as to the Justices' refusal, and obtained a Writ ordering them to allow the Fine to be levied, and setting forth ix. 39"], [346, "306 STANTON UPON HINEHEATH. how \" William de Stanton had enfeoffed John de Morton, a former Abbot, in the Advowson,\" and how \" the Parson, last deceased, had been presented by Abbot Alan.\" These considerations, I presume, were given, to show that the case did not fall under the Statute of Mortmain, which was not retrospective. \u2014 The Justices complied at once, and we have the consequent Fine, levied at Westminster on June 12, 1289. Thomas de Lee and Petronilla his wife (Impedients) acknowledge the perpetual right of Gilbert, Abbot of Haghmon (Plaintiff) to a messuage, 3 acres of land, and the Advowson of the Church of Staunton-super-Hyneheth, whereof was Plea of Charter-warranty. The Abbot in return re ceived the Recognizors to the benefit of the prayers, &c. of his House, for ever. \" And,\" adds the Record, \" this Concord was made by precept of the King.\" An entry in the Haughmond Chartulary announces that on the 13th of July, Mcclxixix {sic), William de Hopton, Subdeacon, was instituted Rector of Stanton by Roger Bishop of Coventry, at the presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Haghmon. The 32nd year of the Bishop's Consecration (also assigned as the date of this act) would place it in 1288, while the dominical year intended to be given was probably Mcclxxxix. Neither date is consistent with a Writ of King Edward I., dated January 24, 1290, and addressed to the same Bishop, which orders him to admit the Abbot of Hagh mon's Presentee. We may however safely conclude that William de Hopton was admitted as Rector within a year of the Fine of 1289. The Taxation of 1291, values the Church of Staunton (in the Deanery of Salop) at \u00a312 per annum; besides a pension of 4*. which the Abbot of Haumon derived therefrom.1 The next step for the Canons of Haughmond was to get an appro priation of this Rectory. By a Patent of March 6, 1327, King Edward III., as far as in him lay, allowed this Appropriation, as well as that of a third part of the Church of Wroxeter, notwithstand ing the Statute of Mortmain.2 A Bull of Pope John (XXII.) dated at Avignon, September 16, 13.29, allows the Appropriation ofthe Church of St. Andrew of Stanton-super-Hynehet (whose fruits, ac cording to the Taxation, did not exceed \u00a312), on the death of the existing Rector.\" On March 30, 1330, the Archdeacon of Salop, as Commissary for the Bishop, settled other preliminaries of the proposed annexation at a meeting held in the Collegiate Church of 1 Pope Nich.

But the consent of the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield had yet to be obtained. \u2014 On July 16, 1330, the Abbot binds himself in a bond of \u00a320, payable to the Dean and Chapter in 1333, or else to secure to the Dean and Chapter an annual pension of one merk from Stanton Church, payable from and after the death of Rector William. On the next day (July 17, 138*0) the Dean and Chapter demand and agree to receive the said pensiou. Their manifesto describes the nature of their right to such compensation. It arose by their in sisting on what may be called the fraction of a contingency. If Stanton remained a Rectory, and if, on any vacancy thereof, the Patron neglected to present, two-thirds of the fruits of the Living would devolve to the Bishop during the period of vacancy. This was an ancient right of the See of Lichfield, both with respect to Stanton and other Churches in that district. Further, any con tinued neglect of the Patron to present, would entitle the Bishop to collate. Again, if the Bishop neglected so to collate within the statutory period, the presentation would devolve on the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield. \" All these possibilities,\" continues the mani festo, \" would be extinguished by appropriation ;\" but the Chapter agreed thereto, for the stipulated pension. On April 1, 1331, Bishop Northburgh recites and confirms his Commissary's proceedings at the meeting held March 30, 1330, in St. Chad's Church. Ou April 3, 1331, it was agreed at Haugh mond Abbey, that the Abbot should pay the Bishop a pension of 2 merks yearly, for his consent to the appropriation of the Churches of Ruyton and Stanton. This was the estimated value of the Bishop's contingent rights in cases of vacancy, as already set forth in the manifesto of the Dean and Chapter. On October 16, 1331, Bishop Northburgh recites the previous acts of appropriation, and announces the resignation of Sir William de Hopton, late Rector of Stanton. The Bishop also approves of a plan propounded by the Abbot, ou October 1st previous, for the future Vicarage. The chief provisions were that the Abbot should retain the New-Hall with its granges and other buildings, and a messuage and barn, and all corn tithes, except of gardens, and one grange at Lee Brockhurst, and all wool-tithes, except those of Lee Brockhurst, and the hay-tithes of Stanton. The Vicar was to have the old Rectorial manse with its garden and dove-cot, a meadow, a virgate in Stanton, a messuage and half-virgate in Lee Brockhurst, the tithes of Mills, gardens,"], [348, "308 STANTON UPON HINEHEATH. milk, ducks, calves, lambs, flax, hemp, and honey {basi\u00e6 apium), all mortuaries, and all hay-tithes, except of Stanton. The Vicar was to pay a pension of Gs. 8d. to the Archdeacon of Salop, and 2*. for syno dals; and to serve Stanton Church and Lee-Brockhurst Chapel. On November 3, 1331, Bishop Northburgh instituted the first Vicar of Stanton, at presentation of the \" Abbot and Convent of Haghmon, Impropriators of the said Church by Papal authority, and Patrons thereof.\" It was not till February 6, 1357, that William the Dean (read Prior) and the Chapter of Coventry, discovering that they had similar rights with the Chapter of Lichfield, allowed the appropriation of the Churches of Stanton and Ruyton, for a pension of one merk, payable to themselves yearly. In 1311, the Assessors of the Ninth quoting a Taxation of \u00a312 on the Church of Staunton, assessed the Parish at \u00a38 only ; because a great part of the arable land in the Parish was Glebe ; and, though it increased the Church-Taxation, could not be taken to prove any such capabilities of the Parish in general, as were now to be taxed : indeed the Vicar, in whose hands the Glebe was, paid his tenths for the same, to the King, under another assessment.1 The Valor of 1534\u20145 gives the preferment of William Carbes', Vicar of Staunton, as worth \u00a36 per annum, less 9s. 2d., for Procu* rations and Synodals.2 The Abbot of Haughmond's Rectorial ferm was put at \u00a37. 10*. 2d. The Churches of Staunton, Hanmer (Flintshire), and Ruyton, were however charged with a collective pension of \u00a31. 16s. 8d. to the Bishop of Lichfield ; and the Churches of Stanton and Ruyton with two pensions, of a merk each, to the Dean of Lichfield aud the Prior of Coventry.2 Also the Abbot paid the Bishop \u00a31. 8s. lOd.

The Rectors of Stanton, all who occur, have been noticed in the foregoing narrative. The following Vicars were uniformly presented by the Abbot and Convent of Haughmond. \u2014 John Fayrchild, Chaplain, was admitted Nov. 3, 1331. Sir John de Brugh died August 11, 1349 (probably ofthe Pestilence) . William Godmon, Chaplain, was admitted Jan. 27, 1350. Sir John Knitte, Priest, was admitted Aug. 20, 1359. 1 Inquis.

Afterwards it was waste. Now it is worth 7s.\"2 This is the second Domesday Manor in which Alcher and Albert appear as Co-tenants of Rainald the Sheriff. At Middleton the Cotenancy of the Fitz-Aers and the Rossalls, the descendants of Alcher and of Albert, endured for ages. At Withyford the en durance of Rossall's tenure was not so long nor so clear, but still we have sufficient evidence of its existence to teach us that the smallest sentence of Domesday has a significance. FITZ AER'S MANOR. I have nothing to add to what I have said, under Middleton Scriven, Aston Eyre, and Harcott, relative to the descent of Alcheris representatives, till we come to the year 1165.

We next come to the suit about Withyford, which\u2014 Robert fitz Aer (II.) maintained against John le Strange during the earlier years of Richard I.'s reign. The preliminaries of this suit have already been shown.3 I now proceed with the details. \u2014 A Plea- Roll which I know from its internal evidence to belong to Trinity Term, 1194,3 has the following entry. The allusions thereof having been already explained, I here give the original in extenso. \u2014 Robertus filius Aeri petit versus Johannem Extraneum terram de Widiford ut jus suum et hereditatem suam, in quam Johannes intru sit se dum terra ilia et ali\u0153 terr\u00e6 su\u00e6 fuerunt in manu Domini Regis, et dum ipse suit in prisond Domini Regis pro morte cujusdam hominis, unde rettatus suit ; et /'supply dicit quod) sponte sud posuit se in prisond quousque liberatus suit per Justiciarios, et promisit Domino Regi x marcas pro recto habendo et seisind tali qualem ha buit die qua terr\u00e6 su\u00e6 saisit\u00e6 fuerunt in manu Regis pro predicto.

The point was never decided by judgment at Westminster or elsewhere; and it would be difficult to decide it now. The result was eventually at tained by Final Concord, which, as we shall see, made Le Strange Mesne-Lord of Withyford, and made Fitz Aer, not Fitz Alan's tenant there, but Le Strange's. On May 12, 1295 (if I rightly date another Plea- Roll), the fol- 1 \u25a0 2 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 200, 201. 3 It is not a Roll of King John's reign' ' as stated in the Abbreviate Placitorum (page 96)."], [351, "311 GREAT WITHYFORD. lowing step occurred in this suit. \u2014 Archiepiscopus warantizuvit Jo hanni Extraneo diem Lun\u00e6 post Ascensionem, quod (read quia) suit in servicio Domini Regis loco Radulfi Extranei qui infirmatur. Et dies datus est ei per hominem suum in octabis Sancti Johannis versus Robertum filium Raheri (read Aheri). The Archbishop, here mentioned, was the Viceroy, Hubert Walter. I understand him, in his double capacity of Viceroy and Justiciar, to have respited John le Strange's appearance in the above suit till July 1, 1195, because the said John now occupied the military po sition of his dying cousin, Ralph le Strange of Alveley, who had been engaged in the Welsh wars.1 It is further clear that Robert Fitz Aer (II.) died while this Suit was pending. I have elsewhere given the Fine, proffered by Emma de Sai his widow in 1198.2 This was merely to have custody of his land and heir, and freedom in respect of her own marriage. Having attained this object, the suit with John le Strange naturally de volved on the said Emma. Between Michaelmas 1198 and January 1199, Emma de Say proffered and paid to King Richard 30 merks, \" to have such seizin of the land of Wiford as Robert fitz Aier, her former husband, had on the day when that land was seized into the King's hand for the death of a certain man, whereof he (the said Robert) was accused.\"3 A Plea- Roll (which I think belongs to Hilary Term 1199) shows John le Strange resisting Emma de Say's claim. \u2014 \" By precept of Geoffrey fitz Piers (then Chief Justice) a day, in five weeks of Easter, is given to John le Strange and Emma de Sai, in a Plea of land.\"4 The Final Concord which closed this Suit, on Sept. 25, 1199, has been given in substance under Aston Eyre.

Thus did Robert fitz Aer (III.) repurchase a part of his inheri tance, viz. the actual possession of Withyford ; and thus did John le Strange (II.) obtain the mesne-lordship. William de Hadley's concern in the matter was probably by some Feoffment of Le Strange, during the period when the latter was in possession. About November 1200 I find another oblatum by Emma de Say, relative to a portion of Withyford, which she conceived to have been wrongfully occupied during the period of her late husband's and her own difficulties. \u2014 \" Emma de Say gives the King 40s. to have an Inquest as to whether Robert fitz Aer was seized of 40 acres in Wiford (now held by Vivian de Roshal and Hugh de Upton), on the day when he was disseized of his other lands by reason of his indictment for manslaughter, and as to whether the said Vivian and Hugh occupied the said land while the lands of Robert fitz Aer were in custody of John le Strange. The Sheriff was to report the result of this Inquest through two of the Jurors before January 20\" (1201). 1 The Pipe Rolls show this fine liquidated in 1202 and 1203, but I hear no more of the Inquest. Vivian de RoshalFs ap pearance in Fitz Aer's estate at Withyford is pertinent to a future subject. I have indicated, under Aston Eyre, that Robert fitz Aer (III.) died between 1221 and 1231. William, his successor, who occurs in 1231 and died in 1245, was Robert's brother. The following details are derived from an Inquest of 1248.2 \u2014 Robert fitz Aer be queathed {legavit) the Mill of Withyford to Haughmond Abbey : but, after Robert's death, his brother and heir, William, made entry on all his lands, and disallowing his bequest to Haughmond, assigned both the town and mill of Withyford as the dower of Amice, Ro bert's widow. The Abbot hereupon sued William for the Mill, but agreed to accept an annuity of 20s. in lieu thereof. (It should here be observed that when Philip le Bret fined in 1245 for custody of the infant heir of William fitz Aer he accepted the Abbot of Haughmond's annuity as a recognized charge thereon,3 though William fitz Aer died seized of nothing in Withyford.) To continue with the Inquest, \u2014 Amice, widow of Robert fitz Aer, seems to have died in 1247, seized of Withyford and its Mill. The 1 Oblata, p. 80. J Inquisitions, 32 Hen. III., No. 9. 3 Supra, Vol. I. p. 204."], [353, "GREAT WITHYFORD. 313 Abbot of Haughmond apparently thought this a good opportunity of entering on the Mill, but the Sheriff ousted him at once, and seized the Mill into the King's hand. The Abbot complained to the King. Hence a Writ of January 13, 121-8, inquires of the Sheriff why he had made this seizure of the Mill, \" held by the Ab bot,\" and orders him to ascertain by Inquest what right the Abbot had thereto, and whether he was enfeoffed therein, and if enfeoffed, then by whom and how long ago ? The return to this Writ has ap peared above. The Jurors added that the Abbot had never been enfeoffed. The Sheriff, for his part, explained, that he had seized the Mill in manu Regis, because William Honald the Escheator was dead, and there was no other Escheator, and because other lands of the heir of Withyford were in the King's hand. The Hundred-Roll of 1255, confuses Pantulfs and Fitz Alan's shares of Great Withyford, because Fitz Aer happened to be Tenant of both shares. Restoring a distinction, which is necessary to per spicuity, I here quote only that part of the entry which relates to the subject now in hand. \u2014 \" John fitz Cleri (read Aeri) is Lord of the Vill of Wythyford, and holds of the Fee of Knokyn ;' and it is n hides, and pays 8d. stretward and 8d. motfee yearly; and does due suit to County and Hundred, and is geldable. And he (John fitz Aer) does the service of one Muntor at his own cost, for 15 days at Knokyn.\"1 The two hides, thus supposed to constitute the whole hidage of Great Withyford, was short of the complement of the three Domes day Manors, by 2 hides. Part of this diminution is attributable to the alienation of the Rossall Manor (1 hide) to Haughmond Abbey. The rest of the decrease can only be attributed to the usual causes ; \u2014 the favour of the Crown or the neglect of its fiscal Officers to insist on a perpetual maintenance of the Domesday measurements. Again, John Fitz Aer was a Minor in 1255 ; \u2014 a fact omitted in the above Record. And lastly, though he is well said to hold of the Fee of Knokyn, that is of Le Strange of Knokyn, it should also have been stated that Le Strange held under Fitz Alan. In July 1260, John de Erkelaw (of High Ercall) sues John fitz Aer for disseizing him of common-pasture in Witheford. In July 1268 and July 1269, John fitz Aer was one of four Jus tices deputed to the delivery of Bridgnorth Gaol. In September 1272, being placed on a similar commission for the Gaols of Shrews bury and Bridgnorth, he is styled a knight, a dignity which I think 1 Rot. Hundred, II. 57. ix. 40 a"], [354, "314 GREAT WITHYFORD. he must have really attained some years before. In February 1283, he was appointed Assessor and Collector, in Shropshire, of the Tax of the thirtieth recently granted to the Crown. The Feodaries of 1284-5 agree that \" John fitz Aer holds the vill of Magna Wythiford with its members, viz. Mokelinton (Muckle ton) and half the vill of Edgebalden (Edgboulton) under John le Strange ;\" but when one Record adds that it was so held as a member of John le Strange's Manor of Ruton (Ruyton, near Bas church), and when both Records say that John le Strange held it in capite of the King, the expression whether it be referred to Ruy ton or Withyford is inaccurate. He held both Manors under Fitz Alan. In 1287, John fitz Aer was appointed one of the Conservators of the Peace in the County of Salop; and in 1290 was returned as a Knight of the Shire. At the Assizes of October 1292, John fitz Aer is named as one of the existing four Coroners of Shropshire and ready to give account for his period of office. The Writ of Diem clausit announcing his death, bears date on January 16, 1293. The Inquest, held at Shrewsbury on February 12 following, found {inter alia) that he had held Aston Eyres of the Earl of Arundel by ser vice of a Knight's-fee, returnable at Oswestry : and that he had held Wythyford of Sir John le Strange for half a fee. Hugh, son and heir of the deceased, was now 30 years of age.1 In July 1297, Hugh fitz Aer was returned as a holder of 20 librates of lands and rents, and was summoned as such to serve in foreign parts. A Fine\" levied January 20, 1306, I take to be a settlement on the marriage of the then eldest son of Hugh Fitz Aer. \u2014 \" Hugh le fitz Aer, Plaintiff, acknowledges a grant of a messuage and carucate, and 100s. rent in Criddon (Salop), and of \u00a310 rent in Farnbarewe (War wickshire), to Henry le Haleys, Deforciant (and Trustee probably), whereof had been Plea of convention. The said Henry settles the premises on Hugh for life, with remainder to William, Hugh's son, and to Cristina, daughter of John de Redmarleye, and the heirs of the said William by Cristina; and with further remainder to the right heirs of William, quit of the heirs of Hugh.\"2 An Inquest held in April 1311, found it to be non-injurious to the Crown if Hugh fitz Aer were to enfeoff one William Canne in a messuage and carucate at Harcott, and the said William were, in turn, to settle the same on Hugh fitz Aer and Alina his wife, and 1 Inquisitions, 21 Edw. I., No. 44. 3 Fines Divers. Com., 34 Edw. I."], [355, "315 GREAT WITHYFORD. their heirs. On this occasion Harcott was valued at 40s. per an num, while Hugh fitz Aer's other estate at Aston Eyre, and which still would be his in fee-simple, was estimated to yield 100s. per annum? We know that Hugh fitz Aer eventually settled the tenancy of Aston on a younger son, Hugh. I also find him securing portions to two other younger sons in Withyford. \u2014 As \" Hugh fitz Aer, Lord of Magna Witeford,\" he gives to John his son, a parcel of land and bosc, called Engeware, in his aforesaid fee of Witeford. If the Grantee die without heirs of his body, the gift is entailed on Margery, the Grantor's eldest daughter, sister of the Grantee.2 Hugh fitz Aer, by another Deed, grants a parcel of land, &c, to his son Henry.3 The King's Writ of Diem clausit on the death of Hugh fitz Aer bears date December 3, 1313. An Inquest, held at Shrewsbury on the 24th instant, speaks of the share of Withyford, now under notice, as half the Manor. The Seigneuries of both Fitz Alan and Le Strange are to be recognized in the statement that the deceased had held half Withyford of the Earl of Arundel, by service of half a knight's-fee, returnable at Ruyton Castle (which was Le Strange's). The value of the whole Manor, whether held under Fitz Alan, or Botyler of Wem, was \u00a314. 2s. 4d.per annum. Harcott was extended at 40s.; Whetenaston {i. e. Aston Eyre) at \u00a39. 17s. per annum. Thomas fitz Aer, son and heir of the deceased, was aged 17 years on February 2, 1313.3 I conclude therefore that William fitz Aer, presumed to have been eldest son of Hugh in 1306, had died without issue. We may now estimate the truth and significance of the return called the Nomina Villarum, which is of date March 1316. It gives Harcott and Criddon to Alina fitz Aer; \u2014 thus showing the pro posed settlement of 1311 in operation, but the Fine of 1306 as abortive. It gives Aston Eyre to Hugh, son of Hugh fitz Aer, doubtless according to some settlement, which however I cannot find to be in existence. Lastly, it gives Wythiford to Thomas fitz Aer; \u2014 in accordance with the Inquest of 1313.4 Thomas fitz Aer's tenure of his estate must have been very brief. Margery, his only child and heir, was born and baptized at Wis tanstow on April 4, 1314 ; \u2014 that is, when her father was little more than eighteen years of age. She had a long minority, but (not 1 Ad quod Damnum, 4 Edw. II. No. 49. I ** Inquisitions, 7 Edw. IL, No. 46. 2 Harl. MS. 1396, fo. 67. I 4 Parliamentary Writs, IV. p. 851."], [356, "316 GREAT WITHYFORD. knowing the date of her father's death) I am unable to state its precise duration. From a Writ of July 9, 1328, Ifind that Margery, daughter and heir of Thomas fitz Aer had petitioned the Crown for livery of her in heritance, which was then in custody ofthe King, and Roger de Mor timer,1 and William le Botiller of Wem. She asserted herself to be of full age, but an Inquest held at Wenlock on August 2, 1328, proved her, by concurrent, and very curious, evidence, to have been only fourteen on April 4 previous.2 I have shown, under Apley-Castle, that in the year previous to this Inquest, Alan de Cherlton of Apley had license to crenelate his mansion of Withyforde.3 \u2014 The difficulty of accounting for this seeming anachronism is not so great as I have hitherto thought. Alan de Cherlton (I.) had doubtless obtained custody of Withyford, from Roger de Mortimer, and had already affianced its infant heiress to his own younger son, Alan. I refer back to Apley, for a full account and proof of this marriage and the probable date of its consummation.4 On May 10, 1338, two Fines were levied, whereby Alan, son of Sir Alan de Cherleton, Knight, and Margery his wife, Plaintiffs, convey the Manors of Wheton Aston, Magna Withyford, and Haker cote (Harcott) to John de Wyke, Parson of Magna Gatesden, and to James de Morton, Parson of La Rode (evidently two trustees). The said Feoffees in return, settle the three estates on Alan (Junior) and Margery, and their bodily heirs ; \u2014 remainder to John,5 son of Sir Alan de Cherlton, knight, and the heirs of his body ; \u2014 remainder (in respect of Aston and Withyford only) to Thomas de Cherleton,5 brother of the said John, and the heirs of his body ; \u2014 remainder of all three estates to the right heirs of Margery.6 \u2014 1 Roger de Mortimer here represents his unfortunate victim, Edmund, Earl of Arundel. On the Earl's attainder, Mor timer had obtained a grant of his Shrop shire estates (Dugd, Raronage, I. 145). 6 It should be observed that Alan de Cherlton (I.) and Alan de Cherlton (II.) had each a brother John, and a brother Thomas. We must not therefore iden tify the John and Thomas of the above Fine with John de Cherlton of Powys and Thomas de Cherlton Bishop of Here ford. The two latter were Uncles of the two former. \u2014 This coincidence of names, added to another circumstance (noticed above, p. 55), has caused great confusion in the genealogical accounts of this family. 6 Pedes Finium, 12 Edw. III., Nos. 102, 103. The Earl we know from other authority had had custody of Aston Eyre and Wi thyford (supra, p. 57), during part of Margery fitz Aer's minority. The King's custody arose in respect of Harcott ; WiUiam le Botiller's in respect of a part of Great Withyford. 2 Inquisitions, 2 Edw. III., No. 63. 3 * * Supra, pages 55, 56."], [357, "GREAT WITHYFORD. 317 This entail seems grossly unjust, though its injustice never became effectual. The making John and Thomas de Cherleton, contingent reversioners in the estates of their Sister-in-Law, would, had she died childless, have disinherited her right heirs. Subsequent to this Fine, Alan de Cherlton (II.) demised all the above estates to his own Father, for life. The sequel has been given already,1 except some of the curious statements which were adduced at, and corroborated by, the Inquest of 1356. These related partly to the descent of the Fitz Aers, partly to the relative signeural rights of the Crown and the Earl of Arundel over the Fitz Aers. I give some extracts, with comments thereon.\u2014 \" Earl Roger (de Montgomery) died at Quatford ; the Jurors did not know on what day.\" (Here is a tradition 260 years old, and as remarkable for its probable truth as for its topographical interest. The place of Earl Roger's death has, I believe, nowhere else been stated ; the year is to this day uncertain ; but the day (July 27) has been fixed by Ordericus) . \" Earl Roger died seized of the services set on Harcott.\" (This proves Fitz Aer's Serjeantry to have existed at Domesday, and that the silence of that Record is no proof of the non-existence of such tenures; for Alcher was already seized of Harcott.) \" Earl Roger was succeeded by Hugh, his son and heir ; Hugh, by Robert his brother, ivho died without heir. Hence the King had the Seigneury of Harcott per viam Escaet\u00e6.\" (Here we note correctively, that Hugh was not really Earl Roger's heir, but was made his suc cessor in England ; also that Robert de Belesme's escheat was not by failure of heirs, but by attainder.) \" It was found by reference to the Red Book (of the Exchequer), in the Chapter entitled ' De combustione monet\u00e6,' that the whole County (i. e. Earldom) of Salop, of which the services (i. e. the Seigneury) of Harcott were part and parcel, was in manu Regis, as an Escheat, and not de jure Coron\u00e6. It was therefore discordant with Justice that a title of tenure should accrue to the Croivn, distinct from its original title.\" And again, \" Earl Roger never had any wardship of Harcott, nor had any Earl or King since, except when Edward II. had custody thereof by reason of the minority of Margery, infant heir of Thomas fitz Aer, and, even then, Edmund Earl of Arundel had custody of Aston Eyre and of half Withyford.\" (The point was, that the infant heir of a Tenant-in-capite-de-Corond, became a ward of the Crown, both as to such heir's person, and also as to all estates 1 Supra, pages 56, 57. ix. 40 b"], [358, "318 Alcheb, Domesday Lord of Aston Aer, Harcott, Middleton, Great Withyford, and Albrighton.

But where the King's Seigneury was only De escheatd, it conferred no such conclusive rights, but only affected the particular estate held in-capite.) Lastly, the Ju rors most accurately deduced the pedigree of the later Fitz Aers as follows, though they omitted to state the minority of Thomas fitz Aer at his father's death.\u2014\" John fitz Aer died seized, fye. Hugh, his son and heir, enfeoffed William Canne, who settled Harcott on the said Hugh, his wife Alina, and their heirs. The heir of Hugh and Alina was their son Thomas, whose daughter and heir, Margery, married Alan, son of Alan de Cherlton. The latter died seized of 20 librates of rent payable by his Father for the Fitz Aer estates, at Aston and Withford, and John son of Alan, now a Minor, was son and heir of Alan de Cherlton Junior.\"1 I commit to a tabular form some further particulars in the Genea logies of Fitz Aer and Cherlton. None of the knightly families of Shropshire are traceable with greater certainty to a Domesday ori ginal than that of Fitz Aer. Of Undertenants, taking a name from Withyford, some belong to Little Withyford, and have been mentioned already. Others have been named under Shawbury. There was also a Ranulph de Wydiford who acted in 1275, as Deputy-Collector under the Ab bot of Shrewsbury, of the tax of the fifteenth. John de Withyford, who occurs from 1296 to 1340, seems to have been son of Robert de Stanton. In the 14th century there was a family of Cressets seated at Withyford. In a testing-clause of 1339, Thomas Cresset of Withyford precedes Thomas Cresset of Haughton. MUCKXETOjV. We have seen that Muckleton was a member of Fitz Aer's part of Withyford. \u2014 \" Between the years 1255 and 1260,\" John, son of William fitz Aer, and Lord of Withiforde, gave and confirmed to Haghmon Abbey two half-virgates in the vill of Moclyton, which Thomas fitz Roger and Richard Kane sometime held, with a mes suage, crofts, and appurtenances, and also 4 nokes of land with mes suages, &c., in Moclyton. The grant was to sustain the Alms given at the Abbey Gate, and was in exchange for the Mill of Withyforde, which Robert, the present Grantor's Uncle {avunculus), bequeathed, with his body, to the Abbey; and which William, the present Grantor's father gave thereto.2 Witnesses, Sir Thomas de Roshall, 1 Inquisitions, 30 Edw. III., No. 46.

On June 5, 1268, Alan Champyun has a Writ of mort d'ancestre against John fitz Aer, for two-thirds of a messuage and quarter-vir gate in Muclinton. Anew Writ of 1270 speaks of two-thirds of half a, messuage and a quarter-virgate, as the subject of claim. It must have been at this very juncture that \"John fitz Aer, Lord of Widiford, gave and quitclaimed, to Haughmond Abbey, Adam, son of Alan de Mocliton, with his wife Margery.\" This was in considera tion of one merk, paid to the Grantor by the said Adam. The Grantor retains all the issue of the said Adam, whether sons or daughters (as his Villeins) . The Deed was attested by Reginald de Wideford and Roger de Preston ; \u2014 two names which have already appeared in conjunction in 1269.2 In Trinity Term 1269, John fitz Aer was under summons to an swer William de Egebaldenham (now Edgbolton), Chaplain, as to the observance of an agreement which Fitz Aer had made with Richard de la Hull of Egebaldenham, the Plaintiff's father, con cerning 6\u00a3 acres of land and meadow in Mollington. Fitz Aer now conceded to the Plaintiff, and his Mother, Isabella, 3^ acres for a term of 12 years, and 3 acres for a term of 15 years.3 A mutilated Fine of February 1271 names another son of Richard de la Hull. \u2014 \" Roger Friday and Matilda his wife, tenants of half a messuage and (some) part of a virgate at Moclyton, quitclaim the same, for themselves and the heirs of Matilda, to Alan le Kam ***, * Plaintiff. Alan, then, at their request, concedes the premises in fee to Roger, son of Richard de la Hulle of Eggebaldenham,\u2014 to hold, at a rent of Id., payable to Alan and his heirs, and by performance of all services due to the Lords of the Fee. For this Roger de la Hulle paid to Roger Friday and his wife 40 shillings.\" I think that William de Egebaldenham, Chaplain, may have been the same with William de Mokelinton, who, in an Inquest of 1302, appears as Tenant of half a virgate in Great Bolas. In 1313 we have a reappearance of Roger, son of Richard de la Hulle, after an interval of 42 years. To him did the Abbot of Haughmond then demise that nokate and half-nokate in Mocliton which Adam, son of Alan, sometime held. A rent of 7s. Qd. is 3 Placita, 53 Hen.

An other Demise, of the same date, concedes a noke, half-noke, and messuage, to the same Roger, at the same rent ; but whether the Deeds represent more than oue transaction seems doubtful. I refer back to High Ercall for the mention, about this period, of Philip de Moclyton, of William, son of Richard del Hul of Mocli ton, of Richard, his brother, and of Richard and John Wercoks of Edgebold.1 EDGEBOLTON, OR EDGEBOLD. We have seen that half Edgbold was a member of Fitz Aer's Manor of Withyford. We have also seen that Hugh de Upton was in the year 1200 a Tenant, whether rightfully or not, in Withyford. It is also clear that Hugh de Upton's tenancy descended to his heirs, and was a tenancy under Fitz Aer. Of Hugh de Upton, as Lord of Upton near Morville, I have al ready given some account.2 At the Assizes of October 1203, Richard Werecoc, being impleaded under Writ of mort d'ancestre for a vir gate in Egboldenham by Robert Goch, declared that he was the Villein of Hugh de Upton. Robert Goch had therefore leave to ex change his Writ for one against Hugh de Upton, if he chose so to do. I next find good evidence that John de Upton (Great-Grandson of Hugh de Upton, above mentioned, and who succeeded to Upton in 1283-4) was Fitz Aer's Tenant in two virgates, \u2014 part of Fitz Aer's share of Edgebolton. These two virgates were conveyed by John de Upton to Robert Corbet of Morton and his wife Matilda. Consequently in the Inquest taken January 1301, concerning the specific settlement of certain estates of Robert Corbet, deceased, we find that \" he and his wife Matilda had been jointly enfeoffed in two virgates in Egebaldenham by John de Upton, which two vir gates the deceased had held in capite under Hugh le fitz Aer, at a rent of one pair of white gloves.\"3 It was, I suppose, some small part of Robert Corbet's purchase in Edgebolton, that William, son of John de Buleton, had been dis seized of in 1292. The Defendants were \" Robert, son of Richard Corbet, and WiUiam Hord,\" but the Plaintiff failed to prosecute the Suit. About 1294-8, Margery, widow of John le Prey ers of Dothull, grants to WiUiam Goge of Eggebaldenham, and Eadith his wife, her Supra, pages 92, 93. s Supra, Vol. I. p. 140. 3 Inquisitions, 29 Edw.

Witnesses, WUliam Hord, John de Stanton, and Richard de la Hull of Mokly ton, \u2014 Dated at Welynton.3 The lands which passed in the above two Deeds I take to have been in Fitz Aer's part of Edgbold. It will presently be seen that, independently of his (probably pur chased) interest in Edgebolton, Robert Corbet of Moreton had an hereditary claim there also. \u2014 Now therefore I must speak of an other part of Edgebolton, constituting, as I suppose, the hide held by Albert at Domesday, and which, with reference to Albert's known descendants, I will caU \u2014 THE ROSSALL EEE IN WITHYEORD AND EDGBOLTON. Withyford, doubtless, contributed its share to the service of one knight and 3^ muntators, due in 1165 by Hugh fitz Albert (the known descendant of Albert, and the known ancestor of the Ros salls) to the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 Again we have seen Vivian de RossaU accused in 1200 of having occupied a part of Fitz Aer's estate in Withyford.4 The two following Deeds probably passed between the years 1190 and 1195. \u2014 The first is by a Tenant of Vivian de Roshall, the next by Vivian himself. \u2014 \" Roger de Egebaldesham, son of Roger, gives to Haghmon Abbey, a virgate of land in Egebaldesham in the Parish of Shaubury.

These he gave to Roger, son of Simon de Jagedon, in ex change for land at Jagedon (a place now lost). One of the said three virgates was assigned by Roger fitz Simon to his Mother in dower, but about the year 1230 he sold to Vivian de Roshall, all his interest in Edgebolton. His deed, which is in the form of a Quitclaim or surrender, indicates that Vivian de Rosshall had re tained at least a nominal seigneury in Edgebolton. It runs as fol lows. \u2014 \"\\} Roger, son of Simon de Jagedon, have surrendered {reddidi) and quitclaimed to Sir Vivian de Roshalle, for 10 merks, all the land which I held of him in Egebalden, viz. three virgates which the said Vivian heretofore gave to me in exchange for the land of Jagedon.

Richard Corbet held these two virgates, I presume, under Vivian de Roshall, so that his alleged grant was in the nature of a surrender. His right so to grant or surrender, was afterwards brought in question. \u2014 His Widow, Pe tronilla, was surviving in 1272, and then claimed the said two vir gates as her marriage-portion {maritagium), saying that her late husband, though she could not gainsay him in his lifetime, had wrongfully alienated them to Vivian de Rossall.

They appeared not to the prosecu tion, but the Abbot of Haughmond appeared in their stead, ac cepted the defence, and called Vivian de Roshall (grandson, I think, of the former Vivian) to warranty. Vivian appeared and stated that neither Richard Corbet nor his wife Petronilla had been seized of the premises for 10 years after their espousals. This Petronilla denied j1 \u2014 and here the Record breaks off. The above Suit and its chronological significances bear strongly on the descent of the Corbets of Morton, a descent which I have treated too hastily under Wattlesborough. It now appears that there must have been three Richard Corbets in succession ; that it was the second who married the daughter of Bartholomew Toret, and the third who married Petronilla, \" Lady of Edgbold,\" as she is caUed in the Heraldic Pedigrees. Of this however we will say more under Moreton Corbet. Robert Corbet, son and successor of Richard and Petronilla, does not appear to have recovered the estate claimed by his mother in 1272, though, as we have seen, he pur chased an equal estate in Fitz Aer's part of Edgbold. The evidence that Haughmond Abbey retained its acquisitions here, is as follows.- In 1274, the Abbot demises a virgate in Edge bolton to Richard BurneU and Elianor his wife, for 30 years, retain ing a rent of 12s., suit of Court, and a heriot. \u2014 In 9 Edw. II. (1315-6) the Abbot demises a messuage and virgate here to WUliam, son of Philip Cok, for life ; also a messuage and virgate to Johanna, wife of Roger de Smethcote and her three sons, for the longest life. \u2014 In 15 Edw. II. (1321-2), the Abbot demises a messuage and vir gate here to Walter Cresset and his wife, Alice, for their lives. \u2014 On January 31, 1339, Thomas, son of Thomas de Lee of Staunton, agrees with the Abbey to make a new ditch in the Abbey lands at Edgbold, as a boundary between Edgbold and Sowbatch. The ditch was to extend from the King's highway to the River Roden. Thomas was to pay a rent of 4>d. to the Abbey, for which, if unpaid, the Canons might distrain on Sowbatch. Witnesses, Sir William de Ercalue, Sir Robert Corbet of Morton, Knights; and John de Withiforde. Between the years 1377 and 1399, the Abbot demises a messuage and virgate here, to John and Rawlin, sons of Roger Cok, for ther lives, at 10s. rent. In the Valor of 1535-6, the Abbot of Haghmond's receipts from Haughton, Astley, Edgebaldham, Isombridge, Sugden, and Roding ton were returned collectively, as \u00a32. 8s. 8d. per annum? 1 Assizes, 56 Hen.

The evidence for the sometime existence of this Chapel, and its subjection to Shawbury Church, has been already given. It appears to have been founded in the time of Bishop Clinton (11 29-1 148), and endowed by the Lord of the Fee, probably that Robert fitz Aer who founded a similar Chapel at Aston Eyre.1 The Canons of Haughmond, as Rectors of Shawbury, of course took small care of its Subject-Chapels. This was remedied in some degree by the second Robert fitz Aer, who about 1190-5 gave the Canons certain land at Newton near Ellesmere on condition that they would have divine service performed in his Chapel of Withy ford, three days a week, when he or his wife or their heirs were re sident in the Manor. But the Parishioners of Withyford were ex cluded from this agreement, and were not to attend the said chapel services, to the injury of the Mother-Church. All Festivals were excepted from the agreement, except the feasts of St. Thomas (Dec. 21), Pentecost, and All Saints (Nov. 1). To strengthen this agree ment Robert fitz Aer and his wife Emma gave their bodies to the Church of Haghmon, that they might receive good offices, when dead, from those whose Church they had benefited while living.2 \u2014 Satinet In speaking of this important locality it is necessary to follow in strict chronological order those early notices which allude to it either as a Manor, or a Parish, or the Caput of a Hundred. \u2014 During the Saxon \u00e6ra it was, as a Manor, small in extent, but great in propor tionate value. This discrepancy probably arose from its being a Royal Manor, and the Caput of the Hundred to which it gave a name. More than doubled in value, the Manor and Hundred were of course annexed to the Palatine demesnes of Earl Roger de Mont gomery. Though Earl Roger's Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey was written and expedited after Domesday, it recapitulates his grauts of an earlier date. Among other things the Earl gave to the Abbey 1 Supra, Vol. I. p. 207. 1 Haughmond Chartulary, fo. 152."], [367, "327 HODNET. \" the Church of Hodenet with all its appurtenances.\"1 And Domes day chronicles the transfer in the following survey of the Manor. \u2014 \" The Earl himself holds Odenet. King Edward held it. Here is a hide and half. In demesne are Tii ox-teams ; and (there are) xn Villains, n Boors, a Priest, and a Provost with vn teams ; and yet there might be ix additional teams (employed) here. Here is a little wood, yielding no income. The church of St. Peter holds the Church of this Manor. In King Edward's time this manor yielded an income of \u00a33. 6*. 8d. Now, with the Hundred which pertains thereto, it yields \u00a38.\"2 After Domesday the next allusion which we have to Hodnet, is the mention of Earl Roger's bestowal of the Church, in WiUiam II.'s confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey.3 Then we come to the spurious Charter of Earl Hugh, conveying perhaps some proportion of truth in its averment, that the Earl granted to the Abbey \" the tithes of his demesnes of Hodeneth, and of Peopelawa (Peplow), and of Losces ford (Losford).\"* Earl Hugh's more authentic Charter to the Abbey confirms two-thirds of the demesne-tithes of Loskesfort and of Pres tone as the gift of one Hunald, and speaks only of the demesne-tithes of Hodenet and Peppelawe as his own personal gift.5 Some other Charter of Earl Hugh, obsolete in the original, but inspected by Bishop Clinton within 50 years ofthe Earl's death, \"gave and con firmed \" to the Abbey \" two-thirds of the demesne of Hodeneth and of the demesne of Pepelawe, and of the demesne of Loschesford.\" I will not here pursue a topic which relates to Hodnet, in respect of its parish or its parochial members, rather than its Manor. Enough has been said to show that whatever feoffments Earl Hugh may have granted in Hodnet or its Post-Domesday members, he retained the central Manor in demesne. And it is clear, I think, that Hodnet came to the hands of King Henry I. as a manor of Palatine demesne, but not so to the hands of King Henry II. In the latter case it would have formed part of that territory so often aUuded to in these pages as forming the Corpus ComitaMs. Such was not the result with Hodnet or any of its members. King Henry I. undoubtedly founded the Honour of Montgomery, a Lordship, on the peculiar constitution and endowment of which I shall have much to say hereafter. King Henry I. also, as I think, founded the Seneschalcy of Montgomery , and endowed that hereditary office not only with the Domesday Manor of Hodnet, but with cer- 1 Monasticon, III. 520, Num.

A statement of the 13th century, viz. that the Seneschalcy of Montgomery had existed since the Conque'st,1 was but the halluci nation of a provincial Jury. Montgomery, whether as a town or castle, was non-existent for years after the Norman invasion. But we may well 'admit that the first Seneschal of Montgomery was the nominee of King Henry I., and was the Ancestor of that powerful family, which adopted the name of De Hodnet from its principal possession. The name of this first Seneschal is, I believe, unrecorded, but I have little doubt as to the race from which he sprang. I will give four reasons for thinking that he was of the same stock as the Fitz Warins, and perhaps a younger son of Warin de Metz himself. \u2014 (1.) The Fitz Warin Chronicle calls Baldwin de Hodnet, of King John's time, cousin of the Fitz Warins of that period, and describes him, with ascertained truth, as a sharer in their rebellion. \u2014 (2.) The Hodnets were Vassals ofthe elder house of Fitz Warins in two instances, viz. Welbatch and Moston. \u2014 (3.) Both the Hod nets and the elder Fitz Warins obtained great and contiguous, and probably cotemporary, feoffments in the Barony of Caus, viz. at Westbury and Alberbury. \u2014 (4.) The arms borne by De Hodnet, were Fitz Warin Arms, viz. Quarterly per fesse indented azure and or ; \u2014 the difference of tincture being an early Heraldic mode of marking cadency.3 I now proceed to give such particulars of the family of Hodnet as have not already transpired under Westbury. Ono de Hodnet (I.) has been seen attesting two Marchamley Deeds, the latest of which probably passed in or before 1194. In this instance he is accompanied by Baldwin his son, and by Alan his brother. 1 Rot. Hundred. II. 58. take as to date (vide supra, Vol. VI. p. 366); but John de Hodnet bore for arms, \u2014 Quarterly per fesse indented Arg. and Chi., with a label of 5 points azure.

A MS. in the British Museum (No. 21,018, p. 334) notices a John de Hodnet as admitted to Sutton Church on Feb. 24, 1225-6, at presentation of the Prior and Convent of Wenlock.

This was in consequence of the recent death of Baldwin de Hodnet, who but a month before had received that high mark of the King's confidence, already set forth under Westbury. Odo de Hodnet (II. ), son and heir of Baldwin, by Cecily de Hadley, came of age in 1228. At a Forest-Assize, held in 1230, Odo de Hodenet covenanted to pay an annual ferm of 86?. for 2 acres of Forest-land, to be taken out of Regard. The charge is made against him more or less regularly on the Pipe-Rolls of 40 years foUowing, and in 1273 he owed 9s. 8d. on this account, or the arrears of 14| years.

Maston, here alluded to, was probably Moston, but I cannot define the nature of those Royal dues which Hodnet and Corbet thus combined to buy off. At the Assizes of November 1240, four Placita Nativitatis, as they were called, resulted in Final Concords whereby Odo de Hod net granted manumission to certain Tenants-in- Villeinage. He thus released the Villeinage {nativitatem) and servitude of two bro thers, Richard and William de Wulfrinton, for 2 merks, of WiUiam Sylyon for 6 merks, of Henry Sylton for 6 merks, and of William fitz Levenath for 20s. In July 1241 I find Odo de Hodnet commissioned as a Justice to try a local cause. In 1250 Geoffrey de Langley, Justice of the Forest, amerced Odo de Hodenet 30 merks for venison-trespass. In the Pipe-Roll of 1252 Odo de Hodenet owes 23\u00a3 merks of this amercement, and 25 merks more for some Charter which he had obtained, but of which I find no enrolment in the usual Record. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 speaks of Hodnet as follows. \u2014 \" Sir Odo de Hodenet holds the Manor of Hodenet, from the Conquest of England, in capite, of Mongomeri {i. e. as of the Honour of Montgomery), and by service of Seneschal (acting as Seneschal) at the mandate of the Lords of Mongomeri ; \u2014 to wit, he shall abide in the Bailiwick of Montgomeri Castle, at the charges and at the discretion of the said Lords, and shall have a house there sufficient for himself and his followers {famili\u00e6) to reside in. He does suit to the County, and, every three weeks, to the Hundred.\"1 At the Assizes of January 1256, Sir Odo de Hodnet acted as a Juror in causes of Grand Assize. An Inquest, held pursuant to a Writ of Sept. 18, 1257, found that it would be no injury to the Crown or the Country, if Odo de Hodnet were to enclose two foot paths which ran through the middle of Hodnet Park ; \u2014 provided that he gave a different course to the said footpaths outside his Park, one towards the East, the other towards the North.3 In Au gust 1256, July 1258, and February 1259, Odo de Hodnet was commissioned as a Justice for the gaol-delivery of Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth. In Easter Term 1261, Ranulf Payn was suing Odo de Hodnet for a debt of 9 merks, but the Knight, now, as often previously, failed to appear at Westminster. In the period which now ensued, Odo de Hodnet's known cha- 1 Rot. Hundred. II. 58. \u25a0 Inquisitions, 41 Hen.

In Michaelmas Term 1265 and January 1266, Odo de Hodnet, or his Attorney, Alan de Hodnet, appeared twice coram Rege, complaining how William Trumwyn, Stephen de Ocle, and others, had, during the late troubles, devastated with fire and rapine his Manor of Hodnet. The Defendants in this cause never occur as appearing to the charge, but always as Defaulters. So too Odo de Hodnet was prosecuted by John de Bottelegh (his own Tenant, I think), for seizing his lands at Langeford during the recent troubles and still detaining his goods. The suit was called on in January 1266, and Hodnet's Manucaptors were amerced for his non-appearance. The result I do not find. In November 1268, July 1269, and January 1272, Odo de Hod net was again commissioned as a Justice to deliver Bridgnorth Gaol. A Patent of June 27, 1270, shows that Sir Odo de Hodnet had, during the civil wars, been in the following of that distinguished Royalist, Hamo le Strange, who had written to the King certifying that fact. The King therefore, for his part, pardons the said Odo for all trespasses committed in defiance of the Provisions of Oxford,1 up to the 10th of March, 1268. The Inquest, taken in 1273, on the death of George de Cantilupe, Lord of Montgomery, seems to have included Hodnet among the Knights'-fees held of that Honour.2 The Inquest held Feb. 15, 1284, on Odo de Hodnet's death, is rather more full than the Hundred-Roll as to the Serjeantry of the Seneschals of Montgomery. When on duty, the Seneschal was to, or might, have 5 horses, 4 greyhounds, and 6 Brachets in his train. His house in the Castle was to be sufficient for his wife, and one damsel, and the rest of his following. If he tarried there for his own pleasure he was to pay his own charges and then depart {red dat compotum suum et recedat). His Manor of Hodnet, held by such service, was valued at J19. 10s. per annum, arising from a messuage, garden, and 4 carucates of land, from assized rents, a Park, and the profits of the Manor Court, from a weekly market, and two Mills.3 In Easter Term 1284, Milisent de Montalt (Sister and Coheiress of George de Cantilupe) was impleading\u2014 - William de Hodnet for the service of a knight's fee in Hod- 1 The edicts of the Mad Parliament, I held at Oxford, in June 1258. 2 Calend.

Longford, Peplow, Parva Bowlas, Preston (on the Wealdmoors), Horton, and half the vill of Lawley of the King in capite, the Jurors knew not by what service. The said William had at Hodnet rights of Market, Fair, and Free Warren, under a Charter of King Heury III., and he used those franchises.\" Here I should observe that when the Hodnets are said to be Tenants-in-capite, the expression is not inconsistent with their holding mediately under the Lords of Montgomery. The Jurisdiction and tenure of these Lords was much qualified by a direct control, exercised by the Crown over the Castle and Honour of Montgomery. In January 1287, William de Hodnet was appointed one of the Conservators of the Peace in Shropshire. On a Jury-list of 1290, though he takes precedence of Sir Ralph de Sandford, knight, he is not styled a knight himself. At the Assizes of October 1292 he appears as a Knight, and as a Juror in causes of Grand Assize. His exercise of Free Warren in Hodnet was made matter of present ment on this occasion. His tenure of Hodnet, by service of Sene schalcy, was also set forth, and the Manor valued at \u00a34-0 per annum. Peplow and Preston were treated as members of Hodnet, and the alienations therein specified, as I have elsewhere stated them. The Tenants in one instance affirmed that \" their Ancestors had held under the Ancestors of William de Hodnet from a time to which memory did not reach, viz. from the time when Roger de Beleme {sic), Earl of Salop, enfeoffed WiUiam de Hodnet's ancestors in the aforesaid Serjeantry.\" This bold assertion was corroborated by a Jury, but circumstantially it cannot have been true. William de Hodnet was, immediately after this, questioned under Quo Waranto for holding a Market, exercising Free Warren, and assizing bread and beer in Hodnet. The two former privileges he justified by a Charter of Henry III.2 The third privilege, he pleaded, was involved in the first. So he was dismissed sine die? In 1294, he was appointed Assessor and Collector of the tax of the Tenth in Shropshire. In 1297, as holding lands or rents of \u00a320 annual value, and upwards, he was summoned to perform mi litary service with horses, arms, &c., in parts beyond the Seas. The Muster was to be at London on July 7, but on Oct. 23 William de Hodnet was appointed a Commissioner of Array for Salop and Staf- 1 Abbrev.

In May 1298, he was returned to the Parliament of York as a Knight of the Shire, his Manucaptors being Roger Caber and Stephen P.arker, both of Hodnet. In the same month, and for the same day (May 25), he had military summons to be at York, for service against the Scots. On Nov. 12, 1300, a Fine was levied between WUliam de Hodnet (Plaintiff) and William, son of Laurence de Ludlow and his wife Matilda (Deforciants) of the Manor of Hodnet. William de Hod net first acknowledged the Manor to be the right of Matilda, by gift of himself to her and her husband. They in turn granted it to William de Hodnet for his life, to hold under themselves and the heirs of Matilda at a rose-rent, and by performance of all capital services. Remainder to William de Ludlow and Matilda his wife, and the heirs of Matilda. A similar settlement of William de Hod net's other estates followed in July 1301. I have already set it forth,1 and need only to explain here that the places called Wylbe leye Corbet and Wolureton were Weobley and Woolerton near Hod net, but that they were not members of Hodnet, and that, whatever William de Hodnet held in either, must have been held as a Feoffee. In the case of Woolerton he doubtless held under Shrewsbury Abbev. In 1301 William de Hodnet had again a military summons to serve against the Scots ; but in this and the following year his ac tual employment seems rather to have been as an Assessor and Col lector of Taxes in his native County.2 The time of his death is un certain, but he was succeeded in all his estates by his son-in-law, \u2014 WilliAsM de Ludlow7, of the origin aud rise of whose family I have spoken under Stokesay and Ludlow.3 This William had suc ceeded his Father, Laurence, at Stokesay, before the year 1296. In 1297 he had been returned from the Counties of Hereford, Salop, and Stafford, as a Tenant of 20 librates of lands and rents, and so, liable to personal service in foreign parts. In 1301, as a Hereford shire Landowner he had summons for military service against the Scots. In 1301-2 he appears as Assessor and Collector of the tax of the fifteenth in Herefordshire.4 In 1307 he was returned as a Knight of the Shire for Salop. As a CoUector or Assessor of taxes in Shropshire, he appears in 1307, 1309, 1315, and 1316; as a Con servator of the Peace or a Justice for special occasions, he occurs in 1307, 1308, 1309, 1310, and 1314; as a Commissioner of Array, 3 Supra, Vol. V. pp. 36, 290. 4 Parl.

In 1313 he obtained a pardon, as an adherent of the Earl of Lancaster in the matter of Piers Gavaston. ln 1314 and 1316 he had military summons to serve in person against the Scots.1 In the Nomina Villarum of March 1316 he appears as Joint Lord of Stokesay, and Lord of Westbury. Doubtless also he was Lord of Hodnet, though William de Hodnet's name is en tered in that position. The Inquest on William de Ludlow's death (taken November 11, 1316) has been in part quoted under Westbury.2 It values Hodnet with its members of (Little) Bolas, Peplow, and Longford, at \u00a323. 7s. 4d. {per annum). It recites the Pine levied thereof (in 1300) as having been levied by Royal license. Hodnet was held of the King, and of the Honour of Montgomery , by Serjeantry, &c. (as be fore). The Seneschal's suit while resident in the Castle was to be maintained at the cost of the Lords of Montgomery. It included the Seneschal's wife, a Valet, a Chambermaid, 4 horses, 2 grey hounds, and 4 brachets.3 The conjoint feoffment of Matilda de Hodnet of course left the Manor in her hands for life. The King too, ordered the Escheator to respect her rights, and not to intromit with any lands of William de Ludlow, deceased. Matilda de Lud low remarried with William Wyn. The Escheator at length dis covered that the late William de Ludlow had held in capite de co rona, 100 acres of bosc and 10 librates of rent at Markeleye in Herefordshire, the custody whereof ought at this juncture to have fallen to the Crown as a matter of Prerogative. So the Escheator reseized the said land, but the King ordered Matilda's dower therein to be assigned to her and her second husband. A Writ-Close of November 20, 1318, recites these particulars, but confesses that the King is still uncertain as to his rights. He therefore nullifies the reassumptive act of his Escheator, and orders the receipts from Markeley to be made over to whomsoever they belong, saving the King's right and saving the aforesaid dower.4 Laurence de Ludlow, son and heir of William, is variously stated to have been born in 1301 and in 1304.5 We must accept the earlier date, for in May 1324 he appears as a Knight, and as summoned to attend the Great Council then impending at West minster.6 I have already given some further facts in the descent of the 4 Clans. 12 Edw.

To enter in detail on their ulterior history would carry me far beyound my usual limits. I have consigned a few principal names and ascertained dates to the form of a tabular Genealogy. The Undertenants in Hodnet proper can hardly be distin guished from Tenants of the Lords of Hodnet in circumjacent lo calities. There was always a risk in granting feoffments in a Ser jeantry, so that, I suppose, the Tenants in Hodnet itself were very few. Nevertheless, a few names may be mentioned as conveniently here as elsewhere. \u2014 Paulinus de Hodnet had apparently, in October 1203, some claim or interest in the neighbouring Manor of Weston. At the Assizes then held, the following allusions to a pending suit were made. \u2014 \" Augnes, wife of Paulinus, makes the said Paulinus her attorney against Thomas fitz Noel and Griffin fitz Gerward in a Plea of Assize.\" Thomas Noel and Margery his wife essoign themselves in a Plea of land against Paulinus de Hodnet, by Richard de Alvitheleg and Richard fitz Roger. \" Griffin fitz Garforth essoigns himself by William Monk in a Plea of mort d'ancestre, against Paulinus de Hodnet and his wife Agnes. \u2014 Adjourned to Worcester.\" \" Matilda, wife of Griffin fitz Garforth, had named Griffin fitz Enuch (elsewhere called Griffin fitz Eniow) her Attorney in the same suit.\" The Attorney named by Griffin fitz Garforth is apparently \" William fitz Seman.\" Of him we have heard before.1 At Gloucester, but during the same Iter, \" Paulinus de Hodnet fines one merk for license to accord. His Sureties were Griffin fitz Eniow and William fitz Seman.\" This Fine is made a Crown debt on the Pipe-Roll of 1204. Soon after this, Paulinus, son of Gilbert Chaplain of Hodnet, concedes and gives in pure almoign to Haghmon Abbey, half of all his meadow and moor* according to these boundaries, viz. from Webeleia (Weobley) along the stream to Eitaneslache, and in width along the way which leads to Eitaneslache from Eivine 's-seilion ,- \u2014 which moor the Canons had already assarted at their own expense.

He was dismissed sine die from some Suit, because two of the Plaintiff's therein were dead.3 Of Radulf de Hoduet, occurring from 1231 to 1244, I have spoken under Alberbury, Corselle, Peplow, and Edgmond.4 He was a younger son of Odo de Hoduet (I.). Also Richard de Hodnet, a younger son of Odo de Hodnet (II.) , aud occurring in 1280 and 1292, has been noticed underWestbury,5 and under Peplow.6 I further fiud him acting on local Juries in 1300 aud 1301. Thomas Cabot, who occurs on local Juries in 1300, 1301, and 1306, was, I think, a Tenant in Hodnet, or one of its Dependencies. Longford, if indeed it was a member of the Domesday Manor of Hodnet, appears to have been the only oue. Peplow, Little Bolas, Preston, Horton, and Lawley, stood in quite another ratio at Domes day, and must clearly be taken as subsequent annexations. The great distance which separated Longford from Hodnet, and the fact that it was in another Parish (Moretou Say), suggest that it too had belonged to some other Domesday Manor than Hodnet, but had been severed from its Parent, and annexed to that Fee of the Sene schals of Montgomery which we know to have been so industriously and so anomalously enlarged in other cases. Still, as I caDnot point out the Domesday Manor from which Lougford was thus severed, I must treat of it as an original member of Hodnet. We have seen a Styche Deed, about the year 1200, attested by Robert de Longeford and Turstan his son, and by Peter de La Forde and Hugh his son.7 We have also seen Robert de Hong forde (probably Longford) attesting a Deed of about the same pe riod,8 which concerned Hopton and Hopley,\u2014 places very near to Hodnet. Here then we have the local and the feudal connection of Robert de Longford in just that contrast which illustrates our sub- ject. This Robert de Longford gave half a virgate in Langeford, to gether with his body, to Combermere Abbey. The Abbey, about the year 1235, conveyed the same to Yvo Meverel in exchange for 1 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit.

Yvo Meverel was not only to be responsible for the services heretofore due from the Abbey to the Seigneural Lord of Longford, but was to pay the Abbey 60?. rent for the said half virgate,1 and was also to continue responsible, he and his heirs, for the services due on the land which he gave up. This Cirograph, as it is called, was attested by Peter de Eyton, Hugh de Say (of Moreton), William de Studies (Stych), Robert de Dray ton, Thomas Rabath, and Richard de Tunstall.2 Another tenement in Longford, viz. half a hide, appears to have been held by Thomas de Dunton under Odo de Hodnet (II.) . In Michaelmas Term 1242, Isabella, widow of the said Thomas, was suing the said Odo for a third of the same. After repeated defaults, made by the Defendant, Isabella recovered her claim.3 A deed, of about 1260, re-introduces the family of Forde as in terested in Longford. \u2014 \" Robert de Forde gives to Richard Pan tulf, the Hunter, in frank marriage with Alice, the Grantor's daughter, half a virgate in Longeford. Witnesses, Sir Ralph le Boteler, and Matildis Pauntolf his wife ; Sir Yvo Pantolf of Rude lawe; Ralph de Saunford; Robert de Say of Moreton; and Roger de Coleshasel.'\"** I have noticed the Pleas of trespass and violence which John de Bottelegh was maintaining in 1266-7, against Odo de,,Hodnet, his Suzerain.6 Such Suits were necessarily heard coram Rege. It was another matter, viz. actual \" disseizin of his free tenement in Lange ford,\" for which John Bottel' obtained a Writ againt Odo de Hod net in September 1266. Giles de Erdinton was deputed to try the latter suit. Except the mention of Longford, in 1284-5, and in later Inquests, as a member of Hodnet, 1 find little more of the place or its Tenants. Ralph de Longford, Juror in a High-Hatton Inquest in 1300, may have been of Longford near Newport. I may here resume a matter of some topographical interest. \u2014 The great road which still runs in a straight line from Bletchley to Hinstock, and crosses the Tern at Tern Hill, is undoubtedly of 1 This rent-charge of 6d. on Longford remained with Combermere Abbey till the Dissolution (Valor Ecclesiasticus, V. 216).

One is the arrow like course of the road itself; the other is, that the precise point at which it crossed the River Tern was called Stratford in the time of Henry III.1 This Road was at the same period, and for a century afterwards, called \" The Longford.\" The Vill of Longford which lay more than a mile to the North-East of this Road must not mis lead us as to the course of the latter, though the Vill undoubtedly took its name from a certain proximity to this most ancient and most famous thoroughfare. \u2014 A Writ of King Edward IL, dated May 20, 1319, orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to ascertain whether the Royal Road called Longeford, between Bleccheleye and Neweport, and the bridges and footpaths {calceta) thereof, w7ere so dilapidated by the overflowing of the circumjacent marshes, as that no one could pass thereby with out peril of life ; \u2014 also whether many passengers had actually thus perished ;\u2014 also whether any parties were bound to repair the road ; \u2014 and if not, whether it would injure the Crown to allow a levy of the due called Pontage towards such repairs. In the next month the Sheriff (Robert de Grendon) held Inquest on this matter at Drayton in Hales. The bad state of the road, and the damage caused by floods were substantiated ; also the peril of passengers ; but it did not appear that any loss of life had hitherto happened. The repairs lay specifically on no one. The Levy of Pontage for a fixed term, would injure neither the Crown nor any other.2 CHURCH OF ST. LTJKE OF HODNET. Resuming my account of this Church and Parish at the point where its history ceases to illustrate the history of the Manor, I come to another of Bishop Clinton's Confirmations to Shrewsbury Abbey. The former Charter of the same Prelate treated of tithes. This confirms \"the Church of Hodnet with its Chapels and the annual pension of 2 merks receivable therefrom by the Abbey.\"3 Again, Bishop Durdent's Charter confirms \"the Church of St. Luke of Hodeneht, with the tithe of the same Vill, and the tithe of Papelawe, and Locheforde (Peplow and Losford), and with the Chapels pertaining to the aforesaid Church.\"4 Subsequent Charters, whether Royal, Archiepiscopal, or Episcopal, are but repetitions of the above.

In 1291, the Church of Hodnet, with its Chapels, was valued at the high sum of \u00a340 per annum, over and above the Abbot of Shrewsbury's pension of \u00a31. 6s. 8d? In 1341, the Assessors of the Ninth inadequately took the Taxa tion of Hodnet Church to be \u00a340. They rated the Parish at 40 merks to the Ninth, remarking that the difference of 20 merks con sisted of Glebe land and other profits of the Church, not computable in the present instance. The Temporalities of Shrewsbury Abbey contributed a rateable part of the current assessment.2 The allusion is to the Abbot's estate at Woolerton. The Valor of 1534-5, gives the Rectory of Hodnet, then held by William Marshall, as worth only \u00a330 per annum ; and that sum was chargeable with 13*. 4d. for synodals, 6s. for procurations, and with a pension of \u00a33 to Marchamley Chapel.3 In the Abbot of Shrewsbury's return to the Valor we find that his pension of \u00a31 . 6s. 8d. was still receivable from Hodnet Church.4 RECTORS OF HODNET. The mention of Ralph, Vicar of Hodnet, about 1253-63,5 must not suggest that the Rectory was ever impropriated by Shrewsbury Abbey. Probably the original Saxon Foundation was so far Colle giate as to include a Vicar, and the office was revived whenever any Rector chose to name an acting substitute. The following Rectors (except where the contrary is expressed) were all presented by the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury. \u2014 Master G. de Weston, \" Parson of Hodeneth,\" occurs in April 1241. Roger le Strange was presented by a Patent of August 7, 1241-. This was during a vacancy of Shrewsbury Abbey; but, on the same day, the King assented to the election of Abbot Adam.

Roger de Mortimer, Clerk, admitted October 23, 1329. He had a year's license of non-residence in October 1331, and died February 28, 1332. Ralph de la Rode, Clerk, was admitted May 3, 1332.

Richard de Derby, Clerk, was presented by the King, on Oct. 20, 1345, because of a recent vacancy of Shrewsbury Abbey.3 A second Patent of May 4, 1346, reiterates this presentation, the King having recovered the right against Adam, Abbot of Salop, who had disputed it in the Court of King's Bench.4 William de Manton occurs as Rector 12 December, 1361. Nicholas de Heth resigned in 1388, being ejected by process of Quare impedit brought by the King, who ought to have pre sented during that vacancy of Salop Abbey which was concurrent with the last vacancy of Hodnet Rectory.

Weston, whether by escheat of Wilbam Peverel of Lon don in Henry I.'s time, or by forfeiture of William Peverel of Nottingham in 1154-5, or by lapse of some tenure, intermediate or subsequent, was an escheat in the hands of Henry II. in 1169. The King held it till the year 1175 and then, as I have fully stated under Alveley, granted it to Guy le Strange.4 On the death of Ralph le Strange in the summer of 1195, Weston became temporarily an Escheat. A sum of 12s. ld. was the ferm thereof, realized by the Escheator in the quarter ending Michaelmas 1195 ; and at Easter 1196, half a year's ferm, similarly accounted of, was \u00a31. 14s. 5d., besides the winter pannage of the vill which had produced 7s. The Fine proffered by the Sisters and Coheirs of Ralph le Strange in 1196, made them of course Co parceners in Weston. Their tenure was not undisturbed. Within four years, Robert fitz Iwein, alias Robert Baggard, claimed the Manor, and (if a procedure by writ of mort d'ancestre may be taken to imply as much) claimed it as heir of a former owner, viz. Iwein. This produced a Fine from the Coheiresses and their husbands. They offered King John 15 merks to prevent any trial being held between them and the Plaintiff.5 Hence the following Writ, issued by King John to his Chief Justice, Geoffrey fitz Piers, and certified by the latter to the Courts of Westminster in April 1200. \u2014 \" The King injoins Geoffrey fitz Piers not to hold, or suffer to be held, the trial subsisting between Robert fitz Iwein (of the one part) and Thomas Noel and Margaret his wife, Richard de Wapenbiry and Juliana his wife, and Griffin Walensis and Matilda his wife (of the other part), concerning the land of Weston, which the said Robert claims against them, and whereof they have a Charter of King Henry, the King's father, as they affirm, granting the same to William (read Wido) le Strange, father of the said Ladies ; \u2014 be cause the King wishes to be informed what ingress Iwein (father of the present Plaintiff) had in the said land, and how he lost it.\"6 In the same Term as that in which this Writ was exhibited at Westminster, Griffin, son of Gervase Goch (the Griffin Walensis of the above Fine), is noticed as not appearing at Westminster in a 1 Domesday, fo. 256, b, 2. 5 Supra, Vol. III. pp. 49, 50. 4 Supra, Vol. III. p. 127. 6 Oblata, p. 64. 3 Vol. II. pp. 104-5; Vol. VI.pp. 310-1. <\u2022 Rot.

The reason of Griffin's non-appear ance was warranted by a Writ of King John, as I have elsewhere stated.1 Robert Bainard was identical with Robert fitz Iwein. Before the close of the year 1200, Robert Baggard, as he is here called, endeavoured to counteract the move of his opponents by a Counter-fine of greater magnitude. \u2014 \" He gave 40 merks, that the King would once again {alia vice) order the recognition (trial) to proceed, which had been arraigned under writ of mort d'ancestre, before the Justices at the Exchequer, between the Plaintiff, and Thomas Noel, &c., concerning one Knight's-fee ; \u2014 which recognition had been made a remanet by Writ of the King ; \u2014 and (the Fine stipulated) that the trial should come on at Westminster on the octaves of Hilary (January 20, 1201). \"2 I do not find any instalment paid on the proffers of either party in the above suit. However in January 1201, Geoffrey fitz Piers orders the trial \" concerning a knight's-fee in Weston \" to proceed, in consequence of the later Fine. The Justices in banco issued summonses accordingly to all parties concerned, to appear at West minster in three weeks of Easter (1201).3 Then the cause was adjourned sine die, because of the transfretation of Thomas Noel, one of the defendants.4 Three Fines, levied at Westminster on June 4, 1201, show that Robert Bagard's pretensions were no mean ones. \u2014 For a Quitclaim of one-third of Weston to Thomas and Margaret Noel, he got \u00a314. 8s. 5<i. ; for a similar Quitclaim to Griffin Cos {i. e. Coch) and his wife Matilda, he got a like sum ; and a third Quitclaim to Richard de Wapenbiri and Juliana his wife was purchased by the same consideration. In short, the Manor of Weston cost its reputed Coheiresses \u00a343. 5s. 3d., a sum which I cannot suppose to have been less than the value of the fee-simple at that period. I have explained under Alveley how in 1211 the Coparceners in Weston were reduced to two, viz. Thomas de Albo Monasterio and Griffin de Sutton.5 Their estates, whether in Alveley or Weston, were only valued at 5 merks (\u00a33. 6s. 8d.) per annum. A Record of 1227 alludes incidentally to one Coparcener in Weston. Matilda le Strange (as Widow of Griffin Goch) is said to be at the King's disposal (as regarded her remarriage). Her land in Bradford Hun dred was valued at \u00a33. 3s. per annum,6 but this may have included her dower in Rowton and Ellardine.

It will be remembered that only two Coheiresses of Ralph le Strange were at this time represented in Shropshire.1 These were Matilda (herself living) and Margaret, whose inheritance was now divided between her two daughters ; \u2014 Alice Noel, widow of William de Harcourt, and Joan Noel, widow of Thomas fitz Eustace. Al ready had Alice and Joan parted with their shares of Weston, and even their Aunt Matilda, who had that portion of the Manor, on which was the Rock called Red-Cliff, had sold the said Rock and 2 acres of land. King Henry III.'s Charter, confirming the various acquisitions of his great Servant, Henry de Audley, bears date May 2, 1227. It includes the following items. \u2014 Ex dono Alicie de Harecurt, filie Thome Noel, totam terram suam de Weston cum omnibus pertinenciis suis. Ex 'dono Johanne filie Thome Nohel totam terram suam in Weston cum omnibus pertinenciis suis. Ex dono Matilde Extranee totam Rupem de Radeclif, quantum ad earn pertinet, et duas acras terre de dominico suo in Weston? We see instantly what was Henry de Audley's object in obtaining Red-Cliff. A Patent of August 17, 1227, empowers him to build3 the Castle of Radeclif. Henceforth we hear of Red-Castle as the Shropshire Stronghold of the Audleys, and the Manor of Weston is to this day called Weston-under -Red-Castle. Soon afterwards Matilda le Strange's moiety of Weston was acquired wholly by Audley. He obtained it from her son, Madoc de Sutton, to whom he gave in exchange Stanway and Stoneacton.4 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 gives the following account of Weston. \u2014 \" James de Alditheley holds the Manor of Weston, viz. one moiety under Sir Richard de Harcourt, to whom he pays a yearly rent of 13s. 5d., and the other moiety under Madoc de Sutton, in exchange for Stanway. And Weston is 4| hides, and pays neither stretward nor motfee, nor does it any suit to County or Hundred.\"6 I cannot help remarking how these immunities were common to another of Ranulf Peverel's Domesday Manors, viz. Cressage.7 As the intermediate histories of Cressage and Weston had been quite distinct, perhaps the said immunities arose with Ranulf Peverel himself. Another point to observe is that the mesne-interest of 1 Supra, Vol III., pp. 139, 142. 2 Rot. Chart. 11 Hen. III., p. 1, No, 51. 3 The word is firmare.

Joan Noel's heirs seems now to be annexed to the interest of her Sister, represented by that Sister's son, Richard de Harcourt. Lastly we must inquire how it was that instead of being 3 hides, as at Domesday, Weston now involved 4\u00a3 hides? I can give no satisfactory answer to this question. Half a hide, originally in Whixall (near Prees), had perhaps been annexed to Weston, leaving Whixall so much short of its Domesday area. Still a hide ad ditional in Weston remains unaccounted for. I can only suggest that there was some mistake in the matter. When a Manor was exempt from all assessment on its hidage, that hidage was not likely to be very accurately remembered. It was, in short, a matter of no import. At the above Inquest of 1255, other franchises were stated to be exercised by James de Audley. He assized beer in his Liberty ; he imprisoned persons taken within his Warren ; and he accepted fees for his Advowry? After this we have many allusions to Weston which are common to Audley's neighbouring estate of Marchamley. Without repeat ing these, I may state, that on the death of James de Audley (II.) , in 1273, Weston, Marchamley, Edgmond, and Ford, realized an annual income of \u00a3107. 14s. 6%d. At Weston the deceased had held 2 carucates in demesne. The heirs of Madoc de Sutton were reputed to be Mesne-Lords of the Manor.2 Again, on the death of Henry de Audley (II.) in 1276, his tenure of Red Castle and two-thirds of Weston is said to be \" under Mar gery and Matilda de Harcourt,3 in exchange for Stanwey,\" and by a rent of ld. payable to them.

There were two Parks in Weston. It was now said to be held of Richard de Harcourt's heir, by a rent of ld. : while Marchamley was held under Fitz Alan for part of a Knight's-fee.1 The Tenure-Roll of 1285 makes an astonishing statement about Marchamley and Weston. \u2014 Under the title, Marchymley, it says,\u2014 \" Nicholas de Audley holds the Manor of Weston with its members, viz. Wexhill and Chirbere, of Robert de Mortimer as members of his Barony of Burford, and he (Mortimer) holds them of the King in capite, for half a knight's-fee. And he (Audley) holds here his free court twice yearly, and has gallows and warren under Charter of Henry III., and has used those franchises for 30 years. The state of this Liberty has not been altered (by encroachment) .\" Now, as regards Marchamley, we know that that was held, then as after wards, under Fitz Alan. Therefore the above extract must be taken to refer only to W'eston, Wixhill, and Chirbury (places near Wes ton). That Weston, with or without these adjuncts, was ever a part of the Barony of Burford is not to be supposed for an instant. The Jury which made this return was probably mystified by some confusion with Badger, where indeed Le Strange's Coheirs had at one time been Tenants of the Barons of Burford. At the Assizes of 1292, Nicholas de Audley's franchises in Mar chamley and Weston were made subject of presentment. The Quo Waranto which followed, I have given under Marchamley. The Inquest on Thomas de Audley's death in 1308, shows that, the de ceased being a Minor, Red Castle was in keeping of the King. It was valued at half a merk, and a Dove-cot which it contained had just the same value. Weston and Wykeshul, including Red-Castle Park (worth 10s.) and a Water Mill (worth 13s.), were extended at \u00a320. 6s. 9d. per annum? The Inquest on the death of Nicholas de Audley (II.) in 1316, masses the Honour of Red Castle in a new way, making all Aud ley's estates in this quarter to be members of Red Castle. Thus not only Quekeshale (i. e. Whixall, near Prees) is disposed of, but Marchamley. Kinstone, Ightfield, Losford, and Gravenhanger, are added to the List.3 The arrangement has its historical significance. The very remembrance of those nominal or petty mesne-tenures, which manorially distinguished these places, wa3 dying out. The Tenant by purchase had the prominent interest.

This extract rectifies a former mistake and shows me that the grants made by Reyner de Lee and his son, Thomas, to Haughmond Abbey were in WTeston near Hodnet, not in Weston near Clun. I refer back for the particulars.1 At the Assizes of 1292 Robert, son of Thomas de Weston, was on the Bradford Jury. Weston Chapel. As a mere Dependency of Hodnet, we must not expect any early notices of this Chapel. Nevertheless it was of some Antiquity. The following Coats of Arms were in the Chapel Windows, in the 16th or 17th century. 1. Quarterly, France and England. 2. Chequy, Or and Az. 3. Gu, a lion rampant arg., crowned or. 4. Or, a spread eagle sa. In the East Window were two kneeling figures, male and female. The dexter or male figure was spurred, the head covered by a cap. The knight wore a surcoat of Arms, viz. Az., a spread-eagle, arg., with a label of 3 points or fretty Sa. Underneath were the Letters Dns Johannes. The Female figure wore a surcoat of arms, viz. Quarterly, per fesse indented or, and gu. Underneath were the letters Dne {sic) Isabella.2 Wixhill. There is some difficulty in distinguishing matters which belong to this member of Weston from those which belong to Whixall, near Prees ; for by an extraordinary accident, the superior Lords of both places were identical, and consequently much of their history was common to both. My impression is that Wixhill (near Weston) was almost uniformly held in demesne by the Lords of Weston, so that Freehold Tenants who obviously took a name from one or other place (Wixhill or Whixall) must usually be assigned to Whixall, which was not thus held in demesne by the Lords of Wes ton, except in the earliest times. The Tenure-Roll of 1285 seems to me to distinguish these two places ; but not very emphatically. The entries are as follows. \u2014 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 274. ** Harl.

I take it that Whixall passed to Guy le Strange under Henry II.'s Charter of Weston, just as much as Wixhill did, though neither are named in the Charter. So also did it apparently descend to Guy le Strange's daughters. * In 1203 we have Richard de Wappenbury (husband of one ofthe said daughters) essoigning his attendance at the Assizes by Walter de Witekeshill ; but it is impossible to say whether this Walter was of Wixhill or Whixall. At the same Assizes Elias de Withekesall and his wife, Edith, had a suit of mort d'ancestre against Ralph de Estleg and his wife, Edith, for a virgate in Sulton ; but Ralph de Estleg being dead, the Court ordered a remanet. Now Soulton (the place concerned) stands about midway between Wixhill and Whixall, so that we cannot say whether the Plaintiff, Ebas, was of the former or the latter. 1 Domesday, fo. 256, b, 2."], [393, "WHIXALL. 349 The Pipe-Roll of 1207 gives Adam de Woxhull as amerced one merk, and Richard de Campiun as amerced half a merk, apparently at some Forest-Assize. The former was perhaps the same person with \" Adam Venator, son of Wulfric de Wikeshalle,\" of whom we shall hear presently. At the Assizes of November 1221 the death of Griffin fitz Jar forth1 prevented process in a suit which Radulf de Lindiseie had against him for a tenement in Wykeshull. The Plaintiff was or dered to get another Writ.2 It is evident that he did so, for the Suit was renewed in January 1222 at Warwick, against Matilda (le Strange), widow of Griffin fitz Jarvord. She then surrendered a virgate in Wykeshull to the Plaintiff.3 A Fine was levied on the occasion, whereby it appears that Ranulf de Lindes' paid 3 merks for Matilda's concession, and was to hold under her, in fee, at a rent of 12d. We next come to \"Adam Venator, son of Wulfric de Wickishalle,\" who, it seems, had an estate in Sandford, but who preferred the son of his sister Alice to the son of his brother Richard. A series of Deeds and Fines, already set forth,4 ended, it appears, between the years 1242 and 1249, in Adam fitz Richard fitz Wulfric of Wite keshale ceding a fourth part of the Vill of Witekeshale to Richard de Sandford, to hold under Richard de Lache at a rent of 21d. We may assume then that at this period Richard de Lacon was mesne-lord, at least of a part of Whixall ; and we shall presently see that assumption justified by fuller evidence. From the Pipe-Roll of 1249 I find that while R. de Thurkelby was in eyre in Worcestershire (this was in January 12495), John de Wytekeshall had proffered a Fine of 10 merks for some Inquest to be holden. His Sureties were Adam, son of Richard de Wyte keshall, and Madoc fitz Yarforth. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 treats Wickeshall as a distinct Manor from Weston, but in so doing speaks doubtless of Whixall near Prees. \" It was half a hide (not the whole hide of Domesday), and William de Lake held it of James de Audley by service of 15d. per annum.\"6 \u2014 One Adam fitz Wulfric de Wickishall, is named in the same Re cord, as paying 4d.per annum to Ralph le Botyler (of W7em) for his Advowry.

The Adam fitz Wulfrie of 1255 was per haps Adam, son of Richard fitz Wulfric, but called by his Grand father's rather than his father's name. At the same Inquest of 1255, Ralph le Botiler of Wem was reported as accepting an ad vowry of 6d. yearly from Yevan de Wickishall. We next find the Baron of Wem obtaining a still more effective footing in Whixall. \u2014 A Fine of Feb. 9, 1256, shows Robert de Alkminton and Margery his wife (Impedients) acknowledging their grant of 10 acres in Wykeshall, to Ralph le Butiller (of Wem) and his wife Matilda, who ostensibly pay a sore-hawk for the grant, and are to pay a glove-rent to the Grantors, and to discharge forensic services.1 After this the principal tenant of Whixall seems to have been Robert de Whixall, holding under William de Lake, who held under Audley. We have seen this Robert de Wynckeshull attesting a Hop ton Deed about 1270. We shall also see him with Petronilla his wife as obtaining in 1276, an estate at Cotes (Cotton near Hodnet). The Feodaries of 1284 concur in stating that William de Laken holds the vill of Wychesale or Wekeshall of Nicholas de Audeley ; and one of the said Feodaries states it to be a member of Weston. It is evident that in both cases Whixall near Prees is the Manor thus distinguished. To return to Robert de VvThixall, William de Laken's presumed Undertenant, I find him sitting on a Wrem Jury in 1284 and on other Juries in 1290, 1292, and 1293. But there were many other Undertenants in the Manor at this period. For instance, about 1284 we have seen Hugh de Steel selling a fourth of Wilkeshall to William de Sanford. Then, about 5 years later, we have Yovan fitz Adam of Wrickeshale selling the tenancy of John, son of John, son of Yovan Campion of Wickeshale, to Sir Ralph de Sandford : the Deed being attested by Philip de Montague and Madoc de Wickeshale.2 About 1290 we have a second conveyance from Hugh de Steel to William de Sanford, of a fourth of Wilkeshal or Quickeshalle. About this time Robert, son of Robert de Weme, was suing four parties for different tenements in Wycheshall, viz. Wibiam fitz Matilda de Wycheshall for a messuage and 3 acres, Madoc fitz 1 JIhe boundaries of these 10 acres are given in the Fine. Among them are the Cross of Richard Scrupe, Northwood bosc, the field of Edestaneston, Le Oldebuttes, the field of Eylburgrene, Le Horehalk, Le Charkingok, Rakenhurst, Shytenhurst, the boundaries between Wemme and Lake, Le Fermbuttesford, Le Longenhaleshurst, Foxeleg-hedge, and Okenhulleshurne. 2 Supra, pages 232-3."], [395, "351 WHIXALL. William of the same for a messuage and bovate, Heylin de Wyches hall for a messuage and 12 acres, and Wyon fitz Madoc of Wykes hall for a messuage and 4 acres. The Defendants were to be summoned to Westminster, and the summonses to be served by Madoc, son of Thomas de Wycheshall, and Thomas de Styele (Steel) ? About 1305 we have Alice, widow of Madoc fitz William of Whixall, quitclaiming property to William de Sanford, whilst Philip de Montacute, John fitz Yevan, and John fitz William, at test her Deed. In January 1308, Philip de Montague and William de Wynekeshull sat on a Sandford Jury. About two years later John, son of Richard de Wyekeshall, grants lands to the above William de Sandford ; the Deed naming Hugh fitz Alan and John de Montacute as Whixall Freeholders, and being attested by Thomas fitz Heylin and John fitz William.2 Coternporary with these per sons was one Roger de Wekineshall who precedes Richard de Lakyn in attesting a Hopton Deed already set forth.3 The above very scattered details suggest a remark as to the great number of persons of Welsh extraction who held small tenements in Whixall. Probably they were first introduced to the Manor by Griffin Gohc of Sutton or his son Madoc. At the close of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century, the Botelers of Wem acquired the mesne -lordship of Whixall, holding under Audley and over the Tenants in general. When the Inquest of January 1316 states that Nicholas de Audley, deceased, had received 6s. rent from a free-tenant in Quckeshale, we may be sure that the said tenant was William le Boteler (II.) of Wem : for, in the Nomina Villarum of March 1316 WTilliam le Boteler is ac tually entered as Lord of Wycheshale.4 In 1369, we have seen that William le Botiler of Wem, died seized of Quixhall, which he held under James de Audley by service of a pair of spurs.5 W7hixall was much nearer to Wem than to Weston, and lay indeed in the midst of Le Botiler's Dependencies. Probably Le Botiler's mesne-interest there had arisen in motives of convenience ; but I cannot say whether it was the same mesne in terest as had previously been held by the Lacons. Whixall Chapel. Of this foundation, however ancient it may have been, we are not likely to have early notices.

It did not, like Cressage, go to re pair the shattered Fief of De Lacy, nor, like Weston and Whixall, to reward the services of Guy le StraDge. The neighbouring Manor of S oulton had belonged to the Chapel of St. Michael in Shrewsbury Castle at Domesday . Whenever or however Lacon es cheated to the Crown, the King added it to the endowment of that Chapel. Some Incumbent of St. Michael's enfeoffed a Toret or a Corbet of Morton, both in Lacon and Soulton. Corbet again in the 13th century had his Undertenants in both Manors, each such Tenant being named after the place of his feoffment. A Suit, which commenced in 1271 and ended in 1272, tells the status of Lacon and Soulton, as far as Corbet was concerned. \u2014 In October 1271, \" Richard de Sarr', Parson of the Church of St. Michael in Shrewsbury Castle,\" impleaded Robert Corbet at West minster, for the purpose of obliging him to render right and cus tomary services for the free tenement which he held under the said Parson in Soleton and Lach : to wit, the Parson complained that whereas his predecessor, William, had been seized, in the present reign (Henry III.'s) of 5s. rent receivable from Robert Corbet, for the aforesaid tenement, Corbet now detained 2s. thereof. The suit had been adjourned to October 1272, and Corbet had meanwhile appealed to a trial of Grand Assize, whether he held by 3s. or by 5s. rent. At the Iter then in progress, Corbet repeatedly offered him self as Defendant in this Cause ; but, as often, Richard de Sarr5 failed to appear. So judgment went for Corbet, by default, i. e. he was henceforth to hold by 3s. rent, not 5s.2 1 Domesday, so. 256, b, 2. 2 Assizes, 56 Hen.

It is, in fact, sup plementary, and has been inserted under Pimhill Hundred because the vellum did not afford the requisite space under Bradford Hun dred. Moreover we shall see that John de Laken did not succeed to Laken till about 30 years after the general date of these Feo daries. I here leave the subject of Corbet's mesne-tenure, and revert to the earlier history of his Feoffees, the Ancestors of the once wealthy family of Lacon. Richard de Lake (I.) occurs in the year 1200, when an amerce ment of half a merk had been set upon him for some act of dis seizin.1 I cannot imagine why Bartholomew Toret, Lord of More ton-Toret, should concern himself about Lacon Mill, unless it was as Mesne-Lord of Soulton and Lacon. Be this as it may, the Deed, from which the following extract was taken, seems to have passed early in the 13th century. \u2014 \" Seiant tarn presentes, fye, quod ego Bertholom\u00e6us filius Petri de Mortun dedi, fye, Ricardo de Laca stagnum molendini de Laca, unde placitum suit inter me et ipsum Ricardum in Curia Domini Re gis.

Alice, her husband, and her heirs, were henceforth to hold the same under Richard de Lak at 12d. rent. The above Richard de Lake seems to have married Gilian, a sister of the first Ralph de Sandford, and to have had with her in frank marriage two virgates in Sandford.2 That the Lacons adopted the Sandford Arms with reference to this match I have already suggested. We have had Richard de Lake acting as Surety for Ralph de Sanford in 1203.3 We have also seen Richard de Lacke attesting a grant in Styche to his presumed Brother-in-law ; and we have seen the same Brother-in-law (Ralph de Sandford) enfeoff ins William, son of Richard de la Lake, about the vear 1230.4 I take this William to have been Nephew of his Feoffor, and younger son of Richard de Lake (I.). Richard de Lake (II.) , in a Deed which proves him to have been son of Richard and Gilian, enfeoffed Richard, son of Robert de Sanford, in the before-named two virgates in Sandford. This was about 1245, and Sir Richard de Sandford (the Feoffor's first cousin, I think) attested the Grant.5 This second Richard de Lake has further been shown to have been Mesne-Lord of Whixall between 1242 and 1249.6 William de Lake, who officiated as a Juror at the Inquest of Bradford Hundred in 1255, was, I think, son and heir of Richard de Lake (II.). He might possibly have been his younger brother, above mentioned ; but if so, he must have lived 50 years after his feoffment by Ralph de Sandford. On this very Inquest of 1255, William de Lake is entered as Mesne-Lord of Whixall, but the Manor of Lacon is not mentioned. At the Assizes of 1256 William de Lake was one of the Elizors for Bradford Hundred. He was also found to have disseized his neighbour, Ivo de Suleton, of cer tain common-pasture in Hawode, which common-right pertained to Suleton. William de Lake appears on a Hodnet Jury in 1257, and about the same time attests a Hopley Deed. In March 1276 William de Lake attended the Inquest on the 1 Newport Evidences. \" Supra, page 228. 3 Supra, Vol. IV. page 48. \u00ab \u25a0 * \u2022 \u00bb Supra, pages 225, 228."], [399, "355 LACON death of John le Strange, and in May 1276 William de Lakey at tended that on the death of Henry de Audley ?

Here then was the first step in the transition from the name Lake to that of Lacon. Laken was the intermediate form. Richard de Lake (III.) comes into notice soon after this. In February 1290 he sat on a Longslow Inquest. At the Assizes of 1292 he was ninth Juror for Bradford Hundred. He was an occa sional witness of undated Deeds from this time till January 1308, and November 1316, when we have him again on local Juries. Meantime we get a most satisfactory proof that the land at Aychley, in Sandford, which had been given about 1230, to AViiliam, son of Richard de Lake,2 had descended to Richard de Lake (III.), and been made over by him, while living, to his son John. About Michaelmas 1315 the latter, styling himself Johannes filius Ricardi Domini de Laken, sets all his land of Achesleye (including two messuages, and all appurtenances within and without the Fee of Sanford) to Robert fitz Wariu of Ercalue ; to hold to the Lessee for a term of 16 years commencing Michaelmas 9 Edw.

A glance at the Map will explain this, but nothing will explain the double, if not treble error, which will hereafter appear to be involved in the Domesday account of this district. Of Mostyn the Record speaks thus. \u2014 \" The same Roger (Venator) holds Mostune (of the Earl). Dodo and Ulgar held it (in Saxon times) for two Manors, and were free men.

As to Ulgar, his name will reappear under Bearstoue and Gravenhanger ; \u2014 both in Odenet Hundred. Any Seigneury which was Roger Venator's at Domesday must, according to the usual rule, be afterwards looked for, as pertaining to the Barony of Pulverbatch. The rule holds good in, and derives a strong corroboration from, the case of Mostyn. One of these Barons enfeoffed a Fitz Warin both in Mostyn and Welbatch ; a Fitz Warin subenfeoffed some head of the kindred House of Hod net. Hence Baldwin de Hodnet was enabled to grant a moiety of his Vivary at Moston to Henry de Audley :3 hence also (as we have already seen 4) on Baldwin de Hodnet's death in 1224, custody of Welbatch and Mostyn, rightly pertained to the Fulk fitz Warin of that period.

The unreality of such appearances will be proved in the sequel. It was doubtless this tenure in Mostyn which caused Odo de Hodnet to be enrolled (about 1240) as Tenant of some part of a knight's fee in Pulverbatch ? by which is meant, that he held something in the Honour of Pulverbatch. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 reduces this theory to demonstration. It says that \" Odo de Hode net holds Moston for two hides (the Domesday measurement) , and pays 8d. for motfee, and holds of the Fee of Pulrebatch, doing ser vice in proportion to a fourth part of a knight's-fee ; and he does suit to the Hundred twice yearly at the Sheriff s-Tourn.\"2 The Inquest on Odo de Hodnet's death in 1284, values Moston at 40s. per annum. A carucate of land and a Mill were the chief items productive of that income. The deceased had held it for one-tenth of a fee under Philip Marmion (then Lord of Pulver batch).3 The Feodaries of 1284-5 follow this statement, except that WTilliam de Hodnet is Tenant of Moston, and the vill is rather inaccurately said to be a member of Marmion' s Barony of Kilpek. Among the numerous acquisitions of Robert Corbet of Morton, was a messuage and virgate in Moston, purchased apparently from Stephen, son of William le Marescal. The Tenement was charged with a rent of 2s. 8d. to WTilliam de Hodnet. On Corbet's death, in 1300, it was found by Inquest that he and his wife had been jointly enfeoffed therein.4 The Fine by which William de Hodnet settled Wrelbatch and Moston on his daughter Matilda and her husband, William de Ludlow, has been given under Westbury.5 This was in 1301. In 1316 the Inquest on William de Ludlow's death states how he and his wife had held conjointly the said vills.6 Here again the mesne tenure of Fitz Warin appears as still existent. \u2014 The deceased had held by the service of one-tenth of a fee not immediately of the Barony of Pulverbatch, but of Fulk fitz Warin. Moston at this time produced 119s. 6d. rent to the Ludlows, exclusive of its Water- mill. 4 Inquisitions, 29 Edw. I., No. 45. 5 Supra, Vol. VIL p. 58. 1 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 120, 196-7. 2 Rot.

Domesday, after noticing Roger Venator's Manor of Mostune, passes to Ludecote, but between the two is a marginal mark corre sponding to an entry lower down the page, which entry shows that the list of Roger Venator's Manors was incomplete, as the Scribe first wrote it, and that Haustone (Haughton) in Recordin Hundred belonged thereto. We have seen that this coeval emendation was really correct, and that a part of Haughton belonged to the Fee of Pulverbatch for ages.1 The next question is as to the Hundred in which the Scribe meant to include Ludecote. I suppose that it should rather follow the Hundred in which Mostune was, than that in which Haustone was. Now, the situation of Mostune was in Odenet Hundred, though the Record omits to state that fact. We must take such omission to extend also to Ludecote, and look for Ludecote in Odenet Hundred.2 We shall find this search a difficult one, and must therefore make the most of every hint which Domes day gives. \u2014 The Record says that \u2014 \" Radulfus Cocus and Thochi hold Ludecote of Earl Roger. Dunning and Sauuinus held it (in Saxon times) and were free. Here are ii hides, geldable. The arable land is enough for in ox-teams. In demesne are 1\\ teams, ii Neat-herds, v Serfs, and i Boor. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 8s. {per annum) ; now it is worth 16s. It was partly waste {i. e. when the present holders obtained it).\"3 We may observe that Tochi was the name of the Lord of Wood cote and Eye in 1086, and that Dunning had been Lord of Spoon ley in the Confessor's reign ; \u2014 but such hints serve nothing, that I can see, towards establishing the identity of Ludecote. The name, Ludecote, and the hidage are all that Domesday else affords for our guidance. We must look for any place anciently called Lude as near a passable part of some Stream or River.4 Places, anciently called Cote, are found afterwards to be usually called either Cotes, Coten, Coton or Cotton, which is but a change from singular to plural, and quite intelligible, when we consider that it probably cor responded with the multiplication of dwellings in any particular 1 Supra, Vol. VIII. pp. 285-6. - Vide supra, Vol. III. pp. 222, 223. 3 Domesday, so. 259, a, 2. 4 Supra, Vol. V. p. 238."], [403, "359 LUDECOTE. spot. Now there is a place called Cotton, standing on the river Tern, and near the spot where the road which passed between Hod net and Stoke (upon Tern) must have crossed that River. This place, I thiuk, represents the Ludecote of Domesday, and I will first prove that Ludecote was, within 50 years of Domesday, called simply Cote.\u2014 King Henry I.'s Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey passed in 1121. It speaks of one hide in the Vill called Cota, which had been given to the Abbey by Tochil. Stephen's Confirmation also in cludes the grant, and calls the Grantor Tochi. Henry II.'s Con firmation, as well as Henry III.'s, confirms Thochi's grant as one of two hides in Cota. Now I suppose that the earliest confirmations are most likely to represent exactly, what portion of Ludecote or Cote the Abbey ac quired under Tochi's grant. We may therefore estimate the acqui sition as half the Manor. That Shrewsbury Abbey does not after wards appear seized of half Cotton, is an argument against the identity I am endeavouring to establish, for I shall show that Cotton remained, in part at least, a Manor, after the period of Tochi's grant, and in other hands than those of the Monks of Shrewsbury. But my belief is, that what Tochi granted to the Abbey was annexed to the Abbey's neighbouring estate of Woolerton, and that the origi nal Manorial distinctions were so far destroyed. A continuous territory thus extending from Woolerton to Cotton will have flanked the Manor of Hodnet on its Eastern side; and to this I attribute the disputes and agreements which were made between the Lords of Hodnet and the Monastic Owners of Woolerton.1 After thus assuming Ludecote to be identical with Cotton, and part of it to have been thus disposed of to Shrewsbury Abbey, and absorbed in WToolerton, we have next to trace, if we can, any evi dences of the residuary Manor. \u2014 As a mere hypothesis I will assume that that part of Ludecote which Radulfus Cocus held at Domesday became an escheat, and that it was annexed to the Fee of Pulver batch. It may have been such a transfer that suggested the mistake, or false analogy, which I have already pointed out, when speaking of the neighbouring vill of Hopton. There De Lacy's escheated inter est was, on one occasion, erroneously deemed to have passed to the same Fee of Pulverbatch.2 It will appear probable that, as in Moston, so in Cotton, the Hodnets became Feoffees of the Barons of Pulverbatch. The grant 1 Supra, page 207.

This does not indeed prove the Hodnets to have been seized of Cote itself, or any part thereof; but it will assist my future argument. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes Cotin as a \"Vill consisting of half a hide. One moiety thereof was held by John de Cotin, the other by Walter Bras. Both held of the Fee of Pulver batch. They paid 2c?. for stretward and 2d. for motfee, and did suit every three weeks to the Hundred. Robert Dios of Cotin-sub- Tune and his two sons, paid a shilling each to Odo de Hodnet for his Advowry.\"2 Here the mesne interest of Odo de Hodnet (II.) is all but suppressed. It fully appears however, in the Feodaries of 1284-5, that the Hodnets were Mesne Lords of Coten or Coten ; for \" Robert de Wynkeshull held the said vill under William de Hodnet, who held under Philip Marmyon, who held of the King, in capite, by service of one-twentieth of a knight's-fee.\" After this, the residuary part of the Manor seems to me to have been as com pletely absorbed in Hodnet as the primary part had been absorbed in Woolerton. I have only to notice in conclusion those of Hodnet's Tenants in this Vill, whose names I can trace. Elyas de Cotes was Juror in a Forest Inquest of 1220. John de Cotin and Walter Bras occur, as above, in 1255. About the year 1270, John de Cotes and Robert de Winckeshull attest a Hopton Deed.3 Johi de Koten super Tern sat on a local Jury in 1274 and again in February 1284. In the latter year Robert de Wynkeshull was De Hodnet's sole Tenant here. This Transfer is well explained by a Fine which had been levied on April 19, 1276. Thereby John de Cotes (Impedient) ac knowledged the right of Robert de Wykeshull and his wife, Petro nilla (Plaintiffs), to a messuage and 3 bovates in Cotes, whereof had been Plea of Warranty. In return the Grantees conceded the premises to John de Cotes to hold for his life, at a penny rent, under themselves and the heirs of Petronilla. The premises were then to revert to Robert and Petronilla and to the heirs of Petronilla.\" \u2014 I suppose that Petronilla was daughter and heir of John de Cotes, and that the latter, having thus settled his estate, died in 1284.

The place was un doubtedly Lee Brockhurst, and so should have been placed in Odenet Hundred.1 A tract of woodland which lay hereabouts was called Brockhurst, and in aftertimes gave a distinctive name to two vills, viz. Lee and Preston. Nor was the distinction needless; for the Shropshire Domesday enumerates six different Manors with the name of Pres ton, and five which are called Lega, Lege, or Lai. Domesday de scribes Lee Brockhurst as follows. \u2014 \" The same Normannus holds Lege (of Earl Roger) . Uluiet and Wictric and Elfac held it (in Saxon times) for three Manors, and were free. Here is one hide, geldable. The (arable) land is enough for n ox-teams. Those (two) teams are in demesne, with mi Neat-herds and i Boor. Here is a Mill of 6s. (annual value) . In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 13s. {per annum) ; now it is worth \u00a33. He (Normannus) found it waste.\"2 Normannus is recorded to have had other dealings with this Manor, besides the great improvement which he effected in its value. He gave to Shrewsbury Abbey the land of Boleley. Now Booley must have been an outlying member of Lee Brockhurst. It is also observable that this grant of Booley is described as made by Nor mannus Venator; a satisfactory proof that the Normannus of Domes day was as well entitled to the name Venator as his brother Roger, though the latter only is called Venator in Domesday. Of Manors noticed in these pages, Lee Brockhurst is now the fourth, in which the Domesday Seigneury of Normannus can be traced to have descended to the Pichfords. This analogy with Al brighton, Bishton, and Cantlop, extends still further, in the case of Cantlop : for, as the descendants of Ulger Venator were Pichford's Feoffees in half Cantlope, so did they claim to have a Seigneural in terest in Lee Brockhurst. \u2014 However, the actual and rightful Tenants of Lee Brockhurst were 1 Vide supra, Vol. VI. page 1. IX. 2 Domesday, so. 259, a, 1. 46"], [406, "362 LEE BROCKHURST. the De Burghs, descended, as I have elsewhere shown,1 from AUce, sister and eventual heir of Engelard de Stretton. This Alice had married Philip de Burgo, alias Philip filius Episcopi, whose real origin is probably indicated in the latter name. Alice survived her husband, Philip, and her son and heir, Bertram. The latter left a widow, Helisant, and an infant son, a second Bertram, whose ward- ship was obtained by his Mother. WThile things stood thus, the In- fant Bertram became a Suitor in the Curia Regis against his Grand- mother, Alice, and recovered from her plenary seizin of two carucates in Legh.2 The time of this recovery is uncertain, but probably it took place before the kingdom was disorganized by the Barons' league against King John. While the infant Bertram was yet in seizin by virtue of the aforesaid recovery, Ralph de Pichford ap- peared on the stage, and, probably as seigneural Lord of Legh, took possession of the estate. In October 1219, a precept (the latest of a Series) was expedited from Westminster, to the Sheriff of Shrop- shire, enjoining him \" to restore the Infant to his estate, and to attach Ralph de Pichford, if Helisant, the Infant's Mother, continued to complain of the said Ralph's intrusion at Legh.\"3 An entry on the same Roll, shows that on November 18, 1219, \" Helisant's Attorney (Robert de Claushall) appeared on her behalf, and on behalf of Ber- tram fitz Bertram, her son and ward, against Ralph de Pichford, concerning land in Lecham.\"4, The Sheriff was ordered to attach the said Ralph, to appear in Court in three weeks of Hilary (1220). \u2014 I hear no more of this Suit ; but entries on the Plea-Rolls of Michaelmas Term 1242, and of Easter Term 1243, show the widow, Elysaunt, as remarried to Robert de Bromlegh, and as holding her dower in Legh under warranty of Bertram de Burgo ; \u2014 her son of course. The said dower consisted of 20s. rent, the Advowson of the Church of Legh, and a third of half a hide, except one virgate. Bertram de Burgo was, on his part, seized of two-thirds of half a hide in Legh. All these parties were impleaded for their respective tenements, by one William, son of Robert de Legh, who alleged himself to have been in seizin of the whole in King John's reign. This claim was probably that of an assumed Feoffee of the De Burghs or Pichfords. It was ordered to be tried by Grand Assize.

And it is half a hide and half a knight's-fee : and it pays 2d. motfee and 2d. stretward per annum, and does suit twice yearly to the Great Hundred.\"1 At the Assizes of 1256, Johu fitz Hugh of Bolas appeared as claiming that relative seigneury over Bertram de Burgo which was actually enjoyed by John de Pichford. In the first instance he em ployed the form of mort d'ancestre, viz. he impleaded the Tenant, Bertram, for 20s. rent in Legh, alleging that some ancestor (pro bably his Father, Hugh fitz Robert) had died in receipt of the said rent. This Suit he did not prosecute. His Surety therein was Richard fitz Syward of Wythiford.2 His second Suit was in the form of a Placilum Servitii. He challenged Bertram de Burgo to answer him as to the said Ber tram's obligation \"to do customs and service for the tenement which he held under the Challenger iu Lega, as in homages, rents, and other things.\" He alleged that, since Bertram so held one fourth of a knight's-fee, he ought to do homage to the Plaintiff, and pay him an annual rent of 20s. ; which services and rent this iden tical Bertram had done to the Plaintiff's Father, Hugh ; but since Hugh's death had withheld the same, thereby damaging the Plain tiff to the extent of \u00a310. To all this Bertram replied that he held no tenement under John fitz Hugh, but that he held uuder John de Pichford, who was in seizin of his homage and service. The Court hereupon dismissed Bertram sine die, but gave the Plaintiff leave to proceed by a Writ-de-recto against Bertram, if he should so de sire.3 In 1256, though Bertram de Burgo was Tenant of 15 librates of lands, the Sheriff of Staffordshire reported him among those who had not taken knighthood. He had a good estate at Wilbrighton in that County, held under Le Strauge of Ness and Cheswardine. At the Forest Assizes of February 1262, it was presented that Bertram de Burgo and his brother, Thomas, were habitual tres passers {malefactores custumarii) on the King's Forest. They ap peared not at first, but Bertram, coming forward at last, was com- on that point. It assumed the Tenancy, and dealt only with the nature and amount of service due thereon. 1 Rot. Hundred.

He procured his liberty and that of his brother and men, by a Fine of v merks, his Sureties being Michael de Mor ton and Ingelard de Acton. I learn from a W7rit of September 2, 1267, that John fitz Hugh had renewed his suit of mort d'ancestre against Bertram de Burgo for 20s. rent in Lega. There were several hearings of this case, but it would appear that Bertram, having called John de Pichford to warranty, was worsted, and appealed. In Easter Term 1270, his complaint was in consideration Coram Rege, viz. that the Assize of mort d'ancestre had been faulty in pro cess. The said process was now to be reviewed, and John fitz Hugh and John de Pichford were summoned to attend in Michael mas Term. After several adjournments, the case was reviewed, coram Rege, in Hilary Term 1272. It appeared from the state ment of Martin de Littlebury (the Judge who had determined the suit of mort d'ancestre), that on the occasion in question, \"Johnde Pichford, being called to warranty by De Burgh, had appeared in Court and desired to know why he was bound to give such warranty ;\" \u2014 that thereupon \" De Burgh had produced a Charter of Ralph de Pichford, John's Father, which Charter gave to De Burgh the vill of Legh-subtus-Brockhirst {salvo forinseco servicio) and all the right which the Grantor had by gift of Richard de Legh, except half a virgate, wrhich the Prior of Worn bridge held : \u2014 to hold to De Burgh and his heirs, under Ralph and his heirs ; \u2014 by render of the ancient service. After this,\" continues Littlebury's statement, \" Bertram departed in contempt of the Court, and did not prose cute his plea (of warranty) against John (de Pichford) . So, at an adjourned hearing of the suit of mort d'ancestre against John fitz Hugh, the Jury had found for the latter, viz. that Hugh, his Father, had died seized ofthe 20s. rent now claimed by the Son.\" \" Thus,\" concludes Littlebury's statement, \" did John fitz Hugh recover 20s. rent, and damages.\" On hearing the above process, the Court of Appeal {i. e. the Coram-Rege Court of Hilary Term 1272) adverted first to the fact that though Bertram had moved for this review of a former process, he was not now present. So the Court ordered that the former decision should stand, and that the Sheriff should levy \u00a39 damages on Bertram's lands. In June 1276, Sir Bertram de Burgo appears at length as a Knight, and as Foreman of a Jury which sat at Hales-Owen. I cannot tell how many Bertrams there were in this succession, nor can I say why, after John fitz Hugh's success in 1272, the"], [409, "365 BOOLEY. mesne right, established by the Lords of Bolas at Lee Brockhurst, does not reappear. \u2014 The Feodary of 1284, says that \"Bartholomew de Burgh holds the vill of Leye subtus Brochurst, of John de Pychford, and the said John of the King, &c.\" . So too the Inquest taken May 24, 1285, as to the estates of John de Pychford, deceased, says that \" Bertram de Burgo held Leye subtus Brochurst under him, for half a knight's-fee.\" Why the Tenure- Roll of 1285 should make Nicholas Pecheford to be Bertram de Burgh's Seigneur at Lye sub Brockehurst, I can not say. Perhaps the Commissioners who drew up the Record, were ignorant of the real name of John de Pichford's heir.1 Whether it was Pichford's Seigneury or De Burgh's tenancy at Lee Brockhurst which passed to the Audleys I cannot say. The Inquest taken in 1299, on Nicholas de Audley's death, seems to have reckoned the Manor of Lega subtus Brockhurst as one of his estates, but the Document is wholly defaced. The Nomina Villarum of 1316, has Nicholas de Audley (II.) as Lord of Leye subtus Brochurst.2 Lee Brockhurst Chapel. The early history of this Chapel is involved with that of the Church of Stanton Hyneheath; \u2014 under which some allusions have been made to this Dependency. The Appropriation of Stanton Church in 1331, left the Vicar of Stanton Incumbent also of Lee Brockhurst, but James de Audley, \" Lord of Lye subtus Brochurste,\" disputed the right of Advowson with Haughmond Abbey, as far as the Chapel was concerned. At length on February 7, 1336, the Baron renounced his claim to the said Patronage and to half a virgate of land, and was thenceforth, \"with Joan his wife, made a participator in all those spiritual benefits which the Abbey promised its Benefactors. The agreement was dated at Red Castle, and attested by Sir William le Botiler, knight; Sir John, son of James de Audley ; Sir William de Ercalewe ; Thomas de Hextane, knight ; John de Lakene ; and Philip de Peninton.3 BOOLEY. I. have already said that Norman Venator, gave this member of Lee Brockhurst to Shrewsbury Abbey. Nothing better shows the falsity of Earl Hugh's spurious Charter to the Abbey, than where it 1 In 1316 thare was a Nicholas de Pich ford of Cantlop (supra, Vol. VI. p. 290) ; but he can hardly be taken as the Repre- sentative of his House. 2 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 397. 6 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 136."], [410, "366 NORTON IN HALES. affects to convey the tithes of Bolelea, as if they were tithes of the Earl's demesne. His less suspicious Charter says nothing about Booley or its tithes; nor did that lost Charter of Earl Hugh, which is partly preserved in Bishop Clinton's Inspeximus, make any such allusion. It is possible however that Norman Venator, before he gave the vill of Booley to the Abbey, gave part of the tithes thereof; for Bishop Peche confirms two-thirds of the demesne tithes of Bole, as arising from the demesne, not of the Abbey itself, but of some Benefactor {de dominicis aliorum)? Henry I.'s Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey passed in 1121. It says nothing about the tithes of Boleleia, but speaks of a small estate {terrulam) so called, as having been given by Norman Venator. King Stephen's Charter repeats the same words, except that instead of terrulam, it says villulam. Henry II.'s and Henry III.'s Charters confirm, de dono Normanni Venatoris, Bolelegam. The acquisition of Booley itself by no means obliterated the ac quisition of its tithes. Between the years 1236 and 1255, the Abbot of Shrewsbury settled the tithes of Booley on Hugh, Parson of Stanton, for his life. Witnesses, Sir Stephen de Stanton then Patron {advocatd) of Stanton Church, Masters Alan Cox and Regi nald Pinzun ; and Henry, Vicar of the Altar of St. Cross in Salop Abbey.2 The estate of Booley came to be held under the Abbey by the Corbets of Moreton. Hence the Tenure- Roll of 1285, says that \" Robert Corbet holds the vill of Boley under the Abbot of Salop, and he of the King in capite, and as within the Liberties of Eyton.\" This last allusion is to the Abbot's distant Manor of Eyton-upon- Severn, which was occasionally considered as the Caput of his Manors throughout a large district.

The Manors of Norton in Hales and Betton in Hales thenceforth formed one con tinuous estate of Shrewsbury Abbey; so that several particulars which relate to Norton and its Tenants have already transpired under Betton. Other particulars are as follows. \u2014 Stephen de Acleth, whom we have seen attesting a Betton Deed before 1190,3 was identical with Stephen de Ocle, who, in 1203, was on a commission to ascertain the validity of an essoign. He took his name from Oakley in the Staffordshire Parish of Muckleston, but was a Tenant of Shrewsbury Abbey at Norton-in- Hales. A Plea-Roll of Michaelmas Term 1225 alludes to a Suit which Amilla, widow of one Thegus, or Fegus, and now wife of Gregory Pistor, was urging against Stephen de Achel (Oakley) for a third of half a virgate in Norton subtus Lime, \u2014 her dower in respect of her first marriage. Her Essoignor and Attorney was her son, in one place called Reginald fitz Thegus, in another Thegus fitz Thegus. In Hilary Term 1226 the Suit was renewed. Stephen de Ocle did not appear, but Richard de Lache, as actual Tenant of the land, did. His land which had been seized in manu Regis was restored to him, and Gregory Pistor and his wife were ordered to amend their Writ.4 At Assizes, held coram Rege, at Salop, in August 1226, we have Fegh fitz Fegh appearing in a suit of mort d'ancestre against Stephen de Hocle for a whole carucate in Norton.

At these Assizes we find the representatives of the two families at issue. Stephen de Ocle had a Writ de ingressu against WTilliam de Norton and Milisant, his Sister, for a virgate in Norton. The Defendants, it seems, were not joint Tenants, so Stephen had leave to amend his Writ.1 At the same Assizes, Stephen de Ocle, as Tenant of half a virgate in Norton, was impleaded for the same by Geoffrey Ovyet, a minor, as heir of William Ovyet, a Crusader. The question was similar to that in a suit of mort d'ancestre, viz. \" whether William Ovyet was seized, on the day when he left for Jerusalem.\" The Jury found a verdict, proper only to a suit of mort d'ancestre, viz. that WTilliam Ovyet had not died, seized of the premises. So Geoffrey took no thing? In May 1259 Geoffrey, here called son of Walter Ovyet, has another Writ of mort d'ancestre against Stephen de Oclee for land at Norton in Hales. A Hodnet Inquest of 1257 was attended by \" William, Lord of Norton,\" and by \" William fitz Richard of Norton.\" The latter we have seen attesting Tunstall Deeds of the period. In November 1269 Isabella, widow of Richard de Blakenhalle, has a Writ of disseizin, concerning a tenement in Norton, against Stephen de Acle and others. Robert Fulton (the Justiciar ap pointed to try the cause) not having leisure to do so, a second Writ issued in December to Ralph de Hengham. The Assize-Roll of 1272 exhibits William de Northton as a Juror for Bradford Hun dred, and introduces a third or fourth Stephen de Oakley. \u2014 Ranulf fitz Fegh abandoned a Writ de ingressu, for two bovates at Norton in-Hales, against Stephen, son of Stephen de Ocle, and his wife Melisant.

There is no appearance in Domesday of a Church existing here, and I should suppose that in Saxon times the district belonged to the Parish of Drayton. However Norton Church must have been founded at some such early period as will consist with the fact of its having been endowed with the tithes of the whole Manor. This power of arbitrary consecration of tithes hardly existed after the beginning of the twelfth century. Perhaps Herbert fitz Helgot was the Founder of Norton Church, for his Successors at Norton, the Monks of Shrewsbury, were not addicted to such works. A Charter of Bishop Clinton (1129-1148) confirms to Shrews bury Abbey, the Church of Norton with a pension of 2s. ;3 that is, the Monks had the Advowson, and were entitled to the said pension in token that every Rector was their Clerk or Nominee. Bishop Durdent's Confirmation of Churches to the same Abbey, names the Church of Mortuna last.4 Norton must unquestionably be understood. Bishop Peche's, and Archbishop Peckham' s, Con firmations say nothing about any Church of Mortune, but specify that of Norton, with its pension of 2s.5 The Taxation of 1291 mentions the Church of Norton-in-Hales, as being in the Deanery of Newport, but does not assign its value. It refers merely to the pension of 2s. receivable therefrom by the Abbot of Shrewsbury.6 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth merely rate the Parish of Nor ton-in-le-Halys at 2 merks to the current tax.7 They evidently knew of no Taxation of the Church. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of Richard Wordeley, Rector of Norton in Hales as \u00a36 per annum, less 6s. 8d. for Procurations, 2s. for Synodals, and 2s. for the, still exacted, Pension of the Abbot of Shrews bury.8 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

From a Fine of October 29, 1227, it appears that Henry, Abbot of Salop, had given half a virgate in Drayton to Richard fitz Ralph, but being unable to warrant it, was obliged to restore it to Wr alter fitz Ralph, another claimant, who was henceforth to hold it of the Abbot at a rent of 2s. The Abbot further bought off Richard fitz Ralph's claim to this, or an equiva lent, warranty by payment of 3 merks. It appears from a Deed in the Salop Chartulary, undated and unattested, that Richard fitz Ralph held also a virgate in Minor Drayton, by grant of his father Ralph, and that this tenement descended to Richard, son of Richard, and grandson of Ralph. The younger Richard, so describing his title, acknowledges that he and his heirs are to pay 6d. rent to the Abbey, annually at Martinmas, for this tenement.1 I cannot be sure whether the following Fine relates to Little Drayton or to Market Drayton. In Trinity Term 1243, William de Drayton, Tenant of one carucate in Drayton, surrenders the same to Robert de Drayton (Plaintiff). The latter then settles it on William and the heirs of his body, to hold of the Lords of the fee. In default of such heirs there is a remainder to Robert. Possibly this was the Robert de Drayton whom we find as a fellow-surety with Odo de Willaston in 1236, and who occurs on a Hodnet Inquest in 1257. An Inquest held on June 13, 1259, found that William de Up pinton, deceased, had held two virgates of land in the vill of Dray ton subtus Lyme, by a rent of 8s. payable to the Abbot of Salop. The tenement was worth 16s. 8d. per annum? and, I may add, must have been a half of the Abbot's estate in Little Drayton. I cannot trace this tenancy to the Burys of Uppington, the said William's descendants. The Tenure-Roll of 1285 divides the vill of Parva Drayton. \u2014 Half was held by the Abbot of Salop, and accounted a member of Betton. The other half was accounted a member of the Barony of Wem and was held by William de Drayton under the then Baroness of Wem. This last statement was a little more and a little less than the truth.\u2014 No part of Little Drayton was a member of the Barony of Wem : but it so happened that the Barons of Wem were the Abbot of Shrewsbury's Tenants of half the Manor, and William de Drayton was their Undertenant. This is fully explained by a later Inquest, where a Baron of Wem was found 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 95. 2 Inquisitions, 43 Hen.

The Feodary of 4284, known as Kirby's Quest, makes Bardeston not only a member of Chetwynd's Fief, but actually a member of Chetwynd itself.5 Probably this was because the Chetwynds held it so exclusively in demesne.

Thereby he and his successors constituted one of the greatest Baronial Houses of the Palatinate. His Cheshire Manor of Wich Malbank long memorialized his name,3 and it is one of the very few instances in which a Domesday Norman can be said to have stamped such an impress on an English locality. I am far from proposing to give any extended account of a Barony, whose history is so little associated with that of Shropshire. Suffice it to say, that William Malbanc, the Domesday Baron, was succeeded by his son, Hugh, who, in or about the year 1134, founded the Abbey of Combermere, one of the oldest Cistercian Houses in the Kingdom. Hugh Malbanc was succeeded in turn by his son \u2014 e William Malbanc (II.), who greatly increased his fatheWs foundation of Combermere.

About these Ladies and their respective marriages there exists a strange confusion.2 I have here to speak of Alienore, alleged hy some Genealogists to have been the wife of Henry de Audley. Her husband however (the only husband of whom I can find authentic notice) was Robert Bardolf, as the two following Deeds will mani fest. \u2014 \" Robert Bardulf, for the souls' health of his father, mother, and of William Mauban, gave to Lilleshull Abbey one place of land in Wich, whereon to make one free salt-pit of twelve plumbs ,- \u2014 upon the bank, near the salt-pit of Ralph Rufus and of Matthew Mono clus. He gave it free of all toll.\" Again, \" Alienor, daughter of William Mauban, in her proper power, for the love of God and for the health of Robert Bardulf, her husband {domini mei), gave to the same Abbey a free salt-pit, with twelve plumbs in Wich ; \u2014 that salt-pit, namely, which Robert Bardulf, her husband, had confirmed.\" This Alienor is said by some authorities to have died without issue, and I quite concur in such a probability. It was as a Widow, I presume, that she gave to Henry de Alditelegh all her lands in Cheshire, within the Lyme. This Deed was dated on \"Tuesday before St. Mark's day, in the seventh year of the Interdict,\" a date equivalent to April 22nd, 1214.3 Now I have little doubt that Gravenhunger came to the Audleys by some grant similar to the above, and vouched by one or other of the Coheirs of Malbanc. That it was held under the Audleys in the 13th century, will fully appear in the sequel. At present we turn to notice the first recorded Feoffee or Tenant of the Manor. \u2014 1 Rot. Pip., 2 Ric.

James de Audley was called to war ranty by the Defendant, and proved, not only that one Edelina held a third of the premises in dower, but that Agnes was not Adam le Venur's heir, for she had been born long before the said Adam had married her mother. The Jury found accordingly, but allowed that Adam le Venur had died seized of the premises.3 Again, at these Assizes, one Augnes, as widow of Thomas fitz Richard recovered her dower against several tenants in Graven hunger, viz. thirds of 60 acres against Roger de Loskesford, of 22 acres against Robert de Ocle, and of 1 acre against Ralph le Taylur.4 At Westminster, in Michaelmas Term 1266, Jubana, widow of Robert de Aldithelegh, sued Hugh de Frodesham for 20 acres in Gravenhunger, by the process de ingressu. She also sued Stephen de Asseton for an acre there, as her right. The former suit was adjourned, the latter she gained.

In October 1270, Lucia, widow of Richard de Gravenhunger, has a like writ against Stephen de Aston and others. In October 1271, Adam fitz Richard of Gravenhungre had a Writ, adjuratam capiendam, against Stephen de Aston.1 The Plea-Rolls give but slight evidence of the procedure in the above cases. In Easter Term 1271, and Hilary Term 1272, the widow Lucia's suit against John de Baskervill was adjourned. It was for seizure of certain corn of the Plaintiff's. Meanwhile other Suits than those authorized by the above Writs were in progress. In Easter Term 1271, Milierna (Meyler) de Waure and his brother John appeared against Adam de Herlaunde, concerning a messuage and bovate ; \u2014 against Robert le Carpenter and Juliana his wife, concerning a messuage and bovate ; \u2014 and against Lucia, widow of Richard de Gravenhunger, concerning a messuage and bovate, all in Gravenhunger. These Suits were ad journed at Westminster, a third time, in Hilary Term 1272. Then also arose a new suit wherein Adam, son of Richard de Graven hunger impleaded Henry, son of Henry de Mers, Alan de Asseleye and Juliana his wife, and Stephen de Aston, for his right in five small parcels of land in Gravenhunger. At the Assizes of 1272 a suit of mort d'ancestre, concerning a messuage and virgate in Gravenhunger, terminated in favour of Robert de Ocle who had been seized thereof three years before the death of Thomas, son of Richard Godrich, the ancestor, whose seizin on the day of his death was in question. Robert de Ocle had since enfeoffed the present Tenants, viz. Richard le Theyn and his wife Alice. The Plaintiff was Dionisia, wife of John Jeon, and sister, and alleged heir, of Thomas, son of Richard Godrich. It is obvious that a part at least of the above suits coexisted with some very ramified Coparcenery among the Tenants of Gravenhun ger. The Tenure-Roll of 1285 corroborates this, when it states that \" Richard de Loskesford and his Coparceners hold Granhunger 1 I am not clear about the object of the Writ ad juratam capiendam.

The Seigneury of the Audleys at Gravenhunger is apparent in most of the Inquests, taken as to their estates ;\u2014 for instance, Wil liam de Audley, deceased in 1282, had 5s. 8d. per annum from this Manor; and the rents of Nicholas de Audley (IL), deceased in 1316, were 5s. l\u00b1d.

We conclude therefore that it became involved with that Manor at a very early period, though the small addition, thus made to the hidage of Gra venhunger, escaped notice at the Inquest of 1255. A farm-house at the extreme east of the township of Graven hunger, and Parish of Woore, is still known as Onneley Hall, and some portion of an adjoining road as Onneley Lane.

The names of tlie Tenants seldom occur, but, in 1255, they were four Coparceners, viz. Richard de War' had one moiety of the Manor, while Robert fitz Meiler, Richard Thein, and William fitz Adam had the other moiety. The Manor was still reputed to be one hide, and to be of the Fee of Mauban. It did suit every three weeks to the Hundred, and paid 4d. for motfee and 4,d. for stretward? Richard de Waure, the chief of these Coparceners, was one of the Jurors who made tbe return. He was also a Juror at the Assizes of 1256. Meyler and John de Waure, who occur in 1271, were, I think, sons of the above Richard, who was living in 1271. Richard le Theyn, who occurs, with his wife Alice, in 1272, was probably son of Richard Thein above mentioned. John and Robert de Wouere sat on a Wem Jury in January 1284, the latter being, I think, identical with Robert fitz Meyler. In this case he must have died within the year, for in the Feodaries of 1284-5, the four Coparceners of 1255 seem to be respectively represented by Meyler de Waure, by Alice, widow of Robert Meyler, by Richard fitz Richard, and by Richard fitz William. But a new fact transpires in these Rolls, viz. that Katerine de Wervelleston stood mediate between these Coparceners and Nicho las de Audley. Who this Lady was, I have not been able to dis cover. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, William Meyler is alone entered as Lord of Wouere. He was probably son of Meyler, last mentioned, but I cannot suppose the other Coparceners to have abandoned the Manor. Parochially, Woore is in Staffordshire, and forms a Chapelry of the great Parish of Mucklestone. The said Chapelry includes five of the Domesday Manors of Shropshire, viz. AVoore, Graven hunger, Onneley, Bearstone, and Dorrington. The Valor of 1535 does not distinguish this Chapelry from the Mother Church. If the Chapel was existent at that, or any earlier period, its dependence upon Mucklestone was too implicit for its Incumbents to be named in the Diocesan Registers. 1 Domesday, so. 257, b, 1. 2 Rot.

After this nothing can be more distinct than the histories of the two Manors, and nothing more strange than tbe destination of Dorring ton. It went to Wenlock Priory, by whose gift, or at what period, it were almost vain to conjecture. The loss of every clue to the transfer, perhaps points to a very early date, and perhaps suggests oue ofthe Malbancs themselves as the Giver. The Lords of Willey were in some sort Tenants of the Monks of Wenlock in respect of Willey. They became so, absolutely, at Dorrington. I will now arrange a few particulars about the Tenants who held Dorrington under De Wililey. One of these Tenants, Roger fitz Adam, was a Cadet of the House of Chetwynd. Now the Chet wynds were Seigneural Lords of Bearstone, near Dorrington, and were also, in some sort, Seigneural Lords of Willey. It was con sistent with such an influence, local and personal, that a Cadet of the Chetwynds should obtain ingress at Dorrington. We have seen this Roger, son of Adam de Chetwynd, obtaining one side of a watercourse or stream which divided Gravenhunger from Dorrington, his object being to erect a Mill.2 We will now show how he obtained a continuous right on the other, or Dorring ton, side of the stream, for the same purpose. \u2014 \" Roger, son of Richard de Dorinton, gave to Roger, son of Adam de Chetewind, his part of the Duit which divided Dorinton from Gravenhunger, and leave to erect a Mill, and, upon the Grantor's land, a stank. He also gave his share of Chudelesford-Moor, aud right of common to those who should do suit to the Mill. Neither 1 Domesday, fo. 257, b, 1. ** Supra, page 375."], [424, "380 DORRINGTON. would the Grantor nor his heirs make, or permit others to make, any Mill to the injury of the Grantee's Mill. \" For this the Grantor had half a merk down, and reserved a rent of od., and power to grind toll-free at the proposed Mill, as far as his own House was concerned.\"1 By another, and I suppose, cotemporary Deed, \"William, son of William de Dorinton, gives to the same Roger, son of Adam, for his homage, all his share of the aforesaid Duit, reserving a similar right of grinding toll-free for his own house.\" At this point the Scribe who wrote the Lilleshall Chartulary seems to have confused two, if not three, Deeds together. It cannot have been William who, according to the Rubric of the last Deed, charged the Mill of Chudelesford with 30s. per annum, \" in support of the Pittance of the Lilleshall Canons in their Refectory :\" nor can it have been he, who according to a clause (ostensibly in the same Charter), reserves a power of grinding (next after any corn which might be found in the hopper) such corn as might be wanted for consumption {expensacionem) on the three feasts of the Nativity, Easter, and the Assumption. It seems to me as if Roger de Chet wynd must have been the person who charged the Mill with 30s. rent ; and as if the last clause must have been some reservation on the part of the Canons of Lilleshall. About 1220^30, we have a Nicholas de Derinton, probably of this place, attesting an Ashley Deed.2 An early Rent-Roll of Lilleshall Abbey gives 30s. as annually receivable from Cudelesford Mill, and 2s. from William de Dorin ton. Perhaps this was the William de Derinton, whom the Brad ford Hundred-Roll of 1255 enters as Lord of the Vill. It was one hide, geldable, and \" of the fee of Nicholas de Wileleg.\"3 It paid 4d. motfee and 4d. stretward ; and did suit every three weeks to the Hundred.4 In February 1270, Richard Cok of Derynton has a Writ of dis seizin against Richard de Waure for a tenement in Derynton. Between the years 1275 and 1284, there was a dispute and a settle ment between Lucas, Abbot of Lilleshull, and Adam Coc of Derin ton, concerning the malture of Cudelesford Mill.5 , In Michaelmas Term 1277, Wilbam fitz Adam de Derinton, Lord of Derington, was impleaded by Henry fitz Robert of Derin- 1 Lilleshall Chartulary, fo. 73.

On the latter charge he was in misericordid, but the Statute of Marlborough justified the enclosure, sufficient common being still left.1 In the Feodaries of 1284-5, William de Derynton (probably iden tical with the above William fitz Adam) is entered as Lord of Derynton. He held it under Richard de Harley (the then repre sentative of De Wililey), who held it under the Prior of Wenlock. In June 1299, one Henry de Derinton fines to have some trial at law, but possibly he was of another place. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, a William de Deorinton again stands as Lord of this Vill.

This Manor stands first of a series of four which Domesday gives to Nigellus. \u2014 \"Nigellus holds Eldredelei. Edric held it (in Saxon times), and was a free man. Here are m hides, geldable. The (arable) land would employ 6^ ox-teams. In demesne there is one team, and (there are) n neat-herds and mi Villains with one team. Here are two Hayes. The value of the Manor was and is 15s.

As to Edric, such a person either owned or shared in the Con fessor's reign, six Manors of Odenet Hundred. In one instance (that of Weston) he is described as Edric Salvage, in the five others, merely as a, free man. The same person, viz. Edric the Forester, is probably alluded to in all six instances. I have elsewhere given an undoubted case, where Domesday speaks of that illustrious Saxon as nothing more than a free man.2 In the same Chapter I have spoken of his antecedents and career. I now pass to Nigellus, the Domesday Lord of Adderley, Shav ington, Spoonley, and Cloverley. This Nigellus has been identified by some with Nigel de Stafford, the reputed brother of Robert, first Baron Stafford, and the undoubted ancestor of the Gresleys.3 I must bespeak for our Shropshire Nigel a position far inferior both in its antecedents and its consequents. He was a Clerk, and a Physician, Physician indeed to Earl Roger de Montgomery himself. In seven instances, already enumerated or alluded to,4 he succeeded Derbyshire estates of Nigel de Stafford. Drachelauue (Drakelow) was ainong them, 1 Domesday, fo. 259, a, 1. 2 Supra, Vol. III. p. 48. 3 Domesday (fo. 278, a, 1), treats of the 4 Supra, Vol. V. pp. 207-209. 1 X."], [438, "2 ADDERLEY. to the benefices of Spirtes, a Saxon Priest. This was in his spiritual capacity. The compact estate of four Manors, which he held under Earl Roger in North Shropshire, would probably have descended, as a lay-fee, to his heirs, if heirs he had had. I should here observe that a lay-fee in Staffordshire, consisting of the three Manors of Thorpe, Morton, and Kingsley,1 and held in capite of the King, by Nigellus, was much more probably the Fee of Nigel de Stafford than of Nigel the Physician. Now there can be no doubt that Nigel the Physician died in the time of Earl Hugh, and that his estates in Shropshire escheated to the said Earl. Adderley, Shavington, Spoonley, and Cloverley, were now consolidated into one Manor, of which Adderley was, for two centuries at least, reputed to be the Caput. The whole seems to me to have reached the hands of King Henry I., as an Escheat of Earl Robert de Belesme, and to have been granted by the said King to that Alan de Dunstanvill, who has been already ascertained to have acquired the great Manor of Idsall, and probably by a similar process.2 Under Idsall (now Shiffnal) I have traced the descen dants of Alan de Dunstanvill, and the general history of their Shropshire Fief. It now remains to give whatever is peculiar to their Seigneury over Adderley and its members. Between the years 1175 and 1190 Walter de Dunstanvill (I.) made a Park at Adderley. His agreement thereupon with the Abbot of Shrewsbury has been already given.3 I have alluded to the fact of Walter de Dunstanvill (II.) having allowed the Canons of Haughmond a right of transit through his Manor of Adderley.4 In the language of the original Deed he allows the Canons transitum per medium passagium meum de Ad durley, eundo et redeundo versus Le Wiche et alibi in agendis suis de et in omnibus qu\u00e6 cedent eis in proprios usus per jur amentum fratris sui vel alicujus de propria familid ; that is, the uses which the Canons were to make of this privilege were to be strictly con fined to things intended for their own consumption, and a brother of their House, or one of their retainers, was to swear to their honest dealing in the matter. The great territory of which we are speak ing was probably crossed at the period by only one good road, and whoso passed was amenable to the exactions, or dependent on the mercy, of the Lord of the Fee. 1 Domesday, fo. 250, b, 2.

Among the rest, William fitz Ralph, of Blancmunster, his tenant at Calverhall (or Cloverley), was to supply 10s., and Henry de Shavington was to supply 5s. to wards the total. These two sums were of course their respective rents, or parts of their rents, to Dunstanvill himself.1 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 speaks of Adderley, then held by the third Walter de Dunstanvill, as follows. \u2014 \" Sir Walter de Dunstanvill is Lord of Addirdel, and holds in capite of the King, and does to the King the service of one Knight for Addirdel and for Ydeshall, and does suit to the county. The Seneschal attends the Hundred-Court twice yearly at the Sheriff's Tournes, and there demands (liberty to hold) his own free Court. The Manor is 44- hides, and does no suit to the Hundred, the Jurors know not by what warranty of exemption.\"3 ' When Adderley is thus computed to contain 4^ hides, the total will exactly correspond with the total Domesday hidage of Adderley, Spoonley, and Shavington. Calverhall (containing If hides) is thus practically excluded from the computation ; yet there is no doubt that Calverhall was still a member of Dunstanvill's Fief. The Tenure-Rolls of 1284\u20145 are much more satisfactory on this point. Their joint evidence is that \" John de la Mare, through Petronilla his wife, holds the Manor of Adredeley (or Aduiiey) with its mem bers, to wit Schenton (Shavington), Chalverhall, and Sponeley, of the King, in capite sine medio, by service of one knight's-fee. Here the said John holds his free Court twice yearly, and determines pleas of bloodshed and hue-and-cry. The Jurors knew not his warranty, but these franchises have been in use for long time. Of the aforesaid members, Henry de Schenton holds Schenton under John de la Mare ; and William de Calverhall holds Calverhall under Bogo de Knovill and his wife Alianore, who hold under the afore said John.\" A Charter, dated at Aberconway on June 14, 1283, allows John de la Mare to hold a Market on Mondays at Bradewelle, Essex , and, with Petronilla his wife, to exercise Free- Warren in their demesnes at Alderley and Ideshall (Shropshire) and at Iselham (Cambridgeshire) . At the Assizes of 1292 John de la Mere was presented as exercis ing free-warren in Adredelegh, as well as the other privileges above- 1 Supra, Vol. II. p. 333. '-' Rot. Hundred.

He came forward and showed that he held Adderley by courtesy of England {per legem Angli\u00e6), and that the heir, William de Montfort, was a Minor.1 I have spoken under Idsall of the great purchase made by Bartholomew de Badlesmere of the estates of William de Montfort. The transaction was completed by a Fine, levied at Westminster on October 6, 1309, between Bar tholomew de Badlesmere, Complainant, and William de Montfort, Deforciant. After the death of John de la Mare of Bradewell, Tenant for life by custom of England, the reversion of the following Manors was ceded by Montfort to Badlesmere, viz. Ideshall and Addredele, in Shropshire, and Cumb, Colerne, Heghtredbury (ex cept a messuage and 2 virgates), Sterte and Hurdecote, in Wilt shire. The whole were to be held by Badlesmere immediately of the King, by whose precept the Fine was levied. John de la Mare was present, and, as tenant for life, did fealty to Badlesmere. The latter paid Montfort \u00a31,000 for the grant.2 On August 12, 1315, King Edward II. , being at Thunderley, ex pedited a Charter, whereby Bartholomew de Badlesmere was em powered to hold two weekly markets, on Mondays and Fridays, and two annual fairs ou the vigil, day, and morrow, of Trinity Sunday, and of St. Matthew the Apostle, at Shuffenhale; also a weekly market on Thursdays, and a Fair on the vigil, day, and morrow of St. Peter and St. Paul (June 28, 29, and 30), at Aderdeleye, and a Market on Mondays at Castlecombe. On the same day the King granted to Badlesmere a Charter of Free- Warren in Ideshale, Ader deleye, Sponleye, Calverhalle, and Shavynton.3 In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, Bartholomew de Badlesmere duly appears as Lord of Aderdeleye. Six years afterwards he fought on the rebel side at Boroughbridge and was taken prisoner. His subsequent attainder and execution are parts of a well-known drama.4 Adderley was at length restored to Giles de Badlesmere, his son ; and, on the death of the latter without issue, it passed to Margery, the youngest of his four Sisters, who carried it to her husband, William Lord Roos of Hamlake and his descendants. Of Undertenants in Adderley I have the following notes. \u2014 At the Assizes of 1256 Robert le Waleys of Arderdel, in Brad ford Hundred, failed in due attendance. At these same Assizes, Vivian fitz Adam, of Addradel, impleaded Stephen fitz Hamon for half a virgate here, alleging that Stephen had no other ingress, but 1 Compare Vol. II. p. 301. - Fines Div.

The Suit failed because Stephen showed himself to be a Tenant-in villeinage under Walter de Dunstan ville. However the Plaintiff was allowedto proceed by some other process \u2022 \u2014 and it would seem that he did. \u2014 On November 12, 1257, a Fine was levied whereby Vivian fitz Adam, tenant of half a virgate in Aldredesleg, surrendered the same to Walter de Dunstan ville (Plaintiff), and received 2 merks. At the Assizes of 1272, Alexander de Adredeleg was one of the Jurors for Bradford Hundred. A Fine of Nov. 25, 1277, shows Alexander de Addredelegh enfeoffing William fitz Alexander (probably his own son), in a messuage and 70 acres in Addredelegh. The Grantor excepts an assart called ABaret, and reserves a penny rent to himself, and the render of all capital services by the Grantee. A sore hawk is the nominal consideration. In 1316 Richard de Sumervill would seem to have been a Tenant in Adderley. ADDERLEY CHURCH. I am wholly at a loss to say what Saxon Church may have been the Parent of the Churches of this district. Adderley with two of its Manorial adjuncts (Shavington and Spoonley) form the present Parish of Adderley, while Calverhall is in the Parish of Prees. Perhaps Prees, great in its ecclesiastical antecedents, was at one time the Parish Chur-ch of Adderley, but proximity would give Market Drayton a better claim to this spiritual supremacy. Adderley Church was founded before 1291, when it stands in the Taxation, as worth \u00a35 per annum} It was not, like Prees, in the Deanery of Salop, but, like Market-Drayton, in the Deanery of Newport. However we know that Rural Deaneries were first formed without much respect to, and probably without much know ledge of, original Parochial boundaries. In 1341, the Assessors of the Ninth, quoting the Church-Taxation of \u00a35, taxed the Parish of Adderdeleye at the same sum, as a fair index of the ninth of its wheat, wool, and lambs.2 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of William Tomson, Rector of Adderley, as J12 per annum, less 14s., for synodals and procurations.3 The Font of this Church is curious, and I imagine ancient, but I can refer it to no specific \u00e6ra. \u2014 1 Pope Nich.

Master Richard de Northampton, Priest, was instituted March 8, 1305, at the presentation of Sir John de la Mare. He died June 11, 1319. Robert le Poer, or Power, Acolyte, was admitted Sept. 15, 1319, having been presented by a Patent of Edward IL, dated at Newcastle upon Tyne, August 1, 1319.1 On his resignation, an other Patent, of April 28, 1330, presents \u2014 John Farndone to this Rectory, King Edward III. then having custody of Bartholomew de Badlesmere's heir.3 Farndone was ad mitted August 1, 1330. He had license for a year's non-residence [studendi gratia) on August 19, 1348; \u2014 and died August 29, 1349 (probably of the pestilence) . John de Asscheby, Clerk, was admitted Dec. 13, 1349, at the presentation of Dame Margaret, Widow of Sir William de Roos, of Hamlake, knight. On Jan. 14, 1354, this Rector had license for a year's non-residence. On May 13, following, he exchanged preferments with \u2014 William Cook, of Newport, Priest, who was admitted to Ad derley at the presentation of Sir Thomas de Hakeston, knight, \u2014 Patron pro hac vice. John de Beyston, Rector of Aderley, had a license for two years' non-residence, on Oct. 20, 1355. However, on January 4, 1370, \u2014 Wiliam Cookes (again, as it seems, Rector of Adderley) ex changes preferments with \u2014 William de Montgomery, Priest, late Vicar of Drayton, who is presented to Adderley by Sir Robert de Roos, knight. Sir John Brette, Rector of Adderley, died in 1407-8, and on Feb. 28, 1408,\u2014 Sir Hugh de Seton, Chaplain, was admitted at presentation of ' the \" noble woman Beatrix, Lady De Roos.'-' 1 Patent. 13 Edw.

Nigellus found it waste.\"1 \u25a0\u00bb Matthew de Shavington, already mentioned,2 was perhaps an earlier Tenant in this Manor than any of the following. \u2014 Henry de Shavington held here in 1219, under Walter de Dunstanvill (II.), by a rent of 5s. On Oct. 29, 1227, a Fine was levied between Henry de Scaunton, Plaintiff, and Walter de Dun stanvill, Deforciant, of 4 virgates in Schaunton, whereof was Plea of Warranty. Walter now acknowledges the right of Henry, to hold in fee, at a rent of 6s. 8d. In return Henry renounced all right in that bosc at Schaunton called Franchehaye, according to the following boundaries, viz. from Hethelhurste Riding to Brocsich; and thence to Risezvrichtebrok. All Shavington wood, outside those limits, was to remain to Henry and his heirs. At the Assizes, during which this Fine was levied, Henry de Savington was amerced 1 merk for unjust detention. He paid the debt in 1229. Henry de Savinton attests a Tunstall Deed about 1240. It must have been the above or a succeeding Henry de Shainton who appears in 1255 as a Juror for Bradford Hundred, and as Security for a Fine set upon Richard Burnell. At the Assizes of 1256, William, son of Peter de Saunton, with drew a suit of disseizin against Henry de Saunton for a tenement in Saunton. His Surities de prosequendo were William, son of Robert de Lak, and Richard, son of Hugh de Kaverhal. In September 1257, Henry de Schaventon was Foreman of a Hodnet Jury, and about the same time he attests Deeds already quoted under Wottenhull and Marchamley.3 Contemporary with this Henry was Reginald de Shavinton, 1 Domesday, fo. 259, a, 1. 2 Supra, Vol. IX. p. 211 bis. 3 Supra, Vol. IX. pp. 252, 275."], [444, "8 SHAVINGTON. surety in a Tunstall Suit of 1256. The position of this Reginald soon after, as first witness of a Wottenhull Deed,1 would suggest that he was, at the time, head of his family. In August, 1267, the Lord of Shavington was again named Henry. Henry de Scainton was impleaded by Robert fitz Gervase, and Felicia his wife, for having disseized them of a messuage and 1 bovates in Scainton. It proved however that the \"Plaintiffs had been in rebellion, and the Defendant had obtained the premises under a precept ofthe \" Lord Edward.\"3 On the Assize-Roll of 1 272, Henry de Shavinton was entered as one of the Coroners of Shropshire. He occurs on a Jury in 1281 ; was living in 1285, but was deceased in 1292, when \u2014 Reginald de Shavington, as his heir, appeared at the Assizes, to answer for his conduct whilst Coroner. At these same Assizes one William de Mere sued Reginald, son of Henry de Schavyngton, for two-thirds of the Manor of Schavyng ton under a Writ De Recto. The Plaintiff alleged that his Grand father, Robert, had been seized ofthe premises in Richard I. 's time, which Robert had a son and heir, William, which William had a son and heir, William, the present Plaintiff. The cause was tried by Grand Assize, the issue being, \" who had the better right.\" The Jury found that Robert had never been seized, as of fee. The Court decided that Reginald should hold the premises quit of Wil liam and his heirs.3 This Reginald was one of the principal Jurors who had to try causes of Quo Waranto, immediately after these Assizes. He oc curs as witness of a Betton Deed in 1294,4 and in 1300 he is entered as Reginald de Chavynthon, on the Jury which then made perambulation of the Shropshire Forests. I can say no more of this family, whose tenancy under the Lords of Adderley was evidently the principal one in Shavington. I recur to notices of some other Tenants. \u2014 On October 27, 1227, a Fine was levied between Thomas fitz Walter, Plaintiff, and Edwin Willaveston, Tenant, of a meadow in Scavinton, which Thomas had claimed by process of mort d'ancestre. Thomas now consented to ratify a grant which Edwin had made of the meadow to Combermere Abbey ; but the Abbey was to hold it under Thomas and his heirs at a rent of 6s.

Robert fitz Gervase of Shavington has occurred above in 1267. As Robert Gervase or Jervys he also occurs on Juries of 1281, 1283, and 1290. At the Assizes of 1292 one Alexander de Shavynton was a Manucaptor for the future appearance of Master Richard de Pilson. The same person was appointed a Collector of a Shropshire Scutage in November 1319, and occurs in 1320. The following suit of August 20, 1313, probably indicates Wil liam de Titteley1 as principal Tenant in Shavington. \u2014 Thomas de Lee, John and Stephen his sons, William Tittenleye and Margaret his wife, William Hord and Robert his Son, Robert Botterel, and John, son of Reyner de Lee, were arraigned for wrongfully disseiz ing Thomas de Titteneleye of 2 messuages, a Water-mill, one caru cate and 3 bovates of land, and 8 acres of meadow in Shavynton, Culshetel,2 and Upton Waters. The cause, was adjourned, but Wil liam de Tittenleye, as sole Tenant of the premises, undertook the whole defence of the Suit.3 \u25a0J^po-onl-e^ \"The same Nigellus holds Sponelege.

In 1219 Walter de Dunstanvill (II.) assigns to Shrewsbury Abbey a rent of 10s., receivable from \"William fitz Ralph of Blanc munster for the Fee which he held under the said Walter in Chal vrehalle.\" Again in 1285 Bogo de Cnovill (in right of his wife Alianore, daughter and Coheir of William de Blancminster) stood mediate between John de la Mare, Lord of Adderley, and William de Calverhall, tenant-in-fee of Calverhall. Those whom I have now to mention will therefore be understood to be Tenants in Calverhall under the Lords of Whitchurch. \u2014 William de Caverhale attests Sandford and other Deeds between the year 1240 and 1250. In 1249 he sat as Juror on a Sandford Inquest.2 In 1254 William de Calverhall or Calverle, proposed to sue John de Verdon and others for disseizing him of a tenement in Calverhall or Calverle. He is consistently entered on the Pipe- Roll of 1255 as owing one merk pro habenda assizd. In 1255 the Bradford Jurors presented that Adam Miller of Calfrehall, and Robert Chof of Claverleg (Cloverley) gave Qd. each yearly, to William de Blancminster for his Advowry.3 At the Assizes of 1256 Adam de Kalverhale and John his son were in misericordid, for having disseized Richard le Fevre, and Alice his wife, and William, son of Henry de Wereslegh, and Agnes his wife, of common right in 32 acres of land in Kalverhall.4 The Father and Son were likewise impleaded for the same wrong by 1 Domesday, fo. 259, a, 1. 3 Rot.

In July 1259 he himself is impleaded by Richard and Alice le Fevre (above mentioned) for disseizing them of common pasture in Calverhall; and it would seem that the Plaintiffs were worsted, for in October following they had a Writ of Attaint against the Jurors in this cause. On November 18, 1275, a Fine was levied, which substantively was William de Calverhale's settlement of an estate on his own son. As William de Calverhale, Senior (Impedient), he acknowledges his gift of a messuage and carucate in Calverhale to William de Calverhale, Junior, and his wife Alina (Plaintiffs, through Alan de Savynton their Attorney) ; to hold to them and the heirs of William, Junior, by payment of a clove-rent to William, Senior, and his heirs, and by performance of all capital services. In 1284 we have Henry de Calverhall on a Hodnet Jury ; but I take it to be the above William, Junior, who occurs as William de Calverhall soon after, and as attesting local Deeds.3 In 1292 the same person, as Manucaptor for Master Richard de Pilson, is called William de Cloverleg. Again as William de Calverhale he occurs as a witness in 1294,4 and as a Juror on the Forest Perambulation of 1300, and on a local Inquest of 1314. In May 1324 he was returned by the Sheriff of Shropshire as a Man-at-arms, and as under summons to attend a Great Council, forthwith to be holden at Westminster. In April 1308 it was ascertained by Inquest that an acre in Calverhale which William, sou of Richard fitz Hugh (a Felon), had held, had been in keeping of the Vill of Calverhale for the King's year and day, and that the Vill was responsible for the profits. It i 3 Supra, Vol. IX. p. 252, 253, 285. I * Ibidem, p. 200. 1 Assizes, 40 Hen.

Soon afterwards we have Thomas de Calverhall attesting a Whixall Deed.2 J^-cmlton, This was one of two Manors, wherewith it would seem that Earl Roger endowed his Chapel of St. Michael, within the Castle of Shrewsbury.3 Domesday does not assign the Hundred of Soulton, but that is determined by later Records. It describes the Manor as follows. \u2014 \" The same Church (St. Michael's) holds Suletune (of the Earl) . Brictric held it (in Saxon times) freely. Here is one hide, geldable. There is (arable) land for one ox-team. Here is half a team. The former value of the Manor was 5s. (per annum) : now it yields 4d. more.\"4 I have shown under Lacon, how in the 13th century both Lacon and Soulton were held under St. Michael's by Robert Corbet of Morton.5 What remains to be said, chiefly concerns the Tenants who held under the said Robert Corbet or his predecessors. On Dec. 2, 1199, Suanilda de Suleton sent Robert fitz Elias and Richard fitz Walter to essoign her appearance at Westminster in a Plea of land, which Ralph the Provost had against her. Owing to her default now or previously, the Sheriff, on Dec. 18 following, seized the land in manu Regis, and reported his act to the Law- Courts in Hilary Term 1200. On Feb. 10, following, Ralph (here called) the Beadle, and his wife, Edith, appeared in Court by their Attorney, Yvo de Suleton, to claim a virgate in Suleton. Suanilda again failing to appear, the Plaintiffs recovered their seizin. It is probable that the above Ralph, called Provost or Beadle, was iden tical with Ralph de Estleg, who was dead in 1203, and whose widow, Edith, was then (as we have seen under Whixall6) impleaded for a virgate in Suleton. 1 Inquisitiones ad quod damnwm, 1 Edw.

The subsequent Tenants of Soulton were probably descendants of that Yvo de Suleton, who acted as an Attorney in 1200. He or another Yvo de Suleton has been seen attesting Sandford Deeds about 1230 and 1245.1 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 puts Suleton down as one hide, paying the proportionate sums of 4d. for stretward, and 4-i. for motfee. Yvo de Suleton, \" Lord of the vill,\" held it of Robert Corbet, and did suit twice yearly to the Hundred.2 Here the Seigneury of St. Michael's was altogether forgotten. In 1256 we have seen William de Lacon disseizing Ivo de Sule ton of a right of common.3 We have also, under Lacon, investigated the terms upon which Robert Corbet remained Mesne-Lord of Soulton and Lacon, after a trial with the Rector of St. Michael's.4 In 1257, 1272, 1276, 1278, and in March, 1281, Ivo de Suleton occurs on Jury-lists. The Tenure-Roll of 1285 says that \" Ivo de Sulton holds the vill of Sulton under Robert Corbet, and he under the King's-Chapel of St. Mary (read St. Michael), in Shrewsbury Castle.\" The latest notice I have of Ivo de Suleton is as a Juror on an Inquest of January, 1301. In January 1308, Thomas de Solton was fourth Juror on a Sandford Inquest. About the year 1310 Andrew de Kendal attests a Whixall Deed as \"Lord of Suleton.\" In May 1319 he was returned to the Parliament at York, as a Knight of the Shire ; Richard and Wil liam de Sulton being his Manucaptors. Later in the year he acted as a Collector of Taxes aud Scutage in Shropshire.5 His position in the testing clause of a Deed dated at Prees, on April 14, 1320, is extraordinarily low for a person of such mark. In July, 1321, he attended a Parliament at Westminster as a Knight of the Shire for Salop, Richard and Walter de Sulton being his Manucaptors. On May 28, 1322, a Royal Commission issued at the suit of Hugh le Despenser, Earl of Winchester, as well as at the suit of the Crown, for trying Andrew de Kendal, who was indicted, with many others, for forcibly entering upon the Manors of Alstanfield (Staf fordshire) and of Roston and Thurwarston (Derbyshire).6 3 \u2022 4 Supra, Vol. IX. pp. 354, 352. 6 \u2022 6 'Parliamentary Writs, IV. 1048. 1 Supra, Vol. IX. pp. 225, 229. 2 Rot.

On the other hand, Whitchurch lies on the extreme West of this part of Shropshire. Its position as bordering on the Marches of North Wales was important, and to that we may attribute its ancient name. The change from Weston to Whitchurch is still more easily accounted for. \u2014 The district was thinly provided with Churches. A Church, probably a spacious one, and built of white stone, was founded at Weston soon after Domesday. Such a thing was wondrous in the eyes of the Marchers. It happened over again at Oswestry ; and so Album Monasterium, or Blancminster, became the names common to two important places in the same County. A word now about Harold, son of Godwin, sometime Earl of Wessex, and sometime King of England. It was fitting that he who as King Edward's Lieutenant, had set his foot on the neck of Gruffyth ap Lewellyn, and who for a time was the reputed Con queror of Wales, \u2014 it was fitting that he should be represented on every part of the Border. But the jealousy of the Mercian Earls probably thwarted such pretensions, and Harold's only Shropshire estate was Weston. Again William de Warren, the Domesday Lord of Weston, had no other Manor in Shropshire but this one. He had Mauors in 1 Domesday, fo. 257, a, 2."], [451, "15 WHITCHURCH. twelve other Counties, but those he held immediately of the King. In many of them he had been preceded .by Earl Harold. His greatest Fiefs were in Sussex and Norfolk. I have traced the origin of William de Warren in a former volume.1 He was Grandson of a Bishop of Coutances. He was Cousin-german to Ralph de Mortimer of Wigmore. He was more distantly related to the Norman Earls of Shrewsbury and Hereford, and to the Conqueror himself. His wife, Gundred, was a daughter of the Conqueror's Queen, by a previous husband. Such were his pretensions and his influence, that William Rufus made him Earl of Surrey. It is singular to fiud a man, of such antecedents and such a destiny, accepting an isolated feoffment in Shropshire, even under his Palatine Kinsman. His nearest estates elsewhere were in Ox fordshire. Chivalry, rather than covetousness, probably dictated his acceptance. William de Warren was called upon to take his post with others on the frontier of North Wales. He accepted the summons, and Weston became one of a series of fortified Castles which thenceforth guarded the Marches. The descent of the Earls Warren and Surrey derives no new light from their association with Whitchurch. As a part of a nation's history it is well known already, and need not be repeated here. Their Seigneury at Whitchurch was recognized for more than two centuries after Domesday, but became at length httle more than nominal. It ultimately vanished under a twofold influence ; \u2014 the greatness of their Vassals, and the statutes which gradually under mined the very essence of feudal tenures by facilitating alienation. The earliest known Vassal of the Earls of Surrey at Whitchurch was a Cadet of their house ; but he does not appear before the elder male line of Warren was extinct, and the honours of the family had been carried by a female to Hameline Plantagenet, a natural brother of King Henry II. This earliest known Lord of Whitchurch was \u2014 William de Warren, better known as William fitz Ranulf. His relation to the elder line has never been ascertained nor, as far as I know, surmised. My notion on the subject is quite conjectural. William, second Earl Warren, he who died in 1135, is stated, on the best authority,2 to have had three sons,\u2014 William, Reginald, and Ralph. William is well known as his father's successor and 1 Supra Vol. IV. p. 196. I \u25a0 William, second Earl Warren, in a I grant to Castle Acre Priory, mentions his son Radulf (Monasticon, V. 51, v.). Also"], [452, "16 WHITCHURCH. the last of the elder male line. Reginald became notorious as Lord of Wirmgay by marriage with its heiress. Of Ralph little has been recorded except his name, and little can be assumed ex cept his \u00e6ra. It is consistent with both to suppose him to have been father of William fitz Ranulf of whom we are now speak ing.1 If so, Ralph himself may have been, in his time, Lord of Whitchurch. William fitz Ranulf (of Whitchurch) must not be confounded with either of two cotemporaries. There was a William fitz Ranulf of Alfreton, in Derbyshire, living in the reigns of Henry II. and Richard I. There was a much greater William fitz Ranulf, a Courtier and Justiciar in the time of Henry II., and who served the high office of Seneschal, or Chief Justice, of Normandy from 1178 to 1200, when he died. Leaving to the notes some particulars about these two persons,3 I proceed with our proper subject. The first sure appearance of William fitz Ralph of Whitchurch is, as William fitz Randulf, on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1 ] 76, when he was Security for the Fine of his neighbour, the Lord of a curious, and undoubtedly genuine, Charter to Lewes Priory, by the third William, Earl Warren (Monasticon V. 14, No. ix.), mentions his brothers Radulf and Reginald. Both attested the Deed, and Radulf took part in that symbolic process of investiture by which the Monks were put in seizin of the things conveyed, \u2014 viz. \" Hem-y Bishop of Winchester cut a portion of hair from the head, not only of the Grantor, but of his brother Ra dulf, before the High Altar of the Church of Lewes, at the time of the donation.\" 2 Robert fitz Ranulf, father of William fitz Ranulf of Alfreton, and Sheriff of Derbysliireand Nottinghamshire, seems to have been one of those who were discharged from their Shrievalties for misconduct ; \u2014 as exposed by the famous commission of Easter 1170. At all events it was not death which caused his retirement at that particular juncture, for he survived the murder of Becket (December 29, 1170), and lived to found Beauchief Abbey in memory of the Martyr. This will guard us from supposing that William fitz Ra nulf, Robert's immediate Successor in the Shrievalty, was his son, above mentioned. The new Sheriff was quite a different per son. He held his office as Sheriff from the summer of 1170 till Michaelmas 1180, discharging it in 1178, 1179, and 1180, by Deputy. Between 1170 and 1178 he is constantly found attesting Deeds of King Henry II. Out of ten such Charters I find three in favour of Shropshire Monas teries ; but this is a mere accident and must not lead to the idea that William fitz Ranulf of Whitchurch was the Wit ness. The Courtier and actual Witness was also a great Justiciar. He began with It would seem that Radulf was the second brother. His appearance at Lewes on the occasion of the above grant must have happened between the years 1142 and 1147. 1 It is nearly certain that Ralph de Warren, the brother of the third Earl, had a son WilHam. The following consecu tive sentences occur in a recitatory Charter of the Monks of Lewes. \u2014 In Norfolcid. \u2014 Ad LEstunam Rannulfus de Warenna dedit nobis unam virgatam terras.

In thesauro liber avit. Et Quietus est .* \u2014 that is, William fitz Radulf of Shropshire, having a Norfolk Lawsuit on hand, wished it to be tried on the spot. Doubt less he had some feoffment in the large estates of the Earls Warren in the latter County. I next recur to proofs, already given, that William fitz Ranulf was Lord of Dawley in Middlesex, and that he held it under Robert Corbet of Caus. These proofs extend from 1198 to 1201, and show the Tenant to have been skilled in Law.3 I think that he practised in the Law-Courts even more extensively than this evidence would prove, but there may have been a cotemporary Civilian of the same name. His position, as a witness of Robert Corbet's grant to Buildwas Abbey (about 1198), is too high a one for anything less than a great Feudatory.4 Having established William fitz Ranulf's connection with Shrop shire, Norfolk, and Middlesex, I now follow him to a fourth County, viz. Essex. \u2014 Haltesteda (now^Halstead) in Hidingford (now Hinck ford) Hundred, stands as a Manor of William de Warren in Domes day.,5 From May 1199 till Easter 1200, I find continuous notices of a Suit pending between William fitz Ranulf and Richard fitz Peter, concerning a moiety of the Advowson of Halsted or Hausted in Essex.6 The matter was settled by Chyrograph ,- how, I have not inquired. The relevance of the Suit to our main subject consists in the following grant of a moiety of the Advowson of Halstead, by William fitz Rannulf to the Shropshire Abbey of Lilleshall. \u2014 Randulfi, assensu heredum (meorum) Willielmus de Warein filius to the office.

His abortive Charter to Lilleshall was not the only one expedited by William fitz Ranulf of Whitchurch to a neighbouring Monastery. His grant to Combermere Abbey is for the health of himself, his wife, his children, and of Reinald de Warren, and for the souls of his father, mother, and all his ancestors. It seems to have con veyed lands in the neighbourhood of Branklow and Combermere to the Monks, while they released the Grantor from certain claims which they had on places called Choleslune and Leviethelcote. The Grant was attested by Adam fitz Roger, William de Withcbeshale (Whixall), Wion fitz Landes, Philip de Erdentone, and William Clerk.2 The Charter must have passed before the year 1186, inas much as William Malbanc, whom it names as an adjoining land owner, was then deceased. In the year ending Michaelmas 1199, Geoffrey fitz Piers (Chief Justice of England) had issued a Writ to the Sheriff of Shropshire, under which the said Sheriff furnished 10 merks, out of the Crown revenues in his hand, to William fitz Rannulf \" for the repair and emendation of his Castle of Album Monasterium.\" At this point the means of tracing the succession of the Lord ship of Whitchurch leave me. During the Shropshire Assizes of October 1203, William de Blancmuster sent an Essoignor, Hugh Harun, to excuse his attendance. A Patent of June 10, 1213, orders Robert de Vipont to give up Oswestry, Shawardine, and Eggelawe Castles to John Marescall, who is forthwith to consign the last-named Castle to William de Albo Monasterio.

I cannot think that he was identical with Wil liam fitz Ranulf. I must quote other documents with similar uncertainty. \u2014 A grant to Stanford Nunnery (Lincolnshire), which I suppose to be by the fifth William, Earl Warren, and so to have passed between 1202 and 1240, is attested by Radulf de Albo Monasterio} Again a Writ of November 1217 shows one William de Albo Monasterio to have been disaffected, but to have returned to his allegiance. The or dinary precept for restoring his estates is addressed to the Sheriff of Essex.2 In 1219 we have seen the Lord of Whitchurch, or at all events the Mesne-Lord of Calverhall, styled \" William fitz Ra dulf of Blancminster.\"3 On November 8, 1221, a Fine was levied at Shrewsbury between William fitz Radulf, Plaintiff, and William de Blancmustier , Ten ant, of a hide in Le, whereof the former had been claimant under a Suit of mort d'ancestre. He now releases his claim, for 4 merks paid by the Defendant. The testing-clause of a Deed (already given under Broseley4) and which perhaps passed earlier than 1221, gives no clue to the above fine. \" William de Warren and his brother Ranulf\" attest the Deed, but whether William de Warren was identical with the Plaintiff or the Defendant in the Fine, seems problematical. Again in 1235-6 we have had Matilda de Albo Monasterio alias Matilda de Blancminster as Lady of Dawley (Middlesex) .5 She, I take it, must have been widow of some Lord of Whitchurch. On March 8, 1238, the Lord of Whitchurch at length occurs with a sure mark of identity. As William de Warren de Albo Monasterio, he is summoned by a Writ Close to attend the King at Oxford on April 20th following, there to confer on the truce with Wales, which*would expire in a few months, and on the atti tude assumed by Lewellyn, in causing his sou David to receive the homage ofthe Welsh.6 On April 1, 1240, William Plantagenet, sixth Earl Warren, was deceased, and his son, John, was a Minor, in custody of the King. Coincidently his Tenant at Whitchurch, viz. William de Warren de Albo Monasterio, died, leaving a son and heir, William, of full age. The latter, at this juncture had of course to fine with the Crown 4 Supra, Vol. II. p. 14. 6 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 14. 1 Monasticon, IV. 263. - Claus. I. 375. 6 Rot. Claus. 22 Hen.

His Fine was 20 merks, and it se cured the King's Writ to the Sheriff of Shropshire ordering his investiture in his late Father's estates ; but the Sheriff was to re tain the Castle of Album Monasterium till further orders.1 An Essex Feodary, drawn up about 1241-6, gives William de Blancmoster as Mesne-Lord of Mamged' (probably Manenden), which was held of the Honour of Warren for three-fourths of a Knight's-fee. About this time we have a Whixall Deed attested by Sir William de Albo Monasterio in the first, and by Griffin fitz William in the fifth, place.2 The Lord of Whitchurch and his younger brother (afterwards of Ightfield) are, I presume, here re presented. A patent of March 13, 1253, directs James de Audley, John le Strange, and William Trussel to investigate the following matters, viz. \" who were the persons who had recently slain William de Albo Monasterio, Seneschal of William de Albo Monasterio ; \u2014 by whose orders the Murderers had acted ; \u2014 and who had sheltered or enter tained the said Murderers in defiance of the King's peace.\" Perhaps the following suit, which was pending at Westminster on October 20, 1253, had reference to the affair in which the Senes chal of Whitchurch was slain. The Abbot of Combermere was pro secuting Roger de Barham, William de Sty well (Steel), and Hugh fitz Oweyn, for having, in company with William de Albo Monaste rio, seized the Abbot's cattle. Another and cotemporary Roll places the Suit of trespass before the Queen in Council. Roger de Bor ham and Hugh fitz Oweyn had, it seems, gone, vi et armis, to the Abbot's Granges of Smetheton, Farentil, and Hunnygravej \u2014 had beaten the Abbot's men, &c. \u2014 Here the Sheriff's conduct was censured for not producing the Defendants, who, it was stated, had lands, and might easily be found. All I can further say of this matter is that in Hilary Term 1254, it was in the hands of Brother Anian de Makelesfel, as Attorney for the Abbot. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 is very confused about Whitchurch. It intends, I presume, to register William de Warren (William le Waran') as Lord. The Manor preserved its Domesday hidage (7\\ hides). William de Warren held it under the Earl Warren. He had here his Park, andr exercised a right of Free Warren, by a title unknown to the Jurors.

She had also challenged Robert de Campedeu, Hugh de Graham, Robert de Eyton, and other Monks of Combermere, and William Brun, a servant of that house, for violent conduct (de forcid) . Lastly she had challenged William, Abbot of Combermere, for assenting to, and ordering, the said violence. Now (at the Assizes) the Lady was not forthcoming. The Abbot was found not guilty of suborn ing (de precepto), the others were found not guilty of committing, any violence.1 William de Warren or de Albo Monasterio, Lord of Whitchurch, was deceased before June 11, 1260. A Patent of that date orders James de Audley (he was then Sheriff) to give Peter de Nevill custody of the Castle of Album Monasterium till June 24th fol lowing, \"that in the mean time it might be discussed whether custody of the land and heir of William de Albo Monasterio, lately deceased, pertained to the said James de Audley or to John de Warren\" (then Earl of Surrey). A Patent of June 30, 1260, shows the point settled. John de Warren, as \"Chief Lord of the Fee,\" is to have seizin of the Castle of Album Monasterium ; so however as that Bertreia, eldest daughter of the deceased, should remain in such seizin of the afore said Castle as she had when it was delivered to the Justice of Eng land. (The latter was acting as Viceroy, the King being abroad.) Another Patent of July 23, 1260, shows that James de Audley and John de Warren were at issue about the guardianship of the heirs of Whitchurch, or at least about the custody of some of their estates. Commissioners are appointed to inquire about the disputed custody. In 1272, Alienore, Joan, and Matilda, daughter and coheirs of William de Albo Monasterio were respectively the wives of Robert le Strange, William de Barentyn, and Robert de Brascy. The eldest daughter, Berta, took no part in a suit which her Sisters then had against James de Audley.2 The reason of her indiffer ence is probably connected with her incompetent state. She was 1 Placita Coron\u00e6, 40 Hen.

From a Writ of June 3, 1280, it appears that Ralph de Sand wych (a fiscal Officer of the Crown) had granted a lease of that fourth share of Whitchurch which was in the King's hand by reason of the idiotcy of Bertred fitz William. The Lessee was Bertred's sister, viz. Alianore, widow of Robert le Strange, who was to pay the King a rent of \u00a317. 12s. for the said share of Whit church. The King now ratifies the arrangement.1 I next find Bertred's death announced by a Writ of February 11, 1281, which describes her as Bertreya filia Willielmi de Blancmunster. At the Inquest which ensued, Bertha's fourth of Whitchurch was valued at \u00a317. 12s. per annum. The service by which the Manor was held under the Earl Warren is curious. \u2014 The Lord of Whitchurch was to do duty as the Earl's Huntsman, at the will and at the charges of the said Earl. In Essex the deceased had held, under the same Earl, two carucates at Exstanes-ad-Montem, and other lands and rents in Parva Cavenel. Her whole Essex estate was valued at -\u00a319. 14s. 3d. yearly, and was held by service of one knight's-fee and a quarter.2 The sisters and coheirs of the deceased, all upwards of 30 years of age, are described as Alianore le Strange, Johanna wife of Sir William de Barentyn, and Matilda wife of Sir William (read Robert) de Bracy. I now return to speak of Elianor, originally the second but even tually the eldest of these Coparceners. Of her first husband, Ro bert le Strange, I have given full accounts elsewhere.3 He died about August 1276. A Writ-Close of September 10, 1276, orders the Sheriff of Hampshire to give 30 librates of land and rents in Choulton to his widow, Alianore, till such time as her fair dower should be assigned. Another Writ of October 2, 1276, enjoins the Sheriff of Shropshire to restore the Manor of Whitchurch, and all things which had been taken therefrom since the Sheriff had seized it, to Alianore, widow of Robert le Strange, whose inheritance the King had found it to be.4 Accordingly on the Pipe- Roll of 1277, Bogo de Knovill, the Sheriff in question, \" responds for no issues of the lands of Robert le Strange in Albo Monasterio Warenne,5 be cause he had surrendered them (to the Widow) according to the King's Writ.\" 1 Rot.

Here there is held a free Court twice yearly, with pleas of blood shed and hue-and-cry. Also they have Gallows, Market, Fair, and Warren, by an unknown title. Of the said Members, Nicholas de Audley holds Kempley, and John fitz Hugh holds the vill of Hyn ton under the aforesaid Bogo and Robert.\" John le Strange, eldest son of Robert le Strange by Alianore de Blancminster, has been sometimes styled Lord of Whitchurch, but with great inaccuracy. This youth was born and baptized at Whit tington on September 16, 1266. In September 1287, being then in custody of Anian, Bishop of St. Asaph, he made proof of his age, and had livery of his paternal inheritance.2 Within two years (as I have shown under Wrockwardine) he died without issue. Consequently he was never seized of Whitchurch, for his Mother was living, then and afterwards. At the Assizes of October 1292, Bogo de Knovill was in default as regarded attendance. He and his wife Alianore were presented as exercising free-warren in Whitchurch; and he and Robert de Bracy for holding a Wednesday's Market, an annual Fair, and other franchises in the same Manor. They came forward, and as to the Market they exhibited a Charter thereof, granted by King Richard I. to \" William fitz Ranulph, ancestor of their wives Alianore and Matilda.\" Hugh de Louther followed up this presentment with his suit of Quo Waranto, respecting free-warren, fair, market, ways, and pleas of the crown ; but he only sued Bogo de Knovill (printed Hugo de Ovonill) and Robert de Bracy (printed Bray) and their respective wives. They evaded a direct issue by pleading their Coparcenery with Johanna widow of William de Barytyn, which Johanna was still living. She was summoned from Middlesex to meet the Justices at Lichfield in January 1293. She sent her at torney, and, acknowledging her Coparcenery, joined in her Sister's defence. The question of Market had already been settled, that of Fair was now dropped. As to the other things the Defendants pleaded the \" immemorial usage of their Ancestors ever since the and Kempley.

I cannot determine the precise period of Alianore de Blancmin ster's death. I think she must have been living in 1301, for her husband on February 10, 1301, signed the Barons' Letter to Pope Boniface as Bogo de Knovill, Dominus de Albo Monasterio, and his signature was followed by that of his Stepson, Fulco le Estraunge Dominus de Corf ham, \u2014 titles which were, one of them inapplicable, the other insufficient after Dame Alianore's death. However the Lady was deceased before June 1306, as we shall presently see. My object in thus endeavouring to establish the proximate date of her death is with reference to her Monument. She was buried by some extraordinary chance at High Ercall. Her Monument consists of a slab of grey marble, sometime inlaid with a fleury cross and two shields of Arms, but the brasswork of these is gone. Her Epitaph remains. \u2014 Dame Alianore Lestrange de Blanc- MISTER GIST ICI. DlEU DE SA ALME EIT MERCI. Bogo de Knovill survived his wife, but, not having had issue by her, retained nothing of her inheritance. He probably retired to his estates in Gloucestershire. His latest Summons was to a Par liament to be holden at Carlisle on January 20, 1307. King Ed ward's Writ of Diem clausit announcing his death bears date at Burgh on the Sands, July 6, 1307.2 Meantime Fulk le Strange, second son, and now heir, of Robert and Alianore, was seized of one-third, and had purchased the rever sion of another third, of Whitchurch. A Fine was levied on June 12, 1306, whereby Robert de Bracy and Matilda his wife (Plaintiffs) allow their gift of one-third of the Manor of Whitchirche- Warrene to Fulco le Estraunge and his wife Alianore (Deforciants). The latter restore the premises to the Grantors for their lives, \u2014 to hold by payment of a rose-rent, and by render of all capital services ; \u2014 with reversion to Fulco and Alianore and the heirs of Fulco. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 Fulco Extraneus is entered as sole Lord of Album Monasterium. At his death in January 1324 the Inquest found him to have been seized of the whole Manor. He had held it of the Earl Warren, \" by service of taking the venison throughout the Earl's lands in England, at the charges of the said Earl.\" \" The Manor of Whitchurch was charged with a rent of 10s. per 1 Quo Waranto, pp. 680, 720. 2 Rot.

ALKMOND. 25 annum payable at Lady-Day and Michaelmas, and a rent of one sparrow-hawk, or 2s. payable on August 1, to the King's Manor of Aderdeleye.\" This was perhaps for Calverhall. Also Fulk le Strange had charged one of his four Mills with a life annuity of 6 merks in favour of a certain Richard de Ley lond.1 An Inquest of July 12, 1324, shows the latter payment to be questioned by the King, probably as Guardian of Fulk le Strange's heir. It was however found that Richard de Leylonde was seized for life of 6 merks rent arising from Whitchurch Mill. He had the said rent by a grant of Fulk le Strange, and had enjoyed it for six years before the death of that Baron. The Jurors explained that both the Manor and Mill of Whitchurch were held, not of the King in capite, but under the Earl Warren, and by service of tak ing the Earl's venison, in all the Earl's English estates, and at the Earl's charges.2 Henceforward the history of Whitchurch was involved in the well-known history of the Barons Strange of Blackmere. The fol lowing Fines levied by John, son and heir of the above Fulk le Strange, relate exclusively to Whitchurch. By a Fine of April 24, 1334, John le Strange and his wife Ancarett (represented by her at torney, Griffin de Lee) concede the right of Bartholomew de Berde feld, Parson of Ightefeld, to the Manor and Advowson of White churche. The said Trustee settles the same on John and Ancarett, with entail upon the heirs of John. By another Fine of July 8, 1347, John le Strange of Whyte church and his wife Ancarett, have the Manor of Whitchurche set tled on themselves for their lives, with remainder to Fulk, son of John, and the heirs of Fulk by his wife Elizabeth; but in default of such heirs, to the right heirs of John. As to Undertenants in Whitchurch or its members, I have not a word more to say. The exclusive jurisdiction, maintained by its Lords, probably kept the internal affairs of the Manor thus secret. One or two Cadets of the Warrens of Whitchurch have been al ready mentioned, as for instance the Lords of Ightfield, and that Ralph de Albo Monasterio whose heir was Mesne-Lord of Waran shall in 1285.3 CHURCH OF ST.

He who listened to the Councils of Lanfranc, and founded, first the Priory of Lewes, and afterwards that of Castle Acre, must be judged by such a standard rather than by the ridiculous story in vented by the Monks of Ely against his memory.1 We have seen that, whenever founded, this Church was so nota ble as that it served to change the very name of one of the two largest Manors in Odenet Hundred.

Godeva held it (in Saxon times) ; but from Ceppecanole she used to pay 2s. to the Church of St. Chad.\"1 Godeva, Saxon Lady of Cheswardine, was of course the Countess Godiva, and the Church, which had a rent-charge on Chipnall, pro bably granted by herself, was Lichfield Cathedral. How this Manor was severed from the County and Barony of Stafford, we cannot tell. We shall see that Robert, third Baron Stafford, looked upon the change as a wrong to himself. Meanwhile we learn that Cheswardine was in the hands of Henry I., and came to the hands of Henry II. as a Royal Manor, whose value bore the proportion of \u00a34 to the total of \u00a3265. 15s., which constituted the reputed fiscal income of the Royal Demesnes of Shropshire. Before Michaelmas 1155, the King had granted Cheswardine to Hamo le Strange. The revenue thereof is assigned to him on the Pipe- Roll of 1156 in the usual form \u2014 Et in terris datis Hamoni Extraneo 4 lib. This continued till Michaelmas 1159. At Mich aelmas 1160 the correspondent entry is \u2014 Et Johanni Extraneo 4 lib. in Chesewurda. The fact is that Hamo le Strange had died without legitimate issue, and his elder brother John, already Tenant in-capite of Nesse, was heir of Cheswardine. Thus things stood when, in 1165, the return, known as the Liber Niger, was made. \u2014 The Schedule of Robert, Baron Stafford, includes Cheswardine, as a Knight's-fee, which John le Strange was withholding from him.2 1 Domesday, so. 248, b, 2. 5 Cheswarda ; \u2014 feodum unius mililis, I quod Johannes Le Estrange ei difsorciat {Liber Niger, I. 138)."], [467, "CHESWARDINE AND CHIPNALL. 29 Notwithstanding the remonstrance thus implied, Cheswardine con tinued to be held by the family of Le Strange for ages.

Still it may make some details, which belong exclusively to Cheswardine, more intelligible, if I premise that the tenure in capite of Le Strange of Ness and Cheswardine was by service of 1\\ knights' -fees, and that Cheswardine constituted the half-fee. The great event of John le Strange's connection with Cheswar dine was his grant of the Advowson thereof to Haughmond Abbey.

That it is an offering for the well-being of King Henry IL, and the soul's-health of King Henry I. ; \u2014 (3). That it cannot have passed earlier than 1170, when the second William fitz Alan was only 16 years of age. The difficulty is, that the Deed appears to be attested by John fitz Alan, known to have been unborn at the time (1170-8), and only a younger son of his father, as long as that father was living.

The Scutage-Rolls prove that Ness and Ches wardine were held by service of 1| knights'-fees. Again the re puted fiscal value of Ness was \u00a37. 10s. and of Cheswardine was \u00a34 ; but neither Manor had paid a farthing to the King's Exchequer for 50 years preceding the date of this Feodary. John le Strange (II.) was deceased in 1237-8. In 1197-8 he had acquired Knokyn Castle by arrangement with his Cousins, the heirs of Guy le Strange. This will explain, and serve to date, his second Charter to Haughmond Abbey. It passed between 1198 and 1210, probably about 1209.\u2014 As John Extraneus, he gives to the Abbey, a whole fourth part of the vill of Chesewordin, with the Advowson of the Church, and a right of common throughout his demesnes there ; also the whole land of Norslepe, with the Upper Vivary, near his Castle of Kno kin.

There are two Charters of John le Strange (III.) to Haugh mond Abbey, which relate to Cheswardine. In one, styling him self John, son of John le Strange, he recovers the land of Norslepe, by giving the Canons a virgate at Cheswordin in exchange, which virgate was held by Helias the Priest, Henry the Beadle, Richard de Golston, and Ernod fitz Reginald. This Deed was attested by Robert de Girros, and probably passed about 1240.1 Some Ancestor of John le Strange had, it seems, made a grant to Haughmond Abbey of land at Lytcham, in Norfolk. This too was recovered by \"John le Strange tercius,\" who gives to the Canons in lieu thereof a noke of land at Chesewordin, viz. that which Henry fitz Aldred held. This Deed, attested solely by Sir Fulk de Orreby, probably passed in 1260-1. It seems that Cheswardine was one of the estates which John le Strange (III.) settled in fee on his younger son, Roger. I think that it may have been in his Father's lifetime, and between the years 1260 and 1265, that \u2014 Roger le Strange, \"Lord of Cheswardine,\" confirms to Haugh mond Abbey its previous acquisitions in this Manor. The Deed was attested by Robert de Cheyne, Sir Odo de Hodnet, and Roger de Pinelesdon, Clerk. In October, 1280, an Extent was made of Cheswardine in com mon with Roger le Strange's other estates at Childs Ercall, Elles mere, and Hampton. The Lord of Cheswardine held 44 acres and two Mills in demesne. For the latter he paid a rent of 6s. 8d. to William de Chippeknolle,2 and 6c?. to the Lord of Tirley,3 and 6d. to the Lord of Golston.4 Among the Tenants of Cheswardine were Richard Forester (holding 1^ virgates, at a rent of 9s. 46?. and 4 hens), and William de Chippeknolle (holding 2\\ virgates). The whole income of the Manor was \u00a36. 14s. 8\\d.h The Tenure-Roll of 1285 says that \"Roger Extraneus holds Cheswardyne with its members, viz.

In Easter Term, 1293, John le Strange appeared coram Rege, and vouched the required warranty. He produced Henry II.'s Charter of Ches wardine, with its liberties, to Hamo le Strange, \" his antecessor, whose heir he was.\" \u2014 An abstract of this important Charter is preserved on the Plea- Roll, and not, that I know of, elsewhere.

On July 24, 1304, Roger le Strange obtained the King's Charter for holding a weekly Market at Cheswarthin, on Mondays, and also a yearly Fair of three days' duration, viz. the eve, the day, and the morrow, of the Translation of St. Swythin.3 The testing-clause of a Deed, already noticed,4 proves that about the year 1307 there was a \u2014 John le Strange of Cheswardine, distinct from John le Strange 1 Quo Waranto, p. 720.

Both of them must have been Feoffees of Roger le Strange, then living. The Inquest taken in 1311, on Roger le Strange's death, does not extend to his Shropshire estates, which were all probably settled. John le Strange is entered as Lord of Cheswardine in the Nomina Villarum of 1316. He was, as we have seen, illegitimate, but he had power to settle Cheswardine, subject to his own life, on Hamo, a younger son of Fulk le Strange of Blackmere, thereby disinheriting his own sister Lucia. \u2014 The Fine whereby this was effected was levied by Royal precept on Nov. 12, 1315. John Lestraunge of Cheseworthyn (Plaintiff) first allows a gift of the Manor to Fulk Lestraunge (Deforciant). Fulk then returns it to John, for his life, with remainder to Hamo, son of Fulk, and to the heirs ofthe said Hamo; \u2014 to hold ofthe King. Hence in the Inquest taken Oct. 22, 1330, on the death of John Lestrange of Cheswardine, it was found that he had died seized of nothing in demesne. The Manor of Cheswardine he had held in capite, for half a knight's-fee, under a grant thereof by Fulk le Strange, for his life. It now remained to Hamo, son of the said Fulk, and to the heirs of Hamo. We now hear for the first time of Cheswardine Castle. The Jurors reported it as a fortress of little strength (debile)} Hamo le Strange died without issue, so that his heir was his elder brother John le Strange of Blackmere. It must have been the latter Baron who, on January 30, 1333, obtained a Charter of Free- Warren for his demesnes at Cheswardine, Whitchurch, Corfham, Wrockwardine, Sutton, Betton, and Longnor.2 Afterwards Ches wardine descended to the Talbots, Earls of Shrewsbury, as Heirs general of Le Strange of Blackmere. Undertenants. The Sprenghoses were Le Strange's Tenants at Longnor. \u2014 A branch of the family seems also to have had some feoffment in Cheswardine. One Engelard Sprenghose gave land in Chesewurthyn to Lilleshall Abbey. A Rent-Roll of the 13th cen tury states the said land to be productive of 18fi?. per annum. The following Suit of mort d'ancestre was tried at the Assizes of 1272. Emma, wife of Richard de Acton, and Christiana, wife of Hugh le Joes, as daughters and heirs of Margery, late wife of Hugh Kewes chache, sued Richard de les Bigges and his wife, Emma, for a mes suage and half-bovate in Chesewardin.3 The result does not appear.

Louther had a brief of Quo Waranto against the Abbot of Hagh mon for one Mill and two virgates, and one bovate of land in Wrockwardine and Cheswardine, \u2014 all claimed by the Crown as the sometime seizin of King Henry II. The Mill (that of Allscott I presume) the Abbot proved to be his by grant of Henry II. As to the land (here put at J virgate and 1 bovate) , it was decided by Jury that the Abbot had the better right thereto.1 A similar claim by the Crown on the Advowson of Cheswardine, met with a like fate. The better right was found to be the Abbot's. Hugh de Louther affected that Henry III. had presented one John fitz Geoffrey to the Church.2 On March 26, 1324, the Abbot of Haughmond demises land in Cheswardine, and the reversion of land, held by Richard le Poynour, Vicar of Cheswardine, to William de Compton and John his son. The receipts of Haughmond Abbey from Cheswardine at a later period have been given under Naggington.3 Chipnall. One Thomas de Chipnoll occurs as Manucaptor for Johu le Strange in 1 250. In Michaelmas Term 1260, 18 Jurors of the Vicinage of Chip peknol reported to the Curia Regis that Thomas de Chippeknol and others, accused, by Juliana and Margery, widows of Robert de Alvideleg and William fitz Luke, of having murdered their said husbands, had indeed slain those two men; but that they were felons and fugitives, and had been slain, after raising the hue-and cry against them (as was the custom in the realm of England), and while they were resisting. The following suit of Easter Term 1271 relates to land in the Staffordshire Manor of Muckleston. \u2014 Alan de Campyun sued Thomas de Clipknol, and Alice his wife, and Roger Friday, and Matilda his wife, for a messuage and half-virgate in Mocliton. The Defendants said the Plaintiff had no ingress, save through Wilham Grulbe, who was only Lessee for a term (now expired), under Philip Campiun, the Plaintiff's Grandfather. The cause was adjourned, Roger Friday, as sole tenant, accepting the whole defence. 1 Quo Waranto, p. 683. The real question, sought to be raised by the Crown-Lawyer, was probably whether the Stranges had unlawfully alienated any part of a tenure in capite. The Abbot's appeal to a Jurata patri\u0153 was a dexterous avoidance of the question of law : for the issue of \" quis habeat majus jus \" was de- terminable by the Jury alone. 2 Quo Waranto, ibidem.

The Forest-Roll of 1180 shows that, previously to John le Strange's Fine with King John, all this district was reckoned to be within jurisdiction of the Shropshire Forests. For instance, the men of Sulleia were assessed 16s. for as many acres of wheat, the men of Goldestan 2s. for 2 acres of wheat, Alan of Goldestan Is. for 2 acres of oats, and the men of Cipenol Is. for the same. Under High Ercall we have had repeated hints that the Lords of that Manor held Sudeley, or part thereof, under the Lords of Ches wardine.1 In Sept. 1256 John fitz Aser and Margery his wife have a writ against John de Ercalew for disseizing them of a free tenement in Suthleg. CHURCH OF ST. SWITHIN AT CHESWARDINE. There is no symptom of a Church existing here at Domesday, and I should think that the district must have originally belonged to some great Staffordshire Parish. We have seen however that the Church both existed, and had been given to Haughmond Abbey, before the year 1170. The Taxation of 1291 shows how much more permanent than the secular boundaries of Counties were the original ecclesiastical divisions. Chesewurthyn was still reputed to be in the Arch deaconry of Stafford. The Church, as appropriated by Haughmond Abbey, was valued at \u00a36. 13s. 4c?.2 What Bishop had granted this appropriation I do not discover, but Bishop Langton, being at Pitchford on April 26, 1320, alludes to his Visitation of Haughmon in\"McccxLvm\" (read 1318 or perhaps 1315), at which he found the Church thus appropriated, and the Abbey sufficiently authorized in such appropriation by its Muniments. We know in fact that on July 2, 1315, the Bishop himself had allowed the Convent to apply the income from this Church to the clothing of the Brethren.3 The Ordination of the Vicarage was not settled in writing till Dec. 7, 1337.4 All the small tithes, except of the meadow of Robert Clerk of Chippenol, were to go to the Vicar. He was also to have the Manse and messuage wherein he now resided, and the land 1 Supra, Vol. IX. pp. 87, 89, 94. 2 Pope Nich.

The Vicar was to cause the Church to be served by a Chaplain, a Deacon, and other fit ministers, and was to provide the books, vestments, and utensils, appertaining to the Chancel. He was also to bear all Archidiaconal and ordinary charges. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth placed this Parish in the Shropshire Deanery of Newport. They rated it at \u00a35. 6s. 8c?., computing that \u00a31. 6s. Sd. of the Church Taxation represented income not now assessable, to say nothing of oblations, whieh were also irrelevant. *- The Valor of 1534-5 omits all notice of Cheswardine as a Parish Church; neither does the Abbot of Haughmond's return include any receipts from the Rectory. The following meagre list of Incumbents creates a suspicion that, under the infamous system of appropriations, the appointment of a Vicar was left very much to the option of the Canons of Haugh mond, and that the Vicarage was too poor to make the Bishops eager to exercise a right of lapse.

It may still be a question whether they ever belonged to Bascherch Hundred. On the other hand the strict letter of Domesday places two Manors (Eslepe and Sudtelch) in Culvestan Hundred. The first, being certainly Sleap Magna (near Loppington), I have scheduled in Bascherch Hundred. I have similarly transferred Sudtelch to the list of Bascherch Manors, not that I can identify it with any Manor so situated, but because it follows Eslepe in the Domesday Record, and naturally falls under the same marginal correction.1 I may now turn to give some account of the Hundred of Bas cherch, postea Pimhill ; \u2014 of its general jurisdiction, that is, irre spective of all questions of detail touching its changed area and limits. \u2014 In Edward the Confessor's time, the Hundred-Court was held at Baschurch. The revenues of the said Court were divided in the proportion of two to one, between the King and the Earl of Mercia. Earl Roger de Montgomery, being a Palatine Earl, had, in his day, the whole profits of the Hundred. At the forfeiture of Earl Robert, King Heury I. became Lord of the Hundred, but inasmuch as the Manor of Baschurch had previously passed to Shrewsbury Abbey, the Hundred-Court was henceforth held at Pimhill. The earliest Shropshire Assizes, of which there remains any detailed Record, were held in the Autumn of 1,203. The Hundred of Pemhull is entered as attending by its Jury and making the ordinary presentments. The same process is recorded on the Assize-Roll of 1221. The murder of Richard de Hadenhal, and the flight and outlawry of the supposed murderer, formed the only matter of presentment. At the Inquisitions of Hundreds in 1255 the twelve Jurors of Penbenhull chiefly confined their report to the tenure of the various Manors in their district, the withdrawal of Suits, from County and Hundred, by certain Manors, and the exactions of the King's Foresters. They further stated that the Sheriff realized a ferm of 100s. per annum from the Hundred of Penbenhull.3 At the Assizes of January 1256 the Hundred of Pemenhull at tended by its twelve Jurors, and Robert Slenge was its Chief-Bailiff. Among the Crown-Pleas was a challenge against Fulk fitz Warin, 1 Vide supra, Vol. V. page 1. 3 Rot. Hundred.

The Court could not enter on a matter which appeared to have taken place in Walcheria, and on the other side of Oswestry. At the Assizes of September 1272, Richard de Dudmaston, as Chief Bailiff, appeared with twelve Jurors, for the Hundred of Pemenhul. They stated their Hundred to be a Royal demesne, and valued it at 40s, per annum. At the Inquest of Hundreds, in November 1274, the Jurors of Pemenhul said that their Hundred was in the King's hand, that during the time of Sir John le Strange (i.e. during his Shrievalty) it used to be put out to farm at a rent of 40s., but that now the rent was 5 merks (\u00a33. 6s. 8d.), which was its true value. The Jurors complained that, ever since the Battle of Evesham (1265), the Bailiffs of this Hundred had levied from 6d. to Is. on every vill in their jurisdiction, whenever they received any royal mandate which necessitated summons of the freeholders for gaol delivery or other purposes. The successive Bailiffs, thus charged, were Thomas Dod, Hugh de Byritone, Adam Co * * *, John de Dudlebury, and Richard de Dodemunstone. In other parts of their report, the Jurors named John de la Hulle, Hugh Galle, William fitz Richard of Astley, Richard de Franketone, William Bryd, and Reyner Twychemare as extortionate Bailiffs, guilty of diverse acts of op pression.1 Probably most of these persons were Under -Bailiffs. Some further facts, elicited by this Inquest, shall be given in con nection with the persons or localities to whom, or to which, they refer. At the Assizes of 1292, Hugh de Rossall appeared with twelve Jurors to answer for the Pleas of the Crown and other matters con nected with Pymhull Hundred. The Jurors now valued the Hundred, or Bailiwick, at 8 merks per annum ,- and said it was the King's. Their further presentments related to Desalts of attendance, claims of Free- Warren, withdrawal of suits, alienations of lands which were held in capite, the state of Serjeantries, the condition of Montford Bridge, and the criminal business usual to such occa sions.3 1 Hot.

(1154). Hadnall consisted of five vills, viz. Hadnall, Hardwick, Shotton, Haston, and Smethcott. The aforesaid Gilbert, wishing to benefit Haughmond Abbey, gave thereto the whole of Hardwick, and a moiety of Hadnall. The Grant was fortified by confirmations of the Seigneural Lord (then William fitz Alan I.) and of King Henry II. The series of Charters which illustrate this gift may be taken to have passed be tween 1155 and 1158, and are not less remarkable for their form and language than for their antiquity.

In 1172 we have Pope Alexander's Bull, confirming to the Abbey \" Heordewice as the gift of Gilbert de Hedereshale, by consent of William fitz Alan, his Lord.\" It is uncertain whether Gilbert Anglicus, who in 1165 was hold ing a Mutator's fee in fitz Alan's Barony, was identical with Gilbert de Hadnall or not. In 1167 the Vill of Hedenhola was amerced half a merk by the Justice of the Forest. Gilbert de Hadnall left an only daughter and heir, Leticia, who became the wife first of Nigel Banastre, and afterwards of William Hose, or Hussey. By Nigel Banastre she had two children, William and Alice. Soon after the death of Nigel Banastre, and while yet a Widow, \" Leticia, 1 All Charters, quoted under Hadnall, I without specific references, are from the I Haughmond Chartulary (Titles, Haden hale; Hauston; Herdeuyike; Smethecote)."], [488, "46 HADNALL. daughter of Gilbert de Hadenhale, gives to her daughter Alice, to wards her marriage, one virgate in Hauston, viz. that which the Grantress held in her hand, when Nigel Banastre, her husband, died \u25a0 and which, when dying, he had requested her to concede to Alice.\" A rent of Id., to the Grantress and her heirs, is reserved. This Deed, which passed between 1182 and 1201, is attested by Robert le Poer, Henry his son, Wido de Shaubury, Helias de Gulidon, and Gilbert de Leton. Soon after this, aud on the actual marriage of Alice Banastre with Roger fitz Peter, her mother, stepfather, and brother, concurred in doubling her marriage portion. \u2014 By one Deed \" William Hose and Leticia his wife, at the request of William Banastre, son and heir of the said Leticia, give to Roger fitz Peter, in frank -marriage with Alice, Leticia's daughter, two virgates in Hauston, viz. one which Dame Avelina held, and one which Richard fitz Oliver held, saving iu all things the tenant-right of the said Avelina and her heirs.\" A rent of 4d. is reserved on this grant, and it is attested by Wido the Chaplain, Reiner de la Lee, and Stephen de Pym beley. Between the years 1203 and 1206 \" William, son of Nigel Banastre, confirmed the said two virgates, given in marriage of his Sister ; Witnesses, \u2014 William Hose, Reginald de Tyrne, and Richer de Shawbury.\" William Banastre (I.), some time between the years 1204 and 1220, and while his Mother Leticia was yet alive, married Emma, widow of Simon, aud mother of Roger de Jagdon. At the Assizes of 1221 William Banastre was found to have disseized Hugh de Rushal, and Hawise his wife, of a tenement in Adenhal. In another case he acknowledged himself to have disseized Thomas de Le of a tenement in Hadenhal. In October 1232 he was deceased, leaving a son and heir, William, and his wife Emma, still surviving. The Charters of William Banastre (I.) are as follows. \u2014 About 1216-1220 he gave to Haughmond Abbey all the land of Caldenhall, as bounded by the road between Herdewike and Smethcote. Wit nesses, \u2014 Sir Reiner, Bishop of St. Asaph; William Hose; Reiner de Acton; Wido de Hadenhale; Roger de Jagedun ; and John, son of Thomas le Strange. About the same time \" William Banastre conceded and confirmed to the same Abbey, for the souls' health of himself and his ances tors, all the land of Herdewyk, with all liberties and common rights in his wood, and other advantages.

Witnesses, \u2014 Sir John fitz Alan, Vivian de Rosshall, William de Ercalewe.\" About 1220-1224, \"William Banastre gave, to the support of the poor at the Gate of Haghmon Abbey, a rent of 12c?., arising from land at Hauston, formerly held by Walter Citharist, and now held by Geoffrey de Egebaldeham, who consented to the proposed transfer of his rent. Witnesses, \u2014 Vivian de Rosshale, Thomas his son, Baldwin de Hodnet, Robert de Acton, Alan de Burcton, Thomas de Lee, William de Balderton.\" Within the same interval \" William Banastre gave to the same purpose, for the souls' health of himself, his son Laurence, and all his friends (parentum) the whole service of Wrido de Hadenhale, viz. 2s. annual rent, receivable from a virgate in Hadenhale, held by the said Wido, which rent was now thus transferred with Wido's goodwill and assent. Witnesses, \u2014 Vivian de Rossale, Thomas his son, Baldwin de Hodenet, Odo his son.\" Again, \"William Banastre gave to the same purpose, for the souls' health of himself, his wife Emma, and his son Laurence, half a virgate in Hadenhale, held by Robert Swist, and half the assart land of the said Robert.

For this the Canons paid one merk. Witnesses, \u2014 William de Ercalwe, William de Stanton, Philip de Peninton, Alan de Burton.\" Afterwards, as it seems to me, \" William Banastre gave to the Abbey the half-virgate itself which Alan held in Smethcote.

Witnesses, \u2014 William de Ercalowe, William de Stanton, Alan de Bructon, Philip de Peninton.\" Again, \" William Banastre gave and conceded, to the same Abbey, 16 acres near the culture of Scotwelle, and all the land which lay between the fields of Herdewyk and the Vivary.

Witnesses, \u2014 Richard de Hadleg, Walter Hoscotus (read Hosatus), Richard Corbet, Wido de Hadnall, William my son.\" Lastly, \"William Banastre gives to the Abbey, together with his body, all his share of the bosc of Hedenhale. Witnesses, \u2014 Wydo de Hedenhale, Roger Cook, Richard Baker, Richard le Hare, Adam the Hospicer, and William the Porter.\"1 Emma, widow of William Banastre (I.), had some difficulty in obtaining her dower. We have heard of William de Drayton, a Prebendary of Wroxeter, and his son Alan.3 This William having obtained feoffmeut of two virgates in Shotton, transferred them to the said Alan : but in Michaelmas Term 1232 Emma, widow of William Banastre, had impleaded Alan fitz William for the same as her dower, and Alan had called his father, William de Wrocestre, to warranty. The latter argued that Emma had no right to dower in the premises, for that Leticia, her husband's mother, was seized thereof at the time of Emma's marriage, so that her husband, not being seized, could not have granted such dower. Emma replied, allowing the above fact, but adding that her husband gave the said dower with consent of his mother, Leticia. The Court left an issue for a provincial Jury, viz. \" Whether William Banastre on the day of his espousals did so grant dower with his Mother Leticia's con sent.\" The result of this suit I cannot discover. Richard fitz Wil liam, another Feoffee in Shotton or Hadnall, seems to have been Defendant in a parallel suit (loqueld conrelatd) . William Banastre (II.) was probably quite young at his father's death. It is he however, who is entered on the Feodaries of 1240 as, together with his Partners, holding half a knight's-fee in Haden hale, Hauston, Swetton (Shotton), and Smethecot, of the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 In the Hundred- Roll of 1255 Hadenhale maintains its 1 These witnesses, being chiefly domes tic servants of the Abbey, imply that the Grantor was dying at the time, and within the precincts of the Abbey. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 316. 3 Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 47, 49."], [491, "49 HADNALL. Domesday measurement of four hides. William Banastre held the same of the fee of John fitz Alan, doing the service of one Knight at Oswestry in war-time. The Manor did suit to County and Hun dred, and paid 8c?. per hide for stretward and motfee ,*\u25a0\u2014 the usual assessment for Manors in Pimhill Hundred. At the Assizes of 1256 William Banastre is named as seventh Juror for Pimhill Huudred. The waste condition of William Banastre's wood, as reported at the Forest Assize of 1262, shows Hadnall to have been within regard of the Wrekin Forest. A debt of 12c?. pro plevind is recorded on the same Roll against William Banastre de Acton ; but I do not know why William Ba nastre of Hadnall should be thus described. In December of the same year William Banastre was Foreman of a Leaton Jury. In March 1272 the services due from William Banastre in respect of half a knight's-fee in the Barony of Fitz Alan were assigned to the King as Guardian of young Richard fitz Alan. At the Assizes of 1272 William Banastre was amerced for some failure in punctual appearance ; but it is doubtless he who, as Wil liam Balastre, and with Thomas Dod, was Elizor for Pimhill Hun dred at the same Assizes. Of the Charters of William Banastre (II.) , the most important is his confirmation of all his father's and ancestors' gifts, sales, and concessions to Haughmond Abbey. He here styles himself \" Wil liam Banastre, son of William Banastre,\" and enumerates the fol lowing grants, viz. Herdewyce; Caldenhalle; 16 acres near Schotte well; the land between Hardewyk-fields and the Vivary ; a moiety of Hadenhall wood ; the half-virgate and assart once held by Robert Swist; the service of Wydo de Hadenhale on one virgate; a mes suage, croft, and 6 acres which Heming once held in Hadenhale ;3 common-pasture in Smethcote, Hauston, Hadenhale, and Shotton; and 12c?. rent from Walter Citharist's land in Hauston. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Robert de Gyrrois, Hugh fits Robert, William de Hedleg, Roger de Pivelesdon, then Sheriff, Thomas Huse, Master Richard de Kagworth, and Wrydo de Hadenhale. Other Charters of William Banastre (II.) will be quoted hereafter, as mere confirmations of the acts of his Tenants. In May 1274 a William Banastre sat as seventh Juror on a Mulford Inquest; and in the Hundred-Roll of November 1274 William Banastre is named sixth of the Pimhill Jurors. This 1 Rot. Hundred.

A Tenure- Roll of Pimhill Hundred, drawn up about 1279, says that \" William Banaster holds Hadnall oi John fitz Alan1 by service of half a knight's-fee in war time.\"3 William Banastre (III.) must be he who occurs as tenth Juror on a Shrewsbury Inquest in 1277, and as eighth Juror on a Chet wynd Inquest in April 1281. About the same time, styling himself \" William, son of William Banastre of Smethcote,\" he gives the Canons of Haghmon leave to take heath and gorse from his land for their Grange at Grinsill. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Thomas Botterell, John de Lee, Reiner de Acton, knights; Roger de Preston, Martin de Burhton, Philip de Pe ninton, Reiner de Lee, Thomas de Muridon. This Deed further defines the boundaries of the Canons' field at Hardwick, called Hothfeld. William and Richard Banastre occur as first and fifth Jurors on a Bicton Inquest in January 1291, and as first aud eleventh Jurors on a Besford Inquest in December 1291. 3 Richard Banastre I con ceive to have been afterwards of Smethcote, and a younger brother of William. William, son of William de Hadenhale, was reported by the Pimhill Jurors as not punctual in attendance at the Assizes of 1292. Possibly William Banastre (III.) was the person alluded to. At these Assizes the Abbot recovered 16 acres in Hadnall Wood against William Banastre. On July 20, 1293, the Abbot and William Banastre came to an agreement about Hadnall Wood. \u2014 \" William quitclaimed the Abbot's moiety, and the Abbot quitclaimed Wil liam's moiety, saving the 15 acres which he had already recovered therein.

John le Childe, Richard Horde, John Husee, Thomas de Withinton, Robert de Preston, William de Oteley, and Robert de Burcton, attested the agreement. 1 The Roll contains several repetitions of this anachronism, but corrects itself, more than once speaking of the Seigneury of Isabel de Mortimer (John fitz Alan's widow) and once of Richard fitz Alan (his infant heir). 2 Roll, in possession of the Author. 3 Inquis. 19, 20 Edw.

On October 1, 1318, certain disputes, about a fourth part of Hadnall Wood, were settled by John, sou of Reiner de la Lee, of the one part, and the Abbot of Haghmon and William Banastre, of the other part. The latter concede 40 acres to John de Lee, who quitclaims the remainder. Witnesses, \u2014 John de Warren, John Husee, and John de la Lee of Roden. I will not attempt to give any later and connected account of the Banastres of Hadnall. In the fourteenth century there were three families of Banastres, styled respectively of Hadnall, of Smethcote, and of Yarton. I cannot say how they were related, nor indeed which was the elder line. Their importance at Hadnall gave way to that of the Lees. Nevertheless they continued to have negotia tions with Haughmond Abbey concerning lands in Hadnall ; the substance of which negotiations will be given at the end of this Chapter. I would here point out that in 1353, the actual possession of the Manor of Hadnall was in John Corbet and his wife Matilda, and three others, but that such possession was terminable with the life of the said Matilda. The reversion was in Agnes, wife of Thomas, son of Thomas de Lee of Stanton ; but the said Agnes and her hus band concurred in settling it on the Banastres of Yarton in a mode already pointed out.1 I would further remark that a Feodary of 1397-8 names John Lee as Tenant of half a knight's-fee in Hadenhale in the Barony of the late attainted Earl of Arundel.3 My Pedigree of the Lees will not account for any John Lee at this period,3 and I suspect that, as regards some of the Tenants' names, the Feodary in question was copied from some much older document. The Feoffments and Subtenures which existed in Hadnall and and its members were numerous, and introduced several families of importance into the Manor. Tenement of Roger fitz Peter. \u2014 Roger fitz Peter, afterwards called Roger de Hauston, married Alice Banastre, as we have seen, about 1203-6, and obtained with her two virgates in Haston, one held by Dame Avelina, the other by Richard fitz Oliver.* A rent of 4c?. was reserved to the Banastres on this grant, and a further rent of 8d. was reserved on 22 acres in Aldeleg, which William * Supra, Vol. IX. p. 295. I 4 Supra, page 46. 1 Supra, Vol. IX. p. 302. 2 Calend. Inquis., Vol. III. p. 223."], [494, "52 HADNALL. Banastre (I.) subsequently granted to Roger de Hauston. Dame Avelina's life-interest had been specially reserved in one of the above virgates. She proves to have been Roger de Hauston's grandmother. After her death and about the year 1230 \u2014 \" Roger de Hauston, with the consent of William Banastre his lord, and of Richard (de Hauston) his own son and heir, enfeoffed one Wido de Westbury, in the virgate, late his Grandmother Avelina's, and also in a messuage and 22 acres, which William Banastre had given to the said Roger. A rent of 14c?., and a payment of 14 merks down, procured this feoffment, which was attested by Sir Thomas Corbet, Sir William Pantulf, Robert de Girros, and Vivian de Rossall.\" \" William Banastre \" (I.) \" confirmed this purchase of Wido de Westbury's and quitclaimed all his right therein. Witnesses Sir Thomas Corbet, Richard Corbet, Roger de Eston, and Alan de Bur ton.\" It must not be assumed that the 8c?. rent, which William Banastre had originally reserved on this tenement, was annihilated by this quitclaim. He had himself given it to William de Wroxeter, or to Alan his son. About the year 1236 Wido, here called son of Herbert, Chaplain of Westbury, gave to Haghmon Abbey the virgate and twenty acres, which he had purchased from Roger de Hauston, reserving all capi tal services (that is, the Abbey was to pay 14c?. rent to Roger de Hauston). Witnesses, \u2014 Thomas de Rossall, Thomas de Lee, Wido de Hadenhale, Walter Huse, Alan de Burcton, Alan le Poer. Next to this, we have a Deed, showing Roger de Hausion resign ing all his mesne right in Hauston to the Abbey ; that is, not only the 14ft?. rent due on Wydo de Westbury's tenement, but the rent, whnt ever it was, which was due to him on Richard fitz Oliver's virgate. In other words \u2014 \" Roger de Hauston, with consent of Richard his son and heir, gives and confirms to the Abbey all the land which he had in Hauston in marriage with Alice his wife, viz. 2 virgates, formerly held by Wydo de Westbury and Richard fitz Oliver ; also he gives those 22 (sic) acres in Hauston, all which premises were contained in the Charters of Leticia, formerly Lady of Smethcote, and of William Banastre, her son and heir. The Abbey is however to pay 4c?. rent on the two virgates to the heirs of William Banastre, and 8c?. rent on the 22 acres to Alan, son of William de Drayton. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Thomas de Roshale, Walter Huse, Thomas de Lee, Alan de Burcton, Reiner (sic) de Hadenhale, and Thomas Cresset.\" Contemporary with this Deed is the Confirmation thereof, by Richard, son of Roger de Hauston, who calls the above William"], [495, "53 HADNALL. Banastre (I.) his Uncle (avunculum), and speaks of the marriage of his father, Roger, and his mother Alice. This Deed also reserves the same rents as the last, except that the persons entitled to such rents are described as \" the heirs of William Banastre of Smethcott,\" and as \" Alan de Drayton son of William the Chaplain.\" The Deed is attested as the last, except that Wido de Hadenhale is 'substituted, and no doubt correctly, for Reiner de Hadenhale. Again, we have the almost contemporary Confirmation of William Banastre (II.) . As \" William, son of William Banastre, he con firmed to the gate-alms of the Abbey, two virgates already given by Roger de Hauston and Richard his son, and once held by Wydo de Westbury and Richard fitz Oliver, together with 22 acres, in Haus ton. This Deed retains rents of 4c?. to the Grantor, and of 8d. to Alan, son of William de Drayton. Witnesses,\u2014 Sir Robert de Gyros, William de Hedleg, Reiner de Acton, and Wido de Hadenhale.\" There are two later Confirmations by William Banastre (IL), in one of which, calling himself \" William Banastre, son of William Banastre of Smethcote,\" he quitclaims the 4c?. rent heretofore re served to himself on two virgates. By the others, as William Banastre he makes the tantamount concession of 2 virgates, &c, to hold to the Abbey, \" freely, quietly, and without any reclaim of his.\" This Deed must have passed about 1252-3, being attested by Sir Thomas de Rossall, Sir Vivian his son, Sir Thomas de la Lee, Thomas Botterell, John de Moreton, Martin de Burcton, Ri chard de Petton, and Roger de Leton. We have now traced to Haughmond Abbey the Fee-simple and mediate rights to all the estate once held by Roger de Hauston and Alice Banastre, except that I cannot find Alan de Drayton's rent of 8c?. thus brought up. It probably descended to the Lees, one of whom married Alan's daughter, Petronilla, and who already had an estate in Hadnall ; \u2014 of which I propose next to speak. \u2014 Tenement of Lee, Bottrell, and Cheyney. Reyner de Lee, Thomas de Lee, and John de Lee, already alluded to under Aldon, Chatwall, Berrington, Hunkington, and other places, have each in turn been seen attesting the Hadnall Deeds of the 13th century. How they first became enfeoffed here, I cannot say. About 1235-40, \" Thomas de Le gave pasturage in all his fee of Hadenhall to the Canons of Haghmon, for their working cattle at Grinsill. Wit nesses, \u2014 John fitz Alan, Thomas de Rossall, Hugh de Rossall, Alan de Burcton, Wido de Hadenhale.\" We have seen that Thomas de Lee was alleged to have entailed"], [496, "54 HADNALL. on his younger son, Reyner, 6 messuages, one carucate, and 3 vir gates in Hadnall, but that the grant was not an entail on Reyner and the heirs of his body, and did not preclude alienation.1 In November, 1249, Wido de Hadnall, of whose name we have had such frequent repetition, was deceased without issue. His widow, Petronilla, who was perhaps a Lee, is said, on good autho rity, to have married Thomas Botterell. If so, it must have been between the years 1249 and 1253 that Thomas de la Lee granted lands in Hadnall to Thomas Botterell and Petronilla his wife, About the year 1280 the son and heir of Thomas de la Lee, call ing himself \" John, Lord of La Lee,\" gave to Sir Thomas Botterell, knight, and to Petronilla, his wife, and their heirs, a certain assart near Hadnall Wood, which Robert de Hauston held, which lay near Richard le Woodward's assart, and contained 60 acres. For this the Grantees were to pay a peppercorn rent, if the Grantor came to require it, at their house of Hadenhale. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Robert Corbet, Sir Reyner de Acton, William Banastre, Roger de Preston. There are many indications of Sir Thomas Botterell having been resident at Hadnall. It was there probably that his son John died in 1281, as elsewhere alluded to.3 If Thomas Botterell's wife, Pe tronilla, was a Lee, it is probable that she was Sifter of Sir John de Lee, whose second wife, Alice Bottrell, was, I also think, a sister of Thomas Bottrell. It is extraordinary however that Petronilla, after being the childless wife of Wido de Hadnall for 20 years, should appear as the Mother of Thomas Bottrell's son. Such was however the case. On May 1, 1297, \" John, son and heir of Sir Thomas de la Lee, confirmed to Richard Botterell, his (John's) father's donation to Thomas Botterell and' Petronilla his wife, of lands which they held in Hadnall; together with a parcel of land, called La Lye, which Richard's mother, Petronilla, had previously held under the Gran tor; \u2014 to hold to Richard and his heirs, as Petronilla held it, viz. by a rose rent. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Richard de Harley, Ralph de Arraz, knights, John de Upton. Dated at Aston Boterei.\" On May 20, 1318, \" Richard Botterel sold to Hugh, son of Roger de Cheyney, all his lands and tenements in Hadnall-juxta-Asteley ; \u2014 to hold under the superior Lords thereof. Witnesses, \u2014 Richard le Childe of Diddlebury, &c.\" On November 3, 1320, Robert de Rodene, of Hadnall, and his wife Isabel, daughter of Roger Holiday, gave a seylion in Hadnall 1 Supra, Vol. IX. p. 300. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 395."], [497, "55 HADNALL. to Hugh de Cheyne. Witnesses, \u2014 William Banastre, Roger de Leton, Roger de Wollascote, John de Smethcote, Roger Banastre. On a previous page will be found the provision made by Nicholas Abbot of Haughmond, on April 5, 1336, to found a Chantry for Hugh, son of Sir Roger de Cheyne.1 On April 8, 1336, Hugh de Cheyne gives to the said Abbot a messuage in Hadnall, and an assart called Botterels-bruche ; \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir William de Ercalwe, Robert Corbet of Morton, knights; and Richard Huse. A duplicate Deed conveys all the Grantor's land in Hadnall to the Abbot, and is additionally tested by Roger Tromwyn, Richard Horde of Walford, Philip de Peniuton, and Stephen de Rossall. There is also a Release from Hugh de Cheyne to the Abbot, dated June 17, 1336, and attested by William de Ercalwe, Robert Corbet of Morton, and Walter de Hopton, knights. Then there is the same Hugh's appointment of William de Smethcote as his At torney to give the Abbot seizin. On April 10, 1336, an Inquest ad quod damnum was held as to Hugh de Cheyne's more specific proposal of giving a messuage, a virgate, and 21 acres, in Hadenhale, to the Abbey. It seems that the mediate interest of the Lees had vanished from this tenement, which was found to be held sine medio, under Richard, Earl of Arundel, at a rent of 5s. Thirty Librates of land and rent at Auroston, Herefordshire, also held under the said Earl, would still remain with Hugh de Cheyne. The King's license, allowing the proposed grant to Haughmond, bears date August 6, 1336. There seems to have been some doubt as to the disposition of Hugh de Cheyney's wife-and heirs in this matter. On August 16, 1336, he binds himself in a penal bond of \u00a340, payable on Oct. 6 following, and void, only in case of the Abbot's having peaceable possession of the premises on Hugh's death, and of Hugh's widow, Agnes, seeking no dower therein. However, on May 5, 1337, the Abbot demises to Robert de Alverton for life, a messuage, &c., in Hadnal, late Hugh Cheyne's. We have now traced an estate in Hadnal as passing from Lee, through Bottrell and Cheyney to Haughmond Abbey. But this was only a portion of Lee's asserted holding. For instance, an Assize- Roll of June 1307 shows John, son of Reyner de Lee, backed by (his Uncle) Sir John de Lee, as Surety, and suing the Abbot of Haghmon and William Banastre for disseizin in Hadnall. This 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 302."], [498, "56 HADNALL. suit failed ; and we have a subsequent but undated Quitclaim, where in John, son of Reiner de Lee, gave to the Abbey all his right to that assart in Hadnall Wrood near Smethcote, which the Abbey had recovered by process of novel disseizin against William Banastre (i. e. in 1292). This Quitclaim was attested by Roger de Haghmon, John Husee of Albrighton, Master Robert de Preston, John le Botiler, and Richard Gery of Acton. I presume it to have been part of the transaction already alluded to as belonging to the year 1318. l Again in 1317, as we have already seen,2 Sir John de Lee (the uncle of John fitz Reyner) quitclaimed a parcel of land in Hadnall to Haughmond Abbey. The said parcel is defined on one side by Richard Botterell's assart. Again, it was the Great-Grandson of John fitz Reyner who on March 11, 1370, and as \"Roger, son and heir of John de la Lee,\" released to the same Abbey all his right to the laud formerly held by Hugh de Cheyne. Witnesses, \u2014 Robert Corbet of Morton, John de Ludelowe, Peter de Caverswelle, knights ; Richard Husee, William Banastre of Yorton, and Edmund de Burghton. Last in the series of quotations comes the abortive effort of 1408, already set forth,3 where Petronilla, daughter and heir of the above Roger and wife of Robert Lee of Roden, tried to oust the Abbot of Haughmond from Hadnall on the alleged ground that the Lee estates there, had been entailed on the bodily heirs of Reyner, Pe tronilla's Great, great, great, Grandfather. Wido de Hadnall's Tenement. We have seen Wido de Had nall attesting Manorial Deeds from 1220 to 1245 or thereabouts. About 1230-1, as \"Wido de Hadenhale, son of William, he gave and confirmed to Haghmon Abbey, for the health of himself and Petronilla his wife, and with their bodies, to be buried in the Abbey, a messuage, croft, and 6 acres, in the field of Hadenhale, which Heming held. The Canons are to pay a rent of 12o?. during the Grantor's life, but not afterwards. Witnesses, \u2014 William Ba nastre, William de Balderton, Alan de Burcton, Thomas de Lee.\" William Banastre confirmed this grant in a Deed already noticed as having passed about 1230-2.4 About 1249-50 \" Petronilla, widow of Wido de Hadnall, released all right iu the premises granted by her late husband.

Richard de Hadenhale, alias Richard fitz Wil liam (who has already occurred in 1232), and Ralph de Hadenhale, alias Ralph fitz Richard, now claimed to be nephews and coheirs of Wido de Hadnall, and sued Thomas and Agnes Dod for a third of 60 acres (except 7 acres), in Hadnall, as their purparty ofthe estate of Wydo their late Uncle (avunculi) . The Plaintiffs tried to prove some default on the part of the Defendants, rather than their own title, and they failing in this, the cause was dismissed sine die. The Pipe-Roll of 1250 gives Ralph fitz Richard de Hadenhale, and Rich ard fitz William de Hadenhale, as amerced half a merk each pro salso clamore. Thomas Dod of Hadnall was on a Leaton Jury in 1\u00a362 and an Elizor for Pimhill Hundred at the Assizes of 1272. Within the seven preceding years he had served the office of Bailiff of the same Hundred. He seems to have been living after the year 1276. I have no present proof that his descendants retained any estate in Hadnall. H aston. By a Fine of Nov. 18, 1240, Roger fitz William (Plain tiff) allows the right of Aldith, wife of Simon de Haueston (Tenants) to a virgate in Haueston, and receives a messuage and 6 acres in return, to hold at a rent of 2s. Hauested Meadow, Longesmalelond, and Pidlewellefurlund, are localities alluded to in the Fine ; but I am not by any means sure that it relates to this Haston. At the Assizes of 1256, Thomas Dod, Roger Swyst, Robert de Haukeston, his two brothers Roger and Thomas, Roger de Smede cote, and John de Haukeston, were Co-Defendants in an action about a fence, unjustly made in Clive. They showed themselves to be only instruments ofthe Abbot of Haughmon in the matter. At the Forest Assizes of 1262 Roger fitz Christian was the Essoignor of Thomas de Haueston, deceased. Robert de Haueston occurs on a Leaton Inquest in 1262, and was one of the Pimhill Jurors at the Assizes of 1272, and at the Inquest of 1274. At this Inquest oppressions or exactions of local Officers were complained of by John, Thomas, and Roger de Haustone. In the same year Robert de Hauston and his brother John are found on an Elles- H x."], [500, "58 HADNALL. mere Inquest. At the Assizes of 1292 William, son of John de Haueston, was one of the Defaulters in Pimhill Hundred. On May 3, 1301, Gilbert, Abbot of Haughmond, demises to Richard le Woodwarde, Cecily his wife, and Richard their son, a messuage and 6 acres in Hauston for their lives. In October 1311 John de Hauston occurs on a Peplow Jury. On January 20, 1330, \" John, son of Roger de Hauston, gives to Master Robert de Preston, Clerk, a messuage and two parts of half a virgate in Hauston, and accustomed estovers in Hadnall Wood, and all the land he had in Hauston, viz. a messuage, &c, which he had of the inheritance of Matilda, his mother; \u2014 to hold to the Grantee under the Chief Lords. For this the Grantee paid 12 merks and one robe.

Hardwtck. \u2014 Of this member of Hadnall, I can say no more than that in the \" fourth year of King Edward \" (probably 1276) John de la Lee quitclaimed to Haughmond Abbey his right of common in all the Canons' appruaments and clearings in the waste of Herdwik. Smethcott. We have seen that before the year 1230 William Banastre (I.) sold to Haghmon Abbey, first the rent, and after wards the land, of one Alan, in Smethcott. Coincidently the Tenant, as \" Alan fitz Herebert,\" quitclaims to the Abbey for 2 merks all his right in the same half-virgate. Witnesses, \u2014 William Banastre, Alan de Burchton. At the Assizes of 1256 Robert le Poer, as son and heir of another"], [501, "HAUGHMOND ABBEY FEE. 59 Robert le Poer, claimed 2 acres in Smedecote. The Abbot of Lilleshull now held the premises under a 36 years' demise of John de Tonge, and he under a demise of William Banastre. The latter appeared as Defendant and Warrantor, and was dismissed sine die. At the Forest-Iter of 1267 \"William Banastre of Smethcott\" was amerced 10s. pro veteri vasto. I have before intimated that the elder line of Banastres was at this time styled \"of Smethcott,\" though afterwards the distinction was applied to a younger branch. William fitz Margery of Smethcott, who occurs on a Jury List of 1274, was one ofthe Defaulters in Pimhill Hundred at the Assizes of 1292. John de Smethcott occurs as a Witness in 1320. Haughmonu Abbey Fee in Hadnall, &c. Some further par ticulars as to the accumulations which we \u25a0 have seen the Canons of Haughmond making to their original estate at Hardwick are worth noting. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Abbot a Carucate at Herdewike, worth 10s. per annum; and 4s. 2c?. assized rents in Hadenhale : also 5s. assized rents in Balkerton (read Balderton) and in Welleston (read Webbescowe, now WTebscott).1 Early in the year 1300, as it seems, a Writ of Roger fitz John (of Bolas), Custos ofthe Forests of Salop, enjoins the Abbot to find six Sureties who should answer for the recent waste made in Hadnall Bosc, and then allows the Abbot to have reseizin of the same. Among the Abbot's Sureties were John Hauston, Ralph de Drayton, John de Hadenhale, and John de Nagynton. The Chartulary triumphantly appends to this procedure an extract from the nearly contemporary Perambulation, viz. the passage which relates to the disforesting of Hadnall.3 In the year 1316, the Abbot of Haghmon demises land in Had nall to Roger Banastre, Agnes his wife, and William his son, for their lives, at 2s. rent. In 1322-3 the Abbot makes a further demise to the same persons, for a like term, at 10s. rent. In 1323-4 the Abbot demises to Thomas, son of Robert Attew ode and Sibil his wife, two parcels of land in Hadenall, for their lives, at 12s. rent. About this time an Agreement between the Abbot and William, son of Richard Banastre of Smethcott, as to Hadnall Wood, is attested by Sir Richard de Leghton, Sir William de Ercalawe knights; Richard Hore, William Hore, John Husee, John de la Lee, and Richard Gery of Acton. 1 Pope Nich. axation, p. 260. ** Supra, Vol. IX. p. 149."], [502, "60 HADNALL. In October 1342 Abbot Nicholas exchanges land in Hadnall with William le Stoupere. In the year 1352 the Abbot demises land to William Banastre of Hadnall, Johanna his wife, and John their eldest son, for their lives. On January 13, 1359 (if the date be correctly given in the Chartulary),1 Abbot Richard of Haghmon releases to William Banastre, son of Roger Banastre of Hadnal, all right to a parcel of land held by the said William under a demise from William, son of Richard Banastre of Smethcote. On Oct. 6, 1381, Abbot Nicholas demises a messuage and virgate in Hadnall to John Hulle, Rector of Middle, for 90 years ; \u2014 a rent of 12s. and suit of the Abbot's Court at Herdewike being reserved. On June 15, 1402, John Hulle, late Rector of Middle, releases the above demise as one for 99 years. On Oct. 10, 1471, William, son and heir of Thomas Banastre of Hadnall, releases to the Abbey all right of common in Hadnall ; and, \" his seal being almost unknown, uses the seal of the Master and Brethren of Battelfeld College.\" Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Roger Ky naston, knight, Philip his brother, Richard Husey, Robert Chorl ton, and Thomas his brother. In 1535-6 the Abbot of Haughmond's estate at Herdwyke was returned as producing \u00a320. 14s. ll^c?. per annum; but this must have included rents froni other places than Hadnall. His receipts from Smethcote and Acton Reynald are anomalously combined with those from Wylcote (near Ness), the whole being \u00a33. 5s. The Salary of Richard Tyler, the Abbot's Bailiff at Herdwyke, was \u00a31 per annum.2 In the Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 the Assets of the late Abbey are grouped in a very different way. \u2014 The -following items probably include, or bear reference to, es tates in or near Hadnall.

It may be added that the Stantons, the presumed descendants of Ricardus, continued to be Seigneural Lords of both Manors till the extinction of their male line in the reign of Edward I. The family which held Acton under De Stanton took its name from the place. The first of whom I find any mention is \u2014 Richard de Acton, already seen to have attested a Deed of the second William fitz Alan about 1190.3 Reyner dd Acton, the next in this succession, was probably the person from whom Acton Reynald derived its distinctive name. He is a frequent witness of Deeds which range between the years 1195 and 1220. At the Assizes of 1203 his appearance on Juries of Grand Assize is that of a Knight. He was on that occasion ap pointed one of the custodes or manucaptors of Walter Hussey, sen tenced to purge himself of a charge of murder by wager of battle. At these Assizes Reyner de Acton and Augnes his wife claimed, under writ of mort d'ancestre, half a hide in some place which I cannot determine.4 The Defendant, Herbert fitz Herbert, being in the King's service abroad, the cause was adjourned sine die. Robert de Acton, son and heir of Reyner, is found attesting Deeds, the earliest of which passed in or before 1 224, and the latest of which was before 1240.

One of the three contemporary Rolls of that date, states him to be holding half a knight's-fee in Acton and Grineleshul, in the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 Two other Rolls state the tenure to be in Halekton (Haughton) and Grinsill ;4 and this latter statement is undoubtedly correct, for what Reyner de Acton held in Acton was not held immediately of Fitz Alan, but of the Lords of Stanton. I find no further mention of this second Reyner de Acton. It is evident that he was deceased in 1255, leaving a son or sons under age, the eldest of which sons, probably named Peter, was in ward to Thomas Bottrell.6 Hence the Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 re gisters Acton Reyner as follows : \u2014 \" Thomas Boterel holds in Acton Reyner three hides of geldable land, in the name of wardship; and it is of the fee of John fitz 1 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit.

I find this third Reyner de Acton attesting a Deed which probably passed before 1270. The Assize- Roll of 1272 just adverts to an action of dis seizin brought by Stephen de Aysford against Reyner de Acton for a tenement in Fenemere. Reginald de Atton is at the same time written as sixth Juror for Pimhill Hundred. At the Pimhill In quest of November 1274 Reyner de Actone was third Juror. He occurs on other local Juries in December 1277 and May 1278. The Feodary of 1279 says that \"Acton is held by Reginald de Acton, of the fee of Stanton, and by service of one Muntor for 40 days, at Oswestry, in time of war. The same Reginald holds Fenymer o Richard fitz Alan, immediately.\" In an Inquest of August 1283 Reyner de Acton appears as a Knight, and in an Inquest of December 1285 as one of the Ver derers of the Shropshire Forests. On June 2, 1288, a Quarrel between the Convent of Haghmon, as Rectors, and the Vicar, of Shawbury, of the one part, and Reyner, Lord of Acton Reyner, Knight, of the other part, concerning a Chantry in the Chapel of Acton Reyner, and a virgate of land, and tithes of another virgate in Acton, was thus settled. Sir Reyner conceded the Chapel as subject to the Mother-Church of Shawbury, and quitclaimed the said virgate and tithes to the Abbey. The Abbot in return was to provide a Chaplain to perform divine services in the said Chapel on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. A Fine of October 20, 1292, shows Reyner de Acton alienating Acton Reyner and Grinsill from his name, and I think from his kindred, after his own decease, for ever. \u2014 \" Reyner de Acton, Im pedient, allows his gift to Philip Burnell, Plaintiff, of the Manor of Acton Reyner, and a fourth part of the Manor of Grineleshull. Philip in return concedes the premises to Reyner for life, at a clove rent, and for performance of all capital services ; \u2014 with reversion to Philip and his heirs,\u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee.\" After this I find Sir Reyner de Acton attesting a Hadnall Deed of July 28, 1293.

Before the year 1308 Reyner de Acton was dead, and Edward Burnell was apparently in full seizin of the estates conveyed in re version to his Father, Philip. A parcel of waste land in Grinsill was divisible, and was on February 15, 1308,1 divided between the Abbot of Haghmon and Edward Burnell. Edward Burnell (acting by his Seneschal, Sir Richard de Harley) took one-fourth and the Abbot took three-fourths of the waste, such being their respective shares of the Manor of Grinsill. Richard, Abbot of Haghmon, Richard de Haghton, John de Onysburys, and Adam Crowther were present at the partition. It appears that Acton Reynold and Grinsill were part of those Burnell estates, the fee simple of which went with Petronilla, sister of Philip Burnel, to William de Ercall (IV.) . William de Ercall (V.), son of the said William and Petronilla, must therefore be understood as the William de Ercalewe, who, in the Nomina Vil larum of 1316, stands as \" Lord of the Vill of Acton Reyner and Grinehull.\" Of Undertenants in Acton, the first I shall name is John, son of Richard, son of Edric de Grinsill. Between the years 1250 and 1255 this John gave certain land in Acton Heath to Haghmon Abbey, which lay between the old foss and the duct of Hardwik. He also gave other land, surrounded by a trench, on the opposite side of the road (called Geries-bruge) ; also a parcel of land iu Grileshull which William the Quarryer and the Grantor's father had sometime held. The Abbey was to hold all, under the Grantor, in exchange for a messuage outside the vill (of Grinsill) towards Acton, and for 9| acres in the field of Grinsill. The Grantor would acquit the land conveyed by him of 8c?. rent, payable to the Lord of Acton and his heirs.

Hundred. The latter, on an Ellesmere Jury of the same year, is called Adam fitz William de Acton. From February 1299 to January 1330 I find frequent attesta tions of Richard Gery, of Acton. On March 30, 1326, the Abbot 6*f Haghmon demises a messuage, virgate, and other land in Acton Reyner to Robert de Acton, son of Richard Gery. On July 23, 1335, the Abbot grants to Richard Gery, of Acton Reyner, and Alice his wife, a place of waste on Grinsill Hill, near Sherwode, for their lives, at a rent of 2s. Acton Reynald Chapel. The history of this Chapel, founded as early as the reign of Stephen, has, as a dependency of Shawbury Church, been given already in a former Chapter.1 The agreement which Reyner de Acton (III.) extorted from the Canons of Hagh mon and their Vicar of Shawbury in 1288 seems to have been ob served with unusual strictness. Even in 1535-6 the Canons were paying a salary of 20s. to the officiating Chaplain of Acton Reyner.3 jHttitile. Isdem Rainaldus tenet Mulleht. Seuuardus tenuit T. R. E. Ibi viii hid\u00e6.

It is not probable however that the whole of the Domesday Manor of Middle had been thus given to Le Strange. Alderton, part of Balderton, and that part of Sleap which is in Middle Parish seem to me to have beeD original members of Middle, but to have been separated from it manorially, at a very early period. Before the year 1172 John le Strange (I.) is recorded in a Bull of Pope Alexander (III.) to have given to Haghmon Abbey, the Mill of Mudie and the sites of all his Mills. This munificent grant seems to have wanted completeness as well as permanence. The Feodaries of 1240 differ in making John le Strange's tenure under Fitz Alan to be by 2\u00a3 or by 2 knights'-fees.1 When Middle and Childs Ercall are further designated as the two Manors on which such service was due, they must be taken to represent at least seven Manors2 which were held by Le Strange under Fitz Alan. It is probable that 2| fees was really the service due in 1240 on this Fief, but such matters varied very much, according as scutage, or castle-guard, was the basis of the calculation, to say nothing of the arrangement between Suzerain and Vassal being at any time alter able by joint consent. The very next notice which we have of Le Strange's Fief shows that his service of Castle-Guard was that of four Muntarii, usually equivalent to two Knights. Thus the Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 states that \" John Le Strange holds in the Vill of Mudie five geldable hides of the Fee of John fitz Alan, by service of four Mun tarii for 40 days at Oswestry, both for the said land and for all his lands which he holds of John fitz Alan in Shropshire; and it (Middle) owes suit to County and (to Hundred) at the Sheriff's two Tourns, and pays 20c?. for stretward, but nothing for motfee.\"3 An Inquest taken in January 1272 seems to have referred to the late John fitz Alan's Seigneury over Middle and Ruyton.4 The service of 2\\ knights'-fees, held by John le Strange in Mudell, Ritton, and elsewhere, was now assigned as part of the dower of the said John fitz Alan's widow.5 An Inquest of March 1276, after the death of John le Strange (IV.) states him to have held the Manors 1 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48. which was perhaps such as to exclude them from the above computation. 3 Rot.

The interest of the deceased (John le Strange) therein was valued at \u00a330 per annum.1 The Feodary of 1279 for once apportions the service due upon Middle per se, stating that \" John le Strange (V.) holds Middle with its members immediately of John fitz Alan (sic) by service of ith of a knight's-fee at Oswestry in war-time.\" In October 1292 John le Strange, was subjected to a process of Quo Waranto, as to his alleged exercise of free-warren, infangen thef, and ways, in his Manors of Nesse, Kyngton (Kinton), and Mudie. It seemed that in Middle he only claimed free-warren, so the other franchises were adjudged to the Crown. In regard to Ness and Kinton he claimed all three privileges, and justified himself by the immemorial usage of his Ancestors. The question went to a Jury, which substantiated Johu le Strange's defence.3 On June 25, 1299, this John le Strange, being styled \" of Knu kyn,\" was Deforciant in a conventional Fine, whereby he conceded the Manors of Mudie and Ritton to Ralph de Sherleye, Plaintiff, and his heirs ; \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee. A sum of \u00a340 was the ostensible consideration. By a second Fine of Oct. 6, 1299, Richard de Sherlee, Deforciant, entails the Manor of Mudie on John le Strange, of Knokyn, and Matilda his wife, and the heirs of their bodies, with remainder to the right heirs of John le Strange. A Patent of April 1, 1308, allows John le Strange to fortify and crenellate his Mansion of Medle with a wall of stone and lime. The remains of the castellated mansion, which was thus originated, are still to be seen.3 The Inquest, taken August 20, 1309, on the death of John le Strange (V.), states him to have held Mudie under Edmund, Earl of Arundel.4 It was probably with reference to the entail of 1299 that the In quest, taken Feb. 27, 1311 (on the death of John le Strange (V.)), does not notice Middle, as held by him in fee and demesne. It merely says that he had a certain annual rent of 6s. 8d. from the heir of John de Burgton in Middle.5 This receipt, as distinct from the general entail, I cannot account for.

In 1329 we are sure that Middle had reverted to a branch of the Stranges ; for by a Charter of December 3rd in that year, King Ed ward III. recites a recent Inquisition, whereby it had been found that a loss of 2s. per annum would result to the Crown, if the King were to allow his beloved Valet, John le Strange, to have View- of Frankpledge over his tenants of Medle, and the chattels of felons and fugitives, and fines, and amercements, and the profits on all forfeitures in the said Manor. It had also been found to be non injurious to the Crown if the said John were allowed to have \"ways, infangentheof, outfangentheof, and the return and execution of Writs Royal.\" The King, wishing to do the said John a favour, grants him all the privileges in question, notwithstanding the damages aforesaid.1 I cannot say how this John le Strange was related to Roger le Strange, the contemporary Lord of Knokyn, and the right heir of the former Lords of Middle. I can only add that in 1383 Middle had reverted once more to the elder line, that is, to John le Strange (VIII.) grandson of the said Roger.3 CHURCH OF ST. PETER AT MIDDLE. Four great Churches at the Western extremity of Lichfield Dio cese passed at an early period to the Patronage of Shrewsbury Abbey. It will be useful to deal with them conjunctively, so far as the earlier features of their common history are traceable. They were the Churches of Middle, Great Ness, Baschurch, and Os westry. Earl Roger's Charter to the monks of Shrewsbury, speaking of a time anterior to Domesday, says,-\u2014 Dedi etiam eidem loco ecclesiam de Nessa, et illam de Bassechirche cum omnibus ad easdem ecclesias pertinentibus. Guarinus vero Vicecomes dedit eis ecclesiam de Mutla, cum decima ejusdem vill\u00e6 et ecclesiam Sancti Oswaldi, cum decima ejusdem vill\u00e6. Domesday mentions a Church and Glebe at Nessham, and a Church and Glebe at Bascherche, both held by Shrewsbury Abbey (Ecclesid Sancti Petri). It also mentions a Church and Priest at Meresberie (supposed to be the Domesday representative of Oswestry3), and a 1 Rot. Chart. 3 Edw. III., No. 7. 3 This relation between Meresberie and Oswestry was first pointed out to me by Mr. Joseph Morris, of Shrewsbury. 2 Collectanea Topographia et Oenealo gica, Vol. V. pp. 180, 181."], [511, "69 THE CHURCH. Priest at Mulleht, but says nothing about Shrewsbury Abbey in connection with either place. The reason of this silence has been already suggested under Upton Magna,1 viz. that some of Warin' s grants to the Abbey had not at the time of Domesday been ratified by his successor, Rainald. We shall have further proof of a cognate omission under Albrighton. King William II.'s Charter to the Abbey says : \u2014 Deinde (Comes Rogerius et uxor ejus) contulerunt eis (scilicet, monachis) ecclesiam de Nessa, et illam de Bassecherch, cujus possessiones sunt Prestcota, Noneleia, et Bageleia.\" But this Charter does not name anything at Middle or Oswestry, among the gifts of Warin, or Rainald, or any other. Earl Hugh's spurious Charter to the Abbey says, \u2014 Concessi (eis) decimam dominii (mei) de Oswaldestre, et de Nesse, et de Mulde. Earl Hugh's less suspicious Charter alludes to none ofthe above gifts ; for where it states that \" Warin Vicecomes gave two parts of the tithes of his demesnes of Nesse,\" the allusion is to Little Ness. Henry I.'s Confirmation of 1121 comes next in order. It tells how, \u2014 Rogerius Comes atque Adelaisa Comitissa addiderunt supra dictis donis ecclesiam de Bascerce et illam de Nessa ; and how Rai naldus, qui, post mortem Warini, uxorem illius cum ejus honore sus cepit, et Hugo filius ejusdem Warini dederunt Ecclesiam Sancti Os waldi, et illam de Muthla, et decimas de Nessa et de Seraordina,3 concedente Hugone Comite. King Stephen's Charter is substantively and almost verbally in concert with the above ; nor do the Charters of Henry II. or Henry III. present these grants in any new light. Of Episcopal Charters, the earliest (Bishop Clinton's) only alludes to two-thirds of the demesne tithes of Nesse (Little Ness) as having been given or confirmed in some Charter of Earl Hugh. But a second Charter of the same Prelate confirms \" the Church of Nesse with a pension of 10s., the Church of Album Monasterium, with its Chapels and its pension of 30s., the Church of Bascherch, with its Chapels and its pension of 20s., and the Church of Mudie, with its pension of 6s. 8c?.\"4 Bishop Durdent's Charter5 confirms \" the Church of Nesse with its tithes, the Church of Album Monasterium, with its tithes and its appurtenant Chapels, the Church of Baschirche, with the Church * Or 13*. id. as it stands in one tran script (Harl.

It makes the Pension arising from Baschurch to be 18s., that from Middle to be 6s. 8c?. ; but says nothing of any pensions arising from Oswestry or Ness. Archbishop Peckham's Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey gives 10s. as the Pension from Nesse, 30s. as the Pension from Album Monasterium, 20s. as the Pension from Baschirch, and 13s. 4c?. as the Pension from Middle. On the whole, Middle Church seems to have been a Saxon Foun dation, with a Parish of great extent. It was given primarily by Warin the Bald to Shrewsbury Abbey, and the gift was never dis puted by his Successors, or their Feoffees, the Lords Strange. It had the sanction of Earls, Kings, and Prelates, with some difference indeed as to the form of confirmation, but no obscurity about the essential facts. Middle Church was never appropriated by the Monks of Shrews bury. In the Taxation of 1291, its revenues stood at the then large sum of \u00a320. 10s. per annum, out of which the Monks of Shrews bury drew only a pension of 10s.1 In 1341 the Church-Taxation of Mudie being quoted as \u00a320, the Assessors estimated the Ninth of the Parish at \u00a38 only. The Glebe and small tithes, which went to form the Taxation, were not com putable in estimating a ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb. Moreover five carucates of land lay unfilled in the Parish, and there had been a common murrain of the sheep.3 The Valor of 1535 gives \u00a316 as the gross income of Thomas Tonge, Rector of Middle. Out of this he paid \u00a32 to the Chaplain of Hadnall, a pension of 13s. 4c?. to Shrewsbury Abbey, and 19s. 6c?. for yearly Procurations and Synodals.3 It is difficult to account fully for the diminished value of this Rectory. To say that its Chapels at Ruyton and Petton had be come independent Churches is perhaps giving a partial reason. EARLY INCUMBENTS.

A part of it, viz. one hide, was probably separated from Middle before that estate was given by Fitz Alan to Le Strange. It was annexed, together with that part of Sleap which was another member of Middle, to the Fee of Hussey ; \u2014 that is, Hussey of Al bright Hussey held a hide in Balderton and half a hide in Sleap, immediately under Fitz Alan, and never, that I can learn, mediately under Le Strange. But half a hide in Balderton went, together with Middle, to the first John le Strange, and his Undertenant thereof was Leolwine the Hunter. On the death or escheat of Leolwine, and about the year 1175, John le Strange (I.) enfeoffed one William fitz Walter in Shelvock (a member of Ruyton or Wykey), and also in two virgates at Balderton. His Charter runs as follows. \u2014 Omnibus amicis suis et hominibus suis Salopesbiri\u0153, tarn futuris quam presentibus , Johannes Extraneus salutem. Notum vobis f ado, et scriptur\u00e6 testimonio confirmo, me dedisse Shelf hoc, cum omnibus pertinenciis, et duas virgatas terr\u00e6 in Balderton, qu\u00e6 fuerunt Leolwini Venatoris, Willielmo filio Walteri et heredibus suis, libere et quiete istas duas terras tenendas de me et heredibus meis, an nuatim reddendo, pro omni servicio, quasdam ocreas de cordubano cum calcaribus deauratis.

Witness, \u2014 Guy le Strange.\" Not long afterwards John le Strange (II.) confirmed William fitz Walter's grant and Charter, speaking of the said William as his Father's Feoffee.

Late in the reign of Edward IL, as I think, the Abbot got a Quitclaim of all right or challenge, in respect of any lands at Balderton, from John Lord of Shelvak, whom I take to have been a descendant of William fitz Walter above mentioned. This Quit claim was attested by Sir William de Ercalue and Sir John de Lee, knights ; by Richard Hord of Walleford, Richard de Pectone, Roger de Letone, Stephen de Roshale, and Richard Gery of Actone. On Oct. 25, 1333, Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon, and Sir John le Strange, \" Lord of Mudie,\" adjusted certain differences. Sir John was to allow a certain flow of water to escape down the usual course from the Vivary of Middle. The Abbot was to facilitate the annexation to Middle Park of two wastes called Hethilyghe and Webblescou-lone, without interference of himself or his Tenants at Balderton or Webblescoue. Witnesses, \u2014 Richard Hord of Walle forth, William Banastre, Richard Huse, Roger Banastre, and Rich ard de WaReford. On Dec. 5, 1334, the same parties had a second agreement. \u2014 Abbot Nicholas covenanted that Sir John and his heirs should enclose and hold in severalty the following parcels of land, viz. Bromehurste, Slepe-gorstes, Gorsthurst, Bilemerspoll, and the Halghfeld. Sir John allows that the Cattle of the Abbot, and of his Tenants at Balderton and Webblescoue, shall not be impounded for trespass where the fences were ill-kept. He also secures the Abbot's peaceable enjoyment of common rights throughout the Manor of Middle except in the Park, &c. As to Undertenants in the Abbot of Haughmond's estate at Balderton, the five following Surrenders and Deeds seem to have taken place between 1216 and 1230. \u2014 William de Balderton, who occurs in 1228,2 was it seems, son of Adam de Balderton. So describing himself, he sells to the Abbey, in augmentation of the gate-alms of Haghmon, with consent of his heir Richard, and for a sum of \u00a32. 15s., a messuage, croft, and 15 acres, which Richard fitz Clarice sold to him.

Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Thomas de Rossale, Sir Vivian his son. The last Deed probably passed after the middle of the 13th cen tury, as did a Deed whereby the Abbot of Haghmon concedes to Thomas fitz Roger, of Yorton, and Roysia, daughter of Helias de Newbolt, his wife, a messuage and half-virgate in Balderton, which Richard fitz Clarice (formerly) held. A rent of 3s. is reserved to the Abbey, and one of 2d. to Henry le Husee and his heirs. Witness, \u2014 Sir Thomas de Rossall. The Account, already given under Hadnall,1 is probably inclusive of the Haughmond receipts from Balderton and Webscott. Hussey's Fee in Balderton. This was a hide of land which, together with half a hide in Sleap, was held by Hussey, of Albright Hussey, under Fitz Alan : and, as I have already stated, Hussey's feoffment in these members of Middle was probably anterior to Le Strange's feoffment in the central Manor. About 1230-50, Walter Hussey (of Albrighton) had, it seems, a Tenant here, viz. Richard, son of William de Balderton. The said Richard and his heirs acknowledge by Deed that \" they can neither give, nor demise for a term, the land which they hold under Walter Hose in Balderton, in any way so as to injure the said Walter or his heirs.\"3 The Husseys of Albrighton afterwards enfeoffed a branch of their 1 Supra, pp. 59, 60. - Harl.

Hence the Hundred-Roll says that \" Henry Hesee holds one hide in Balderton and half a hide in Slepe ; and the estate is of the fee of Thomas Hesee's heir. It owed the service of a third part of a knight's-fee at Oswestry ; did suit to County and Hundred, and paid 12c?. for stretward and motfee.\"1 At the Assizes of 1272 Henry Huse was one of the Jurors for Pimhill Hundred. Moreover, Henry Hose, as tenant of a messuage and virgate in Baldreton, Avelina de Hadenhale, as tenant of 2s. rent in Hadnall, William Banastre, as tenant of 5s. rent in Smethe ton (Smethcott), and Robert fitz Matthew, of Eyton, as tenant ot 2s. rent in Eyton juxta Alberbury, were all impleaded for the same by Thomas de Oveton, as heir of Richard de Oveton, his uncle. It was proved, however, that Richard had not died seized of the premises, he having enfeoffed his son Nicholas in the same, before he died. Before 1279 Henry Hussey, of Balderton, had been succeeded by John Hussey. The latter is entered on the Pimhill Tenure-Roll as holding one hide in Adbrigton (Balderton is meant) under John Hussey of Adbrighton by service of one-third of a kuight's-fee at Oswestry, in wartime, on behalf of the last-named John. John Hussey, of Balderton, occurs as a witness or Juror iu 1291 and 1293. On April 1, 1324, Thomas Husee, of Balderton, surrendered to Haghmon Abbey all the lands he held under it in Balderton. Sleap Parva. In 1255 we have seen that half a hide in Sleap was held by Henry Hussey, of Balderton, under John Hussey, of Albrighton, who held immediately of Fitz Alan. The Tenure-Roll of 1279 indicates a totally different arrangement, making Roger (or Reyner) de Slepe to hold the vill of Slepe under Thomas de Rossall by service of 10s. per annum. There is an analogous appearance, in the case of Wollascot, of De Rossall having at this time engrossed a part of Hussey's Fee ; so that we need not doubt the fact of a like change in the case of Sleap. Of course Fitz Alan was still Seigneural Lord of Sleap, though the Record does not say so. On November 3, 1292, a fine was levied, which shows that the part of Sleap which was, or rather had been, a member of Middle, was called Parva Sleap.\u2014\" Vivian de Rossall (Impedient) allows a gift of 10 acres of meadow in Parva Slepe to Thomas de Rossall i Rot.

This member of Middle undoubtedly passed with the central Manor to John le Strange (I.). I have stated under Berrington the particulars of a grant, whereby the said John gave before 1172, and confirmed in 1177-8,1 half a virgate in Webbles cowe to Haghmon Abbey. The following may well be a confirmation of John le Strange (II), between 1178 and 1180, and shortly after his father's death. As \"John Extraneus,\" he gives and confirms to the Abbey a half virgate in Webblescowe, with commou pasture throughout the fee of Mudie for the live stock of the Abbot's tenants at Balderton and Webblescowe.

For this the Grantee paid 10 merks. The subsequent interest of Haughmond Abbey in Webscott has been traced under Hadnall. There was also a small estate at Webscott, belonging to Lilleshall Abbey. It was given by John le Strange (II.) , and, according to the Rubric of the Lilleshall Chartulary, was a sort of composition or atonement for some act of homicide. Between the years 1225 and 1232, and probably in his Father's lifetime, John le Strange (III) ratified this gift in a Charter, of which I transcribe the title and principal contents : \u2014 Carta Domini Johannis Extranei de terra de Webbleschoue, data domui de Lilleshull pro morte cujusdam hominis. \u2014 Johannes filius Johannis Extranei dedi, fye, unam virgatam in Weblescoue, quam Walterus filius Galfridi tenuit, et quam pater meus (Canonicis) illis donavit tn liberam elemosynam, ita quod eundem Walterum Abbati et Conventui assignavi.

Richard's son, a second John, gave Thorneforde Mill to John le Strange (probably John le Strange the fifth) in exchange for a virgate and two mes suages in Marton. This John, styling himself \"son of Richard de la Mere,\" and \" Lord of Mere,\" gave the said messuages and virgate in frank marriage with Margery, his eldest daughter, to Wil liam, son of John de Haueston; \u2014 to hold in fee, to them and their bodily heirs, paying a penny rent to John le Strange. The only hints I can give for the date of this Deed are that William, son of John de Haueston, has occurred to us in 1292 under Haston, and that John de la Mere appears on local Juries in January and De cember 1291. John le Strange (V.) thus obtained Thorneforde Mill, and trans mitted it to his son,\" John le Strange (VI.) ; for it must have been the latter who, as Lord of Knokyn, mortgaged his \"Mill of La Mere, alias Thorneforde Mill,\" to Haughmond Abbey for \u00a340. This mortgage is undated, but the witnesses thereof, viz. William Horde (Le Strange's Seneschal) and Richard Horde, are appointed to give the Abbot seizin in a contemporary Writ, which purports to be dated on \" Friday, in the feast of the Circumcision, 4 Edward III.,\" and which Writ is attested by Sir Hamo, brother of the Ex peditor of the Writ. \u2014 I need hardly point out that January 1, 1331, fell on a Tuesday, 1 The original Deed, at Trentham ; and Lilleshall Chartulary, fos. 55, 93."], [520, "78 MIDDLE. or that the Lord of Knokyn at that period was Roger le Strange.

It would seem that Marton Pool was next called Bassmere. \u2014 On September 30, 1324, the Abbot of Haghmon concedes to Stephen de Felton his fishery and mere of Bassmere, for life, at a rent of 6s. 8c?., and reserving power to distrain for the same on Stephen's Tenants at Felton (West Felton), Tedesmere, and Weston Lullingfields. Meanwhile John le Strange (VI.) dying in the same month in which the above mortgage would seem to have been dated, had been succeeded by his son John le Strange (VII.) ; and the latter dying without issue in 1323, had been succeeded by his brother, Roger. Between 1323 and 1325, the latter as \"Roger le Strange of Knokin \" released and quitclaimed to the Abbey all his right in Thorneford-Mill, with the Fishery of the Lake of Bassemere, which Mill and Fishery his Father John le Strange formerly had mortgaged to the Abbey. Witnesses, Sir William de Ercalwe and Sir John de Lee, knights ; Master Robert de Prestone, Clerk ; Richard Hord of Walleford; Richard his son; William Banastre; William Chap man of Eyton. On July 30, 1340, Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon, demises to John Blays of Marton the above Mill and Fishery, situate near the Vill of Marton, for his life, at a rent of 15s. Again on May 19, 1462, Abbot Richard demises to Thomas Warde of Baschurch, his Vivary of Bassemere near Marton, which John Baker Senior of Fennemere once held, together with the Fishery at the outlet of the said Vivary, so that there be no impediment of the watercourse to the Abbot's Mill of Thorneford.

As yet however we have not seen Fitz Warin enfeoffed by Fitz Alan, though the Barons of Caus, of Pulverbatch, and of Holgate, have each been ascertained to have lent a hand in the establishment of a House which had no Domesday antecedents to support it. At Alderton however, a member of Middle, Fitz Alan will have furnished his quota to the advancement of Warin de Metz ; \u2014 I say of Warin de Metz himself, for the enfeoffment must have been old enough for such a supposition.1 So Alderton was already separated from Middle, when Le Strange became endowed with the central Manor. In the time of King Richard I., the second Fulk fitz Warin sold Alderton to Reyner de Lee, who held the neighbouring vill of Lee (now Lee Hall) under Lilleshull Abbey. This was transacted, not by any Deed of Fulk fitz Warin himself, but by a Charter of the Lord Paramount, WTilliam fitz Alan (II), whose Deed on the sub ject must needs be dated in 1195-6. This is far too important a Document to give in any other form than the nearly original one in which it has been preserved. \u2014 Willielmus filius Willielmi filii Alani, omnibus Christi fidelibus ad quos presens charta pervenerit salutem.

It was however uniformly reputed to contain only two hides. A probable reason may be given for such a diminution ; for two of the four Domesday hides were ungeldable, and therefore might easily become obsolete in Re cords which were mainly intended as Registers of the fiscal and civil liabilities of Manors. As to Herbert, Rainald's Domesday Tenant in half of Albrighton, his name occurs nowhere else in Domesday, nor yet in any other Record. The first Hussey of whom I find mention was \u2014 Walter Hussey, living in 1165. The Liber Niger calls him Walter Hosatus, and gives him a knight's-fee of new feoffment in the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 This precludes all idea of the Husseys being traceable to any Domesday origin. It is probable that Walter Hussey's Fee included not only Albright Hussey and its member Harlescott, but parts of Balderton and Sleap, theretofore members of Middle. It was probably soon after the death of his Feoffor, the first William fitz Alan, that is about 1160-5, that Walter Hussey made the following grant to Lilleshull Abbey. \u2014 As \" Walter de Hose \" he appears as giving one parcel (locum) of his land of Herlaveschot (Harlascott), which lay between the arable land ofthe said vill and the land of Henechot. The gift was to enable the Canons (to whom Hencott belonged) to erect a stank. The Grantor gave it \"for the soul of the Lord William fitz Alau ; and in the presence and with the consent of Ralph, the Grantor's son and heir.\"3 Walter Hussey left two sons Ralph and William. Of William, the younger, as second husband of Leticia, heiress of Hadnall,, we have already heard. We have also heard of \u2014 Ralph Hussey, the elder son, as a tenant in capite at Ightfield, and as occurring in 1176 and 1204.4 He had succeeded his Father in 3 Lilleshull Chartulary, so. 56. *\u25a0 Supra, Vol. IX. pp. 208, 209. 1 Domesday, fo. 255, 1, a and b. 2 Liber Niger, I. 144.

Again in 1183 the Sheriff accounts for half a merk, an amercement set upon Ralph Hose for some act of disseizin. I refer back to several attestations of Ralph Hose, ranging be tween the years 1175 and 1204.1 In two instances he is accom panied by his brother WTilliam. As Jurors of Grand Assize, and as presumptively Knights, Ralph occurs in Easter Term 1200, and both Ralph and William in October 1203. In 1203-4 we have seen Ralph Hussey acting as one of the Manucaptors of his son Walter, accused of the murder of WTido de Shawbury. Walter Hussey (II), escaping, as I conceive, from this charge, occurs in succession to his father at Ightfield in 1211. His attes tation of a Charter given under Hodnet3 is perhaps five years earlier. The Rubric of a Lilleshall Charter accurately entitles this Walter as Walter, junior, Hose. The reference is to his Grandfather. In the Charter itself, \" Walter Hose, son of Ralph Hose, confirms to the Lilleshull Canons their stank of Haremore, as founded upon his land of Harlaveschot, together with the land enclosed by a foss which had been made between his land and the aforesaid Mere (Hencott Pool), down to the boundaries of the land of Bere wick.\" On June 11, 1235, Walter Husee attests an agreement between Henry, Abbot of Shrewsbury, and Alan le Poer, of Wollascott. The Feodary of 1240 gives Walter Hozey as holding half a knight's-fee in Adbritton of the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 It would seem therefore that the service due on Hussey's Fee had been reduced one-half. Very soon after this, if we may judge by his attestation of a Hard wick Deed,4\u2014 Thomas Hussey had succeeded to Walter. This Thomas was deceased in 1255, leaving his son and heir, \u2014 John Hussey, in minority. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll, in de scribing the Manor now under notice as \" Harlauscote,\" puts a part for the whole. \u2014 \u00ab It says that \" Dame Margery de Lacy5 holds two hides of land in Harlauscote, in the way of wardship.\" The estate was of the Fee of 1 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 106 ; Vol. VII. p. 321; and Vol. IX. p. 323. 4 Supra, page 49. 5 Margery de Lacy I take to have been the aged widow of Walter de Lacy, who died in 1241.

John Huse was in 1301 Manucaptor of Thomas de Roshall, re turned as Knight of the Shire for Salop. By an Inquest of 1310 it was found to be non-injurious to the Crown if Robert de Buck enhale and Cecily, his wife, were to give 3 virgates and 3 messuages in Albrighton Husee and Harlascote to Shrewsbury Abbey. The premises were held by a rent of 8s. 4d. under John Husee, of Ad brighton, who held of the Earl of Arundel, who held of the King.4 A coeval Fine shows that Abbot WiRiam paid \u00a340 for the purchase. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 John Huse is entered as Lord of the ViR of Adbrihton Huse.5 He occurs as a witness seven years later, but more I cannot say of him.

Abbot of Buildwas, R. Abbot of Hageman, and R.

In dominio est i carruca ; et mi servi, et n Villani, et m Bordarii cum i car rucd. Ibi Molinum dexsolidis. Valebat xv solidos: modo xxx solidos.\" My reason for combining the two Manors of Rosshall and Eyton in one Chapter is because they were contiguous, and because their common tenure soon caused them to be named by a single name, that of Rosshall. The site of Eyton was probably that curious peninsula which the devious course of the Severn has traced out to the north-west of Shrewsbury. The name Eyton, always asso ciated with circumfluent water, was appropriate to the locality. Though the vill of Eyton has been lost for centuries, the name is substantively preserved in the allusive title of The Isle. Hugh fitz Albert, a descendant of the Domesday Albert, ap pears between 1155 and 1160 attesting a Charter of the first Wil liam fitz Alan.3 In the Liber Niger of 1165 we find Hugh fitz Albert holding the fees of one knight and 3^ Muntators, of old feoffment in the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 The tenure, equal to 2f knights'-fees, was not merely in Rosshall, Eyton, and Welsh Hampton, but probably included estates at Middleton (near Bridgnorth), at Withyford, and other places. It need not be assumed that this Hugh was son of the Domes day Albert. It is much more probable (and this would be quite consistent with the nomenclature of the period) that he was his grandson or great-grandson. About Easter 1170 Hugh fitz Albert having previously died, his son, caRed Warin fitz Hugh, seems to have had livery of his in heritance. This I take to be the real meaning of an entry on the Pipe-Roll of 1170, when Guy le Strange was Custos ofthe Honour of William fitz Alan, deceased. The said Custos deducts 20s., or half a year's revenue of the land of Roshala, which the King had restored to Guarin fitz Hugh.4 It is obvious that Rosshall had been in the King's hand as Custos of Fitz Alan's heir, and there is no other way of accounting for this minor escheat in Fitz Alan's Barony than by supposing the contemporary minority of the Heir of Rosshall. 3 Liber Niger, I. 143. 1 Domesday, fo. 255, a. 2. 4 Sot. Pipe, 16 Hen. IL, Salop. 1 Supra, page 45."], [530, "88 ROSSHALL AND THE ISLE. In all later years of Guy le Strange's trust, down to 1175, he deducts at the rate of \u00a32 yearly, in quietantid terr\u00e6 de Roshalle quam Rex reddidit Warino filio Hugonis. It is all but certain that the person here called Warin fitz Hugh was afterwards known only as \u2014 Vivian de Roshall. There is however nothing common in the language or derivation of the two names Warin and Vivian, nor do I know of any other instance where they have been thus inter changed. The first occurrence of Vivian de Roshall, under that name, is in the Court of King Richard I., on January 24, 1J90.1 At the Shropshire Assizes of 1203 he appears as a Knight and a Juror in Grand-Assizes. At the Forest- Assizes of 1209 his Fine of 3 merks, that he might have quittance with regard to some Suretiship, is entered as if he were a Staffordshire man. His brother Ralph was one of those Rebels against King John who were taken prisoners at the siege of Carrickfergus in 1210. He seems to have endured a captivity of some years, for it is not till 18 March, 1215, that Vivian procured his enlargement by a Fine of 40 merks. A Patent of that date, addressed to the Constable of Sarum, orders his liberation. If Vivian de Roshall had livery as early as 1170 we are not sur prised at finding his attestations from about 1217 to about 1233 so frequently followed by those of Thomas his son. At the Assizes of 1221 Sir Vivian appears again as one of the knightly Jurors who tried causes of importance. At these Assizes, viz. on Nov. 3, 1221, Vivian de Roshal, tenant of a carucate of land in Udelendun,2 gave 40s. to Roger de Gyros for abandoning his claim thereto. A Writ-close of December 1225 shows Vivian de Roshall as a Commissioner for collecting the tax of the fifteenth in Salop and Staffordshire. Again a Patent of June 7, 1233, shows him as a commissioner for collecting the tax of the fortieth in Shropshire, and as having paid an instalment thereof into the King's Wardrobe on the previous day at Wenlock. His age at this time cannot have been short of 80, unless indeed I have been speaking of two persons under one name. At present however any proof of such a change from father to son is wholly wanting. The Pipe-Roll of the year 1235 shows that \u2014 Thomas de Rossall and Robert de Wodenton had been Com- 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 12. 2 This is Hudlington"], [531, "ROSSHALL AND THE ISLE. 89 missioners to assess a tallage in Shropshire. The collective infer ence from the Feodaries of 1240 is that Thomas de Rossall was then holding 1| knights'-fees in Rosshall and its appurtenances, of the Barony of Fitz Alan.1 At Oxford on May 10, 1247, the Abbot of Combermere im pleaded Thomas de Roshal for causing a horse of the Abbot to be seized. Robert Gener, Provost of Roshal, was the Defendant's Attorney, and the case was adjourned. I know not whether it was for this matter that in November 1248 Roger de Thurkelby, being in eyre at Salop, set the heavy fine of 15 merks on Thomas de Roshal pro transgressione. Even earlier than this, the attestations of Sir Thomas de Rosshall are followed by those of Sir Vivian his son. In March 1255 Thomas de Roshall and Henry de Haleweton were appointed, by Patent, Receivers of the sums arising from the sale of timber in the Shropshire Forests. The Hundred- Rolls, a Record of the ensuing summer, show the two Commissioners in circumstantial discharge of their trust. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll evidently includes the Aitone of Domesday, under the heading of Roshale. It says that \" Thomas de Roshall holds three hides, geldable, in Roshale. It is of the fee of John fitz Alan. He holds it by service of one knight at Oswestry in wartime. He owes suit to County and Hundred, and pays 2s. yearly for stretward and motfee.\"2 The latest that I find of Thomas de Roshall is on a commission to rearrange a truce between King Henry III. and Lewellyn. He went for that purpose with Adam de Brington (Brimton) and Hoel ap Madoc to the Ford of Montgomery, and in 1261 the Sheriff paid the three \u00a37. 10s. for their expenses. About the same time Sir Thomas de Roshal appears attesting a Deed, as Seneschal of Oswestry. Several other attestations of Sir Thomas de Roshall must be dated later than 1255 ; but before 1263 he had been succeeded by his son and heir, \u2014 Vivian de Roshall (II), to whom with John fitz Alan and John de Chetwynd, a Patent of April 29, 1263, extends the usual protection, while they were abiding in the parts of Wales with Prince Edward. A Letter of the second John fitz Alan, dated at Winchester on Sept. 21, 1265, is addressed to his faithful and beloved Sir Fynyan de Roshalle, Constable of Oswestry. 1 Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 47, 49.

About 1290-1 he married Nesta, widow of Roger Corbet of Chetton. She must have been his second wife.1 At the Assizes of 129-2 he was one of the Elizors for Pimhill Hundred and a Juror in cases of Quo Waranto. In 1297 he was returned as holding \u00a320 of lands or rents, and as summoned to attend muster at London on July 7, prepared with horses and arms for foreign service. In the same year two Writs are addressed to him as a Commissioner of Levies in South Wales and in Shropshire. On March 6, 1300, he attended a Parliament at Westminster, as one of the Knights of the Shire returned for Salop. In May following he was appointed one of the Justices of Oyer and Terminer for the same County ;3 and in June he officiated as a Juror on the Great Perambulation of Shropshire Forests. In January 1301 he attended a Parliament at Lincoln as a Knight of the Shire for Shropshire. In June following he had a military summons to serve against the Scots. In October 1302 he once more sat in Parliament as a Knight ofthe Shire. In 1306 he was appointed a Collector in Salop of the Aid for knighting Prince Ed ward.3 Vivian, his brother, who follows him in a testing-clause of the same year, seems to have had property in Yorkshire.3 In 1307, 1308, and 1310 several Writs are addressed to Thomas de R,osshall as a Conservator of the Peace in Herefordshire. A Writ of Diem clausit, dated Dec. 13, 1310, announces the death of Thomas de Rossehall, as of a Tenant-in-capite.

The principal features of the estate were a Capital messuage, a small wood, a W^atermill (worth one merk), and a Windmill (worth half a merk yearly). The rents of free tenants were worth 30s. Thomas, son and heir of the deceased, was aged 27 years, on August 1, 1310.1 Thomas de Roshall (III) appears as a Knight in May 1314. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 he is entered as Lord of Preston- Gobald and Roshall. As a Knight of the Shire for Salop, he was returned to the several Parliaments of 1316, 1319, and 1322. As a Commissioner of Levies or Array he is addressed in Writs of 1316 and 1322, onewhile acting in Shropshire, onewhile in Northampton shire, and against the remains of the Lancastrian faction. In May 1324 he was returned from the three Counties of Shropshire, Northamptonshire, and Bedfordshire, as summoned to attend a Great Council impending at Westminster.3 The elder male line of the Rosshalls eventually vanished in Coheiresses, one of whom took the estate to the Englefields. Of Undertenants in Roshall I need only notice Robert de Roshal, who dying before November 1221, left a daughter, Alice, whose guardian, one Roger, gave her estate, viz. a noke in Roshal, to his own son William. Alice sued William for the same at the Assizes of 1221, and though his guardian endeavoured to postpone the suit on account of William's minority, it was tried. The Jury found the facts as above, viz. that Roger had died seized de custodia, not de feodo, and that Robert, Alice's father, had died seized de feodo. They added that Roger was base-born, an argument I presume against his asserted tenure-in-fee. William fitz Roger was spared any amercement because of his minority. ROSSHALL CHAPEL.

Montfort in turn sold his interest to Hamo le Strange, the great Royalist of 1264-5. The Seigneury still re mained with Fitz Alan, as an Inquest of 1272, calling the place Henton, seems to have shown.3 Meantime Hamo le Strange had enfeoffed his brother Roger, in both Ellesmere, Coolmere, and Hampton. Roger retained seizin of all three, till Adam de Chet wynd, then Escheator for Cheshire, ejected him. This induced Roger to petition the Crown; and a Writ of Edward L, dated March 3, 1274, caused the Inquest from which the above informa tion has been derived.3 Henton, the Jurors added, was of the Fee of Sir John fitz Alan. There can be no doubt that, as Ellesmere was conditionally restored to Roger le Strange, so Hampton became his again by a surer title, and went to his heirs. The Pimhill Te nure-Roll of 1279 says that \" Roger le Strange owes Hampton immediately of John (sic) fitz Alan, by service of one knight's-fee at Oswestry for 15 days in wartime.\" On Nov. 4, 1280, an Extent of Roger le Strange's Manor of Hampton valued it at \u00a33. 14s. 2c?. per annum.

Its place seems to have been sup plied by a more independent foundation. \u2014 This second Chapel was founded in the year 1391 by John, son of Madoc de Kynaston, \" to the honour of God, of the blessed Virgin Mary, and the most blessed Confessor St. Leonard.\" The foundation was with full consent of \" Roger de Hampton, Per petual Vicar of the Parish Church of St. Mary of Ellesmere,\" as his Deed, dated at Ellesmere on April 6, 1391, more fully declares.

The following were all Incumbents of the original Chapel, viz. that which existed before John de Kynaston's fouudation : \u2014 Robert Dros, Rector thereof, died Dec. 26, 1328. Sir John de Ellesmere, Chaplain, was admitted Oct. 9, 1329, at the presentation of the Lady Isabella, Queen of England.3 He died Sept. 26, 1349 (probably of the pestilence). On Dec. 2 fol lowing \u2014 Edmund de Burgton, Clerk, was admitted at presentation of \" Sir Roger le Straunge, Lord of Knokyn and of Ellesmere, knight.\" The Diocesan Registers do not appear to furnish any later pre sentations ; nor is the Chapel mentioned in Henry VIII.'s Valor. i2l)ratoartiitt.e. \" Isdem Rainaldus tenet Saleurdine. \u00c6li tenuit T.

The next tidings which we have of the place is that Rainald Vicecomes and Hugh son of Wrarin Vicecomes concurred in giving the tithes of Seraordina to Shrewsbury Abbey. Henry II.'s Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey, passing in 1155, records a gift of one Fulco Pincerna, viz. half a tract of unfilled ground (dimidium heremum) in the wood of Seraordina. I cannot say who Fulco Pincerna was, nor do I find the Abbey subse quently possessed of land in Shrawardine. It must have been at least as early as the reign of Henry I., that Shrawardine was discerned to be a fitting spot for one of those Fortresses which constituted a second or interior line of de fence against Welsh aggression, or of safe rendezvous for the English Marchers. Thus, while Oswestry, Knokyn, Carrechova, and Whit tington were the more advanced posts of border warfare, the Castles of Shrawardine, Ellesmere, and Ruyton lay more in the rear. Of the relative antiquity of Shrawardine Castle I believe that there is only one documentary proof. In the year 1165 Philip Helgot, acknowledging his service of castle-guard as returnable at Shrawardine, says expressly that it was \" the same as his Ante cessors had been used to render.\"3 Moreover it would appear that, though this Castle was founded in Fitz Alan's Fief, it was founded by the Crown. Certainly during the first century of its existence, it was held, repaired, victualled, and garrisoned by the Crown, without any interest or obligation of Fitz Alan being apparent in the matter. The proof of these statements will constitute the earlier history of Shrawardine Castle. \u2014 In December 1164 Geoffrey de Vere was appointed Sheriff of Shropshire, while Guy le Strange, the preceding Sheriff, continued to be Custos of Fitz Alan's estates. In July 1165 King Henry II. encamped at Oswestry, intending an attack on North Wales. It is the Sheriff, and not the Custos, who at the following Michael mas charges the Crown with a sum of \u00a36, which he had dis bursed to 50 Servientes at Suewardin. Again, as a later Pipe-Roll informs us, the Sheriff, between Michaelmas 1165 and April 23, 1166, disbursed a sum of \u00a362. -Is. 4c?. to 100 Servientes \"of Shrawardine and of the March.\"3 3 The pay will be found to be about 5rf. a week to each man. 1 Domesday, fo. 255, a, 1. \u2022 Supra, Vol. III. p. 177."], [538, "96 SHRAWARDINE. In 1171 the Sheriff, in obedience to a King's Writ, had ex pended \u00a310. 18s. 4e?. on the works of the Castle of Schrawurdi. A similar charge of \u00a38. Ils. 8c?. is made in 1172. At Michaelmas 1187 we have an infallible proof of Royal occupation. \u2014 The She riff charges 19s. Ic?. for repairing the King's House in Srwardin Castle. Once in King Richard's reign, viz. in 1195, the Sheriff charges the Crown with 50s. expended in repairs of Shrawardine Castle, by order of Archbishop Hubert (then Justiciar of England). Sim ilar repairs are charged against King John, in 1204, 1205, and 1207. In the years 1211-2 we hear of no less than ten Feudatories of the Crown, who held their lands by Serjeantry and service, re turnable at Shrawardine Castle. Their tenures were at Ryton, Brockton, Stockton, Hatton, Quat, Ightfield (places in the East of Shropshire), or at Ashley-upon-Tern (in Staffordshire) . Subsequent Records indicate that Eaton-upon-Tern, Cherrington, Chesthill, Longslow, and Sandford, also owed services of Castle-guard at Shrawardine. In every instance it is observable that the localities or persons liable, were in no way connected with the Fief of Fitz Alan. The Escheats of the Crown, accruing since Domesday, had been made available for the due maintenance of this important Fortress. In the years 1212 and 1214 I again observe the Sheriff of Shrop shire charging the Crown with repairs at Shrawardine Castle. Nevertheless I think that at this time there is an appearance at least of Fitz Alan's title to both the Castle and estate being recognized by the Crown. William fitz Alan (II.) had died in 1210, leaving his son in minority. King John's Writ of June 10, 1213 (al ready quoted1) speaks of the Castles of Oswestry and Shrawardine as if they were trusts contingent to the Crown, as having the wardship of young Fitz Alan, not as matters of direct interest. Moreover, on Nov. 10 of the same year, King John's presentation to Shrawardine Church is expressly stated to be in his right of ward ship. A Patent of King Henry III., dated Feb. 7, 1220, directs the men of Staffordshire to give aid to Henry de Audley in forti fying or rebuilding Shrawardine Castle (ad castrum de Srewardin firmandum) . A second Writ of King Henry III.'s, dated May 4, 1221, makes it clear, not only that Shrawardine Castle was no more a Royal 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 247."], [539, "ANTIQUITIES OF SHROPSHIRE BY THE REV.

Shrawardine Castle had probably been razed by the Welsh in their prosperous march against Shrewsbury in 1215. The Crown, declining to rebuild it, deprived it of all its feudal accessories, and appropriated the services, anciently due at Shrawardine, to Mont gomery,2 or else commuted them for some other form of Serjeantry. Shrawardine was once more left to its hereditary Lords, the Fitz Alans ; and there can be no doubt that they rebuilt the Castle. In my account of the Barony of Fitz Alan many allusions have been made to the Castle aud Manor of Shrawardine. It would seem that the Castle was again standing at the death of John fitz Alan (I) in 1240.3 Him therefore we must accept as its second Founder. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 exhibits Shrawardine as having lost one-fourth of its Domesday hidage, but as having extra ordinary franchises. \" Sir John fitz Alan holds in Schiewardin \\\\ hides, not geldable ; and he holds it in capite of the Lord King, as parcel of his Barony of Oswestry, and he affirms himself to have a franchise (Ubertatem) and free-warren.\"* The Inquest taken at Oswestry on June 25, 1272, after the death of John fitz Alan (III), is so defaced as not to allow any com prehension of what it says as to the extent of Serewardin.5 However we know that, with a small reservation, the Manor was allotted to the dower of his widow, Isabel de Mortimer.6 The Pimhill Tenure- Roll of 1279 says that \" Isabella de Mortimer holds the Manor of Schrawardine, with its members, of the King in capite, in the name of dower, and it pertains to the Barony of Oswestry, and is geldable.\" When we compare this entry with some remarks of the great Antiquary who has identified Shrawardine Castle with Castle-Isabel,7 5 Calend.

Shrawardine Castle was occupied by her son, Richard, Earl of Arundel, before he had attained the age of manhood ; for a Deed of his, which passed in March 1292, is dated at Schyreveworthdin.1 In the same year the Earl was questioned for the exercise of certain franchises iu Shrawardine and other Manors. His defence to the Writ of Quo Waranto has been given under Upton Magna.2 An Inquest taken at Shrawardine on May 19, 1302, after the death of Richard, Earl of Arundel, states that Manor to have been held in capite for a knight's-fee. The Castle was not deemed of any annual value. The late Earl's demesnes consisted of 80 acres of arable land, 6 acres of meadow, and 40 acres of bosc. The free tenants paid \u00a32. 10s. 7d. rents; the Villeins \u00a35. 16s. Ic?. ; the Cottars 4s. 4c?.; and ten tenements of half a virgate each were let for \u00a34. Ensdon and Forton are both accounted members of Shrawardine. The annual income, from Shrawardine and Upton Magna combined, was \u00a333. 18s. 5c?. Tradition tells of a young Fitz Alan, who, through the careless ness of his nurse or his own temerity, fell from the battlements of Shrawardine Castle, and so perished. Neither name nor date is assigned to a circumstance, sufficiently credible in itself, and showing the state of a district where females and infants might not visit field or wood, even for the purposes of ordinary recreation. Ensdon is usually accounted a member of Shrawardine. It con stituted part of the dower assigned to Hawise, widow of the first John fitz Alan, in 1240; but in 1272 (when Shrawardine generally was assigned in dower to Isabel, widow of the third John fitz Alan) the rents of Edeneston, a member of Shrawardine, were excepted. They amounted to \u00a36. 7s. 9|</., and were allotted to the King as Guardian of young Richard fitz Alan.3 We have seen that, later in the same year, the King made over these identical rents to Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore.4 In 1302 the specific rents of Edeneston, a member of Shrawar dine, were \u00a34.

The reason which I have assigned for such an anomaly in the cases of Badger, Beckbury, Madeley, and Little Wenlock,1 does not hold good here. The \u00e6ra of the arrangement is too old even for antiquarian speculation. Domesday mentions neither Church nor Priest at Shrawardine, and I cannot hesitate to say that the district then belonged to the Mother Church of Alberbury, though south of the Severn. There was however an independent Church here in King John's reign, for he presented a Rector thereto. On Nov. 27, 1288, Bishop Swinfield, visiting his Diocese for the second time, crossed the River Severn at the ford of Schrewardyn and preached in Schrewardyn Church. He returned to Alberbury the same day. His Visitation of 1290 did not take him so far north as Shrawardine. The Taxation of 1291 places the Church of Shrewardyn in the Diocese of Hereford, the Archdeaconry of Salop, and the Deanery of Pontesbury. Its value was \u00a35 per annum.2 As to the tithes having been granted to Shrewsbury Abbey, the gift is indeed in serted pro forma in several Royal Confirmations, but it had no actual permanence. Probably it was never recognized by the Fitz Alans, and it seems to have altogether wanted Episcopal sanction. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth rated the Parish of Shrawar thin at \u00a32 ; \u2014 so much less than the Church-Taxation of \u00a35, be cause the Earl of Arundel had enclosed 3 carucates in his Park, and because 3 carucates more lay waste, from the insufficient means of the tenantry. Moreover a vast quantity of growing wheat had been destroyed by a flood ofthe Severn. Lastly the Church-Taxa tion included Glebe-land, hay-tithes, oblata, and other small tithes, which had no reference to the present assessment.3 An inquest of the year 1386 found Shrawardine Chapel to he free and without any cure of souls, and that this was by ancient custom. The Cure of the said Chapelry belonged to the Vicar of Alberbury. The Benefice was worth \u00a35 per annum.

The gift will have been but impletive of Earl Roger's donation of the Church of Baschurch, which I presume comprehended Little Ness within its Parish. As Little Ness was always held by the Fitz Alans in demesne, I have fewer particulars to give about tbe central Manor than about its members. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" John fitz Alan holds, in John fitz Alan's Nesse,2 three non-geldable hides ; and he holds the same in capite of the King as parcel of his Manor of Oswestry ; and he affirms himself to have a Franchise and Warren (libertatem et warennam).\"3 On the death of John fitz Alan (III) Little Ness was annexed to the dower of Isabel de Mortimer, his widow. Hence the Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 says that \" Isabella de Mortuomari holds Nesse of the King in capite, and it pertains to the Barony of Album Monasterium.\" Later documents give no variation from these accounts, so that the further history of Little Ness would be but a repetition of what has been already stated at large in the account of Fitz Alan's Barony. Of the members of Little Ness we have some interesting particulars.\u2014 Milford. Here was probably that very Mill which Domesday tinguish it bom Ness Strange. 3 Rot. Hundred. II. 76.

I have already told how John fitz Alan (II) bequeathed this Mill with his body in burial, to Haughmond Abbey, and how John fitz Alan (III) ratified his father's bequest.1 Nevertheless, on the death of the latter in March 1272, his widow, Isabel de Mortimer, impleaded the Abbot for her thirds in the Mill, and in 7s. rent, receivable from Mulford. The Abbot called Roger de Mortimer (Isabel's father), to warrant the Charter of John fitz Alan, deceased. This was because the said Roger was in part Custos of Fitz Alan's estates, but he refused to plead, or to give any warranty, unless the King joined him (he having his trust from the King). Muleford Mill was at length (on May 3, 1274) valued by Inquest. It was ascertained to yield a clear annual revenue of 20 measures of hard corn, worth, at 4s. per mea sure, j64. The person who farmed the Mill was bound to repair it. A King's Writ of June 22, 1274, orders the Escheator to cause Isabel de Mortimer to have her exact thirds, viz. 2 merks from the Mill, and 2s. 4c?. of the aforesaid rent. Bentmill. I think that this Mill was in Little Ness, and was distinct from Milford Mill, though the two often occur in conjunc tion and were perhaps eventually amalgamated. I will give, in an abbreviated form, the important but lengthy Charter by which, between the years 1268 and 1271, the third John fitz Alan sold Bentmill to Haughmond Abbey. \u2014 Seiant presentes et futuri quod ego Johannes filius Alani tercius, dominus Arundelli\u00e6, dedi, fye, Ecclesi\u00e6 de Haghmon, molendinum illud quod dicitur Benetmull, cum aquis, stagnis, ripis, fye, cum moltd et sectd hominum meorum et omnium tenencium meorum in Manerio de Schrewardin, Moneford, et de Nesse, ita quod si aliquis eorum in veniatur alibi molere blada sua quam in molendino predicto, eo ipso perdat blada sua.

Another Charter of the same Baron is more than a repetition of the last, in that it names the tenants who were now to pay the 9s. rent for Muleford. They were Hugh de Schrewardin Junior, Richard fitz Agnes and Adam his brother, and John Smith. This Charter then goes on to confirm certain acquisitions of the Canons in Hydesland, Aston, and Wodeton, of which matter I will speak elsewhere. In addition to the witnesses of the last it is attested by Reyner de Acton and Hugh fitz Philip. Richard, Earl of Arundel, inspected, recited, and confirmed the last-named Charter of his father. He did so \" for the souls' health of himself and his deceased consort the Countess Alesya.\"3 Wit nesses, \u2014 Sir John le Strange, quintus; Nicholas de Alditheleg; William de Hodnet, Thomas de Roshale, knights; Reginald de Schavinton, Yvo de Sulton, Philip de Peninton, Thomas de Wy thinton, and others. This Confirmation passed between 1292 and 1299. In 1300 Richard Knight ot Walford, was farming the two Mills of Mulforde and Bentmille under Haghmon Abbey, and had timber from the Wood of Nesse for their re-construction, in virtue of Earl Richard's Confirmation. On February 2, 1316, the Abbot demises to William, son of Roger de Addecote, the Mill of Mulforde and of Bent, for life, pay ing, for rent, 26 measures of good hard corn, at such times as the Mills should earn them.

The first Thomas de Rosshall gave the vill wholly to Haghmon Abbey. This was between the years 1259 and 1263. His Charter shows it to have been a gift in frank ahnoign, and nothing is stipu lated for the Grantor but the prayers and good offices of the \" House of Haghmon.\" All the Grantor's tenants pass with the vill, as well as their families and chattels, and the Abbot may eject them or change them at his pleasure. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir John fitz Alan, Sir John fitz Philip, Hamo le Botiler, Hugh de Schrewardin, Peter de Pecton, and Roger de Stanwardyn. The above Deed probably passed at a troubled period. It was in the month after the Battle of Evesham, and when the Realm was again at peace, that \" John fitz Alan, Lord of Arundel,\" being at Winchester, expedited a Letter to Fynyan de Roshalle. Constable of Oswestry, and William de Drayton, Bailiff of Wroxeter, aud all others his Bailiffs and Lieges of the March. He as \" Lord of the Fee,\" enjoins that the said Officers give the Abbot of Haghmon ingress in, and peaceable possession of, Addecote, as granted by Sir Thomas de Roshalle. Dated on the feast of St. Matthew (Sep tember 21), Anno Grati\u00e6 1265.1 The Confirmation of Vivian, \" son and heir of Sir Thomas de Roshall, knight,\" is as plenary as the Grant of his Father. It pro bably passed about 1265-70, being attested by Sir Odo de Hodnet and Sir John fitz Aer, knights; Robert Corbet of Morton, John Lord of Ercalwe, John de Haukeston and others. I must now revert to an earlier period, and show how Addcott had beeu held by a younger branch of the House of Rosshall, under the elder ; and how Addcott-Mill had been given to Haghmon Abbey long before the Vill itself was bestowed. There was a Hugh de Russal living in 1203, but all I can say of him is that one Richard de Wyldritheled was then impleading him, under Writ of mort d'ancestre. There was also a Hugh de Roshall, who seems to have made some grant to Haghmon Abbey about the year 1230, but all I can say of the Grant is that it was attested by Sir John le Strange, Senior, and his two sons, John and Hamo, by Thomas de Lee, and by Hugh and Henry, sons ofthe Grantor.2 This Hugh de Rosshall has further been seen, following Thomas de Rosshall (his nephew I think) as a witness of a Hadnall Deed, about 1235-40.3 1 Harl.

About the year 1255, and before he gave the vill of Addcott to Haghmon Abbey, \" Thomas de Rossall allowed the Canons to erect a fulling-mill in his fee, below that Mill in Addecote which they already had from him and his Antecessors.

Some rent also coming from Addestete (Qy. Addcott ?) is classed with rents from Walleford, Fitz, and Grafton.1 On Sept. 30, 1478, the Abbey leases 4 messuages and 2 virgates in the vill and fields of Addecote, to Richard Brome, for 81 years. Rent \u00a31. 4s. 8c?. On Oct. 10, 1478, the Abbey leases to the same for 80 years, its Mill of Addecote.

The Valor of Henry VIII. probably includes all the Haughmond receipts from this quarter under the title Muryden, of which place we have yet to speak.

The latter was doubt less the person who, as \u2014 Reyner de Frankton, attests, about the year 1204, a Charter which I shall set forth under Crickets. Again, about the year 1220 we have Reiner de Frankton attesting a grant in Grinsill, made to Robert, son of Richard de Frankton ; and about 1230 we have seen the same Reyner, or his son, attesting an Edgebold Deed.3 Reyner de Frankton (II) will have died within a short time of his father. Agnes, widow of the Father, and Margaret, widow of the Son, have both appeared under Crudington about 1230-1235.4 I suppose that Margaret, the younger widow, had the better part of Frankton, in dower or in custody, during the minority of her son Richard, but that, she having taken a second husband, viz. \u2014 Eynon fitz Owen, the latter was entered in the Feodaries of 1240 as holding half a knight's-fee in Franketon of the Barony of Fitz Alan.5 \u2014 Under Harlescott I have shown this Eynon fitz Owen, with his wife Margery, as living in 1256, and granting a feoffment there, as if Margery was not merely a dowered widow but an heiress.6 How ever, before this, her son \u2014 Richard de Frankton (II) had succeeded to his paternal inhe ritance.

He did suit to County and Hundred, and paid 16c?. yearly for motfee and stretward.1 At the Assizes of 1256 Richard de Frankton sat as a Juror for Pimhill Hundred. In the same year he was reported as one of those who, holding 15 librates of land, were not as yet knights. About 1260-3 we have seen him, as \" Richard, son of Reginald de Frank ton,\" making grants in Crudgington to Shrewsbury Abbey, one of which was confirmed by Margery, his Mother. I find Richard de Frankton sitting on a Milford Inquest in 1274. The Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 registers him as holding Frankton under Fitz Alan by service of half a knight's-fee at Oswestry, for 15 days, in wartime. I can say nothing more of this family as connected with English- Frankton.

Parochially, English Frankton was a member of Ellesmere. aifcrtg&ton, or JHmifes' aifcrifl&ton. The Domesday notice of this Manor is exceptional and supple mentary ; probably because the Commissioners, owing to the recent decease of Warin Vicecomes, could not determine its exact status till it was recognized by his successor Rainald. The following notice was therefore appended at the very foot of Rainald's Domesday Manors, and, though the Record distinguishes Albrighton as in Baschurch Hundred, it separates it from Rainald's eleven Manors, already no ticed, by a wide interval. \u2014 \" Alcher tenuit de Warino, qui suit Antecessor Rainaldi, Etbri tone.

Aherius dedit Etburtonam cum suis appen diciis, are the few words which satisfy all curiosity as to the Giver and the Gift, and add one item more to the incomparable merits of Domesday as a Digest. The Confirmations of Henry I., Henry IL, Stephen, and Henry III. duly record Alcheris or Aher's grant. Nothing therefore remains but to speak of Monks- Albrighton in the condition which gave it that distinctive name. \u2014 In 1167 Alan de Nevill, Justice of the Forest, set a Fiue of 6s. 8c?. on the ville of Etburton. Bishop Peche (1161-1182), in his Confirmation to the Monks of Shrewsbury, allows them the tithes of Adbrichtone as tithes of their own proper demesnes.1 The grant was iu conformity with an im memorial privilege of Shrewsbury Abbey, but nevertheless a dimi nution of the Revenues of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury, the Parish Church of Albrighton.

The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1279 says, with more than usual inaccuracy, that \" the Abbot of Salop holds Adbrighton of the King in capite, in pure and perpetual almoign, by feoffment of Earl Roger de Bedlem.\" An Inquest, taken on December 19, 1296, before Roger le Strange, Justice of the Forests-citra-Trent, by Roger fitz John, Seneschal of the Shropshire Forests, and by other Knights, Verderers, Subfor esters, and common Jurors, found that it would not be injurious to the King if he aRowed the Abbot of Shrewsbury to assart, and to enclose with a low fence, 30 acres at Aston, in the Abbot's own bosc, and within the forest ofthe Wrekin, \u2014 10 acres in Little Betton, within the forest of Lythwood, and a number of acres (uncertain how many) in Adbrighton and Shetereshawe, within the Forest of Hawemon.

There is some doubt whether this vill was a member of Albrighton, but the balance of evidence favours such a supposition rather than any other. The Abbot of Shrewsbury indeed never appears seized in demesne of Wollascott ; but some of the Abbot's feoffments were so very early and absolute that the Feoffees, when they at length appear, are found in all but complete independence. I suppose that the family of Le Poer were originally the Abbot's tenants here, holding the estate by rent of Is. and by suit at the Manor-Court of Albrighton. Roger Puher we have seen attesting a Charter of the first Wil liam fitz Alan about 1155-8.1 Robert le Poer attests a Charter of Vivian de Rossall about 1190-5,2 and about the same time is followed by Henry, his son, in the attestation of a Hadnall Deed. AlaiV le Poer occurs in 1235. On June 11 of that year, as \"Alan le Poer of Wilauscot,\" he obtained the Abbot of Shrews bury's permission to make a ditch, enclosing a parcel of meadow near his (Alan's) Mill. He also obtained a small piece of land called Parihulle-Grene, near the Abbot's arable land. \" In return, Alan concedes to the Abbot 11 seilions of assarts, which the Abbot's men of Eadbrichton had then assarted.

A rent of 12c?., payable at Michaelmas to Haghmon Abbey, was charged on the Grantee. The said Grantee, calling himself \" John, son of Alan le Poer of Wylavescote,\" enfeoffed Godefrid, Vicar of St. Alkmunds, in the said barn, \" which William Le Strange, father of John's mother, Amicia, gave in frank marriage with the said Amicia to Alan, John's father.\" Here a rent of 3s. is reserved to Supra, page 45.. 2 Supra, Vol. IX. p. 323. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 401."], [557, "111 RUYTON JUXTA BASCHURCH. the Feoffor and his heirs, and the Haghmon rent is also charged on the Feoffee.1 The eldest son and heir of Alan le Poer was called \u2014 William de Wollascott. In 1259, William, son of Alan de Wollavescote, is entered on the Pipe-Roll as owing half a merk for a Writ of Pone. In 1262 as William de Wulascote he sat on a Leaton Inquest. He sat as a Juror for Pimhill Hundred at the Assizes of 1272, and the Inquest of 1274. At the said Assizes \"William, son of Alan de Wolawescote,\" acknowledged that he had given his share of Shortwode to Sir Walter de Hopton. Futes (i. e. Fitz) and Jagedon are named as localities adjacent to Shortwood. Sir Walter de Hopton was one of the four Justices who presided at these Assizes, and was Lord of Fitz. I suppose we may safely date as in 1272 a transaction, recorded in the Salop Chartulary, whereby William de Wollascott consented to receive Sir Vivian de Rosshall as Mesne-Lord between himself and the Abbey. \u2014 \"William de Wilascot and the Abbot had had disputes about 12d. rent and suit of court at Adbricton.

The early history of Ruyton is very anomalous. It is the only Manor of Baschurch Hundred (proper), which was detached from the later Hundred of Pimhill and annexed to Oswestry Hundred. Its situation on the Western bank of the Perry will not account for this, for that River was by no means adopted as the boundary be tween Oswestry and Pimhill Hundreds. Probably the influence of Fitz Alan, or his Ancestor, Alan fitz Flaald, was sufficient both to obtain the Manor, and to annex it to their own Hundred of Oswes try. Ecclesiastical boundaries were not so elastic ; for, as we have seen, in the twelfth century, Ruyton was still a Chapelry in the Parish of Baschurch.3 Ruyton, thus appropriated to Fitz Alan's exclusive jurisdiction in the Marches, becomes almost lost to English Records. Feod aries, Tenure-Rolls, Sheriffs' Rolls, and Assize-Rolls are alike si lent as to the affairs of a district, where even a King's Writ was inoperative, unless addressed to the local authority, and where the King's Officers might set neither hand nor foot in any matter of civR jurisdiction. to Edmund, Earl of Arundel, who in Ed ward II.'s time purchased and reconso lidated the Manor, with the design of founding a Borough here. As to the eleven towns, which may at some time be supposed to have constituted this Manor, we must presume that some of them are (hke the Domesday Udeford) lost. The existing townships of Ruyton are Cotton, Eardeston, Shelvock, Shotatton, and Wy- key; but it is not probable that more' than two out of the five were members of the original Manor. 1 The Piscari\u00e6 were doubtless in the River Perry. If I understand the Record rightly, these Piscari\u00e6 were not valued separately, because they were underlet to the Villeins of the Manor. 2 Domesday, fo. 257, b, 2. 3 Supra, pp. 69, 70."], [559, "113 RUYTON JUXTA BASCHURCH. It appears that Ruyton was part of the Fief held by the first John le Strange under the first William fitz Alan. Before the year 1172, as we learn from Pope Alexander's Bull, John le Strange had given the Mill of Ruyton to Haghmon Abbey. A Charter of John le Strange (II) treats this gift as if he had originated it. This Charter passed between 1203 and 1210. The Clause which relates to Ruyton-Mill shows distinctly that the Grantor was Lord of the whole Manor. \u2014 Johannes filius Johannis Extranei dedi, fye, in perpetuam elemo synam molendinum de Rutona cum moltd et sectd totius manerii mei de Rutona et cum liberd licentia fodiendi turbas et terram ex omni parte dicti molendini, quoties necesse fuerit, ad ipsum molendinum vel ad stagnum ejusdem, und cum meremio habendo in boscis meis per visum forestariorum meorum ad ipsum molendinum reedifican dum et emendandum semper quoeienscunque necesse fuerit.

About the year 1195 he came to the following agreement with Hugh, Abbot of Shrewsbury. The Abbot conceded to Le Strange a corner of his wood of Birch,1 extending from the place where Le Strange's Park-fence came down to the water of Peveree (Perry), to the end of Le Strange's meadow on the side of Plettebrug Mill.3 This was to enlarge Le Strange's Park, and he was to pay a rent of one doe yearly in acknowledgment.

However, it must have been within the next ten years that John le Strange (V) sold Ruyton, with all its homages and fees, to his Suzerain, Edmund, Earl of Arundel. It is curious that Le Strange's Seigneury over the distant Manor of Glazeley should have passed by this sale to the Earl ; but so it did pass, for Glazeley was held to be an appurtenance of Ruyton.

They had not as yet obtained an Appropriation of the Church. On August 25, 1311, King Edward II. allowed by Charter that Edmund, Earl of Arundel, might hold a weekly Market on Wed nesday, at Ruyton, in the Marches of Wales, and also an 'annual Fair of five days' duration, viz. on the vigil, the day of, and the three days after, the Nativity of John the Baptist (June 23-27). 3 On January 8, 1318, an Inquest was ordered on the death of Guy de Glazeley, supposing that he had held Glazeley under the heir of John le Strange (VI), which heir was iu ward to the Crown. The Jurors, however, responded that Guy de Glazeley had held Glazeley of the Manor of Ruytone, which Manor Edmund, Earl of Arundel, had purchased, with all its homages, fees, etc., of Sir John le Strange of Knokyn ; and so that Guy had held Glazeley under the said Earl Edmund. Leaving Ruyton in the demesne of the Earls of Arundel, I have to say a few more words as to the \u2014 Haughmond Abbey Fee. We have heard of two Mills in Ruy- ton Manor, the Platt Mill (given to Shrewsbury Abbey) and Ruyton Mill (given to Haughmond) . A third Mill, called the Heath Mill, was also given to Haughmond by John le Strange (IV), and so between the years 1269 and 1276. As Johannes extraneus quartus, he gives and confirms, for the souls of himself and his wife Johanna, his Mill of Heath (molendinum de Bruerio) with its fishery and ap- purtenances, and with timber to repair the same out of his wood of Radenhall (Rednall), and with a place near the Mill, convenient for winnowing. One moiety of the profits of this Mill was to go to the Canons themselves ; with the other moiety they were to provide two candles, to burn at the head and foot of the tomb of the aforesaid Johanna, the Grantor's wife. The Grantor further concedes to the Canons the stank of the higher vivary, to be raised and repaired for their use and advantage, with earth taken on either side thereof. Lastly, he undertakes that neither he nor his heirs shall raise the stank of the Vivary near the king's high-road towards Oswestry, 1 Supra, Vol. VIL p. 281. ** Rot. Chart. 5 Edw.

On Dec. 8, 1329, Mortimer, now Earl of March, being at Clun, ordered William de la Hulle, his Seneschal, to inquire concerning the Abbot of Haghmon's alleged right to the Vivary, called Hethpol, in the Manor of Ruton juxta Aston. In pursuance of this order, William de la Hull held an Inquest in the Manorial Court of Ruton on January 30, 1329 (it should be January 29, 1330). The Jury found that the said Vivary belonged to the Abbot ; that Earl Edmund had sometime, by his own will, taken it into his own hand and set it to farm to John, Rector of Ruyton, for life ; that afterwards the Lessee, perceiving the in justice of this, surrendered the Vivary to the Earl, and the Earl, about tivo years (per duos annos) before his death, restored it to the Abbot. On this verdict being given, the Seneschal, on behalf of the Earl of March, surrendered the Vivary to the Abbey.3 On May 7, 1335, Roger Boghan of Ruyton gave to the Abbey a meadow in Ruyton, between the River of Peverey and Allendeswode. On July 3, 1335, the Abbot demised the lower fishery of Heth mulle, to Thomas de Cheyne, Rector of Felton, for life, at a rent of 5s.3 In 12 Edward III. (1338-9), John de Borton, Seneschal of Ruyton, issues a Writ relative to trespasses at Overheth-rnille pole.2 In 1380-1, the Abbot of Haghmon demised Ruyton Mill to John Ythell aud Roger his son. \u2014 Rent, 18 quarters of hard corn.

We have already seen that, in Bishop Durdent's time, Ruyton was a Chapelry, and as a mere affiliation of Baschurch, was of the Advowson of the Abbot of Shrewsbury.3 However the time was yet to come when a Cure of Souls in the Marches was lucrative enough for Monks to be jealous about it. So Ruyton Chapel grew into an independent Rectory under the fostering care of the Lords of the Fee. Again, in 1272, the fourth John le Strange consigned the Church to Monastic Patronage, and the result was, as usual, appropriation. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Ruyton (in the Archdeaconry and Deauery of Salop) at \u00a38 per annum.3 Forty years later, and we find the Abbot of Haughmond moving on the spoil. \u2014 On June 30, 1330, Pope John XXII., being at Avignon, had received a petition from the said Abbot, stating the value of this Rectory to be no more than 12 merks (\u00a38), and asking for leave to appropriate it. The Pope consents, gives the Abbot corporal pos session as soon as the existing Rector should depart, sets any assent or license of the Bishop of Lichfield at nought, as altogether un necessary, but desires that the future Vicar may have a congruous portion, so as to enable him to sustain Episcopal charges, &c. Roger Northburgh, then Bishop of Lichfield, had been so ap pointed by Pope John himself. On February 27, 1331, we find him reciting his Patron's Bull, including that clause in it which expressed his own nonentity ; but confirming it, and only reserving to himself a right of ordaining the future Vicarage. On January 4, 1332, the same Bishop admitted the first Vicar of Ruyton at the presentation of Haughmond Abbey. On April 16, 1332, Richard, Earl of Arundel, being at Oswestry Castle (a notre Chaslel de Blankemoster) , and no doubt deploring the destitute state of the said Vicar, began to endow the Vicarage anew.

On January 5, 1333, as we have already seen, Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon, appropriated the spoils of the Rectory of Ruyton to the improvement of the Kitchen of his Convent.1 On March 2, 1334, at Shrewsbury, Nicholas, Abbot of Hagh mon, settled a dispute with Master Richard Longnorle, Rector of Straunge-Nesse, as to a third part of the tithes and oblations, of all sorts, arising from the new vill of Acton, near Ruyton.3 It was agreed that, whereas the Church of Ruyton had been used to receive a moiety of such dues, the Abbot, as Impropriator, should now re ceive the third which he sought, under a penalty of 40s. on the Rector of Ness. On April 1, 1334, Bishop Northburgh sanctions this agreement. On January 29, 1336, the Ordination of Ruyton Vicarage, as it was called, issued from the Chapter-House of Haghmon, authen ticated only by the fiat of the Abbot and Convent. In 1341 Ruyton was not assessed as a distinct Parish to the cur rent tax of the Ninth. This was doubtless because it was in Oswestry Hundred. On October 21, 1462, a dispute between Sir John Gredington, late Vicar of Ruyton, and Abbot Richard of Haghmon (of the one part), and William Bickley, Perpetual Vicar of Straunge Nesse (of the other part), about a third of the tithes and oblations of the new vill of Atton-prope-Ruyion, was settled as before, except that the Vicar of Ness was to have the whole oblations of the men and women of Atton, offering on three solemn and accustomed days in the Church of Nesse. This was decided by the Commissory of John (Hales) Bishop of Lichfield, sitting in the Church of Wem.

I have no alternative but to treat this Manor as originally an outlyiug member of Ruyton. My reasons for doing so, hardly sufficient in themselves, are fortified by the difficulty of assigning any other origin for the Manor of Stanwardine. We have seen that the Udeford of Domesday was coupled by te- nure with Ruyton, though in Saxon times the Manors had been distinct. However, Leuenot, the Saxon Lord of Udeford and Ruy- ton, had also been Lord of Petton. Now Petton and Stanwardine- in-the-Wood were contiguous. Again there is an analogy between the names Udeford (i.e. Woodford) and Stanwardine-in-the-Wood. After Domesday , Stanwardine-in-the-Wood and Ruyton had nothing to connect them, except that both were of the Seigneury of Fitz Alan. Fitz Alan gave Ruyton to Le Strange, and it was annexed to Oswestry Hundred. Fitz Alan's contemporary Feoffee at Stanwardine was Richard de Stanwardine, and Stanwardine remained in Pimhill Hundred, which would correspond with its Domesday status, if it was identical with Udeford. However the later Lords of Stan- wardine (about 1230) withdrew its suit from the County of Salop and Hundred of Pimhill. Was not this in consequence of some tra ditional idea that, having been once a member of Ruyton, it ought to follow Ruyton into Walcheria ?

This Richard was a wealthy man ; for the Fine of 60 merks and two destriers, set upon him for Forest-trespass in 1177, indicates a liability higher than that of many contemporary Barons. What is more, the whole of the enormous penalty was paid in two years. Between the years 1189 and 1193 Richard de Stanewrd' being impleaded in the Curia ComitaMs, under a Writ of right, for one virgate in Stanewrd, put himself on trial by Grand Assize, viz. \" whether he or the Plaintiffs (Matilda de Cote and her son Robert) had the better right ?\" William de Stanwardine, son and heir, I think, of Richard, occurs in the year 1193, when he was security in the sum of 6s. 8c?. for the replevin of Engelard Bozard.1 William de Stanwardine (II), son of the above William, mar ried Emma, daughter of Eynon de Hordley, and occurs in 1221 and 1225. He was deceased in June 1231, leaving his wife Emma surviving. Of him and her I shall have more to say under Hordley and under Bagley. It was this William, apparently, who withdrew Stanwardine from the suit of Pimhill Hundred. Hugh de Stanwardine, son and heir of William, son of William, occurs in 1236 and about 1240, as we shall see under Bagley. It is further related of him that he conceded half the Mill of Wycheele (Wycherley) to William de Stanwardine, that is, I conceive, to his younger brother and eventual heir. Hugh was deceased without issue before July 1241, when the following Fine shows his brother \u2014 William de Stanwardine (III) to be Lord of Stanwardine. On July 15, 1241, a Fine was levied at Gloucester, whereby Wil liam fitz William conceded to Agnes, widow of William fitz Ralph, 4s. annual rent in Stanewrdin, arising from a tenement held by Maddoks and Richard Mercator. This was in lieu of dowry claimed by the Lady, viz. a third of 2 virgates of land and Ils. rent in Stanwrthin. In 1243 William, son of William de Stanworth, fines half a merk for some Inquest to be had. In 1255 the Jurors of Pimhill Hundred said that William, Lord of Stanwardyne-in-bosco, had withdrawn suit from County and Hundred for 24 years, whereby the King had damage of 48s., or at the rate of 2s. per annum.2 The Jurors of 1274 alleged this withdrawal against William de Stan wardine (III), dating it, as they did, from about 1254. William de Stanwardine (III) was deceased before 1256. In March 1259, his widow, Alina, demised certain land iu Eyton to 1 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 180. 2 Rot. Hundred.

Roger de Stanwardine, son and heir of the last William, was apparently of age in January 1256, for he was then amerced for non-attendance at an Inquest. On April 20, 1263, he was sued by Richard de Petton for disseizing the said Richard of a tenement in Staneworthin. Again in 1266 and 1267 we have this suit, con cerning a messuage and 2 virgates in Petton, renewed by Peter, as son and heir of Richard de Petton. In 1272 it came on for trial at the Assizes, Peter de Petton alleging the disseizin, as practised on Richard his Father. A Fine was the result. Thereby Peter re nounced his claim to a messuage and 2 virgates in Stanworthyn. Roger, in return, conceded to Peter that moiety of the Mill of Wycheele which William, his (Roger's) father, had by concession of Hugh de Stanworthyn, also the Vivary thereof, and a right of common in his (Roger's) woods. Peter again conceded to Roger a right of common in those boses at Petton which were called Roswode and Heyshete ; \u2014 both parties reserving a right to make assart of their respective woods. At the Inquests of November 1274, the Pimhill Jurors spoke of Roger de Stanwardin as having been re cently in office as Constable of Shrewsbury Castle. They alleged an act of corruption against his Deputy, Reyner le Mons, who had released a prisoner for a bribe. The Pimhill Tenure- Roll of 1279 has the following extraordinary entry. \u2014 \" Stamvardyne tenetur de Johanne filio Alani per servicium, in bosco ,*\" \u2014 where it is evident that the two parts of the name are separated by the rest of the sentence, and that the sentence is still incomplete, as well as inaccurate, for John fitz Alan had been dead some years. A somewhat later Feodary gives Stanewardyn-in-bosco, with Montford, Hedenesdon (Ensdon), Forton, Ness (Little Ness), Little Milford, and Shrawardine as held by Isabel de Mortimer. This means that Isabel, widow of John fitz Alan, had the Seigneury of all these estates in dower. By a Fine levied on July 1, 1307, \u2014 Philip de Stanwarthyn sold to Richard Hord and his wife, Eva, one measure, two carucates of land, and 18s. rent, in Stan warthyn and Wycherlegh ;\u2014 to hold to them, and the heirs of Richard, under the Lords of the Fee. \u00a3100 was the price which tempted this last of the Stanwardines to alienate an estate which we have traced in his family for more than a century. x. 16"], [570, "122 HORDELEY.

At the Assizes in question, Agnes and Emma, with their two husbands, brought an action for disseizin against Wenthlian, the mother of Kenwric, but the De fendant got a verdict on the ground that there had been no dis seizin ; for, while her son had always remained at Hordeley, the Plaintiffs had gone and come of their own accord.1 In Michaelmas Term 1233, the Abbot of Shrewsbury and Kene wric de Hordelegh had a suit of dernier presentment at Westminster about the Church of Hordelegh.

They rate the Parish at 20s. only, because the Church-Taxation was made up in part of Glebe, oblations, and small-tithes ; and because there were no sheep in the Parish.3 The Valor of 1535 improperly places Hordeley in the Deanery of Newport. The annual Income of William Powys, Rector thereof, was \u00a34. 2s. ; less 2s. for procurations, and lie?, for Synodals.3 The Abbot of Shrewsbury's pension seems to have become obsolete.

Instead of beginning each of the three clauses with the words Isdem Rogerius tenet, it begins with the words Rogerius tenet de Comite. It is evident that the Compiler of the Record was not quite sure whether the Roger, who held Maneford, &c, was Roger fitz Corbet or not : and his doubt must remain ours, for beyond the fact that the Corbets retained nothing in either of the three Manors in ques tion, we have little to guide us. That little however is that, from the subsequent history of Montford, we should rather infer Roger de Lacy to have been its Domesday possessor. The Record suggests still further topics of remark, and runs as follows. \u2014 \" Rogerius tenet de Comite Maneford. Elmer tenuit. Ibi in hid\u00e6.

As to the half-fishery which Domesday allots to Montford it will have been part of a Weir in the Severn; no doubt the same Weir as that, of which the other half belonged to the opposite Manor of Ford.3 The event of the suit between the Bishop of Hereford and Roger, Domesday Lord of Montford, can only be surmised. Within six years after Domesday, Roger de Lacy was Lord of Montford, or as sumed himself so to be. And here we are left in a dilemma, for we cannot tell whether the Bishop had recovered Montford from the Domesday Roger, and had enfeoffed Roger de Lacy (who was his tenant elsewhere in Shropshire) therein ; or whether Roger de Lacy was the Domesday Roger himself, and had held continuous posses sion of Montford. Be this as it may, Roger de Lacy gave Manaford to Shrewsbury Abbey, and the grant must have been before 1091, for in that year Roger de Lacy suffered absolute and utter forfeiture. It is next to be noted that, though the Confirmations of Earl \u00bb Domesday, fo. 255, b, 2. * Vide supra, Vol. VII. p. 180."], [574, "126 MONTFORD. Roger and William II. are silent about this gift of Roger de Lacy to Shrewsbury Abbey, yet the Confirmation of Henry I. records it; \u2014 records it too as a grant which Earl Roger had confirmed. But again, the Confirmations of Stephen, Henry IL, and Henry III. are silent on the grant, and it is certain that it took no ulti mate effect. On the restoration of the House of Lacy, in the reign of King Henry II. , Montford was again attached to their Fief; and it was one of the estates which Hugh de Lacy gave iu frank-mar riage with his daughter to the second William fitz Alan. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 puts Moneford down as a Manor of 1^ hides (half its Domesday contents). John fitz Alan held it in frank-marriage. It was not geldable. It was of tlie fee of Matildis de Lacy (eldest daughter and coheir of Walter, last Baron Lacy) . Fitz Alan did suit to the County, both for this land and for his other lands in Shropshire, and had a Franchise and Warren.1 The Inquest, taken in 1272 on the death of the third John fitz Alan, included his estates at Nesse (Little Ness), Maneford, and Forton. Montford was annexed to the dower of his widow. Hence the Tenure- Roll of 1279 says that \"Isabella de Mortimer holds Montforde, and it is of the fee of John fitz Alan, and she owes suit to County and Hundred for that estate.\" Mountford-Bridge (famous for many a parley between the Am bassadors of England and North Wales) was reported to be broken down, at the Assizes of 1292. All men, said the Pimhill Jurors, used to cross it with horses and carriages. John de Hegerwas, now deceased, had received the tolls (passagium) on condition of keeping it in repair and by a Royal grant. He had caused to be carried to his own house dressed stoue and timber, which had been purchased for the repair of the bridge. The Judges ordered his Executors to be summoned, and commissioned the Abbot of Haghmon and Roger Sprenghose to audit their accounts. It proved that the receipts from tolls had been only \u00a319. 8s. Ic?. ; while the expenditure had been \u00a336. Is. 2c?. The Auditors reported therefore that \" the ex penses exceeded the receipts by \u00a315. 13s. ;\" \u2014 a calculation which does not prove much for their qualifications as Auditors.

In whatever Saxon Parish Montford lay, at and before Domesday, it had an independent Church in the 13th century, and the Ad vowson thereof had passed to the White Nuns of Brewood, but whether by grant of a Lacy or a Fitz Alan I cannot learn. The Taxation of 1291, placing Moneford in the Deanery and Archdeaconry of Salop, values the Church at \u00a35. 6s. 8c?. per an num.1 Whether now, or within the next 40 years, the Brewood Nuns had an appropriation of the Rectory. In 1341, the Assessors of the Ninth, quoting the Church-Taxation of 8 merks, rated the Parish of Moneford at \u00a34. The reasons for the diminution were because 6 carucates of land within the Parish lay waste, both in the Earl of Arundel's part and elsewhere ;2 be cause there had been murrain among the sheep, and a Severn flood had destroyed most of the growing corn. Moreover the Church-Taxation included Glebe-land and Altarages, things which were irrelevant in calculating a Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb.3 The Valor of 1535 gives the income* of John Browne, Vicar of Monsforde, as \u00a35. 6s. 8c?., less 6s. 8d. for procurations and Is. 6c?. for synodals.4 The Rectory of Montford (printed Nantford) was at the same time productive of an annual Ferm of \u00a38 to the White Nuns of Brewood ; but we now first hear of a pension of 10s., which the Nuns paid out of the said Rectory to the Prior of St. Guthlac at Hereford.5 The inference is, that whenever the Nuns first ac quired this Advowson, they found it charged by a Lacy with this pension. So far Montford Church was on a footing with other Churches of Lacy's Shropshire Fief; but it is further probable that the Churches thus charged were very ancient Foundations ; \u2014 nearly as old as Domesday.6 EARLY VICARS.

From this association of the smaller part of Preston with Montford, the whole' of Preston got the name of Preston Montford. The connection between Preston and Montford lasts no later than Domesday, except in name. The smaller part of Preston, that which was in Bascherch Hundred, became involved with the larger part, in Ford Hundred : \u2014 going with it to Lilleshall Abbey, and into the Liberties of Shrewsbury.

We are invited to believe that Cynddylan, Prince of Powis, re tiring in the sixth century before the superior power of the Saxons, and having already abandoned his ancient dominion of Pengwern, stood at bay among the morasses of this district, and, being slain in battle, was buried at Baschurch. The Elegy on Cynddylan is a poem attributed to Llywarch Hen, the alleged brother-in-law of Cynddylan. It contains the following passage, pertinent to the question of Cynddylan's burial-place. \u2014 \" Eglwysau Bassa yut wng heno, Metivedd Cyndrwyn : I ablan Cynddylan wyn !\" (The Churches of Bassa afford a space this night To the offspring of Cyndrwyn ; \u2014 The grave-house of fair Cynddylan !) The theory which connects the Berth with the history and fate of Cynddylan, I am not prepared to investigate, but the introduction of Baschurch into the above story is not, I hope, essential to its credibility. \u2014 Basse is a Saxon proper name.1 Baschurch cannot therefore have been founded till long after the \u00e6ra of Cynddylan ; \u2014 for Chris tianity and Churches were unknown in Mercia till the middle of the seventh century. I am afraid that the obvious result of the above argument goes to question either the antiquity of the \u00e6ra of, or the authenticity of the poem assigned to, Llywarch Hen. The poem must be the work of a Bard, who might have known that Cynddylan was buried near the place which in his (the Bard's) time was called Baschurch ; but who did not know that the Church of Bassa was non-existent at the \u00e6ra of Cynddylan. In speaking of Middle I have shown that, previous to Domesday , Earl Roger gave the Church of Baschurch, with its three estates of Prestcote, Nunneley, and Bagley, to Shrewsbury Abbey. This information was derived from two Monastic Charters. Domesday not only registers the gift, but substantiates the most curious part of it, viz. that the Church of Baschurch was thus richly endowed. Ipse Comes tenet Bascherche. Rex Edwardus tenuit.

The third penny belonged of course to the Earl of Mercia. The Royal revenue from these two sources was \u00a37 per anmyn. \u2014 In 1086 the hide, still held by Earl Roger in demesne, and the whole profits of the Hundred, produced \u00a36. \u2014 \u25a0 The remaining 2\\ hides were, and probably always had been, Church-land. They may be taken as the contents of Prestcote, Nunneley, and Bagley, as distinct from Baschurch proper. The Monks of Shrewsbury had stocked this land with a full complement of team-power. \u2014 The hide retained by Earl Roger in demesne, and being iu fact the Capital Manor, was in the next generation the subject of a very singular episode. It constituted the sole eleemosynary offering which the Annals of Shropshire can record for the memory of Earl Robert de Belesme. He gave it to Shrewsbury Abbey. The gift must have taken place in the year 1101, if the following extract from Henry I.'s Confirmation of 1121 may be taken as verbally and substantively correct. \u2014 \"Robertus de Belismo, qui post Hugonem fratrem suum Comitatus suscepit honorem, dedit Ecclesi\u00e6 Sancti Petri, et Monachis ejusdem loci, Bascerce, cum omnibus qu\u00e6 ad earn villam pertinebant, conce dente et sigilli sui auctoritate firmante piissimo Rege Henrico.\" It is observable that much sooner after the fall of Belesme, that is between the years 1102 and 1108, King Henry I. had given Baschurch to the Abbey in a form which would suggest that the King himself originated the gift. This reticence about the one good act of a defeated but still dreaded foe, was natural enough in the King at that period. It tells us something of motives and feel ings; and perhaps something of that feudal spirit which looked upon attaint as equivalent to annihilation.

Apud Lecanot.3 \u00bb Baschurch, both Church-fee and Manor, thus became solely the property ofthe Abbey, and the Charters of Stephen and Henry II. recognize the title of the Monks, attributing to the Earls, Roger and Robert, their respective shares in the grant. It does not appear that the Lordship of Baschurch Hundred was so united to the Manor, as that the Abbots of Shrewsbury ever obtained any wide jurisdiction under the above grants. It was not the policy of Henry I. to alienate such rights of the Earldom. In his making Pimhill the caput of the new Hundred, I fancy I see a design to abolish all local pretensions whatever. The Pimhill Hun dred-Roll of 1255, in what it says of Baschurch, seems to have had in view only the Church-fee, and to have been drawn up in ignorance of the hide given by Earl Robert. At least, the following entries describe the Church-fee fully, and nothing more. \" The Abbot of Salop holds in capite two non-geldable hides in Baschirche, by feoffment of Earl Roger, in free alms, and he affirms himself to have a franchise.\" And again, \u2014 \" The same Abbot holds half a hide in Baggeley of the King in capite, by feoffment of Earl Roger in free alms ; and he affirms himself to have a franchise.\" On May 13, 1256, King Henry III. granted to the Abbot the privilege of holding a weekly Market on Tuesdays in his Manor of Baschirch, and a yearly Fair of four days, viz. on the vigil, the day of, and the two days following the feast of All Saints (Oct. 31- Nov. 3).3 The same King's Charter of Free Warren, dated on May 21, 1256, extends to the Abbot's demesnes at Bascherche.5 The Valor of 1291, by some extraordinary chance, omits any statement as to the Abbot of Shrewsbury's temporalities at Bas- 1 Robert de Limesi. in 1108.

His exercise of Free Warren there was noticed, but passed unquestioned, at the Assizes of 1292. From a Charter of Decem ber 28, 1339, Baschurch would appear to have been increasing in population and importance since the Conquest of Wales and the tranquillization of the Marches. Now too the inhabitants of the place desired a corporate government and an independent position. It would seem too that the Abbot of Shrewsbury's prescriptive pri vileges were so great as that he was able to second such plans. \u2014 \"With the unanimous consent of his Convent, Adam, Abbot of Salop, gives and concedes to his Tenants and Burgesses of the New Vill1 of Baschirche (natives excepted) that they may hold their Burgages, recently built, or thereafter to be built, for 100 years, each such Burgage paying to the Abbey an annual rent of 2s. in lieu of all services, except suit of the Manor-Court, and a heriot of 2s. at the decease of any Burgess. The Abbot further imparts to his Bur gesses his own franchise of selling free of toll throughout England. He gives them rights of common throughout the Manor, and liberty to assize bread and beer, and to elect their own Bailiff.\" Such a Charter as the above will have put the men of Baschurch on a foot ing, equal to, and in some respects superior to, the inhabitants of a Royal Borough. An Abbey Rent-Roll, drawn up about 1490, gives under Prescot, fifteen items of receipt, amounting to \u00a33. 7s. 4c?. ; under Nonyley, three items, amounting to \u00a31. 4s. 4c?. ; under Acton, twelve items, amounting to \u00a34. 14s. ; and under Baglay, three items, amounting to \u00a39. 12s. 9c?. It is also noted that every tenant in Baschurch pays a rent of 2 hens yearly to the Abbey. The return of Abbot Thomas for the Valor of 1534 gives (among the temporalities of his House) assized rents of \u00a325. 17s. 8c?. as arising from Baschurch ; and a rent of 20s. from Dashechurche.2 The Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 record a nearly identical total of \u00a326. 19s. as arising from the following items, receivable from Baschurch, and its members of Newton, Prescott, Acton, Byrche, Nonyley, and Bageley, viz.

We will first take the Church-fee, consisting of three vills, Prescott, Bagley, and Nunne ley. The very name of \u2014 Prestcott (i. e. Priest-cot) shows how anciently this vill had been attached to the Church. Perhaps the following Fine should be introduced here. \u2014 On Sept. 18, 1199, Philip de la Mare, tenant of certain land in Mara (perhaps The Mere), surrenders the same to Alice de Prestecot (Plaintiff), who in turn allows him to hold it in fee, at a rent of one penny, and for 2s. paid down. Whether the following affair is pertinent to Prescott near Bas church, I am far from sure. In November 1221, Hugh fitz Hugh, Tenant of half a virgate in Prestecot, fines half a merk (Osbert Pur cel being his Surety) for license to compound a cause of Grand Assize, wherein Goditha Slavine and her sister Matilda were Plain tiffs. By the Fine, levied accordingly, Hugh fitz Hugh concedes to Godith Sclavin and her sister sixteen acres ofthe premises, to be held under him, together with 12 acres (already held by the same sisters) at a rent of 3c?. The 16 acres thus conveyed are defined as lying in Arildewell, in Chesterfordfeld, and in Hinesmere. At the Assizes of 1256 the Pimhill Jurors presented an appeal as lying in the County Court, wherein John de Prestecote had accused Henry, Abbot of Shrewsbury, John Cruch (a monk), and Elias filz Hugh of Nunniley, of robbing him of a horse, and of 4c?. The Ap pellant did not now appear, and the Abbot and Elyas fitz Hugh were Clerks, and so, I presume, could not be dealt with in the ordinary way; but the Justices declined to enter into the case on another ground. \u2014 The Robbery purported to have taken place in Walcherid. Surely this Plaintiff was not that John de Prestcote who had lands at Prescott, but who migrated to Shrewsbury, who appears as employed in the Abbot's affairs as early as 1255, who became Bail iff of the Abbot's Liberty of the Foregate, about 1260, and who still held that office in October 1272.

It was Bishop Novant who, between the years 1188 and 1194, allowed the Monks of Shrewsbury to appropriate this Rectory. His Charter (which shows that the Church, like other Saxon Founda tions, was in his time Collegiate or Portionary) runs as follows. \u2014 \" Hugo permissione divina Coventri\u00e6 Episcopus, omnibus per Epis copatum Coventri\u00e6 constitutis, salutsm, gratiam, et benedictionem, Noverit universitas vestra, nos, intuitu caritatis qua Abbas et Mo nachi de Salop pr\u00e6eminere noscuntur, commisisse eis Ecclesiam de Bascherche cum omnibus ad earn de jure pertinentibus, in usus hos pitum et peregrinorum et pauperum converlandam, post decessum Willielmi Brun et Herberti filii Alardi, clericorum, qui nunc earn possident.

Among the items were two measures of corn, to be taken out of the Rectorial revenues of Baschurch, and the 5s. rent, with which we have seen John le Strange (II) charge his estate at Newton, near Middle.5 In the Taxation of 1291 the Church of Bascherch (i.e. the Rec tory) is valued at \u00a316 ; \u2014 the Vicarage, at \u00a35, per annum. The Vicar also received a pension of 2s. from the Church of Loppington,6 probably a token of ancient subjection to Baschurch. In 1341 the Assessors quoted the Taxation of the Church of Basest' as one of i\u00a321. They reduced this to an assessment of \u00a312 on the Parish. Their reasons were, because the usual stock of sheep was uot kept up in the Parish, and because all the lambs produced in the current year had been sold for two quarters of oats. More over, the wheat crop had failed in a great measure, and the com munity were pauperized by different taxes of constant occurrence. To the \u00a39 now levied on the Parish, the Temporalities of Shrews bury Abbey contributed a due proportion.7 The Abbey Rental (about 1490) gives \u00a334 as the Rectorial tithes of Baschurch, besides a tithe varying from Is, to Is. 6c?,, according as Byrche was fallow or sown.

The Bishops, unable to secure to these Officers any more regular stipend, seem at one time to have taxed certain impropriate Rectories in their favour. EARLY INCUMBENTS. William Brun (living about 1188-1209) and \u2014 Herbert fitz Alard (living about 1188-1194) seem to have been the last Co-Rectors of Baschurch. The following list of Vicars is meagre enough, and induces a suspicion that the Parish was very laxly provided for. \u2014 William occurs as Vicar about 1260-70. Sir Richard, \" perpetual Vicar of Baschurch,\" accepts, in 1298, a lease of lands, &c, in Eyton, under Sir Richard de Leighton. The Lease was for 12 years yet to come ; but the Lessee seems to have vacated the Vicarage in less than one : for \u2014 John de Morton, Chaplain, was instituted January 11, 1299, at the presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury.

Perhaps too its subsequent Lords were Walcheline's lineal descen- dants. But with Grinshill the case was otherwise. It appears to me to have been wholly annexed to the Fief of Fitz Alan, so para- mount in Bascherch Hundred ; and to have been bestowed by Fitz Alan partly on the Erletons or Orletons, and partly on the Lords of Stanton-Hyneheath. I must treat of these presumed feoffments distinctively. \u2014 Orleton Fee. Adam de Orleton has been seen to have granted half a virgate in Grinshill, before the year 1172, to Hagh mon Abbey.3 The same Adam attests about 1175 two important Charters of the second William fitz Alan, whose Vassal he probably was at Grinshill, and not elsewhere.

Witnesses, \u2014 Vivian de Roshall, Thomas de la Lee, Alan de Burcton, Reiner de Franketon, Reiner de Acton.\"1 There is good reason, but no specific Charter, for assuming that Ralph de Orleton afterwards gave the above reserved rent of 3s. to Wombridge Priory, so that Robert de Frankton became in effect the Prior's tenant. But Haghmon Abbey obtained the Seigneury of this estate by a Convention with Wombridge Priory, of which the particulars are preserved, viz. \" Wombridge quitclaims to Haghmon all right in three half-virgates in Grinselle, which Robert de Franke ton held hereditarily under Wombridge, for a rent of 3s. In return Haghmon quitclaims to Wombridge all right in the Mill of Chese wordin, out of which Wombridge had hitherto paid 3s. annual rent to Haghmon.\"1 This Convention was a very early one of the 13th Century. The Chapters of both Monasteries sanctioned it.3 We have now traced 2 virgates in Grinshill to Haghmon Abbey. What further passed in the following Deed must be surmised. \u2014 \" Pain de Famcchro concedes and gives to the said Abbey, for the souls'-health of himself, his heirs, and ancestors, all his land of Grineleshull, free of all services, for which grant the Abbey gave him 60s. Witnesses, \u2014 Adam, Priest ; Richard fitz Gervase, Priest.\"1 Here we may dismiss the Title of Orleton Fee as applied to anything in Grinshill and speak of the Haghmon Fee. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 says as follows.\u2014 \" The Abbot of Haghmon holds in Grineleshull one geldable hide, and it is of the fee of John fitz Alan, besides (pr\u00e6ter) 1 \\ virgates, which are of the Fee of Erleton ; aud he (the Abbot) pays 3s. per annum to the Prior of Wembrugg, and does suit to the two Tourns of the Sheriff, and pays 3c?. for motfee and stretward.\"3 Here it is doubtful whether the ambiguous word pr\u00e6ter is intended to distinguish the Fitz Alan and Erleton fees, and to make them aggregately 1 hide and 1-g vir gates, or to make the hide inclusive of the 1^ virgates. In either case there is some inaccuracy, for the charge of 3c?. for stretward and motfee is proportionate only to 1 \\ virgates. Moreover it is which the Chartularies of Haughmond and Wombridge fail to supply any parti culars. 3 Rot. Hundred. Vol. II. page 7.6. 1 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit.

On the whole, I judge that Haghmon had acquired 1 hide and 2 virgates in Grins hill, but that only 1| virgates were recognized as liable to stretward and motfee. As the Stanton Fee was half a hide, we shall thus re produce the Domesday estimate. We shall also substantiate docu ments, already quoted under Acton Reynald, which show that the Abbot of Haghmon was Lord of exactly three out of four parts of the Manor of Grinshill. Passing to later times, the Haghmon estate at Grinshill has already had several incidental notices under Acton Reynald. The following may be inserted here. \u2014 On Feb. 22, 1299, \"Abbot Gilbert demises 4 parcels of waste in Grenshill-fields to Alice, widow of William Wigge, of Grenshill, and Richard her son, for the longer life.

On May 3, 1311, one Richard, whose other name is written Hcciriu, exchanges land in Grinshill with the Abbey. On Aug. 24, 1428, John Adam of Haston releases to William Sumpnor, Chap lain, all right in a messuage and half-virgate in Grenshill.

This was half a hide, or one quarter of the Manor. In the 13th century it was held by the Stantons under Fitz Alan, and by the Actons of Acton- Reynald under the Stantons.

This was a mere Dependency ofthe Church of Shawbury, but at the same an ancient foundation. All that I can learn of its early history has been told under Shawbury. dJ% There was yet another tenure in Bascherch Hundred, which ultimately accrued to the Fief of Fitz Alan. It consisted of two Manors, Fitz and Gellidone, held at Domesday by Picot de Say, Baron of Clun. Of Fitz the Record speaks as follows. \u2014 \" Isdem Picot tenet Witesot. Hunnith tenuit et liber homo suit. Ibi in hid\u00e6 geldabiles. Terra est v carrucis. In dominio sunt n carruc\u00e6, et ix servi, et nn Villani, et unus Radman, et Faber, cum n carrucis inter omnes.

Picot de Sai, whose vast estates lay chiefly in the Borders of South Shropshire, seems to have cherished the few Manors which he had near Shrewsbury. In each case he had at least doubled the value of these estates, since they had come into his possession. Earl Hugh's less suspicious Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey pur ports to have the attestation of Pigot de Say ; but what is far more consistent with probabilities, it records how Pigot de Say had given to the Abbey two-thirds of the tithes of his demesnes of Phittesho and of Gulidone. In fact, as I have stated under Brompton,5 an 1 Alluding to Haughton (vide supra, Vol. VII. page 281). 3 Supra, page 64. 4 Domesday, fo. 258, a, 2. s Supra, Vol. VI. p. 170. Rot. Hundred. II. 76."], [595, "145 FITZ undoubtedly genuine Charter of Picot de Say himself, attested by Earl Hugh, gives, inter alia, two-thirds of the tithes of Fittesho and Gullidon for the building and maintenance of the conventual Church. These tithes were subsequently confirmed in the Royal Charters of Henry I., Stephen, Henry II. and Henry III. ; being described loosely as the tithes of Phitesoth, Fitesso, or Fiteshod. The Charters of Bishops Clinton and Peche are more particular, and specify \"two-thirds of the demesne-tithes of Gulidone and Fitesso \" as belonging to the Abbey by grant of a Benefactor. Fitz and Gulidone came in due course to Isabel de Say, Baroness of Clun, and passed from her to her descendants by the first Wil liam fitz Alan. The two Manors are sometimes associated under the common name of Fitz. Robert de Gyros, of whom we have heard so oflen as a Feoffee of the Barons of Holgate, was Fitz Alan's Feoffee at Fitz. I think his Feoffor must have been Isabel de Say after her first husband's decease, or her son William fitz Alan (II), for there is nothing in the Clun Feodary of 1165 which can be taken to indicate any such previous feoffment. On the death of Robert de Gyros (about 1190-4), his lands, under whomsoever held, were farmed for a time by the King's Escheator.1 Hence at Michaelmas 1194 the said Officer accounts for \u00a33. Is. 4c?., as half a year's ferm of Robert de Girros's estate of Fittesho. A similar half-year's ferm is accounted for in the Escheat-Roll of 1195 ; but the year's corn-crop of Fittesho had been sold for a further sum of \u00a310. As I have often before stated, Robert de Gyros (II) seems to have had a general livery of his inheritance about March 1195. In 1200, as we shall see, he was a party to a suit concerning the Ad vowson of Fitz. About 25 years later, Robert de Gyros commenced a series of dealings with his Manors of Fitz and Gulidon which transferred the most valuable parts of them to Haughmond Abbey. First, about the year 1225, \" he sets his two Mills of Fittes to the Canons, to farm during his life. They are to pay him 8 merks annual rent and to grind his own corn toll-free ; but at his death the Canons are to have the Mills without payment of any rent.

He paid 2 merks for license to levy the same. It bears date at Westminster, Feb. 9, 1245. Robert de Gyroys (through Richard de Cruce, his Attorney) acknowledges his gifts to Abbot Gilbert of the Manor of Gulydon, and of one virgate, two tofts, two Mills, and the Advowson of Fyttesho, unde placitum warranti\u00e6 cart\u00e6 The prayers and good offices of the Abbey were the consideration. The latest notice which I have of Robert de Girros is in October 1250, when a Plea of land was pending between him and the Dean of St. Mary's. On Nov. 3, 1251, his widow, Isabella, was suing the Abbot of Haghmon for dower, viz. one-third of the Manor of Myrydon (heretofore called Gulydone), except the park, and one third* of 2 Mills and a virgate in Fytesho. The widow's suit for dower was effectual, but Thomas de Constantine and Walter de Hopton, as heirs of Robert de Girros, were bound to warrant their Uncle's Charters, and the Court ordered Isabella's dower to be made good out of their lands elsewhere. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 states as follows. \u2014 \"Walter 1 He probably had a Park at Addcote, in Little Ness."], [598, "148 FITZ de Hopton and Thomas de Costentin hold vm geldable hides in Fittesho. It is of the fee of John fitz Alan, and held by service of a knight's-fee in time of war, at Oswestry.1 They do suit to County and Hundred, and pay 4s. 8d. for stretward and motfee.\"2 Here I may observe that this payment of 4s. 8c?. is proportionate to a Manor of only seven hides, and yet that the collective Domes day hidage of Fitz and Gellidone was no more than 5 hides. Such a change on Domesday measurement was in a very unusual direc tion, and requires explanation. I can only suggest that the seven hides of 1255 were inclusive of Mytton, a Manor of 2 hides, which circumstances had associated with Fitz and Gellidone. The Pipe-Roll of 1261 gives Walter de Hopton and Thomas de Costentine as jointly fining half a merk for some judicial Writ ; \u2014 probably relating to De Girros's inheritance. On July 7, 1271, Walter de Hopton has a Writ against John Fitz Alan for disseizing him of common pasture in Fittes. On October 20, 1277, a Fine was levied between Walter de Hopton and Thomas de Constantin (Plaintiffs), and Alan Abbot of Haweman (Tenant) of 3 messuages, 2 tofts, 1 Mill, and 2 carucates and 1 virgate of land, in Guledon and Futtesho. The Plaintiffs acknowledged the Abbot's right, under grant of Robert de Gyros, Uncle of Thomas, and kinsman (cons angu inei3) of Walter, whose heirs they are ; the premises to hold to the Abbot in pure alms, without any rent to the Plaintiffs, but the Abbot performing forinsec services. Moreover Walter de Hopton conceded to the Abbot 2 messuages and a virgate, held by two Villains in Guledon. In return, the Abbot paid Walter 20 merks, and conceded to him 2 messuages and a virgate in Fittesho, held by two Villains of the Abbot. Moreover the Abbot conceded to Walter two tofts in Fittesho, which the same two Villeins some time held, but for this Walter was to pay the Abbot 6s. rent, which payment was not to entitle the Abbot to any homage, fealty, relief, aid, wardship, custody, scutage, pontage, hidage, or heriot, from Walter or his heirs. This Concord was made at Shrewsbury, the said Villeins being present and allowing that they wrere Villeins. The Pimhill Tenure- Roll of 1279 merely states \" Fittis to be held of Fitz Alan by service of one knight for 15 days in wartime 1 A proof that the feoffment of De Girros was not earlier than the time of Wilham fitz Alan (II), for a Tenure in Clun Barony would not have been charged with serrice at Oswestry before the two Baronies were united. 2 Rot.

The In quest taken at Fittes on August 18, 1290, after Adam de Montgo mery's death, found him to have died seized of half the Manor, which half was held of the Earl of Arundel by a quarter of a knight's fee. His heir was his son Robert (born March 2, 1272), so far as the estates of tbe said Robert's Mother (Isabella de Constantine) were concerned.1 These estates were at Oldbury, Eatcii Constan tine, Burwarton, Sontford (near Knokin), and Fittes. I have fol lowed the descent of Isabella de Constantine a step further under Eaton Constantine, but the difficulties there stated I am unable to solve. As to Walter de Hopton, I have said much of him in a far more exalted position than as Coheir of De Girros. His marriage with the Baroness of Wem made him a great man during her life, but at her death little seems to have remained to him in virtue of that alliance. He remarried, but died before March 10, 1305, wheu the King's Writ of Diem clausit announced his decease. The King's concern in the matter was because the Suzerain of the deceased, viz. the heir of Richard Earl of Arundel, was in ward to the Crown. The subsequent Inquest found Walter de Hopton to have held the vill of Fittes, with the hamlets of Mucton (Mytton) and Grafton, of the said heir and of the Barony of Clun, by service of one-sixth of a knight's-fee. Walter, his son and heir, was two years old and over.3 We shall recur to his name and descent on future pages. Suffice it to say here, that, in the Nomina Villarum of 1316, this In fant, Walter de Hopton, is set down as sole Lord of the Vill of Fittes. Haughmond Fee. I will include under this head the Abbot's temporalities in Gellidone, as well as in Fitz and other places.

This was originally a dependence of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury ; but when that Collegiate Church lost its hold upon its Manor of Mytton it seems also to have lost its hold on the Advowson of Fitz Chapel ; and (as we have seen) Robert de Girros both claimed this Advowson and alienated it to Haughmond Abbey. At a much earlier period, Picot de Say's grant of tithes of his demesnes at Fitz to Shrewsbury Abbey seems to have been an arbitrary alienation, and injurious to local interests. Of the consequent litigation and animosity, the following documents give only the outline. \u2014 On Oc tober 6, 1200, there was a suit pending at Westminster, concerning the \" Advowson of the Church of Fittesh'.\" The Bishop of Bangor (then Robert de Shrewsbury1), the Canons of St. Mary's, and Ro bert de Gyros were parties thereto. All that transpires is that it was adjourned. We next hear of Robert de Girros conveying this Advowson, not merely by Charter, but by a dated Fine of February 9, 1245, to Haughmond Abbey. In October, 1253, the following mem oranda appear on a Roll of Pleas, before the Queen and the King's Council at Westminster. \u2014 \" The Abbot of Haghmon names Brother Nicholas de London his Attorney against the Dean and Chapter of Salop in a plea of Quo Waranto.\" This was doubtless about the Advowson of Fitz, but a second entry shows that the Abbot had already suborned force in tbe matter, though his direct agency does not appear. \u2014 \" Henry, Abbot of Salop, hath been attached to give answer to the King in this placitum, viz. as to wherefore, prejudic ing the King and his Free Chapel of St. Mary, Salop (which Chapel is so exempted as that neither the Pope nor any judge ecclesiastic has jurisdiction therein), he (the Abbot) had exercised a jurisdiction in the Chapel of Fytesho, appurtenant to St. Mary's, viz. by de spoiling the Clerks of St. Mary's of the said Chapel, which Clerks had obtained the said Chapel by collation of the Dean and Chapter of St. Mary's ?\" Specifically, Lawrence de Brok, the Crown pro secutor, now stated that \" the aforesaid Abbot had sent his men to the Church of Fittesho, (in which Church the King's Bailiffs had 1 It is probable that Robert de Shrews bury was Dean of St. Mary's both before and after his consecration to the See of Bangor.

The Abbot's men had further broken open a chest with jewels therein, and had carried away the goods and the coin of the King's pre sentee.\" Abbot Henry now appeared before the Council. He denied the violence and injury alleged. He said that he had acted under mandate of Master Hugh de St. Edmund, who then had ju risdiction in all concerns of the Crucesignati. \u2014 The said Hugh, by letters which the Abbot produced, had ordered the Abbot to do in stant justice in behalf of Robert de Acton, Clerk, a Crucesignatus, and Parson of the Chapel of Fittesho, in respect of injuries done to the said Robert de Acton by Richard de Houton, Canon of St. Mary's and others. So far went the Abbot's affair on this occasion. On Oct. 20 following, in the same Court, Laurence de Brok (for the Crown) sued Robert de Acton, Hervey de Hope, and William fitz Roger for forcibly entering the Chapel of Fitesho, an appurtenance of St. Mary's, and for breaking open in the said Chapel a chest of Isabella de Constantine.1 This matter went no further ; for the Sheriff reported to the Council that Robert de Acton was a fugitive, and that his lands and goods had been confiscated to the Crown. Then again the Crown Prosecutor called for John Ernald, a Monk of Shrewsbury, for Reginald de Ragdon, Richard fitz Thomas, Alan, Clerk of Salop, and Philip Smith of Prestcote, for the same offence. They were not forthcoming ; aud the Sheriff was ordered to attach them. In Hilary Term 1254 Roger Ernaud and the others were still not to be found. Also attachment issued against the Manu captors of Robert de Acton. They were Adam Wele, Hugh de Longslow, Robert de Prene, Alan de Buildwas, John de Pres, and Ranulf de Rodinton. At length however the great culprit himself, Robert de Acton, appeared before the Council. He surrendered the Chapel of Fitz, by license of the Court, to the King. He also allowed that the Sheriff should ascertain what chattels he had taken from the Chest, and should realize an equivalent out of his (Robert de Acton's) lands. The resignation of Robert de Acton, whose ul terior history has been traced elsewhere,2only produced further litiga tion about the Advowson of Fitz Chapel.

They said that \"the Dean of St. Mary's presents to the Chapel of Fitches, and that Master Richard de Lynton holds it, and that is worth 7 merks yearly, but is not accounted among the 10 Prebends of St. Mary's.\" It is added by interlineation that \" the Abbot of Hageman claims to be Patron, et vi ejus ven' (pro bably vices ejus veniunt, that is, his interests are represented) by Master William de Kilkenny.\"1 A Writ of K.

The Bishop is therefore to admit the Abbot's Presentee to the said Parsonage. Bishop Weseham, in a Letter dated at Brewood Nov. 25, 1256, recites the above Writ and trans mits the exemplification to the Abbey, Ralph de Chaddesden, Trea surer of Lichfield, Sir Nicholas de Leger, William de Weseham, and James de Bakepuz, attesting.

Robert de Acton, the intruder of 1253, was probably the No minee of Haghmon Abbey. He resigned in 1254. Richard de Lynton was apparently reinstated. He was holding the Chapel in the summer of 1256, but obliged to resign, I presume, in the following Autumn. Master William de Kilkenny seems to have been the counter nominee of the Abbot of Haghmon.

The Says, or their descendants, the Fitz Alans, so farmed the estate as that it became a mere member of their secular tenure at Fitz. It was part of the feoffment of Robert de Gyros, and it would appear that one of the two Mills, given by him to Haghmon Abbey, was in Mytton rather than in Fitz. The said Mill was at all events claimed by the Chapter of St. Mary's as being theirs, and they made the King, as usual, a party to the lawsuit of his own free Chapel. In October 1253 \"the King appeared in a suit of Quo Waranto against the Abbot of Haghmon, as to where fore the Abbot held a Mill in Mutun, which Mill belonged to the King's Free Chapel in Salop.\"3 I cannot trace this suit any fur ther, but it would appear that on Robert de Gyros's death in 1251 the Dean and Chapter not only sought to recover Mytton Mill, but took actual possession of the whole Manor. They were of course impleaded for the same by Robert de Gyrros's heirs. The suit came on at the County Assizes of January 1256, and ended in the defeat of the Dean and Chapter.

Clive too is a Cha pelry of St. Mary, and it is probable that a Church, served by the Domesday Priest, existed at Clive when the Record was written. In 1255 this estate of St. Mary's is described simply as Clive, and was reputed to contain one, if not two, hides less than we should have expected from Domesday. \u2014 \"The Dean and Canons of St. Mary, Salop, hold nn geldable hides in Clive, and it is the King's almoign to his Chapel of Salop.

Broughton) in the Liberties of Shrewsbury. That Parish, I can have no hesitation in saying, was anciently a Chapelry of St. Chad, and the Domesday Priest of Yorton probably served a Church at Broughton. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255, says that \" the Dean and Canons of St. Chad, Salop, hold iiii hides in Burhton and Iyarton of the fee of the Bishop of Chester. They owe no suit, and have a Franchise, the Jurors know not by what warranty.\"3 This passage favours a former surmise, viz. that St. Chad's Church held all its Manors, both before and after the Conquest, immediately under the Bishop of Chester.3 We also see that while St. Mary's Manor had lost one or two of its Domesday hides, St. Chad's Manor retained its ancient complement. The Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279, says that \" Broughton and Yourketon are held ofthe Dean of St. Chad's, Salop, in free socage;\" and that \" the Dean holds of the Bishop of Chester free of any ser vice.\" Of the Socagers of St. Chad at Broughton and Yorton, the fol lowing notices are offered. \u2014 Alan de Burcton occurs as a frequent witness of local Deeds, from about 1220 to about 1240.

Martin de Burchton's wife, Elina, seems to have been an heiress to lands at Pitchford and Acton\" Burnell, which lands they sold to Robert Burnell in 1272.1 At the Assizes of that same year, Martin de Burgthon recovered 5 acres in Burgthon, of which he had been disseized by Philip de Paunton, Agatha his wife, Petronilla de Burgthon, Richard Puleby, William Page, and Richard fitz William of Albrithton. Philip de Paunton's defence was that he had custody of the premises as the nearest friend of (his wife) Agatha. In Michaelmas Term 1282, Margery, widow of William de Franketon, having first sued Richard Robuk, and Agnes his wife, under writ of morte d'ancestre, for 2 nokes and a messuage in Yor thon, afterwards agreed that the Defendants, and the heirs of Richard, should hold the premises ; and Richard agreed to pay 10 merks to Alan Pride of Salop. John, son of Martin de Burchton, was a Juror for Pimhill Hun dred at the Assizes of 1292. He was preceded on the list by Alan de Burchton, who occurs also on Juries of the previous year. In 1308, Robert de Burcton attests a local Deed. Broughton Chapel. Of this, as a mere Dependency of St. Chad, we are not likely to hear much. Even the Officiating Minis ters of St. Chad's itself received no institution from the Diocesan Bishop till after the Reformation. Some extracts from a Valuation of the estates of the Collegiate Church of St. Chad, taken after its dissolution in 1547, will form a fitting conclusion to this Chapter. \u2014 The Church, Glebe, tithes, and profits of St. Margaret of Broughton, were formed by Roger Bromeley, of Broughton, and Joan his wife, under lease of the late Chapter, dated April 3, 1543, and terminable with the life of the surviving Lessee. Bromeley was bound by the said lease to pay 24s. rent to the Dean of St. Chad ; 6c?. for annual synodals ; \u00a3A. 6s. 8d. to an officiating Chaplain; \u00a36. 16s. 8c?. rent to the general funds of the College ; and 16s. 8c?. rent to four of the Prebendaries, for the tithes of Yartou. The only other receipt which the Chapter had from this estate, besides Bromeley's rents, was 5s. 4c?. rent from lands at Yarton. One of the Prebends of St. Chad was called the Prebend of Yarton, but its endowment was not wholly in Yarton, and it was divided among four Prebendaries. \" The said Churche of Broughton \" (added the Surveyor) \" is a Parishe Churche in the Countrie.\" The late Dean and Chapter having had all the tithes 1 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 130."], [620, "164 BICTON. of the \" towne \" of Broughton and Yarton, had had it in charge to provide a curate to minister there, but now Roger Bromleye's lease bound him to find the said Curate, and to pay the other rents above specified.1 33ict.om We may now proceed with those other estates in Bascherch Hundred, which Domesday exhibits as held from Saxon times by the Church of St. Chad. \u2014 Ipsa \u00c6cclesia tenuit Bichetone.

Of this William we have already had several notices in 1174, 1199, and 1203.3 The Pipe-Roll of 1209 records an amercement of 6s. 8c?. against William de Bikedene quia retraxit se. It was probably another William de Bykedon, who by a Fine levied at Huntingdon on Nov. 5, 1247, concedes 2\\ virgates in Bykedon to Nicholas, Abbot of Buildwas, whereof had been Plea of Warranty. He \" concedes the land, with the site of a Grange, and with 3 seilions, near the Manor-house (curiam) of Gil bert fitz William, and with a road from Bykedon into the King's Highway, which went from Moneford bridge to Salop ; and with heather for the Abbot's Granges at Mole (Monk Meole) and at Bykedon.\" There had been an actual suit, tried at Cambridge in the previous month, to oblige William de Bykedon to give the above warranty. He had been declared in contempt of the Court for hesi tating to appear, and all his lands had been seized by the Sheriff.4 Hence I suppose an amercement of 6s. 8d. recorded in the Pipe- Roll of 1250, against William, son of Thomas de Bykedone, quia retraxit se} In October 1250 and October 1251, I find notes of a cause wherein the Abbot of Buildwas was trying to compel William de Bykedon to observe the Fine levied at Huntingdon.

In 1255 William de Bukedon was dead, and the Pimhill Hundred-Roll states that \" his heirs hold in hides in Bukedon of the fee of St. Chad, Salop, and have a franchise ; \u2014 the Jurors knew not by what warranty.\"1 I have shown under Oaks that the heirs of William de Bicton were his two daughters Isabella and Margery, and that Isabella became the wife of Thomas, son of Richard Gourdin.3 Now Richard Gourdin, Isabella's father-in-law, is set down on the Assize-RoR of 1256 as one of twelve knights of Pimhill Hun dred who had made some default and were in misericordid. It is probable that he had the wardship of Isabella, and married her to his own son. He himself however occurs on Juries of Pimhill Hundred in 1255, 1256, 1272, and 1274. In the last instance he is expressly styled Richard Gurdin de Bykedon, though it is certain that his son, Thomas, had already married Isabella.3 I can trace nothing more of the interest of either of these coheirs of Bicton. The PimhiU Tenure-Roll of 1279 says that \"Wilhel mus quondam Dominus de Bicton tenet (read tenuit) Bicton de feodo Sancti Ceddi, Salop.\" In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, the Dean of St. Chad's himself is entered as Lord of the Vill of Bike don. These general expressions show only that the parties record ing them were ignorant of details. Recurring to the year 1247 we have seen that besides William de Bicton, Lord of Bicton, there was one Gilbert fitz William hav ing a Curia, or Manor- House, and probably a co-ordinate tenure in the Manor. Also, there was a William Bykedon, a Recognizer in 1256, in a trial which concerned Great-Sleap (in this Hundred). It was doubtless the son of this last William whom we have seen as \" Thomas, son of William de Bikedon,\" to have been enfeoffed in land at Bicton, before 1272, by Margery, one of the Coheiresses above named.3 Again Thomas de Bykedone was one of the Jurors of Pimhill Hundred at the Inquest of November 1274. Lastly we have a Deed, said, or implied, to have passed after the statute of mortmain (1279), whereby \"Thomas, son of William de Bikedone, gives to Buildwas Abbey all the land which he had, or should be able to have, in the Vill of Bikedone, with the Houses, &c, appur- 1 Rot.

I. (1285-6) which related to the acquisition of lands in Bikedon and other places by the Abbot of Buildwas.3 It is very probable that this Inquest was a correla tive of the above Deed, and it is quite certain that, at the period, such an Inquest would naturally be required as a preliminary to any relaxation of the Statute of Mortmain. At this time a moiety of the Seigneury of Bicton was in the hands of Geoffrey Randolf, a thriving Burgess of Shrewsbury, of whose father, William, I have said something under Newport. He had apparently acquired it from that very Thomas fitz William whom we have just seen giving the fee of an estate at Bicton to Buildwas Abbey. On May 8, 1288, this Geoffrey, styling himself \" Geoffrey Randulf de Novo Burgo, of Salop \" (that is, Geoffrey Randulf of Newport, resident at Salop), gives to Buildwas Abbey the capital messuage of the vill of Bikedone, with the curtilage be longing thereto, and with all seigneuries (dominiis), liberties, &c, pertaining to a moiety of the seigneury (dominationis) of the vill of Bykedone ; \u2014 to hold in frank almoign, rendering to the Dean of St. Chad the due and accustomed service for the moiety of the said vill.

Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Robert Cor bet, Thomas de Roshal, John de Lee, and John de Arundel, knights ; John, Lord of Hanewode, John le Waleys, Reginald de Roshal, and Roger de Hortone.3 Geoffrey Randolf next occurs as actual Tenant or occupant of an estate at Bicton, the Seigneury whereof was in Buildwas, and the Fee of which he purposed to give to the Abbey. A Writ of Jan. 18, 1291, orders it to be ascertained by Inquest, whether Geoffrey Ran dolph's design of giving 2 messuages and 60 acres in Bykedon to the said Abbey was injurious to the Crown? The Jurors replied that Geoffrey held the premises under the Abbey, and the Abbey held under St. Chad's Church. Geoffrey's service to the Abbey 1 LBlakeioay's Parochial Notices (in Bibl. | Bodl.

His plan would not injure the Crown, except that, so far as he had been liable to serve in Assizes, Juries, and Inquests, and (when resident at Bicton) to attend the Dean of St. Chad's Court of Frank-pledge, these services would now be lost. He had other lands in the town of Shrewsbury and elsewhere, which would still oblige his attendance on Assizes, &c. ; so that the Coun try would not endure any unusual burden by the removal of his liabilities in respect of Bicton.1 A Patent of November 12, 1291, gives Geoffrey Rondulf the required license, viz. to convey a mes suage and 80 (sic) acres in Bykedon to Buildwas Abbey.2 It would next seem that an expression in Thomas de Bicton's Charter of 1285-6 (as to giving to Buildwas, lands which he might obtain in Bicton) was not mere technical verbiage. On November 25, 1291, a Fine was levied whereby John son of John le Vileyn of Salop (Impedient), surrenders to Thomas de Bygedon (Plaintiff) 2 messuages and \\\\ virgates in Bykedon ; to hold of the Lords of the Fee. This Fine purports to be the result of a Plea of Warranty, and the consideration (a sore hawk) makes it probable that it was levied only for security of title. How much of the acquisitions of Buildwas Abbey at Bicton is recorded in the Taxation of 1291 I cannot say. The Abbot had 2 carucates of land here, valued at \u00a31 per annum. The profits on his live stock were j63. 10s. ; and the assized rents of Bykedon were 3s. Total \u00a3A. 13s.3 A word more about Geoffrey Randolf and Thomas de Bikedon. The former served as one of the Bailiffs of Shrewsbury six times between 1290 and 1323 ; the latter was in the same office no less than twelve times between 1273 and 1319. In 1296 we have Geoffrey Randolf as a Benefactor of the Augustine Friars of Shrews bury.4 In 1308 Geoffrey Randolf (acknowledging certain rents as due from himself to Wombridge Priory, for premises in Shrewsbury) styles himself \" Geoffrey Rondolf of Salop, son of William Rondolf of Newport.\" Thomas de Bekedon, then Bailiff of Salop, stands first witness of these acknowledgments.5 Two Bicton Fines levied October 6, 1301, may be by Under tenants of Buildwas Abbey, or by immediate Tenants of St. Chad. -\u2014\"Reginald de Rossall and Isolda his wife enfeoff William Hawe lithe and Juliana his wife in a messuage and 21 acres in Bikedon, 4 Inquis. 24 Edw.

As the same Feoffees held both parts of Onslow in the 13th century, I cannot be sure that all the following notes relate to St. Chad's share. In part they are supplementary of what has been said of the other share.1 In Easter Term, 1209, William fitz Ralph appears as Essoignor of William de Bikedon, who had a suit of mort d'ancestre against John de Haldeslawe. Roger de Onslow has lately occurred to us in 1250 as Roger de Wendelawe.3 The Pimhill Hundred- Roll of 1255 gives Roger de Ondeslauwe as second of the Jurors, who reported (inter alia) that \" he held a hide of land in that Hundred, of the Fee and Liberty of St. Chad.\"3 At the Assizes of 1256 he was again on the Jury for Pimhill Hun dred, but in 1272 and 1274 he, or another of his name, officiated in a like way for Ford Hundred. He occurs on a Meole Jury in 1273. The Pimhill Tenure- Roll of 1279 says that Roger Onslow holds Onslow, of St. Chad's Church, by service of 4s. Meantime, that is in July 1259, I find Richard de Ondeslaue charging the Prior of the English Hospitallers with disseizing him of a tenement in Eyar ton. Eyarton I suppose to be Yarton, but I cannot say what the Knights Hospitallers had obtained there, nor do I find the Ons lows afterwards concerned in the Manor. In 1292 there appears to have been some distinction in the Te nants of the two parts of Onslow ; for while John de Ondeslauwe was a Juror for Ford Hundred, William de Ondeslawe was Juror for Pimhill. On February 28, 1543, the Dean and Chapter of St. Chad de mised all the revenues of their College (except the tithes of Brough ton and Yorton) for 61 years, and on terms for which I refer else where,4 to Humphrey Onslow, Esq., of Onslow. It is worth ob serving that neither this Lease, nor the Survey of the Revenues of St. Chad's (taken at its Dissolution in 1547) makes mention of any part of such revenues as arising from Onslow itself. St. Chad's share of the Manor seems in fact to have been both rent-free and tithe-free. 1 Supra, Vol. VIL pp. 171-173. 2 Supra, page 165. 3 Rot. Hundred. II. 75. 4 Hist.

Among the Confirmations to Lilleshull, that of King John, in August 1199, best shows that Preston Gubbalds had, like other estates of St. Alkmund, passed to the Abbey. It confirms Preston and Lee con secutively, and lower down on the list comes Preston-juxta-Mone ford. The first Preston was Preston Gubbalds; and Lee (near Pimhill) was a member thereof. An early Rent-Roil of the Abbey gives Preston Gubald as producing \u00a31. 5s. 9c?. in Michaelmas Term, and 16s. 2c?. in Lent Term, while the Chapel of Preston Gubald produced 13 merks (\u00a38. 13s. 4c?.) yearly. At the Assizes of 1221 the Jurors of Shrewsbury complained how Anian de Preston, who had committed larceny and been cap tured with his booty upon him, had been committed to gaol till the Abbot of Lilleshull demanded to try him in his own Court. Being the \" Abbot's man,\" he had been given up, but the Jurors knew not how he had been dealt with. A Fine levied October 20, 1227, may possibly belong to Preston Montford, though I think that I rightly insert it here. \u2014 \" Hugh de Alminton and Alice his wife, Tenants of half a hide in Preston, surrender the same, for themselves and the heirs of Alice, to Wil liam, Abbot of Lilleshull, who gives them 5-| merks.\" The Pim hill Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" the Abbot of Lilleshull holds nn hides in Preston-Gubald, and it pertains to St. Alkmund's Church, and is of the Fee of the King.\"3 Iu 1279 the Pimhill Tenure-Roll says that \"the Abbot of Lilleshill holds the vill of Preston with its members of the King in capite, and it is geldable and pertains to the Church of St. Alkmund, Salop.\" 1 Domesday, fo. 253, a, 1. ** Rot.

I have spoken of the Shropshire Lees under localities and with interests too numerous to recapitulate. The chief branches of one family are traceable to a common birthplace and origin.\u2014 Reiner de Lee, who purchased Alderton in or about the year 1196, and who served as Deputy Sheriff of Shropshire in 1201, was previously Tenant-in-fee of the Abbot of Lilleshull in that member of Preston Gubbalds which gave him his name. From him the place was anciently called Reyner' s-Lee ; \u2014 as in an old Rent- Roil of Lilleshull Abbey, where 2s. 2c?. is put down as the ferm of Lee Reineri, due at Michaelmas, and 2s. as the ferm of the same, due at Midlent.3 The Lilleshall Chartulary further supplies the following statement, apparently an extract taken from some Inquest of the time of Reiner de Lee. \u2014 \" The Jurors say that Reginald de Lee holds the vill of Lee of the Abbot of Lilleshull, and it pertains to the vill of Preston Gobalt, and he pays to the Abbot 4s. 4c?. for all (services)^ The same Reginald holds one carucate in demesne, which is worth 20s. per annum. Item, Roger de Lee holds half a virgate in the same, in villeinage, of the demesne of Reginald ; and it is worth in rents and other manorial services (operibus) os. per annum.\"2 We have seen that about 1220-60 Sir Thomas de Lee (son of the above Reyner) gave to Reyner, his younger son, the whole vill of La Lee subtus Pebenhul.3 The next allusion to this estate is in 50 Edward III.

The joint settlement ou Joanna, wife and afterwards widow of the said Roger, resulted at her death (Sept. 18, 1400), in an Inquest, finding that \"she had died seized of a messuage and carucate of land in La Lee, which she had held of Robert Lee of Roden by service of one penny per annum.\"2 I should explain that Robert de Lee of Roden, thus mentioned as Mesne-Lord of Lee, was descended from a son of Thomas de Lee, older than Reyner, the son and original Feoffee of the same Thomas. Hence probably the mediate right of Robert. However, as he had married Petronilla, daughter and heir of his distant kinsman (Roger), and of Joanna (Roger's wife) the two interests in Lea became recon solidated in the persons of the said Robert and his descendants.3 Cherlton. I have already set forth an Inquest (circa 1200-20) which gives some idea of the value and extent of a certain member of Preston- Gubbalds called Cherloton} An early Rent-Roll of Lilleshull Abbey describes the same estate by a name which I can not account for, but which was evidently used to distinguish it from Cherlton near Shawbury. \u2014 The Abbey was in receipt of 2s. at Mi chaelmas, and Is. at Midlent, from the land of St. Elstrud of Chorle ton, or the land of Chorleton Sanct\u00e6 Elstrud'.

Nigel de Shawbury and his son Robert, both living in the reign of Henry I., were successive Lords, not only of Shawbury but of Besford, and of that part of Preston Brockhurst which we shall see to have been always associated with Besford. Consequently we find Shawbury, Besford, and this part of Preston, often combined as one Manor. The three last Lords of Shawbury of this line were Wido de Shawbury (murdered in 1200-1) and his brothers, Nigel and Richer. We can prove their connection with Besford in particular, by their grants to Haugh mond Abbey. \u2014 \" Wido de Saubery gave to the said Abbey, in sup port of the Conventual Infirmary, his Mill of Besford, with the Vivary thereof, reserving to himself and his heirs a certain preced ence as to grinding their corn, and of grinding it toll-free.\" Nigel and Richer, brothers of the said Wido, confirmed his grant in sepa rate Charters. When King John, on the forfeiture of Richer de Shawbury, granted Shawbury to Thomas de Erdinton, Besford and part of Preston passed as mere appurtenances. We have more than one proof of this ; for instance, Thomas de Erdinton's widow, in 1227, released her dower not only in Shawbury but in Besse ford ;3 also Besford and Preston were more or less involved* in that great suit of \" Erdinton versus Audley,\" which I have detailed at length under Shawbury, and which lasted from 1236 to 1239. We shall have further proof in the sequel that Erdinton, as Lord of Shawbury, continued also to have the Seigneury over Besford and part of Preston till a much later period. But I must now speak more exclusively of Besford and of the family which came to hold it in fee under the Lords of Shawbury. \u2014 William Griffyn, towards the close of the 12th, or the begin ning of the 13th, century, attests Ada de Beauchamp's Charter to Stone Priory, a Charter to which I have already made incidental reference.3 Late in the year 1200 William Grifin gave King John 30 merks and a Palfrey \" that he might hold the Serjeantry of the Staffordshire Hundred of Pirehill in fee ;\"4 that is, he fined for the Bailiwick of the said Hundred, to be held hereditarily, and as a Serjeantry, under the Crown. William Griffin had, I think, two 1 Domesday, fo. 259, a, 1. 2 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 139. 3 Supra, Vol. IX. p. 374, note 1. 4 Oblata, page 81."], [633, "175 BESFORD. sous, Geoffrey, a Clerk, and Bertram. The two presumed brothers will be found attesting Henry de Audley's. Foundation-Charter of Hilton Abbey in 1223.1 fit is further apparent of\u2014 Bertram Griffin, that Henry de Audley enfeoffed him in Bes ford. This must have been between the years 1218 and 1236, that is, during the period while Audley (as was afterwards proved) held Shawbury and its appurtenances wrongfully. Hence it was that, when in 1236 Giles de Erdinton sued Henry de Audley for Shaw bury, he also sued Bertram Griffin for 10 virgates thereof; and hence it was that the said Bertram instantly called Henry de Aud ley to warranty, and left him sole Defendant in the cause. Of the two brothers, Bertram and Geoffrey, I suppose Bertram to have been the eldest. He seems to have succeeded to his paternal inheritance, viz. the Bailiwick of Pirehill Hundred, in 1228. A Patent of September 5, in that year, certifies the men of that Hun dred that the King had received Bertram Griffin's homage for the same. When, in the year 1239, the suit of \" Audley versus Er dinton \" ended in Audley's total discomfiture, and ejectment from Shawbury, it appears that his loss involved his Feoffee. Bertram Griffin continued no longer to hold Besford under Giles de Erdinton, the restored Lord of Shawbury. But, at the close of the above Trial, an incident occurred which requires explanation. Bertram Griffin came forward and stated that, in respect of one virgate of land, and the abutment of a stank, he was independent of either party to the current litigation.3 This meant, I think, that he had not acquired the said virgate by feoffment of Audley, but in some other way. \u2014 Now there was a virgate of land in Besford which some early Lord of Shawbury had given to Haughmond Abbey. We have no Charter conveying the gift, but we have a Charter showing the Abbot to have been in possession of the said virgate, and to have given it to Geoffrey (not Bertram) Griffin, about the year 1235.3 This affair, which was really part of an exchange, has been already described. Suffice it to observe that \" Geoffrey Griffin, Clerk, and Bertram his brother\" appear from their joint attestation of a Deed, incidental to the transaction, to have acted in concert. Thus far we have Charters to guide us. The next step is matter of assumption. I conceive that Geoffrey Griffin, the wealthy Rector of Edgmond, had made this purchase in Besford with a view to consolidate his brother's estate there, that he forthwith consigned the said virgate to his said brother, and that the position which ' Monasticon, V. p. 716. \u25a0 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 142. 3 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 34."], [634, "176 BESFORD. Bertram took up in 1239 was equivalent to a declaration that he held this virgate neither under Audley nor Erdington, but by feoff ment of the Abbot of Haughmond. We have seen that Geoffrey Griffin is said to have died in 1253.1 On May 24, 1254, the King's Writ of Diem clausit announces the death of Bertram Griffin, \u2014 his brother. There were two Inquests on the occasion. One describes his Tenure of Pirehill Hundred and of the Manor of Cleyton, in Staffordshire, and says that Ber tram had died seized of 16s. rent in Besford and Preston (meaning Preston Brockhurst), which rent he had held under Haghmon Ab bey. This Inquest puts the age of Geoffrey, son and heir of the deceased, at 12 years on November 11, 1253. The other Inquest states the said Geoffrey to be 10 years of age, and makes the tenure of the deceased under Haghmon Abbey to be half a virgate in Bes ford and Preston.3 On October 10, 1254, Philip Lovel, the King's Treasurer, fined 100 merks for custody of the land and heir of Bertram Griffin.3 The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 is remarkably clear and ac curate about Besford. \u2014 \" Egidius de Erdinton holds 2| hides there.\" This was of the King's Fee, and an appurtenance of Shawbury, and was covered by the service of one knight, which Egidius owed in wartime for his collective tenures in Shropshire. Besford did no suit to county or Hundred, but paid 2s. for stretward and motfee (i. e. the sum proportionate to a Manor of 3 hides) . Again ; \u2014 \" in the same fee the heirs of Bertram Griffin hold one virgate (i. e. the remaining fourth of the third hide), and this was frank almoign of Haumon Abbey.\"4 I find no evidence of Geoffrey Griffin (II) re taining this small part of Besford. His mother Albreda was still living at his death in 1283, and holding a third of Clayton and of Pirehill Hundred in dower. His wife also survived him and was entitled to dower in his estates. He died seized of considerable property in Cheshire and Staffordshire, and, inter alia, of two thirds of the Serjeantry of Pirehill Hundred. Geoffrey Griffin (III), his son and heir, attained the age of 21 years on June 24, 1284 :5 \u2014 but of this family, as no longer connected with Shropshire, I need not give any further particulars.

Hence the Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 gives the following confused but quite explicable account, which I transcribe from the original, in order to make its errors apparent. \u2014 \" Besford. Rogerus de Pryde tenet Preston de Johanne de Chetwynd in capite Henrico de Erdynton in capite. Predictus Henricus tenet dictam villam de Domino Rege in capite et est membrum de Schawbere et infra libertatem.\" \u2014 The words which I have underlined are erroneous, those which I have printed in Italics are marked as erroneous in the original by a few transverse strokes of the Writer's pen. The errors arose from the Writer confusing Besford with part of Preston Brockhurst. Take Besford alone and tbe corrected passage describes it accu rately. After Henry de Erdinton's death in 1282, the Seigneury of Bes ford formed part of the dower of his widow Matilda. The Tenure- Rolls of 1284-5 say, one of them, that \" Besford is a member of Schaurburi and is held of the King in capite, rendering to the King 7d. per annum.\" The other Roll states more fully, and, I conceive, more accurately, that \" Roger Pryde, a Burgess of Salop, holds Besford, a member of Schawbere, in Pymhull Hundred, under Ma tilda de Erdinton.\" It will have been very shortly after this that \u2014 Robert Corbet of Moreton purchased the whole Manor of Besford, and 2 merks annual rent in Shawbury, from the above Roger Pride, who, of course by Corbet's desire, conveyed the whole to Corbet and his wife Matilda, conjointly. Robert Corbet, not content with being Tenant in fee-tail of Besford, resolved to get rid of all mediate rights there, whether Erdinton's or Pryde's. What parties he had to deal with, or how he dealt with subordi nates, I cannot tell ; but he so negotiated with the Crown as that he became Tenant-in- capite of Besford, holding it by service of one fourth part of a knight's-fee. This was not, however, without some previous trouble. \u2014 At the Assizes of October 1292, the Pimhill Jurors presented that \" Henry de Erdinton, having been Tenant-in capite of the vill of Basseford, had sold it to Roger Pryde, to hold under himself;\" and that \"Robert Corbet now held the vill.\" Robert Corbet, being summoned before the Court, petitioned that he mio-ht be allowed to hold the vill in capite sine media ; and he gave half a merk that he might have respite in regard of doing homao-e, till the next Parliament. His homage seems to have been accepted by Edward I. before the end of the year. However, x. ~3 a"], [636, "178 PRF.STON BROCKHURST. on January 9, 1293, a Writ of Quo Waranto was issued against him, for holding Placita Coron\u00e6 and ivayfm his Manor of Beseford. He appeared before the Justices (then in Staffordshire), denied claiming ivayf, but insisted on his right to determine, in bis two great Courts of the Manor, all such pleas as a Sheriff could ordi narily adjudicate upon in his Tourns. He said that he had the Manor, inclusive of this Franchise, by gift and feoffment of Roger Pryde, whose heir, Richard Pryde, he now called to warranty. The case was adjourned to be heard coram Rege on the morrow of the Ascension.1 On a still later day (June 25) Corbet failed to appear ; so the franchise in question was seized by the Crown.2 The Inquest on Robert Corbet's death details the fact of his pur chase of Besford, and the conjoint feoffment of his widow Matilda.3 Hence the Inquest on Matilda's death, in 1309, says that she was seized of the Vill of Besford, which she held of the King in capite, by service of a fourth part of a knight's-fee.4 Parochially Besford is in the Parish of Shawbury. A Chapel which tradition declares to have sometime existed at Besford was of course a mere dependency of Shawbury. Brocfejjurst. This was a divided Manor at Domesday. The part which Gerard de Tornai had, was that which we have seen subsequently connected with Besford and Shawbury. It may still be distinguished from the other part, as being in the Parish of Shawbury and in the Hundred of Bradford North. Domesday describes it as follows : \u2014 Isdem Gerardus tenet Prestone et Robertus de eo. Bertunt tenuit et liber homo suit. Ibi i virgata terr\u00e6. Terra est dimidi\u00e6 carruc\u00e6.

Tn the Pimhill Hundred- Roll of 1255, this part of Preston Toret (as it was then called) stands as one-third of a hide; \u2014 something more than its Domesday measurement. It is distinguished as of the \" Fee of Egidius de Erdinton ;\" that is, it was a member of Shawbury. \" Roger de Preston held it under the heirs of Bertram Griffin, and it shared the franchises of Egidius de Erdinton, the Jurors knew not by what title.\"1 It is obvious that Bertram Griffin had held this estate under Erdinton, and that he had acquired it, or rather the 7s. rent which it implied, from Roger de Harpcote. Roger de Preston, the tenant-in-fee and occupant, had probably continued undisturbed during all the changes which had befallen his Seigneurs. He figures on the Pimhill Jury-lists of 1255, 1256, 1272, and 1274, and also as a witness and Juror in more local affairs. The same, or another, Roger de Preston occurs about 1281, and in 1291 and 1293, under circumstances which connect him with this tenure and neighbour hood. Meantime it is clear that Robert Corbet had acquired the mesne lordship of this part of Preston, either directly from the heir of Griffin, or, as parcel of Besford, from Roger Pryde. In fact, I rather suppose, from Preston being confused with Besford in the Tenure- Roll of 1279, that this part of Preston had been previously acquired by Pryde from the heir of Griffin. When once Robert Corbet be came its Mesne-Lord we lose all notice of it as a distinct Manor, for he was Lord also of Besford and of the other part of Preston Brockhurst. Under one or other of those Manors we are therefore to suppose that the few acres now under notice were henceforth included. I am able indeed to give an instance where the very estate in question is described as \" in Besford.\" In 1290, or before, Roger de Preston had enfeoffed his son Bartholomew in 2 mes suages, one virgate, and 8 acres of meadow, all said to be in \"Besseford.\" Bartholomew had been outlawed for felony. The usual rule was that the King should have any Outlaw's estate for a year and a day, and that then it should revert to the Outlaw's Feoffor. In the present instance the Coroners (Sir John fitz Aer and Robert de Say) made the King's year and day over to Robert Corbet, on condition of his rendering account of the profits. An Inquest taken pursuant to a Writ of Nov. 28, 1291, found Robert i Rot. Hundred. II. 75."], [638, "180 PRESTON BROCKHURST. Corbet thus seized of, and thus accountable for, the outlaw's estate.1 As to Roger de Preston (the Outlaw's Feoffor and father), the In quest notices him as living, but says nothing of the reversionary right which I presume he had, or would have, on the expiration of the year and day. Very probably he surrendered it to Corbet, who was already his Seigneur ; but of so trivial a circumstance we are not likely to be informed. I now turn to the other and greater part of Preston Brockhurst, that which remains in Pimhill Hundred, and which was part of the Domesday Fief of Turold de Verley. The Record describes it thus -.\u2014Isdem Turoldus tenet Preston et Hunnit de eo. Ipse Hunni et Uluiet tenuerunt pro n maneriis et geldabant et liberi fuerunt. Terra est n carrucis. In dominio est una (carruca) et n servi et in Villani. Valebat, et valet modo xm solidos? An observation, often made already, and varied by very few exceptions, tells us to search for any Manor of Turold, among the Manors which were subsequently held by De Chetwynd under Fitz Alan ; and to search for anything, held by Hunnit, the Saxon, at Domesday, among the Manors which were afterwards held by the descendants of his countryman, Toret. This Rule held good with Preston, which at one time was called Preston-Toret from this very circumstance. I will speak fully of the Torets under Moreton, as well as say more than I have hitherto done of their Shropshire heirs, \u2014 the Corbets of Moreton and Wattlesborough. Meanwhile the following notes refer exclusively to their estate at Preston. \u2014 The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" Robert Corbet holds 1^ geldable hides in Preston Toret, and it is of the fee of John de Chetewinde, and held, together with other lands in Shropshire, by doing the service of half a knight's-fee for 40 days at Oswestry. The estate pays 6c?. for motfee and streteward\" (6c?. on each account, I presume) .3 The Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 says as follows : \u2014 Robertus de Preston tenet Preston de Johanne de Chetwynd in capite, per servicium unius montaris per xl dies ad Album Monasterium tem pore guerr\u00e6. Here we must understand Robert Corbet by Robert de Preston, for I cannot find any mention of a Robert de Preston likely to have been Corbet's Undertenant here. The service of one Montar for 40 days is equal to that of half a knight's-fee for the same pe riod, and must be taken to have covered Robert Corbet's liabilities both for Preston and Moreton. The Bradford Tenure Roll of 1284 well explains this, saying that \" Robert Corbet holds Moreton with 1 Inquis. 20 Edw. I., No. 68. J Domesday, fo. 258, a, 1. 3 Rot. Hundred. II. 75."], [639, "181 MORETON TORET. its members, to wit, Preston, in Pimhill Hundred, and Evelyth, in Brimstree Hundred, under Reginald de Chetwynd, who holds under the King in capite, for half a knight's-fee.\" The Inquest taken in 1301, on the death of Robert Corbet, values Preston as a member of Morton ; but this is all I can extract from a very defaced document. It is sufficient to state that Preston Brockhurst has remained for ages in a similar connection. Parochially, Preston Brockhurst was in the Parish of Shaw bury. A part of it is now in Moreton Corbet Parish, but Moreton Corbet itself was originally and ecclesiastically only a member of Shawbury. jHmtttm Zont, now jHoret-on \u20acoxbtt. Domesday surveys this Manor as one of Turold de Verley's, and in the following words : \u2014 Ipse Turoldus tenet Mortone et Hunnit de eo, cum fratre suo. Ipsi tenuerunt (tempore Regis Edwardi) et liberi homines fuerunt . Ibi i hida geldabilis. Terra est n carrucis. Ibi sunt (ii carruc\u00e6) cum v servis et uno bordario. Valebat x solidos. Modo (valet) xvi so lidos.1 Whatever were the misfortunes of Hunnit and his brother Ul uiet, it is certain that the descendants of their contemporary and compatriot, Toret, succeeded to some of their estates, and it is also certain that a lineal descendant of the said Toret is at this day Lord of Moreton Corbet. These are terms in which very few Shropshire estates can be spoken of. It is therefore becoming to trace so an cient an inheritance with the greatest attention through the earlier and darker period of its vicissitudes. Of Toret himself, I have spoken elsewhere,3 showing that he was a Shropshire Landowner not only in the reigns of Edward the Confessor and William L, but was surviving in the reign of Henry I., and was then holding, not his Saxon or Domesday estates, but cer tain Manors under Robert fitz Turold, which Manors had previ- ously been Hunnit's, or Uluiet's 1 Domesday, fo. 258, a, 1.

Peter fitz Toret, who appears first in 1160, was more probably the Grandson, or Great Grandson, than the son, of Toret. In that year a donum of .\u20ac16. 4s. Ad. was assessed on the greater Proprietors of Shropshire. Peter fitz Tured's proportion was a considerable one, viz. 7s. 3d., but it was excused by a Writ of King Henry II.1 In 1167 the Demesne-lands of Peter fitz Torette paid an amerce ment of 6s. 8^., set upon them by Alan de Nevill (then Justice of the Forest).2 Under Lawley we have noticed Peter fitz Thoret, as occurring in 1180.3 He attests Deeds of William fitz Alan (II), of Madoc, son of Gervase Goch, and very many of Walter de Duns tanville (I) . In these attestations, none of which can be accounted later than 1194, he is often followed by his sons, Philip and Bar tholomew, one or both of them, and incidentally by a third son, Walter.4 It is further probable that Gerard fitz Toret, of Evelith, was a fourth son of Peter fitz Toret. I suppose that Philip, the eldest of the above sons, died without issue, and in his father's lifetime. At all events it was the second son, \u2014 Bartholomew fitz Toret, who continued the line. Of him I have said something already,5 but must now add, first that which connects him more especially with Moreton-Toret, and afterwards that which shows him to have been interested in other and very distant counties. \u2014 His attestation of a Charter which passed in or about the year 1196 is remarkable. He is called Bartholomew de Morton, and his name is followed by that of Richard Corbet, who, after many doubts on the subject, I hesitate not to say was already his son-in-law. In the year 1214 I find Morton assessed 40s. to a King's Tallage. It is not certain that Morton-Toret was meant, but, if it was, there can be no doubt that the impost arose in the contemporary confis cation of Bartholomew de Morton's estates. A letter from the Sheriff of Shropshire, written to King John soon after Easter 1215, expressly names Bartholomew Turet as one of the only seven Salop ians who had been, and still continued to be, adverse to the King in the existing civil war. On February 25, 1216, King John orders William Earl of Pembroke to give Bartholomew Turet's land and Castle of Morton to Engeram de Pratellis, to hold during the King's 1 * 2 Rot. Pip. VI., 13 Hen.

In the last instance the name was origi nally written Peter de Torette, but the word de was cancelled and fil. subst ituted in a coeval hand. 3 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 100. 4 Supra, Vol. II., passim. 5 Supra, Vo'. u p 30g"], [643, "MORETON CORBET. 185 pleasure.1 A Writ of King Henry III., dated November 4, 1217, certifies that Bartholomew Turet had returned to the fealty and service of the Crown. Copies of this Writ were addressed to the Sheriffs of five Counties, viz. Shropshire, Cornwall, Oxfordshire, Leicestershire, and Yorkshire.2 Bartholomew de Moreton appears in his undoubted rank as a Shropshire Knight in 1229. He was deceased in 1235, and was succeeded, in Shropshire at least, by his Grandson, Richard Corbet (III), son and heir of Richard Corbet (II), by Joan, daughter and coheir of the above Bartholomew. I must now pass to a distant County, to show how some at least of Bartholomew Toret's scattered possessions had accrued. \u2014 Bertram Haget, of Helagh (Yorkshire), lived in the reign of Stephen. \u2014 With Faricius, his brother, he attests the Foundation Charter of Sallay Abbey; \u2014 a House which had its beginning in 1147, under the auspices of William de Percy.3 About the same time Ber tram Haget gave a Hermitage and some land in the wood of Helaghe to Gilbert, a monk of the French House of Marmontier. The ob ject was of course to found a Monastery. Among the Witnesses of the grant were Pharice Haget and others of the Grantor's family.4 Geoffrey Haget confirmed his father's grant, in a Charter which, from the names of its witnesses, I know to have passed between the years 1161 and 1184. The Church of St. John de Parco (after wards known as Helagh Park) was, at the date of this Charter, in existence, and Gilbert (the above-named Monk of Marmontier) was at its head. The Deed is attested by Ralph Haget, Geoffrey's brother.5 Neither Geoffrey Haget nor his brother, Ralph, left any issue. Geoffrey's heirs were his four sisters, Lucia, Alice, Gundred, and one unnamed, but who married Alan fitz Brian (of Bedale) . Gundred Haget died without issue, so that her share of her brother's estates, consisting of lands at Baynton, was divisible among her three sisters. Lucia Haget in the original partition had Wighall and Esdike. This Lucia was the wife of Peter fitz Toret and the mother of his son Bartholomew.6 It is clear that the son took his name from his maternal grandfather, Bertram Haget. Alice Haget, apparently the third sister of Geoffrey, had Helagh, and married John de Friston. Her only daughter and heir, Alice, married bers. I. II. Ralph Haget was apparently a Monk. He became Abbot of Fountains in 1190, and was deceased in 1203. 1 Rot. Patent, p. 166. * Rot. Claus. I. 373. 3 Monasticon, Vol. V. 512.

Jordan de St. Mary; and a Charter, which the said Jordan and Alice expedited jointly to Helagh- Park Priory, has the attestation of Bartholomew Thuret.1 This Charter undoubtedly passed in or about the year 1219. We now return to \u2014 Bartholomew Toret, as our principal subject. If he had suc ceeded his father before 1196 it is indirectly evident that he had succeeded his mother before 1205. In that year he fined no less a sum than 20 merks in composition of King John's sixth scutage. The debt was assessed and paid in Shropshire in that and the fol lowing year ; but Bartholomew Toret had no Tenancy in Shropshire which could have subjected him to such a liability. I must conclude that it was his mother's inheritance which made him thus important. There are three Counties besides Shropshire and Yorkshire2 in which I have endeavoured to trace the origin and destination of Bartholomew Toret's interests. I have had very partial success. His estate in Leicestershire, from whomsoever derived, was probably that estate at Houghton which we find afterwards in Corbet of Moreton.3 What he had in Oxfordshire I cannot discover. In Cornwall he held one of those lesser Fees which were technically known as \"Fees of Moretain.\" The only allusion to this tenure, which I can find, places it in Streton. It was assessed in the year 1235 to the Aid on marriage of the King's sister, and the Roll clearly shows that Bartholomew Toret was deceased at the time, for the estate is described as \" unum feodum minutum quod suit Bartholomei Toret in Streton.\"4 It was perhaps his feudal connec tion with Dunstanvill which introduced Bartholomew Toret to this distant county. I must now correct some former mistakes,6 and state that it was \u2014 Richard Corbet (II) of Wattlesborough, who married Joan, daughter, and, in her issue, coheir of Bartholomew Toret. The said Richard is he who occurs from 1195 to 1217, and he was probably sou of the Richard Corbet of 1180. He seems to have died before 1 Monasticon, VI. 439, Rum. V. 4 Testa de Nevill, p. 201. On page 187 of the same Record Bertram fitz Thorold is entered as holding a knight's-fee in Stranton (apparently in Devonshire). Stranton can hardly be identical with Streton (iu the text) ; but the entry con cerning Stranton is very inconclusive, both as to the County and the Fief which pur port to be under notice. 2 Bertram Thoret had a sister, Lucia, who appears to have shared largely in his Yorkshire estates (MS. Cotton. Vespas. A. IV. fos. 19, 20, 21, 29). She was de ceased in 1254, and was then represented by her son and heir, Ranulf de Albo Mo nasterio. In 1284 Reginald de Albo Mo nasterio was head of this family. 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 103, note 14. \u2022 Vol. II, p. 307; Vol. VII. p. 102."], [645, "187 MORETON CORBET. his father-in-law, Bartholomew Toret, and it was probably his son and Bartholomew's grandson who, as \" Richard, son of Richard Corbet,\" granted to Buildwas between 1217 and 1225.1 In fact, we have had good proof that the wife of\u2014 Richard Corbet (III), and the mother of Robert Corbet, was not a Toret, but a Lady named Petronilla, who is said to have brought with her estates at Booley and Edgbolton.3 Of Robert Corbet, I have some further particulars not as yet given. On March 1, 1254, Giles de Erdinton sues him for disseiz in, viz. for depriving the said Giles of common pasture in Morton aud Preston. A second Writ on the same business issued on July 30, 1255. Giles de Erdinton was Lord of Shawbury, Besford, and part of Preston Brockhurst. At the Inquest of Bradford Hundred, taken in 1255, Robert Corbet appears as Lord of Morton. It contained one geldable hide (the Domesday estimate). It consisted of half a knight's-fee (in cluding Preston, I think) of the Fief of John de Chetewynd. It paid Ad. yearly for stretward, but nothing apparently for motfee, and it did suit every three weeks to the Lesser Hundred-Court.3 At the Assizes of January 1256 Robert Corbet officiated as a Juror for Bradford Hundred. His suit with Giles de Erdinton was tried. Giles claimed the right of common, above alluded to, in respect of his tenure at Besford. It was a right throughout 40 acres of moorland in Morton and Preston. Corbet maintained that Giles and his ancestors had had no such right, except on payment of certain acknowledgments in the shape of corn and poultry ;4 but Erdinton asserted a free right,5 and Corbet was convicted of the disseizin. Robert Corbet's tenure of Morton cum membris, as exhibited in the Bradford Tenure-Rolls of 1284-5, has been quoted under Preston Brockhurst.6 Robert Corbet has not yet been noticed as Sheriff of Shropshire. He served that office for the quarter ending Michaelmas 1288 and for the year ending Michaelmas 1289. On the Assize Roll of 1292 he is mentioned as one of those Sheriffs who had served since 1272, and were still living. On this Assize- Roll Moreton Corbet is at length described by that name. Robert Corbet's exercise of Free- Warren there, was presented by the Bradford Jurors, as was his like privilege in Preston Toret, presented by the Pimhill Jurors.

A Patent of December 4, 1295, appoints Sir Robert Corbet and Master Adam Gest,2 Clerk, to be Assessors and Collectors of the eleventh and seventh in the County of Salop. The Inquest on Robert Corbet's death sat at Moreton on Sunday, January 15, 1301. The passage about Moreton itself is sadly defaced. It was, with its members, held by knight's-service under John de Chetwynd. John de Wrothe, who had held some parcel of the Manor under Robert Corbet, had enfeoffed the said Robert and his wife Matilda, con jointly, in the said parcel.3 I do not find that Matilda retained the same till her decease. I pass over Thomas Corbet,4 son and heir of Robert, to \u2014 Robert Corbet (II), son and heir of Thomas. He was born Dec. 25, 1304, and was consequently under 12 years of age when the Nomina Villarum of 1316 marks him as Lord of the Vill of Moreton Corbet. In 1326 he was still without the degree of knight hood. His public life was nearly coextensive with the long reign of the third Edward, for he died on Dec. 3, 1375. Pursuant to a Writ of Nov. 26, 1355, an Inquest reported that Robert Corbet's wish to have vieiv of frank-pledge in Moreton Corbet would only injure the Crown to the extent of about 3s. per annum, which was the average amount of amercements incurred at the Sheriff's two Tourns by Corbet's men, for breaches of the assize of bread and beer, for bloodshed, homsoken, and forestall.5 This Robert Corbet purchased Shawbury from Giles de Erdinton, but without that Royal License which was necessary to the transfer of a tenure in capite. On Oct. 30, 1359, he had petitioned the Crown to excuse this act, and to allow him to enfeoff Hugh, Vicar of Shawbury, and William, Parson of Upton, iu the same, who, being seized, were to settle the Manor on Robert Corbet, Elizabeth his wife, and their heirs. The matter was referred to an Inquest ad quod damnum, which reported the Manor to be held by half a knight's-fee, and to be worth \u00a33. 6s. 8d. per annum, and not more, seeing that it had already, by Royal License, been dismembered of several tenants.6 1 Vide supra.

An Inquest, held on May 25, 1369, found Shawbury to be held in capite for a sixth of a knight's-fee, and to be worth 100s. per an num, and that it would not damage the Crown if Robert Corbet, of Morton, and Elizabeth, his wife, were to convey the same to Thomas Gery, Vicar of Morton, and Thomas Lee, of Sondbache, who were to entail the same, as we shall presently see it was entailed. The Inquest found, moreover, that Moreton Toret and Boleye would remain to Robert Corbet, and that Moreton was held of John de Chetewynd's heir by knight' s-service, and was worth \u00a310 per annum, and that Boleye was held in socage of the Abbot of Salop, and was worth 40s. per annum.1 In October 1371 a Fine was levied, whereby Thomas Gery, Vicar of Morton, and Thomas de Lee, of Southbache, settle Shawbury Manor on Sir Robert Corbet and Elizabeth, his wife, for the longest of their lives, with remainder to Fulk, their son, and his heirs male, with remainder to Roger, Fulk's brother, and his heirs male, with remainder to the right heirs of Sir Robert. This Fine was levied by Precept of the King. But the Inquest on Robert Corbet's death (presently to be cited) will best show the extraordinary manner in which he settled his es tates. I should premise that he had three sons, Thomas, Fulk, and Roger. All three are said to have been the sons of his wife Eli zabeth, but indeed, were there not some proof of that fact, I should have supposed that Thomas (certainly the eldest son) was by a pre vious marriage. Thomas died long before his Father, leaving an only daughter, Elizabeth, born about 1357, and married, in or be fore 1375, to Sir John de Ipstones. It was evidently the object of Sir Robert and Elizabeth Corbet to disinherit this Elizabeth, Robert's granddaughter and right heir. The Inquest, ordered December 11, 1375, and taken January 9, 1376, gives the said Elizabeth as Robert Corbet's heir, but also gives a list of his estates and their entails, which shows to how little she can have succeeded.

He died seized of nothing in-fee ,- nor had the entails recited in the last Inquest operated in his favour in any ap parent case except that of the Manor of Shawbury. But entails, not recited in the last Inquest, had caused him to die seized of Moreton Corbet, Harpcote, Rowton, and Amaston; and these, it seems, were entailed on him and his heirs male, with remainder to his brother Roger and the heirs of Roger's body. As to Wattles borough Manor, Heye Manor, Bredeshull Manor, Hemme Manor (and with it the vill of Hinnington), Kynnerton vill, Stirchley, and Habberley, these Fulk Corbet is now explained to have held, con jointly with Elizabeth, his surviving wife ; \u2014 with remainder to the bodily heirs of himself and the said Elizabeth ; \u2014 with remainder to Roger, Fulk's brother, and the heirs of his body, with remainder to the right heirs of Robert Corbet (Fulk's Father). This, though partly inconsistent with the details of the former Inquest, is most probably correct ; for there can be no doubt that the Manors, etc., last named, descended to Elizabeth, Fulk's only child and heir, who was born about 1375, was aged \" 7 years and upwards\" at her father's death, and who afterwards married John, Lord of Mowddy, and was ancestress, through the De Burghs, of the four Shropshire families of Newport, Leighton, Lingen, and Mytton. I have spoken of Fulk Corbet, only in respect of estates settled on him by his Father. I forbear to enter on the intricate negotia tions which he and his brother Roger had with Robert de Harley and his wife Joan concerning great estates to which the Brothers had no hereditary pretensions whatever. The subject, although carrying me far later than I wish to descend, must recur again under Wentnor. Suffice it here to say that the said Joan was a sister of Fulk and Roger Corbet, and that her husband, Robert de Harley, appears to have been a mere simpleton.' It is obvious in respect of Moreton Corbet, that the entail, set tled by the Fine of 1363, and recognized on Fulk Corbet's death, without issue male, must have conveyed that estate to his brother Roger and his lineal heirs. The lineal descendant and representa tive of the said Roger Corbet is at this day seized of Moreton Corbet. I should say a word here about EHzabeth, granddaughter and 1 He was surnamed fatuus.

She was still Hving when, on March 10, 1394, the King's Writ of Diem clausit announced the death of Sir John de Ipstones, her husband. Sir John died seized, in her right, of the Manor of Besford, and of 3 messuages and 3 bovates in Shawbury, all which were held in capite ; \u2014 also of the Manor of Bausley, held under Fulk fitz Warin, then in minority.1 This is much what we should have expected from the settlements, cited under the Inquest of January 1376. I think that subsequently all these estates were obtained from the heirs of Ipstones, by the heirs of one or olher of the two brothers, Fulk or Roger Corbet. In conclusion, I should say something about Shawbury Manor (as distinct from the 3 messuages and 3 bovates last mentioned). The remainders specified in the Fine of October 1371, brought it (on Fulk Corbet's death without issue male) to the heirs male of his brother Roger. Robert Corbet (III), son and heir of the said Roger, settled it on himself, his wife Margaret, and the heirs of their bodies, with remainder to his own right heirs. A Writ of February 6, 1439, announces the death of the said Margaret, then widow of Robert Corbet. An Inquest held at Bridgnorth on Nov. 12, 1439, found that the said Margaret had died seized in fee-tail of Shawbury Manor, aud with remainder, as last specified. Roger Corbet (II), son and heir of the said Margaret and of Robert Cor bet, was the heir therefore of Shawbury Manor, and was now 24 years of age and over.2 MORETON CORBET CHURCH. The earlier history of this Church, when it was called only a Chapel, and when its subjection to Shawbury Church was again and again the subject of Episcopal manifestoes, has been already given.3 It is not quite clear that Moreton was one of those Chapels which, with cemeteries attached, were consecrated by Bishop Clinton (1130-1148) ; but it is clear that Moreton Church, with its Ceme tery, existed in his time, that he recognized its subjection to Shaw bury, and decreed that it should be assessed to Episcopal dues in the ratio of a Chapel.4 Bishop Peche, we have further seen, exempted Moreton Chapel altogether from Episcopal Dues, and though he described it as in the \" fee of Teter fitz Toret,\" he maintained the supremacy of Shawbury Church, and therefore of the Canons of Haughmond, over the Chapel.

This reversal of their usual policy in respect of Chapelries may be attributed to the continued vigilance of the Manorial Lords. It often happened that though a Layman had founded and endowed a Chapelry, his Successors allowed themselves to be cajoled by Mon astic Impropriators, and gave up both the services and the emolu ments due to the Chapel. In neither the Valor of 1291, nor the Inquisition of 1341, are the Chapel and Parish of Moreton Corbet treated as distinct from Shawbury.

I repeat that Normannus Venator was probably ancestor of the Pichfords ; that Engelard de Stretton was a Pichford, and obtained a great ascendency in the estates of the elder line ; and that De Burgh was heir general to Engelard de Stretton. This will explain those several allusions to the Sei gneuralty of Coolmere, which must needs be made, while speaking of the Tenancy. I have adverted, under Harnage, to the singular fact that Hugh de Lacy (afterwards Lord of Ludlow and Ewyas) was in the year 1155 styled \"of Colemere.\"3 I suppose him to have been enfeoffed here, during the period of his adversity, by a Pichford or by Enge lard de Stretton. And as Hugh de Lacy, when he became a great man, surrendered Harnage to his brother, Almaric, so I think did he surrender Coolmere to that William de Wootton whom we know to have been his Tenant at Wootton (near Stanton Lacy), and at Onibury, and at Walton.4 Between the Manors of Coolmere and Broom there was a Mill, sometimes called the Mill of Coolmere, and sometimes the Mill of Broom. It was really in Broom, for 1 Domesday, fo. 259, a, 2. 3 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 73, 74. 4 Supra, Vol. V. pp. 15, 56. - Supra, Vol. IX. pp. 361, 362."], [657, "COOLMERE. 195 before the year 1172 Engelard de Stretton (as Lord of Broom) gave it to Haughmond Abbey.

It further appears that William de Wudeton's own Deed was necessary to secure the above Mill to the Abbey. He \"concedes and gives the Mill of Brome, with half a virgate of land, and with a toft on which Thomas, son-in-law of William Grinels hull, dwelt.

The Canons may, moreover, rebuild the Mill which they had possessed from ancient time, in any more convenient place between the present stank and the Grantor's Great Mere of Colemere, with fosses and watercourse from the said Mill down to the said Mere.

The Manor owed suit to County and Hundred; and paid \\6d. for stretward and motfee.\"2 The Jurors further represented that \"for a whole year Robert de Lacy had withdrawn the said suits.\" He 1 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit.

On July 31, 1255, King Henry III., addressing Philip Lovel, his Treasurer, and Nicholas de Haudlou, informs them that \" his faithful and beloved Robert de Lacy had complained of the Royal Bailiff at Ellesmere, for exacting from the said Robert other customs aud services than he and his ancestors had been used to perform for their Manor of Culemere.\" The Justiciars are there- fore ordered by the King, that \" as soon as they reach those parts, for the purpose of taking the Inquisitions and Extents, already en joined upon them, they inquire fully into this matter, and, on their return to Court, acquaint the King with the result ; \u2014 that the King may cause justice to be done to De Lacy.\" The return to the above writ is necessarily much fuller than the brief sentence which appears in the Hundred-Roll; but unfortu nately the slip of parchment containing the return has been cut iu two, and one half is missing. The proceedings of the Justiciars are however partly apparent. They empanelled a Jury of 42 persons, viz. 12 freeholders from each of the Hundreds of Pimhill, Ford, and Condover, and six knights. The finding of this Jury, in relation to Robert de Lacy's obligation to do any suit at Ellesmere, appears to have been that he was not so bound, for that Colemere was held by knight's-service under Bertram de Burgh, who held of the fee of Albrithon (i. e. under De Pichford). Neither, it seems, was De Lacy customarily bound to victual certain persons ; \u2014 probably the Castle-guards of Ellesmere. Also De Lacy's complaint, that \" the King's Bailiff had seized his boat and his nets in the Mere of Culemere,\" seems to have been recognized as well founded. He was accustomed apparently to use such engines at all times of the vear, and a great portion of his estate consisted of the said Mere.1 In the Civil wars of 1264-5 Robert de Lacy's loyalty did not pass unquestioned. He was subsequently involved in some difficul ties, though he managed to escape forfeiture. He seems to have consigned Coolmere to Peter de Montfort, who in turn sold it to Hamo le Strange, one of the greatest Royalists of the period. The Forest Roll (at Westminster).

In Easter Term, 1271, \" Amicia, widow of Robert de Lacy, receded from a Writ de in gressu which she had brought against Hamo le Strange concerning the Manor of Culemere, excepting a messuage and half-virgate.\" I suppose that Amicia, being herself heiress of Coolmere, had ques tioned the act of her late husband in alienating it, but had accepted some compromise of her claim. Within three years of this, Hamo le Strange died, having first enfeoffed his brother Boger in Elles mere, Coolmere, and Welch Hampton. His right to do this as re garded Ellesmere was doubtful; and so Adam de Chetwynd, Es cheator for Cheshire, seized all three Manors in manu Regis. On this Roger le Strange petitioned the King (Edward I.), alleging Henry III.'s grant of Ellesmere to Hamo le Strange, the subse quent purchase of Coolmere and Hampton by the said Hamo, and the ultimate feoffment of the Petitioner. The King, by a Writ dated March 3, 1274, directed due inquiry to be made. The In quest, which followed, found that Henry III. had enfeoffed Hamo le Strange in both Ellesmere and (Church) Stretton till 100 librates of land could be provided elsewhere, that Hamo then purchased the fee of Coolmere and Henton of Sir Peter de Montfort, and enfeoffed his brother Roger in those two Manors as well as in Ellesmere ; aud that Roger had been in seizin of all three, till the Escheator ejected him. Lastly the Jurors said that Coolmere was of the fee of Bartholomew de Burgh, and Henton of the fee of John fitz Alan.1 On June 7, 1276, a Fine was levied at Westminster, whereby Roger le Strange (Deforciant) surrendered the Manors of Colmere and Hampton to King Edward I. (Plaintiff). The King, in turn, conceded those two Manors, as well as the Castle and Hundred of Ellesmere, to Roger le Strange, for Hfe only, with remainder to the King and his heirs. The Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 says that \" Roger le Strange holds the Vill of Culmer under Bartholomew de Burgo by service of one-third of a knight's-fee in wartime.\" I have traced elsewhere the further career of Roger le Strange.2 In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, the Queen of England stands as Lady of the Vill of Culmere Hampton. i Inquis. 1 Edw.

Pimhill Hundred (the usual representative of Bascherch Hundred) contains nothing which can be taken to tally in name with Estone and Cheneltone. The mention of Elnod, as Saxon Lord of Estone, is without any associations. The Pichfords, everywhere else the successors of Norman Venator, are not found with any such Manors as Estone and Cheneltone in aftertimes, whether we look to Pimhill Hundred or to any other part of Shropshire. As to Fulcher, the Domesday tenant of Estone, he may have been the same Fulcher as he who held Easthope and Eaton (Mascott) under Rainald Vice comes ; but this leads down to nothing, for that Fulcher does not appear to have had hereditary successors.2 It is profitless to say more on such a question. We must dismiss Estone and Cheneltone as two localities which, in the early vicissitudes of Border history, were expunged from the map of Shropshire and from the memory of man. i^lacjjefcevie* This stands first of the Manors which Domesday assigns to Roger Venator. \u2014 Rogerius Venator tenet, de Rogerio Comite, Slacheberie.

It is added to this notice that \" the heir was under age and in the King's custody.\"3 I suppose that Wil liam de Hochton, alias de Slachbury, was the heir in question, or the deceased father of the said heir : and that John de Grey, now Custos of Ellesmere, not only claimed Slachbury as a member of Ellesmere, but had, as a correlative, taken custody of the heir of Slachbury as a ward of the Crown. Now, in any case, and even if Slachbury was a member of Ellesmere, this seizure of a wardship will have been derogatory to the rights of Thomas de Constantine, the Mesne-lord. I further think that Slachbury was not, as yet at least, a member of Ellesmere, and that Thomas de Constantine must have held it under Roger Venator's heirs, the Barons of Pul verbatch. Observations, already made under Pulverbatch and under Haughton (near Haughmond) , give to this idea a fair claim on our acceptance.* After the year 1255 we hear no more of Slach bury. The attempt to annex it to Ellesmere, near which it evi dently stood, was probably successful in the end. It lost not only its existence as an independent Manor, but, as far as I can make out its name ; for none of the later members of Ellesmere were known by any similar appellation. 4 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 196 ; Vol. VIII. p. 285. 1 Domesday, fo. 259, a, 2. 8 \u2022 3 Rot.

Inde litigant homines Co mitis.1 So the Domesday Commissioners, owing to a pending Lawsuit among Earl Roger's Vassals, could not specify the status of Bruma ; and, while they classed it in Roger Venator's Fief, they noted its connection with Albert's Manor of Welch Hampton. There can be no doubt that Brome is now represented by Broom Farm, a place in the township of Tetchill, and about two miles south-west of Elles merQ. We should expect to find it in the 13th century, held either by the Rosshalls, as descended from Albert, or by the Barons of Pulverbatch, as descended from Roger Venator. But Domesday does not tell us specifically who the Litigants of 1085 were. That is a matter of which we must judge by results. Doubtless then one of the Litigants was Norman Venator, and doubtless also he was the successful one. Brome, in short, descended to his heirs, the Pichfords, and was held under the Pichfords by that scion of their House, whom we have so often heard of as Engelard de Stretton. Richard de Pichford, elder brother of this Engelard, gave Brome to Haghmon Abbey. This (as I have explained elsewhere) was before the year 1157. The gift was registered and confirmed by Engelard (the surviving brother of Richard de Pichford, and the guardian of his heir) in terms which suggest that Engelard had a collateral in terest in the estate. His Charter runs as follows : \u2014 \" Omnibus Sanct\u00e6 Dei Ecclesi\u00e6 filiis, tarn futuris quam presentibus, Engelardus de Strettonia salutem.

Brome juxta Elesmere, with its appurtenances. Pope Alexander III., in his Bull of May 14, 1172, confirms to the Abbey ex dono Engelardi de Stretton, Brome, et sedem molendini in eodem feodo.2 Of the Abbot of Haughmond's subsequent possession of Brome we have the foUowing evidences : \u2014 About the year 1313 Thomas de Gesenok disseized him of the estate, but at the Assizes held at Ludlow in January 1319 the Abbot recovered it by exhibiting Enge lard de Stretton's Charter and a Confirmation thereof by Henry II. In 1327 the Abbot demises his Grange of Brome to Richard Orayle, of Newton, near Ellesmere, for life; rent, 30s. In 1336 (as we have seen) the Abbot had license to exchange Brome and other lands near EUesmere for lands at Haughton (near Haughmond) and at Edgbold.3 It will appear under Newton that the Abbot retained certain lands near Ellesmere till the Dissolution. jfelton Butler.

In the Liber Niger, or Feodary of 1165, Hamo fitz Buteler is the recorded Tenant of a knight's-fee under Herbert de Castellis,1 Helgot's grand son. This Hamo fitz Butiler was doubtless identical with Hamo de Felton, who appears on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1176, as having mortgaged his land for Ils. to one Orneus, a Priest. The Priest, it seems, had refused to receive the sum advanced, when repayment was offered ; so the King's Justices ordered it to be paid to the Sheriff of Shropshire, who handed it over to the Royal Exchequer.2 In 1180 the King's Justices amerced the vill of Felton half a merk, because it had neglected to investigate a case of homicide (quia non fecit seetam de morte occisi). The next Butler of Felton whom I can name was John, son of Hamo, living apparently about the years 1205-1230.

Of such a dedication I have nothing to say in the way of explana tion. What concerns us more is, that John Butler was a Bene factor of the said Hospital. I give an abstract of his Charters thereto, premising that the Chartulary from which they are taken3 is by no means an accurate transcript of the Deeds which it affects to perpetuate. \u2014 \" Johannes Buteler filius Hamonis Butiler dedi in perpetuam elemosynam Deo et Sanct\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 de Rocherio de Nesse, et fratribus ibidem servientibus xn acras terr\u00e6, vidz. ix acras quas Ricardus Faber et Willielmus frater ejus tenuerunt, vidz. juxta viam qu\u00e6 descendit de Brornhull4 versus Vynelecot,5 et in acras quas Hugo Plumarius et Rogerus filius Ricardi Brun tenuerunt prope ix acras predictas, &c. \u2014 pro anima mea, \u2014 et anima Yllari\u00e6 uxoris me\u00e6.

The Feodaries of 1240 give Hamo le Botiler as holding a Knight's-fee in Felton, under Thomas Mauduit.3 In 1250 I find Hamo le But iler amerced half a merk pro salso clamore, and 20s. for some false presentment. In 1255 he was one of the Jurors who made Inquest of PimhiU Hundred, and reported that he himself held 3 virgates in Felton, of the Fee of William Mauduit, doing knight's-service for 40 days at Montgomery in wartime. He did suit to County aud Hundred, but paid neither motfee nor stretivard? I think that Felton must have been the earliest Holgate Fee which was thus charged with Castle-Guard at Montgomery. Afterwards the whole Barony was so charged. At the Assizes of 1256 Hamo le Botyler appeared as a Juror for Pimhill Hundred ; but was pronounced in misericordid, with eight other persons of knightly rank who had disobeyed an order of the Justices as to making some perambulation.4 At the Assizes of September 1272, and when now the Templars 3 Rot.

The Master of the Templars alleged that Achelard, a preceding Master, had been seized of the service of a knight's-fee, also of 40s. scutage (when a scutage was levied at that rate per fee), also of suit every three weeks to the Court of Castle Holgate. Hamo le Botyler, on the other hand, maintained that he only owed two suits yearly to Holgate, and no more knight's-service than 40 days' castle-guard at Montgomery at his own charges. He demanded trial by Grand Assize. The re sult was that he was acquitted of the suit every three weeks to Holgate, but was found liable, not only to the services which he acknowledged, but to the full service of a knights'-fee as well ; that is, I presume, for scutages, and in excercitu. Each party to the Cause was in misericordid. Hamo le Botiler was Foreman of the Pimhill Jurors at the In quest of 1274. He seems to have held something under the Stranges of Great Ness, and in 1276 was a Juror on the Inquest taken after the death of John le Strange (IV). On January 20, 1278, a Fine was levied, whereby Hamo de Felton Botiler (Impedient) grants to his younger son, William, a messuage, 24 acres, and half a vir gate, in Kinge's-Ness and Felton Botyler; \u2014 to hold to WiUiam and his heirs, paying 20s. rent to his father whUe living, and a rose rent to his Father's heirs after his Father's death ; and discharging all capital services. The Master of the English Templars opposed his claim to this Fine. On the same day Hamo le Botyler settled on his younger son, John, estates at Aston near Twyford, Stanwardine in-the-Field, and Winnesbury, but was here also opposed by the Master of the Templars. The PimhUl Tenure-Roll of 1279, with much error both as to facts and words, says that \"Felton Butler is held of Hamond Butler, of the Fee of William Madocke (Mauduit was meant) of Cas tle-Holegod, by service of one knight at Montgomery in wartime.\" By a Fine of July 1, 1283, Hamo le Botyler (Deforciant) gives to William, his son (Plaintiff), 6 messuages, 4 bovates, 2| virgates, and 40 acres of land in Felton Botyler, Stanwordyn of-te-Feld, Aston-juxta-Twyford, and Wynesbury, in the Valley of Montgo mery ; to hold to William and his heirs, paying 40s. rent to Hamo for his life, and one Rose afterwards to Hamo's heirs, and dis charging all capital services. A Sore-hawk was the ostensible con sideration for this grant."], [667, "205 SLEAP MAGNA. Hamo le Botyller's decease was announced by a Writ of Diem Clausit, dated January 11th, 1290. John, now his eldest son and heir, was of full age, and was already entitled to estates at Wyns bury, &c, as settled by the Fine of 1278.1 John le Botyler appears on Juries, at Bicton and Besford, in January aud December 1291. I shaU also show (under Stanwardine-in-campo) that he was living in October 1292. However he seems to have died soon afterwards, and to have been succeeded either by a son, William, or by^his younger brother of that name. A Feodary, drawm up in May 1295, and enumerating the estates of Philip Burnel, late Lord of Holgate, reports the Hamlet of Fel ton as held by William le Botiler, under the late Baron, and by service of one knight. The tenancy was valued at \u00a35. 3s. ld. per annum.2 \" Thomas le Botiler of Feltone \" attests a Ness Deed in 1322. i^Ieap jHacjna* I have already given my reasons3 for supposing the following Manor of William Pantulf to have been in Bascherch Hundred, rather than in Culvestan, to which the letter of Domesday would assign it. \u2014 Isdem Willelmus tenet Eslepe.

We have already seen that Robert de Beslow held Beslow at or about this time, under the Barons of Wem.1 At the Assizes of 1256, Reginald de Slepe sued Roger fitz Wil liam, Thomas le Provost of Nueton, Roger le Waleys of Burwelton, Richard fitz Hugh of Slepe, Hugh fitz Eddid of Iorthon (Yorton), and eighteen others, for disseizing him of common-right in 200 acres at Byllemers (Bilmarsh) . The defendants were men of John le Strange, aud claimed nothing save by his pleasure. They were dismissed, and the Plaintiff took nothing. Roger de Slepe occurs on a local Jury in 1274, but he may have been of Little Sleap. The Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279, says merely that \" Slepe Magna is held of Ranulf Butler (then Baron of Wem) by service of one Montar for 15 days at the Castle of Weme.\" After this, Sleap Magna becomes more or less involved with Wem. Being in the Parish of Wem, it is now reputed to be in the Hundred of Bradford- North, while Parva Sleap, being in the Parish of Middle, still re mains in Pimhill Hundred. Thus the two may be still distinguished by position, though the distinctive names of Sleap Magna and Sleap Parva have ceased to be used. i^tttiteld).

If, however, the name be identical with Alsi or Elsi,3 we should look for any tenure of Asci's, in South, rather than in North, Shropshire.

Instead of Jagdon appearing afterwards as a Tenure-in-capite, it appears as a member of Fitz Alan's Fief, but held by a kind of Serjeantry. Simon, son of William de Jagdon, occurs in 1204 ; Roger, Simon's son, from about 1215 to 1230. This Roger (as we have already seen) bartered his estate at Jagdon, for land at Edgebold, with Vi vian de Roshall, to whom also he afterwards sold what he had thus obtained in Edgebold.3 We have further seen that Roger de Jagdon's mother, Emma, remarried after Simon's death, to WiUiam Banastre, of Hadnall, whom she also survived. It was early in the 13th century, and before Roger de Jagedon alienated Jagedon to Vivian de Roshall, that he gave to Haghmon Abbey a messuage and a croft of 3 acres in Jagedon, held by Robert fitz Ingrit.

The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 gives Vivian de Roshall's son in full possession. \" Thomas de Roshal holds one carucate of land in Jagedon, and it is of the Fee of John fitz Alan. He (Thomas) pays, in time of war, to John fitz Alan, one vessel full of potherbs, with three dishes of meat.\"5 3 Supra, Vol. IX. p. 324. 1 A similar mistake is perhaps made in the case of Yarton -\u2014printed Lartune in stead oi lar tune (supra, p. 162). 4 Haughmond Charty., Til.

Beaton, Domesday notices this Manor in the following terms. \u2014 \" Anschitil tenet Letone de Comite. Hunni tenuit et liber homo suit. Ibi i hida geldabilis. Terra est n carrucis.

Gilbert de Leton, one of this family, has been seen attesting a Hadnall Deed, before the year 1201. 5 At the Assizes of October 1203, we have \u2014 Adam de Leton essoigning his attendance at the common summons. He also appears in 1211 as holding his land by service of doing ward at Shrewsbury Castle with his Batista. He was to serve 8 days at his own charges, but if he stayed there longer, it was to be at the King's expense.6 To this Adam succeeded \u2014 Roger de Leton, his son, who is found attesting a local Deed about 1240-50.

He was still to discharge this service, and further to pay AOd. yearly to the Crown, for 5 bovates, alienated from his Serjeantry, and now held under him by one William fitz Warin.1 The Pipe-Roll of 1250 charges him (the said Roger) with 3i years' arrears of this debt. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 makes Leeton to be one hide of land, but represents Roger de Leeton's Serjeantry to be commuted for an annual rent of AOd., payable to the King's Escheator. Roger de Leeton and William fitz Warin of Leeton were two of the Jurors who made this return. Roger de Leeton owed suit to County and Hundred, and paid 8c?. yearly for stretward and motfee.2 Another part of this return contains a difficulty. The Record says that \" Nicholas de Hasting' holds in the same (Leeton) one hide of land, not geldable ;3 and it is of the fee of William Panton, of Cublesdon. It is held by payment of half a merk annual rent, and the Tenant has a Franchise, as he says, through the Abbot of Salop, but the Jury are ignorant of his warrantry.\" As this tenure had really nothing to do with the Domesday Leaton, I leave it to a subsequent page. Roger de Leton was a Juror for PimhUl Hundred at the Assizes of 1256, and sat on a Hodnet Inquest in September 1257. The King's Writ announcing his death bears date November 25, 1262. The Inquest which foUowed, found him to have died seized of 4 virgates in Leeton, held by service of AOd. per annum.3 Adam, his son and heir, was now 32 years of age.4 PetronUla, Roger de Leeton's widow, married Elyas de Stokes, of whom we have heard before.5 This was without the King's li cense ; but it seems that the Escheator, Master Richard de Clifford, hushed the matter up for a bribe of 20s.6 Adam de Leyton (II) sat as a Juror for Pimhill Hundred at the Assizes of October 1272. He was deceased before January 6, 1273, when John fitz Aer, as Escheator, seized his land (4 bovates at Letone) and held it till June 24 following.7 The Hundred-Roll of November 1274 records how an extortionate Officer, Stephen de Bitterley, had exacted 6s.

Nor indeed can I find exact evi dence as to the next Tenant of this Serjeantry. In May 1274 one Ivo de Letone appears on a local Jury, but I do not think him to have been Lord of Leaton. Richard de Leeton, probably successor to Adam (II), had a son and heir, Roger, born about Michaelmas 1280. In January and December 1291 this Richard appears on Juries at Bicton and Bes ford. He also occurs as Witness of a Hadnall Deed in July 1293. On November 17, 1308, King Edward II.'s Writ of Diem clausit announces the decease of Richard de Leton. An Inquest was held at Preston (probably Preston Gubbalds) in January following. The Serjeantry under which he had held was singularly changed. His tenure was by 40 days' ward at Shrewsbury Castle, during which period he was to provide one man with a bow and three shafts (pilettis), unfeathered, in event of war ; and, after the 40 days ended, the man was to shoot his shafts into three quarters of the said Castle, and to depart, unless the King wished to detain him. There was an arrentation of AOd. on this Serjeantry. The arable land held by the deceased was worth 10s. per annum ; a Mill pro duced 6s. 8d. Roger, his son and heir, was 28 years of age at Michaelmas 1308.3 Roger de Leton (II) occurs on various occasions as a Witness or Juror, and from 1310 to 1340. An Inquest was held at Shrews bury on Nov. 12, 1347, touching a settlement which he proposed to make of his estate, viz. \" half of the Manor of Leton-juxta-Muri den.\" He wished to enfeoff Roger Don and Roger de Ercalwe, Chaplains, as Trustees, who were in turn to settle it upon himself for life, with remainder to William Huse and Cecily his wife, and the heirs of their bodies, with further remainder to the right heirs of Roger de Leton. The Inquest found the proposal to be non injurious to the Crown. The said moiety of Leton was held in capite for a rent of 40c?. per annum and was worth 20s. more. The settle ment was allowed to be made for a Fine of 40s. paid by the said Roger.3 For some reason or other, Roger de Leton changed his 1 Rot. Hundred. II. 105, 106. - Inquis. 2 Edw.

Roger de Leeton was deceased on Oct. ] 8, 1353. He died seized, in fee-tail, of a moiety of Leeton, as settled by the license of 1350. His right heir (thus disinherited) was Richard, son of William de Burleton, aged 22 years at Michaelmas 1353.1 I cannot say how any of these parties were related to Roger de Leeton. Leaton in Albrighton. Besides the Domesday Manor of Le tone, there was a hide of land which was usually accounted a moiety of Leaton, and went by the name of Leaton, but which was origi nally, as I think, a member of the Domesday Manor of Albrighton. The Seigneury of this estate was in the Monks of Shrewsbury, but they seem to have made an ancient feoffment thereof to some of the Pantulfs, so that early in the 13th century the Pantulfs of Cubles don were accounted Lords of this part of Leaton. Hence we find that a Deed, which related to the neighbouring Manor of Great Berwick, and which passed about the year 1226, has the attestations of two brothers, William and Norman Pantulf.3 Now this WilHam Pantulf was of Cublesdon, and was also, I think, Lord of the moiety of Leaton, now under notice. From what has been said on a former page,3 we may assume that in 1255, Nicholas de Hastings held the above hide in Leaton, under the heir of Pantulf of Cublesdon, who held under Shrewsbury Abbey by a mere quit-rent of 6s. 8c?. At the Assizes of January 1256, Adam, son of William de Lertton, failed to prosecute a suit of mort d'ancestre, which he had arraigned against Nicholas de Hasting and (Emilina ?) his wife, for 6 mes suages and 3 virgates in Letton. His Sureties de prosequendo were Thomas, son of Richard de Letton, and Robert Slinge.4 On Nov. 3, 1292, Reginald fitz William, of Stanwardine, and Juliana his wife (Plaintiffs) quitclaim, for 8 merks, all their right in a half-virgate in Leton.

On Nov. 25, 1292, another Fine was levied, whereby Emeline, widow of Nicholas de Hastinges, (Plaintiff) quitclaimed, for J20, to Richard Pride (Tenant), all her right to a messuage and carucate of land in Leton. Richard Pride, thus enfeoffed in Leton, appears to have been succeeded by a second Roger Pride, whose widow, Agnes, remarried with William de Bi riton, but whose heirs were Henry de Bromleye and his wife Agnes.

Under his auspices the respective Ancestors of Fitz Alan and Fitz Warin were settled in Shropshire. In his reign many Immigrants from Brittany and Maine may be presumed to have come to England, and, among them, several members of the family of De Gorram, previously settled at La Tanniere, in Maine. One of these, viz. William de Gorram, appears to have been the person 1 Bailiff of Shrewsbury in 1350. 3 Charters in possession of the Author. 4 Domesday, fo. 253, b, 2. * Bailiff of Shrewsbury in 1329, 1335, 5 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 166, 185. and 1336."], [676, "214 GREAT BERWICK. who had Chetton and Berwick by gift of Henry I., and Eudon by gift of Alan fitz Flaald or his son. That this William de Gorram was father of Damietta, the wife of Ranulph de Broc, is quite clear from documentary evidence ; \u2014 for instance, \" William de Gorram gives his land of Staplehurst,1 which he held under Earl William,2 to Ranulph de Broc and to his (William de Gorram' s) daughter Damata, and to their heirs ; \u2014 to hold under Earl William.\"3 Ranulph de Broc died, as we have seen, about 1187, holding half a knight's-fee in the Honour of Arundel, and probably at Staplehurst above mentioned. His wife Damietta, known to have been heiress of Berwick, Chetton, and Eudon, survived till about 1204. Ranulph de Broc apparently had a son, Robert, by his wife Damietta, which son survived him. Hence we have a Deed whereby \" Damata, formerly wife of Sir Ranulph de Broc, and Robert de Broc, her son, testify that they were present when the said Ranulph gave his land of Combdena to one Fulco de Bollard; and they confirm the donation.\"3 Again, Robert de Broc married Margaret, daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, and had by her a son, Laurence. Hence a Deed whereby \" Robert de Broc, for the (souls') health of Margaret his wife, of Sir Ranulph de Broc his father, of Laurence his son, and of Sir Richard de Beauchamp, Margaret's father, makes a grant to the Church of St. Paul of Newnham and to the Canons of Ravens den. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Stephen de Turnham, Sir Thomas Basset.\"3 However, the male line of Ranulph de Broc must have expired on the deaths of the above Robert and Laurence, and before the death of Damietta de Gorram. On the last event taking place in 1204, Stephen de Turnham, as husband of Edelina (Damietta's eldest daughter and alleged heir), obtained livery of Frelbury (Southants), and of Berwick, Chetton, and Eudon (Shropshire). The litigation which ensued between Edelina and her sisters, or the heirs and representatives of herself and her sisters, has been given already in most of its details. I now turn back a few years to add something to what has been said under Idsall,4 about Stephen de Turnham. \u2014 In 1198 (10 Ric. I.) Stephen de Turnham had a grant of the wardship of the lands and heir of Robert de Leeburn, and of the benefit of the marriage of the said heir. He gave the King 300 merks for the said wardship.5 There can be Httle doubt that the 1 Staplehurst in Kent, probably. 3 Halstead Genealogies, p. 27. 4 Supra, Vol. II. p. 286.' 6 Rot. Pipe, 10 Ric.

In 1211 we have Stephen de Turnham, as a Tenant -in-capite of Shropshire, holding 100 solidates of land by services unknown at the moment.1 The land in question was Berwick ; but Chetton was possibly included in the estimate. A Quitclaim to Shrewsbury Abbey, in which Stephen de Turnham was joined by Godelina (sic) his wife, has been given under Albrighton,2 but refers to their in terests at Berwick. In March 1214, Stephen de Turnham was dead, and it was then, doubtless, or soon after, that \"Eodelina, formerly wife of Sir Stephen de Turneham, gave to LilleshaU Abbey the Church of Chetinton (Chetton), the Chapel of Berewick, and all her right in Haremore.\"3 Within a year after Stephen de Turnham's death, and between May and December 1214, a Fine appears on the Rolls, which was originally supposed to relate to land in Shropshire; but the marginal affix Salop has been cancelled and Kent substituted. Such a confusion was natural. \u2014 \" Roger de Lei burn gives the King 20 merks that he may have such seizin of the Manor of Berwig as he had on the day when he was disseized thereof on pretext of the death of Stephen de Thorneham.\"4 It would seem that Roger de Leybourn had had seizin of some Berwig during Stephen de Turnham's life, and that on that Baron's death the Escheators had seized it as part of his estate as yet to be divided. What Berwig is alluded to, I have not inquired. Before Michaelmas 1214, Edelina, widow of Stephen de Turn ham, gave King John 60 merks and a palfrey for liberty to remarry with whom she pleased.5 She was living in Trinity Term 1220, but deceased before November 122 1.6 In January 1219, the five daughters and coheirs of Stephen de Turnham were Mabel, wife of Thomas de Bavelingham, Alice, wife of Adam de Bending, Alienore, wife of Roger de Leybourn, another Alienore, wife of Ralph fitz Bernard, and Beatrix, wife of Ralph de to oblige Sibil to observe a Fine, levied at Winchester, concerning the whole inheri tance of Damata de Goram, mother of Edelina and Sibil. 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 55. 3 Supra, page 108. 3 LilleshaU Chartulary, fo. 62. 4 Rot.

They renewed a Fine which they had made with King John for seizin of Ertindeu in Surrey;1 but it must be carefully noted that the Fine was for part of their Father's, not their Mother's, inhe ritance. Before November 1221, Alianore, wife of Roger de Leybourn, was deceased, as well as her mother; and the said Roger was seized, in her right, of the Manor of Berwick. The Suit which then commenced between Roger de Leybourn and the heirs of his late wife's Aunts (daughters of Ranulph de Broc) concerned his tenure of Berwick, and lasted for 16 years, without apparently shaking his position. The chief particulars have been given under Chetton. Meanwhile, Roger de Leybourn, as Lord of Berwick, was at issue with Lilleshull Abbey about Berwick Chapel and Harmer Pool. Henry III. visited Shrewsbury judicially in August 1226, and it was probably then that their disputes were reconciled. If so, the following curious Deed may be dated in the same year, and taken (in the absence of a formal Fine) to be the written Re cord of their agreement. \u2014 \" Omnibus Sanct\u00e6 matris Ecclesi\u00e6 filiis presentem paginam in specturis, Rogerus de Leburne, eternam in Domino salutem.

Before the year 1244 one John de Leybourn had not only succeeded to Berwick, but dying seized thereof had made way for a second Roger de Leybourn. John left a widow, Florence, who remarried to Matthias de Mara. Hence a Fine of February 3, 1244, whereby Matthias de Mara and Florence his wife (Plaintiffs) surrender Florence's claim of dower in Berewyk to Roger de Leyburn, tenant of the Manor, who gives a sore sparrow hawk as the consideration. In the year 1245 Roger de Leybourn (II) sold Berwick to Sir Geoffrey Despenser for a sum of 400 merks, reserving a nominal rent to himself, and stipulating for the Purchaser's discharge of the curious service by which the Manor was held of the Crown. I give the Deed in brief. \u2014 \" Rogerus de Leyburn, &c, dedi Domino Galfrido Despenser Manerium de Berewyk, in Com.

Henry III. recited and confirmed it, in a Charter, dated at Windsor, July 5, 1245, and attested by Fulk fitz Warin ; Sylvester de Everdon, Archdeacon of Chester ; Richard de Clifford ; and William, Provost of Beverley.1 Geoffrey Despenser seems to have been succeeded at Berwick by his son John. The PimhiU Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" John Despenser holds 1\u00a3 hides in Berewyk in capite, doing the following service in wartime whenever the King should pass into Wales, viz. providing one horseman, one man, and one Greyhound, carrying with them one gammon of bacon (pernam) ; and they must follow the King till the gammon be consumed, and afterwards, if they must remain, it shall be at the King's charges. John Despenser claimed Warren and a Franchise in Berwick ; the Jurors knew not by what warranty.\"2 I now return to Roger de Leyburn (II), whose public and poli tical career from 1252 to 1265 is fully described by Dugdale. His conduct as a Royalist during the King's captivity (that is, between the Battle of Lewes, on May 14, 1264, and the Battle of Evesham, on August 4, 1265) is evidenced by that series of delusive Patents which I have elsewhere described as addressed to Roger de Mor timer, James de Audley, and other Patriots of the Marches. A Patent of May 17 is worth quoting, as showing how the crafty Montfort, relying on his own temporary reconciliation with the powerful Earl of Gloucester, ceased inviting the King's friends \" to come to Court or to go and tarry in Ireland,\" and assumed another attitude. At Hereford, on May 20, 1265, the King is made to address Ralph Basset of Drayton, as Custos Pads, and the Sheriffs of Salop and Staffordshire. These Officers are to publish the peace concluded between Simon de Montfort and Gilbert, Earl of Glou cester ; and seeing that Roger de Clifford, Roger de Leybourn, and others, their FeUow Marchers, being bound to quit the realm under the Provisions of Worcester, had, in contempt of the King, failed to do so, the said Officers are to cause them to be arrested if they continue to alienate the affections of the King's Lieges from his person, and to disturb the Peace. 1 Rot.

On August 8, 1265 (four days after the Battle of Evesham), the King, being at Worcester, gives to Roger de Leybourn the Shriev alty of Kent and custody of the lands and person of Idonea, younger daughter and Coheir of Robert de Vipont. On August 22, the King at Gloucester gives him the Wardenry of the Cinque Ports and Chamberlainship of Sandwich. On September 20, the King, at Winchester, appoints him Sheriff of Cumberland. By Charter, dated at Canterbury on October 26, 1265, the King confirms to \" Roger de Leyburn, for his faithful services, aU the lands in Eng land which had belonged to Adam le Despencer ; \u2014 also the Manors of Kirkeosewod and of Burg, and the bailiwick of the Royal Forest of Englewod, late Thomas de Multon's ; also certain lands of Richard de Grey, Roger de St. John, John le Despencer, Ralph Pyrot, and of Robert de Vere, late Earl of Oxford, all enemies of the Crown ; \u2014 to be held by the said Roger de Leyburn under the Lords of the respective Fees.\"1 This grant of John le Despencer's lands seems to have worked an immediate reversion of the fee-sim ple of Berwick to the previous Mesne-Lord. I do not find that the benefits of the Dictum de Kenilworth were ever extended to John le Despencer. On November 5, 1271, Roger de Leyburn (II) was deceased, leaving his second wife, Alianore, widow of Roger de Quinci, Earl of Winchester, surviving.3 His heir was his son Wil liam, by a former marriage. \u2014 WiUiam de Leybourn had general Livery of the estates, held in capite by his late Father, on Nov. 7, 1271, saving the Dowery and other claims of the Countess of Winchester.3 I suppose that Simon de Leybourn, who had some feoffment or claim in Great Berwick, was a younger son of Roger, and that his claim was disallowed by his elder brother. On June 2, 1272, Simon de Leyburn was suing William de Leyburn, William Blun del, and others, for disseizing him of his free tenement in Berewyk. The Pimhill Inquest of November 1274 gives William de Ley bourne as holding Berewyk by service of a knight's-fee of the King in capite, and as exercising rights of Warren there.* The Tenure- Roll5 of 1279 shows that Simon de Ley bourne had ere then reco vered the whole estate. \u2014 \" Symond Leyburne tenet Manerium de Berewecke cum membris de Domino Regi in capite per servicia unius Montaris cum uno leperario et cum uno homine portante unam pernam secum, quotiens Rex transierit in Walliam tempore 1 Rot.

At the Assizes of October 1292, Simon de Leyburn's exercise of Free Warren in Berewyk was again presented, as was his Tenure of the Manor itself, under the head De Serjantiis. The Serjeantry was described in the same way as before, except that Simon himself seems to have been personally liable to serve, and the consumption of the gammon of bacon was to be regulated by the King's Marshal. Simon de Leybourn came forward to prove his title. It was by gift of his Father, Roger, and he asked leave of the Court to call William, his father's son and heir, to warranty. To this the King's Attorney objected, saying that \" there could be no Mesne Tenant in a Serjeantry,\" and that, \"whereas Simon could not (rightfully) perform the aforesaid service, a right had accrued to the Crown of holding the Serjeantry in demesne.\" The cause was adjourned to Lichfield till January 27th following, but I do not find it to have been renewed. At the above Assizes, Simon de Leybourn withdrew an accusation of waste against John de Ludlow, Senior, who having been his Lessee in 100 acres of bosc at Berewyk, had cut down 300 oaks; \u2014 value \u00a3100. The King's Writ of Diem clausit announcing the death of Simon de Leyborn bears date Nov. 20, 1308. ' An Inquest held at Shrews bury on Feb. 14, 1309, found him to have held the Manor of Ber wick conjointly with John, his son, by feoffment of Philip de Say (evidently a Trustee), who had settled the same on Simon, his wife, Lucia, and his son, John, and the heirs of John's body, with remain der to Matilda, John's sister, and the heirs of her body, with re mainder to the right heirs of Simon. The said Simon and his son John held the Manor under William de Leyburn, by service of doing homage and paying a pound of cummin. John de Leybourn was 14 years of age on Dec. 21, 1309. 2 The above Lucia, wife of Simon de Leybourne, was sister and eventual heir of John le Strange of Cheswardine. I conclude that she was also an illegitimate daughter of Roger le Strange of Elles- mere. 1 Mr. Blakeway assigned to this Sir Si mon de Leyburn a Monument which for merly stood in the Trinity Chapel of St. Mary's Church, Shrewsbury ; and which still exists.

John de Leybourn appears in the Nomina Villarum of March 1316 as Lord of Berwick. His career, military and political, has been described by Dugdale, though the Great Antiquary failed to discover his origin. His being summoned to Parliament as a Baron was evidently due to his marriage with Beatrix de Beauchamp, widow of Peter, last Baron Corbet of Caus. How far this John de Leybourn inherited any Shropshire estates in right of his mother, Lucia,1 and how he and his wife both died without heirs, having succeeded in alienating several Corbet estates to the Beauchamps of Hach, her relations;2 \u2014 these are matters on which I have spoken elsewhere. John de Leybourn died Oct. 6, 1348, but the Inquest, taken at Exeter, deals only with estates held by him for life by settlement with his deceased wife.3 His own heir, and the destination of the Manor of Berwick are not noticed. I have not ascertained whether Berwick descended in any way consonant with the remainder to Matilda, sister of John de Ley burn. Some Heraldic Pedigrees give a sister and heir of the said John as married to Geoffrey to Lucy ; but by these authorities the Lady is called \" Katherine.\"4 Parochially, Great Berwick and its member, Little Berwick, were in the Parish of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury. They still remain so. The grant of Berwick Chapel to Lilleshull Abbey, early in the 13th century, does not seem to have been opposed by the Dean and Chapter of St. Mary's. The Grant is included and confirmed in a Bull which I take to be that of Pope Honorius III., and if so to have passed between 1216 and 1227. An old Rent-Roil of Lilles hull Abbey gives 6s. 8d. as the annual profits arising from the Chapel of Berewick.5 The Valor of 1535 combines the Rectorial Income of St. i^fc mund's Church with that from the Chapel of Berwick, and states the Abbey to be in receipt of \u00a36 yearly from the two sources.6 It also appears that a pension of 18s. per annum was payable by the 1 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 16. mon's elder brother) failed in 1389, on the death (without issue) of John de Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, the Great-great-great- Grandson and heir of the said William. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 38, 39. 3 Inquis. 22 Edw.

Possibly this Adam le Strange may be the person of that name who in the year 1177 had received 15 merks from the Sheriff of Shropshire by order of King Henry II. Possibly, too, he may be that Adam, son of Hamo le Strange, who between the years 1170 and 1179 attests two Charters of Guy le Strange, of Knokyn and Alveley.

The Scutage-Rolls from 1203 to 1246, inclusive, show Lop pington as assessed at the current rate on a knight's-fee ; and Richard de Lopington is in each case the person charged. In the scutages of 1254 and 1260 Loppington was not assessed at all.2 In the Tenure-Roll of 1211 Richard de Lopinton is said to hold of the King by service of one knight, and his tenure is inaccurately classed among the Escheats of Gerard de Thurnay.3 At the Assizes of November 1221 there was a Trial of Grand Assize as to whether William le Strange ought to hold a hide in Lopinton under Richard de Lopinton (Plaintiff), or whether the latter should hold it in demesne. It was decided in favour of Le Strange, because Richard's father (Alexander) had given the pre mises to his (Alexander's) daughter, the mother of the Defendant ; and Le Strange and his heirs were to hold from thenceforth under the Plaintiff. It is noted that Richard de Lopinton acknowledged the gift made to William le Strange's mother, but questioned his father's power thus to dispose of half the estate. A second Trial accused William le Strange of disseizing Richard de Lopinton of a tenement in Lopinton. Here William le Strange proved that he had taken nothing but pannage upon certain swine. In a third case William le Strange recovered a right of common in Lopinton, of which he had been disseized by Richard de Lopinton and Alexander de Franketon.* In a fourth case Richard de Lopinton recovered a tenement in Lopinton against Walter de Franketon and William de Lopinton, who had disseized him thereof.5 At these Assizes the Jurors of Pimhill Hundred presented that \" Richard de Lopinton held the land of Lopinton of the Lord King. It was worth 100*. ( per annum) and was held by service of one knight.\" 1 Episcopus Pangor r. c. de v marcis de fine suo de terra Ricardi de Lopinton. 2 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 197. 3 Testa de Nevill, p. 56. 4 Robert de Wufericton, William de Stanwurdin, Reginald de Franketon, Wil- liam de Lopinton, and William de Han worth were mixed up in these cases as Sureties. 5 There was also a William de Lopinton amerced half a merk in 1232 pro salso clamore. 29"], [688, "226 LOPPINGTON. When Alexander de Lopington is said \" to have given half Loping ton to his daughter,\" half of Loppington proper or half of two hides must be understood ; for three out of the five hides of the Manor were in Burleton, and there Alexander de Loppington had enfeoffed another son-in-law at a still earlier period. This appears in a Fine, levied Nov. 12, 1240, whereby Richard de Lopinton (Plaintiff) al lowed the right of Robert de Burgheton (Tenant) to 3 hides in Burgheton, whereof there had been suit-at-law. The Tenant was to hold in fee, under Richard de Lopinton, and to perform three parts of that knight's-service of 40 days, for which the whole 5 hides were responsible, in the King's host, so often as the host was summoned between Pouwiz and England in wartime. The Tenant was to per form such share of service at his own cost and was also to perform all forinsec service due on the Manor in the proportion of three to two. This was to cover all claims against him, and he paid 4 merks down to the Plaintiff. When the Feodary of 1240 registers, among the fees of Tornay, half a fee in Lopinton, as held by Richard de Lopinton,1 it must not be supposed that the alleged half-fee bears any reference to the above arrangement between Lord and Vassal. The half-fee is pro bably a mere error, corrected by Scutage-Rolls and other docu ments, or else it alludes to personal service in the King's host else where than in Wales and Shropshire. At the Inquest of 1255 Richard de Lopinton was Foreman of the Pimhill Jurors. They stated, with technical accuracy, that \"he held five geldable hides in Lopinton and Burelton, of the King's fee, by service of one knight for 40 days in Wales and in time of war. He owed suit to County and Hundred, and paid 3s. Ad. yearly for stretward and motfee.\"2 At the Assizes of 1256 Richard de Lopinton was second Juror for Pimhill Hundred. His wife, then living, was Susanna, daughter, and apparently heir, of Peter de Eston, of whom we shall hear elsewhere. A lost Inquest of 41 Henry III. (1256-7) is described as alluding to Richard de Lopinton and the Manor of Pouwiz.3 It probably concerned the death of Richard de Lopinton and the relevance of his tenure to service in Powis-land, but as to any Manor of Pouwiz, such a thing never existed in Shropshire. From the Tenure-Roll of 1257 it appears that, on July 25 of that year, the King received the homage of Richard, son and heir of 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 45. 2 Rot. Hundred.

I think it passed in 1256-7. If so, it was perhaps a dying bequest of Richard de Lopinton (I). As \" Richard de Lopinton,\" and \"for the souls' health of himself and his Ancestors, he concedes to the Canons of Wombridge license to get every sort of bosc for building, fencing, or other purposes, in his woods and moors pertaining to Lopinton, for the use of themselves and their men of Lopinton. He adds common pasture and free pannage for the animals and swine of themselves and their men, throughout the Fee of Lo pinton. He allows that all who hold in his Fee of Lopinton and of BurweU' (Burleton) may give or bequeath lands or rents to the said Canons. He lastly concedes the Church and Advowson of Lopinton.

After his Livery in 1257, I hear nothing of him till he occurs as Juror on a local Inquest of May 1274. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll, of November 1274, separates Loppington into three distinct portions. \u2014 1. Burleton, formerly given to William de Burweltone with a daughter of Alexander de Lopinton, had been still more thoroughly alienated by Richard de Lopinton, now living. He had enfeoffed Sir John fitz Alan \" in the homage and service of the Lord of Bur weltone,\" that is, he had sold the Mesne tenure. \" Hence,\" said the Pimhill Jurors, \" the King might probably lose wardship and custody.\"3 2. That half of Lopinton (proper), which had originally gone to Adam le Strange, had been given in fee, by John le Strange of Lo pinton,4 to the Abbot of Lilleshull. The Abbot had enfeoffed Sir William le Botiler, and the latter was now in possession. The Ab- 4 Probably son of Wilham, son of Adam le Strange.

The other half of Lopinton (proper) was still held in capite by Richard de Lopinton (II). Soon after this Inquest was taken, Richard de Lopinton (II) sold this last remaining share of his inheritance to the same William le Botiler as had obtained the second share. And this was apparently with consent of the Crown : for on January 10, 1278, \"tbe King accepted the homage of William le Botiler, son and heir of Ralph le Botiler of Wemme, for the Manor of Lopinton, which the said William had by concession of the Abbot of Lilleshull and of Ri chard de Lopinton.\"1 William le Botiler's Father, Ralph, was living at this time, but died in 1281. The Pymhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 says, with great accuracy, that \" William le Buttiler holds Loppynton of the King in capite, by service of one Knight's-fee for the aforesaid vill.\" The Tenure-Roll of 1284, usually known as Kirby's Quest, says, with great inaccuracy, both as to names and facts, that Richard de Lo piton holds Hopiton and Burghulton ofthe King in capite.\" William le Botiler of Wem died in or before December 1283, not seized of the Barony of Wem, which was still in the hands of his mother, but seized of Lopinton, where his estate was valued at .\u20ac2. 19*. 8\\d. per annum.2 Gawan le Botiler, second son and eventual heir of the above William, died, as we have seen, in 1290.3 His seizin of only two thirds of Loppington was probably because the widow of his elder brother, John, had her dower therein. At the Assizes of 1292 the Pymhill Jurors presented that \" Wil liam le Botyler had withdrawn the suit of half Lopynton from the Sheriff's Tourn 30 years back.\" This gives the proximate date of the purchase of one moiety of Loppinton from the Abbot of Lil leshull. As to the matter of withdrawal, that could not be gone into, because the heir of Loppington (erroneously called \" E.4 son of William le Botiler\") was in minority. As to the vicissitudes which had befallen the collective Manor of Loppington and Burleton, the Pimhill Jurors of 1292 add some thing to our previous information. They said that Alexander de Lopinton's original feoffment of William de Borelton reserved only the service of one-third of a knight's-fee, and that Richard de Lo- 1 Rot. Finium, 6 Edw.

However, the service by which Burleton was held at the time of that sale must have been three-fourths of a Fee, as settled in the Fine of 1240. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, William le Botiller (II) is en tered as Lord of Franketon, Lopinton, and Burwalton. This, as regards Franketon, I cannot understand. At his death in 1334, William le Botiler (II) was seized of nothing there. Of Lopping ton he had probably made some settlement during his life ; for his son and heir, WTilliam le Botiler (III), settled that Manor in tail, by a Fine of 1343. Loppington indeed continued to be part ofthe Barony of Wem for several generations, descending to the Lord Ferrers of Wem, and to the Barons Greystock, in the mode indi cated on a former page.1 Burleton, consisting of three out of the five Domesday hides of Loppington, was given in frank marriage to \u2014 William de Burleton, with the daughter of Alexander de Loppington. The full particulars have been told already. This was probably in the reign of Henry II. or Richard I. John de Burleton, probably son and heir of William, occurs incidentally from about 1195 to about 1220.2 At the Assizes of November 1221, John de Burleton had apparently been succeeded by- Robert de Burleton, for the latter was impleaded by Richard de Lopinton for 7 acres of bosc in Burghelton, which the said Ri chard claimed as heir of Alexander de Lopinton, his Father. Robert de Burghelton paid half a merk for license to compound this suit. This was that Robert de Burleton who, in 1240, readjusted the ser vice by which Burleton was held under the Lord of Loppington. The next head of this family was \u2014 John de Burleton (II), who occurs as a witness about 1256-7. He further occurs on a local Jury in 1274. It was during his time that Burleton became separated from Loppington and annexed to the Fief of Fitz Alan ; a status which it retained ever afterwards. William de Burleton (II) occurs on a local Jury in December 1291, but was apparently deceased in January 1301. It then tran spired that John de Burleton (II) had enfeoffed Robert Corbet of Morton and his wife Matilda, conjointly, in half a virgate in Bur leton. This half-virgate was now held by the said Matilda under the \"heir of William de Burleton.\"3 1 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 22. 2 Supra, p. 74 ; infra, pp. 234-5. 3 Inquis. 29 Ed.

The Lords of Loppington founded the subject Church ; \u2014 apparently after some arrangement with the Rectors of Baschurch, for the Pension which Baschurch had from Loppington implies as much.1 About 1190 (as we have seen) Alexander de Loppington gave the Advowson of Loppington to Wombridge Priory. A Deed in the Wombridge Chartulary, ascribed to \" Henry Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of all England,\" should have stood, as I doubt not it originally stood, as a Deed of H., Archbishop of Can terbury, &c, that is of Hubert Walter. It probably passed in 1193-5, subsequent to which that famous Prelate would have used his added title of \" Legate of the Apostolick See.\" It appears from this Deed that there had been a dispute of long standing between the Canons of Wombridge and one Radulf Valenseus, a Clerk, about this Church. The Archbishop decides that \" the Canons are to be no longer molested by any claim of Radulf, but for charity and for the sake of peace, and for the soul of the most illustrious King Henry, are to pay him three merks yearly, out of the goods of their Church, viz. by half-yearly instalments on June 25 and Dec. 25.\"2 I suppose the above Radulf claimed to be Rector of Loppington by some other title than the Canons' presentation. On July 25, 1232, the Church of Loppington was vacant, and \" Alexander, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, expedited a Charter, allowing the Prior and Canons of Wombridge to appropriate it, saving a competent provision for the future Vicar, and saving all pontifical and parochial rights of the Bishop, of his Successors, and of the Churches of Coventry and Lichfield.\" It was the \" praise worthy conversation\" and also the \"poverty\" of the Wombridge Canons which ostensibly moved the Bishop to the aforesaid step.3 The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Lopington (in the Deanery and Archdeaconry of Salop) at \u00a35 per annum, besides a pension of 2s., which the Vicar of Bassechurch received therefrom.4 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth quoted the above Taxation as one of \u00a35, and reduced it to \u00a33 for the current Levy. The rea sons were, because a great part of the land lay fallow and untilled, the tenants being poverty-stricken, because there had been a gene- 1 Supra, page 139. 3 Chartulary (ut supra), No. III. 4 Pope Nich.

He further ordains the future Vicarage, viz. \" the Vicar was to have, for his manse, that messuage and those buildings and half-virgate in Lopinton, heretofore held by Richard Steven, at farm under Wombridge Priory. The Vicar was also to have all the small tithes and oblations of the Parish, and all the fruits, rents, and spiritualities, including the wheat-tithes of all Lo pington Parish and the hay-tithes of Burleton. The Vicar was to minister to the Church and Parishioners, congruously in all things, at his own cost ; but the Rectors were to undertake all other bur dens, ordinary and extraordinary, incumbent on the Church.\"2 Much to the credit of Bishop Stretton is this qualification of the iniquitous looseness of his predecessor. The result is seen in the Valor of 1534-5. All the tithes of Loppington which the Canons of Wombridge had to dispose of were set at an annual farm of \u00a33. 16s. 8d? At the same time Humphry Clay, Vicar of Lopynton, had an income of \u00a36. 13s. Ad., less Is. 3d. for annual synodals.4 EARLY INCUMBENTS. There is no appearance of any Vicars having been canonically in stituted to this Church till after Bishop Stretton had ordained the Vicarage. The following were all presented by the Prior and Con vent of Wombridge : \u2014 Brother John Dynmowe, a Canon of Wombridge, was insti tuted on Sept. 5, 1374, to the newly constituted Vicarage of Lop pington. Brother Richard de Madelegh, Canon of Wombridge, was instituted March 12, 1377, but resigned immediately. Bartholomew de Grenhull,6 Priest, instituted April 1, 1377, resigned in 1382.

However, there are points of exceeding interest which attach to Ellesmere, even in the dark century which followed Domesday. The first fact which transpires affects the single hide held by Rainaldus. This Rainaldus was no other than Rainald the Sheriff. The hide he held was Lea, and he gave it, within 10 years after Domesday, to Shrewsbury Abbey. \u2014 \" Rainaldus frater Guarini dedit eis villam qu\u00e6 dicitur Lega,\" says Earl Roger in his Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, and Earl Roger died in 1093-4. King William II.'s Con firmation contains the very same words. Henry I.'s Confirmation of 1121 is still more explicit; \u2014 \"Rainaldus vero frater Warini Vicecomitis dedit unam hidam qu\u00e6 vocatur Lega.\" The Confir mations of Stephen, Henry IL, and Henry III. repeat the statement in terms which present no further illustration of the main fact. Now follows a much more general theme. \u2014 Ellesmere was the most important of several Border Manors which King Henry I. be stowed on William Peverel, of Dover, one of those Brethren to whom I have before alluded,2 as enjoying the high favour of that Monarch, though their origin is wrapped in mystery. A solitary event is all that we can trace of William Peverel's dealings at Ellesmere. \" He unjustly deprived the Monks of Shrewsbury of their estate at Lea.\" We have seen that William Peverel, of Dover, as well as his brother, Hamo Peverel, of High Ercall, was deceased before the year 1138, Domesday, fo. 253, b, 2. \u25a0 Supra, Vol. II. p. 105."], [695, "ELLESMERE. 233 and the heirship of these mighty Barons was ostensibly divided be tween their brother's son, William Peverel (II), of Dover and of Brun, and Walcheline Maminoht, who, I think, was their sister's son. By two mere accidents we are able to associate the names of both these youths with the history of Ellesmere.\u2014 Ordericus, de scribing that outbreak against Stephen which took place in the summer of 1238, gives the following local and personal particulars. \u2014Gualchelinus autem cognomento Maminot tenuit Doveram. Guil lelmus vero juvenis cognomento Peverellus quatuor oppida habebat .- id est Brunam, Elesmaram, Obretonam et Guitentonam1 et his turbidus augebat rebellantium turmam. As to Walcheline Maminot's concern with Ellesmere it is evidenced in the Charter whereby he restored Lea to the Monks of Shrewsbury, \"after consulting the men of Ellesmere as to the Monks' title, and because he was anxious to liberate his late Uncle's soul from the pains of sacrilege.\" This curious Charter, though printed elsewhere,2 I cannot refrain from transcribing. \u2014 Walchelinus Maminot omnibus parentibus et amicis suis, et uni versis fidelibus Sanct\u0153 Ecclesi\u00e6 salutem. Sciatis quod homines de Ellesmerd confessi sunt coram me et militibus meis quod avunculus meus Willielmus Peverel injuste abstulit terram de Lega a Monachis de Salopesberid.

How Ellesmere fared when Shrewsbury fell before the Usurper, Stephen, we cannot guess. The subsequent demonstrations of William Peverel in the cause of the Empress were not on the Bor ders of Wales, but in the South of England. This noble youth, sickened with civil war, but still animated with an heroic spirit of self-devotion, at length found his grave in Palestine. I have said much of his collateral heirs under High Ercall. It is clear that dington (Northants).\" Only Ellesmere is rightly identified.

Ellesmere was one of those Manors from which the Coheirs of Pe verel, no less than Walcheline Maminot himself, were excluded on the restoration of Henry II. Ellesmere came to that King's hand as a Manor of ancient demesne, whose fiscal value was \u00a310 of the \u00a3265. 15s. which was settled to be the Ferm of Shropshire. Diceto is confirmed by the Pipe- Rolls in giving 1174 as the year in which David ap Owen, Prince of North Wales, married Emma, the Sister of King Henry II.1 I suppose this Lady to have been (like Hameline Plantagenet, Earl of Surrey) one of the illegitimate children of Geoffrey, Earl of Anjou. There are evidences, on the Pipe-Roll of 1176, ofthe wife of David ap Owen having visited her brother. The Burgesses of Brug and Salop had respectively sup plied \u00a37. 2s. and \u00a31. 15s. in corrodies for the \" King's Sister, wife of David fitz Oen,\" and this by the King's order. It was at Oxford, and probably in May 1177, that the King in full Council is said to have conferred \" the land of Ellesmare on David fitz Owain, who had married his Sister.\"2 It does not appear that the Contemporary Sheriff was allowed to deduct anything from the ferm of Shropshire by reason of this grant. Nevertheless the actuality of the grant is undoubted. Cricket was a member of Ellesmere, and we have a Charter whereby, about the year 1195, \" David ap Owen and Emma his wife, at request of Owen, their son and heir, gave the whole land of Crikcote to Haghmon, together with pannage for 100 swine. Witnesses, \u2014 John de Burcheltun, Einion de Hordeley, Reiner, Par son of Ellesmere.\"3 On April 10, 12C0, King John (by Charter, dated at Worcester) extended the most ample protection to Emma, wife of David ap Owen, her lands and possessions, and ordered that she should not be impleaded, except before the King himself, for any tenement which she held on that day when Henry II. gave her the Manors of Ellesmere and Hales.4 Hales was afterwards called Hales-Owen, from Owen, son of this Emma. The reason that Emma is here spoken of as \" Lady of Ellesmere and Hales,\" was because her husband was now suffering his third year of imprisonment at the hands of his Nephew, Lewel lyn. During the latter part of David ap Owen's imprisonment, that is, in September and October 1203, it is apparent that Elles mere was in the hands of King John. Some evidence of this will transpire under Stockett, but here, I should observe that, at 1 See Madox's Exchequer, p. 251-k. - Hoveden, p. 323-b. 3 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit. Crikcote. I 4 Rot.

It is also worth notice that, at the Shropshire Assizes of October 1203, the Villate of Ellesmere was represented by its Provost and Jurors, like other Manors of Royal demesne. Among their presentments were two of murder. Peter fitz Alan had slain one Aldred, and had been outlawed at the suit of John de Buregeton (Burleton). Also Roger, a tenant of Robert de Girros, having slain Simon, a serviens.ot the said Robert, had taken sanctuary in the first instance, but had since acknowledged his guilt and abjured the Realm. David ap Owen, once Prince of North Wales, was released from prison by Lewellyn, and died in 1204. There is no appearance that King John restored either him or his son Owen to their rights at Ellesmere. It was probably during his father's lifetime and im prisonment, that the said Owen, having a talem qualem claim to Ellesmere, confirmed his father's grant to Haghmon Abbey. As \" Owen, son of David, and for the souls' health of himself, his fa ther, and mother, he confirmed the Canons in possession of Crikcote, and in their rights of pannage in Nordwode.

Before the King had been five months on the throne he had, on the other hand, openly recognized the claims of Lewellyn ap Jorworth, and taken him under his protection. In July 1201 a Treaty was con cluded between John and Lewellyn, the latter undertaking to do fealty to the King as soon as he should return into England. (The King was then at Paris.) Further negotiations ensued. At Michaelmas 1204 it is again apparent that John was in possession of Ellesmere, for the Pipe- Roll of that date shows that Ellesmere Castle had been repaired at the King's expense. On October 14, 1204, King John orders the Sheriff of Warwickshire to value Ro bert de H arcourt' s Manor of Illandon, and to give 13 librates therein to Owen fitz David, in exchange for Owen's land of Elles mere, which the King had retained for his own use.1 Again, on' Nov. 5 1205, King John assigns to the same Owen 15 Librates of land in Waltham (Lincolnshire).2 So far John seems to have treated his Cousin vvith justice, for he had never promised him a i \u2022 : Rot.

Passing over Letters of safe-conduct, and invitations to meet the King, we come to the month of August 1204, when it is evident that John had bribed Lewellyn's minister, Ostruc, with an annuity of 100s. and a promise of Church preferment. Before Oct. 15, 1204, Lewellyn had married the King's natural daughter, Joan ; and the King orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to assign 20 librates of lands as the marriage portion bestowed by the King.1 The as- signment took place, partly at least, in Ellesmere ; for from Christ- mas 1204 the fiscal value of Ellesmere (\u00a310 per annum) is deducted from the Sheriff's liabilities, as given to Lewellyn of Wales (Leulino Walensi). A Patent of March 23, 1205, instructs Thomas de Er- dinton, then Custos of Ellesmere Castle, to give the same up to Lewellyn.2 A Writ-Close, to the same effect, is directed to the Sheriff of Shropshire, in which the King styles Lewellyn \" our be- loved Son.\" On April 16, 1205, King John being at Dover, certi- fies by Charter how he had given to Lewellyn, Prince of North Wales, the Castle of Ellesmere, with all its lands and appurtenances, in marriage with the aforesaid Joan, the King's daughter, and with remainder to the heirs of their bodies ; \u2014 saving all other agreements, made between the King and Prince, touching the said land and marriage.3 In January 1209 we begin to hear of excesses com mitted by the Welsh Prince, and of the Earl of Chester's watch over his movements being sanctioned and encouraged by King John. Nevertheless the King continued to bribe Lewellyn's Clerk (here called Instructus) with Church preferment, and to send messengers to the Prince himself. At Michaelmas 1209 Lewellyn was yet un disturbed in the fiscal assignation of the whole profits of Ellesmere, viz. \u00a310 per annum for the two years then ended. A Writ-Close of August 3, 1212, implies the previous rebellion of Lewellyn against his Father-in-law ;4 and we hear no more for the present of any pe cuniary advantage resulting to him as Lord of Ellesmere. It is probable indeed that he had been deprived of Ellesmere Castle some time before he forfeited the estate. I suppose Bartholomew Toret to be the person addressed as Bartholomew Turot in a threatening letter of December 18, 1208 ; but how he became Castellan of Elles mere does not appear .---\u25a0\u2022\" As he loves his own body and all his pos sessions,\" King John orders him, \" as soon as he sees this Writ, to deliver up the Castle of Eselmere to William Earl of Salisbury, the 1 Rot.

King's brother, and to Thomas de Erdinton, who are to keep it by the King's wish.\"1 A Tenure-Roll of June 1211 shows Robert Lupus as holding the Manor of Ellesmere, de ballivd Regis Johannis, as the phrase was, that is, only as a temporary trust at the King's pleasure. The Exche quer value of the Manor, viz. \u00a310 per annum, is at the same time certified.2 In 1212 the Justices of the Forest amerced the town of Elles mere 20s. for some fault ; but the Rolls of 14 years following show that the debt was not paid. A Writ-Close of August 23, 1214, orders Peter, Bishop of Winchester and Justice of England, to give custody of Ellesmere, either to Thomas de Erdinton, Sheriff of Shropshire, or to John Marescall, Sheriff of Lincolnshire, which ever he should find most convenient.3 King Henry III. entered early in his reign on negotiations with Lewellyn. One symptom of this is the restoration of Ellesmere to the Prince. The Pipe-Roll of 1220 assigns him \u00a330, or three years' fiscal value of Ellesmere; and the Pipe-Roll of Michaelmas 1221 gives him \u00a310 for the year then ended, and on the same account. On July 2, 1221, the King being at Shrewsbury, allows Lewellyn, Prince of North Wales, to hold a weekly Market on Tuesdays at his Manor of Ellesmere till the King should be of age.4 As far as the Pipe- Rolls are evidence, Lewellyn continued to be Lord of Ellesmere till Michaelmas 1230; but the Roll of 1231 leaves a blank in the item, Ellesmere, where Llewellyn's name should have stood, aud shows by a supplementary entry that the Sheriff of Shropshire was answerable for the issues of the Manor as an escheat. The sequence of events which corresponded with the above fiscal accounts has been marked under Condover.5 Suffice it to repeat that with the year 1231 and the campaign of Elvein, were closed all Lewellyn's pretensions to the bounty of King Henry III. I should now mark one or two circumstances which characterized the period of Lewellyn's tenure of this Manor. Between the years 1205 and 1208, as \"Prince of North Wales,\" he confirmed and enfranchised certain acquisitions which the Canons of Haghmon had made in Newton, near Ellesmere. \u2014 A Westminster Plea- Roll of Hilary Term 1221 marks for con sultation with the Crown the circumstance of Llewellyn having made pourpresture on the King in his Hundreds of Chirbury and Elles- 34 Rot.

At the Shrewsbury Assizes of November 1221 the Jurors of Pimhill Hundred represented that the \" Church of Ellesmere, worth 20 merks yearly, ought to be in the King's gift ;\" and how \" Lewellyn held the Manor by the King's authority,\" and how \"the Manor came not to answer before the King's Justices, as it was wont.\" Ideo ad judicium de eis are the words appended to this presentment ; meaning, I presume, that the Court reserved the points raised, for higher consideration. After the period of Lewellyn's reign in Ellesmere, and as soon after as the year 1232, the Town was amerced by Justices of the Forest sitting at Shrewsbury. From the year 1232 to the year 1283 inclusive, that part of each Shropshire Pipe- Roll which we call the Corpus Comitatus contains an entry in the following or in some tantamount form of words. \u2014 In terris datis. Et \u00a310 in Ellesmere de quibus compotus debet reddi per se. The meaning of this is that Ellesmere was per manently excepted from the Corpus Comitatus ; that it was not given, out and out, to any individual, nor was the Sheriff to farm it on the old principle of paying \u00a310 per annum; that, whether farmed by the Sheriff, or by a Custos, or given temporarily to a subject, Elles mere was expected to form the subject of a separate account or schedule, entered on the lower part of each Pipe-Roll. Such a Sche dule appears, however, very seldom, owing, I think, to the excep tional way in which the Crown dealt with this Manor. From 1232 to 1241 the contemporary Sheriffs had custody of Ellesmere, but without rendering any specific account. In the year 1242 the Sheriff, John le Strange, had expended \u00a321. 3s. Ad. on the Castle works. He charged the sum to the Crown, but it was given him to understand for the future that he was to maintain the custody of the Castle out of the profits of the Manor. Such an arrangement fully accounts for the subsequent omission of any balanced statement. In 1248, when John le Strange was succeeded in the Shrievalty by Thomas Corbet, and in 1250, when Corbet gave way to Grendon, Ellesmere Castle was in each instance specified as an item of trust.1 On the Pipe-Roll of 1253 we have a regular account of Thomas Corbet's receipts from Ellesmere between 1248 and 1250. From Easter 1248 to Easter 1249 the assized rents of Ellesmere and its members were \u00a316. 3s., the Pleas and perquisites of Court were \u00a38. 3s. 7d. From Easter 1249 to Easter 1250 the gross receipts 1 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 278, 279."], [701, "239 ELLESMERE. were \u00a321. 9s. lid The whole sum of \u00a345. 16s. 6d. still remained due from Corbet to the Crown. By a Patent of July 20, 1253, the King announces that he had demised tbe Manor and Hundred of Ellesmere to John de Grey, for a term of 15 years, at an annual rent of \u00a320. This arrange ment was in force when the Inquest of 1255 was taken. The Pim hill Jurors reported that \" the Manor of Ellesmere had withdrawn from those usual responsibilities to the County which other Manors of the King were wont to observe ; and this withdrawal was of two years standing, and was effected by Sir John de Grey, and involved 20s. annual damage to the Crown.\"1 It is very remarkable that the Assize-Roll of January 1256 gives Gilbert fitz Roger, Bailiff of Ellesmere, as duly attending to represent the Manor, but that he was unaccompanied by a single Juror. I doubt not that this irre gularity was caused by John de Grey, who appears to have made it his business to abridge the King's prerogatives at Ellesmere. In 1256 it seems to have been expected that the Sheriff (Hugh de Acovere) should account something (the sum left blank) for the profits arising from the sale of fish taken in the King's Meres at Ellesmere. Hugh de Acovere had been appointed to custody of the Castles and Counties of Salop and Staffordshire, on Oct. 30, 1255, with the understanding that he was to pay a Proficuum, or increased ferm of \u00a3126. 13s. Ad., and take custody of the Castles generally, at his own cost. On June 12, 1256, he is ordered to displace John de Grey from the custody of Ellesmere Castle and Manor. John de Grey had a corresponding order to surrender the premises ; the Patent reciting that, though the terra of his tenure was unexpired, he had forfeited it by judgment of the Barons of the Exchequer. Another Patent of the same day appoints three Justiciars (Odo de Hodnet, Stephen de Buterley, and Roger de Pwelesdon) to make a general valuation of Ellesmere. A third Patent, of Oct. 17, 1256, informs the Sheriff of Shropshire and the Tenants of Ellesmere that the King has granted the Manor to his son Edward, for a term of 10 vears and a rent of \u00a330 pesr annum. It ss not difficult to reconcile the above with Hugh de Acovere's account as Sheriff at Michaelmas 1257. He had expended the great sum of \u00a3116. 9s. A\\d. in repairing the three Castles of Brug, Salop, and Ellesmere, under view of William Barel and Richard fitz Herbert, as regarded Ellesmere. He had further repaired the King's house in Ellesmere Castle at a cost of \u00a35. 10s. 9d. This was all by 1 Rot. Hundred. II. 76."], [702, "240 ELLESMERE. the King's Order. It is evident that the Sheriff's original contract had been modified under recent exigencies, even if Ellesmere was' not at the moment destined to be a residence for Prince Edward. This same Pipe- Roll of 1257 contains a schedule of John de Grey's liabilities, as late Fermor of Ellesmere. From July 1253 to June 12, 1256, is reckoned as 2| years. His debt was therefore \u00a355, but it was more than balanced by his over-outlay as recorded in the Pipe-Roll of Buckinghamshire. For the interval between Grey's surrender and Prince Edward's seizin of Ellesmere, Hugh de Aco vere accounted. I have elsewhere quoted a Patent of June 23, 1258, which shows that Peter de Montfort was thrust upon the King as Custos of Bridgnorth Castle by the Parliament of Oxford.1 Something of the same kind happened in respect of Ellesmere ; and another Patent of June 30, empowers Peter de Montfort to levy customs for five years, to enable him to wall the town of Ellesmere.2 A Patent of November 11, 1259, gives Peter de Montfort custody ofthe Manor of Stretton till Whitsunday next, as also of the Castle and Manor of Ellesmere, previously entrusted to him. It was now, I presume, that Peter de Montfort purchased or obtained the adjacent Manors of Coolmere and Hampton from their respective owners.3 The Pipe-Roll of 1257, 1258, and 1259 debit Prince Edward with \u00a390, for three years' ferm of Ellesmere, but without any in stalment being paid, then or afterwards. On November 22, 1263, Hamo le Strange was appointed Custos of the Castles of Shrews bury, Brug, and Montgomery. He had already been employed in the King's service since the year 1255, and had received a fixed salary of 30 merks per annum. A Patent of December 16, 1263, gives him seizin of the Manor, Castle, and Hundred of Ellesmere, with all appurtenances, for 17 years to come, and in lieu ofthe said salary. Another Patent of Dec. 24, 1263, shows the King's exi gencies, in that he had recourse to the unusual expedient of ap pointing Keepers of the Peace for the Counties of Salop and Stafford. Roger de Mortimer, John fitz Alan, James de Audley, John de Ver don, and Hamo le Strange (Sheriff already) were the five Commis sioners, and we may be sure that in this appointment the King was uncontrolled by the Barons' party. But the junction of the Earls of Leicester and Gloucester, in March 1264,4 threw the King at once on other resources. On the 20th of that month, being at Oxford, 1 Supra, Vol. I. p. 280. 2 Dugdale's Warwickshire, p. 801-a. I 3 Supra, pp. 93, 196. 4 Vide supra, page 218."], [703, "241 ELLESMERE. he writes to Hamo le Strange, bidding him come at once to Court, with horses, arms, and loyal followers, ready to give advice on the state of affairs. The King promises to pay his expenses, and tells him to induce the Knights of the above two Counties to accompany him. It will be remembered that the Battle of Lewes, fought on May 14, 1264, made King Henry the prisoner of Simon de Montfort. A Pseudo-Patent of July 18, following, enjoins the Knights and lieges of Shropshire to aid the Earls of Leicester and Gloucester with horses and arms against those who opposed the King and de tained his Castles in the Marches of Wales. Subsequent letters, whether cajoling, threatening, or denouncing Hamo le Strange,1 show that his loyalty remained firm, till the misfortune of Lewes was retrieved at Evesham. It is even possible that Hamo le Strange continued to hold Ellesmere during this interval ; for I nowhere find evidence of the place having been occupied by any of Leicester's party. On the other hand, we have a Pseudo-Patent of June 18, 1265,- which shows Montfort's treason to both his King and Country in the most revolting aspect. The King, then a Prisoner at Here ford, is made to offer or grant the following favours to Lewellyn, for the price of 30,000 merks, viz. remission of the King's enmity ; the Principality of North Wales ; Castle Matilda (in Elvein) ; and the Hundred of Ellesmere. Further, the King promises to aid the said Lewellyn in the conquest of any lands which were in the hands of the adversaries of the King or Prince. It is obvious that this Patent was levelled personally against Hamo le Strange and the Marchers of Shropshire, and that Montfort was ready to betray the integrity of the realm, rather than forego a political grudge. Yet this is the man whom certain Writers on the English Constitution love to glorify as one of its greatest Founders. From this disgusting episode we may pass to events of another complexion. \u2014 On Feb. 21, 1267, the enfranchised King, then at St. Edmund bury, concedes the Manor, Castle, and Hundred of Ellesmere, and the Manor of Strattondale, to Hamo le Strange, in reward of the faithful services he was then rendering to the Crown; the premises, with all appurtenances, to be held by the said Hamo and his heirs, till such time as the King should provide the said Hamo, out of his escheats with 100 librates of land in some competent situation. And if, at such time, the said Hamo or his heirs should be found to have spent anything in repairs or improvements (at Ellesmere or 1 Vide supra, Vol. I. pp. 284, 285. 31"], [704, "242 ELLESMERE. Stretton), they should be entitled to retain the said Manors till they had been reimbursed.1 We have seen that Hamo le Strange, probably when thus reseized of Ellesmere, purchased Coolmere and Welch-hampton from Sir Peter de Montfort, and enfeoffed his brother Roger in all three estates. From the date at which this feoffment necessarily took place, and the fact that Hamo le Strange was deceased in March 1274, I should rather suppose that he was one of the Crusaders who accompanied Prince Edward in 1270. I think I have somewhere seen other evidence suggestive of the same fact. If it were so, doubtless this great Royalist perished in the service of the Cross, as, it will be remembered, another Lord of Ellesmere had done be fore. Be that as it may, his feoffment of his brother in Ellesmere was clearly ultra vires ; and the difficulties which Roger le Strange had in obtaining possession, extended to his better title in respect of Coolmere and Hampton. In November 1274, Ellesmere was as yet in the hands of Edward I. His Escheator for Cheshire (Adam de Chetwynd) had custody of the Castle, and, as the Pimhill Jurors alleged, had appropriated 100 shillings' worth of timber, which was provided for building (or rebuilding) the said Castle, to his own use, carrying it to his own house at Aldredescote. The same Jurors complained that the men of Ellesmere did not render suit before the King's Justices, as they had been used to do down to the time of Roger de Thurkelby's Eyre,2 and as other Royal Manors did.3 In 1276 (as we have seen under Coolmere4) Ellesmere was settled by King Edward on Sir Roger le Strange for life, with remainder to the Crown. On October 28, 1280, Ellesmere, like other estates of this Baron, was minutely surveyed by Commissioners. Their Report (so far as it is legible) contains many curious particulars, and some idea of the great extent of territory implied by the words \" Manor and Hundred of Ellesmere.\" The Ellesmere virgate seems to have consisted of 81 acres. The Lord of the Manor held 4 vir gates or 324 acres in demesne, worth, at Ad. per acre, \u00a36. Os. 8d. per annum. The Fines and amercements of the Borough-Court exceeded 30s. There was an Assize on every brewing of beer, realizing 20s. yearly. Two Mills, the Fishery of all the Vivaries, except that of Coolmere, and a garden, were items of demesne. 1 Rot. Patent. 51 Hen.

It was found that Herdewyk contained 4 virgates, value 20s., less 6s. 8d. payable to the Lord of Ellesmere ; and that Merton contained 4 virgates, value 16s., less 6s. 8d. payable to the same Lord.2 The reason of the above inquiry appears in two Patents of May 9, 1284. The King con firms Roger le Strange's feoffments of Robert Body in 4 virgates at Hardwick, and of Philip, son of Robert de Say, in 4 virgates at Marton, and 10 acres at Horton. These estates had previously been tenanted by Madoc ap Yareford, Wyn Vaghan, Gurgenew Vaghan, Lewellyn ap Willym, Lonhargh ap Ryrit, Kenewrech ap Lonhargh, Ener ap Wyon, Griffit Gogh, Eynon Seys, Yevan ap Yarford, Madoc ap Yarforth, and other Welshmen, adherents of Lewellyn and Rebels against King Edward. On their forfeiture, it is obvious that Roger le StraDge, as life-tenant of Ellesmere, could make no title-in-fee for any new tenants, except with consent of the King, as Reversioner. On March 11, 1309, King Edward II. orders Roger le Strange to facilitate another Royal Commission for taking an Extent of the Manor of Ellesmere. A Jury which assembled on March 24, included John le Clerk of Croulesmere, William de Othale, Edenevet de Gesnok, and William le Wolf. The sum total of their extent, or valuation, was \u00a396. 17s. 7\\d. per annum, showing how greatly the value of such property had in creased since the conquest of Wales. A few of the details of this Survey are worth transcribing.- \u2014 The Castle itself was of no value beyond the cost of its maintenance : the boses of Kenewykeswode aud Northwude, and the moor of Leyemor, were among the ap purtenances of the Manor; the Meres (siagna) of Ellesmere, Culghmere, Croulesmere, Swotlemere, Chetelmere, Poulesmere, Blake mere, and Whitemere, and other meres, with a weir at Warchet, were worth, in respect of the fishery thereof, \u00a313. 6s. 8d. per an num, and not more, because the tenants fished when they pleased, 1 Forest Roll, Salop, No. 14.

Croules mere, Kynewike, Tetneshull, Berche, Newenes, Othale, Lythe, Woctelee, Herdewike, Crikott, Ellesdene, Stokes, Rugg, Mayswyan, Luneyale, and Grenhulle. The custom, or due, called potura satel litum, payable by certain tenants in time of peace, was worth \u00a35. 6s. 8d. per annum ; but it was not levied in wartime, being then involved in the general obligation to victual the Castle-guards.1 Roger le Strange died (as we have seen) on July 31, 1311 ; and of course Ellesmere instantly reverted to the Crown. On February 14, 1319, the King orders John de Bromfeld and Roger Karles to inquire concerning ivustes and assarts in Ellesmere, viz. as to all grants, in fee, or for terms of life, made thereof by the late Roger le Strange.2 The Inquest, which followed, resulted in a Patent of May 28, 1319, addressed to the above two Commissioners and to Richard Hord. Roger le Strange had made many such grants for his life, viz. 9\\ acres to William de Othale at ld. per acre, 2\\ acres to Robert, Chaplain of Hampton, at a rent of 16d., &c. &c. The Commissioners are to convert all such arrentations into hereditary feoffments, and cause the said rents to be paid to John de Knokyn, who had already a grant of Ellesmere from the Crown, to hold for his life.3 John de Knokyn, thus favoured, was living in March 1316, and was then Lord of Faintree, near Bridgnorth, and Fer mor of the Staffordshire Hundred of Pirehill. A Writ of Feb. 14, 1322, shows that Oliver de Ingham was then \" Custos of the King's land of Ellesmere.\" He was required to raise 100 foot-soldiers from the Lordship of Ellesmere. Subse quently he appears as Justice of Chester, and as invested with trusts of far greater importance. On Feb. 16, 1330, King Edward III. gave the Manor of Over ton (Flintshire), the land of Mailorseisnek, the Manor of Graun cestre, and the Manor and Castle of Ellesmere, with the hamlets of Colmare and Hampton, to Eubolole Strange and his wife Alice;4 1 Inquisiliones ad quod damnum, 2 Edw. IL, No. 122. and widow of Thomas Plantagenet, Earl of Lancaster (executed in 1321). Alice, whilst single, had given several castles and estates to Edward II. and to the two Despencer6, all which had now devolved to Edward III., by inheritance from his father, or by forfeiture of the Despencers. It was because Eubolo le Strange was a valued servant of Edward III., and bc- 2 Ad quod damnum, 12 Edw. II. No. 126. 3 Patent. 12 Edw. IL, pars. 2, m. 9 dorso. 4 Rot. Chartarum, 5 Edw. III., No. 83.

This Eubolo died in 1335, without issue. Ellesmere then went to his Nephew Roger, son of his elder Brother John le Strange (VI) of Knokyn, which Roger was already Baron of Knokyn, by death without issue of his elder brother, \u2014 John le Strange (VII). Roger le Strange (I), Baron of Knokin and of Ellesmere, was deceased on August 10, 1349. The Inquest, taken soon after wards, found him to have held the Fortalice and Hundred of Elles mere, in capite of the King, by service of one-twentieth of a knight's fee!1 Roger le Strange (II), of Knokyn and of Ellesmere, having been born on Feb. 2, 1326, was 23 years of age at his Father's death. I have only to add that Ellesmere continued with the Barons Strange of Knokyn till their heir general carried it to the Stanleys. Now, the Baronies of Knokyn and of Ellesmere, as well as that of Stanley, are in abeyance between the descendants and representatives of the three daughters and coheirs of Ferdinando Stanley, fifth Earl of Derby of his line. ELLESMERE CHURCH. The mention of two Priests in the Domesday Survey of Ellesmere, indicates not merely the pre-existence of a Church, but that, after the usual manner of Saxon Churches, it was collegiate. Subsequent evidences prove that it remained so till the 13th century. We have seen Reyner, Parson of Ellesmere, alias Reyner, Clerk, attesting about 1195 the two Deeds of David ap Owen and Owen ap David, the successive Lords of Ellesmere.3 This Reiner was only a Por tioner of Ellesmere. On August 30, 1214, King John, by Letters Patent presents William de Haverhull to that Prebend in the Church of Ellesmere which Reiner de Ellesmere had previously held, and which was in the King's Presentation. The Bishop Elect of Co- cause he and his wife had quitclaimed the above Castles and estates to the King, that he thus granted Ellesmere and many other estates (enumerated more fully by Dug dale, Baronage, p. 668), to Eubulo and Alice and the heirs of Alice, to hold by the service of two knights'-fees. There were other Manors also, which Edward II. had given to Alice for her life only. These Edward III. now settled on her, and her husband, and on her husband's heirs, to hold as fully as the Earl of Lin coln held them. A difficulty, which remains, is this, viz. that (as we shall see in the text) Ellesmere eventually went to the heirs of Eubolo le Strange, and not to the heirs of Alice. 1 Inquisitions, 23 Edw.

One Geoffrey resigned it in the year 1205. Osric, or Ostric, or Instructus, the Chief Clerk of Lewellyn ap Jor werth, then Lord of Ellesmere, was at the time an Annuitant of King John, with a promise of Church preferment. On December 29, 1205, the King presents \" Astruc, Clerk of our beloved Lew elyn,\" to the vacant Prebend of Ellesmere, in lieu of the said As truc's previous annuity of 100s.2 We have seen that in November 1221, though Lewellyn was Lord of Ellesmere, the Church, worth 20 merks per annum, was held to be of the King's Advowson.8 It was nevertheless within the next four years that Lewellyn, either obtaining or usurping a right to this Advowson, granted it to the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusa lem, located at Dongelwal in North Wales.

The Taxation of 1291 makes the Vicarage of Ellesmere (in the Deanery and Archdeaconry of Salop) to be worth \u00a35 per annum} On December 10, 1316, King Edward IL, then at Clipston, re- ceiving a Fine of \u00a320 from the Hospitallers, inspected and con firmed the grant of Ellesmere Church made to them by Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, in 1225.2 The Survey of the Hospitallers' Estates, taken in 1338, contains the following items under the Bailiwick of Halston : \u2014 Assized rents within the Hundred of Ellesmere ...\u00a3400 The Church of Ellesmere, worth yearly \u00a346 13 4 Here doubtless we have the impropriated glebe and tithes of the ancient College.3 According to the Inquisition of the Ninth, taken in 1341, Elles- mere with most of its members was then reputed to be in Wales, and so exempt from the current impost. Four hamlets in the Parish were however assessable, and the Commissioners taxed them at \u00a34. 6s. 8c?., and not more, because of a general murrain which had devastated the sheepfolds. The hamlets in question were Franketon (English Frankton), Colende (read Colemere), Leghe (Lea), and Hampton (Welch Hampton).4 In 1348 and 1349 King Edward III. confirmed the Hospitallers in their possession of this Church by two several Patents.5 The Valor of 1534-5 gives \u00a319 as the annual income of Roger Lee, Vicar of Ellesmere : which income was chargeable with 12s. for Procurations, and 10s. for Synodals.6 The contemporary value of the Rectory, still held by the Hospitallers, I have not been able to discover.

About Easter 1247 a Manor called Elleston seems to have been granted, at a fee-farm rent of 20s., to Wenunwin fitz Meuric by King Henry III. The Grantee was to be further liable to all other services pertaining to the estate. At Michaelmas 1248 he owed 30s. or 1 \\ years' arrears of this fee-farm rent ; and these arrears continued to accumulate till the Pipe-Roll of 10 Edward I. (1282) charges Wenunwine with \u00a335. 10s., or 35^ years' arrears, of the ferm of the Manor of Ellesdone. How much of these ac counts was mere fiscal routine I cannot say. We have seen that in 1280 Stephen de Franketon was the actual tenant of 4 virgates in Ellesdon, that his rent, for that and other lands, was 22s., but that it was payable, not at the Exchequer, but to the Lord of Ellesmere.1 Hence perhaps the superfluous entry on the Pipe-Rolls. Hardwick. We have seen that the four Welshmen who held Hardwick under the Lord of Ellesmere in 1280,2 had suffered for feiture in 1284, and their estates (4 virgates) were confirmed as a tenure-in-fee to one Robert Body.3 For further particulars about Robert Bodv, and his tenure in another part of Shropshire, I may refer back to the account of Stockton,4 sometime called Body-Stock ton, from its connection with this family.

At the Assizes of November 1221 it appeared that one William de Roshal had died seized of half a virgate in Lunyhal. His heirs were William, son of his sister Dionisia, and his sister Isabella, wife of William de Fontenay ; and to them did the Tenant, William fitz Gilbert, surrender the said land. At the same Assizes, Gilbert fitz Oviet, as heir of his Uncle (avunculi), William fitz Hemming, sued William de Hampton as oc cupant of a half-virgate in Lunehal. By a Fine, forthwith levied, Gilbert fitz Oviet quitclaims his right for half a merk. In 1280 Lunyal, as we have seen, was one of the largest members of Elles mere, and then held by a female.2 In December 1291 Stephen de Lunehall occurs on a Besford Jury. Old Marton. We have seen that Marton, a member of Elles mere, was held by Welshmen in 1280,2 who being ejected, the estate was conferred on Philip, son of Robert de Say, at a rent of 6s. 8d. This was in 1284. On November 28, 1327, it was found by In quest to be non-injurious to the Crown, if Philip de Say were to en feoff John de Leyborne in the Manor of Marton. It was held in capite of the Manor of Ellesmere, at a rent of 2s. Its value to the Tenant was 50s. Philip de Say had no other lands.3 Oteley. David de Otley was among the Ellesmere Tenants of 1280. At the Assizes of 1292 David de Ottle was one of the Jurors for Pimhill Hundred. Early in the next century we have repeated mention of William de Otley. According to the Inquest of March 24, 1309, his position was a good one. He held half a knight's-fee of the Chatellany of Ellesmere in \" Otlee, Hoghton, and Walton, on the borders of Shropshire.\" The estate was worth 40s. per annum. His service was to guard one of the Towers of Ellesmere Castle in wartime at his own charges.4 From this William there is good reason to believe that the Otleys of Pitchford were descended.

The Pimhill Jurors then reported it as half a hide in Lega held in capite by the Abbot and by \" feoffment of Earl Roger.\" The Abbot, it seems, claimed to include the estate in his ordinary Franchises.2 Subsequent to this, I do not find any such mention of Lee as would tally with the idea of its remaining with the Abbey. Indeed the Inquest of 1280 exhibits it as held of the Lord of Ellesmere.3 As to the Tenants of Lee, I take it that Ralph de Lega, who at tests a Charter of Owen ap David, about 1200, was one. About 1230-40, \" Ralph de Lega gives to Reginald, son of his son Richard, three bovates in the vill of Lega, which he had in hand, and the service, due on a fourth bovate from WilHam, the Grantor's nephew, reserving a rent of Ad. to the Grantor, and all services due to the Abbot of Shrewsbury.

Domesday in short would indicate that Earl Roger's policy in the Marches was not only very successful, but much more conciliatory than other Records would suggest. As to Robert, the Domesday Tenant of part of Ness, his feoff ment I will attempt to identify when I come to speak of the mem bers of the Manor. The early history of the Manor itself, chiefly consists in what is known of the Church and its transfer to Shrews bury Abbey. These particulars have been detailed under Middle ;2 and their perfect consonance with Domesday is once more a tribute to the veracity of the Shrewsbury Chartulary. The four Berewicks of Ness, alluded to in Domesday, were, I suppose, Kinton, Willcot, Hopton, and Weston Lullingfield. King's Ness (as in the second phase of its history this Manor was aptly called) came to the hands of King Henry II. as a Manor of Royal demesne. In the Firma Comitatus it seems to have been reputed as a Manor of 7 librates, but afterwards its fiscal value was \u00a37. 10s. In the Pipe-Roll of 1156 (2 Hen. II) we find that Henry II. had made a pr\u00e6stitum, that is, I suppose, a temporary grant, of 7 librates of Crown -land to one Cadwallader. The same Cadwallader stands similarly endowed on the Pipe-Roll of 1157. This slight allusion of two Exchequer-Rolls shall be the text for a page of contemporary history. \u2014 Cadwallader, second son of Gruffyth ap Conan, Prince of North Wales, was brother of Owen Gwyneth, who ruled that country from 1137 to 1169. Before Owen's accession to the throne, that is, in the year 1136, he and his brother Cadwallader had joined in that daring attempt to expel the English from Wales, which resulted, if in nothing else, yet in the death of Pagan fitz John, the Sheriff of Shropshire and the Scourge of the Borders.3 In the year 1142 Owen Gwyneth and Cadwallader were at variance, and Aberystwith Castle, a stronghold of Cadwallader, was burnt by Owen. Their reconciliation was effected; but in 1145 Howel and Conan, sons of Domesday, fo. 253, b, 2. 2 Supra, pages 68-70. 3 Supra, Vol. V. p. 242."], [721, "257 GREAT NESS. Owen, were at deadly feud with their Uncle. Their quarrel lasted for four years till, in 1149, Prince Howell got hold of the person of Cadwallader and consigned him to a dungeon. In 1151, says the Welsh Chronicle, \"Cadwalader, the brother of Prince Owen, es caped out of his Nephew Howel's prison and subdued part of the Ile of Mon, or Anglesey, to himselfe ; but his brother Owen sent an armie against him, and chased him thence, who fled to England for succour to his wife's friends, for she was the daughter of Gilbert Earl of Clare.\"1 With the exception of one inaccuracy, this story is remarkably confirmed by a totally independent document. Between the years 1151 and 1152 Ranulf, Earl of Chester (that Ranulf who died by poison in 1153) confirmed the Monks of Shrewsbury in the posses sion of all their lands between the Ribble and the Mersey. The Earl's Charter is dated at Chester, and attested as follows. \u2014 Testi bus, Comite de Clara, et Cadwaladro, Rege Waliarum, et Roberto Basset, et Ganfrido Dispensario.2 The Earl of Clare here alluded to, was Gilbert. He was Nephew of Earl Ranulph himself, and, in the year 1146, had been given up to Stephen as a hostage for his Uncle's good faith aud allegiance. His flight from Stephen's Court is recorded by the Chroniclers. It is evident that he took refuge with his Uncle. He died, in 1152, without issue, and was succeeded by his brother Roger. This fact, as well as a comparison of dates and ages, will show that Cadwal lader's wife, Alice, was a Sister of Earl Gilbert and a daughter of Earl Richard de Clare, and, finally, a niece of Ranulph, Earl of Chester. A Prince of North Wales (a King he styles himself) thus allied to the English, and thus hostile to Owen Gwyneth, might well claim the consideration of Henry II. when, in 1154, the latter ascended the throne. The Shropshire Pipe-Rolls have supplied us above with one phase of the alliance between Henry and Cadwallader. The Chronicles supply another.\u2014 In July and August, 1157, Henry was invading Wales. The King, says my authority, \" was there unto procured and moved by Cadwalader, whom the Prince his brother had banished out of the land and bereaved of his living.\" Kin\u00b0- Henry's first campaign against Wales has been described as unfortunate in its details. It certainly ended in the disgrace of Henry de Essex, the Constable of England, on a charge of cowar dice /it also ended in a pacification with Owen Gwyneth, who con- i Powel's Chronicle, p. 148.

Henceforth we hear no more of Cadwallader as in the pay of King Henry. For a time he remained in alliance with the English, as when, in 1159, he assisted the Earls of Clare and of Bristol to relieve Carmarthen, then besieged by Prince Rese of South Wales. He was also a munificent Benefactor to Haughmond Abbey. In 1165 he is found leagued with Owen Gwyneth against the English, and probably retained that adverse position till his death in 1172. Again recurring to those grand tests of the veracity of Chronicles, the Pipe- Rolls of Henry II.'s reign, I find that in the Roll of 1158 the entry about Cadwallader is discontinued, and we have in its place the following. \u2014 In terris datis. Et Johanni Extraneo \u00a37. 10s. de preestito Regis, per breve Regis. This is repeated in the Roll of 1159, but in the Roll of 1160 the corresponding entry is. \u2014 Et Johanni Extraneo \u00a37. 10s. de pr\u00e6stita Regis in Nesse. Et eidem \u00a34 in Chesewurda. The meaning of this is that Ness was given to John le Strange in 1157-8, and in succession to Cadwallader, and that Cheswardine became his in 1159-60 as heir of his brother Hamo. The words de pr\u00e6stita Regis were applied to the grant of Ness for years after. They imply no qualification of an absolute grant-in-fee ; but were, I suppose, inadvertently copied from the entries of 1156 and 1157. Thus did John le Strange become Tenant-in-capite of Ness and Cheswardine, two Manors whose collective fiscal value was \u00a311. 10s. His return, as a Tenant-in-capite, is preserved in the Liber Niger or Feodary of 1165. It runs as follows. \u2014 Johannes Extraneus tenet de Rege Nessarn et Cheswrthe per servitium unius militis et dimidii.1 It was Ness which was held by the whole fee, and Cheswardine which was held by the half-fee. All subsequent Records confirm the above account of John le Strange's Tenure; for instance, the Feodary of 1240, speaking of his Grandson, says, \u2014 Johannes Extraneus tenet l^f. m. in Chese wardin et Nesse, in capite de Rege.2 The testimony of the Scutage- Rolls is in exact accordance, as the following Summary will suffi ciently show. \u2014 1194.

I should now redeem a former promise, and devote a large space to the origin and early history of \u2014 THE HOUSE OF LE STRANGE. I have suggested in a former Volume that the paternal Ancestor of this great and numerous family was Ruald, or Roland, Extra neus, living in the time of King Henry I.4 This idea is confirmed by a Deed of John le Strange (IV) of Knokyn, which has recently come to light, and in which he confirms certain land in Hunstanston to the descendant of one who had been originally enfeoffed by \" Roland le Strange, the Confirmant's ancestor.\"5 Now this Con firmation passed between the years 1269 and 1275 j and, whereas the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of the Confirmant were all named John, it follows that Roland must have been a more remote ancestor. Whereas also the first John le Strange appears in public life as early as 1155, it follows that Roland must have lived at least as early as the reign of Henry I. Roland le Strange may therefore be surely identified with him who attested Alan fitz Flaald's Deed about 1112 ;6 and with that Tenant of a Knight's-fee in the Norfolk Honour of Mileham, 1 This was a Fine or composition, rather than an assessment by rate. 2-3 Theae twojassessments are lower than the current rate. * Supra, Vol. III. p. 125. 5 Deed'in possession of H.

As to the story that the Stranges were paternally descended from John, or any more real Duke or Earl of Brittany, that has been already dismissed as part of a ridiculous fable.1 But there is an other allegation, that all the Stranges were descended from some Siward. This is one of those bare and unsupported assertions which we cannot test by circumstances, and to contradict which, is something like undertaking to prove a negative. Siward is a Saxon name, or rather a name of Danish origin, freely used among the English Saxons. Allowing that Roland le Strange of Henry I.'s time may possibly have been son or descendant of some Si ward,2 we cannot but conclude that the said Roland was the only proved paternal ancestor, and was the father of those four Brethren, John, Guy, Hamo, and Ralph, who came or had come into notice at the period of Henry II.'s accession.3 1 Supra, Vol. III. p. 123. Wellingham, Sutton, Bittering, Lytcham, Mileham, Stanford, Titeshale, and Wesen ham. 2 I do not offer this as an hypothesis of my own, but in deference to an ancient though rather loose tradition. My own conviction is that Siward, or Suwold, was ancestor of a family of Stranges totally distinct from that under notice, and usu ally styled \" of Lytcham.\" A confusion between the two races was more than ordinarily probable, seeing that both held under Fitz Alan, and that both had an interest in Lytcham. The following I conceive to be the early descent of Strange of Lytcham. \u2014 3 These Volumes were far advanced, when I discovered a Deed in the Castle- Acre Chartulary (Harl. MS. 2110, fo. 28), which settles decisively that Eoland le Strange was father of John le Strange (I) and his three brothers. This invaluable document, which we must date between 1157 and 1160, runs as follows. \u2014 \" Seiant presentes et futuri quod ego Jo hannes Extraneus dedi Deo et Sanct\u0153 Ma ri\u00e6 de Acra et monachis ibidem Deo servi enlibus VI acras terr\u00e6 in campo de Lucheam, in fine cnltur\u0153 de Melegrene, in liberam et perpetuam elemosynam pro salute anim\u0153 pa tris mei Rollandi et Matild\u0153 matris me\u00e6 et Hamonis fratris mei et me\u00e6 et h\u00e6redum meorum et omnium parentum meorum.

Durandus le Strange, by his wife, Agnes, had a son Ralph, who was also called Le Strange, and was living from 1180 to 1217. John le Strange, son of Ralph, occurs from 1240 to 1292. He had by his wife, Isabella, two sons, John and Ralph. John (the elder son) died May 31, 1305, without issue. Ralph, his bro ther and heir, was living in 1310. \u2014 The property of this branch of the Stranges consisted of the Lordship over the two Norfolk Hundreds of Launditch and South- Greenhow, and of lands in I forbear pointing out or recalling the many previous conjectures, about persons,"], [725, "261 HOUSE OF LE STRANGE. But the tenure of a single Norfolk fee by Roland le Strange was insignificant, and it is not for any paternal ancestry of the Stranges that we must look, if we wish to account for their great ascendency. As a race they were distinguished for their abilities in field and in council. They were distinguished yet more for the most stead fast loyalty. The feoffments of John, Guy, and Hamo le Strange, by Henry fitz Empress, and William fitz Alan (I), were tributes to men of ascertained ability. For three long-lived and successive generations, the Heads of this House were indefinitely trusted by contemporary Kings. For the same period no Le Strange ever betrayed such trust, or was suspected of betraying it. But, besides all this, there was a territorial influence which ac crued to this family, at an early period, and by hereditary descent, which has hitherto escaped our notice. Maternally, the Stranges of Henry II.'s time could trace an ancestry of three generations, and the ulterior result to the elder brother, John, was a great ter ritorial aggrandizement. I have said that the Mother of John le Strange (I) was a Suffolk lady, but not an heiress} I have also said or implied that John le Strange (I) inherited his Norfolk Fee, Hunstanston, from his Father. This I find, though verbally true, to be far less than the truth, and calculated to mislead. John le Strange's Mother was not indeed an heiress herself, but in her issue she was a very great heiress. She would better have been called a Norfolk, than a Suffolk, Lady. Again it was only a part of Hunstanston, which John le Strange inherited from his father and held under Fitz Alan. Having offered these preliminary ex planations, I may now proceed with those facts and probabilities which constitute the maternal origin of the House of Le Strange. \u2014 The \u00e6ra of Hugh de Plaiz, a Suffolk Feudatory, must be estimated as little, if at all, later than Domesday. It is probable that Ralph de Plaiz, who between the years 1107 and 1120 granted lands to Thetford Priory,2 was son and heir of Hugh. It is also probable that Ralph de Plaiz, who lived in 1194, was the then representative of this family. But, besides his supposed son (Ralph), Hugh de Plaiz had a daugh ter, Helewise. This Helewise had the land of Bernham (Suffolk) 2 Monasticon, Vol. V. 148. ii. I think that Ralph de Plaiz was identical with that Ralph fitz Hugh to whom the first William de Albini gave two knights'-fees in Norfolk, and in the time of Henry I.

This Ralph was living in 1086, and was then a Vassal of Roger Bigot. The Norfolk Domesday records for instance under the Terra Rogeri Bigot, that Radulf fitz Herluin holds two carucates in Hunestatuna, and four carucates in Totintun.1 I imagine that Ralph fitz Herluin's fee was afterwards greatly increased, and that he held the greater part of Hunstanston, and several other Manors in Norfolk, under William de Albini Pincerna, a Minister and favourite of King Henry I. The mode in which Albini acquired or realized his Norfolk Fief (of 62 knights'-fees) was as follows. \u2014 Henry I. gave him the Fee of Corbuchiun, consisting of 15 knights'-fees. The King next gave him 10 knights'-fees in the Fief of Roger Bigod, in marriage with Ma tilda, daughter of the said Roger Bigot. Then the same King gave him other 17 fees. Lastly, Albini himself enfeoffed 20 knights in his own demesnes.2 We have no list of the 25 fees which together constituted the Fief of Corbuchiun and the marriage portion of Maud Bigot. Had we such a list, I can have little doubt that either Ralph de Hunstanston or one of his sons would appear therein as Tenant of 5 fees. Ralph de Hunstanston had three children, viz. Simon, Reginald, and a daughter unnamed.3 Simon succeeded his father before 1135, and died without issue. Reginald succeeded his brother Simon. He was called Reginald le Brun. Under that name, and between the years 1154 and 1173 he gave the land of Bernham, above mentioned, to Thetford Priory. Reginald le Brun died without issue, before 1174. His heir was his Nephew, John le Strange, the eldest son of his Sister, which Sister I take to have been wife of Roland le Strange. If what I have surmised above be as correct as what I have stated, it will follow that, about the year 1170, \u2014 John le Strange (I) held 5 knights'-fees in Hunstanston and elsewhere in Norfolk, under William de Albini Pincerna (II), that is, under William Earl of Arundel, surviving husband of the Dowa ger Queen Adeliza. One of the estates which John le Strange thus held of the Earl was part of Edgefield, in the Hundred of Holt (Co. Norfolk) . The Deed whereby John le Strange gave this estate to Binham Priory proves so much of what has been asserted above, as to his maternal ancestry and his Norfolk tenure, that I give it here. \u2014 1 Domesday, fos. 173-b, 174-a.

Jan. 16, 1174), who \"at the petition of John le Straunge \" recited and confirmed it.6 I cannot close this digression without noticing that Simon fitz Ralph (John le Strange's maternal uncle) had long before conceded this land of Egeffeld to Binham Priory, but at a rent of 12d. The concession was certified and confirmed by William de Albini (I), his wife Matilda, aud his son William, in a Deed which addresses all the Confirmant's Barons, and is expressed to be for the soul of Roger Bigot and of his wife.\"7 Now as Roger Bigod died in 1107, and as William de Albini (I) died before Stephen's accession, we cannot doubt that this last transaction took place between 1107 and 1135.

Church of St. Mary of Hunstanston to the Shropshire Abbey of Haughmond. The grant was attested by Andrew, Abbot of Wig more, by the Abbot of Buildwas, and by John le Strange, a Canon.1 The grant was confirmed by King Henry II. about 1176,3 and by John, Bishop of Norwich, in a dated manifesto of 1178, in which the Grantor is styled \" dilectus filius noster, vir honorabilis Johan nes Extraneus.\" In another Charter the same Prelate allows the Canons of Haghmon to appropriate this Rectory, saving the life interests therein of William de Bruna and Roland, Clerks. Only one of John le Strange's Charters mentions the name of his wife. It was Hawise. The Charter was a grant to Haghmon Abbey, already alluded to under Webseott.3 It is probable that it was made on the death of his said wife, which will have shortly preceded his own death. The latter event took place in 1177-78. At Michaelmas 1178 Guy le Strange, Sheriff of Shropshire, had in hand the reputed issues of Ness and Cheswardine, obviously because his brother's Son had not obtained livery ; but before Michaelmas 1179 he had handed over the sum to \"John, son of John le Strange.\" Of Guy, Hamo, and Ralph, brothers of John le Strange (I), I have spoken under Alveley, Cheswardine, Little Ercall, and numer ous other localities. He left issue, at least four sons, viz. John, Ralph, Hamo, and William. I now proceed with the eldest, viz. \u2014 John le Strange (II), who in his father's lifetime had frequently appeared attesting Charters of, or with, his Father. The next ap pearance of this John le Strange, after his father's death, was in connection with Hulm or Holme, a considerable Manor in Norfolk, which he held under the Earl of Arundel, and which adjoined Huns tanston. The Advowson of the Church of Hulm was in dispute between the Abbot of Ramsay and John le Strange. A Fine was levied at Westminster on November 13, 1188, before John Bishop of Norwich and Ranulf de Glanvill, Justices, and before Godfrey de Luci, and Ralph, Archdeacon of Hereford, whereby the Abbot quit claimed the said Advowson to John le Strange. Tn return, the Bishop of Norwich, by John le Strange's consent, charged an an nual pension of one merk, payable to the Abbot of Ramsay by every future Presentee of the Living.4 John Bishop of Norwich confirmed the above arrangement in one Deed. In another he institutes William le Brun (of whom we have heard before) in the Church of Hulm, at the presentation of 1 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 121. 5 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 293. 3 Supra, page 76, note. 4 Lilleshall Chartulary, fos. 80, 55."], [731, "267 HOUSE OF LE STRANGE.

The Pipe-Roll of 1194 shows that the Liveries of the Knights and Servientes who guarded the said Mines had been paid by the Sheriff, after a report, or representation, made by John and Ralph le Strange. I now turn again to the Eastern Counties for a piece of genealo gical information which has already been used in this narrative. \u2014 A Plea-Roll of June 1194 fixes July 1st as the day \"on which the Prior of Thetford and John le Strange were to attend at Westmin ster and receive their Chyrograph.\" An entry on a Plea- Roll of November 1 194 shows Martin Prior of Thetford arid John le Strange in attendance. They had had a suit wherein the Prior had claimed a carucate of land in Berneham against John le Strange. John, not having the land in his possession, and being at present unable to recover it from the holder, but being also bound to warrant it to the Prior, was obliged to come to a conditional agreement. \u2014 The Prior quitclaimed his right in Bernham, and John gave in lieu thereof 20 solidates of land and 3 natives in Tottinton.4 For this Concord the Prior gave Le Strange 100s. ; but it was stipulated that, if Le Strange could recover Bernham, the Prior was to have it, and not only restore the premises in Tottinton, but pay another 100s. to Le Strange.5 We must remember that this very land of Bernham had been given by Hugh de Plaiz to his daughter, Helewise, when she mar- (Norfolk):\u2014 north of Thetford.

He recognized the obligation, and was actually endeavouring in this very month of November 1194 to obtain possession of Bernham from Ralph de Plaiz, who had seized it (I presume) as right heir of Hugh de Plaiz above mentioned.1 This cross-suit was prosecuted by Simon de Pierpoint (a Shropshire Tenant of Le Strange) on be half of his Suzerain. He deduced Le Strange's descent and title in a way which makes one or two verbal inaccuracies of the Law scribe easy to amend. The result was, however, unfavourable to Le Strange; for Ralph de Plaiz evaded the Suit by a Plea that Ralph, his Nephew, was seized of the land. The Nephew had in turn a subterfuge; and John Le Strange was told to take out a new Writ, if he pleased. It would seem that he did so. for in De cember following a Suit was pending between Ralph de Plaiz and Robert (read John) le Strange. Of the final result I know nothing. About this time Robert Mortimer (of Attilbergh, I suppose) seems to have contested the whole Norfolk feoffment of John le Strange under the Earl of Arundel. The result was a Fine, levied, says my authority,2 in 1195, whereby Robert Mortimer quitclaimed to John le Strange five knights'-fees in Hunstanton, Ringstead, Snelleston, and Tottington. In return, John le Strange gave to Mortimer certain lands in Tottington, to hold under the Grantor by nineteen-twentieths of a knight's-fee. In 1196, we are told that John le Strange, with the assent of Robert de Mortimer, gave the Church of Tottington to the Priory and Nuns of St. Mary of Campesse (Suffolk).3 About 1 198 we have seen John le Strange and his brother Ralph attesting a Deed of Robert Corbet of Caus.4 For the trust and favour with which King John continually re garded this John le Strange, I may refer to my accounts of Wrock wardine and Cheswardine. A few minor indications of this confi dence may be added here. On May 25, 1212, Reginald de Heidin (Hesding), Constable of Oswestry, is ordered to transmit to the King, by hand of John le Strange, the moneys received for the sale of those stores of the King which were at Oswestry.3 On July 6, 1 Supra, page 261. 2 Parkins's Norfolk, Vol. X. p. 321. 3 BlomefieWs Norfolk (edit, of 1805), Volume II. page 355. 4 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 18. 6 Rot.

Le Strange is to inform the King how far the execution of this order can be depended on.1 Iu August 1212 John le Strange, being in custody of the escheated estates of Robert de Girros, is ordered to hand them over to Thomas de Er dinton.2 On September 24, 1212, Erdinton is ordered to give to William, Earl Ferrers, certain swine which John le Strange had caused to be fed for the Earl's use.3 In August 1214 we have seen, under Stanton Hineheath, that John le Strange employed his eldest son as a confidential messenger to the King's Court.4 John le Strange's exemption from the Scutage of Poitou in 1214, was because his son was in actual service there.5 A Patent of June 10, 1213, appoints John le Strange Governor of Carrechova Castle. On July 25, 1216, he had a grant of the Manor of Kidderminster, to hold during the King's pleasure.6 On September 5, 1216, King John, then at Oxford, appoints him Sheriff of Shropshire and Staf fordshire ; but so great, apparently, were the exigencies of the pe riod, that the Earl of Chester, who had been appointed to the same office in the preceding month, soon resumed it. Faithful to King John in the last extremity, this Baron's services are recognized by Letters of King Henry III., dated October 30, 1217, and exempting him from scutage in Shropshire, Suffolk, and Norfolk.7 The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1218 takes, however, no notice of this exemption. On March 25, 1218, the King orders him to have an auxilium from the Counties of Shropshire and Staf fordshire to enable him to strengthen his Castle of Knokyn.8 On June 7, 1218, he attended the dedication of Worcester Cathedral, the King himself being present thereat.9 Writs of May 1220 show him in charge of the Shropshire Forests.

His eleemosynary grants were very great. The Monasteries of Shrewsbury, Lilleshall, Wombridge, and above all, Haughmond, profited by his liberality. On that subject more will be found under the specific localities con cerned. I have been unable to ascertain the parentage of his wife Amicia, but some obscurity which has been added to this subject may be dispelled in a note.4 I have not found authentic mention of more than two sons of John le Strange (II). These were John, his successor, and Hamo. He had also a daughter, Margery, to whom, on her marriage with Ralph de Pichford, he gave land in Lytcham (Norfolk) .5 John le Strange (III) had entered on public life as early as 1212, and in 1214 had served in Poitou. At his Father's death he was already Lord of Wrockwardine. There are reasons for thinking that he is often mentioned during his father's lifetime, without being distinguished as Junior. In 1233 it would seem that he had custody of Montgomery Castle and of Sneth : for a Patent of June 14 orders him to place William de Boeles in that trust. A Patent of Feb. 6, 1234, shows him as Custos of a hostage, required by the Crown from his own Suzerain, John fitz Alan. On July 9, 1236, being certainly in office as Constable of Montgomery, he has the King's letters of protection from all Suits, &c. On October 26 of that same year, he was appointed to the greater trust or custody of the counties of Salop and Stafford : and on Nov. 14, Robert de la Haye (the late Sheriff) was enjoined to give up to his keeping the Castles of Shrews bury and Bridgnorth.

If the King should die at any time before John le Strange should have been relieved of his offices as Custos of the Castles of Montgomery, Shrewsbury, and Bridgnorth, and of the County of Chester, then the said John was to make them all over to the Queen for the use of Edward, the King's son. The above Patent of Dec. 3, 1240, was equivalent to appointing John le Strange to the high office of Justiciar of Chester. I have often explained that the King's chief representative in a Palatine County, held an office more analogous to that of Viceroy or Chief Justice, than to that of an ordinary Sheriff. A Patent of December 2, 1241, addresses John le Strange as Justice of Chester, empowering him to release some Welsh hostages, so soon as David ap Lewellyn should have sent others to replace them. On Feb. 25, 1242, John le Strange was commissioned to assess a tallage on the Royal demesnes of Shropshire and Staffordshire. At this time, and pending the minority of John fitz Alan (II), John le Strange was Custos of the Castles and Manors of Oswestry, Clun, Shrawardine, and Montford. The Pipe-Rolls are loaded with his various accounts. In March 1244, Ludlow Castle was, as we have seen, in his tempo rary keeping. Patents of July 1244, appoint him to settle terms of truce with David ap Lewellyn, and enjoin all the Lieges of Shrop shire, Staffordshire, and Cheshire, to put trust in him, as respected all measures for custody of the Marches. Here he is again styled Justice of Chester ; but before November 1245, John de Grey (al ready noticed under Ellesmere) had succeeded him in that office. On November 6, 1245, a Patent, dated at Lilleshull, proves that John le Strange was in the field rather than the Cabinet. Roger de Clifford, William de Odingsel, and others, are enjoined to abide under his command in the \" parts of Montgomery.\" In May 1248, I find evidence that John le Strange was no longer Custos of Mont gomery Castle. In that and in the following month he surrendered the Shrievalty of Shropshire and Staffordshire, and the Castles of Shrewsbury, Brug, and Ellesmere, to Thomas Corbet. His years alone are sufficient to account for this partial relaxation of his duties. As a Justice to settle important questions, and as a Negotiator, the King continued to employ him. In August 1253 one of his younger sons, Hamo, accompanied the King into Gascony. In 1254 he himself was appointed as a Justiciar to divide their inheritance among the heirs of William de Braose."], [736, "272 GREAT NESS.

He does no suit to Pimhill Hundred, but he does Suit to the County, for this, as for his other lands in Shrop shire. He holds a free Court and a franchise ; the Jurors know not by what title.\"1 The Shropshire Forest-Roll of February 1262 contains certain reminiscences of John le Strange and his sons, which show that the old man was a lover of the Forest and the Chase, and not very particular as to the example which he set in these matters of Royal Prerogative. \u2014 \" Sir John le Strange, Senior, did capture 3 stags and one doe (bissam) in the King's 40th year\" (1255-6). \" Hamo le Strange did capture one doe on September 8, 1257.\" \" Sir Hamo le Strange did capture one stag and one doe, on Sunday, Oct. 13, 1258. John le Strange, Junior, did capture two fallow-deer (damos) on Sept. 15, 1259.\" Meanwhile, the exigencies of the time, and the unlimited confi dence of the King, would seem to have recalled John le Strange to the sterner duties of his position as a Baron Marcher. \u2014 A Writ of the year 1260 announces breaches of truces and other excesses on the part of the Welsh, and \" John le Strange is to muster all his power and repair to the Border, and there remain for the se curity of those parts.\"2 Iu the same year Prince Edward appointed John le Strange, Junior, to the custody of Montgomery Castle, with a salary of 120 merks.3 This appointment was made probably on the presumption that the heir apparent of John le Strange (III) must needs be trustworthy ; but we shall see that in this instance the loyalty of the House was the appanage of a younger son. On November 12, 1261, John le Strange (Junior, I presume) is or dered by Patent to give custody of Montgomery Castle to John le Bretun, and John le Bretun is ordered incontinently to hand the said trust over to Hamo le Strange. A Patent of November 22, 1263, invests Hamo le Strange with custody of the Castles of Sa lop, Brug, and Montgomery,4 but I know not how it came to pass, in the case of Montgomery, that John le Strange is the person relieved from the previous trust.

His guilt, for guilt it must be called, is proved by two of those forged Patents which should stand in the name of Simon de Mont fort rather than of the King. Adam fitz Philip, on March 7, 1265, is ordered to surrender the custody of Montgomery Castle to John le Strange, Junior, and the latter, as soon as he has obtained the Castle, is ordered to come to the King to confer on matters of business ; \u2014 that is, to come to Simon de Montfort and plot treason. On April 2, 1265, another exhortation was addressed to Adam fitz Philip to surrender Montgomery Castle to John le Strange, Junior. The reason of this repetition is partly misrepresented by Dugdale. It was as follows. \u2014 Adam fitz Philip had been appointed Constable of Montgomery by Prince Edward, before the latter had been taken prisoner with his father. He had refused to obey the man date of March 7, without the Prince's special order. Young Le Strange had reported this difficulty to Montfort, and had procured the Writ of April 2nd, ordering Adam fitz Philip on his allegiance to surrender the Castle, and stating that this second order was given with Prince Edward's consent.1 And in truth it appears that a cor respondence had been going on between the King and Prince on this subject. The King had been made to threaten his son with the loss of his blessing, unless the son procured Adam fitz Philip's resignation.2 Dugdale's account of this episode would make it seem that the Prince was at large, and acted voluntarily on the occasion. It is clear that he was not at Westminster with his Father, but I imagine that he was under surveillance elsewhere. If the story be true which is related in the Welsh Chronicle, it would seem that John le Strange, Junior, actually became Con stable of Montgomery at this epoch, but had small joy of his po sition. In a midnight march through Keri, he was attacked by the Welsh, and 200 of his men were slain.3 This story must be collated with the known fact that the Welsh were leagued with Montfort and his partisans. It is singular that they should thus attack their own ally ; but the date of the event is not well marked in the Chronicle, and it may have arisen in some complications of which the Rolls do not inform us.

His younger son, Roeer, shared too in the spoils of the late Rebels, and on Hamo were showered the choicest rewards. Of his elder son we hear no more for the present. He was probably shielded from punishment by the great name which he bore. The Father died early in 1269, and on March 26 of that year the King, at Westminster, received the homage of John, his heir.1 The wife of John le Strange (III) was named Lucia. She is said to have been daughter of Robert de Tregoz.2 Besides his son and heir (John), John le Strange was father of at least three other sons, viz. Hamo, Roger, and Robert. Of these Hamo, Lord of Ellesmere and Stretton, became a Crusader, and died without issue, probably in the Holy Land. Roger was Lord of Cheswardine and eventually of Ellesmere. He also died without lawful issue. Ro bert was Ancestor of the House of Blackmere. John le Strange (III) had also two daughters, Alice and Hawyse. Of each of these Ladies I should say something here. \u2014 I have an extract of a Deed whereby, about 1260-1, \" John le Strange gives to his daughter, Alice, towards her marriage, half his Manor of Lucham (Lytcham, Norfolk) together with the Advowson of the Church.

I have already suggested that Hamo never returned, and I shall hereafter show that Hawise's interest in Stretton only expired with her life. Before we pass onward from the generation of John le Strange (III) , his eleemosynary Deeds require some notice. The Monasteries of Haughmond, Lilleshall, Wombridge, and Acornbury partook, more or less, of his bounty. Of his grants tq Wombridge and Haughmond I have spoken or shall speak under appropriate locali ties. His grant to Lilleshall was a mere Confirmation of the Ad vowson of Hulm, Norfolk.

There was an endowed Hospital at Nesscliff, in this Manor, aud, attached thereto, was a Chapel called The Church of St. Mary de Rocherio of Nesscliff; but the meaning of that appel lation escapes me. This institution we have seen benefited by the neighbouring Lord of Felton Butler. It was however in the pa tronage of the Stranges, and John le Strange (III), doubtless with a view to its efficiency, affiliated it on the Nunnery of Acornbury, with a largely increased endowment, and stipulating for the due performances of divine services in the aforesaid Chapel.

The Shropshire Inquest states that he had held 4 carucates in Kinton and Nesse of the King in capite by service of one knight's-fee. The whole estate was valued at \u00a310 per annum. John, his son and heir, was 22| years old.

We shall presently have proof that Joan de Somery survived John le Strange; and that, as a widow, her estates, inherited from Albini, were at her own disposal. In proceeding with a further account of Ness Strange and its Lords, I shall now confine myself to a few local or genealogical particulars. The later history of this powerful Baronial House, in its more important relations, is sufficiently notorious already. John le Strange (V) at once succeeded his father. On Ja nuary 10, 1276, King Edward I. excuses his beloved Valet, John le Strange, \u00a3200 of the debts of his Father and Ancestors. On June 1, 1276, a curious exchange, between Joan de Somery, of the one part, and John le Strange and his wife Alianore, of the other part, is recorded in the Plea-Rolls. Joan de Somery settles the Manor and Advowson of Midelton (Cambridgeshire) on John and Alianore, and the heirs of John by Alianore, but, in default of such heirs, with remainder to Joan. In return, John le Strange gives to Joan the value of half Midelton (to be taken out of his Manor of Hunstanston) and the Advowson of Hunstanston, and 100 solidates of lands and rents elsewhere, to hold to Joan for her life. If Hunstanston proved non-equivalent to half Midelton, the overplus, if any, was to remain with John le Strange, or the deficiency, if any, was to be made good to Joan out of Le Strange's nearest es tates. On Joan's death, and also on Alianore's death, without issue, Hunstanston was to revert to Le Strange. The Advowson and Capital Messuages of either Manor were to pass in exchange, as if equal, and were not to be extended.2 The Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 puts the service on Nesse as that of one knight for 15 days in time of war. The Feodary of 1284 gives the members of Ness and Kinton as Alreton, Hopton, and Wynelecote (Willcot).

This Maud must have been his second wife, and I cannot see how the settlement of 1276 on Alianore, his first wife, can have benefited Maud, unless some intermediate transaction had taken place. Be that as it may, Maud was (as Dugdale tells us) daughter and heir of Roger d'Eiville, and mother of the two sons of John le Strange (V). Of these, Eubolo, the second son, has been already noticed under Ellesmere ; while John, the eldest, was 27 years of age and more, in October 1309.

Roger, brother and heir of the deceased, was 22 years of age on August 15, 1322. A Writ of certiorari, dated August 28, 1323, caused a second Inquest to be held. This was in consequence of a complaint by Matilda, Avidow of the deceased, alleging her joint feoffment under the above deed in two-thirds of Ness, and in the reversion of one third after the death of Isolda, her late husband's mother. The petiton further stated Matilda's actual seizin, in conjunction with her husband, since the date of Emeric Pauncefot's feoffment. The second Inquest, now held, dated John le Strange's Deed a year and a half before his death (a loose statement), and added that Paunce fot's consequent seizin lasted forty days, that then he reinfeoffed John and Matilda ; \u2014 and so forth, as stated in Matilda's petition.1 The result of this probably was that Ness was carried by the widow, Matilda, to some second husband. It reverted however to the right heir before the death of Roger le Strange, son and heir of that Roger who succeeded to the other estates of the family in 1323. Of Undertenants in Ness Strange, as apart from its members, I have very little to say. Geoffrey, Clerk of Nesse, was a Juror for Pimhill Hundred at the Assizes of 1292. On October 4, 1320, an Inquest on the death of John de Knokyn (before mentioned under Faintree) was held at Ness. He was found to have held Faintree in capite, by Serjeantry.2 By a Fine, some time levied between the deceased and one Thomas de Eyton, he also held certain lands in Nesse under John le Strange of Knokyn, by service of two appearances yearly at the greater manorial Courts. This estate had been settled by the above Fine on John de Rous and Mable his wife, which Mable was daughter and coheir of the deceased, and aged 19 years on Feb. 2, 1320.

The Glebe, oblata, and small tithes, which went to swell the reputed value of the Church, had moreover nothing to do with an estimate of the Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb.\" Hence the reduction allowed by the Commissioners.2 It seems that the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury obtained an appropriation of this Church about the middle ofthe 15th century. I have no other record of the transaction than is implied by the subjoined list of Incumbents. A Rent-Roll of Shrewsbury Abbey, drawn up about 1490, gives the Rectorial tithes of Nesse as \u00a314. A Tenant in Little Ness also paid a modus of 6s. 8d. to the Abbey for the tithes of his wool and lambs. The Valor of 1535 puts the income of Thomas Battefeld, Vicar of Nesse- Strange, at \u00a39, clear of any standing charges.3 The Rec torial tithes, receivable by Shrewsbury Abbey, were put at \u00a312. 6s. 8d.3 The Abbot, as Rector of Ness, was chargeable with an annual pension of 13s. Ad. to the Bishop of Lichfield, with another of 10s. to the Archdeacon of Salop,3 and with a third of 6s. 8d. to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield.3 These were, I presume, in lieu of Sy nodals and Procurations, and in respect of the original appropriation having been allowed by the several Pensioners.

The site of Nesscliff Chapel is or was lately occupied by a School. An Inscription on the front of the said School embodied the tradi tion that a Chapel had once stood there, but as the Epigram was rather impious than apt, I need not record it.1 Hopton. This member of Ness is sometimes spoken of as a distinct manor. I know no more of its history than that the Abbot of Haughmond had some land there.2 WESTON LULLINGFIELD. The Domesday Manor of Ness was 5 hides. In 1255 it was reduced to 2 hides. There was some reason for this. It will hardly be sufficient to account for the discrepancy, if we repeat how Willcot and a part of Kinton had been alienated to Haghmon Abbey, or if we suggest that the Stranges may have subtracted portions of their Manor from English jurisdiction, and annexed them to the Wal cheria of Knokyn. One of the Domesday hides of Ness lay, I think, at a distance from the central Manor, and quite in another direction than would be calculated to throw it into Walcheria. It was in fact Weston Lullingfield. The Domesday Survey of Nesse speaks of some Welsh Tenants in the Manor, but speaks also of a \" certain Robertus whose four Undertenants were Villeins, and paid him 5s. rent.\"3 I venture to amplify this statement, and to suppose that it was Robert Pincerna who thus held Weston, an outlying member of Ness, and farmed it out to Villeins. We shall see (under Walford and Stanwardine) that the feudal position of Robert Pincerna was afterwards occupied by the successive Lords of the Honour of Montgomery. William de Cantilupe, Lord of Montgomery in 1254, was Mesne-Lord of Weston Lullingfield, holding under John le Strange of Ness, and over three Tenants in Coparcenery.\u2014 Thus the Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes the matter; the last century, being unendowed.\" 2 Supra, pp. 60, 114. 3 Supra, page 256. 1 Dean Woodhouse (then Archdeacon of Salop), in Ids Visitation of 1799, says that \" Nesscliff Chapel went to decay in"], [752, "288 GREAT NESS. not adverting however to William de Cantilupe's decease in the previous year. \u2014 \" Roger de Ondeslauwe, William de Hochton, and Adam de Chinnovere hold one hide in Weston, doing for Sir Wil liam de Cantilupe, in time of war, the service of one foot-soldier, with bow and arrows, for 40 days. Aud the said Tenants are to do suit to John le Strange's Court of Nesse. Weston is not geldable. It has a franchise, the Jurors know not by what warranty, unless it be under cover of the Franchise of John le Strange of Nesse aforesaid.\"1 This surmise of the Jurors was undoubtedly correct. What perplexed them was, that other Manors in their Hundred, which Cantilupe held in capite, had no such Franchise, and were geldable. We shall see under Stanwardine and Eyton that Sir William de Leighton was at this time interested in those localities. At the Assizes of 1256 he sued Roger de Ondesloue, William de Houhton, and Hugh de Hampton, for disseizing him of common pasture in 30 acres of moorland at Thakimor. The Defendants evaded the issue by pleading that Tackimor was no vill, but a place without buildings. The objection was fatal, but the Plaintiff had leave to amend his Writ. The following extracts relate partly to Weston Lullingfield, and partly to Petton. \u2014 About August 1256, Richard de Petton, Roger de Hundelawe (Onslow), and their fellows, fine 2 merks for some Assize to be had. On August 5, 1256, a Writ issued for trial of a case of disseizin, alleged by Roger (read Richard) de Petton and others against John le Strange, concerning common pasture in Goffles and Billemers (Bilmarsh), and concerning tenements in Petton, Weston, Sleap, and Burhton (Burleton). On Sept. 14, 1256, a Writ issued for trial of a disseizin, charged by Richard de Petton (alone) against John le Strange and others, concerning a tenement in Petton- Corstes. On Oct. 17, 1256, a similar Writ issued, for trial of a disseizin in Weston, charged by Roger de On deslawe against John le Estrange. I suppose that John le Strange had been using his paramount seigneury at Weston to the injury of Cantilupe's tenantry, there and at Petton, and for the advantage of his own Tenants at Middle. At the death of George de Cantilupe in 1273, Weston was put down among the Manors, held under him as Lord of Montgomery.

Wasta suit et est.2 It is probable that, soon after Domesday, Fennymere was given by one of the Norman Earls to Reiner the Provost. This Reiner, whom I take to be the earliest recorded Provost of Shrewsbury, conveyed the estate to Shrewsbury Abbey. King Henry I.'s Con firmation describes the grant as if it had been made in the time of one of the Norman Earls. At all events it was earlier than 1121, the year of Henry's Confirmation, which says \" Rainerius Prepositus (dedit) quandam terrulam cum lacu qui vocatur Finemera.\"3 We have other notices of Rainer the Provost. Between the years 1107 and 1123 he follows Richard, Bishop of London (then Viceroy of Shropshire) in attesting the Abbot of Shrewsbury's purchase of a house within Shrewsbury Castle, \u2014 \" the first house, or one of the first\" (says the Record) \"that was built there.\"4 About 1136, 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 122. The Record places Weston \" near Alberbury ;\" but this is only one of its many inaccuracies. - Domesday, fo. 259, b, 2. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 35. 4 Ibidem, No. 1. 37 X."], [756, "290 FENNYMERE. King Stephen's Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey tells us of Roger the Archdeacon and Reiner the Pr\u0153fect having attested a grant in the suburbs ; also of Reiner the Pr\u00e6fect himself having given land near Shrewsbury to the Abbey, on account of his Son, whom he had made a Monk. King Henry II.'s Confirmation describes this last grant as that of Reiner Pr\u00e6positus. Doubtless Reiner was a wealthy and influential personage, and presided over the Borough of Shrewsbury for a long series of years. However his grant of Fen nymere to the Abbey is only mentioned in Henry I.'s Confirmation. It probably was abortive, for Fennymere became annexed to the Fief of Fitz Alan. Fitz Alan's seigneury here, does not appear till a late period. Meantime the Records make unusually frequent allusions to the Tenancy. \u2014 At the Assizes of August 1226, Thomas de Linches and Emma his wife were found to have disseized Stephen fitz Warin and Alice de Fennimare of common pasture in Fennimare, pertain ing to their tenement in that vill. At the Assizes of 1256, it was alleged that one Edwin had held a virgate in Fennymare in the time of King Henry IL, that the said Edwin left a son and heir, Edwin, that the latter left a son and heir, Richard de Fennymare, and that Richard left a daughter and alleged heir, Isabella, who now claimed half the premises against Stephen fitz Warin, and half against Richard fitz Stephen, the existing occupants. \u2014 Stephen and Richard pleaded that Richard de Fennymare had also left a son, John, whose name was not inserted in the Plaintiff's case. This appears to have been true, and as we shall see, obliged the Plaintiff to amend her case. At the same Assizes, the two Defendants in the last suit were impleaded by Stephen de Asseford, for disseizing him of common pasture in Fenemere. The Defendants proved that they had assarted the common in question, by consent of the Lord of the Fee, before the Plaintiff had any tenement in the Manor. The Plaintiff was nonsuited, but his amercement was excused, at instance of Henry, son of the Earl of Cornwall. The Pipe-Roll of 1267 exhibits Isolda de Fennygmareis as owing a fine of half a merk for some Assize. This Isolda was the Isabella of the former suit. Her new grievance appears on the Plea- Roll of August 1267. As heir of her father, Richard de Fennemere, she sued Stephen de Asford for a third of 3 virgates in Fennemere. She recovered the claim, and John, son of Thomas de Asford, who appeared as Warrantor of Stephen's title, was ordered to give his Feoffee an equivalent elsewhere."], [757, "291 WALFORD. Again, at the Assizes of October 1272, Isolda, daughter of Peter (read Richard) de Fennemare, sued Mable de Fennemere and John her son for another third of the Manor of Fennemare. She now deduced her claim from one Edwyn, living in the time of King John, to Edwin, his son and heir ; \u2014 from the last Edwin to Richard, his son and heir ; from Richard to John, his son and heir ; \u2014 from John, who died issueless, to Thomas, his brother and heir ; \u2014 and from Thomas, who died issueless, to Isolda, his sister and heir, the present Plaintiff. The Defendants replied that Thomas had two sisters, viz. Isolda (the present Plaintiff) and Matilda, the elder of the two, of whom there was no mention in the Plaintiff's case. Isolda deuied this, and affirmed that Peter (read Thomas) had no other sister but herself. The Jury found that Thomas (sic, recte) had two sisters ; so Isolda was in misericordid. I have noticed under Acton Reynald that at these same Assizes there was a suit between Stephen de Aysford and Reyner de Acton about a tenement in Fennemere.1 This leads up to the fur ther information of the Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279, viz. that \" Reginald de Acton then held Fenymer immediately under Richard fitz Alan.\" \u00bbalfortr< The Domesday Hundred of Bascherch contained a Fief, not as yet alluded to, aud which was held by Robert Pincerna under the Norman Earl. Walford is the first Manor in the series, and is thus described in the Record. \u2014 Rot ber lus Pincerna tenet, de Rogerio Comite Waleford, et Sturmid de eo. Seuuard tenuit tempore Regis Edwardi.

Modo valet xx solidos.2 Robert Pincerna was probably Chief Butler to the Norman Earls of Shrewsbury. He was living in the time of Earl Hugh (1093-8), and attests with the Earl a Charter already noticed.3 He probably shared the forfeiture of his Suzerain, Earl Robert, in 1102; for 1 Supra, page 63. \"\u25a0 Domesday, fo. 256, a, 2. 3 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 170."], [758, "292 WALFORD. Henry I., when he founded the Honour of Montgomery, seems to have annexed thereto the whole escheated estate of Robert Pin cerna. This being the general rule, we expect to find that any Manor, primarily held under Robert Pincerna, was subsequently held under the Lords of Montgomery. What became of Robert Pincerna's Tenant, Sturmid, I know not. In 1201, William fitz Gilbert was a principal Tenant of the then Lord of Montgomery. He held 3 hides of land, situated in Walford, Stanwardine-in-the-Field, Eyton (near Baschurch), Aston (near Oswestry) , the two Hislands (near Oswestry) , the two Woottons (near Oswestry), and in Twiford. By a Fine, levied at Shrewsbury, before Henry (de Furneaux), Sheriff, William fitz Alan, and other Lieges of the King, on October 15, 1201, William fitz Gilbert sur rendered the above 3 hides to Reginald de Hedinge; \u2014 who had sued him under a King's- Writ for the same. Iu return, Reginald de Hedinge gave William fitz Gilbert half a hide in Stanford, and undertook to provide him for life with food, apparel, and horses, as if he were his nephew (sicut unum ex nepotibus suis) . William fitz Gilbert was heir, it seems, of his elder brother, Walter. He died within two years after the above Fine, without issue, and left an only sister, Alice. At the Assizes of 1203, this Alice, claiming to be heir of her brother Walter, sued Reginald de Hedding for an eighth part of a knight's-fee in Stanworthin, Eiton, Walleford, Twiford, Aston, Wodeton, Parva Wodeton, Hideslond, and Parva Hideslond. Reginald appeared, acknowledged that Walter had died seized of the premises, but added that, since then, William, Wal ter's brother, had also died. This objection, fatal to any suit of mort d'ancestre, was not controverted by Alice. The Court gave her leave, if she chose, to sue under another form, viz. by a Writ de recto} She thought it better to compromise the matter. A Fine was forthwith (that is, on Oct. 6, 1203) levied, whereby Alice fitz Gilbert (Plaintiff) quitclaimed the whole premises to Reginald de Hedinge (Tenant) who conceded to her, for life, one virgate and 3\\ bovates of the same fee, in Stanworthin, to hold, by payment of 20d. rent to Reginald, and by discharge of all services due to the Crown. Reginald also gave Alice 30s. in money. In Michaelmas Term, 1213, I find Reginald de Hesting naming Philip fitz Simon his Attorney in a Placitum intrusionis against Walter Flandrensis. Soon afterwards, \"Reginald de Hastings fines half a merk that he may compound his suit with Walter Flandren- 1 Assizes, 5 John, m. 5."], [759, "293 WALFORD. sis concerning one virgate and 3\u00a3 bovates in Stanwurthin. And Walter appeared, and surrendered the land as the right of Re ginald, according to a Fine levied between the said Reginald and Alice fitz Gilbert.\" I suppose that Alice fitz Gilbert was now dead, and that Walter le Fleming, either as Seigneural Lord, or as heir or assignee, had entered on the land which, under the Fine of 1203, she only held for life, with remainder to Reginald de Hesding. Reginald de Hesding, thus enriched, was probably a relation of the Fitz Alans. In 1190 and 1196 he had served as Deputy- Sheriff under the second William fitz Alan. In May 4212, when Fitz Alan's Barony was in the King' s-hand, Reginald de Hesding was acting as Constable of Oswestry in the service of King John. Reginald de Hesding had a son, Ernulf, who had married Cecily, daughter and coheir of John de Marchomley, before 1206, and had acquired with her a property in Essex.1 About 1216-1218, \"Reginald de Hedinge gave to Haghmon Abbey three half- virgates in Walford, with all his share of the wood of Walford, also all his land of Twiford, viz. 3 nokes, and all his land in Great and Little Wootton, viz. 4 nokes, and all his land of Aston, with its meadows, moors, &c, and all his land of Great and Little Hisland, both that which he had in demesne and that which was held under him in villeinage; \u2014 saving only the services due to the Chief- Lords. Witnesses, \u2014 John fitz Alan, Robert de Girros, Vivian de Roshall.\" After this I hear nothing more of the Hes dings as connected with Shropshire. It is clear that the interest which they had acquired from the Fitz Gilberts, in Walford and elsewhere, was the interest of a Tenant or of a Coparcener, and not in any case an entire Manor. The above account, I may here say, seems to involve but a fraction of a very ramified subject. I think that the person called \u2014 Walter le Fleming, or Walter Flandrensis, whom I have next to notice, must have lived in the reigns of Richard I., John, and the early part of Henry III. He certainly held Walford, Stanwar dine-in-the-fields, and Eyton, immediately under the Lords of Montgomery. There is evidence that his Tenure was even more extensive than this. It was however these three Manors which con stituted what was usually called the Fee of Stanwardine. This Walter left six or more daughters to share his inheritance. Two of his daughters were yet unmarried in 1227. One of his daughters ' Supra, Vol. IX. p. 274."], [760, "294 WALFORD. (Juliana) and at least three of her sisters were alive in 1248-9 ; but five of Walter le Fleming's daughters were represented by their Grandchildren, or by still more remote descendants, in the year 1292, and that fact alone is sufficient to fix the \u00e6ra of Walter le Fleming as early as I have placed it. It is hardly possible that one of his daughters can have been wife of that Gilbert, and mother of that Walter, and William, and Alice, who have been mentioned above. I therefore conclude the latter to have been his Tenants. The Feodary of 1240 is too concise to be instructive as to the Fee of Stanwardine. It merely says that \" Juliana de Stanewor thin and he* Coparceners hold a knight's-fee in Staneworthin of the Fees of William de Cantilupe\"1 (then Lord of Montgomery). Here Juliana not only represents herself, but at least five Sisters or their descendants, and Stanwardine represents at least three Manors, of which Walford was one. Among the Coparceners he who perhaps had the chief interest in Walford was \u2014 Philip de Hugford. His wife's name was Sibil ; and Cecilia, daughter and coheir of Walter le Fleming, is said to have had a daughter. Sibil ; but the husband of Cecilia le Fleming I cannot name. One Philip de Hugford comes into notice as early as 1209. His predicament at that date has already been told.2 He was prob ably a brother of that Walter de Hugford who was living at the time, and involved in a similar trouble. In 1240 Philip de Hug ford and his wife Sibil had a Tenant at Walford, viz. Richard le. Knicht, who held a virgate of land under them by the singular ser vice which probably obtained for him the sobriquet of Le Knight. His duty was, when ordered, to ride in the company of his Suze rains, at any time of the year, and to any part of Shropshire, at his own charges ; but, if he went out of the county, his expenses were to be paid. There was a dispute about this service; and, by a Fine levied on November 18, 1240, it was commuted for an annual rent of 2s., payable to Philip and Sibil and the heirs of Sibil. Philip and Sibil also granted to their tenant estovers in Walford Wood, to be taken under view of their Foresters, and barring all future hin drance from Sibil's heirs. Sibil, wife of Philip de Hugford, occurs in 1249, and Philip de Hugford was living in 1255. His position as one of the Coparceners, then stated to be holding Stanwardine, must be taken to extend to the whole Fee of Stanwardine. All that I can further say of Philip de Hugford has respect to his wife, Sibil, if she was indeed a daughter of Cecilia, daughter of Walter 1 Testa de NeviU, p. 46. \u00bb Supra, Vol. III. p. 14."], [761, "295 WALFORD. le Fleming. Sibil, a daughter of the said Cecilia, is said, in one Record, to have left a daughter, Sibil, and the latter Sibil to have left a daughter and heir, Amicia, and Amicia to have had a daugh ter Evota, which Evota was living in 1292, but not taking any share in a Suit to which some of the Coparceners in the Fee of Stanwardine were parties. This statement involves improbabilities both chronological and genealogical, but I cannot correct it any further than by questioning its truth as a whole. Another estate at Walford seems to be the burthen of the fol lowing documents, but whether any of the parties were coheirs of Walter le Fleming, or only tenants or assignees of those Coheirs, I cannot determine. On September 26, 1260, Nicholas de Walford is suing Robert de Bullers and others for disseizing him of a tene ment in Walesford. On May 28, 1283, a Fine was levied which shows that William fitz Baldwin1 and his wife Sibil were seized of half the Manor of Walford. Eva, wife of Walter le Drayton, to whom they propose to give the said moiety, was one of three or more Sisters, daughters, I believe, of Hugh de Wotherton, who was alive at the time. If this surmise be correct, Eva was now 17 years of age. By the above Fine William fitz Baldwin and Sibil settle the said moiety of Walford, on Walter and Eva and the heirs of Eva ; \u2014 paying a rent of 2 cloves to the Grantors, and to the heirs of Sibil, and performing all capital services. If Eva should die without issue by her husband Walter, and her sisters Amicia and Johanna should be living at the time ; then the Eastern half (versus Solem) of the said moiety was to go to Amicia and the heirs of her body, paying a rent of one clove to the Grantors, &c. ; and the Western half (that versus umbram) was to remain similarly to Jo hanna. If either Amicia or Joanna died issueless in the lifetime of the other, there was a remainder of their respective shares to the Survivor. For the whole settlement, Walter de Drayton and his wife, Eva, are stated to give a sore hawk. It is a conjecture, but, I think, a reasonable one, that the above Walter de Drayton died without issue by his wife, Eva, and that it was she who (being, as I know, a widow in October 1292) after wards remarried with Richard Hord. I can account in no other his wife Sibil had. She may have been Philip de Hugford' s daughter. The Grantees in the above Fine were not re lated to William and Sibil in any way likely to induce such a settlement. I suppose it was in the nature of a bargain. 1 William fits Baldwin's real name was, I think, De Boilers ; so that perhaps he was related to Robert de Bullers, above mentioned. I cannot think that William had himself any right of coparcenery in Walford, though it seems probable that"], [762, "296 WALFORD. way for the prominent interest which the Hords acquired in Wal ford. They were a numerous family, these Hords, but the branch of which I speak is usually distinguished as of Walford. \u2014 Hord of Walford. Richard Hord married Eva, the eldest of four sisters and Coheirs of John de Wodenorton (now Wotherton). By this match he obtained lands at Wotherton and Rodenhurst. Eva was aged 30 at the time of her brother's death (March 1296) } Indeed Richard Hord of Walford will have married his wife, Eva, soon after October 1292 (if she was Walter de Drayton's widow), for on September 8, 1293, their eldest son, Richard, was born. In December 1296 Richard Hord appears as Juror on a Forest Inquest. \" On January 1, 1307, the Abbot of Haghmon demises, in perpetual farm, to Richard Hord and Eva his wife, and their heirs lawfully begotten, all the Abbot's part of the vill of Walleford, both mes suages and lands, saving to the Abbot his Wood of Walford and a parcel of waste. The Feoffees are to pay a rent of 2 merks, for which they bind all the land which they have in Walford. A Heriot also, and a Relief on succession of any heir, are reserved.

The Abbot had fenced a place called Symon desley, in Walford, and the Knight, claiming a right of common there, had pulled the fence down. The agreement allows the Abbot's improvements to a certain extent, and reserves some advantages of common for the knight's tenants at Eton and Jagdon. Sir Thomas is also allowed to make a fence between Muridon Wood and Jagdon Park.1 An agreement made May 27, 1340, between Adam, Abbot of Shrewsbury, and the Abbot of Haghmon again shows Richard Hord as a Landowner in Walford. The Abbot of Haghmon had assarted some land, between his own Wood and the new assart of Richard Hord, and had, under his privileges, tilled it tithe-free. Recently it had been leased for life to Richard de Walford; and the Abbot of Shrewsbury, as Impropriator of Baschurch Rectory, successfully maintained that it was now tithable, and would remain so as long as it was leased to any tenant, secular or religious. But he allowed that on its resumption by Haghmon it would again be come tithe-free.2 Richard Hord (II) was living in 1346. John Hord, of Walford, son and perhaps successor of Richard, was, with his wife Margery, outlawed for felony in June 1350. By an Inquest, held on Dec. 8, 1354, they appear to have held a mes suage and virgate in Walford, and 14s. annual rent, in Eyton, under William la Zouche of Haryngworth. Roger le Fox was now (1354) holding the premises, but the King had never had the usual (year and day) tenure of the same, nor had any one else, on the King's behalf.3 Outlawry at the period of which we treat was by no means deci- sive of the fate of a family. \u2014 Roger Hord of Stanwardine was Lord of Roden in 1372 and Sheriff of Shropshire in 1381. * He was clearly the representative of the Hords of Walford, and, supposing Blakeway's account to be correct, he was ancestor of the Hords of Hords-Park (near Bridg north) . If so, it must have been through a younger son, for the elder male line of Hord of Walford ended with\u2014 John, son of Roger Hord, who died in Ireland on July 20, 1398. He had long before his death, enfeoffed various Trustees in his Manors of Walford and Wotherton, in the reversionary Manor of Stanwardine-in-the-Wood and in his lands at Chelmick and Ro denhurst.

Walter le Fleming had (as I have said) six or more daughters and coheirs. Of some of them I shall speak presently. To show how directly the Fee of Stanwardine was held under the Lords of Montgomery, and how the term \" Fee of Stanwardine \" was used to designate more Manors than one, I will here quote an entry from the Assize- Roll of August 1226. \u2014 \" The Abbot of Hageman had been summoned to answer William de Cantilupe (then Lord of Montgomery) as to the Abbot's intrusion into (that part of) William's Fee of Staneworthyn, which was now held by Robert de Teneraye. The Parties had agreed out of Court, and were amerced for so doing ; but the Record states that the Abbot had acknowledged that any wardships and reliefs which might accrue within the Fee were due to Cantilupe, and that he undertook to'render such dues.\" Now, in Stanwardine itself, the Abbot had not an acre. Therefore the Fee of Stanwardine refers to his acquisitions in Walford, Aston, Twiford, Wooton, and Hisland. Robert de Teneraye's tenure under Cantilupe is quite another matter. Knowing what we do of Robert de Teneraye, it is clear that no such right can have accrued with his wife, who was an heiress at Haughton (near Morville), and probably married him while he was constable of Bridgnorth. His tenure in the fee of Stanwardine may have been as successor to De Hesding, or as a Bailiff of the Lords of Montgomery, or else as having custody of some of Walter le Fleming's Coheirs. And now for these said Coheirs. \u2014 The Feodary of 1240 only in forms us that \" Juliana de Staneworthin and her Coparceners hold a knight's-fee in Stanemorthin under William de Cantilupe.\"1 \u2014 Juliana de Stanwardine was undoubtedly one of the daugh ters of Walter le Fleming. A. Fine of November 8, 1248, names, I suppose, three more daughters and two other descendants of Walter le Fleming. These were Amilia, wife of Yarwurth fitz Ma doc, Illaria fitz Walter, Elizabeth fitz Walter, Hugh fitz Hugh, and Hamo'le Butiler.

They were \" Juliana, daughter of Walter le Fleming \" (with whom the list commences) ; \" Sibil, wife of Philip de Hugford ; Hugh de Patinton ; Alora le Fleming (perhaps the Maria fitz Walter of the Fine) ; Amilia, wife of Yarford fitz Madok; Elizabeth, Amilia's sister ; Hugh fitz Hugh ; and Hamo le Botyler.\" Here I take it that Juliana, Alora, Amilia, and Elizabeth were daughters, and that Sibil was granddaughter of Walter le Fleming. How Hugh de Patinton, Hugh fitz Hugh, and Hamo le Botyler represented any daughters of Walter le Fleming I will try to de termine elsewhere. The Pimhill Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" William de Lech ton, Philip de Huggeford, the Abbot of Haemon, Hugh de Patin ton, and John de Esseford, hold 5| geldable hides in Stanewrthin ; and the estate is of the Fee of William de Cantilupe, and held by doing service of one knight yearly in wartime. It does suit to County and Hundred, and paid 3s. 8d. for motfee and stretward.\" This estimate must have included at least three Domesday Manors, viz. Stanwardine (2 hides), Walford (2 hides), and Eyton (1 hide). It also included something more, but where that something (re presented by another half-hide) was, I will not here discuss. As to the five sharers in the Fee of Stanwardine, named in the Hundred Roll, the Abbot of Haughmond did not represent any Coparcener. His feoffment had been abstracted from the estate before it fell to the daughters of Walter le Fleming. The Hundred-Roll gives us the names then of two ascertained Coparceners (Philip de Huggeford and Hugh de Patinton) and also of two persons (William de Lechton and John de Esseford), who have not appeared before in this suc cession. How they acquired their shares I cannot certainly deter mine, but I think William de Leighton's was by purchase rather than by inheritance. About Lady Day 1259, Alina, widow of William de Stanwardine (Stanwardine-in-the-Wood), had some such interest in Eyton (a member of Stanwardine in the Field) as enabled her to demise half a virgate and 12c?. rent there, to the above Sir William de Leighton for a term of 9 years. Sir William de Leighton died in 1262, when only 3 years of his term had expired. John le Strange (pro bably in some right of Seigneury) entered upon the premises and reinvested Alina therewith, to the manifest injury of Richard, son and heir of Sir William. Richard however recovered the remainder ofthe term against Alina at the Assizes of 1272 ; but which, if any, Coparcener of Stanwardine was represented by Alina, I cannot say."], [767, "301 STANWARDINE IN THE FIELD. By a Fine of Feb. 3, 1268, Isolda de Stanworthin (who was un doubtedly a holder of some one of the original shares of this Fief) surrenders, as by gift, to Robert de Wynesbury, as Attorney of Sibil de Stanworthin, 6 virgates in Stanworthin, Aston, Stanlowe, and Wynnesbury. Iu return, Sibil concedes the premises to Isolda for life, to hold by a penny rent ; with reversion to Sibil and her heirs, \u2014 to hold of the superior Lords of the Fee.\" Possibly Isolda was Sibil's mother. Perhaps also she was a daughter of Cecilia le Fleming (deceased before 1248) and widow of John de Esseford (living in 1267). Sibil, it is nearly certain, was hereditarily a Co heiress of Stanwardine, and afterwards became the wife of Walter, son of Henry de Wotherton. At the Assizes of 1272 Richard de Leighton not only recovered the remainder of his term of a lease at Eyton, as above stated, but recovered against Robert de Wynesbury the fee-simple of a quarter virgate in Stanwardine Alchamp, of which he proved his father William to have died seized. The Inquest taken in 1273 on the death of George de Cantilupe seems to have recognized his Seigneury (as Lord of Montgomery) over Stanwardine.1 We next have a recurrent mention of one of the Coparceners of 1249. Under Felton Butler I have shown that on Jan. 20, 1278, Hamo de Botyler settled certain lands at Felton and Ness on his younger son, William. On the same day he settled on another younger son, John, one messuage, 2\\ virgates, and 20 acres in Stanewordyn-o'-the-Field, Aston-juxta-Twyford, and Wynesbury. John restored the premises to his Father, to hold for life at a rose rent. On his death the premises were to revert to John and his heirs,\u2014 to hold of the heirs of Hamo, at a rose-rent, and by per forming capital services.2 On July 1, 1283, Hamo le Botyler settled on his son, William, premises as great or greater than those settled by the two previous Fines on his sons, Wilbam and John, and situated in Felton Butler, Stanwordyn-of-te-Feld, Aston-juxta-Twyford, and Wynesbury. Here William was to have immediate seizin of all, and pay his Father a life-annuity of 40s., but only a rose-rent to his Father's heirs. I have given the Fine at length under Felton Butler.3 It was levied, actual, quite mistaken. These Lords of Holgate had no Seigneury in the premises now settled, though they had in Felton Butler. 1 Calend. Inquis. Vol. I. p. 49. \u2022\u25a0 Pedes Finium, Edw. I., Salop, No. 27.

I conceive, because Hamo le Botyler's eldest son was now deceased without issue, and because John, being the eldest surviving son, no longer needed a younger brother's portion. Certainly (as we shall see) John le Botyler was living in 1292, and then represented his Grand mother, one of the daughters of Walter le Fleming, and one of the original Coparceners in Stanwardine. The Pimhill Tenure-Roll of 1279 has the following entry. \u2014 \" Stanwardyne-super-Campum te nentur cum membris de Willielmo de la Suche per servicium unius militis per 15 dies ad Montemgomere tempore guerr\u00e6.\" The mention of William la Zouch at this period is very singular. He was son and heir of his Father, Eudo la Zouche, who was only re cently deceased ; he was also heir- apparent of his Mother, Milicent de Cantilupe, elder sister and coheir of George de Cantilupe, and now a widow for a second time. Her first husband, John de Mont alt, was deceased without issue before 1274; her second husband, Eudo la Zouche, was living in 1277, but was now deceased. Her son, William la Zouche, was probably an infant in 1279. When, in 1280-4, Milisent de Montalt (as she chose most often to be styled) was suing several Tenants of the Honour of Montgo mery for the services due to herself as Suzerain, it is evident that she sued some at least of the Tenants of Stanwardyne. The entries on the Plea- Rolls are very confused ; but the names of Hugh de Patinton and Roger de Stanwarthyn are perhaps appropriately used in connection with the subject.1 Roger de Stanwardine was son and heir of William and Alina de Stanwardine, already mentioned. At the Assizes of 1292 the Pimhill Jurors presented that the Lords of Stanewrthin-in-campo had been wont to do monthly suits to the County, and suit every three weeks to the Hundred, till 40 years since. The present Tenants were John le Botyller, Richard de Leyghton, Walter, son of Hugh de Wodreton, Walter, son of Henry de Woderton, William, son of John de Carricova, Richard Porcel, Eva, relict of Walter de Drayton, and Hugh de Patyton. These all appeared, and stated that they did suit to the Hundred, but allowed that the suit to the County had been withdrawn the alleged period, viz. from the time of Walter le Flemyng, who held Stanewardyne-in-campo wholly. This would have been more pro bahly for 70 rather than 40 years : and the Lords of Stanwardyne seem to have complacently compounded for their arrears by a Fine of 5 merks. Again, the Jurors presented how William de Stanwardine-in- 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 122. William de i duced, in the entry of Easter Term, 1280, Stanwardyne's name is probably intro- j by mistake for Roger."], [771, "STANWARDINE IN THE FIELD. 305 bosco had 30 years back (he had been dead at least 33 years) with drawn from the Hundred a suit due every three weeks for 3 nokes which he held in Eyton. The King recovered 12*. arrears on this account from William le Chapman, the existing tenant. A cause, which was tried at the same Assizes of 1292, distin guishes those persons who had interests in Stanwardine, as heirs of Walter le Fleming, from those who had obtained ingress by other means. The latter were Richard, son of William de Leighton, and Robert fitz Henry. They each held a messuage and a noke in Stanwardin in la Feld, and were impleaded by the Coparceners, or alleged Coparceners, in a body. The Plaintiffs said that the Defendants only obtained possession by the acts of William de Leighton and Henry de Stanworthyng, who had further obtained such ingress by a disseizin of five daughters of Walter le Fleming, of which five daughters the Plaintiffs were Grandchildren and heirs. The five daughters named, are Cecilia, Hillaria, Amicia, a second Hillaria, and Isolda. Their Grandchildren, the present Plaintiffs, are named, I think, in an irrespective order. They were John, son of Hamo le Botyller ; Sibil, wife of Walter, son of Henry de Wode warton; Walter fitz Hugh ; Richard, son of Richard Purcel ; and William de Carrecova. \u2014 The Defendants got judgment on the ground that all the Co parceners were not joining in the prosecution. The specific alle gation was that Cecilia, one of Walter le Fleming's daughters, was not entirely represented by that Grandchild (whichever it was) who was one of the Plaintiffs ; for that the said Cecilia had left three daughters, Juliana, Sibil, and Matilda ; \u2014 that the said Juliana had a son John, who had a son Hugh, who had a son Hugh ,- \u2014 that the said Sibil had a daughter Sibil, who had a daughter Amicia, who had a daughter Evota; \u2014 that the said Matilda had a son, Hugh, who had a son Hugh ; \u2014 lastly, that Hugh, Evota, and Hugh, the representatives of these branches, were all now living, but were not named in the Plaintiffs' Writ.1 In constructing the above Genealogical Table of the descendants of Walter le Fleming, I have been careful to insert, on my own judgment, nothing which is con tradictory to the many Records which have been, or will be cited on the subject. The only exercise of ingenuity has been in making a Pedigree which will tally with all and each of the said Records. To the bare details of those Records, which treat purely of this Coheirship, I have further added what I know independently of the families of Butler, Wotherton, Purcel, and Patinton, making it however subsidiary to Assizes, 20 Edw.

This tradition certainly acquires un usual weight when we find that Leuui was Saxon owner both of Leighton and Eyton, and that in those distant Manors the Leigh tons were subsequently interested. The Leightons, however, pos sessed the whole of Leighton and only a part of Eyton. Moreover, Robert, the Domesday Tenant of Eyton, was not Domesday Tenant of Leighton. However, if this Robert were a Saxon, and son of Leuui, he may have recovered Leighton after Domesday, and he may have been a second ancestor of the Leightons. After Domesday, Eyton has seldom any notice as a distinct Manor, but is usually treated as a member of the \" Fee of Stanwar dine.\" Under that Manor several allusions have already been made to Eyton. A few local and personal particulars have now to be added. \u2014 In 1221 a dispute about the tithes of Eton juxta Bascherch was settled in favour of Shrewsbury Abbey. \" Philip de Novo Burgo, Dean \" (Rural-Dean, I presume) announces the said settlement as having been made \" in full Chapter in the Church of St. Chad.\"3 In 1233 we have mention of a John de Eyton as the only one of 1 Domesday, fo. 256, a, 2. tions.

In 1274 we have Richard le Champyun of Eyton on a local Jury. In March 1276, one Roger de Eyton (perhaps of some other place) sat on the Inquest-post-mortem of John le Strange (IV). In 1292 we have had mention of William le Chapman as Tenant of a part of Eyton, and as responsible for its suit to Pimhill Hun dred.5 He was probably a Sub-tenant of the Stanwardines or the Leightons. About 1323-5 he attests a Deed (already quoted) as William Chapman of Eyton.6 Meantime, that is about Michaelmas 1298, we have a Deed, whereby Richard de Leighton, Knight, grants to Sir Richard, Per petual Vicar of Baschurch, a twelve-years' lease of 2 messuages and one virgate in Eyton juxta Baschurch, also of the Lessor's share in the Weir of Wallebroke, and liberty for the Vicar and his heirs to fish in the Mere of Fennimare during the said term.

Its Fisheries, probably in the River Perry, may give a hint as to its situation. Its great position in Saxon times, as a Manor of the Earls of Mercia, and its extraor dinary value, do but perplex us as to its suppression. Here I must make a larger conjecture than I am at any time willing to offer; but confessed doubt is perhaps better than utter silence. My idea is that the 14 hides of Crugetone contributed half a hide towards those 5| hides which in 1255 formed the Fee of Stanwardine-in campo; which Fee was just half a hide in excess of what we should expect from a comparison of Domesday and the Hundred-Rolls. The remaining hide of Crugeton I take to have been suppressed in calculations later than Domesday. In other words, the Domesday estimate of Walford (2 hides), Stanwardine (2 hides), Hetone (1 hide), and Crugetone (1\\ hides), is more than the estimate of 1255, viz. Stanwardine (5| hides), by one hide. Possibly then, while speaking of Stanwardine-in-the-field and Eyton, we have been speaking substantively of the absorbed Manor of Crugetone. jetton. This Manor of Robert Pincerna is described in Domesday as follows.\u2014 Isdem Robertus tenet Pectone et Radulfus de eo. Leuenot tenuit. Ibi 1 hida et dimidia.

Modo (valet) x solidos.1 Under Oldbury and Eaton Constantine, I have stated the proba bilities that Radulf, Domesday Lord of Petton and Oldbury, was ancestor of the Constantines ; and I have shown how, in the gene ration after Domesday, Hugh de Constantine (probably Radulf's son) gave half a hide in Petton to Shrewsbury Abbey.2 Thence forth the mesne tenure of the Constantines vanishes from Petton, and the Manor is held under the Lords of Montgomery by persons (perhaps Cadets of the Constantines) who adopted a name from the place. When, in the following remarks, Petton is included in the Fee of Stanwardine, or otherwise confused with Stanwardine, nothing more is meant than that both Manors were held under the Lords of Montgomery. King Henry II.'s Confirmation of 1155 speaks of a virgate in Stock having been given by Richard de Pecton to Shrewsbury Abbey. I have yet to learn where Stoch was, but, in Richard de Pecton we have, I doubt not, the ancestor of the Pettons. Passing over nearly a century we find one whom I will call \u2014 Richard de Pecton (II) attesting a grant which related to Stockett near Ellesmere.3 The following perhaps relates to Peaton, near Corfham. \u2014 On May 3, 1237, Alexander de Cheney, Tenant of half a virgate in -Pecton, surrenders the same to Richard de Pecton and his wife Isolda, as the right of Isolda, who had claimed it under Writ of mort d'ancestre. For this quitclaim Richard and Isolda gave 2| merks. In 1248 and 1253 Richard de Pecton occurs on a Withyford and on a Haughmond Jury, and from thence till 1255 is a frequent witness of local Deeds. At the Eyre of Roger de Turkilby (November 1248), 65. 8d. was charged against Thomas le Cresp and Robert de Pecton, proplevind. The debt was still partly in arrear in 1252, when also Alexander de Chaeney owes 20.$. for being let out of prison on bail (ut tradalur per ballivum). These persons, if connected with Petton, were only Undertenants. At the Inquest of 1255 Richard de Petton is named third of the Pimhill Jurors. \"He held 1\\ hides in Petton, which was of the Fee of Stanwardine.\" \" His service was to attend the Lord of Stanwardine (meaning George de Cantilupe, an Infant) in wartime, i Domesday, h. 2t>6, a, 2. 2 Supra, Vol. I. p. 133 ; Vol. VIII. p. 1. * Supra, p. 250."], [776, "310 PETTON. with a bow and two unfeathered arrows for 15 days, at the cost of the said Lord. He held half a hide also in Petton of the fee of the Abbot of Salop, at a rent of 2*. yearly. Petton did suit, in common with the Manor of Stanwardine, to County and Hundred. It also paid 8d. for motfee and stretward.\"1 Here we see that the Abbot of Shrewsbury had given the later Lords of Petton a re-feoffment of what Hugh de Constantine had bestowed on the Abbey. It is not clear whether the Record intends this half-hide to be included in the 1\\ hides of Petton, or not. Domesday would suggest the former. So also the payment for stretward, being proportionate to one hide, would indicate that only one hide in the Manor was a lay fee. It is probable that, soon after this, Richard de Petton (II) died ; for I take it to have been \u2014 Richard de Petton (III) who, in January 1256, recovered 2\\ acres in Pecton (from Henry fitz John), proving himself to be son and heir of Richard de Pecton, who had died seized thereof. Later in the same year we have seen Richard or Roger de Petton, or both, at issue with Sir John le Strange,2 who was probably taking great liberties with Cantilupe's Fee during the infancy of the heir. There was a Roger de Petton living at this time ; and, though he was first Juror for Pimhill Hundred at the Assizes of 1256, I suspect that he was only an Undertenant of Richard's. His father's name will appear to have been John. He left an only daughter and heir, Sibil, an infant at his death. After the Assizes of 1256, and previous to those of 1272, Richard de Petton acted as one of the Coroners of Shropshire. His death, while in office, is recorded on the Roll of 1272. On the latter Roll is also notice of a suit of dower which Matilda, widow of Reginald de Fraunceys, had, in the first instance, arraigned against Richard de Petton, Richard fitz Chapelen and Margery his wife, and Griffin Seule and Agnes his wife, but had since withdrawn. It was her late husband's tenement at \" Petton,\" in which she had sought dower. Richard de Petton (III) was living in April 1263, but had been succeeded before the end of the same year by his son or brother viz. Peter de Petton. In Trinity Term 1263, and in Michaelmas Term 1266, we have notices of an order which had been made on the Sheriff to distrain on the lands of Peter de Petton for a sum of 40s., which was to be forwarded to Westminster, and handed over to Thomas Corbet (of Caus) in satisfaction of a trespass committed 1 Rot. Hundred. II. 75. 2 Supra, p. 288."], [777, "311 PETTON. by the said Peter. In the first instance, the Sheriff declared that Peter had no lands in his Bailiwick, but the Justiciars had been in formed of lands and chattels which he had at Pecton. So (though a civil war had been waged and concluded in the interval) the Jus tices renewed their order in 1266. Again, in Michaelmas Term 1266, and Hilary Term 1267, we have Peter, son of Richard de Petton, suing Roger de Stanwardine for a messuage and two vir gates in Stanwardine which Peter claimed as his right. The issue of this suit has appeared under Stanwardine-in-the-Wood.1 The Pipe-Roll of 1267 informs us of a composition of half a merk nego tiated by Peter de Pecton for himself and his Sureties, he having withdrawn from some Lawsuit. At the Assizes of 1272 Peter de Petton appears as a Juror in the famous suit related under Albright-lee. He himself failed to pro secute his suit against Geoffrey de Ford, viz. \" requiring the said Geoffrey to restore Sibil, daughter and heir of Roger, son of John de Petton, which Roger had held half a virgate by knight's-service under Peter, viz. by one-fortieth part of a knight's-fee.\" Again, at these Assizes, Roger fitz Hugh and Alan de Hochton were found to have disseized Peter de Petton of half an acre in Petton. Cecily, wife of Peter de Petton, seems to have brought him some property in Ness. On November 18, 1272, Peter and Cecilia allow by Fine that they have granted a messuage and half-virgate in Nesse to John le Keu, who gives xi merks and is to hold the pre mises by a glove-rent or Id., under the Grantors and the heirs of Cecilia, and to perform all capital services. On the Hundred Inquest of 1274, and on other Inquests of 1274 and 1276, Peter de Petton occurs as a Juror. The Tenure-Roll of 1279 has a very confused statement about this Manor. I copy it, adding some corrective remarks. \u2014 \" Stanwardyne (read Petton) .

He was certainly Lord of Petton in 1301, when a mes suage and 3 acres in Petton were held under him by Matilda, widow of Robert Corbet of Morton, who had obtained the same from Juli ana, widow of Philip le Crump of Petton.1 THE CHAPEL. This was an early Foundation, but from the first a Chapel of Baschurch, as the Chartulary of Shrewsbury Abbey (already quoted on the subject2) proves most clearly. The Lords of the Fee usually founded and endowed these Chapels ; but when they were in the district of an impropriated Rectory, the Rectors, especially if they were Monks, watched their opportunity, and, when the revenues or pa tronage of a Chapel became worth seizing, greedily absorbed them. Thus Petton Chapel was founded in or before the time of Bishop Durdent, who died in 1159 ; \u2014 was of the Advowson ofthe Lord of Petton in 1306, but in 1344 was in the patronage of the Monks of Shrewsbury. It is remarkable that though the Taxation of 1291 says nothing about Petton Chapel, as distinct from Baschurch, yet that in 1341 the Commissioners assessed the Parish to the Ninth. Their assess ment was only 10s., because there had been a general murrain of sheep, and because the Chapel of Pecton was chiefly supported by oblations, and because the hay-tithes and all such income went to form the reputed Taxation of the Chapel (but was no Index for the present assessment).8 The Valor of 1534-5 gives Robert * * * * as Rector of Petton, and his income as \u00a33. 6s. 8d. per annum, less lid. for Synodals and Is. 8d. for Procurations.4 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

The Manor of Estone (being Astone, near Oswestry) has been as signed to Mersete rather than to Baschurch Hundred, though Domesday places it in the latter.1 It will be seen that, with two exceptions, every known Manor of Mersete Hundred is contained in the modern Hundred of Oswestry. The said exceptions are Chenlei and Derniou, two districts which had been conquered from, or surrendered by, the Welsh ; and which the Domesday Scribe annexed to Mersete Hundred for mere con venience of classification. One of these districts was afterwards reputed to be in Montgomeryshire, the other in Merionethshire. On the other hand, the present Hundred of Oswestry contains one Manor (Ruyton), which at the time of Domesday belonged to Bascherch, not to Mersete, Hundred. It is probable too that Oswestry Hundred is, in some other respects, more comprehensive than was the Hundred of Mersete. I mean that certain Welsh territory, as yet unconquered when Domesday was compiled, was afterwards appropriated by the Normans, and annexed to Oswestry Hundred. Viewing the successive Hundreds of Mersete and Oswestry as one in all the more essential particulars, the history of its juris diction is soon told. King Edward the Confessor was Lord of the Hundred in his day, and Maesbury was then its caput. Earl Roger de Montgomery gave both Maesbury Manor and Mersete Hundred to his Sheriff, Warin. Rainald, Warin's successor, held both at Domesday, but it was probably during his \u00e6ra that Oswestry be came the caput of the Hundred.

Oswestry Hundred, as might be expected from such antecedents, was exempt from English Law. It sent no deputies to meet the King's Judges at the County Assizes. Its frontier was a barrier to the King's Sheriff and his subordinates. The Chief, for the time being, of the House of Fitz Alan, was supreme in all local concerns. The King's Writ, except as addressed to him, was a dead letter. He rendered no acknowledgment, except homage and fealty, for the exercise of his jurisdiction. His responsibility, if such it can be called, to guard the Welsh Border, was limited to a due and efficient maintenance of Oswestry Castle. Where such a jurisdiction existed, and where local Records are lost, the facts which are available for history are necessarily scanty. The Manors of Mersete Hundred will therefore occupy a space on our pages of far less compass than the extent and importance of the district would seem to deserve. One Borough, one great Church, a Preceptory of Hospitallers, and a number of Castles, will form the chief objects of topographical inquiry; and in proportion to such a division of subjects we shall have to speak rather of war and rapine, than of eleemosynary grants, to say more of treaties and diplomacy, than of the developement of municipal institutions or the workings of national law. jHaesrtmrp an* #stoestrp. That part of Mersete Hundred, of which I am first to treat, was a district on which the tide of ancient warfare seems to have ebbed and flowed with extraordinary vicissitude. Not less calculated are its monuments, its traditions, and its local names, to afford an ample field for modern speculation or controversy. The truth after which we have to grope is hidden, sometimes in Bardic verses of questionable genuineness and doubtful import, sometimes in the statements of rival Chroniclers, or in Legends, no two of wiiich, bearing upon any particular point, are found to be consistent. It is not my purpose to meddle largely with materials on which"], [787, "MAESBURY AND OSWESTRY. 317 I place such small reliance. The first part of my story must be told with a brevity proper to that very small amount of fact and probability which can be eliminated from a mass of conflicting and second-rate evidence. \u2014 The Romans quitted England early in the fifth century. There is no proof that their arms ever gained any point nearer to the site of modern Oswestry than Llanymynech Hill, which is six miles to the South. During the Roman \u00e6ra we conclude that the district about Oswestry was occupied by unconquered Cymry. If that people had any settlement or fortified station in the neighbourhood, it was doubtless at Hen Dinas, now called Old Oswestry. I learn from good authority that, iu its main features of construction, this vast earthwork of Hen Dinas closely resembles other border for tresses which have been attributed to Caractacus. In one respect it differs, viz. that there is no appearance of the Romans having re duced it. If the Cymry had a station at Hen Dinas, it may be still more plausibly asserted that they called the adjacent country the -fU-lara or JHaeslJtt, that is, the open field or champaign country. We shall see that such a word, afterwards combined with Saxon nouns, en tered largely into the nomenclature of the adjacent district. An earlier period than that of the Roman departure from Britain has been fixed upon as the \u00e6ra of CuitEtitia TOIetitrr, a King of the Stratclyde, or Cumbrian, Britains. He is said to have reigned from a.d. 328 to a.d. 389. How the district about Hen Dinas fell to this Chieftain's disposal we are not informed, but we are told that he gave it to one of his sons, Oswael, as a reward for expelling the Irish from Gwynedd, and that, thenceforth and therefore, the country was called Osweiling. This fable bears the stamp of a Cambro- British origin. It was invented to fortify, with the highest imaginable antiquity, a claim which the Welsh always asserted to the district in question. But of all falsehoods, that which is uttered with a circumstance, though it be the more plausible at first sight, is more open to after-detection. When we discover that the word Oswestry is founded on a much later etymology than that above as signed, we are tempted to doubt the whole story, if not the very existence of Oswael son of Cunedda. It is probable that, before the \u00e6ra of Penda, who, according to Bede, reigned over Mercia from 633 to 655, the Cymry had yielded Hen Dinas and its surrounding district to the advancing Saxons. Unless Penda, King of Mercia, were Master of the said district, it x. 40 b"], [788, "318 MAESBURY AND OSWESTRY. is difficult to see why he undertook its defence against Oswald, King of the Northumbrians, or why Oswald directed his invasion against this quarter. It is true that Cadwalla, Prince of Gwynedd, had been Penda's ally and Oswald's foe; but Cadwalla had fallen at Hexham some years before Oswald undertook his Mercian cam paign. The latter event is dated in 642. The rival armies met at \" Maser,\" as the district now under notice was called, and the Christian King, Oswald, was defeated and slain. At this point the very names of places and things become a better guide to chronolo gical truth than more expanded legends. \u2014 The Saxons called the battle in which Oswald fell the battle of Maserfeld, a name which consists of two words of identical meaning, the one British, the other Saxon. This was natural; \u2014 for the Saxon, not knowing what the British word Maes, or Maesdir, meant, could not feel the re dundancy of his own etymology.1 Within twenty years after Oswald's death, Mercia may be said to have been converted to Christianity. The scene of his last cam paign came to be respected as the field of a Martyrdom. While the events were yet fresh in men's minds, the neighbouring locali ties were marked with certain names which doubtless bore reference to some well-known circumstance in the late tragedy. For in stance, the spot, where Oswald's mangled remains had been hung on wooden crosses, by command of his pagan foe, was known to the Saxons as Oswald' s-treow (Oswald's tree), whde the adjacent Bri tains called it Croes Oswalt, or Oswald's-cross. Saint Oswald's Well also, doubtless derived its name from some circumstance connected with the Martyr's last hours, though the Legend which specifies that circumstance is too absurd to be worth repeating. Again, the village of Woolston, though it stands four miles distant from the scene of Oswald's death, probably got its name from some connection with him or his line of march. It was originally called Oswald's stane or Oswald's-tun, and it was still called Osulvestune in the ele venth century. We may now pass to the reign of Offa (757-794), during which was constructed that remarkable earthwork known as Offa's Dvke, and which, seeing that it runs considerably to the west of Maserfield, shows that region to have been, at Offa's \u00e6ra, an undoubted por tion of the Mercian territory. I here use the word Maserfield ad visedly ; for to talk of Oswestry at this period might lead to the supposition that such a place existed as a town or settlement. My 1 See the analogous case of Ludford (Vol. V. p. 238)."], [789, "319 MAESBURY AND OSWESTRY. distinct impression is, that Oswestry, as a town, owed a name in deed to the Saxon Legend which had consecrated its site, but owed its foundation to the Normans. The Saxon settlements in this district were numerous and important, though they did not include Oswestry. I mention two of them, which have distinct reference to the previous, or British, name of the province : they were Maes bury and Maesbrook. Of these Maesbury was the chief. It was, in short, a Manor of the Saxon Kings, and was Caput of the Hun dred which Domesday registers as the Hundred of Mersete, but which a truer orthography would describe as Maesete. In King Edward the Confessor's time, this important Manor was waste. That condition I imagine to have resulted from the alliance between Gryffyth ap Llewellyn, Prince of North Wales, and Algar, the rebel Earl of Mercia, whose frequent raids on the English Bor der were notorious, and, for a time, most successful. During this period, therefore, neither the Hundred of Mersete nor the Manor of Maesbury yielded any revenue to their Royal owner. It was consequent upon the forfeiture of Earls Morcar and Edwin (in 1071) that William the Conqueror conferred the Palatinate of Shropshire on Roger de Montgomery. Through the instrumentality of his Sheriff, Warin, Earl Roger gained a complete ascendency over all opponents, and particularly those of the Welsh Border. The words of Ordericus (already quoted1) are to that general effect; and they derive a remarkable and specific confirmation from many a line of the Domesday Record. \u2014 In the case now under notice, the Earl seems to have conferred, not only the Manor of Maesbury, but the Hundred of Mersete on this very Warin. The result was, that a Manor and Jurisdiction, which had been waste or profitless in the Confessor's reign, stand in Domesday as worth 40s. per annum to their Norman Lord, and as peaceably tenanted, in part at least, by Welshmen. Meanwhile, that is, a year or two before Domesday was compiled, Warin, the Sheriff, died. One act of his, in connection with our present subject, should be recorded in the exact terms with which Earl Roger, after Warin's decease, spoke of and sanctioned it. \u2014 Guarinus vero Vicecomes dedit eis (scilicet Monachis Sancti Petri) ecclesiam Sancti Oswaldi cum decima ejusdem vill\u00e6? \u2014 Here then is the earliest hint or indication that we have of a town of Oswestry ; and we see that it was founded by Normans. It began with a vill ; and a Church was already added ; \u2014 the vill i Supra, Vol. VII. p. 204. s Salop Chartulary, No. 2."], [790, "320 MAESBURY AND OSWESTRY. and the Church being built upon that part of the old Manor of Maesbury which had previously been known as Oswalds-treou. If there had ever been a Church at Maesbury, it was now transferred to Oswestry, and Oswestry, as a town, became in course of a few years the Caput, not only of Maesbury Manor, but of Mersete Hundred. This transfer, began by Warin, had probably a strate gical object, and. was duly seconded by his successor, Rainald, who built Oswestry Castle in the year, or two years, which immediately preceded Domesday. That Record marks the transitional state of things in an indirect, but a very instructive, way. The Manor, which it calls Meresberie, must be taken to mean Maesbury and Oswestry combined, but the name, Oswestry, not being as yet in official vogue, and not having any Saxon antitype, is not mentioned. The Church and Castle are however alluded to as existent, but nothing is said of the transfer of the former to Shrewsbury Abbey, and the latter is described by a strange name, on which I shall pre sently have to offer some further remark. The exact words of the Record are as follows.\u2014 Ipse Comes tenet Meresberie cum v Berewichis, et Rainaldus de eo. Rex Edwardus tenuit.

Crickheath, Cyninion, Llanforda, Middleton, Pentre-gaer, Sweeney, Trefarclawdd, Treflach, and Trefonen (nine townships of Oswestry), have no other Domesday antecedent, than if we may suppose some five of them to have been the said Berewicks.2 Six other town ships of modern Oswestry formed distinct Manors at the date of Domesday. As to why the Norman Scribes should call the Castle which Rainald had built, by the name Luure, or Luvre, we must I think go to the language of the Founders for a solution of that question. 1 Domesday, fo. 253, b, 1. Domesday, and Ifton Rhyn (which in cluded St. Martin's), was perhaps one of the Domesday Berewicks of Westone. 2 St. Martin's, though an ancient mem ber of Oswestry, was not perhaps as old aa"], [791, "321 OSWESTRY. If the name had been written L'GEuvre, its meaning and its appli cability to any great military work of the Normans will be at once apparent.1 After Domesday, the next ostensible mention of this Manor is in Earl Hugh's spurious Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey.2 The Earl is represented as giving decimam dominii de Oswaldestre, as if the said tithe was that of his own demesne. Earl Hugh's other Char ters to Shrewsbury Abbey, as well as William II.'s Confirmation, are silent about Warm's grants at Oswestry. Henry I.'s Confir mation treats the Church of St. Oswald as given by Rainald, Warin's Successor, and by Hugh, Warin's son, with consent of Earl Hugh.3 This is quite consistent with truth, for confirmatory grants are often thus spoken of as initiatory. Other Charters, relating to Oswestry Church, have beeu already quoted under Middle.4 Though they establish no other chronological fact, they assure us that, in Henry I.'s time, Oswestry Church was accounted the Mother Church of a district. Of Oswestry under Alan fitz Flaald (Rainald's successor), we know next to nothing ; for I cannot treat an allusion in the Fitz Warin Chronicle as teaching anything more than how a tradition may be distorted.5 We next learn, or rather hear, that Croes- Oswalt or Oswestry, was one of the three Cwmmwds which composed the Cantref of Trefred, and that this Cantref, with four others (forming the principality of Powis Vadog) was bestowed by Mere dith ap Blethyn, Prince of all Powis, on his eldest son, Madoc/' Oswestry would hereby be inferred to have been recovered by, or ceded to, the Welsh, in the reign of Henry I., for Meredith ap Ble thyn died at least two years before that Monarch. From a cognate and quite consistent authority we gather that \" at the close of the year 1148, Madoc, the son of Meredith ap Blethyn, did build the Castle of Oswestrie, and gave his nephewes, Owen and Meyric, the sonnes of Gruffyth ap Meredyth, his part of Cyvelioc\"?

The English Chronicles lend an air of some probability to the above picture of Welsh suc cesses. We know that previous to Henry I.'s death the Welsh had assumed a threatening aspect, nay, that that very event of his death prevented his invasion of Wales.1 We know too that Stephen's accession was followed by downright hostilities, in which two English Chiefs, Richard fitz Gilbert and Pagan fitz John, were slain, and in which Caus Castle was taken.2 It is more than pro bable that, during the remainder of Stephen's reign, and the exile of the first William fitz Alan, the Welsh obtained a further ascen dency on the Border. They possibly destroyed Oswestry Castle, and rebuilt it as a garrison for themselves, but their sway over this district was at best ephemeral. The third year of William fitz Alan's restoration had just set in, and the third year of Henry II.'s reign was yet current, when that Monarch invaded North Wales by way of Chester. Madoc ap Meredyth, Prince of Powis Vadog, acted in alliance with the King and received the King's pay. The general success of the campaign was unequivocal, though chequered by that singular reverse at Counsylth, which afterwards cost the Constable of England both his office and his inheritance. Madoc ap Meredyth and William fitz Alan (I) died in the same year (1160). Which of them died Lord of Oswestry shall now be made apparent : \u2014 for the following Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey is by William fitz Alan (I), and passed between 1155 and 1160. \u2014 Notum sit tarn presentibus quam futuris quod ego Willielmus filius Alani dedi Abbati et Monachis Sancti Petri Salopesburi\u00e6, quandam partem terr\u00e6 me\u00e6 in villa de Iselham3 et extra.

The entry on the Pipe-Roll has been already set forth, and the origin of such a name assigned.1 In 1161 we have seen Guy le Strange having custody of the three Castles of Clun, Blancminster, and Ruthin ; and we have had good proof that considerable works were in progress at Blancminster.2 In 1162, 1163, and 1164, the liveries of the garrison of Blancminster cost Guy le Strange \u00a318. 5s. per annum, which he charged upon his general receipts as Custos of the estates of Williani fitz Alan (II) . In 1165 a sum of \u00a34. 15s. was similarly charged in respect of the waste of Blancminster, while 200 servientes, employed there, had cost no more than \u00a3o. 3s. 9d. Other charges on the Pipe-Roll of this year have no direct relation to Oswestry, but, whereas they in dicate a state of Border warfare, I give them in a note.3 It was in July of this very year that Henry encamped near Oswestry, pre pared to encounter the Princes of North and South Wales, now allied with Owen Cyvelioc, Prince of Higher Powis.4 The result was a check to the English arms on the River Ceireoc, and a boot less encampment on the bleak heights of the Berwyn. The King, retiring at length to Chester, is said in his wrath to have put out the eyes of the Welsh hostages who had been in his custody since 1157. Guy le Strange, accounting at Michaelmas 1167 for two years' ferm of Fitz Alan's estates, deducts \u00a39. 10s. from his liabilities, be cause, in consequence of the late war, the revenues of Blancminster had been so much short of the average.5 He similarly deducts 55s. in 1168, 1169, and 1170, \u00a31. 15s. 8d. in 1171 and 1172, \u00a31. 3s. 8d. in 1173, and 15s. in 1174. Meanwhile his custody of Blancminster Castle, from 1165 to 1175, cost at the rate of J18. 5s. per annum for the maintenance of one knight, two Porters, and two Watchmen, 1 Supra, Vol. VII. page 238 \u2022 Vol. X. in Uberacione obsidum, 42s.

In 1166-7 the forty Servientes, who were also on permanent guard, cost \u00a3121. 6s. 8d., whilst 60 other Servientes who had been temporarily added to the garrison, by direction of Richard de Luci1 and the Barons of the Exchequer, cost \u00a339. 10s. In the same two years, a Well, sunk within the Castle, had cost \u00a35. 8s.; the Castle palisades (palilium) had cost 40s.; and the war-stores (municio) \u00a36. In 1168, 40 Servientes, for 29 weeks, and 20 Servientes, for 23 weeks, had cost (at ld. each per day) \u00a347. 5s.; and the Castle palisades \u00a32. 6s. Sd. In 1169, 20 Servientes, throughout the year, cost (at the same rate) \u00a330. 8s. 4d. ; and a house had been built within the Castle-walls for \u00a32. 13s. 4d. In 1170, 1171, 1172, 1173, and 1174, the charge of \u00a330. 8s. 4d. for 20 Servientes is in each year repeated. At Midsummer 1175 the same 20 Servientes had cost \u00a322. 16s. 3d., or three-quarters of a year's pay. Then Blancminster Castle was apparently handed over to young William fitz Alan. From these details we learn that one knight, two watchmen, two porters, and twenty men-at-arms, consti tuted the ordinary garrison of Oswestry Castle, and cost \u00a348. 13s. 4d. per annum. I may remark that \u00a32,000 of modern currency would be less than an equivalent for this outlay, and that it was more than double the expense which, 80 years later, was deemed sufficient to maintain the ordinary peace establishment of the Royal, but less exposed, Castle of Bridgnorth.3 If the greatest of the Lord Marchers of Shropshire enjoyed unbounded privileges, his feudal obligations were also of the highest. Of William fitz Alan (II) I have spoken at length in a former volume. The hospitality offered by him in 1188 to Archbishop Baldwin and Giraldus Cambrensis was rendered at Oswestry.3 There is a curious Charter of this William fitz Alan, whereby it would seem that one class of his Burgesses of Oswestry had merited superior favour by coinciding with his local plans. I can but offer a mutilated edition of this Charter, which seems to have passed about 1190-1200.\u2014 Seiant tarn presentes quam futuri quod ego Willielmus filius Wil lielmi filii Alani recepi in manu et protectione med Burgenses meos de Blancmoster, nominatim illos qui ballivo meo messuagia recepe runt ad emendacionem merchati mei, et ego eos contra omnes manu- 1 In October 1166 (for that was the real date of the event), Richard de Luci and G-eoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex (in the King's absence abroad) conducted an expedition against Wales.

The particulars of the campaign have been already given.2 It appears that the King left certain military stores (warnisturam) behind him at Oswestry, which were sold off by Reginald de Hesding, the Constable of Oswestry. A Writ-Close of May 25, 1212, orders the said Constable to give the money thus received to John le Strange, who was to convey it to Court.3 Other Writs of July 6, 1212, are addressed to John le Strange himself, and to Thomas de Erdinton, who are ordered to sell no more corn, wine, or other stores of the King at Album Mo nasterium, but to replace whatever corn they had already disposed of, and further to provide 100 fat kine and 3,000 head of geese and poultry, ready for transmission whithersoever the King might order. They were to inform the King whether, and how far, he coidd de pend upon the execution of his orders.4 On or about August 3rd, 1212, Robert de Vipont undertook, in the presence of John Mares chall, Thomas de Erdinton, and other Commissioners of King John, the custody of the four Castles of Album Monasterium, Chirk, Car rechova, and Eggelawe.5 A Writ of August 6, 1212, commands Robert de Vipont to give up 12 casks of wine, which were stowed in Blancminster Castle, to Thomas de Erdinton, who would dispose thereof in a way serviceable to the King.6 At this period King John's movements and councils were so uncertain as to account for the above contradictory orders and changeful appointments. We have seen in a former Volume that it was on August 2nd, 1212, to dispose of part of the said stores. Le Strange paid the whole \u00a360 in the King's Chamber at Kmgshaugh (Nottingham shire), on August 24, 1212. The receipt, then given by the King's Marshal, is al leged in acquittance of the debt on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 4 Henry III. 1 Harl. MS. 1981, fo. 24. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 246. 3 Claus.

That Baron died, young and childless, at his Castle of Clun, about Easter (April 19th) 1215. Soon afterwards, King John wrote to Thomas de Erdinton, as Sheriff of Salop and Staf- fordshire, to inquire what Knights of those Counties had acted against the Crown in the late disturbances. This Writ of King John, and Erdinton's reply thereto, have by some chance escaped enrolment.4 The document says so much in relation to the state of Shropshire at a particular crisis, that I give it in extenso. \u2014 The King's Writ runs as follows. \u2014 Johannes Dei gratia, fye, Vicecomiti Salop' et Stafford' salutem.

The Barons' assemblage at Brackley on April 27, 1215 (at which John fitz Alan was present), was succeeded, in June, by the short-lived pacification of Runnymead, and in October and Novem ber, by the famous siege of Rochester. In January and February 1216, the King's savage successes in the North drove the Barons to the still greater infamy of an alliance with Prince Louis of France, who landed in England towards the end of May. Meanwhile we have the very fewest particulars of events on the Welsh Borders. On May 6, 1215, King John, then at Reading, orders his Barons of the Exchequer to reimburse Thomas de Erdin ton for all his expenses in respect of the Castles of Shrewsbury, Oswestry, Shrawardine, Morton, Clun, Montgomery, Moretoin, and other Castles, which were (or had been) in his custody.1 In the end of July 1215, the King's short visit to Bridgnorth resulted in no apparent measures against the disaffected Knights of Shropshire. It was still a year later, and when Louis of France was in possession of London, when Alexander of Scotland had made a defiant, if not a i Rot. Claus.

The details are pecu liarly relevant to our present subject. \u2014 On July 21, 1216, the King was at Gloucester, on the 22nd and 23rd at Tewkesbury, on the 24th at Hereford. Quitting that City on the 27th, he appeared before Hay Castle, which he destroyed. On the 29th he returned to Hereford, and proceeded to Leominster on the 31st. On the 2nd of August Radnor Castle was destroyed, and John passed for ward to Kingsmead. On the 3rd he left Kingsmead, and appeared before John fitz Alan's Castle of Clun. What happened there we are not told. On the 4th the King was at Shrewsbury, and from the 6th to the 10th at Oswestry. He reduced the town to ashes, but does not appear to have effected a capture of the Castle. On the 11th he was back again at Shrewsbury, and passing to Bridg north on the 14th, finally quitted Shropshire on the 16th. We have seen that in August 1226 Oswestry was named by King Henry III. and Lewellyn as a place of conference between the latter Prince and certain Lords Marchers to whom he owed restitution. \u25a0- John fitz Alan was one of the King's Commissioners on the occasion. Again, on December 26, 1226, the King commissions John fitz Alan, the Sheriff of Shropshire, John le Strange, Bartholomew Turet, and Robert de Girros, to meet at Album Monasterium, on Sunday, January 17th following, and there arrange certain differences be tween William Pantulf and Madoc ap Griffin.2 On September 22, 1228, King Henry, then at Montgomery, empowers John fitz Alan to hold a yearly Fair, of four days' dura tion, at Album Monasterium.3 Though the rights of the Crown in respect of Fairs and Markets were jealously maintained in less privileged districts, I am surprised to see them in any way recog nized in such a case as that of Oswestry. Probably the object of the Writ was rather to legalize the attendance of strangers at this Fair, than to authorize the Fair itself. Another Writ- Close of September 19, 1233, seems to favour this idea. It enjoins the Badiffs of Shrewsbury to allow Merchants to carry their merchan dise as far as Album Monasterium.4 I have alluded to some mistrust of John fitz Alan which would seem to have been entertained by the King at the close of the year 1233.5 The consequence, as regarded Oswestry, was, that Hubert 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 20. 2 Claus.

Hose, with 9 other knights aud three Horse-Balisters, were placed in garrison at Blancmunster for 20 days, viz. from Sept. 28 to Oct. 17 inclusive. The cost of this measure was 2s. per day for each knight, and Is. per day for each Balistarius. It amounted to \u00a323, and was defrayed by the Sheriff of Shropshire, who charged the same to the Crown in the Pipe-Roll of 1233. Though the hostages which had been taken as security from John fitz Alan appear to have been liberated in February and May 1234, a Patent of July 1 following, perhaps indicates some fresh cause of distrust. Custody of the Honour of Grosmunt, Skencfrid, and Album Monasterium, is committed to Walerand Teutonicus during the Royal pleasure. I am not quite sure that Oswestry is the place here alluded to. We have seen that on the death of John fitz Alan (I) in 1240, custody of Oswestry Castle was for a time in the Crown by reason of the minority of his heir ; and that on May 24, 1244, the said heir having attained his majority, was entitled to receive the same at the hands of John le Strange, the King's Custos.1 A Patent of November 15, 1257, names Oswestry as the place where the Mes sengers of Lewellyn ap Griffith were to meet Peter de Montfort and John le Strange, \u2014 Commissioners of the King to negotiate a peace. Letters of safe-conduct, dated at Westminster, on December 15, 1257, seem to anticipate that Lewellyn and the King would them selves meet at Oswestry. A Patent of December 1257 empowers John fitz Alan to levy customs for a period of 5 years, with the object of walling his vill of Album Monasterium. In April 1258, we have seen that Sir William de Leighton was in office as Constable of Oswestry,2 while his Suzerain, John fitz Alan, was in high command as the King's General in the Marches.3 On the death of this Baron, in October 1267, a general valuation was made of his Shropshire estates. Of the total income of \u00a3141. 5s. Uff -, Oswestry contributed \u00a344. 12s. 5-W. His demesnes there, consisted of 4 carucates of arable land, of 8 solidates of meadow land, and of 4 Mills. Annual rents (\u00a34)', Pleas and perquisites of the local Court (\u00a32), Market-tolls (\u00a39 6s Sd), went to make up the valuation; and the Walcheria of Oswestry was computed to yield \u00a318. 3s. 3W. thereof. Of John fitz Alan (III), -\"*-d hls presumptuous estimate of the feudal immunities which attached to his Lordship in the Marches, I have said enough elsewhere.4 He died on March 18, 1272 ; and on June 25 following, another Extent of Oswaldestre was made by i Supra Vol. VII. pp. 252, 253-4. : \u2022 ' \" * Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 331, 254, 257. 42"], [800, "330 OSWESTRY. the King's Commissioners. This document is very copious in its details, but is unfortunately so defaced as to yield little or nothing to its Examinants.1 It was, with other Valuations, returned into the King's Court at Westminster on July 30, 1272, and forthwith a Writ-Close issued, assigning two-thirds of the deceased Baron's revenues to the Crown (as having custody of his infant heir), and one-third to Isabel de Mortimer, his Widow. This Document sup plies the deficiency caused by any effacement of the preceding In quest. The net revenue from Arundel, Clun, Shrawardine, Blanc minster, and the Walcheria of Blancminster, was \u00a3506. 8s. ld. (equal perhaps to \u00a325,000 per annum of modern currency). Of this revenue \u00a3337. 12s. ld. was allotted to the Crown, and \u00a3168. 16s. to the dower of Isabel de Mortimer. There was a separate valua tion and division of the eleven Advowsons which had belonged to the deceased ; so also was there a distinct enumeration and partition of the feudal services due from the various tenants of his different Baronies.2 Of the above total of \u00a3506. 8s. Id., Oswestry itself (that is, its demesnes, its Manor-Court,* its Mills, its tolls, its rents of burgages and other tenements) yielded \u00a388. 17s. 3d. ; while the Tenants of the Walcheria of Oswestry paid further rents or services amounting to \u00a342. 2s. 9\\d. The Burgages within and without the Bailey of the Castle are distinguished. The former were held by William, Clerk of Oswaldestre, by Agnes Roger, John le Salter, Mable Lumbard, and Alan Lumbard ; \u2014 the latter by Richard le Saltar and others. The various Manors which composed the Wal cheria of Oswestry were as follows, viz. Weston (Weston, near Oswestry), Coton (now Weston Cotton), Mesbir' (now Maesbury), Treveleth (Treflach), and Middleton ; the Vills which were accounted to belong to the same district were Tibeton (now lost), Trevelthol nel (now Treprenal), Blodowanhan (perhaps Blodwel), Clanordaffe (perhaps Glan-y-rafon), Cruchet (Crickheath) , Bren (now Bryn), Blodnorvaur (perhaps Cefn-Blodwel), Swine (Sweeney), Kahercohou (Carrechova), Suston (?), Radioners (Rhandir), Weston (Weston Rhyn), Yston (Ifton Rhyn), Trevenen (Trefonen), Fenches (?), Du deleston (Dudleston), Wigeton (Wigginton), Brongarth (Brony garth), and Travercleuche (Trefar-clawdd) . Besides their regular rents (included in the above estimate), the Tenants of the Walcheria of Oswestry were jointly subject to an assessment equivalent to 40 merks per annum. Its object was to supply the drink (poturam) of certain Serjeants of the Peace (Ser- i Inquis. 56 Hen. III., No. 36. 2 Rot. Claus. 56 Hen. III., m. 4."], [801, "331 OSWESTRY. vientium custodientium pacem) , who were appointed for the district. Another obligation of certain Tenants or vills related to the keep and conveyance of the Lord of Oswestry's hounds ; but it is implied by so obscure a sentence that I will not attempt to explain it further than to say that it was deemed equivalent to 13s. id. annual rent.1 Ihese various rents and revenues were divided in the proportions above indicated. The King having (inter alia) two-thirds of Os westry Mills, gave the same (realizing an income of \u00a311. 2s. 9d.) to Roger de Mortimer. As to the Advowsons of this district, that of the Chapel of Al bum Monasterium (by which I understand the Chapel of the Castle) was worth 10 merks, the Church of Blodwell was worth 10 merks, and the Church of Lanmenagh (Llanymynech) was worth 10 merks. All three were in the Diocese of St. Asaph. The King took the two former, and Isabel de Mortimer the last. Bogo de Knovill's acconnts, as Gustos of Oswestry on the part of the King, are pre served.

It iB of 32s., realized from the land of Mecheyn (which the King had conquered from Lewellyn \" his Rebel \"), between July 2 and July 20, 1277, when that custody also had been trans ferred to Roger le Strange.2 Some particulars of the history of Oswestry during the minority of Richard fitz Alan have been given in a former Volume.3 It was during this period, viz. on Dec. 6, 1283, that King Edward, being at Acton Burnell, expedited a Patent permitting the Bailiffs and Burgesses of Oswaldestre to levy customs for 20 years, from and after the ensuing feast of St. Thomas (Dec. 21), viz. to take lo?, for every measure of corn exposed for sale, and to levy other like duties in aid of the completion and repair of the town-walls.4 Another Patent, dated at Shrewsbury on December 17, 1283, deals diffusely with the same subject.5 On January 16, 1284, we find the King himself at St. Oswald, as Oswestry is in this instance called. Soon after he came of age, Richard fitz Alan, styling himself \" Earl of Arundell and Lord of Album Monasterium,\" inspected, recited, and confirmed the Charter whereby his Ancestor William fitz Alan (Ij, \"of good memory,\" had recognized the title of the Monks of Shrewsbury to the Church of Album Monasterium, with its Chapels, and to the Advowsons of Opton subtus Hagemone and Trohford. The Earl further inspected and confirmed all other con cessions and grants of his Ancestors to the said Monks. This Deed, or Inspeximus, is attested by Peter Corbet, Fulk fitz Warin, Bogo de Knogvill, Robert Corbet, Fulk Glas, and Peter de Eyton, Knights ; also by John de Hesthope, Ivo de Sulton, Robert de Sul ton, Robert de Say, and Robert de Bochenhall.6 It is dated at Schyreveworthdin (Shrawardine), on Tuesday in the feast of the Annunciation, 21 Edw. I. (a date which probably indicates March 25, 1292, rather than March 25, 1293). English Chronicles and Records supply the scantiest materials for ascertaining the true history of a Welsh outbreak, which took place in 1294-5, and which has usually been designated the \" In surrection of Madoc.\" It is clear however that the disturbance was of no ordinary character. It operated to prevent King Ed- 1 The estimate will be found exact to a penny. 2 Rot. Pipe, 5 Edw. I. 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 259. 4 * 5 Pat. 12 Edw. I., mm. 19, 18.

The destruction of the town and castle of Caernarvon, and the defeat of the Earl of Lincoln near Denbigh, are the best ascertained of the Welsh successes. A Welsh History, called Cam bria triumphans, is replete with details which accord well with such a title. The reduction of Oswestry, the defeat of John le Strange at Knockyn, and an advance towards Shrewsbury are announced among the achievements of \"Madoc, son of Llewellyn.\" It is certain that during this insurrection, viz. on June 24, 1295, King Edward was at Oswestry, and that, within the next two months Madoc was taken prisoner on Cefn Digolh (The Long Mountain near Caus) and carried to London. Holinshed gives St. Lawrence's day (August 10) 1295, as the day of Madoc's capture. At that date however the King had returned to Westminster and had held a Parliament there. From this period, it is intimated by one of the Chroniclers, \" the Welsh began to attend to the cultivation of the soil and the profits of commerce, so that at length the possession of property of their own made them less indifferent to its destruction.\" \u2014 It was well that the spirit of Welsh independence did thus give way to a spirit of self-improvement and self-reliance, though there is little poetry in the idea that a patriotism, once so vaunted, should become amenable to motives somewhat sordid. But the story contains a lesson for all times and all countries, exposing, as it does, the hol lowness of high-sounding words and pretensions. Even in our day Liberty, Nationality, and Independence, are the specious words which aid and cover the designs of masked treachery or intended robbery. Even in our day the Prophets of peace and benevolence are one whde convicted of insolent and malicious slander, and are usually found advocating that particular form of patriotism which seems best calculated to serve the material interests of the individual de- claimant. An Inquest taken at Oswestry, on May 18, 1302, after the death of Richard Earl of Arundel, shows that half of the local Jurors were of Welsh extraction. The Panel consisted of Richard de Camera, William le Engleis, Roger fitz John, John Lombard, John le Roter, John fitz Hamund, Yarevord ap Eynon of Grenterou, Blethin Loyd of Lanvorda, Bledin ap Eynon, Griffin Seys, Howel Vachan, and Meyler ap Yevaf.

The Castle was of no net value, because of the great expenses (more than \u00a310 per an num) attendant on its maintenance. In demesne were 140 acres of arable land and four water-mills, viz. the Barley Mill, Weston Mill, Cotton Mill, and Cadugan's-Mill. The Burgesses' rents amounted to \u00a37. 5s. Hid. per annum. William le Engleis alone paid \u00a31. Is. 6d. for 16 burgages and other tenements. Other burgesses named were John Marescall, Alice fitz Reyner, the Prioress of Bre wood, Juliana le Strange, William le Strange, John le Strange, and William de Chetewinde. There was a custom in the Manor called Treth Canidion. It was collected in alternate years on St. Andrew's day, and realized \u00a318. 7s. l\\d. biennially. Another custom called Trethmorcu realized \u00a31. 17s. per annum. The following vills are enumerated as members of Oswestry, viz. Welli-Cadugan, Ryn, Morton, Weston Ryn (where Wely Moylgogh paid a rent of 2s.

The average yearly income from the whole Manor of Oswestry, including half of the custom called Treth kanidion was \u00a363. 6s. 7\\d. The pacification of Wales and of the Border brought to Oswestry its share in the prosperity which it was the policy of Edward I. and some of his successors to secure for the Boroughs of the Kingdom. I should however mention that a Patent of the year 1304 is entitled De libertatibus pro hominibus de Oswaldestre ; but that, on exami nation, this document, so far from conferring any new franchises, only shows how tenaciously the Burgesses were guarding their ancient customs. A Burgess of Oswestry, if he wounded or maimed his fellow-citizen, was, according to the local law, amenable to an extreme penalty of 5 shillings. At the present moment, Edmund fitz Alan, being an infant, the King had given custody of Oswestry to his own Cousin, Amadeus, Earl of Savoy ; and Richard de Harley, the Earl's Seneschal, was in the habit of amercing quarrelsome Burgesses \u00a35 or \u00a310 for a single offence, without any formal trial. The said Richard further \" imprisoned the Burgesses, and com mitted other enormities.\" They complained to the King, and he, wishing to make the speediest amends, appointed, by a Patent of Oct. 24, four Commissioners (viz. Roger de Mortimer, William"], [805, "335 THE CHURCH. Trussell, William de Sutton, and Nicholas de Warwick) to inquire into the case. The Commissioners were to consult honest men, favourable to neither party, as to the customs of the district, viz. men of Salop, or of Fulk fitz Warin's Liberty at Whittington, or of Peter Corbet's, or of Roger le Strange's Liberties, at Caus and Ellesmere.1 The result of this inquiry has apparently been lost. OSWESTRY CHURCH. Of the foundation of Oswestry Church and its bestowal on Shrewsbury Abbey, I have necessarily said something, when treat ing of the foundation of the Town and Castle. The Church must be considered to have been transferred from Maesbury, and there fore, though itself a Norman foundation, it had all the character istics of the older Saxon establishment. It was, in short, the reputed Mother Church of an extensive district, and it was colle giate. The earlier Charters, Regal and Episcopal, which secured this Advowson to Shrewsbury Abbey, have been set forth under Middle Church.2 I have nothing further to say of them, except to note that the Charters of Bishops Clinton and Durdent prove that, in the first half of the 12th century, Oswestry was accounted to be in the Diocese of Chester. At that period it is probable that the Diocese of St. Asaph was as uncertainly defined with respect to that of Chester, as we know it to have been with respect to that of Hereford. When or how Oswestry was annexed to St. Asaph, it is vain to conjecture, but I think that the transfer was recognized as early as the time of Henry II., and I believe that no later Bishop of Chester than Walter Durdent has set up any claim to the spirit ual supremacy over this district. The further history of Oswestry Church is embodied chiefly in Charters. \u2014 About the year 1190 \"William, son of William fitz Alan, quitclaims to Shrewsbury Abbey the Advowson of the Church of St. Oswald of Album Monasterium, also two parts of the tithes of his demesnes in the said vill, which two parts appertained to the building-fund of the Church of St. Peter, also the third part of the same tithes, which third part appertained to the Church of St. Os wald (that is to the Incumbent thereof).

The Normans, in short, took a power to alienate their demesne- tithes, or parts thereof, and so far to deprive the Parochial estab- lishment. The Charter further indicates that St. Oswald was originally the Patron Saint of Oswestry Church, and that St. Asaph was now the Diocese of Oswestry. Soon after the above grant \" Reiner, Bishop of St. Asaph, certifies that he had seen and did confirm the Charter whereby William, son of William fitz Alan, gave to Shrewsbury Abbey two parts of his demesne-tithes of Album Monasterium, towards the building-fund of the said Abbey.\"1 Be- tween the years 1204 and 1210 \" Reiner, Bishop of St. Asaph, con- firms the Church of Album Monasterium, with the Chapel of St. Martin, to Shrewsbury Abbey.

The next step was the ordination of Os westry Vicarage. \u2014 There are several Charters relating to this, and to the institution of the first Vicar. One, dated at Shrews bury, on December 29, 1223, supplies the proximate date of all. It is the Bishop's Taxation of the Vicarage of Album Monasterium, and is attested by Sir John fitz Alan, Vivian de Rossall, and Roger de Sibbeton. Other Deeds give Bishop Reyner as admit ting and instituting Philip fitz Leofth, alias Philip, son of Philip de Letfchild, to the Vicarage of the Church of St. Oswald, which Vicarage is thus taxed. \u2014 \" The Vicar shall have all obla tions, obversions, and small tithes, and three messuages in Os westry.

He shall be liable to discharge the Bishop's synodals and all other burdens, and shall be content with the portion above assigned. All garbs, hay (i. e. corn and hay tithes), lands, and rents, are reserved to the Abbey.3 One of these Taxations of the Vicarage is attested by \" David de Witinton, then Dean; and John fitz Daniel.\"3 Meantime the Monks of Shrewsbury had been careful to oblite rate a claim to a certain Prebend or Portion in Oswestry Church, which would seem to have been urged by the then Lord of Powis Vadog. A Certificate in the Abbey Chartulary by Madoc ap Grif fin declares that \"the contention which had arisen between himself and the Abbey, concerning a certain portion, formerly held by one Seysil, in the Church of Album Monasterium, had at length been settled on August 17, before Masters Adam fitz Odo and Richard Sevs, Vicars for the Bishop of St. Asaph.\" He now resigns the said portion into the hands of the said Vicars.

In 1228 Hugh Foliot, Bishop of Hereford, issued a manifesto relative to the Abbot of Shrewsbury's rights as regarded Oswestry Church.2 This he did, I conceive, not as Diocesan, but as having had a general commission from Pope Honorius III. to adjudicate upon, and rectify, all wrongs done to the Abbey or its property.3 Between the years 1225 and 1232, Abraham, Bishop of St. Asaph, \" inspected, recited, and confirmed the Charter whereby his prede cessor, Reyner, had conceded Oswestry Church and St. Martin's Chapel to Shrewsbury Abbey.\" This is the subject of two Char ters.* Between the years 1233 and 1241, \"Hugh, Bishop of St. Asaph, inspected, recited, and confirmed the Charters of Abraham.\" Bishop Hugh also directed a new Taxation of the Vicarage, differ ing from the former in that it gives the Vicar only one messuage in Oswestry.5 Between the years 1232 and 1236 John fitz Alan receives under his protection all lands which the Abbot and Convent of Shrews bury had in the Hundred of Album Monasterium, and also their Church of Album Monasterium, with the Chapel of St. Martin and the other Chapels pertaining to the said Church.

His son, John fitz Alan (III), was a violent opponent of the Abbot of Shrewsbury's in- terests ; and it would seem that Anian (II) , who was consecrated Bishop of St. Asaph on October 21, 1268, sided with Fitz Alan. Hence arose Suits, both in the temporal and spiritual Courts, of which we have the following particulars. \u2014 In Michaelmas Term, 1269, the Abbot names Brother Lucas and Nicholas de Ruggele his Attorneys in a Plea of trespass and land, which he had against John fitz Alan.3 The Plea-Roll of Easter Term 1270 gives proof that this Suit was a double one. \u2014 The Placitum terr\u00e6 was as fol- lows. \u2014 John fitz Alan (II) had ejected the Abbot from certain lands in Blancmunster. John, his son and heir, still retained those lands, although he had frequently been admonished, both by the King and the Sheriff, to make restitution according to the laut of the dis- trict. He had also, though repeatedly summoned to appear coram Rege, failed to do so. Therefore the Sheriff had been ordered to distrain him, and to have his body now in Court. The Sheriff had faded, and was again ordered to take such measures by the 1st of July ensuing*.4 The Placitum transgressionis was, that \" John,' son of John fitz Alan (that is, John fitz Alan (III) ), had ejected the Abbot from his property, had levelled the Abbot's houses, and ap- propriated the Abbot's goods to the value of 60 merks ;\" that the King had enjoined the said John to make amends, on pain of a Royal procedure against him ; and that the said John had cared to do nothing, and had not yet appeared to the charge ; so the Court had already ordered the Sheriff that notwithstanding the Franchise of Blancmunster he should distrain the said John and compel his bodily appearance on the present day.

In one instance, the Sheriff sent word to the Court that \"Fitz Alan had nothing in his Bailiwick save the Manor of Shrawardine;\" but the Court repeated its former order, viz. \"to disregard the Franchise of Blancminster.\" On another occasion, Walter de Pedwardine, William fitz Hugh, and John de Westhope, were an nounced as Manucaptors for the Baron's appearance. John fitz Alan's death on March 18, 1272, seems to have stopped all pro ceedings in the temporal Courts. Meantime, a Suit had been pending in the Courts spiritual, of another kind. John fitz Alan (III) had even denied the right of the Abbot of Shrewsbury to the Advowson of Oswestry, and in the year 1269 had presented Walter de Hang-mere, Clerk, to the Church. Bishop Anian (II) recognized the Presentee, and ordered his Official for the district of Powys to institute and induct him.3 The Abbot of Shrewsbury at once appealed to the Court of Canterbury, alleging his impropriate right to the Church of St. Oswald de Albo Monas terio, and the wrong done by the Bishop in causing another Rector to be inducted. The Abbot further alleged \u00a3200 damages, suffered by his House, in the loss of its goods on this occasion. The Ab bot's appointment of his Proctors in this cause is dated August 24, 1 269, and, on October 14 following, the Court of Canterbury issued an inhibition, and a citation to appear, against Bishop Anian. On November 5 the cause was progressing, but was adjourned to De cember 9,3 when the Court ordered its Official to transmit to the Bishop a Copy of the Privileges granted to the Abbey by Pope Eugenius. Also the Court cited Walter de Engmere to appear, if he thought it his interest so to do. On an adjourned day (January 28, 1270) the said Walter appeared, and when the Abbot's Proctor accused the Bishop of contumacy in not appearing, Walter proposed that the Bishop should be dismissed from the suit, seeing that he had acted in the matter, not officially, but at the instance of the said Walter. On another adjourned day (March 7, 1273) the Court nullified all that the Bishop had done in the premises, since the Abbot had laid his appeal ; and Walter Hangmere was dismissed sine die.

How ever he had to give to Bishop Anian and his successors all the land which his Convent owned at Martin's Church.3 By a Certificate dated at London in May 1272, Lucas, Abbot of Shrewsbury, records how his Convent had been \" reinstated in possession of Oswestry Church by Bishop Anian, having been ejected therefrom by Johu fitz Alan, who had died on March 18th previous;\" \u2014 also how \"the said Bishop now authorized that appropriation which had existed from a time beyond memory, till John fitz Alan's unseemly and unjust act.\" The Abbot now therefore cancels the letters of his Convent, whereby \"Master Richard de Suham and another had been appointed Proctors to prosecute a Suit against the said Bishop and certain other persons.\"4 I presume that it was on this occasion, and that it was this Bishop Anian, who collated the Sacristan of Shrewsbury Abbey to the Church of Album Monasterium.5 On August 17, 1280, Archbishop Peckham, being at the Bishop of Lichfield' s Manor of Tachebrok, \" saw and approved\" the follow ing muniments of Shrewsbury Abbey, relative to the \"Church of St. Oswald, at Album Monasterium, in the Diocese of St. Asaph,\" viz. \" charter of collation (gift) by Roger, Earl of Salop, and by Warin Vicecomes; \u2014 a charter of Confirmation by John, son of Willian fitz Alan, afterwards Lord of Album Monasterium ;\u2014 letters of appropriation by Reyner (I), Reyner (II),6 and Anian, Bishops of St. Asaph ; letters of Confirmation by the Chapter of St. Asaph, were two Bishops of St. Asaph named Reyner in succession.

The enumeration may perhaps be of some local interest.

A Rent-Roll of Shrewsbury Abbey, drawn up about 1490, gives the tithes of Oswestry as worth \u00a338 per annum. The Valor of 1534 gives the Vicarage of Oswestre, in the Deanery of Marchia, as worth \u00a326. 13s. 4c?., which income was chargeable with \u00a32. 17s. 106?. deductions, viz. 40s. for lactualia;3 15s. for pro- curations; and 2s. 10c?. forthe average procurations payable at a Bishop's Visitation.4 The Rectory of Oswestre, appropriated to Shrewsbury, was at the same time found, by the scrutiny of the Parishioners, to be worth \u00a366. 13s. 4c?. per annum* But the Abbot ground that Bishop Reyner (if only one person) must have sat for the unusual term of 38 years. \u2014 3 Lactualia were the tithes of cheese, butter, and dairy produce, receivable by Incumbents from their Parishioners. It seems to have been a peculiarity of St. Asaph Diocese that the Incumbents handed over a portion of these dues to their Bishop. In fact, the Bishop's Lac tualia were as constant a charge on the benefices of that Diocese as the annual and triennial procurations .* and the income derivable from Lactualia was greater than that derived from the two kinds of pro curation combined. My transcript of the Shrewsbury Char tulary does not enable me to distinguish any two Letters of Appropriation as being the one by Reyner (I), the other by Reyner (II). Possibly a closer inspection of the Original might further elucidate this cu rious question ; for I can hardly suppose that Archbishop Peckham was mistaken in attributing the Deeds to two persons. 1 Harl.

Leland describes three such. \u2014 One, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, stood between the Stratllan (or Church Street) and the Port-dee (or South-eastern gate of the Town). Another, in the same quarter, was dedicated to St. Oswald, and was over St. Oswald's Well. A third, dedicated to St. Edith, stood North-east of the town, towards Chester.2 Of the Chapel within the Castle of Oswestry, we have minuter notices than of any of the above. A document in the Leiger-Book of Shrewsbury Abbey shows us that this Chapel had a distinct en dowment arising from tithes. The lands which yielded these tithes were, a Curtilage called Castelcroftes ,- a croft called Wynwallecroft , a croft under Redehulle ; a croft called Chykenewall ; a croft, late held by Thomas Lhw ; also Robbemedewecroft, with a meadow ; and the field called Cadogonesfeld. In the Valor of 1534-5 the \" Free Chapel within the Church of Oswestre\" is probably the Chapel now under notice. Its clear an nual value was \u00a35. 16s.3 Of course we suppose it to have been continuously in the patronage of the Lords of Oswestry Castle. OSWESTRY HOSPITAL. Leland's idea, that Oswestry was called Album Monasterium be cause its Church was preceded by a Monastery, was exactly the re verse of fact. It was called Album Monasterium after, and because, it had been ennobled by a grand Minster, or Church. The grave stones of certain Monks, which Leland heard of, as having been in the Cloisters of Oswestry Church, were no proof of any Monastery attached thereto. The Monuments in question were doubtless those of Shrewsbury Monks, members perhaps of some cell at Oswestry, but more probably resident there for the management of the Abbot's interests and estates. There was, however, at Oswestry a Hospital, \u00bb Leland talks of \" Llanvarda Chirch, now decaid.\" He adds,-\" Sum say this was the Paroch Chirch of Oswestre.'' This idea was probably the perversion of a tradition which really related to Maes bury, rather than Llanforda. 2 Leland's Itinerary, Lib.

He selected for his purpose land which then belonged to Oswestry Church, so that he had to deal partly with the Abbot of Shrewsbury (as Patron), and partly with certain Clerks or Pre- bendaries (as Incumbents) of the Church. Hence we have a Decd whereby \" Hugh, Abbot of Shrewsbury, at request of Reiner, Bi- shop of St. Asaph, conceded, gave, and confirmed to God, St. Mary, St. Michael, and St. John the Evangelist, the site of that Hospital which the said Reyner had founded in the territory of the Church, with the crofts on either side, and the messuage next to the Hos- pital, and 23 acres of land near the town, towards the west, with a little meadow, and 9 acres of land next to the Hospital itself, which 9 acres the Clerks of the foresaid Church had conceded to the Hos pital.\"1 Immediately after his purchase of a site and precinct, and stdl between the years 1204 and 1210, Bishop Reyner purchased the township of Willcot from John le Strange (II) as an endow ment for his Hospital. The price (70 merks) and other particulars of this transaction have been detailed under Ness.2 The above transfer of Church property, as well as the stability of the Hospital, seem to have required Papal recognition. I am inclined to date the following abstract of a Bull of Pope Innocent III. on December 23, 1211 (though the year is not given). \u2014 Innocentius Episcopus, fye, dilectis filiis, Magistro et fratribus Hospitalis AIM Monasterii salutem.

It must have been after July 1213 (when he first landed in England) that \" Stephen (de Langton) Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of England, and Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church,\" confirmed the Charter of Hugh, Abbot of Shrewsbury, and in spected, recited, and confirmed the above Charter of Bishop Reyner. The Archbishop's Deed is attested by \" Master Simon de Langton, his brother.\" Now it is clear, from what I have said under Willcot,4 that before the year 1210 Bishop Reyner had so negotiated with Haughmond Abbey, as that the Canons were willing to maintain a Chapel or Chantry in Oswestry Hospital. They were to have Will cot as an endowment of the said Chantry, or as a consideration for their undertaking. The second of the Charters of John le Strange (II), as I have quoted them under Willcot, shows the nature of this contract. Another Charter of the same John le Strange is still more to the point. \u2014 Johannes filius Johannis Extranei dedi et con cessi (Canonieis de Haghmon) totam villam de Winelecote cum mo lendino et vivario ejusdem, et cum duabus moris in le Marchis juxta Winelcote, fye.

Having allotted to the Canons of Haghmon the spiritual care, and so large a portion of the endowments, of his Hospital, Bishop Reyner's next step seems to have been an inconsistent one. Be- 1 Llansilin Church was now Collegiate, but afterwards appropriated to the Bishop and Canons of St. Asaph.

This consign ment runs as follows. \u2014 Omnibus Christi fidelibus, fye Reinerus d.g. fye salutem in Domino.

The Charter goes on to stipulate that, after Bishop Reyner's death, the administration of the Hospital shall remain to the Prior of the Hospitallers, quit of the Bishop's successors : but the Prior and his Brethren are to undertake to maintain therein always seven poor persons, and to supply every vacancy of the seven at once. The Charter then concludes as fol lows. \u2014 Nos vero omnia munimenta, qu\u00e6 habuimus de omnibus pos sessionibus predicte domus hospitalis, anno secundo Pontificates Honorii Pap\u00e6 III dictis Priori et fratribus reddidimus, et si qua in posterum totd vita nostra perquirere poterimus, eisdem reddemus.

The rupture which one would expect between the Canons of Haughmond and the Knights Hospitallers seem to have taken place at once. The quarrel was referred to Archbishop Langton, and the Canons of Haughmond obtained the same object in perpetuity, as Bishop Reyner had covenanted for himself and for his life. The following Deed by Nicholas, Abbot of Haughmond, shows the nature of the compromise.\u2014 Nicholas d.g. Abbas de Haghmon, fye Noveritis quod, cum causa verteretur coram Stephano d. g.

It would seem that the Seigneural Lords of Oswestry claimed to be tenants in fee-farm of the land on which Oswestry Hospital was built. This and other considerations seem to have compelled the Canons of Haughmond to go to John fitz Alan for a Confirmation in their favour. This they obtained between the years 1220 and 1230 ; perhaps in 1223-4, or before Bishop Reyner' s death. The Baron's Charter runs as follows. \u2014 Sciant omnes tarn presentes quam futuri quod ego Johannes filius Alani concessi et presenti cartd con firmavi Deo et Ecclesie Sti Johannis Evangeliste de Haghmon et Canonicis ibidem Deo servientibus, in liberam et perpetuam elemosy nam, pro salute anime mee et omnium antecessorum et heredum meorum donacionem quam Dominus Reynerus Episcopus de Sta Asaph fecit eis de Hospitali quod construxit apud Album Monaste rium, super terrain quam ego et heredes mei tenemus de Monachis Sa- 1 Halston, then a Preceptory of the Knights Hospitallers. himself but a Deputy for the Earl of Ches ter.

The following par ticulars are of more immediate local import. There was sometime an exchange between the Abbots of Shrewsbury and Haughmond. The former gave a culture under the Grange of William, Clerk of Oswaldestre, reaching up to the lands of the Sputte, also a croft under Caldwellemor, near the road to Middleton, also another place of land, all in exchange for a culture near the Fount of St. Oswald.2 About the year 1265, \" Roger Marescall of Oswestry gave to the Hospital of Sputte one plat of land lying between the land of the said Hospital and land of John Baker, which plot he held heredi tarily under Shrewsbury Abbey.

On March 18, 1341, the same Abbot demises to David Duy, Miller, his wife, Wladuse, and his daughter, Cecily, a piece of land at the Sputte.1 In the Valor of Henry VIII. the Abbot of Haughmond does not acknowledge any receipts from Oswestry, nor is a Hospital at Oswestry enumerated among the Religious Houses of the Dio cese of St. Asaph. However, the Abbot of Haughmond still con tinued to pay a portion or quit-rent of 20s. to the Commandery of Halston.3 LORDSHIP OP OSWESTRY. The nomenclature and condition of every village and place on the Welsh Border was necessarily liable to change. If it be diffi cult to say what were the Domesday members of Oswestry,3 it is no less difficult to determine how far Fitz Alan's territory expanded or contracted itself during the two centuries which passed between Domesday and the Conquest of Wales. Of most of the places which might thus be brought under question, I have no particulars to give, further than such as have transpired in my account of Oswestry itself. But some other places must be noticed, not be cause I can declare them to have been original members of Maes bury, or Oswestry, but because they have a semblance of having been sometime brought within the jurisdiction of Fitz Alan, as es tablished at Oswestry. \u2014 LLAN-Y-BLODWEL. We have seen that four vills, called Blodowanan, Clanordaffe, Bren, and Blodnorvaur, -were accounted in 1272 to be in the Wal cheria of Oswestry. I suppose Blodwel, Glan-y-rafon, Bryn, and Cefn-Blodwel to be the places indicated, and that the four involved a territory nearly equivalent to the present parish of Llan-y-Blod wel. We have further seen that, at the same period, the Church of Blodweiwas accounted to be in the patronage of the Fitz Alans, and went to the Crown during the minority of Richard fitz Alan, afterwards Earl of Arundel.4 In 1282, the King, as Custos of John fitz Alan's heir, presented William, son of Nicholas Zouch, to the vacant Church of Blodwas, in the Diocese of St. Asaph.5 Spytlel-House should be read) juxta Os westre, per annum, 20s. 1 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 162. 2 Valor Eccles.

The Taxation of 1291, placing the Church of Blodnol in the Deanery of Marchia, values the Rectory thereof at \u00a36, and the Vicarage at .\u20ac2. 13s. 4c?. per annum.1 I suppose that the Rectory had ere this been given to, and appropriated by, the Bishop of St. Asaph. The Valor of 1534-5 shows that one Jevan was then farm- ing the impropriate Rectory of Blodwell under the Bishop of St. Asaph, at a rent of 40s. per annum, as covenanted by a Capitular Lease.3 As to the Vicarage of Llanblodwell, it was valued at \u00a38. Os. 8c?. per annum, less 8s. 8c?. for the following charges ; viz. Bishop's Lactualia, 3s. 4d. ; yearly Procurations, 3s. 4c?. ; and pro curations at (the Bishop's) Visitations, 2s. per annum.3 The Parish of Llan-y-Blodwel, though bounded on three sides by Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire, has at all recorded periods beeu reputed to belong to Shropshire. This condition I take to be a result of its having belonged to the Walcheria of Oswestry. LLANYMYNECH, TREPRENAL, AND CARREGHOVA. When the Feodary of 1272 includes Treveltholnel and Kaher cohou in the Walcheria of Oswestry,4 I conclude that Treprenal and Carreghova are the two places meant, and that thus a good part of the present Parish of Llan-y-mynech owned the sway of Fitz Alan. This inference is strengthened by observing that John fitz Alan, then deceased, was the reputed Patron of the Church of Lan menagh. The said Church was worth 10 merks yearly, and the Advowson thereof was assigned as part of the dower of Isabeda de Mortimer, John fitz Alan's widow. It appears that Anian (II), Bishop of St. Asaph, deeming the Advowson of Llanymeueich to belong to his See, contested the same with Isabella de Mortimer, and, though a Suit in the Curia Regis was decided against him, he appealed to the Pope, and refused to admit Isabella de Mortimer's Presentee. King Edward I., in a Writ of his 10th year (1281-2), met the Bishop's refusal by an order on the Sheriff of Shropshire to distrain upon his goods.5 The immediate result does not appear, save that the Taxation of 1291 divides the Church of Lanemeneych (in the Deanery of Marchia and Diocese of St. Asaph) into a Rectory, worth \u00a37. 6s. 8d., and a Vicarage, worth \u00a33. 6s. 8c?. per annum.6 1 Pope Nich.

In the Valor of 1534-5 the Rectory of Llanemourth (in the Deanery of Marchia) was valued at \u00a313. 6s. 8c?. per annum, less 5s. for Bishop's Lactualia, 5s. for annual procurations, and 3s. Ad. for each year's average of the procurations payable at a Bishop's Visitation.4 On the 8th of May 1535, four Commissioners, appointed to make such valuations, swore the gross value of Lla'-y-mynyth Parsonage to be only \u00a310, without deducting Episcopal dues.5 CARKEGHOVA CASTLE. The township of Carreghova, though in the Parish of Llan-y mynech, is not in Shropshire. It forms an isolated portion of the County of Denbigh. Something in the ancient history of the dis trict seems to tally with this anomalous status. It was a portion of Wales, not originally annexed to the Walcheria of Oswestry or the Fief of Fitz Alan, but conquered soon after Domesday by one of the Norman Earls. It remained therefore a part of the Pala tinate of Shropshire, both under those Earls and under the Kings of England ; but, whereas it was obviously expedient for its Lords to keep it distinct from Fitz Alan's Hundred of Oswestry, it had an isolated or extra-hundredal status for a period, and finally, after the Conquest of Wales, was annexed to Denbighshire. The importance which attached to this district, probably arose in some traditional knowledge of its mineral wealth. There is good reason to suppose that the mines here, were first discovered by the Romans. That they were worked by one of our Plantagenet Kings, I shall fully prove in the sequel. Florence of Worcester tells us that in the year 1101, when Ro bert de Belesme Earl of Shrewsbury, commenced the fortification of Bridgnorth against King Henry, he also began another fortress in Walonia, in a place called Caroclove. In the following year too, 1-2-3 ziber Ruber Assavensis, fos. 44-b, j 5-a, 52 a.

The Earl certainly put great trust in this alliance, and it was one of King Henry's first moves, to dissolve the compact by bribing the Welshmen. The surrender of all Belesme's Castles is announced by Florence of Worcester in the same sentence with his banishment from England. We may presume that Carreghova Castle was included, and that thus it de volved to the Crown. I will next proceed to show how Henry IL, in the fifth year of his reign, was in possession of this district, and how he continued to maintain, for several years, an efficient garrison in the Castle. In the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1159, the Sheriff charges the King with the following item of outlay. \u2014 Et in Uberacione Coterellorum de Carlecoel \u00a315. 5s. By Coterelli, I here understand, not a class of inferior tenants of the soil, but a band of soldiers fitted for pr\u00e6 datory warfare, and placed in garrison at Carreghova.2 In the year 1160, the Sheriff's charges are more explicit. \u2014 Et in Uberacione 1 militis et 20 servientum, et Portarii et Vigilum de Carecoel \u00a325. 14s. 9c?. ; et in municione ejusdem Castri 73 sol' ; et in reparandd porta de Carrecoel 3s. 4d.

In this same year (1163) the Welsh Chronicle assures us that \" Owen Cyvelioc, Prince of one part of Powys, and Owen, younger son of Madoc (the then lately deceased Prince of Powis Vadoc, and the ally of Henry IL), got the Castle of Carrechova by Oswestrie and wasted it.\"3 The non-mention in the Pipe-Roll of 1164, of any specific expenses at Carrechova, seems to bear out this story. The Sheriff only charges a gross sum of \u00a390. 9s. 10c?. as the cost of the works and service of the King, and the liveries of his Servientes. In 1165 the Sheriff charges \u00a34.

Servientes during the quarter ending at Christmas 1164; but for the three quarters ending Michaelmas 1165 he not only charges several such general items, but a specific one of 20s. expended on the Mill of Carrecoen. I suppose that King Henry was again in possession of Carreghova, but we hear nothing more, for 29 years, as to any expenditure on its Castle or Garrison. At Michaelmas 1194, King Richard had been more than four months in Normandy. Archbishop Hubert was acting as Viceroy of England. John le Strange of Ness, and Ralph le Strange of Alveley, were Castellans of Carreghova, and the silver-mines of the district had now been worked more than three months for the Crown, under the superintendence of one Joseph, a Clerk of the Archbishop. This preamble will explain the following charges made by the Sheriff of Shropshire in the Pipe-Roll of 1194. \u2014 Et Josepho Clerico Archiepiscopi 71s. 4d. de Uberacione sud de 108 diebus, scilicet 8c?. in die, per breve Regis.1 Et pro 20 ligonibus, emptis et missis ad Castrum de Karakawain per idem breve Regis.

The charges on the Pipe-Roll of 1195 are still better worth atten tion, as bearing upon a piece of contemporary history. They are as follows. \u2014 Et servientibus retentis apud Karrecovan ad custodiam minarie \u00a34. 14s. lie?, per breve Archiepiscopi.

I have quoted, under Albright-lee,1 a Deed which passed on May 10, 1195, but which is dated \" on the Vigil of the Ascension which fed next after the Castle of Karrechove was surrendered by the Welsh to the King, through the agency of the Lord (Arch bishop) of Canterbury.\" This almost proves that during the spring of the year in which the above charges accrued on the Pipe-Roll, Carreghova Castle had been won and lost by the Welsh. Archbishop Hubert's presence in the West at this period is not recorded by the Chroniclers, Welsh or English. We know from better authority that he was at Lichfield on June 3, and at York on June 11, 1195. Such a course of movement is quite consistent with the supposition that he had previously fought a campaign on the Borders. His siege of Powys Castle in September 1196 was another feat of the same class. Appended to the Pipe-Roll of 1195 is a curious account of re ceipts and expenditure by Joseph Aaron, the Archbishop's Clerk, before mentioned. \u2014 He had received \u00a320. 11s. Id., the issues of the mines of Karacovein ; that is, between June 24, 1194, and May 21, 1195, he had received \u00a318. 3s. 5d. from that source, and since the latter date and up to August 1, 1195, he had received \u00a32. 7s. 8d. on like account.3 He had further received \u00a32. Os. 2d. de proficuo cambii, which I take to mean the profits of minting the specie yielded by the mines ; and he had had a loan of \u00a340 from the Sheriff of Worcestershire.3 Joseph Aaron's outgoings were \u00a32. Is.

The unprofitable issue of King Richard's mining experiment at Carreghova probably dictated its suspension. I should suppose that some silver coins of that Monarch might be found with a Shrews bury mint-mark, but I am unable to certify such a discovery. We have seen that on August 2nd, 1212, Robert de Vipont, being besieged in Mathraval Castle by the Welsh, was rescued by King John in person.1 Within the next 4 days, this Officer under took the custody of the four Castles of Oswestry, Chirk, Carre chova, and Eggelawe; and William Briwere, Peter fitz Herbert, Alan and Thomas Basset, John Marescall, and Thomas de Erdinton accepted, on the King's behalf, De Vipont's undertaking.3 At Mi chaelmas 1212 the Sheriff of Shropshire charges the King for cer tain outlays, incurred in rescuing the Castles of Haliwell and Ma drael, and for certain military works at Karracove and Madrael.3 On June 10, 1213, King John orders Robert de Vipont to deliver up Carrecova Castle to the custody of John le Strange ; and John Mares call was to see that this was done. A third Patent, addressed to John le Strange himself, appoints him Castellan of Carracova during the King's pleasure. After this I can find no more about the Castle or Mines of Carreghova. The former I take to have been disman tled or destroyed during the Welsh wars of Henry III. If it be indeed certain that the territory, called Kahercohou in the Feodary of 1272, was the district round Carrechova Castle, its annexation to the Walcheria of Oswestry was perhaps partial or ill defined. If the last John fitz Alan held it of the Crown (as probably he did), it must have been so held by some tenure, less absolute and free than that which secured the prescriptive immunities of the Hundred of Oswestry. posito ad rescucienda Castella de Haliwell (et) Madrael 100 li. per breve Regis.

I have little more to say of Weston and Weston Cotton than to quote a few Deeds from the Haughmond Chartulary, which relate to one or both localities, and which show that, as in the time of Rainald Vicecomes, so under the Fitz Alans, the principal Tenants here were Welshmen. \u2014 \" Ithel ab Theuet gave to St. John's Hos pitel at Oswestry four acres of land in the field of Weston.

In 1272 Wes ton Rhyn, Ifton Rhyn, Bron-y- garth, and Wigginton, which were all in St. Martin's Parish, were accounted as vills within the Wal cheria of Oswestry. As to St. Martin's itself, it was at first an ec clesiastical, rather than a manorial, foundation. It was, in short, a Chapel of Oswestry Church, founded in the Manor of Weston Rhyn, i Domesday, fo. 254, b, 2. 46"], [834, "WESTON RHYN AND ST. MARTIN'S. 362 before the reign of Henry II. This we know from William fitz Alan's Confirmation of Oswestry Church to Salop Abbey, which Con firmation (passing within the first six years of Henry II.'s reign) specifies the Chapel of Marlines-Cher ch as an affiliation of Oswestry. It would seem that there was a large glebe attached to St. Martin's Chapel, which glebe, when the Monks of Shrewsbury obtained an appropriation of Oswestry Church, passed to their demesne. Du ring some Border disturbance (between 1236 and 1270) this glebe was seized by certain Welshmen, whose names are given as Lowend fitz Rigered, David fitz Lewelyn, Meyler fitz Wyon, Ydenevet fitz Rees, Oweyn fitz Eynd, Eynon fitz Wybm, Ouwayn Ochhan, Ey non fitz Griffin, Kenewrec fitz Mayler, Kenewrech Vahhan, and Kenewrech fitz Adam. These eleven persons afterwards joined in a Quitclaim or surrender to Shrewsbury Abbey, wherein they re nounced all right in any land belonging to the Church of Martines chirch, and acknowledge that they had sometime occupied such land by their own presumption (propria temeritate). This Quitclaim was attested by Sir Griffin fitz Madoc, Lord of Bromefeld, Sir Howel his brother, and Eynon fitz Griffin. 1 Towards the close of Henry III.'s reign, one Lleucu, son of Owen, son of Goronw, made considerable purchases at St. Martin's and Ifton, either on behalf of Anian (II) , Bishop of St. Asaph, or with a view of making them over to that See. A list of these purchases is perhaps worth transcribing. \u2014 From Griffin ap Gronw, 3 acres at Iston, and 11 acres and a small meadow at Martinchurch ; from Kenwric Vachan, 4 acres, and from Kenwric Du, 5 acres, at Iston ; from David fitz Llewelin, a messuage and 4 acres at Martinchurch and in the fields thereof; from Llewarch ap Enin Mared, 3 acres* at Iston, opposite the house of Owen fitz Goronw; of Goronw fitz Maredut, 6 acres at Martinchurch ; of Gruffud ap Kenwrig, one acre, commonly called Llindir Menedus ; of Goronw gam fitz Maredut, one acre at Martinchurch ; of William ap Betris, one acre ; of Ken wric Parvus and Gruffud his brother, sons of Kenwric, 8 acres ; of Kenwric ap Llewelin, one messuage near the cemetery of Martin church ; of Kenwric Vachan, 3 acres in the corner near the Mdl ; of Griffin ap Goronw, 2 acres at Iston ; of John Goch, son of Llew elyn, 2 acres at Martinchurch, viz. one in the Mill-corner ; another near the said Lleucu's own house, with part of a messuage near the cemetery; of Anian fitz Goronw, two crofts over the hill (desuper clivum) of Iston ; of David Du, son of Llewelin, 2 acres at Martin- Salop Chartulary, No. 368-f."], [835, "WESTON RHYN AND ST.

By Deed dated at Album Monasterium, on April 6, 1271, John fitz Alan (III) , \" Lord of Arundel,\" conceded the above purchases to Anian, Bishop of St. Asaph, and his successors for ever; they paying a pair of gilt spurs, yearly, on the feast-day of St. John Baptist, at Oswestry Castle, in lieu of all services ; and every future Bishop being debarred from alienating the said lands, or any part thereof, from the Church of St. Asaph.1 In 1272, as before noticed, Anian, Bishop of St. Asaph, acquired for his See all the land which Shrewsbury Abbey had at Martin church.3 About 1285-90, Richard fitz Alan not only confirmed his father's concession to the See of St. Asaph, but granted to the Bishop and his successors 44 acres of land at Martinchurch, and the site of the Manor, and of the House thereto pertaining.3 The Taxation of 1291 is not veiy clear as to the value of this Episcopal estate at St. Martin's. I infer it to estimate 2 carucates and 3 bovates of land and other advantages, which the Bishop of St. Asaph had at St. Martin's and St. Leonard's, at \u00a321. 6s. 8d. per annum. The perquisites (that is, the Court-Fines) of the said two vills were put at \u00a31 more.4 The Valor of 1534-5 erroneously places the Bishop of St. Asaph's Manor of St. Martin in Flintshire. It was then at farm, for a rent of 20s. payable to the Bishop.5 Church of St. Martin's. As regards the Advowson and ap propriation of this Chapel, both were implied in the patronage and appropriation which the Monks of Shrewsbury had of the Mother Church of Oswestry. In 1291 the Rectory of St. Martin's was valued at \u00a36 per annum, the Vicarage at \u00a33. 6s. 8c?.6 The Church, like Oswestry, was in the Deanery of Marchia. In the year 1301 the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury demised one autumn's tithes of Martinchurch to the Bishop of St. Asaph for the large sum of 40 merks,7 which shows how fraudulent the return of 1291 must have been.

But part of the said Fee was held immediately under Fitz Alan, part under the heirs of Guy le Strange of Alveley (who held under De Haughton, who held under Fitz Alan), and part under de Haughton (who held under Fitz Alan). To which of these three constituents of the Fee of Knockyn we should annex Moreton I cannot determine. There is no evidence that there was any Lord of Moreton, mediate between Fitz Alan and Le Strange of Ness. We may, therefore, most reasonably assume that it was part of the Fief of new Feoffment which William fitz Alan (I) bestowed on John le Strange (I) or on his brother Hamo. In either case its heredi tary descent would be to Le St]\u201euge of Ness; and that family cer tainly held it for ages. John de Morton, who has been seen attest ing various Deeds about 1250-5,3 was perhaps Le Strange's Under- Tenant in this member of Knockin. Between the years 1269 and 1275, John le Strange (IV) mort gaged the vdl of Moreton to Rese ap Griffin for 120 merks, 100 of which were repaid during the said John's lifetime, in the shape of a Destrier, worth 80 merks, and a Palfrey, worth 20 merks. The mortgage was therefore paid off, aU but 20 merks, when King Ed ward, addressing himself to the affairs of the Border, found the vill in the hands of Rese ap Griffin, and therefore confiscated it.

It appears that Rainald's successors, the Fitz Alans, again separated the two Manors which Domesday had made one. They enfeoffed the Haughtons in Osbaston, and they enfeoffed the first John le Strange, or his brother Hamo,* in Kynaston. Following for the present the history of Osbaston only, I need not dwell on the subject of its first Feoffees, the Haughtons. I have sketched their descent and given some account of their Shrop shire tenures under Cleobury North, and Withington.5 A Chief of this family, about the time of Henry II.'s accession, unwilling 1 Inquis. 5 Edw.

The said Hamo died within five years after Henry II. became King, and, leaving no lawful issue, his eldest surviving brother, John, became his heir-at law. However, by some arrangement, before or soon after Hamo le Strange's death, Osbaston passed to the second brother, Guy le Strange, and Guy is said by tradition to have founded Knockyn Castle. Thus I understand the site of Knockyn Castle to have been originally in the Manor of Osbaston ; but a Castle, wherever founded, naturally became the caput of the Manor which included it ; so that thenceforth we hear little of Osbaston, but much of Knockyn. Shortly before his death, and so about the year 1179, \"Guido Extraneus gave to Haughmond Abbey the Mill of Osbertune toge ther with its site. Witnesses, \u2014 Ralph, the Grantor's son ; Adam, son of Hamo Extraneus; Simon de Petriponte, and William, Clerk.\"1 Ralph le Strange, son and heir of Guy, certainly suc ceeded him at Knockyn. He came of age about 1182, and died, without issue, in the summer of 1195. He probably founded Knockyn Chapel.

Witnesses, \u2014 William fitz Alan, John le Strange, William le Strange, and Jonas, Chaplain.\"3 On Ralph le Strange's death, in 1195, it seems to have been partly a question of expediency whether a frontier-fortress, like Knockyn, could remain advantageously as a matter of Coparcenery between his three sisters and coheirs, and partly a question of law whether the right heir of Hamo le Strange (the original Feoffee of De Haughton) was not John le Strange (II) of Ness and Cheswar dine. Both questions seem further to have been settled amicably, the three coheiresses of Ralph le Strange, as well as their husbands, agreeing to resign the territory of Knockin, for valuable considera tions, to their Cousin, John le Strange (II) . The three Fines by which this transfer was effected are very remarkable documents, and must be given at some length. The first passed at West minster, on January 27, 1197, and was between the said John of the one part, and Margery, sister of the late Ralph le Strange, and her husband of the other part.

John le Strange seems to have had greater difficulty in dealing with Matilda, the other coheiress of Ralph le Strange, whose hus band, Griffin ap Gervase Gohc, was a Welshman. The Fine levied between these respective parties was not enrolled till January 11, 1198, when Archbishop Hubert, Viceroy of England, happened to be at Shrewsbury, returning from a Welsh expedition which he had undertaken in behalf of David ap Owen, the dethroned Prince of North Wales. This Fine runs as follows. \u2014 Hee est finalis concordia, facta in Curia domini Regis apud Sa- lopbir', die dominied proximd post Epiphaniam Domini, anno regni Regis Ricardi nono, coram Domino H.

I must here quote a Charter of his (though it properly belongs to Knockyn Chapel) be cause it shows that he styles himself \" Lord of Knokin,\" and because it shows that his Feofi'ee at Kynaston and Dovaston (viz. Griffin Gohc) styled himself \" of Kinerton.\" \u2014 As Johannes Extraneus do minus de Knokin, he bids all his vassals and friends greeting, and informs them that \" he has given, &c, to Haughmon Abbey the New Chapel of Knokin, with the ground whereon it was built, and with free access thereto (itinere), and with all its appurtenances and obventions. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Hamo, the Grantor's brother, and Griffin de Kinerton.\"3 This Deed may safely be dated between 1197 and 1200. The Stranges of Ness and Knockyn gradually amassed, round the Castle of Knokyn, an extent of territory which made them for midable to their own Suzerains, the Fitz Alans ; but it must be remembered that they held Knockyn and Osbaston, not immediately under Fitz Alan, but, strictly speaking, under the heirs of Ralph le Strange, who held under De Haughton, who held under Fitz Alan. On Julv 1, 1250, a suit was pending between John fitz Alan (II) and John ie Strange (III). The former questioned the right of the latter to establish a Fair and Market at Knokyn, thereby in juring the Market and Fair of Blancmunster. John le Strange neither appeared on this occasion, nor on an adjourned day in Michaelmas Term. An attachment issued from Westminster against nim and his previous Sureties (Thomas Chipenol and Hugh de Clone) were ordered to be increased. In Michaelmas Term 1251, John fitz Alan makes Thomas de Ettingham, or Geoffrey de Vere, his Attorneys in this suit. The result I cannot find, but we here have a second proof that, in respect of Fairs and Markets, Fitz Alan's under Acton Burnell (Vol. VI. p. 123). 2 Haughmond Chartulary, fo. 132. i The allusion is to this Fine and to another of January 14, 1198, quoted 47 X."], [842, "I 370 OSBASTON AND KYNASTON. prerogative in Oswestry Hundred was acknowledged by himself to be less than absolute, nay, entirely subject to the common-law of England.1 In 1272, when the services of the Knights'-fees of Fitz Alan's Barony were divided between the Crown and Isabella de Mor timer, it is worth observing that Isabel's share included 2\\ fees, held by John le Strange, in Ruyton, Middle, and elsewhere, and also \" half a fee held by Robert de Holton in Knokin and Kny -thele \" (Knightley, Staffordshire). This proves that the Haughtons still maintained their mesne status at Knockyn, though perhaps it implied no advantage whatever. Again, according to the Inquest taken in 1276, after the death of John le Strange (IV), the Jurors found that he had held the Manor of Knokin under the heirs of Robert de Halhtone, but by what service the Jurors knew not. They valued the said Manor of Knokin at \u00a320 per annum, while the Walcheria attached thereto was estimated to yield \u00a330 more.3 John le Strange (VI) seems either to have made an entail of Knockyn, using the instrumentality or trusteeship of his brother, Hamo le Strange ; or else, we must understand that Knockyn had been devised to Hamo, by John le Strange (V), and that Hamo gave it up to his elder brother in exchange for Hunstanston.3 Be this as it may, on the death of John le Strange (VI), in 1311, the Inquest found that he had held the Manor of Knokyn conjointly with Isolda his wife, they having acquired it from Hamo le Strange, to hold to themselves and their bodily heirs. They held it \" under Thomas de Halghton, without rendering any service except homage.\" The Inquest further states that Knokyn Castle was of no value be yond the cost of its maintenance. The Jurors valued the Manor at \u00a37. 5s. 4c?. per annum, viz. \u00a35 of annual rent ; half a merk coming from Knokyn bridge (from the tolls levied there) ; 3s. 4c?. from Pleas and perquisites of Court ; and the remainder from 100 acres of arable land, and 2 acres of meadow-land (held in demesne), and from a water-mill.4 A Feodary of 21 Richard II. (1397-8) makes John le Strange of Knokyn immediate tenant of 2 knights'-fees under Fitz Alan, which two fees included Northslepe, Kynaston, Dovaston, Maesbrook, Moreton, Knokyn, and Osbaston.5 It is both possible and probable that ere this the mesne tenures of De Haughton, and of Ralph le 1 Vide supra, p. 328. 4 Inquis. 4 Edw.

If to the seven places named in this Inquest we add Melverley, we shall probably have a near estimate of what consti tuted the \"Fee of Knockyn \" in Richard II.'s reign. KNOCKYN CHURCH. I have shown that this Chapel was perhaps founded by Ralph le Strange, but certainly given by him to Haughmond Abbey about 1190-95. A Norman door in the Chancel of Knockyn Church is architectural evidence in favour of an antiquity at least as early as the reign of Richard I. There was at this time, and perhaps two centuries before, a Church at Kinnerley. Its Parish was extensive, including Knockyn, Osbas ton, Kynaston, and Dovaston. The three latter places still remain in Kinnerley Parish, but the foundation of a Chapel at Knockyn, at length made it an independent Parish. This, as we shall see, was not without some opposition and qualification in the first in stance. It would seem that, before or immediately after Ralph le Strange's grant to Haughmond, the respective Rectors of Kinner ley and Knockyn were at issue about tithes. Reyner, Bishop of St. Asaph, settled their dispute in a Charter which certainly passed before 1197. This Charter, abbreviated, runs as follows. \u2014 Reinerus Episcopus confirmavi convencionem factam inter ecclesiam de Ki nardesleg et Capellam de Knokin et earum personas, videlicet quod Persona de Knokin tenebit omnes decimas de Knokin et de Norslepe, tarn in novalibus quam aliis terris quecunque continentur intra divisas de Knokin et de Norslepe, et omnes obvenciones earundem villarum pr\u00e6ter sepulturam et medietatem testamenti, annuatim solvendo xnd. predicte ecclesie de Kinardesleg in festo Sancte Brigide.

Canons of Haughmond claimed the tithes of Osbaston as well as those of Knokin. Their differences were re ferred to Papal arbitration, and the Pope commissioned the Priors of St. Alban's and Dunstable, and the Archdeacon of St. Alban's, to settle the question. These Judges delegate gave sentence on June 1, 1248. They recited how the \" Prior and Brethren of the Hospital of Jerusalem in England \" had impleaded the Abbot of Haghmon for the great and small tithes of Knokyn Chapel, which the former claimed to belong to the Mother-Church of Kinardley. They further recited how Brother Thomas, Master of the Hospital lers of North and South Wales, had appeared before the Commis sion as representative of his Order, and had agreed to the following terms with the Abbot of Haghmon. \u2014 \" The Abbot released and gave up to Brother Thomas certain instruments concerning Kinnerley Church which had been obtained by his Convent : the Abbot also surrendered the tithes and the principale legatum of the whole land of Osberneston. In turn, Brother Thomas released to the Abbot all the tithes in dispute, except those of Osberneston, and released all the principale legatum of all Parishioners of the vdl of Knokin. The Abbot further allowed that, annually, on the day of St. Brigida the Virgin, the Parishioners of Knokin should attend the Mother- Church of Kynardeleg with their oblations. On the above consi derations, and on the payment of 12c?. yearly to Kynardeleg Church, the Prior and Brethren of the Hospitallers renounced all further dispute.\" The Commissioners confirmed this agreement, and sealed it in the presence, and at the request, of Master John de Kna, Proctor of the Hospitallers, and of Brother Alexander, Canon of Haghmon, Proctor of the A bbot.

On Dec. 13, 1298, John le Strange (V) expedited a more general Confirmation to Haughmond Abbey, which, though it merely touches on the subject of the Advowson of Knockyn, I give here in e\u00e6tenso. \u2014 Seiant presentes et futuri quod ego Johannes Extraneus quinlus, cartas et instrumenta qu\u00e6 habent viri religiosi Abbas et Conventus de Haghmon super donacionibus et possessionibus quas possident de an- tecessoribus meis inspexi que propriis duxi exprimenda vocabulis ; \u2014 advocacionem ecclesie de Hunstaneston cum omnibus pertinenciis suis, advocacionem ecclesie de Chesivardin cum perti nenciis suis advocacionem ecclesi\u00e6 de Knokyn cum pertinenciis suis, molendinum de Osberston cum pertinenciis suis, molendinum de Bruera stagnum et vivarium supra proximum, cum agistiamento aaue ex utraque parte et cum omnibus partineneiis suis, Caldecolam cum omnibus pertinenciis suis, totam terram Radulphi Hert quam 1 Pope Nich.

Abbot Richard now con cedes one-half the Chaplain's demand, \" to the end that he may more willingly support the burdens incumbent upon our chapel of Knokyn.\" John le Strange (VI) gave a general Confirmation to Haughmond Abbey, dated October 10, 1310. Part of this instrument has al ready been set forth. In confirms also the following. \u2014 Novam ca pellam de Knokyn cum solo in quo edificatur, cum libero ingressu et egressu ad earn ex omni parte. cum omnibus oblacionibus, obvencioni bus et suis proventibus quibuscunque : \u2014 Grangiam de Caldecote cum omnibus pertinenciis suis, cum licentia, quam do eis, sicut pater meus ante me fecit, approviandi se de totd bruerd seu vasto juxta Caldecote, qualitercunque voluerint, et dictam brueram seu vastum fossato et hayd include.ndi, et in defensd separata a qudcunque com munione et commund habendi et tenendi omni tempore anni, et in dictis bruerd et vasto edificandi, et extradendi seu assignandi tenen tibus, sicut sibi viderint expedire, prout carta patris mei loquitur. About this time, Richard, son of Laurence de Ludlow (of whom we have heard as a Prebendary of Westbury2), either founded or was Incumbent of a \" certain new Chapel,\" which was within \" the 1 Harl. MS. 449. Quatern. XI. fo. 6. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 59, 60."], [847, "KNOCKYN CHURCH. 375 bounds and limits of the Chapelry of Knokin.\" This Chapel, called \" the Chapel of St. John and St. David,\" seems to have caused a loss of certain oblations to Knockyn Chapel. The Abbot of Haugh mond actually appealed to Rome on the grievance, and the Pope appointed the Prior of Chirbury to adjudicate in the matter. The Prior's only recorded step is that he sat and heard the Abbot's libel or indictment, and certified that Richard de Ludlow had not chosen to appear (comparere non curavit).1 On August 9, 1328 (Tuesday after the feast of St. Oswald the Martyr), Roger le Strange, \" son of John le Strange the sixth,\" and Lord of Knokin, confirmed his father's Charter to Haughmond Abbey. On January 11, 1330, Brother Richard de Bachesworth, \"Pr\u00e6 ceptor of the House of St. John of Jerusalem, in North Wales,\" certifies the right, which the Abbot of Haghmon, as Impropriator of the Parochial Chapel of Knokyn, had to the \" New Chapel or Oratory of Saints John and David, situated without the said vill of Knokyn.\" The Pr\u00e6ceptor had examined the Abbot's muniments, and now undertakes that neither he nor his Order shad molest the Abbot in respect of any right or claim to the said Oratory, which it might otherwise be competent to the Brethren of the Hospital to allege. The Abbot, in short, and his Convent, were to receive for ever all oblations and other profits resulting from the said Oratory. \" Witnesses, \u2014 Master Robert de Preston, Stephen de Roshale, William de Smethcote, Walter Cresset, William Godezer, and others. Dated at Salop.\"3 On July 12, 1392, John Smert, Vicar of Knockyn, exchanged Livings with Henry D'Aderley, Incumbent of Moreton Corbet.3 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Rectory of Knokyng (in the Deanery of Marchia and Diocese of St. Asaph) as worth 100s. per annum* It does not appear, from the Abbot of Haughmond's contemporary return, that he derived anything from this Church. We mav conclude that he had abandoned, or been deprived of, his impropriate right ; for the Living remains a Rectory to this clay. Of Unuertenants in Osbaston and Knockyn I can add little to what has transpired above. The Abbot of Haughmond's MiU of Osbaston seems to have been afterwards called Moreton Mill. In Edward II.'s time, one Jevan Duy of Osberneston erected a second \u25a0 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 132. \" Harl. MS. 449. Quatern. XI. fo. vii.

The Abbot prosecuted him in the Hundred Court of Oswestree. At a sitting of the said Court, held December 20, 1323, it was agreed that Jevan Duy should become tenant of the Abbot's Mill at a fee farm rent of 30s.1 Caloecote and Norslepe have been mentioned above under circumstances which would indicate them to have been members of Knockyn. Both places are now lost. Of Caldecote I learn that it was given and confirmed to Haugh mond Abbey by \" John le Strange IV., son of John le Strange III.,\" and therefore given between 1269 and 1275. In the Taxation of 1291, the Abbot of Haimon is said to have three carucates of land and a Mill, and other advantages at Neuton and Caldecot, in the Diocese of St. Asaph ; \u2014 the whole worth \u00a34. 17s. 4c?. per annum. The Abbot's profits from live stock (3 cows and 200 sheep) at these places, were put at \u00a33. 3s.3 John le Strange V., Lord of Knokin, confirmed Caldecote to Gilbert, Abbot of Haghmon, on Dec. 13, 1297, and again (as we have seen above) on Dec. 13, 1298. The Confirmation of John le Strange VI., dated Oct. 10, 1310, has been also cited above. Roger le Strange, in his Confirmation of August 9, 1328, mentions that his Father had released the Abbey from a rent of two wether-sheep (multones) payable annually at Caldecote, and reiterates the said release.3 KYNASTON AND DOV ASTON. We have seen that in January 1198, John le Strange (II) held Kynaston and Dovaston. He held them probably sine medio, under Fitz Alan, and he then enfeoffed Griffin de Sutton and his wife Matilda in both vills, retaining thereoii the service of one-twelfth of a knight's-fee, and entailing the estate on the joint heirs of Griffin and Matilda, with a remainder, in default of such heirs, to himself.4 We have also seen that Griffin de Sutton, alias Griffin ap Gervase Gohc, was styled Griffin de Kinerton, in consequence of, and within a few years after, this feoffment.5 The tradition that the Kynastons were descended from Griffin de Sutton, and were sometime owners of Kynaston, is strongly sup ported by the above observations. This matter I have before can- 1 Haughmond Chartulary, fo. 145. 3 Haughmond Chartulary, fo. 42. 4 Supra, Vol. II. p. 113, note 18. 5 Supra, page 369. 2 Pope Nich. Taxation, pp. 289-b, 290-a.

I am still unable to show the exact mode of this descent, or to prove the descendants of Griffin de Sutton as in circumstantial possession of Kynaston. When the Feodary of 1397-8 includes Kynaston in the \" Fee of Knokyn,\" that implies no more than that John le Strange (VIII) held it immediately of Fitz Alan. It does not imply that he held it in demesne or had no Undertenant there. As yet, therefore, this curious tradition of the descent of the Ky nastons from Griffin de Sutton remains uncontradicted and pro bable, though not proved. JHaestoofc.

There can be little doubt that Sandford was the Berewick here alluded to ; and I think it very likely that the Knight who held Woolston under Rainald Vicecomes was ancestor of the Anglo- Norman family of Constantine. Certainly the Constantines held Woolston afterwards under Fitz Alan. Their tenancy is proved by a curious series of Charters. \u2014 The \u00e6ra of Thomas de Constantine (I) may be reckoned from 1196 to about 1240. It was perhaps early in that interval, that he, as \" Thomas, son of Richard de Constan tine,\" enfeoffed \"Roger fitz Dryn in a half-virgate at Sandford.\" Again, \" Roger fitz Dryn gave and quitclaimed to Haghmon Abbey, by the advice of Sir Robert the Chaplain, his brother, that half virgate which Thomas de Costentin had given him in the vill of Sonforde, together with 4| acres, of increment (de augmento), as the Charter of the said Thomas, in favour of the Grantor, did tes tify ; \u2014 which Charter the Grantor gave up to the Abbey.\" \" Tho mas de Constantine confirmed half a virgate in Sonforde\" to the said Abbey, but his Deed (perhaps by mistake) mentions William Dryn 1 Inquis. 4 Edw.

Witnesses,\u2014 Radulf de Constantine, Robert de Constantine, Thomas Cressett, William de Bodeham.1 Again, about 1225-1235, \" Thomas de Costentin gives in aug mentation of the aims at the gate of Haghmon Abbey, a rent of 1 lb. of cummin which Thomas de Caldecot used to pay on a half virgate in Sanford. Witnesses,\u2014 Vivian de Rosshall, Thomas, his son.\"1 About 1255-60, \"Angaret, daughter of Roger fitz Driw, of Sanford, quitclaims to Haghmon Abbey all her right in that half-virgate which Thomas de Constantine, son of Richard de Con stantine, gave to her father Roger, for his homage and service. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Thomas de Rosshall, and Vivian, his son.\"1 The above Deeds relate merely to Sandford. Another series re lates to Woolston itself. I am uncertain as to the date of a Deed whereby \" Thomas de Costentin concedes to the Canons of Hagh mon, that the stank of their Mill of Osberniston habeat octo pedes altitudinis desuper pontem de Tempres, ita quod refluxus aque libere jaceat super feodum meum de Osulveston. The Canons are however to pay the Grantor 2s. annual rent for the said concession, and the Grantor will warrant to them the said back-poundage of water. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir John fitz Alan, John le Strange, and Hamo, his brother.\"3 By another Deed, undated and untested, \"Thomas de Costantin, with consent of Thomas, his son and heir, gives and confirms to the same Canons exaltacionem stagni molendini eorum de Osberneston juxta Moreton, and leave to dig turves on the Gran tor's land in Osuluston.\"2 We know that Adam de Montgomery married the heiress of the Constantines. In 1272 the service of half a knight's-fee which he owed to Fitz Alan for Somforde and Oselstone was allotted to the dower of Isabel de Mortimer, widow of John fitz Alan (III). The Inquest taken in 1290, on Adam de Montgomery's death, accounts Sontford (i.e. Sandford and Woolston combined) as a member of Eaton Constantine. I have alluded to this before, and also shown that a Charter of Free Warren, obtained by Adam de Montgomery in 1285, extended to Sandford.3 In short, at this period and after wards, Sandford, rather than Woolston, seems to have been the re puted' Caput of the Manor now under notice. After Adam de Montgomery's death, Sandford does not seem to have remained with the heirs, either of himself or his wife, Isabella de Constantine. Walter de Hopton died seized of the Manor in 1305, holding it of the Earl of Arundel's heir for a seventh part of a knight's-fee.4 3 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 4. 4 Inquis. 33 Ed.

It is probable that Kinsall and EvenaU were two of the ancient Berewicks of Halston, but that, by some means or other, they be came annexed to Whittington, and were only reunited to Halston by a grant to the Hospitallers in Henry II.'s time. It is also pro bable that the Domesday Manor of Halston was far greater than it is at present, but in what direction the surplus lay I wiU not con jecture. Either one of the Fitz Alans, or some Tenant of theirs at Halston, gave the whole Manor to one of the great Military Orders of his time. Tanner describes Halston as \" a Preceptory which belonged first to the Knights Templars, and afterwards to the Hospitallers.\" I have no evidence of, and I greatly doubt, this antecedent seizin of the Templars. It is negatively certain that they had no such pos session in 1185, when their Shropshire tenures were enrolled with every appearance of care and completeness ; and it is positively cer tain that the Hospitallers were seated at Hallestan as early as the year 1221,3 and therefore nearly a century before they obtained a general reversion of the confiscated estates of the Templars. We have no very early Survey of the English estates of the Knights Hospitallers; but the ample digest of 1338 carefully dis tinguishes their original acquisitions from those which they obtained as Successors of the Templars. Their Bajulia de Halstan ranks among the former. 1 Printed Calendar of Inquisitions, Vo lume III. page 222. 2 Domesday, fo. 254, b, 2. 3 Vide supra, page 350, note 1."], [853, "381 HALSTON. In default of any intermediate Record between the year 1221 (when the Hospitallers were seated at Halston) and the Survey of 1338, I proceed at once to state whatever of interest may be ob tained from the latter record. \u2014 The Bajulia, or Bailiwick, of Halstan is described as in North Wales. It was not uncommon thus to describe places which were in the Marches, but the principal revenues of this Bailiwick came from Dongelwal, Carnow, and Lonothyn, places which were actually in North Wales. At Halstan itself, there was a messuage for the reception of the Brethren and of other Visitors, which with a garden and Dove-cot was valued as annually worth 10s. Od. The Assized rents of Halston were 40s. Od. Two hundred acres of (demesne) land produced . . . 66s. 8d. A Water-Mill produced yearly 13s. 4d.

Such balances were handed over to the Treasurer of the Order, in aid of its general purposes and responsibilities. At this period the Pr\u00e6ceptor of Halston was Philip de Luda. The brother-knight, resident with him, was Albinus de Nevill.3 The Valor of 1534-5 gives a full account of the Revenues of the Commandery of Hawston. The first item of receipt is \u00a313, pur porting to be \"the issues of demesne lands in the Lordship of Whytyngton.\" This item must be taken to include, and indeed mainly to refer to, the profits of the Manor of Halston. The in come from Customary Tenants in the Lordship of Ellesmere was \u00a34. Is. 6d. The Rectorial tithes of Ellesmere were \u00a355.
