This Treatise, in the present edition, has undergone so various and ex tensive alterations, that few of its original features will be recognized. The science of Mineralogy has made rapid progress in the six past years ; chemistry has opened to us a better knowledge of the nature and relations of compounds ; and philosophy has thrown new light on the principles of classification. To change is always seeming fickleness. But not to change with the advance of science, is worse ; it is persistence in error : arid, therefore, notwithstanding the former adoption of what has been called the \" Natural History System,\" and the pledge to its support given by the author, in supplying it with a Latin Nomenclature, the whole sys tem, its classes, orders, genera, and Latin names, have been rejected ; and even the trace of it, which the synonymy might perhaps rightly bear, has been discarded. The system has subserved its purpose in giving precision to the science, and displaying many of the natural groupings which chem istry was slow to recognize. But there are errors in its very foundation which make it false to nature in its most essential points : and in view of the character of these errors, we are willing it should be considered a relic of the past. Yet science is far from being ready with an acceptable substitute. Most chemical systems have been more artificial than the \" Natural\" system ; and doubts now hang over some of the principles of chemistry that are widest in their influence on classification. In view of the difficulties on either side, it was a point long questioned, whether to venture upon a classi fication that might be deemed most accordant with truth among the many doubts that surround the subject ; or to adopt one less strict to science, that might serve the convenience of the student for easy reference, and for the study of Mineralogy in its economical bearings, while at the same time it should exhibit many natural relations, and inculcate no false affili ations or distinctions of species. The latter alternative has been adopted : \u2014 the classification is offered simply as a convenient arrangement, and not an exhibition of the true affinities of species in the highest sense of the term. Among the silicates, however, it will be perceived that the group ings in the main are natural groupings ; and throughout the work, special"], [14, "6 PREFACE. care has been taken to inculcate, as far as possible, the true relations of species, both by remarks, and by an exhibition of them in tables. The system of classification which has been set aside for the arrange ment adopted, is presented in a tabular form in the latter part of the volume, and it is recommended as the preferable plan for arranging a cab inet ; since it groups together species that are fundamentally alike \u2014 that is, alike in chemical and crystallographic characters \u2014 and prominently exhibits the various cases of isomorphism and polymorphism among min erals. Special effort has been used to give completeness to the chemical de scriptions of species, while, at the same lime, crystallography has not been neglected. In the latter department, a Mathematical chapter has been added, after Naumann's system \u2014 the system generally adopted in Germany, and recommended by its simplicity ; and a second on the Drawing of Figures of Crystals. On the other side, the number of chemical analyses introduced has been increased fourfold, so that the student will have be fore him a full registry, in most cases, of all mineral analyses hitherto made that are worthy of confidence. Chemical formulas have been given, and also the various opinions of different authors, where the constitution of a species is still in doubt. The most recent investigations in foreign Works and Journals, as far as they have reached this country, have been examined, and the Treatise is therefore posted up to the hour of its leav ing the press. About one hundred new species have been added to the sci ence since the appearance of the preceding edition. In the department of American Mineralogy, no pains have been spared to render the Work as complete as the nature of the case admitted. And here the Author would gratefully acknowledge the valuable assistance he has received from various sources. He would especially mention his in debtedness to Dr. C. T. Jackson, for information upon the minerals of the Michigan Copper region, with Analyses of Telluric Bismuth of Vir ginia, and Chrysocolla, Apophyllite, and Analcime of Michigan, besides a description of Vermiculite, and an Analysis of this species in his lab oratory by R. Crossley ; also to Mr. Crossley, for an Analysis of Al gerite and Schorlomite ; \u2014 to J. E. Teschemacher of Boston, for observa tions on many species, including the Crystallized Black Copper Ore and a Vanadate from the Lake Superior region ; \u2014 to A. A. Hayes of Boston, for the blowpipe characters of Pyrrhite, and facts relating to Red Zinc Ore, and some other minerals ; \u2014 to M. Adolph Schlieper, now of Lowell, Mass., for an Analysis of a Volcanic Labradorite, and the Cummington Manganese Spar ; \u2014 to J. C. Booth of Philadelphia, for Analyses carried on in his laboratory of Emerylite, Euphyllite, Marmolite, an Iridescent Pyrites,"], [15, "7 PREFACE. a supposed Allanite, and other investigations, performed by T. H. Gar rett, J. D. Darrack, Ch. Hartshorne ; \u2014 to Wm. S. Vaux and T. F. Seal of Philadelphia, and L. White Williams of Westchester, Pa., for much important information on the localities and minerals of Penn sylvania and Delaware ; to H. WuRTZof New York for Analyses of Bru cite and Nemalite, besides a new species he has named Melanolite ; to Hon. T. L. Clingman of North Carolina for a catalogue of the North Carolina minerals ; to D. D. Owen and J. G. Norwood for an account of the minerals of Wisconsin, and other parts of the West ; \u2014 to B. Silli man, Jr., for Analyses of Emerylite, and other species, and for aid in the optical examination of the American Micas, besides help of various kinds in the progress of the Work ; \u2014 to H. Erni, assistant chemist in the Yale Laboratory, for Analyses of Danburite, Euphyllite, and a Feld spar ; \u2014 to W. J. Craw of the same laboratory, for Analyses of Emery lite, W. H. Brewer, for Analyses of Hudsonite, Vauxite, and a mica, (Margarodite), G. J. Brush, for Analyses of Williamsite, Deweylite and an Opal, J. B. Bunce, for an Analysis of Wollastonite ; \u2014 to T. S. Hunt, for a catalogue of the mineral localities of Canada, and a description of the new species, Nickel Vitriol ; \u2014 to Dr. F. B. Hough, for a catalogue of the localities of Northern New York, and a notice of the Capillary Pyrites of Antwerp ; \u2014 to O. P. Hubbard, for facts relating to the miner als of New Hampshire. With so many Collaborators, the Work must bear some evidence of progress in American Mineralogy. The persons here mentioned are in dependent of those whose publications have appeared during the past six years \u2014 among whom we cannot properly leave unnoticed the names of C. U. Shepard, J. D. Whitney of Boston, Wolcott Gibbs of New York, B. Silliman, Jr., J. E. Teschemacher, T. S. Hunt, F. Alger of Bos ton, L. C. Beck, \u2014 and W. Fisher, J. S. Kendall and G. J. Dickinson of Prof. Booth's Laboratory ; whose labors among American Minerals will be found reported under the species Schorlomite, Brookite, Ozarkite, Zir con, Gibbsite, Allophane, Boltonite, Unionite, Albite, Kyanite, Nuttalite, Serpentine, Algerite, Sodalite, Davyne, Brucite, Tetradymite, Garnet, Vivianite, Chondrodite, Pectolite, Wollastonite, Coracite or Pitchblende, Azorite, Chromic Iron, Black Copper, Pyroxene, Hornblende, Chladnite, and Shepardite. If we cannot number many new species, we may claim that our knowledge in numerous cases has been rendered more precise. Some species of uncertain titles have been restored to credit, while others have been stripped of their seeming claims. Among foreign laborers on American species, we should make honora ble mention of M. Hermann, who has analyzed the Manganese spar of"], [16, "8 PREFACE. Stirling and Cummington, Gibbsite, Jeffersonite, Columbite, Pennite, and the so-called Troostite ; \u2014 also of Prof. H. Rose, whose labors on Colum bite are well known ; \u2014 also of Rammelsberg, Delesse, Marignac, Da mour, and Kerndt, to whom the science is indebted for analyses or de scriptions of American Bismutite, Brookite (Arkansite), Schorlomite, Washingtonite, Chrysoberyl, and Wolfram. In the preparation of this edition, and especially the elaboration of its Chemical part, the Author has availed himself freely of the Chemical Mineralogy \u2014 \" Handworterbuch des Chemischen Theils der Mineralogie\" \u25a0 \u2014 of Rammelsberg, and its biennial Supplements, in which all that is pub- lished respecting the composition of minerals is posted up with a full- ness, discrimination, and erudition, that leaves little for another hand. The tables of Analyses are, to a great extent, only another arrangement of the very valuable Work of this distinguished Chemist and Mineralogist. The various Foreign Scientific Periodicals and Transactions have also been consulted, both of Britain, France, Germany, and Russia, and every care has been taken to insure correctness and accuracy. Many facts of very recent date, that were received through new publications, or as private communications from different contributors to the Work, subse quent to the printing of the earlier part of the volume, are contained in an Appendix ; and the reader will find it of use to him to add to the de- scriptions of species in the body of the volume, the number of the page in the Appendix where the mineral is again treated of. The introduction of a table of atomic weights places it in the power of any, who will take the little trouble needed to understand its use, to cal culate the results of analyses and test or compare their formulas. To the young student this will be found a most instructive exercise : and the proficient in the Science will appreciate the benefit of having a table of the kind at hand, arranged for easy reference. The Author is unwilling to close without again acknowledging his ob ligations for the Scientific aid he has so liberally received during the pro gress of the Work, and expressing the hope that the Treatise may not prove unworthy of its generous contributors. To expect to satisfy as re gards classification, would be the height of folly ; for it is a subject on which the widest diversity of opinion exists among the best authorities. The Work will accomplish its end if it contribute to the convenience of the student, and the progress of Mineralogical Science. New Haven, Conn., May, 1850."], [17, "TABLE OF CONTENTS. INTRODUCTION.

The productions of our globe naturally distribute themselves into three grand divisions, the Animal, the Vegetable, and the Mineral or Inorganic ; and our knowledge of the various kinds of objects in these departments constitutes the natural sciences, Zoology, Botany, and Mineralogy. The first two divisions include all beings possessed of vitality ; beings which increase by an assimilation of nutritive substances taken internally ; which arrive at maturity by a series of success ive developments ; whose parts are mutually dependent, and can not be separated without destroying the perfection ofthe individual ; which, after a certain period, lose the capability of continuing the usual functions of life, and consequently die. The powers of vitality being no longer present to counteract decomposition, death is soon followed by a complete destruction of the original living being. The third division, on the contrary, contains those natural ob jects that are not possessed of life ; objects which increase by accretion merely, or an external addition of particles unaltered by any powers of assimilation in the object ; which are equally per fect in the embryo state or at the earliest commencement of their formation, and in the enlarged individual ; whose individuality is not destroyed by a separation of parts ; whose formation is origi nally the result of chemical attraction, and, consequently, they are not, from their nature, necessarily liable to decomposition. There is thus a strong line of demarkation in nature between a"], [26, "18 INTRODUCTION. those bodies which live, grow, and die, and those which exist only by virtue of chemical and cohesive forces. The whole range of inorganic substances, whether made by art or existing in the earth's crust, fall into the last division, for they are produced by the same laws, and by like modes of aggregation. They constitute the Inorganic Kingdom. Minerals, as the term is used, are those species of this vast kingdom, that occur ready made in the earth's crust. They exist by no different forces from the compound that proceeds from the laboratory ; for it matters not whether sulphuric acid and lime come together in the work shop of art or nature ; whether the hand of man bring the mate rials into juxtaposition, a running brook, an exhaling spring, or a volcanic fumarole : the result in both cases is gypsum, identical in chemical, physical, and crystallographic characters. The Science of Mineralogy hence, treats of only a small part of the third king dom of nature. It includes here and there a species from the system \u2014 that is, those species that happen to have been formed by out-door processes. The limits of the department are not based on any grand points of difference between these and other inor ganic compounds ; they are assumed, in order to present together a collection of facts, which the student conveniently considers in one connection \u2014 facts relating to the natural productions of our globe. It is important, at the outset, that the distinctions here laid down be fully appreciated ; for very partial views of nature are received, when minerals are supposed to constitute a complete system in themselves. The explorer of some contracted territory might as well claim the species he finds to constitute exclusively a kingdom, as one who takes a wider portion or the whole of the earth's surface. The scope of the word mineral is conventional. It is convenient to include under it, all inorganic natural objects which are proper chemical compounds, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous ; and this convenience is a sufficient ground for the course. Moreover the physical conditions of solidity, liquidity, gaseity, are not even specific distinctions in the wide inorganic kingdom, and hence afford no reasonable or necessary limit to the mineral department. Mineralogy is closely related to the Science of Geology. The former considers minerals as independent bodies ; the latter, in"], [27, "INTRODUCTION. 19 their dependent relations, constituting soils and various rocks. It is the object of Mineralogy to describe the individual qualities of the several mineral species, while Geology treats of them only as associated in the structure of the earth. MINERALOGY: SUBDIVISIONS OF THE SUBJECT ADOPTED IN THE FOLLOWING TREATISE. 2. The aggregation of inorganic matter depends on a power called crystallization, or crystallogenic attraction, by the action of which minerals receive a regular structure and take on certain forms called crystals. This power is universal, like vitality in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and hence an inorganic species has as much its characteristic form as a plant or animal. Under the head of Crystallology, or, the Science of the Structure of Minerals, this subject occupies Part I. of the following treatise. Crystallology includes two sections ; 1. Crystallography, or, descriptions of the crystalline forms of minerals ; 2. Crystal logeny, or, the origin of the forms and structure of crystals. The properties of minerals come next under consideration : \u2014 First, those depending on the transmission and reflection of Light and Heat, on Electricity, Magnetism, Gravity, Cohesion, and also their relations to the senses of taste and smell, or their Taste and Odor. These, the Physical Properties of Minerals, constitute the subject of Part II. Second, those properties ascertained by the action of chemical reagents and the blowpipe. These, the Chemical Properties of Minerals, are considered in Part III. Next follow : \u2014 Part IV. On Taxonomy, or Classification. Part V.

In treating os the properties of minerals, a work on Mineralogy is necessarily brief. A full discussion of the relations of crystals to light, heat, and electricity, would lead us out of our proper science into Physics ; for it is by means of crystals that many of the fundamental laws of light, heat, and electricity, are exhibited.

CRYSTALLOLOGY, OR, THE SCIENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OP MINERALS. SECTION I. CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, 3. A crystal is an inorganic solid bounded by plane surfaces symmetrically arranged, and resulting from the forces of the constituent molecules. In its original signification, this term was applied only to crystals of quartz, which the ancient philosophers believed to be water congealed by intense cold. Hence the term, from xputfraXXoff, ice* It now includes all those regular solids that owe their formation to the attraction that produced the xputfraXXog of the ancients, or which, like that, possess a regular form, whatever may be the color or the degree of transparency or opacity. In brilliancy of lustre and symmetry of form, crystals, as they are found in nature, sometimes rival the most splendid gems from the hands of the lapidary. They occur of all sizes, from the merest microscopic point, to the diameter of a bushel measure.

One of the gigantic beryls from Acworth, New Hampshire, measures four feet in length, and two and a half in circumference. These large crystals never have the perfection and transparency of those of small size. 4. Variety and Constancy of Form. \u2014 Each mineral, as has been remarked, has its own mode of crystallization, by which it may be distinguished, just as we distinguish a plant by its charac- ters and mode of growth. For example, a crystal of calc spar is known at once by its angles, wherever it may have been found, and also by a peculiarity of internal structure. The same is true for other species : consequently, measurement of angles and exam- ination of structure have become the most important means of distinguishing minerals. This constancy of angle between similar planes in the same species, is a fact of the highest importance in the science : it is not absolutely perfect, owing to some causes hereafter to be stated, yet it admits of but little variation. 5. The variety of form presented by a single mineral, may be very great. Calc spar is found in double pyramids, in prisms, rhombohedrons, and many other forms ; pyrites, in cubes, octahe- drons, dodecahedrons ; and so with other species. But however great the number, all the forms in each case are referable to a single type and little skill is required to trace out extreme sim- plicity amid apparent complexness. The fundamental forms, as they are called, are modified by planes (termed secondary planes) on their edges or angles, which planes may be large or small, or may even obliterate the primary planes ; and these modifica- tions take place according to a simple unvarying law. Thus a multiplicity of crystalline shapes is produced for each species. It is the object of Crystallography to point out the number and rela- tions of these forms, and their internal structure ; and thence to explain the manner in which the study of them is available in science. All inorganic compounds \u2014 those of art as well as minerals \u2014 take on a crystalline structure ; and hence, this subject has the widest bearing, for it is the science of structure in the whole inor ganic world. Even the shapeless mass has a regular internal structure in its minute grains, of the same identical character with that of the crystal of like composition and species. I. SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. 6. The more simple forms of Crystals are the following : 1. Prisms. Prisms may have a 4-sided base, as in figures 1, 50, 69, 72, 87, and 92, on plates 1 and 2. When this base is square, and"], [39, "23 SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. the prism erect, as in figure 50, the form is a right square prism ;* the four lateral planes are equal rectangles, either longer or shorter than the breadth, according to the height of the prism. If these lat eral planes equal the basal, and like them are squares, the form is a cube, bounded by six equal squares. When the base is a rectangle instead of a square, the prism is a right rectangular prism, (figure 69, plate 3); In each of the forms mentioned the solid angles are eight in number, and are equal and rectangular. The edges, which are twelve in number, vary with the shape of the base and the height of the prism. In the cube the twelve are equal ; in the square prism the eight basal are equal, (four at each base), but they differ from the lateral ; in the rectangular prism, two at each base differ in length from the other two, and hence there are three sets of edges, four in each. Again, the base may be a rhomb, a form in which the sides are equal, (fig. 72, pi. 2) ; an erect prism with such a base is a right rhombic prism. As two of the angles in the base are obtuse, and two acute, the solid angles corresponding differ in like manner, two at each base ; and so also the lateral edges are two obtuse and two acute. But the four lateral faces, like the basal edges, will be equal. If, instead of a rhomb, the base is a rhomboid, a figure in which two oppposite sides are unequal to the other two, the four lateral faces will correspond to the basal edges, and only the opposites be equal. This form is the right rhomboidal prism, (fig. 87, pi. 2). Again, the base may be a rhomb, but the prism stand oblique on its base. Thus we have, as another form, an oblique rhombic prism, (fig. 91, pi. 2). As in the right rhombic prism, the basal edges are equal in length ; but from the inclination of the prism, two of these edges at each base are obtuse, and two acute. Such a prism may be longer or shorter than its breadth. If equal in length to its breadth, so that the lateral planes just equal the basal, the form is bounded by six equal planes like a cube, but having oblique angles ; it is called a rhombohedron. Again, an oblique prism may have a rhomboidal instead of a rhombic base, and is then an oblique rhomboidal prism, (fig. 103, pi. 2). The edges of each base are of four kinds, for two opposite are longer than the other two, and of each pair one is obtuse and * The following figures represent the forms of bases alluded to : \u2014 Square. Rectangle. Rliomb. Rhomboid. The square and rhomb have equal sides : the rectangle and rhomboid have only the opposites equal."], [40, "24 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. the other acute. So also with the solid angles ; the four are differ ent at each base. In this solid, therefore, only diagonally opposite edges are similar \u2014 that is, are equal in length and in the included angles ; and in the same manner, only opposite solid angles are equal, or consist of equal plane angles equally inclined. These particulars are readily understood from a model of the form. Prisms also occur, having a six-sided base ; and when the prism is a regular hexagon, and erect, it is called the hexagonal prism. 2. Octahedrons. \u2014 Octahedrons are 8-faced solids, as the term implies, derived from oxraxtc,, 8-times, and It^a, face. These faces are triangles, as in figures 4 and 52, and the form is like two 4-sided pyramids united base to base. Holding an octahedron with a solid angle uppermost, the upper and lower solid angles are called its vertical solid angles ; the other four, its lateral or basal solid angles ; and the horizontal plane in which the apices of the lateral solid angles lie, is the base of the octahedron. In the regular octahedron (fig. 4, pi. 1) the base is square, and the eight faces are equal equilateral triangles. The edges are twelve and all equal ; the faces incline upon one another at an angle of 109\u00b0 28' 16\", and have the plane angles all 60\u00b0. The solid angles are six, and mutually equal. Like the cube the solid is every way symmetrical. When the base is square and the vertical height greater or less than it is in the regular octahedron, (that is, the distance between the apices of the vertical solid angles greater or less than that be tween the apices of the lateral), the form is a right square octahe dron, (fig. 52, pi. 1), having the faces isosceles triangles, but not equilateral. The four basal edges are equal and similar, but they differ in length from the eight equal pyramidal edges, and also in the angle of the including planes. The vertical solid angles also differ in the plane angles of which they consist from the lateral or basal. The base in other octahedrons is rhombic, and in this case the form is called a right rhombic octahedron, (fig. 76, pi. 2). The basal edges are alike in length and other respects ; but as the plane angles of the base are of two kinds, two obtuse and two acute, so the pyramidal edges differ accordingly. 3. Dodecahedrons. \u2014 A dodecahedron is bounded by twelve faces ; the name is from Sis/Ssxa, twelve, and i5po.,face. In a common kind of dodecahedron, called the rhombic dodecahedron, these faces are equal rhombs, as shown in figure 7, plate 1. Like the -octahedron and cube, this solid is every way symmetrical. The interfacial angles are 120\u00b0; and the plane angles of the faces are 109\u00b0 28' 16\" and 70\u00b0 31' 44\". The edges are twenty-four and similar. The solid angles are fourteen in number, and of two kinds ; eight obtuse, formed by the meeting of three obtu-e plane angles, and six acute, enclosed each by four acute plane angles."], [41, "25 SYSTEMS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. 7. The thirteen solids which have been thus far enumerated and described have been called fundamental forms. Among crys tals there are many different prisms, octahedrons, and dodecahe drons, and forms of other kinds ; but they have close relations to the preceding, and are viewed as only modifications of them. They may be described after considering the classification of these forms. The terms base, lateral planes, basal, lateral, and pyramidal edges, similar edges and solid angles have been explained in the preceding remarks. The axes of crystals, as used in Crystallog raphy, are imaginary lines connecting points diagonally opposite : either the centres of opposite faces, or of opposite edges, or the apices of opposite solid angles. 8. The systems of crystallization to which all the various forms are referable, are six in number. I. Monometric or Tesseral System. \u2014 9. The cube, regular octa hedron, and rhombic dodecahedron, as already remarked, are alike in their perfect symmetry : the height, length, and breadth are equal. The three axes are of equal length, and intersect at right angles. In the cube (figure 1) these axes connect the centres of opposite faces; in the octahedron, the apices of opposite solid angles ; in the dodecahedron, the apices of opposite acute solid angles. The relations of these forms, and the correspondence in their axes, will be understood after a brief notice of the transitions between the forms. If the eight angles of a cube are sliced off evenly, keeping the planes equally inclined to the enclosing faces, we first obtain the form in fig. 2, plate 1 ; then that in figure 3, and finally a regular octahedron, (fig. 4) ; and the last disappearing point of each face of the cube is the apex of each solid angle of the octahedron. Hence, the axes of the former necessarily connect the apices of the solid angles of the latter. By cutting off as evenly the twelve edges of another cube, the knife being equally inclined to the faces, we have the form in figure 5; then figure 6; and finally a rhombic dodecahedron, (figure 7), with the axes of the cube connecting the same points in each. These forms are thus mutually derivable. Moreover, they are often presented by the same mineral species, as is exemplified in galena, pyrites, and the diamond. The process may be reversed, and the cube made from the octa hedron or dodecahedron, as will be readily understood from a comparison, in order, of figures 7, 6, 5, 1, and figures 4, 3, 2, 1. The octahedron also is changed to a rhombic dodecahedron by removing its twelve edges, (figure 9), and continuing the removal (as in figure 8) till the original faces are obliterated, thus producing the dodecahedron, (figure 7). The name Monometric alludes to the equality of the axes, and is 4"], [42, "26 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. from fjtovos, one, and (Asrpov, measure. Tesseral is from the Latin tessera, for cube or dice, and originally from the Greek word for four* II. Dimetric System. \u2014 10. Includes the right square prism, (fig. 50), and square octahedron, (fig. 52). The axes of the prism con nect the centres of opposite faces, and cross at right angles ; one is the vertical, the other two the lateral axes. The octahedron has the same relation to the prism as the regular octahedron to the cube ; the axes connect the apices of opposite solid angles. A replacement of the angles of the prism, (fig. 51), continued, leads to the octahedron. The vertical axis is a varying axis, and may be longer or shorter than the lateral ; the lateral are equal. Hence the name of the system, alluding to the two kinds of axes, from Sig, two-fold, and (jiSTpov, measure.^ III. Trimetric System. \u2014 11. Includes the right rectangular prism, (fig. 69), the right rhombic, (fig. 72), and the rhombic octahedron, (fig. 76). The three axes intersect at right angles, but are unequal. In the rectangular prism, the axes connect the centres of opposite faces ; in the rhombic prism, the vertical connects the centres of the basal faces, the\u00ablateral the centres of opposite lateral edges; in the octahedron, the axes connect the apices of opposite solid angles. By the transitions of these solids, it appears that these positions of the axes correspond throughout. If the lateral edges of a rectangular prism are removed parallel to a vertical diagonal plane, the form becomes finally a rhombic prism, as shown in figs. 70, 71, 72 ; and so if the lateral edges of a rhombic prism are in like manner removed, (figs. 71, 70), the result is a rectangular prism, (fig. 69). This relation of these two forms is shown in figure 73, which represents a rhombic prism within a rectangular ; the lateral faces of one prism are opposite the lateral edges of the other ; and the centre of the face of the rectangular prism where the axis terminates, is a point identical with the termination of the corresponding axis in the rhombic prism. It is, hence, apparent that the positions assigned to the axes are not arbitrary, but depend on the actual relations of the forms. Both of these prisms occur often in the same mineral. The rhombic octahedron, more over, is derived from the rectangular prism, by removing the solid angles of the latter, a process begun in fig. 74 ; and it comes from a rhombic prism by removing the basal edges of the prism, as shown in figs. 72, 75, 76. The axes are the same points precisely in the three forms. The longer lateral axis is called the macrodiagonal, (from fjiaxpoj, long), and the other the brachydiagonal, (from \u00a7p(*xus\u00bb * This is the Isometric system of Hausmann ; Tessidar of Mohs and Haidinger ; Tesseral of Naumann ; the Regular of G.

The name Trimetric alludes to the existence of axes of three kinds, (the three being unequal), and is from rpij, three-fold, and (jtE-rpov.* IV. Monoclinic System. \u2014 12. Includes the right rhomboidal and oblique rhombic prisms. In the oblique rhombic prism, the vertical axis connects the centres of the bases, and the lateral the centres of opposite lateral edges. The three axes are unequal ; the lateral, bb, cc, intersect one another at right angles ; the ver tical is at right angles with cc, but inclined to bb. Hence, among the three intersections, one is oblique. The axis cc, which is at right angles with the other two, is called the orthodiagonal, (from opdos, straight) ; and the axis bb, which is inclined to the vertical, is the clinodiagonal, (from xXivw, I incline). In the right rhomboidal prism, the axes connect the centres of opposite faces ; but they have the same relations as just explained : they are unequal, and there is one oblique intersection. To under stand the relations of these solids, the rhomboidal prism must be placed on a lateral plane for its base, as in fig. 88, and then the vertical axes in the forms correspond, as shown in fig. 92, in which both forms are combined. The removal of the edges e in 92, (as begun in fig. 90), produces finally the inner prism of 92, an oblique rhombic. The name monoclinic is from (jiovos, one, and xXivw, / incline. f V. Triclinic System.% \u2014 13. Includes the oblique rhomboidal prism. The three axes are unequal, and all intersect at oblique angles ; and hence the name, from rpij, three-times, and xXivu. The diclinic system has been indicated by Naumann, as occur ring in an artificial salt. It differs from the triclinic in having two of the intersections oblique and one rectangular. The pris matic form corresponding would be an oblique rectangular prism. VI. The Hexagonal or Rhombohedral System.^ \u2014 14. Includes the hexagonal prism and rhombohedron. The hexagonal prism has a vertical axis connecting the centres of the bases, and three equal lateral axes. The lateral axes connect the centres of the opposite lateral faces or opposite lateral edges ; and in each case (as is seen from the character of a regular hexagon), they intersect at angles of 60\u00b0 The rhombohedron has eight solid angles and twelve edges. Two of these angles, diagonally opposite, consist of three equal plane * This system is the Prismatic of Mohs ; the Rhombic and Anisometric of Naumann ; Binary of Weiss ; the Trimetric of Hausmann. f Tiiis system is the Hemi-prismatic of Mohs ; the Monoclinohedral of Naumann ; the Clino-rhombic of Kobell ; the Augitic of Haidinger : \u2014 Monoclinate of former editions ; the change in the termination is properly required by the Greek origin of the word.

The other six solid angles are similar. Placing the rhombohedron in position, (as in fig. 107), the apices of the six lateral solid angles are at equal distances around the vertical axes. There are also six literal edges, alike symmetrical in position, around this axis ; and there are three terminal edges meeting at each extremity of the vertical axis. Looking down from above on a rhombohedron thus placed, the symmetry of arrangement in the lateral edges is at once perceived ; and it is readily apprehended that lines connect ing the centres of opposite lateral edges, will be three in number, like those of the hexagonal prism, and will intersect at 60\u00b0. If the lateral edges are removed by planes parallel to the vertical axis, a regular hexagonal prism, terminated by a three-sided pyra mid, is formed, as shown in figs. 109, 110 ; and if the lateral angles are removed in an analogous manner, another similar form is produced, as seen in figs. 11], 112. The two differ only in the form of the planes R, at their extremities. When at the same time the vertical solid angle is removed, as in fig. 113, the terminal plane of the hexagonal prism is formed, (fig. 114). 15. A hexagonal prism is reduced to a rhombohedron by removing alike three alternate edges of one base, and three edges of the other base alternate with these, (shown begun by the dotted lines in 114), and continuing the removal till the original form is obliter ated ; or again, by removing in a corresponding manner, the alter nate solid angles. By the second method, fig. 1 14 would be reduced to 110, and finally to 107 ; by the first, 114 would be changed to 112, and then to 107. The hexagonal prism and rhombohedron are consequently closely related forms, and both are presented by calc spar and many other species. 16. Rhombohedrons are obtuse when the vertical axis is shorter than diagonals between the lateral solid angles ; and acute when it is longer. In the former case, (fig. 107), the terminal edges are obtuse ; the lateral acute ; the terminal solid angles are made by the meeting of three equal obtuse plane angles, and the lateral by the meeting of one obtuse and two acute plane angles. In acute rhombohedrons (fig. 108) the terminal edges are acute; the lateral obtuse ; the terminal solid angles are made by the meeting of three equal acute plane angles, and the lateral by the meeting of one acute and two obtuse plane angles. The cube may be viewed as the intermediate form, having angles of 90\u00b0. 17. Under these systems of crystallization, and the forms described, the variety of different forms or dimensions is unlimited. The cube, regular octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron, are of unvarying relative dimensions. But the right square prism has one axis (the vertical) unequal to the other two, and it may be"], [45, "29 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. longer or shorter in any proportions. The right rhombic prisms may be indefinitely various in the angles between the lateral faces ; and the oblique prisms may differ in other angles also. Rhombo hedrons may occur of every angle ; and the hexagonal prism, like the right square prism, may be indefinitely varied in the relation between the lateral and vertical axes. By these modes, and also by differences of structure hereafter to be explained, the actual fundamental forms of crystallization be come exceedingly numerous, although they belong to a few simple types. However numerous the kinds of substances existing in the inorganic kingdom, there is no limit, owing to this possible varia tion of dimensions, to the crystallographic distinctions which may exist among them.* II. MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. I. LAWS GOVERNING THE MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. 18. The number of forms among the crystals of a single species is often quite large, and there is at first much apparent difficulty in tracing their connections, or distinguishing any symmetry of arrangement. The law governing these modifications is, however, of the utmost simplicity. In its application, it is necessary to have fully in mind what is understood by similar edges and angles : \u2014 that with respect to edges, it signifies not merely alike in length, but also in the interfacial angle included at the edge ; and for solid angles, it implies their being enclosed by the same plane angles equal each to each, and belonging to planes alike equal. Thus in the cube, the edges are all similar. In the right square prism, the edges are also rectangular, vet the lateral are not equal to the basal in length, and therefore they are dissimilar. In the right rhombic * The relations of the several forms of crystals are elegantly exhibited by means of glass models. They may be made from common window or plate glass,' by cutting the glass in the form of the faces of the solid to be made, and then uniting them by means of glue. The author has generally found it convenient to glue a small cord be tween two adjacent pieces of glass, as the adhesion between the glass and the cord, by means of the glue, is much stronger than between two pieces of glass and glue alone. The forms thus far finished, may be rendered much firmer, and, at the same time, the glue and cord concealed, by covering the edges with narrow strips of paper, cut for the pur pose ; colored glazed paper is preferable, as it is less easily soded. The primaries, when completed, may be placed within a secondary, which afterwards can be closed up, and the edges papered. In this way, a primary may be enclosed within an}' of its seconda ries so as to exhibit clearly the relations of the two solids.

Laws of Symmetry. 19. Secondary planes do not occur indiscriminately on a crystal, but are governed by the following simple laws : \u2014 I. All the similar parts of a crystal may be simultaneously and similarly modified ; or, by the subordinate law, II. Half the similar parts of a crystal may be similarly modi fied, independently of the other half. The operation of the second law produces hemihedral forms of crystals, or forms with half the usual number of secondary planes. The forms resulting from the first law, are termed holohedral forms, from oXos, all, and iSpa, face. 20. Monometric System. \u2014 According to the first law, if a single edge of a cube, octahedron, or dodecahedron, be truncated, all will be simultaneously truncated, (fig. 5, plate 1), for all are similar. If an edge of the same be replaced by a plane inclined unequally on two adjacent faces, in order to retain the symmetry a second plane must occur on this edge similar to the first, as is represented in fig. 10. This becomes evident, when we consider that these planes occupy similar parts of the crystal, and agreeably to the above law, all similar parts must be simultaneously modified. This is termed, as stated in the note below, a bevelment. It also follows, that all the edges of the solids will be similarly beveled. * In describing the modifications of form, which follow, a few technical terms are employed. Replacement. An edge or angle is replaced, when cut off by one or more secondary planes. Truncation. An edge or angle is truncated, when the replacing plane is equally in clined to the adjacent faces, (figs. 2, a, and 5, e). Bevelment. An edge is beveled, when replaced by two planes, which are respectively inclined at equal angles to the adjacent faces, (fig. 10, e'). This term may be applied to an angle when replaced by three planes, each inclined at the same angle, to its adjacent face, (fig. 14). Truncation and bevelment can occur only on edges or angles formed by the meeting of equal planes. Planes on an edge, have their intersections with the adjoining faces parallel to the edge. The intersections of e' e', fig. 10, are parallel to the original edge. Planes on an angle intersect the basal face parallel to its diagonal. The intersection of a, with the basal P, (fig. 2 or 51), is parallel to the diagonal of P. Intermediary planes intersect the basal faces parallel neither to the diagonal nor to an edge, but have an intermediary situation. Such are planes o, o, (figs. 24 and 58). The facts stated above and in the following paragraphs, will be more thoroughly im pressed on the mind of the student, if he should perform the dissections here described with some convenient material, as chalk, raw potatoes, wax, or wood. By thus actually deriving one form from another, the mutual relations of the primary forms will be easily understood. Chalk is, for many reasons, preferable for this purpose. When the models are finished, their surfaces may be rendered quite hard, by covering them with a solution of gum or varnish."], [47, "31 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. Again, the truncation of one angle of a cube is necessarily ac companied by the truncation of all, (fig. 2). If a plane, situated as a', in fig. 14, occur on an angle of this solid, three similar planes may, and therefore must, occur on the same angle, one inclining on each face. In addition, similar planes will occur on all the angles. So, in the octahedron, we find four planes a', (fig 17), on each angle, one inclined on each face. If an intermediary plane (o', fig. 24) is situated on an angle of a cube, it will be accompanied by five others, or there will be six in all, and forty-eight in the whole solid, (fig. 24), since the number of similar parts about the angle is six. It should be observed, that two of these six planes may be said to belong to each edge. Thus, two to the edge P : P', two to the edge P' : P\", and that they cor respond to bevelments of the same edges. This correspondence may be seen by comparing figs. 24 and 10. For the same reason, there will be eight intermediary planes on each angle of the octahedron, two for each of the edges. It is manifest, that if one of these intermediary planes should be drop ped, the symmetry of the crystal would be destroyed. The obtuse and acute solid angles of the dodecahedron (\u00a7 6, 3), will be independently modified. The modifications are the same as in the cube and octahedron, (plate 1, figs. 6, 8, 13, 18, 27). 21. The exemplifications of the second law, are of frequent oc currence. They are of two kinds : either, 1. Half the similar angles, or edges, alternate in position, are modified independently of the other half ; or, 2. All the similar angles, or edges, are modified, but by half the regular number of planes. Figs. 28 and 33 are examples of the first kind of hemihedrism, in which half the angles of the cube are modified, while the remain ing half are unmodified. Fig. 42 is an instance of the second kind. All the edges are similarly replaced, but by one of the two beveling planes repre sented in fig. 10. The plane e' is enlarged in fig. 43. From this last figure, it will be observed, that the suppressed planes are those which were alternate, and that two planes e', incline on each face, P. The crystals have therefore a symmetrical character. Another instance may be observed in fig. 48, in which each angle of the cube is replaced by three out of the six intermediaries in fig. 24 ; that is, by half the number of planes which the first law would require. The first species of hemihedrism gives rise to solids, whose op posite planes are not parallel ; a face of a tetrahedron, for example, has no opposite parallel face. The same is true of all solids result ing from this kind of replacement, and it arises from the fact, that opposite parts of the crystal, producing these forms, as, for instance, the diagonally opposite angles in figs. 28 and 33, are not similarly modified. Hemihedral crystals of this kind have, therefore, been called inclined hemihedrons."], [48, "32 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 22. In hemihedrism of the second kind, the opposite parts of a crystal are similarly replaced, and, consequently, the hemihedrons proceeding from this kind of replacement have their opposite faces parallel. Such is the case in figs. 43 and 48. These solids have been termed parallel hemihedrons. The same mineral never presents both of these species of hemi hedrons. The former occurs in boracite, the latter in iron pyrites, and many other species. It is also important to observe, that min erals, whose crystals are hemihedrally modified, are invariably thus modified, if the secondary planes occur, in which the hemihedrism may take place. We may illustrate this statement by a reference, first, to the species iron pyrites, whose modifications follow the second of the above laws. The cubes of this species never occur with beveled or truncated edges, but (whenever the edges are modified) they are invariably replaced by planes unequally in clined to the adjacent faces. Again, the angles are never replaced by six intermediaries, but by three alternate, as in fig. 48. In boracite, we observe, that only one half of the angles are similarly replaced, and that the modified angles present all the planes re quired by the regular law for secondary planes ; or if all the angles are similarly replaced, as may be true, especially if the replacing plane is only a truncation, then one half the replacements will be very much larger than the other half. The edges of the cube are not affected by this species of hemihedrism, as it influences only the replacements of the angles. 23. Dimetric System. \u2014 The modifications of the basal and lateral edges of a square prism, take place independently, owing to their dissimilarity, (\u00a7 6). The lateral edges are included by equal planes, and, therefore, may be truncated or beveled, (figs. 61, 62). The basal edges are similarly replaced ; but being the intersections of unequal planes, they are never truncated or beveled. A plane on these edges, therefore, inclines unequally on the adja cent faces, (fig. 53). The similar intermediary planes can be but two in number. The two which incline on the base, are unlike those inclining on the lateral planes, because the base and lateral planes are dissimilar. These intermediary planes are represented in fig. 58. 24. Trimetric System. \u2014 The edges of the right rectangular prism are of three kinds, and those of each kind are according to the above law, independently modified, (figs. 70, 77, 78, 79). More over, none of them can be truncated or beveled, in consequence of the inequality of their including planes. Planes on the angles incline unequally on the three adjacent, unequal planes. The angles are similar, and therefore will be modified simultaneously, (fig. 74). The lateral edges of the right rhombic prism admit of trunca tion and bevelment, because of the equality of the lateral planes. The obtuse, however, are modified independently of the acute,"], [49, "33 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. (fig. 84). The obtuse solid angles, and the acute, are also inde pendent in their modifications. Each may have two like interme diary planes, (fig. 85). The replacements of the basal edges are similar and simultaneous, (fig. 75). 25. Monoclinic and Triclinic Systems. \u2014 In these systems, the ob liquity of the crystal makes the upper and lower parts in front dif ferent, one obtuse and the other acute, which leads to independent modifications. For other points the preceding remarks suffice. 26. Hexagonal System. \u2014 The vertical solid angles of the rhom bohedron are formed by the meeting of three equal planes, and equal plane angles. These angles may, therefore, be truncated, (fig. 113), or replaced by three or six similar planes. The edges, for a similar reason, may be either truncated or beveled. The ter minal edges, however, are replaced independently of the lateral, (figs. 109, 115, 117, 119). The lateral angles, six in number, are replaced simultaneously, (figs. Ill, 121). Two like intermediary planes may occur on each, (fig. 118). The similar parts in the rhombohedron and hexagonal prism being three, or some multiple of three, (excepting the vertical solid angles), the similar secondary planes are also three, or some multi ple of three. II. FORMS RESULTING FROM THE MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. 27. On a former page, it is shown how the truncation of the angles of a cube, when continued to the obliteration of the original faces, produces an octahedron ; the truncation of the edges of a cube or octahedron, a dodecahedron ; and conversely the trunca tion of the angles of an octahedron or the acute solid angles of a dodecahedron, yields a cube ; the truncation of the obtuse solid angles of a dodecahedron, an octahedron. The passage also of a square prism into a square octahedron was illustrated ; that of a right rhombic prism into a rhombic octahedron ; that of a right rhombic prism into a right rectangular prism ; that of an oblique rhombic prism into a right rhomboidal prism ; that of a rhombo hedron into a hexagonal prism, and the converse. There are many other resulting forms of a simple character which may be briefly reviewed. 1. Monometric System. The holohedral and hemihedral forms may be separately con sidered. 28. Holohedral Forms. a. Tetrahexahedron* \u2014 A bevelment of the edges of a cube is * Called Fluoroid by Haidinger, from its being a common form of fluor spar. 5"], [50, "34 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. represented in fig. 10, and the result of a continuation of the pro cess in fig. 11. This form is bounded by twenty-four triangular faces. The above name indicates its general resemblance to the cube or hexahedron, and at the same time expresses the number of its faces. It is derived from <rs<r\u00a3axij, four-times, &-, six, and ItSpa, face; the 4x6-faced solid. The planes e' in fig. 12, which are observed to replace the solid angles of the octahedron inclining at the same time on its edges, if extended to the obliteration of the primary faces, produce the same form as above, (fig. 11). The replacement of the six acute solid angles of the dodecahedron by four planes resting on the primaries, (fig. 13), if continued, results in the same solid. By varying the angle of the bevelment of the cube, tetrahexa hedrons of different angles may be produced. Those of most common occurrence have the following angles : Interfacial Angles.

Trisoctahedron. \u2014 The angles of the cube are represented as replaced by three planes in figs. 14 and 19 ; in one, they incline on the primary faces ; in the other, on the edges of the cube. The completed forms obtained by these replacements are seen in figs. 16 and 20. Fig. 15 is an intermediate form between 14 and 16. The resulting solids, though considerably unlike, have a general resem blance to octahedrons, with a three-sided pyramid substituted for each octahedral face. Like the octahedron, they are formed on the angles of the cube by a replacement by three planes instead of one, which accounts for their general resemblance to this solid. The name, trisoctahedron, is derived from tjij, three-times, Utu, eight, and l<5pa, face, 3x8-faced solid. The faces of one of these solids are four-sided or tetragonal, those of the other, three-sided or trigonal ; they are, therefore, distinguished by the names tetrag onal trisoctahedron and trigonal trisoctahedron. The more com mon name of the former is trapezohedron. The tetragonal trisoctahedron or trapezohedrons (fig. 16) may * The letters designating the angles refer to the figure, plate 1.

The trigonal trisoctahedron* proceeds from an octahedron, by beveling its twelve edges, (compare figs. 21 and 20); and from a dodecahedron, by a replacement of its six acute solid angles by four planes inclining on the edges.

Hexoctahedron.^ \u2014 Fig. 24 represents a cube, with six planes on each angle, and consequently forty-eight in all. The resulting solid is completed in fig. 25. Here, for each face of the octahedron is substituted a low six-sided pyramid. The name of this solid is derived from the Greek, Hjaxis, six-times, o'xru, eight, and kSpu, face, the 6x8-faced solid. A replacement of the angles of the octahedron by eight planes, produces a similar solid, (fig. 26). A bevelment of the twenty-four edges of the dodecahedron (fig. 27) also necessarily produces a forty -eight-faced solid. Others, differing in their angles, may re sult from a replacement of the six acute solid angles of the dode cahedron by eight planes, or the eight obtuse by six planes. Two occurring varieties have the following interfacial and plane angles : 1.

Hemi-trisoctahedron. \u2014 Fig. 33 represents a cube with its alternate angles replaced by three planes. The planes in this figure, when occurring on all the angles, give rise to the tetragonal trisoc tahedron, (fig. 16); occurring on but half, they produce the solid in fig. 34. The secondary planes in fig. 19, occurring on but half of the angles and enlarged, form the solid in fig. 40, which is a hemi hedral form of the trigonal trisoctahedron. Its faces are tetragonal, and it is, therefore, termed the tetragonal hemi-trisoctahedron. It is the deltohedron of Haidinger.* The former has trigonal faces, and is called the trigonal hemi trisoctahedron, or cuproid.\\ A crystal of gray copper ore has the following angles : 5=109\u00b0 28' 16\", C=146\u00b0 26' 33\". a= 31\u00b0 28' 56\", 6=117\u00b0 2' 8\"4 c. Hemi-hexoctahedron. \u2014 A solid of this kind is represented in fig. 41. It is formed by a replacement of half the angles of the cube, by six planes, similar to those in fig. 24. As the opposite faces are not parallel, it is an inclined hemi-hexoctahedron. If all the solid angles of the cube be replaced by three alternate planes, out of six intermediaries, (fig. 48), a hemihedral solid is formed, which is represented in fig. 49. It differs from the above in having parallel opposite faces, and is, therefore, a parallel hemi hexoctahedron, the diploid of Haidinger. A variety of inclined hemi-hexoctahedron, (boracitoid of Hai dinger), having the following angles, has been observed in boracite : .4=162\u00b0 14' 50'', 5=124\u00b0 51' C=144\u00b0 2' 58\".\u00a7 a= 40\u00b0 19' 7\", 6= 54\u00b0 21' 34\", c= 85\u00b0 19' 19\". d.

Dimetric System. 30. Holohedral Forms. The replacement of the solid angles of a square prism by a single plane each may take place at different inclinations for each set of planes, so that the number of different octahedrons which may be thus obtained is indefinite : they will differ in the length of the vertical axis, as compared with the lateral. Another series of octahedrons diagonal with these may be obtained by replacing the basal edges ofthe prism, (figs. 53, 54). Two intermediate planes on each angle of the prism (fig. 58) produce, if extended, a double eight-sided pyramid, (fig. 59) ; and by varying the inclination of these planes, different double eight-sided pyramids are formed ; the form is the zirconoid of Haidinger. A square prism, diagonal with the primary, may be obtained by truncating its lateral edges, (fig. 61), and an eight-sided prism by beveling the same, (begun in fig. 62). 31. Hemihedral Forms. A few hemihedral forms, appertaining to this class, are repre sented in figs. 63 to 67. The first is an irregular tetrahedron, called a sphenoid ; it is formed in a similar manner with the mo nometric tetrahedron. The second is the commencement of the solid represented in fig. 67, the disphene of Haidinger. Fig. 68 is another example of this hemihedrism. 3. Trimetric System 32. A replacement of the lateral edges of a right rectangular prism, has been stated to give rise to a rhombic prism ; and differ ent sets of planes will produce as many different rhombic prisms. If the edges e (fig. 69) are replaced, as in fig. 78, or the edges e, as in fig. 77, prisms will also be formed, which, from their horizon tal position, are called horizontal prisms, (fig. 79) ; one set pertain ing to the macrodiagonal and the other to the brachydiagonal. By replacements of the solid angles different octahedrons may be formed. From the rhombic prism, we may have different vertical * The signs of these solids are, C\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0f], [\u00b0\u00b0\u00b02J, and [f^h * 2 2 2"], [54, "38 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. rhombic prisms by beveling the front or side lateral edges ; and horizontal prisms by replacements of the obtuse or acute solid angles. Different octahedrons are formed by replacements of the basal edges ; and also by replacing either the obtuse or acute solid angles by two planes each, (figs. 85, 86). An instance of hemi hedrism in this system occurs in electric calamine, the extremities of whose prisms are modified unlike. 4. Monoclinic System 33. The replacement of the four lateral angles of an oblique rhombic prism produces a horizontal clinodiagonal prism, or cli nodome, (begun in a, fig. 98). The other four angles are not similar, two being obtuse and two acute, and hence they are not necessarily modified alike and together, (figs. 96, 97) ; but when re placed alike, they produce horizontal orthodiagonal prisms, and the two planes of each kind are called a hemiprism. The bevelment of either the acute or obtuse lateral edges (be gun in figure 100 with the front edge) produces, when extended, other oblique rhombic prisms of different angles. As in the right rhombic prism, octahedrons may be formed by replacing the basal edges or solid angles, but the solid is oblique and the planes are of two kinds ; each set is called a hemipyramid, one the positive, the other the negative. The relation of the rhombic prism to the right rhomboidal, being already explained, further illustration is not necessary. 5. Hexagonal System. 34. The derivation of two six-sided prisms from a rhombohe dron, has been fully explained in \u00a7 14 ; the one by a truncation of the six lateral edges, (figs. 109, 110); the other, by a replace ment ofthe six lateral angles, (figs. Ill, 112), by planes parallel to the vertical axis. The remaining parts of the primary faces on the first of the above prisms, are rhombic, (fig. 110); those on the second are pen tagonal, (fig. 112). This is an important distinction. In fig. 115, the lateral edges of a rhombohedron are beveled ; a greater extension of these secondary planes produces the solid rep resented in fig. 116, which is called a scalene dodecahedron or sca lenohedron, since its faces are scalene triangles and twelve in num ber. By other sets of beveling planes other scalenohedrons are formed, many of which occur in the species calcite. Bevelments of the terminal edges (fig. 117) continued, give rise to a similar solid. Replacements of the lateral angles, by two in termediary planes (fig. 118) produce other solids of the same kind. 35. A truncation of the terminal edges of the rhombohedron, is"], [55, "39 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. observed in fig. 119. Since these edges are six in number, three at one end of the crystal, alternating with three at the other, the solid formed by the extension of these planes, must be an oblique solid, contained under six equal faces : or, in a word, a rhombo hedron, (fig. 120 ; example, lenticular calc spar). It is much more obtuse than the primary. Moreover, because the lateral angles are six, and three alternate are nearer the lower extremity of the axis, and the remaining three near the upper extremity, the planes (a, a') on these angles, if not parallel to the vertical axis, incline alternately above and below, (fig. 121); and, therefore, by their extension, will give rise to rhombohedrons, (fig. 122, and fig. 2, under calcite). These rhombohedrons will differ in the lengths of their vertical axes, as these planes vary their inclina tion. The nearer they approach to parallelism to the vertical axis, the longer the axis of the rhombohedron; and the six-sided prism formed on these angles may be considered a rhombohedron, with an infinite axis. 36. An isosceles dodecahedron, (fig. 124) \u2014 so called, because its faces are isosceles triangles, \u2014 may be obtained from a rhombohe dron, by a replacement of the lateral angles, provided this replace ment is carried so far that the remaining primary faces (fig. 124) just equal the secondaries produced by the replacement. In figure 124, the alternate faces, R, R, are primary, and the remainder secondary. Such is the origin of the pyramidal termination of crystals of quartz, and the form is called by Haidinger the quart zoid. A similar solid may also be formed by replacing the basal edges or angles ofthe hexahedral prism, (e, fig. 125). Two intermediary planes on each angle of a hexagonal prism, produce, by their extension, a twenty-four-sided figure, formed of two twelve-sided pyramids placed base to base. This solid is rep resented in fig. 126. It is the berylloid of Haidinger. 37. Hemihedral forms often occur in the Hexagonal system, but usually in connection with holohedral. Under tourmaline, (fig. 3), is represented a six-sided prism of this mineral, differently termi nated at its two extremities. The secondary faces a', a', at the upper extremity, replace the lateral angles ; the secondary faces, e, e, e, at the lower, truncate the terminal edges ; the three planes a, a, which truncate the alternate edges of the six-sided prism, replace alternate lateral angles of the primary. The six planes (e) which compose the hexagonal prism in this mineral, are formed on the six lateral edges, (not on the angles). We arrive at this conclusion, by observing, that the faces R, if the planes a1 were removed, would be rhombic and not pentagonal. The hemihedral forms of tourmaline are inclined hemihedral, since the faces of one extremity are not parallel to those of the other. In apatite (see fig. 2) there is an example of hemihedrism of the parallel kind. The planes o o' are two out of four such planes on each angle which holohedrism would require. A similar kind of hemihedrism"], [56, "40 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. is seen in figure 6 and 7, under quartz ; and as the planes are spiral in position, turning to the right or left, it is called gyroidal hemi hedrism by Haidinger. A triangular prism, a hemihedral form of the hexagonal prism, is of frequent occurrence in crystals of tourmaline.* * On Lettering Figures of Crystals. \u2014 Some difficulty is occasionally experienced by the young mineralogist in reading the figures of crystals, or, in other words, in determin ing the particular situation of each secondary plane. Much aid may be derived from a simple system of notation, in which letters on the planes shall designate the edge or angle on which these planes are situated. . The following system is proposed for this purpose : In applying the following principles, a few of the fundamental forms are supposed to have a certain position. The right rhombic prism should be placed with an obtuse lateral edge towards the observer ; the right rhomboidal, (except for the lettering of its primary planes,) on its rectangular base, as in fig. 88 ; the oblique rhombic and rhomboidal prisms, with the dom inant solid angle in front ; it is immaterial whether at the inferior or superior base. Farther than this, no attention need be paid to the situation of these solids. The primary planes of prisms, when alike, as in the cube, are lettered P ; if unlike, the letter P is retained for the basal, and M used for the lateral planes ; and, finally, if the lateral are unlike, the larger lateral is lettered M, the smaller T, or the former m, and the latter m- (See figs. 69, 103). The primary faces of the rhombohedron will be lettered R ; those of the octahedron A ; those of the rhombic dodecahedron, E. (See figs. 3, 4, 1, 107). In general, the letter e may be applied to planes on the edges, a, to planes on the angles, and o, to intermediaries. If the basal edges differ from the lateral, as in the prisms, the Roman e may be retained for the basal, and the italic e for the lateral. If any of the edges are oblique, we may distinguish the obtuse by the mark , the acute by the mark \u2014 , and thus may have e, e, for planes on the obtuse and acute basal edges in the oblique prisms, (fig. 91), e, e, for planes on the obtuse and acute lateral edges. In the right rhomboidal prism the front superior basal edge is obtuse, e, the inferi or acute e, whde the lateral are rectangular, and are therefore lettered e, simply. (See fig. 88). In rectangular prisms, the longer basal edge may be marked e and the shorter e. In the obhque rhomboidal prisms, there are two unlike obtuse basal edges, and two unlike acute. We may letter planes on the edge to the right hand e', or e', on that to the left, 'e or 'e. If the front angles differ from the lateral, as in the rhombic and rhomboidal prisms, we may retain the Roman a for the front, and employ the italic a for the lateral, (fig. 72).' If the front angles at the two bases differ, as in the obhque prisms, the planes on the obtuse may be distinguished by a, those on the acute by a, (figs. 96, 97). In the rhombohedron, the vertical solid angle may be lettered' a, the lateral a \u25a0 the terminal edges e, the lateral e. All the monometric solids wdl be lettered, as if derived from the cube. In the other classes, the lettering will depend on the primary. The changes of the letter o for intermediaries, and the use of the marks and -~- wdl follow the same changes as the letter a : that is, intermediary planes about the angle a will be lettered 6, those about the angle a, o. The main principles in tins system of notation are : 1. Lettering planes on edges, e, on angles, a, and intermediaries, o. 2. Distinguishing planes on the basal edges from those on the lateral, when they are dissimdar, by lettering the former with a Roman e, and the latter with an italic e 3. Distinguishing planes on obtuse edges from those on acute, or longer basal edges from the shorter, by placing the mark \u2014 over the letter for the former, and for the latter as e, e, e, e. ' 4. Distinguishing planes on the frontal angles from those on the lateral, by lettering the former with a Roman a, the latter with an italic a. \u00b0 5. Distinguishing planes on obtuse frontal solid angles from those on acute bv the mark \u2014 over the letter for the former, and w for the latter. '"], [57, "41 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. III. LAW OF NUMERICAL PROPORTION, IN THE MODIFICATIONS OF CRYS TALS. 38. This second law gives a mathematical basis to the science, adding to symmetry of arrangement a numerical relation in the position of the planes. It is as follows : The position of planes is related in some simple ratio to the rela tive lengths of the axes of a crystal. For example. \u2014 In a cube the axes are equal. A plane on an edge, if extended to meet the axes, would cut these axes at some distance from the centre of the crystal. Now this distance for these axes will either be as 1 : 1 (e, fig. 5), that is a ratio of equal ity \u2014 a truncating plane ; or a ratio of 1 : 2 (like e, fig. 10 and fig. 42), 1:3, 2:3, or some other simple ratio. There is no haphazard scattering of facets, but a complete subserviency to this simple law. If the axes are unequal, as in a trimetric form, then the ratio is of the same character, except that the relative lengths of the axes come into the consideration. Thus if a, 6, are the axes, the ratios will be la : 16 (e, fig. 77, and a, fig. 82), or la : 26, la : 36, and so on. 39. Again, if there is a plane on an angle of a cube, it will meet, if extended, each of the three axes, and the ratio of the dis tances of the intersections from the centre will correspond to 1 : 1 : 1, (a, fig. 2, pi. 1), the distance being equal on each axis; also, 1:2:2, (a', fig. 14), 1:3:3, 2:1:1, (a\" fig. 19), and so on ; also, 1:4:2, (o, fig. 24, and o\", fig. 1, under pyrites), 2:3: 6, (o', fig. 1, under pyrites), and so on, for intermediary planes or such as are unequally inclined to the three axes. In a trimetric crystal, the ratios may be la : 16 : lc, (a, fig. 74, and e, fig. 75), la : 26 : 2c, 2a : 36 : 6c, and so on. 40. These numerical ratios are called the parameters of the planes. They afford an easy mode of designating the various planes of crystals. The planes, if extended, must meet one, two, or three axes : the faces of a cube intersect one axes and are paral lel to the other two ; planes on an edge intersect two axes and are parallel to the third ; while planes on the angles, if extended, intersect all the axes. All planes of crystals necessarily fall into one of these three divisions. When a plane is parallel to an axis it does not meet it short of an infinite distance, and hence the usual sign for infinity may rep resent this position. In this way, the plane P of a cube (fig. 1) may be distinguished by the significant symbol 1 : ac : <z>. The planes on an edge, by 1 : 1 : x> (e, figs. 5, 6, 9), 1 : 2 : oo, (e', figs. 10, 11, 12), 1 : 3 : qd, etc. ; the planes on an angle as already ex plained. More general expressions, including references to the lengths of the axes, are as follows : la : 006 : <xc, (M, fig. 50, M or M, fig. 69), 6"], [58, "42 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. la : 16 : \u0153c, (e, fig. 53, and fig. 80), oca : 16 : lc, (e, fig. 61, and figs. 70, 71), la : 26 : oac, la : 4b :2c; or, using m and n for any occur ring numbers, la : mb : nc. 41. Since in all cases one of the terms in the ratio may be a unit, it is only necessary to express the other two. 2a : ooc is as intelligible as 2a : 16 : \u0153c, and 4a : 2c as much so as Aa: lb :2c; and ma : nc as ma :1b: nc. 42. A still more convenient form of expression is that introduced by Naumann ;*' it is a modification of the above, and has the ad vantage of brevity. The terms of the ratio, as 4 : 2 in one of those last quoted, are placed with a letter of the alphabet (P, O, or R) between ; thus, 452 signifies the same as 4a : 2c, and mPn is a general expression for any plane, ma: lb : nc. According to this system of notation, \u0153Oao will be the symbol for a face of a cube, (1>, fig. 1) ; \u0153O the symbol for a plane truncating an edge of a cube, that is, for e, figs. 5, 6, and E, fig. 7, a rhombic dodecahedron ; oo 02, ac 03, etc. for beveling planes of a cube, as e', fig. 10, or the form in fig. 11 ; O, 20, 30, for planes on the angles of a cube, as a, fig. 2, and a\", fig. 19; 202, 303, equivalent to \\0 and $0 for other planes on the angles, as a', figs. 14, 15, 16 ; 402, 603 for other planes, like o', fig. 24. The letter O is used for the monometric system, of which the regular octahedron is the type, having the symbol O. For other systems P is used, excepting the rhombohedral, in which R is com monly employed. The symbols stand not for single planes only, but for the solid which such planes bound. O is the symbol for the octahedron ; oo O for the dodecahedron; 202 for the trapezohedron, fig. 16; od02 for the form in fig. 11 ; 402 for a form like fig. 25. 43. In trimetric forms the lateral axes are unequal. The po sitions of the planes with reference to the two are indicated by a long or short mark over the P. Thus, pec is the expression for a plane parallel to the longer axis, i^oo for one parallel to the shorter axis, and mpn, mpn, general terms for planes on the angles inclined towards one or the other of these axes, while mP is a general ex- pression for planes having the ratios la : 16 : lc, 2a: 16 : lc, 3a : 16 : lc, and so on ; that is, those which have a ratio of equal- ity between the lateral axes, or which incline equally (considering the relative lengths of the axes) towards the longer and shorter axes, oopoo and \u0153poo represent the lateral faces of a rectangular prism, oo P the face of the diagonal rhombic prism. For a basal plane, OP is used. 44. For hemihedral forms, a denominator 2 is placed under the several expressions. Thus, for the tetrahedron, (fig. 30), which is hemihedral to the octahedron, the expression is \u2014 ; and as there * Lehrbuch der reinen und angewandten Krystallographie, von Dr. Carl Friederich Naumann; in zwei Banden, 8\u00b0, mit 39 Kupfcrtafeln. Leipzig, 1830."], [59, "43 MODIFICATIONS OF CRYSTALS. may be two such hemihedrons in reverse situations, as figs. 30, 31, (one corresponding to a, fig. 28, and the other to a replacement of the angles not replaced in fig. 28), the two are distinguished by adding the sign + or \u2014 ; thus, + \u2014 and \u2014 \u2014 . Figs. 33 and 34 have the same relation as 14, 16, figure 34 being hemihedral to \u00b002 figure 16 ; and as the symbol of fig. 16 is 202, that of 34 is \"\u2014\u2014. So, fig. 40 is T-fr ; fig. 44, *-\u00b0\u00b0 , the bracket implying that the form is a parallel hemihedron. 45. The planes may be viewed in series, and a new interest per ceived in the relations thus exhibited. oopao is the plane parallel to the macrodiagonal of a trimetric form, mpcc represents other planes, (for example, 3pao, 2poo, pao, \\p<x> , $pao, &c.) parallel to the same diagonal or axis, which as m diminishes, more and more nearly approximate to the basal plane, and finally pass into it when ??i=0. Again, between ccpae. and OP, there is another similar series, all with parallel intersections, being parallel to the shorter axis. \u0153P, mP, OP, represent another series diagonal to the two just alluded to ; and <x>Pn, mPn, OP, other series. If n=2, we have a series <xP2, mP2, OP, which, substituting possible numbers for m, may become \u0153P2...AP2, P2, \\P2, iP2, IP2....0P, other series maybe ooP3....6_P3, 3-P3, P3, \\P3, iP3....0P ; in which again the mutual intersections of planes in the series will be par allel. From these explanations, this mode of viewing the planes in series is readily understood for other systems of crystallization. 46. In the monoclinic system, in which one of the axes is ob lique, the upper angles and edges in front differ from the lower in front, and they are distinguished by the signs + and \u2014 ; thus -4-mP and \u2014 mP, -\\-mPcc and \u2014 mPcc, are corresponding planes above and below the lateral axes. Moreover, the front lateral edge of an oblique rhombic prism differs from the side-lat eral, or in other words, the clinodiagonal differs from the orthodiag onal; planes parallel to the clinodiagonal are distinguished by placing an accent after the P, thus, aaP'ao , mP'\u0153 . 47. The relative dimensions ofthe axes of a crystal are readily ob tained, in many cases, by a simple trigonometrical calculation. If in a right square prism there is a plane on a terminal edge, as ab, (the figure being a sectional view), the angle Qab or Rba is ascertained by a goniometer. This gives, by subtraction from 180\u00b0, the angle Pab or Pba. Then the trigonometrical formula, rad : Pa (=1) : : tan Pab : Pb, affords the ratio of Pa to Pb, which is either the ratio of the height and breadth (la : lb) of the prism, or a related ratio, (la : 2b, la : 3b, etc.) as above explained. The probability of its being the actual"], [60, "44 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. ratio of a : b, may be inferred from the frequent occurrence of the plane, though there may still be some doubt ; yet this is of little consequence, since in a single ratio thus obtained we have a key to all the others throughout the crystal. 48. Knowing the axes, we may reverse the process and ascer tain the angles. If a plane, as ac, has the ratio 2a : 16, we have Pa { \u2014 I or 16) : rad : : Pc (=2a) : tan Pac. Then subtracting Pac from 180\u00b0, gives Qac, the desired inclination. In the cube, where a, 6, c, are all equal, the equation for a plane on an edge is simply, 1 : rad : : m : tan x. By this means, and the use of spherical trigonometry for the oblique forms, the mathematical calculations with regard to crystals were first made by the Abbe Haiiy. 49. The processes by analytical geometry have recently taken the place of the trigonometrical method, being recommended by their greater simplicity. The explanations already made show how the positions of any plane may be expressed by reference to its intersections with the three axes, given in position ; that is, the expression 1 : 2 : 2 for a plane on an angle of a cube, is an exact description of its posi tion ; and the expression 1:4:2 describes as exactly another plane. By the principles of analytical geometry a formula is de duced, by which, whatever the two planes, their mutual inclina tions are calculated at once from this data ; and conversely, the expression for the plane, the axes being known, is deduced from the angles. 50. In most crystals the edges of the planes will often be found to have several parallelisms in different directions. For example, the plane a, in a figure under Scapolite, makes parallel intersec tions between e and e ; and again e makes parallel intersections with a, o, e. Now as there can be but one plane e that will make such parallel intersections, if the expressions for the adjoining planes are known, that of e is at once deduced by means of a simple formula. The expression, in this case, for a is P ; for e is oo P ; and from this data we conclude, with certainty, that e is 2Pao. By such means, the eye of the experienced crystallogra pher reads off at a glance the exact character of a crystal. We follow these general explanations by a brief review of the modes of determining the expressions for planes of crystals, and for calculating their axes and angles of inclination."], [61, "45 CALCULATIONS OF CRYSTALS.

The three axes of a crystal may be considered as the intersec tions of three diametral planes, one horizontal and two vertical. Such planes divide the space about the centre into eight oc tants. In the above substitution the two planes are supposed to be in the same octant. If mPn is in an upper octant and m'Pn' in the one directly below, then ma is a distance measured above the horizontal plane, and m'a below it, and consequently one is +, the other \u2014 . So between other octants, it must be noted in employing the formula, that parameters on opposite sides of a diametral plane are respectively + and \u2014 in all instances : for the octants diagonally opposite, ma, 6, nc, would be all + in one, and all \u2014 in the other. 2. Equations for determining the Parameters of planes by their intersections. 53.

The form mPn completed is a double twelve-sided pyramid or berylloid, (fig. 126); mP and mP2 are double six-sided pyramids or quartzoids, (like fig 124 in form), the series mP2 inter mediate to the series mP : ooP and ooP2 are hexagonal prisms, respectively corresponding to the pyramids. ooPn, except when mP n=2, represents twelve-sided prisms. mR ( = \u2014 ) stands for rhom bohedrons, (Rj fig. 107, and other rhombohedrons of the same series) ; and \u2014 mR for an intermediate series, (e, figs. 119, 120, and a', figs. 121, 122). The form in figure 116 (a scalenohedron) is a hemihedral form in the hexagonal system, with the general sign \u00b1 -y- > and the planes e', fig. 117, and o, figure 118, if extended to the completion of a form, would produce other similar solids. Designated with reference to the axes of that rhombohedron from which they are derived, they come under the expression mRn, in which m equals the semi-axis of mR, and n is a coefficient, which multiplied into m will give the semi-axis ofthe form mR\". The ex pression \u2014 ~- is reduced to the form m'R\"' by making , m(2 \u2014 re) , , re m'=\u2014 -> and n\u2014- \u2014 \u00bb re 2 \u2014 n and conversely the latter is reduced to the former by making . , a 2re' m=m n , and n=^rr[- mR^ is the corresponding expression for the hexagonal prism (oth erwise oo P2) in the series mRn, or it is a scalenohedron with an infi nite axis. Planes like o, figure 7, under Quartz, have the sym bol 'ii-? or , (or^- ) > or \\ being used according as the planes are to the left or right above. 1.

The annexed figure repre sents the form \u00b1P, in the mono clinic system ; a, 6, c, are the axes. The inclination of a on 6 is oblique, and the angle is marked y ; b is the clinodiag onal, c the orthodiagonal.

Planes pertaining to the clinodiagonal (planes on the side angles and edges of the octahedron) are designated mP'n, mP'cc, aoP'ao ; the planes mP'oo are the same above and below the orthodiagonal.

The planes mP and \u00bb(Pn are expressed by using with Pthe accent ofthe face towards which the plane inclines; and their parallelism or inclina tion to the macrodiagonal or brachydiagonal is distinguished by the marks \u2014 or over the P ; as mtpn, rnppu. The replacement of the vertical angles by a plane parallel with the horizontal axial section, has the sign OP, as in other systems ; and the corresponding replacements of the basal angles, are oopao and aopoo .

If the plane in the basal section is considered the base, and the vertical solid angle of the octahedron the vertex, of one of these pyramids, its lateral interfacial angles are identical with the angles X, Y, A ; and since the terminal edges are X, F and the axis a, the plane angles at the summit are X : F, X : a, and Y : a, of which, the last two angles equal respectively (a and it. If we make the vertex A a centre, and describe with any given radius an arc on each of the faces, a spherical triangle is formed, whose an gles equal the inclinations of the faces of the pyramid, viz. X, F, A, and whose sides are measured by the plane angles at the vertex, two of which are and *. In this spherical triangle, if the angles A, ft and it are given, (that is, two sides, i* and *, and the included angle A), the angles X and F are readily determined by Napier's theorem. 1.

When the angles X and Fin any particular form are de sired, it will be necessary to obtain the values of (* and * for that form, and with these values and the angle A, the desired angle may be obtained by the above equations.

Hence, e=\u2014 P (\u00a7 101, 1, 6),anda=P'oo (\u00a7 101, 1,6); and also since M forms parallel intersections with e and e, is=ooP(\u00a7 101, l,a). a truncates the edge between e and e, which is the clinodiagonal edge of P, and therefore, a=Poo (\u00a7101,2). a in the same manner truncates the clinodiagonal edge of \u2014 P. Consequently, a=\u2014 Poo . (\u00a7 101, 2). The intersection of o' (mP'n) with e (P) is parallel to the clinodiagonal edge of P, consequently \u00ab=m (\u00a7 101, 5), and o'=mP'm.

Thence since the intersection of o' with e' is parallel to the basal section of o', (mP'm), o'=2P'2 (\u00a7 101, 1, a) as before found.

This property of mica depends on its crystallization, and the process of separation is termed cleavage. Galena is another instance of a mineral capa ble of easy cleavage. It differs from mica, however, in having three cleavage directions at right angles with one another. This mineral, therefore, instead of splitting into thin plates, breaks into small cubes. Calcareous spar also admits of easy cleavage, but yields rhombohedrons. The directions in which a crystal may be cleaved, are termed natural joints, and the slices obtained, are called lamin\u00e6. The facility with which cleavage may be obtained, is very une qual in different minerals. In some instances, as in the first above cited, the lamin\u00e6 are separable by the fingers. In others, a slight blow of the hammer is sufficient ; others require the application of a sharp-cutting instrument, and often some considerable skill in its use. When other means fail, it may sometimes be effected by heating the mineral and plunging it, when hot, into cold water. Attempts of this kind are sometimes effectual with quartz. In many instances, cleavage cannot be effected by any means, owing to the strong cohesion of the lamin\u00e6. In these cases, however, the direction of cleavage is sometimes indicated by lines on the sur face. It is often important to observe these lines when cleavage is possible, in order to determine its direction before applying the knife. When cleavage is easily obtained, it is said to be eminent. 114. The general laws, with respect to cleavage, are as follows: 1. Cleavage in crystals of the same species yields the same form and angles. 2. Cleavage takes place parallel either to one or more of the faces of a fundamental form, or to its diagonals, or to some sec ondary planes. 3. Cleavage is obtained with equal ease or difficulty parallel to similar faces, and with unequal ease or difficulty parallel to dis similar faces. 4. Cleavage parallel to similar planes, affords planes of similar lustre and appearance, and the converse. Cleavage may take place as follows : \u2014 a. Parallel to all the faces of a fundamental form, and alike in each direction. 6. Parallel to but two faces of a fundamental form, and alike in each direction. c. Parallel to but one face of a fundamental form. d. Parallel to two or three faces, and unlike in the three direc tions. e. Parallel to vertical diagonal planes ; and if these planes are unequal, parallel either to the longer or shorter diagonal, (macrodi agonal or brachydiagonal)."], [89, "CLEAVAGE. 73 /. Parallel to a diagonal plane oblique between opposite solid angles, in one or more directions. g. Parallel to other secondary planes. 115. According to the law above stated, cleavage is obtained with equal ease or difficulty parallel to all the faces of a cube, octa hedron, dodecahedron, or rhombohedron, which solids are contained under equal planes. The right square prism, right rhombic prism, and oblique rhombic prism, may be cleaved with equal ease or dif ficulty, parallel to their lateral planes, since these are similar. Of ten, however, no cleavage can be effected in these prisms, except parallel to the bases, and, in many instances, not even in this direc tion. Frequently the cleavage is diagonal ; in the square prism, it will be alike in both vertical diagonal planes, but in the rhombic prisms it will be unlike, since these planes are not equal. The right rectangular, right rhomboidal, and oblique rhomboidal prisms, have the cleavage unequal parallel to their faces, if attain able at all in these directions ; and according to the third law, the cleavage in the three directions will produce faces of unlike lustre and general appearance. This is exemplified in gypsum : in one direction, it is cleavable with great facility into thin lamin\u00e6 of perfect transparency, and highly polished surfaces ; in a second direction the crystalline lamin\u00e6 first bend and then break, exhibit ing a surface which is not smooth, nor possessed of much lustre ; in a third direction, it is brittle, and breaks immediately on at tempting to bend it, affording a surface smoother than the second, but not polished. In thick masses, the second and third cleavages are scarcely attainable. Two of these cleavages incline at an ob lique angle, but are at right angles with the third. 1 16. Cleavage is said to be basal when in a form it is parallel to the base, (OP) ; and lateral, when parallel to the lateral planes. Prismatic, when parallel to the lateral planes ooP, (M of a rhom bic prism). Diagonal, in a rhombic prism, when vertical and parallel to the planes ooPoo . In the trimetric system, macrodiagonat, if parallel to the longer diagonal ; brachydiagonal, if parallel to the shorter diagonal. In the monoclinic system, clinodiagonal, if parallel to the inclined lateral axis ; orthodiagonal, if parallel to the other lateral axis. In some cases, rhombohedrons have a cleavage parallel to a plane truncating the vertical angle ; cleavage is then described as basal, it being parallel to the base of the related hexagonal prism. When the cleavage is parallel to the faces of a rhombohedron, it is styled rhombohedral. Other cleavages are described by mentioning the particular plane with which they correspond in direction. 117. M. A. Baudrimont has recently observed that the three pri mary rhombohedral cleavages of calc spar are not always absolutely equal, and, moreover, that there are other cleavages not before recog nized. His observations seem to show, that while the fact that the vertical axis is normally an axis of symmetry, as demonstrated by 10"], [90, "CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 74 the crystallization, and by optical, thermoticand acoustic investiga tions, still extrinsic circumstances cause some variations from per fect symmetry in the cleavage, and also correspondingly m the lus tre and transparency. The cleavages observed by him are as fol- lows : \u2014 1. Parallel to the faces ofthe primary rhombohedron. 2. Parallel to the longer diagonal of the primary faces. 3. Parallel to the shorter diagonal of the primary faces. 4. Parallel to different secondary planes. I. Ot the first kind the cleavage may be, a. Equal in three directions, (normal). \u2014 Rare. Iceland spar. 6. Equal in two directions. Less rare. c. Unequal in three directions. Common. II. Of the second kind, the cleavage may be, a. In a single direction. Quite common. 6. In two directions unequal. More rare. c. In three directions. Very rare. III. Of the third kind, a. In one direction. Very rare. The cleavage parallel to the longer diagonal has long been noticed. 118. The varieties of cleavage in connection with the actual forms of crystallization lead to the conclusion that there are at least thirteen fundamental forms among crystals, as stated on page 25. The three forms, the cube, the regular octahedron, and the dodeca hedron, belong to one system, the monometric. But in some cases the cleavage is cubic, in others octahedral, and in others dodecahe dral. Hence it is naturally inferred that each may properly be con sidered a fundamental form. So there are dimetric crystals with cleavage that affords a square prism, and others with cleavage that yields a square octahedron. The same reasoning applies to all the forftis mentioned on pages 23,24 These, therefore are justly styled the fundamental forms in crystallography ; for cleavage is the pro per basis of evidence on this point. In most cases, the mineralogist needs seek to ascertain only the system of crystallization, which is of more certain knowledge. IV. IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. 119. The laws of crystallization, when unmodified by external causes, produce forms of exact symmetry ; the angles are not only equal, but also the polygonal faces of crystals and their several di mensions. This symmetric harmony is however so uncommon,"], [91, "IRREGULARITIES OP CRYSTALS. 75 that it can hardly be considered other than an ideal perfection. Crystals are very generally distorted, and often the fundamental forms are so completely disguised, that an intimate familiarity with the possible irregularities is required, in order to unravel their com plexities. The irregularities of crystals may be treated of under four heads:* 1. Imperfections of surface ; 2. Variations of form and dimensions ; 3. Internal imperfections and impurities ; 4. Vari ations of angles. I. IMPERFECTIONS IN THE SURFACES OF CRYSTALS. 1. Striated Surfaces. 120. The parallel furrows on the surfaces of crystals are called stri\u0153, and such surfaces are said to be striated. Each little ridge on a striated surface is enclosed by two narrow planes more or less regular. These planes often correspond in po sition to the secondary or primary planes of the crystal, and we may suppose these ridges to have been formed by a continued oscil lation in the operation of the causes that give rise, when acting un interruptedly, to enlarged planes By this means, the surfaces of a crystal are marked in parallel lines, with a succession of narrow planes' meeting at an angle and constituting the ridges referred to. This combination of different planes in the formation of a surface has been termed the oscillatory combination. The horizontal stri\u00e6 on prismatic crystals of quartz, (fig. 25, p. 80), are examples of this combination, in which the oscillation has taken place between the prismatic and pyramidal planes. As the crystals lengthened, there was apparently a continual effort to assume the terminal pyramidal planes, which effort was interruptedly overcome by a strong tenden cy to an increase in the length ofthe prism. In this manner, crys tals of quartz are often tapered to a point, without the usual pyra midal terminations. Cubes of pyrites are generally striated in 4 such a way that the stri\u00e6 on adjacent faces are at right angles with one another, as in the accompanying figure. These lines are par allel to the intersections of the primary sur faces with the planes of a pentagonal dode cahedron, (fig. 43 and 44, pi. 1), the most common secondary of pyrites ; and they have evidently resulted from an oscillation be tween the primary and this secondary. Diagonal stri\u00e6 sometimes occur on the iron pyrites. faces of a cube showing an oscillatory combination between the * Many of the following facts, with the general arrangement of them, are extracted from Naumann's work on Crystallography."], [92, "76 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY cube and octahedron. The rhombic dodecahedron is often striated parallel either with the longer or the shorter diagonal of its faces ; the former resulting from an oscillatory combination of the dode cahedron with the regular octahedron, and the latter with the cube or planes bevelling the edges of the cube, as in Aplome. The accompanying figure represents a distorted crystal of magnetic iron from Had dam, Ct., illustrating the oscillation between the octahedron and dodecahedron. The faces of trapezohedral garnets are often striated parallel with the symmetrical diagonal, showing an os cillation with the dodecahedron. Rhombohedrons of chabazite and red silver ore are often striated parallel to the terminal edges, indicating an oscillatory combination Magnetic iron. between the primary faces and a secondary plane replacing these edges. Prisms of tourmaline are very commonly bounded by three con vex surfaces, owing to an oscillatory combination of the planes a and e, (figures 2 and 3 under Tourmaline). 121. It is obvious that the irregularities described must some times affect the angle of inclination between planes. The interfa cial angles of a rhombic prism are thus made more obtuse, being sometimes increased 15 or 20 degrees, and occasionally, as just stated, the angles are lost in a curved surface. This seldom leads to important error, since the striations generally show that the faces are not simple planes. Tremolite, Tourmaline, &c, are examples. 122. The striations on the lateral surfaces of foliated minerals like mica and gypsum, are merely the edges of lamin\u00e6. The interposition of foreign substances in parallel lines also pro duce striations. Brewster attributes to this source the parallel diag onal lines in some rhombohedral crystals of calc spar. Besides striations, the surfaces of crystals are sometimes formed of minute crystals ; such are the faces of octahedral crystals of fluor, consisting of minute cubes. Angular markings are^also often observed, as on quartz crystals, beryls, &c, indicating the internal structure of the crystal. 2. Cavernous Crystals. 123. Crystals not unfrequently occur with a deep pyramidal depression occupying the place of each plane, as is often observed in common salt, alum and sul phur. The annexed figure represents a cavern ous cube of salt. In the solution of crystals, the same form is sometimes obtained, owing to the fact that the centres of the faces yield sooner than the edges and angles. A remarkable cav ernous crystal of pyrites, from Almerode, is de scribed by Hausmann. It is an enlonged cube with its upper edges replaced by faces of the Common Salt."], [93, "77 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. dodecahedron ; but instead of a corresponding replacement of the lateral edges, a deep rectangular channel occupies the place of each. It resembles a cruciform crystal of Harmotome ; but the striations show that is not compound. 3. Curved Surfaces. 124. Curved surfaces resulting from what is termed oscillatory combination, have already been noticed. Other curvatures pro ceed from a curvature in the lamin\u00e6 constituting the crystal. Crystals of diamond have convex faces, and they are sometimes almost spheres. (See fig. 20, page 79, and fig. 1, under Diamond). This mode of curvature in which all the faces are equally convex, is less common than that in which a convex surface is opposite and parallel to a corresponding concave surface. Rhombohedrons of spathic iron and pearl spar are usually thus curved, as is shown in figure 2 of spathic iron. The saddle shaped crystals of the same mineral (fig. 1) are remarkable instances of several curvatures in the same face. A singular curvature is shown in the accompany- 7 ing figure of white iron pyrites. The conical crystals of brown zinc blende and the lenticular and conical crystals of gypsum, are other examples. Crystals of quartz are sometimes curved and twisted. When this takes place in the left-handed and right-handed crystals, the twist is to the right or left, according as the crystal is right or left-handed.* The surfaces of crystals are sometimes rounded, in consequence of having been partially fused, or dissolved. The globular quartz of St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., is sup posed by Prof. Emmons to have been thus rounded. II. VARIATIONS IN THE FORMS AND DIMENSIONS OF CRYSTALS. 125. The simplest modification of form in crystals, consists in a simple variation in length or breadth, without a disparity in similar secondary planes. The distortion, however, extends very generally to the secondary planes, especially when the elongation of a crystal takes place in the direction of a diagonal, instead of the crystal lographic axes. In many instances, one or more secondary planes are obliterated by the enlargement of others, proving a source of much perplexity to the young student. The interfacial angles re main constant, unaffected by these variations in form. As most of the difficulties in the study of crystals arises from these distortions, this subject is one of great importance to the student. 126. Monometric System. \u2014 A cube (figure 1, plate 1) lengthened or shortened along one axis, becomes a right square prism, (figure * Figure 6, under quartz, is a left-handed crystal, as is apparent from the relative situ ation of the planes o and a."], [94, "78 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 50, plate 1) ; and if varied in the direction of two axes is changed to a rectangular prism, (figure 69, plate 2). Cubes of pyrites, ga lena, fluor spar, &c, are generally thus distorted. It is very unu sual to find a cubic crystal that is a true symmetrical cube. An octahedron flattened parallel to a face is reduced to a tabular crystal, (fig. 8). If lengthened in the same direction, it takes the form in figure 9 ; or if still further lengthened to the obliteration of A', it becomes an acute rhombohedron, (same figure). 8 9 10 When an octahedron is extended in the direction of a line be tween two opposite edges, it has the general form of a rectangular octahedron ; and still further extended, as in figure 10, it is changed to a rhombic prism with dihedral summits. The figure represents this prism lying on its acute edge, (spinel, fluor, magnetic iron). 13 11 The dodecahedron lengthened along a diagonal between the obtuse solid angles, becomes a six-sided prism with three-sided summits, as in figure 11 ; and shortened in the same direc- 14 tion, is a short prism of the same kind, (fig. 13). Both resemble secondaries to a rhombohe dron, and are common in garnet and zinc blende. When lengthened in the direction of one of the crystallographic axes, it becomes a square prism with pyramidal summits, (fig. 12), and shortened along the same axis it is reduced to a square octahedron with truncated basal angles, (figure 14). The trapezohedron is still more disguised by its distortions. When elongated in the line of an octahedral axis it assumes the form in figure 15, and still farther lengthened, to the obliteration of some ofthe planes, becomes a scalene dodecahedron, (fig. 16). This"], [95, "79 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. has been observed in fluor spar. If the elongation takes place along a crystallographic axis, it changes to a double eight-sided pyr- 15 \" 18 16 amid with four-sided summits, (fig. 17) ; or if these summit planes are obliterated by a farther extension, it becomes a complete eight sided double pyramid, (figure 18). Still more complex forms are of occasional occurrence among monometric crystals, especially when modified by secondary planes. Figure 19 represents a garnet from Monzoniberg ; it is a combina- ly 20 21 Garnet. Diamond. Galena. tion of the dodecahedron and trapezohedron ; but the crystal is so altered by distortion, that only four dodecahedral faces (e) remain and sixteen of the trapezohedral, (a') ; and the latter are of very une qual size. Figure 20 is a distorted form of diamond. It is short ened in the direction of a diagonal, so that only two octahedral planes (a) remain, and 12 out of 48 planes o' \u2014 the six around each a, (see fig. 25, plate 1). Figure 21 represents a crystal of Galena from Rossie. It is a shortened cube ; the lateral faces are very irregularly curved, and consist of the primary faces of the cube and the planes truncating the lateral edges. Some of the terminal edges are also truncated. The crystal is surmounted by a low pyr amid, consisting of four planes on each of the angles and edges, which, owing to the distortion, do not occur elsewhere on the crys tal. The cleavages of the crystal easily explain the relations of the several planes to the primary. 127. The annexed figure of calcite (fig. 22) represents a scalene"], [96, "80 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. dodecahedron, with its apices replaced by planes of the primary rhombohedron 22 23 Calcite. Calcite. A distorted form of the same from Rossie is shown in figure 23, which appears, however, to be an eight-sided prism, bounded late rally by the planes R, e', e', and R, and their opposites, and termi nated by the remaining planes of figure 22. The annexed figures of quartz, (fig. 24 and 25,) represent distorted forms of this mineral, in which some of the pyramidal faces by enlargement, displace the prismatic faces, and nearly obliterate some of the other pyramidal faces. 24 i_5 Quartz. Quartz. Figure 4 and 5 under Quartz are other crystals less distorted. The inclination of R on a or a\" is the same in all the various dis- torted forms ; and by measuring the angles, and also by observing the similar surfaces of like planes, the homologous parts may be distinguished, however much disguised. The angle a on a around the prism is 120\u00b0 ; and consequently if an angle of this size is made out, the edge corresponding may be set down as one of the lateral edges of the prism. Thus with the goniometer, and the principle that like planes are like in surface, and noting also the"], [97, "81 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. cleavage, if any exists, we may develop the whole character of a crystal, however much disguised. Figure 26 of apatite is the same form that is represented in figure 27, but greatly distorted. The planes e' e, e\", between P and the right M, are enlarged, while the corresponding planes below are in part obliterated. By observing that similar planes are lettered 26 27 28 Apatite. Apatite. Beryl. alike, the two figures may be compared throughout. Figure 28 represents a hexagonal prism of beryl distorted so as to resemble a rhombic prism, with the acute lateral edges truncated, two oppo site planes M being nearly obliterated by the extension of the other four. Curved Crystals. 128. Curves in imbedded crystals are of frequent occurrence ; and in implanted crystals they are not very uncommon. The an nexed figure of quartz (fig. 29) illustrates this kind of distortion '. 20 so Quartz. Beryl, Monroe, Ct. the same is described by Beck as occurring in the apatite of St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. Six-sided prisms of calcite are occasion ally curved in the same manner. In many species, the crystals appear as if they had been broken transversely into many pieces, a slight displacement of which has given a curved form to the prism. This is common in tourmaline and beryl. The beryls of Monroe, Conn., often present these interrupted curvatures, as represented in figure 30. 129. Very singular curvatures are described by Herschel, (Phil. Mag. 1833, ii, 110), as occurring in crystalline plates of ice ad hering to stems of plants. These plates were implanted longi- 11"], [98, "82 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY tudinally on opposite sides of the stem, and curved so far around as nearly to en circle it. They had a fibrous look, like some varieties of gypsum. The author has observed similar crystalliza tions in the vicinity of New Haven. The plates were at tached to a single side ofthe stem, and curving around, almost enclosed it like a cylinder. An instance of the same on a stone wall has been observed by Prof. Rigaud. The plates of ice were attached to the edges of the stones and curved away from the mortar. They were found only on a part of the wall recent ly built. Prof. Locke of Cincinnati, has described (American Jour, of Science, xiii, 206) similar crystalliza- 31 Gypsum, Mammoth Cave. tions of alabaster (gypsum) from the mammoth cave of Kentucky. \" Alabaster rosettes\" occur there afoot in diameter, consisting of a disk surrounded by circles of leaves rolled elegantly outward ; and tortuous vines with tendrils, and curled leaves, are beautifully im itated. III. INTERNAL IMPERFECTIONS AND IMPURITIES. 130. The transparency of crystals is often destroyed by dis turbed crystallization, or by impurities taken up from the solution during the process of crystallization. Oxyd of iron, chlorite, pyrites, silica, and alumina, are among the most common of these impuri ties. Any mineral, indeed, that may be dissolved or mechanically suspended in the menstruum with the crystallizing mineral, may be thus entangled and forced into the constitution of crystals. The impurities often take a symmetrical arrangement. In gen eral, foreign matter collects most abundantly about the centre and along the diagonals, and also in planes between the centre and edges of the crystal. The latter taking place in the cube, produces an arrangement similar in form to the cavernous cubes above de scribed."], [99, "IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. 83 In chiastolite, the foreign matter is arranged about the central axis, and in planes running from this axis to the edges, and also about the lateral edges and exterior surface of the crystal, (see fig ures under Andalusite). Dr. Jackson has observed the same in staurotide. Tremolite has also been observed, according to Nau mann, with an interior tesselated structure, like chiastolite. It had crystallized in contact with pulverulent carbonate of lime and mag nesia. Fluor spar, common salt, and numerous other species, some times present similar appearances. The zircons of St. Lawrence County, New York, often have a tesselated structure. Some crys tals are grayish-white with the exception of the angles, which are bright chestnut-brown, either of a uniform color, or in parallel stripes about the plane o', (see fig. under Zircon). In one crystal from this region, Professor Beck found a nucleus of carbonate of lime, and it is probable, as he suggests, that the white coloring mat ter thus symmetrically arranged, is carbonate of lime. In many instances, the foreign matter lies in layers parallel with some of the exterior planes. This is often noticed in crystals of quartz, in which there are layers of different colors parallel with the faces of the terminal pyramids. In this way transparent crys tals sometimes have an exterior coating of an opaque white color. Tabular crystals of heavy spar are often banded parallel with the lateral faces. The mica from Jones's creek near Baltimore, contains opaque lines or bands in concentric hexagonal figures, which arise from the same cause. In one specimen the meeting of two hexag onal figures indicated a compound structure, or twin crystalliza tion, a fact not apparent from any peculiarity on the surface of the mica. A mica from New Hampshire has similar markings, and in one transparent specimen in the cabinet of Dr. Jackson of Boston, there are broad bands of a deep black color meeting at angles of 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 the angles of the crystal. 131. Among the most remarkable impurities are the drops of liquids that occur in many crystals. In some cases they appear to be simply water or a solution of the mineral itself, and when ex posed by fracture, crystallization takes place on evaporation. In other instances, they are resinous fluids of different kinds, as first detected by Sir David Brewster in topaz, quartz, and other minerals. The same author has discovered in topaz innumerable micro scopic crystals arranged more or less in extensive layers, though sometimes in concentric arches or radiations, among which were many different forms, as the tetrahedron, the cube and its seconda ries, rhombohedron, hexagonal plates, prism with plane and pyra midal summits, flat octahedron more or less modified, rectangular plates. Some of the tesseral crystals melt easily and others not at all ; aftd of the rest, some are of easy fusibility, others of diffi cult, and others infusible : so that at least five different substan-"], [100, "84 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. ces were indicated.* A microscopic examination of iridescent feldspar has brought to light that in some cases it contains minute crystals of specular iron disseminated through it, to which the peculiar iridescence is owing, IV. VARIATIONS IN THE ANGLES OF CRYSTALS. 132. The greater part of the distortions described, leave unal tered the interfacial angles of crystals. But those imperfections that produce convex, curving or striated faces, necessarily cause vari ations, as explained on pp. 76, 77. The surfaces of larger crystals often have a composite character, as a magnifying glass will show, if not visible to the naked eye ; they appear as if there had been a tendency to the formation of smaller crystals while the crystal was enlarging. The polygonal markings on quartz crystals are of this character. Octahedrons of fluor sometimes have the faces made up of little cubes. Such a cause produces more or less irregularity in the planes and their inclinations. Sometimes while enlargement is in progress and far advanced, portions of a crystal become more or less independent in their crystallization, and thus quite large variations from symmetry result, exhibited either in the unnatural protuberance or breadth of certain parts, or a subdivision into distinct crystals. 133. Besides imperfections from these sources, there are others derived from the presence of impurities, entangled in the crystal lizing mineral. Such impurities, although in many instances sym metrically arranged, still influence unfavorably the form of the crystal ; the foreign particles are guided in an imperfect degree by the forces of the crystallizing molecules, and have not the powers of arrangement in themselves which can carry each to its place ; and hence impure crystals, as macles, commonly differ much in their angles. When these foreign ingredients are not thus symmetric ally arranged, their injurious effect on the form is even more stri king ; and there are few cases of crystals of large size, in which such impurities do not exist. According to the measurements of calc spar by A. Baudri mont, the rhombs of this mineral seldom have the three angles at summit perfectly identical. 134. The variations of angle just alluded to, are of no constant character, and are therefore imperfections. A cube under some cir cumstances may have the angle of a rhombic prism ; but the iden tity of the similar faces, and the tesseral character in the modifi cations of the crystal, will still be apparent; the six bounding * * See further on this subject, Trans. Eoy. Soc. of Edinburg, for 1823 and 1826 ; and Trans. Roy. Soc. London, 1847, xvi, 11 ; also Amer. Jour. Science, xii, 214, 1827 and s2l v, 420, 1848."], [101, "85 DETERMINATION OF CRYSTALS. planes will be alike in lustre, cleavage, hardness, and stri\u00e6, however much the angles may vary, and this is never the case with any but equilateral solids. The distribution of modifying planes will prove in like manner the perfect similarity of the edges and angles. So in a form resembling a rhombohedron, if the angles at the lateral edges differed fundamentally from one another, the edges would be unlike, and the modifications would be monoclinic, (or those of an oblique rhombic prism), instead of rhombohedral. Thus by means of the modifications and physical characters, as already illustrated, we may distinguish without difficulty between accidental varia tions and those of a fundamental character. The angles of crystals are varied also by temperature. But this kind of variation depends on the nature of matter or its relation to heat, and is not properly noticed in this place. V. DETERMINATION AND MEASUREMENTS OF CRYSTALS. 135. Owing to the irregular variations of form in crystals, it is evident that the shape alone will seldom be sufficient to determine the system of crystallization. The indications giving important aid, may be briefly reviewed. 136. a. Cleavage. \u2014 Cleavage being alike parallel to like faces, and unlike parallel to unlike faces, if a cube affords three equal rec tangular cleavages, (equal in ease and alike in lustre), the form must be monometric ; if two equal rectangular cleavages, it is dimetric ; if three unequal, it is trimetric. Again, if the angle between the cleavage planes is oblique, this gives farther evidence as to the system, as the principles already explained sufficiently elucidate. 137. 6. Lustre, Hardness, Color, Character of Surfaces. \u2014 Like planes are like in lustre, hardness, stri\u00e6, whatever may be the vari ations in size. Hence, if a cube has like stri\u00e6 on all its six sides, the form is plainly monometric ; but if the surface of one of its opposite sides differs from that of the others, the form belongs to some other system. So hardness and color often differ, and lustre almost uniformly, for unlike planes. (See beyond, under Color). 138. c. Refraction, Polarization. \u2014 As explained on a following page, the system of crystallization has generally a direct relation to the polarizing properties of the crystal. When we have but frag ments of a mineral, this mode is highly important ; and it is espe cially useful for the species of mica, whose external form is seldom well developed. Micas of the same form \u2014 a hexagonal prism \u2014 have thus been shown to belong to distinct systems, the hexagonal and trimetric. 139. d. Heat, Elasticity. \u2014 The properties of crystals as regards"], [102, "86 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. the conduction of heat, and their elasticity, have a direct depend ence on their crystalline form ; but the means of making observa tions on these points are not yet easily obtained, and require much skill in their application. 140. e. Character of the modifications of crystals. \u2014 The position of planes upon crystals is an unerring guide to the system of crys tallization, when the crystal is much modified, (except in some of the grosser distortions,), and may serve to correct deductions from measurements. If a cube is found to have slightly oblique angles on measurement, and still the edges are all modified alike, and the angles also alike, there is good evidence that the crystal is monometric, for only like parts of a crystal are alike in their modi fications. If the crystal were rhombohedral, as the apparently oblique angle might be thought to imply, there would be two kinds of edges to the rhombohedron, and two kinds of solid angles, to be modified differently. If a cubical crystal has different planes in number or inclination on a set of lateral edges from what it has on the basal, the form must be dimetric. The same principle is easily applied to other cases. \u2014 In such examinations, the characters men tioned in the following table should be noted : \u2014 1. All edges modified alike. ) ,, 2.

The following are important laws for determining dissimilarity of planes, and their application will often prove a similarity where, from the great dissimilarity in the size of the planes, it was not sup posed to exist. 1. Planes equally inclined to the same plane, are similar. 2. Planes equally inclined to similar planes, are similar. 141. f. Measurements of angles. \u2014 The importance of this means of ascertaining the system of crystallization is obvious. As has been implied, (see pp. 76, 84), it may lead to erroneous deductions ; but in most cases it enables us to correct conclusions drawn from other sources. It generally gives essential aid in carrying out the mode of discrimination last laid down. USE OF GONIOMETERS. 142. The angles of crystals are measured by means of instru ments called Goniometers. 143. a. Common Goniometer, called also, Hauy's Goniometer. \u2014 The simplest of these instruments, called the Common Goniometer, is here represented. It consists, 1, of a semicircular arc graduated to degrees, and, consequently, measuring 180\u00b0; 2, two arms, one of which, a6, is stationary, or admits only of a sliding motion back- 32 ward and forward, by means of the slits, gh, ik. The other arm turns on o, the centre of the arc, as an axis ; there is also a slit, np, in this arm. By means of these slits, the parts of the arms below o, that is, ao, co, may be shortened, which is found necessary for the measurement of small crystals. The faces, whose inclination is to be measured, are applied between the arms ao, co, which are opened till they just admit the crystal, and are seen to be closely applied to the surfaces of the same. This should be determined by close examination, holding it at the same time up to the light and observ-"], [104, "88 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. ing that no light passes between the arm and the plane of the crys tal. The number of degrees on the arc, between k and the left edge of d, (this edge being in the line of the centre o of the arc), is the required angle. For measuring crystals partially imbedded, the arc is usually jointed at/, so that the part, as, may be folded back on the other quadrant.\" When the angle has been measured, the arms are secured in their place by the screw at o, and the arc restored to its former position, and there fastened by the bar, mo. The angle may now be read off. The arms sometimes admit of being separated from the arc, in order to obtain more conveniently the required angle. They may then be adjusted to the arc in a very simple manner, which will be understood by the observer without expla nation, and the angle read off as above. When a goniometer is not at hand, approximate results may be obtained by means of an extemporaneous pair of arms, made carefully of mica, or even of Bristol board. After taking the angles with them in the manner explained, place them on a sheet of paper, and with a pencil and ruler lay off the angle by drawing lines parallel with, or in the direction of, each arm of the forceps. This angle may then be measured by means of a graduated arc, or a scale of chords or tangents, either of which is usually to be found in a box of mathematical instruments, or may be obtained separately at the shops : or it may be measured by applying the arms directly to the graduated arc. The results obtained with a common goniometer are seldom within a quarter of a degree of truth. It is, however, sufficiently accurate for common use. For polished crystals, we have a much superior instrument in the Reflective Goniometer of Wollaston. 144. b. The Reflective Goniometer of Wollaston. \u2014 The reflec tive goniometer is represented in the annexed figure. The princi ple on which this instrument is constructed may be understood by reference to the following figure, which represents a crystal, whose angle, abc, is required. The eye at P, looking at the face of the crystal, 33 be, observes a reflected image of m, in the direc tion of P71. The crystal may now be so changed in its position, that the same image is seen reflected by the next face, and in the same direction, Pn. To effect this, the crystal must be turned around, until abd has the present direction of be. The angle dbc, measures, therefore, the number of degrees through which the crystal must be turned. But dbc, subtracted from 180\u00b0, equals the required angle of the crystal, abc. The crystal is, therefore, passed in its revolu tion through a number of degrees, which subtracted from 180\u00b0 give the required angle. This angle evidently might be measured by attaching the crystal to a graduated circle, which should turn with the crystal."], [105, "89 MEASUREMENT OF CRYSTALS. This object is conveniently accomplished by the ingenious and simple contrivance of Wollaston. AB is the circle, gradua ted to half degrees. By means of the vernier, v, minutes are measured. The wheel m is attached to the main axis, and moves the graduated circle, together with the adjusted crystal. The wheel n is connected with an axis that passes through the main axis, (which is hollow for the purpose), and moves merely the parts to which the crys tal is attached, in order to aid in its adjustment. The contrivances for the adjust ment of the crystal are at 34 p, q, r. To use the instrument, it must be placed on a small stand or table, and so elevated as to allow the observer to rest his elbows on the table. The whole, thus firmly arranged, is to be placed in front of a window, distant from the same from six to twelve feet, with the axis of the instrument parallel to it. Before operation, a dark line should be drawn below the window near the floor, parallel to the bars of the window ; or, what is still better, on a slate or board, placed before the observer on the table. The crystal is attached to the moveable plate q, by a piece of wax, and so arranged, that the edge of intersection of the two planes including the required angle, shall be in a line with the axis of the instrument. This is done by varying its situation on the plate q, or the situation of the plate itself, or by means of the adja cent joints and wheel, r, s, p. When apparently adjusted, the eye should be brought close to the crystal, nearly in contact with it, and on looking into a face, part of the window will be seen reflected, one bar of which must be selected for the experiment. If the crystal is correctly adjusted, the selected bar will appear horizontal, and on turning the wheel, n, till this bar, reflected, is observed to approach the dark line below, seen in a direct view, it will be found to be parallel to this dark line, and ultimately to coincide with it. If there is not a perfect coinci dence, the adjustment must be altered until this coincidence is obtained. Continue then the revolution of the wheel, n, till the same bar is seen by reflection in the next face, and if here there is also a coincidence of the reflected bar with the dark line seen direct, the adjustment is complete ; if not, alterations must be 12"], [106, "90 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. made, and the first face again tried. A few successive trials ofthe two faces, will enable the observer to obtain a perfect adjustment. After adjustment, 180\u00b0 on the arc should be brought opposite 0 on the vernier. The coincidence of the bar and dark line is then to be obtained, by turning the wheel n. As soon as obtained, the wheel m should be turned until the same coincidence is observed, by means of the next face of the crystal. If a line on the gradu ated circle now corresponds with 0 on the vernier, the angle is im mediately determined by the number of degrees marked by this line. If no line corresponds with 0, we must observe which line on the vernier coincides with a line on the circle. If it is the 18th on the vernier and the line on the circle, next below 0 on the ver nier, marks 125\u00b0, the required angle is 125\u00b0 18'; if this line marks 125\u00b0 30', the required angle is 125\u00b0 48'. Some goniometers are furnished with a small polished reflector attached to the foot of the instrument, below the part s q, and placed at an oblique angle so as to reflect a bar of the window. This is an important improvement, as the reflected bar answers the purpose ofthe line drawn below the window, and is more conven iently used. This reflector may be easily added to the common instruments, placing it at an angle of about 45\u00b0, or such as will reflect the bar to the eye when looking towards the crystal while observing. 145. Mitscherlich's Goniometer has a small lens mounted in a tube for sighting the crystal ; but the lens diminishes so much the light reflected by the crystal to the eye, that it is not of much value. This instrument is furnished also with a micrometer screw for aid in turning the graduated circle, and certain valuable con trivances for adjusting the crystal. Mohs's Goniometer differs from Wollaston's mainly in having the circle horizontal. 146. Babinet's Goniometer has a horizontal graduated circle. The crystal is placed at centre on the axis, with the edge vertical. There are two glasses mounted horizontally, with tubes and cross threads, for sighting the crystal : both are attached to the gradua ted arc, one moveable, the other fixed. The crystal is so placed that one face, (ofthe two including the required angle), on being viewed through the moveable glass reflects the sight-threads of the other glass : it is then turned around till the other face gives the same reflection. The arc through which the crystal is revolved, is then read off on the graduated circle. 147. Adelman's Goniometer is an ingenious contrivance, made at Paris, combining a common and a reflecting Goniometer. It is much less costly than Wollaston's. 148. In goniometrical measurements, a knowledge ofthe follow ing simple principle in mathematics is of great importance. \" The sum of the three angles of a triangle equals 180\u00b0,\" or, in more gen eral terms, \" Tlie sum of the angles of a polygon equals twice as"], [107, "COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. 91 many right angles as there are sides less two.\" If there are five sides, the figure contains 2x(5 \u2014 2)=6 right angles, or 540\u00b0. Having measured Qa6, (see fig., p. 43), when practicable, the angle Rba should also be measured. If the sum of the two angles thus obtained, equals 270\u00b0, we may be quite confident ofthe cor rectness of the measurement ; but if not, the measurement should be repeated. If the angle QPRis oblique, the sum ofthe two angles, Qa6 and Rba, may be obtained by adding to 180\u00b0 the angle QPR ; that is, if QPR=110\u00b0, 110\u00b0+180o=290\u00b0. If, then, we find by the goni ometer that the sum of the two angles equals 290\u00b0, the coincidence between observation and calculation is proof of accuracy. If there is not this coincidence, the measurements should be repeated. Errors may thus be corrected in the examination of crystals. VI. COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. 149. The compound crystalline structure of minerals is exhib ited either in distinct crystals having a composite character, or in aggregated crystallizations. The former are called Compound or Twin Crystals ; they have regular facets and the same perfec tion of outline and angle as simple crystals. The latter are aggre gations of numerous imperfect crystals, either laterally apposed, as in the fibrous structure, or confusedly mingled and compacted together, as in minerals of a granular structure. I. COMPOUND CRYSTALS. 150. Compound crystals are analogues of monsters in the animal kingdom. They may be composed of two united crystals, or of several. 151. Compound Crystals, composed of two individuals, or Twin Crystals. \u2014 Representations of some of these compound forms are given in the following figures, and in figs. 13, 14, 15, 16, pi. 3. Their structure may be imitated by cutting a model of a crystal in two halves, inverting one of the halves, (or revolving it 180\u00b0), and then applying it thus inverted to the other half, bringing the same sur faces in contact that were separated. Fig. 128, pi. 2, is an octa hedron, which is represented as cut in two in the plane, abed. If we revolve one half 60\u00b0 or 180\u00b0, and reapply it to the other, it produces the form in fig. 129. If a right rhombic prism be divided in a vertical plane, parallel to a lateral face, (fig. 130), and one of the parts be revolved half around, as it were on an axis passing from M to the opposite face, the form in fig. 131 is obtained. This is easily verified by actual trial. If the same rhombic prism were divided along a vertical diago-"], [108, "92 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. nal section, and a similar revolution of one half were made, no twin crystal would result that could be distinguished as such, ex cept by refraction. But with an oblique rhombic, in which the base is inclined to the lateral planes, a solid similar to that in fig. 14, pi. 3, is obtained ; or similar to figs. 35 and 36 following, repre senting crystals of feldspar, one a right-handed twin and the other left-handed ; the simple form is seen in fig. 1 under feldspar. Fig. 37 represents a twin of hornblende, in which composition has taken 35 36 37 Feldspar. Hornblende. place parallel to a section indicated by the dotted lines ; the simple form is shown in fig. 3 under Hornblende. The following figures illustrate a twin of Tin Ore. If the square 39 prism with pyramidal terminations, fig. 38, be cut diagonally from one solid angle to the opposite, and one part revolved upon the other 180\u00b0, it produces the form in fig. 39. Viewing the above examples with reference to the fundamental form in each case, we observe that in the first, composition has taken place parallel to a primary face ; in the second, parallel to a plane on an edge ; and in the last, parallel to a plane on an angle. Composi tion is thus in all cases parallel to some plane of simple sio-n and common occurrence. Fig. 3 under gypsum; 10, 11, 12, 13, under calcite; 2 under arragonite ; 4 under feldspar ; 4 under copper pyrites \u2014 are other examples of these modes of composition."], [109, "COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. 93 152. Fig. 16, plate 3, represents a scalene dodecahedron of cal cite, in which composition has apparently taken place, parallel to a horizontal section through its centre. By considering the situa tion ofthe primary rhombohedron in this solid, it is perceived that the composition is parallel to a plane truncating the terminal solid angle. This figure presents none of the faces of the rhombohedron, a fact which indicates the perfect uni'on that exists between the two indi viduals, \u2014 or rather, that their union was cotemporaneous with the commencement of their formation, and proceeds from the double nature of the nucleal molecule of the crystal. The same com plete union, begun evidently with the first molecule of the crystal, is indicated by each of the figures above referred to. The second ary planes have all the perfection and regularity of position char acterizing the simple crystal ; and the only irregularity is the com plete inversion of one half of the form. These twins are distinct from a kind of compound crystal, arising from the union of two crystals some time subsequent to the com mencement of their formation. The above are designated con natal compound crystals, the later postnatal ; the commencement in the former being cotemporaneous with that of the crystals com posing them, while in the latter, it is subsequent to the same. 153. Composition parallel to some plane on an edge or angle dif ferent from truncating planes, occasionally takes place in crystals that are hemihedrally modified. In the species iron pyrites, twins are of frequent occurrence compounded parallel to a face of a pentagonal dodecahedron. Observing that the edges of the cubes of this mineral are rarely truncated, but when modified, are usually replaced by the planes of this hemihedral solid, it is obvious that this peculiarity is owing to the same modification of the molecule that causes its hemihedral crystallizations. 154. A geniculated crystal of quartz has been described by Brooke, (Phil. Mag. May, 1837), in which composition had taken place parallel to a plane truncating a pyramidal edge. This plane referred to a rhombohedral primary, is an intermediary. But crystals of quartz are so uniformly modified hexagonal prisms, that we infer with reason that the hexagonal prism has the relations of a primary ; and referring the plane to this form the composition is parallel to a plane on an angle. 155. Compound Crystals, composed of more than two individu als. \u2014 The same kind of composition often takes place parallel to more than one primary face, edge, or angle, producing compound crystals composed of several individuals. Fig. 3, pi. 4, is a hex agonally prismatic crystal of White Lead Ore, in which composition has taken place parallel to two primary faces. This crystal resembles a secondary to a rhombohedron or hexagonal prism, but is distin guished by the inequality of its lateral angles. Fig. 5, plate 4, is a stellated form of carbonate of lead, in which the composition is parallel to all the lateral faces."], [110, "94 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The following are other forms. Fig. 40 is a stellated crystal of snow, consisting of six crystals diverging very regularly at angles 40 41 42 Snow. Staurotide. Chrysoberyl. of 60\u00b0. Fig. 41 is another of Staurotide, and fig. 42 one of Chry soberyl. Fig. 43 is a compound form of fluor spar, in which com 43 44 FluorSpar. Pyrites. position similar to that in fig. 128, plate 2, has taken place par allel to each of the octahedral faces. Fig. 44 is another of iron pyrites, compounded parallel to each face e' in the pentagonal dode cahedron, the simple form of which is shown in fig. 44, plate 1. Very complex forms are often produced by this mode of composition. Occasionally the same compound crystal exhibits two modes of composition at the same time. Forms of this kind have been ob served in sphene and calc spar. 156. Crystals are often grouped in linear series, and thus consti tute long threads or reticulations. Native copper and silver fre quently occur in strings of crystals, exemplifying this kind of combi nation. In clustered crystals, it is very generally a fact that adjoining crystals are united by a plane parallel to one of the principal sec tions or more common secondary planes, as parallel to the trunca ting plane of an edge or angle ; and sometimes parallel to other secondary planes, when they are of common occurrence in the spe cies. Senarmont mentions the union in galena paralel to the octa hedral faces as common, and also describes an instance where the union was parallel to the plane 30f. 157. The positions of crystals on the supporting rock seem at first"], [111, "95 COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. to be without any regularity. By closer inspection we detect even here the same law of harmony that governs the formation of the simple and compound crystal. The various positions assumed cor respond generally with the three kinds of composition in twin crystals. Brooke observes with respect to certain artificial crystallizations of nitrate of lead, that some of the octahedrons \" had their axes perpendicular to the surfaces on which they rested\" \u2014 \" others rested on one of their planes, and others were attached by an edge to the bottom of the vessel ;\" thus exemplifying each of the three kinds of composition. This regularity is not always manifest on account of the unevenness of the surface on which they rest. In general, however, on glancing the eye over a surface covered with crystals, a reflection from one face will be accompanied with reflections from the corresponding face in each of the other crystals, showing that the crystals are similar throughout in their positions. This tendency to parallelism in the positions of associated crystals is even apparent in crystalline aggregates. In granite, for example, which is composed of feldspar, quartz, and mica, the feldspar crys tallizations have usually a common position ; that is, the corres ponding extremities lie in the same direction, or nearly so. On this account granite is cleavable in one direction more easily than in others, and this direction is that of the pefect cleavage plane of the feldspar. The parallel positions of the mica in gneiss causes the fissile character of that rock. 158. Postnatal Compound Crystals. \u2014 We have already defined postnatal twins to be those in which composition has taken place after each crystal had attained some considerable size. Fig. 11, under Quartz, represents one of these double crystals. The simple crystals in these instances are uniformly united by similar parts, and, conse quently, have their similar faces parallel. Groups or aggregations of crystals of various sizes, are frequent ly instances of postnatal composition. Often, 45 however, the aggregation is very irregular. Another mode of postnatal composition is observed in doubly geniculated crystals, as those of rutile, annexed figure, and figure 12, plate 4. The geniculations take place at equal distances either side of the centre of the crystal, and are evidently the result of some cause acting after the crystal had begun to form. The geniculation is usually parallel to a plane of common occurrence, either one of those of the fundamental form, or its simplest modifications. Rutile. Characteristics of Compound Crystals. \u2014 Compound crystals may usually be distinguished by their reentering angles, or by the stri\u00e6 on their surfaces. These stri\u00e6 meet at an angle in the line where composition has taken place."], [112, "96 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. II. AGGREGATIONS OF IMPERFECT CRYSTALS. 159. The greater part of the specimens or masses of minerals that occur on our globe, may be described as aggregations of im perfect crystals. Even those whose structure appears the most purely impalpable, and the most destitute internally of any thing like crystallization, are probably composed of crystalline grains. We, consequently, include under the above head, all the remaining varieties of structure in the mineral kingdom. The only certain exceptions are liquids and gases, which require so few remarks, that a separate caption for them is unnecessary. The individuals composing imperfectly crystallized individuals, may be, 1. Columns, or fibres, in which case the structure is columnar. 2. Thin lamin\u00e6, producing a lamellar structure. 3. Grains, constituting a granular structure. 1. Columnar Structure. 160. A mineral possesses a columnar structure, when it is made up of slender columns or fibres. There are the following varieties of the columnar structure. Fibrous : when the columns or fibres are parallel. Ex. gypsum, asbestus. Fibrous minerals have often a silky lustre. Reticulated : when the fibres or columns cross in various direc tions, and produce an appearance having some resemblance to a net. Stellated or stellular : when they radiate from a centre in all directions, and produce star-like forms. Ex. stilbite, wavellite. Radiated, divergent : when the crystals radiate from a centre, without producing stellar forms. Ex. quartz, gray antimony. 2. Lamellar Structure. 161. The structure of a mineral is lamellar, when it consists of plates or leaves. The lamin\u00e6 may be curved or straight, and thus give rise to the curved lamellar, and straight lamellar structure. Ex. tabular spar, some varieties of gypsum, talc, &c. When the lamin\u00e6 are thin and easily separable, the structure is said to be fo liaceous. Mica is a striking example, and the term micaceous is often used to describe this kind of structure. 3. Granular Structure. 162. The particles in a granular structure differ much in size. When coarse, the mineral is described as coarsely granular : when fine, finely granular ; and if not distinguishable by the naked eye, the structure is termed impalpable. Examples of the first may be"], [113, "97 COMPOUND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. observed in granular carbonate of lime ; of the second, in some va rieties of specular iron ; of the last, in chalcedony, opal, and other species. The above terms are indefinite, but from necessity, as there is every degree of fineness of structure in the mineral species, from perfectly impalpable, through all possible shades, to the coarsest granular. Granular minerals, when easily crumbled in the fingers, are said to be friable. 4. Imitative Shapes. 163. Reniform : kidney shape. The structure may be radiating or concentric. Botryoidal : consisting of a group of rounded prominences. The name is derived from the Greek \u20acor\u00a3us, a bunch of grapes. Ex. limonite, chalcedony^. Mammillary : resembling the botryoidal, but composed of larger prominences. Globular : spherical or nearly so ; the globules may consist of radiating fibres or concentric coats. When attached, as they usu ally are, to the surface of a rock, they are described as implanted globules. Filiform or Capillary : very slender and long like a thread or hair. Acicular : slender and rigid like a needle. Reticulated : net-like. Drusy : closely covered with minute implanted crystals. Stalactitic : when the mineral occurs in pendant columns, cylin ders, or elongated cones. Stalactites are produced by the percolation of water, holding mineral matter in solution, through the rocky roofs of caverns. The evaporation of the water produces a deposit of the mineral matter, and gradually forms a long pendant cylinder or cone. The internal structure may be imperfectly crystalline and granular, or mayr consist of fibres radiating from the central column, or may have a broad cross-cleavage. Common stalactites consist of carbonate of lime. Chalcedony, gibbsite, brown iron ore, and many other species, also present sta lactitic forms. Amorphous : having no regular structure or form either crys talline or imitative. The word is from the Greek a and fwp<pr], shape. 13"], [114, "98 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. VII. PSEUDOMORPHOUS CRYSTALS.* 164. A pseudomorphous crystal possesses a form that is foreign to the species to which the substance belongs. a. Crystals sometimes undergo a change of composition from aqueous\" agency or some other cause, without losing their form : for example, octahedrons of spinel change to steatite, still retaining the octahedral form ; cubes of pyrites are altered to red or brown iron ore ; anhydrite becomes gypsum by the addition of water. 6. Again : crystals are sometimes removed entirely, and at the same time, and with equal progress, another mineral is substituted : for example, cubes of fluor spar may be transformed to quartz, without a change of form. The petrifaction of wood is of the same kind. This process may extend only to the surface of a crys tal ; and if its interior is subsequently dissolved out, a hollow pseu domorph results. c. Again : cavities left empty by a decomposed crystal are refilled by another species, by infiltration, and the new (hineral takes on the external form of the original mineral, as a fused metal copies the form of the mould into which it is cast. A cubic crystal of salt in clay, for example, is removed by percolating water, and the cubical cavity is afterwards filled by gypsum. d. Again : crystals are sometimes incrusted over by other min erals, as cubes of fluor by quartz ; and when the fluor is afterwards dissolved away, as sometimes happens, hollow cubes of quartz are left. 165. The pseudomorphs of the first kind here mentioned are pseudomorphs by alteration ; those of the second, pseudomorphs by replacement ; those of the third, pseudomorphs by infiltration ; those of the fourth, pseudomorphs by incrustation. 166. These several processes are not always wholly7 distinct, or distinguishable in the result. It may be difficult to determine, in the case of many silicified crystals, whether there has been a grad ual replacement of the mineral by the new material, while removal was in equal progress, as is true of petrified wood, or whether the cavity was first formed and then the silica was infiltrated. It may be doubtful, also, in many cases, whether the change by incrusta tion was not actually a change by replacement for the exterior of the original crystal, and then this process ceasing after a thin layer of new material was formed, the remaining part of the old crystal within was subsequently removed by solution. Much investiga- * For much information on this subject, Science is indebted to W. Haidinger, whose early views are published in Brewster's Edinb. Jour., vols. ix and x, and more recently in his Handb. der bestimmenden Mineralogie, Vienna, 1845, where his views on pseudomorphism are fully detailed. Extensive and important investigations have also been made by Dr. J. Reinhard Blum, who published an 8vo. volume of 378 pp., entitled Die Pseudomor phosen des Mineralreichs, at Stuttgart, in 1843, and a Supplement of 213 pp., in 1847. \u2014 See a review of this work, in Am. Jour. Sci. xlviii, p. 66, and remarks by the author, p. 81."], [115, "PSEUDOMORPHOUS CRYSTALS. 99 tion of the subject, and as far as possible, a study of actual cases in progress, may be required, before each instance of pseudomorphism shall be referable to its place in one of the four divisions here laid down. The petrifaction of wood is a plain instance of replacement ; for here every fibre of the original wood is usually copied with the utmost perfection. 167. The process by which pseudomorphs of the first two kinds (by alteration and replacement) are produced is chemical in its na tuae. In the first, it depends on chemical affinities and attendant causes alone, acting either with or without water, and the water, when present, either cold or heated. In the second, the process of solution and substitution is not less chemical. When a substance is undergoing the change of state called solution, the molecular forces are in excited action, and if any other substance is present just then passing from the liquid to a solid state, the passage of the former to the liquid state appears to aid by a transfer of force or by induction, in causing the change to a solid state in the latter, molecule for molecule, and thus the replacement is gradual and successive, and every minutest stria is copied. With regard to pseudomorphs of the last two kinds, the process is altogether mechanical. It is sjpiply the filling of a ready-made mould, or the incrusting of a model 168. The following is a list ofthe pseudomorphs that have thus far been described, taken from the valuable work by Dr. Blum. For the convenience of reference we distribute them under the heads, I. Pseudomorphs having one or more elements of the original mineral : and, II. Pseudomorphs without any element of the original mineral. It should, however, be remembered, that when a pseudomorph contains an element identical with one in the original mineral, it is still possible in some cases, that in the process of change, the whole of the original species was removed, and the substitute intro duced as a whole.

Many species become gradually hydrated as alteration or decom position commences. Iolite is an example of this, and orthite, some micas, and probably feldspar and other species. The mineral has still the original form, and not unfrequently this form has been consid ered, quite erroneously, the crystalline form of the hydrous mineral. Such hydrous species are pseudomorphs, and should not be con founded with those hydrous minerals whose water was an essential ingredient at their crystallization, and upon which, in part, the form depends. 169. The discussion ofthe origin of these various pseudomorphs belongs rather to Chemistry or Chemical Geology, than to the Sci ence of Mineralogy. But few remarks, therefore, are added in this place. a. The change of carbonate of lime to sulphate of lime or gyp sum, is an example of the simple expulsion of carbonic acid by sul phuric acid, the latter resulting either from the aqueous decompo sition of a sulphuret, as iron pyrites, or from the evolution of sul phur gases by heat or volcanic action. Alterations of this kind have taken place on a large scale in nature. 6. Large deposits of anhydrite have been changed to gypsum by the absorption of water at the common temperature. At Bex, in Switzerland, is a fine example. On digging down sixty or one hun dred feet, the unaltered anhydrite is reached. c. The change of feldspar to kaolin is of common occurrence, and takes place from the simple decomposition of the feldspar under the action of water, either pure or carbonated. 3 atoms of feld spar together, consist of 3 parts of alumina, 3 of potash, and 12 of silica. If 3 parts of potash and 8 of silica be removed, it leaves 3 of alumina and 4 of silica, which is the composition of kaolin, except that 6 of water are added. d. Steatite constitutes many different pseudomorphs. In the change to hornblende, a removal only of lime is required. Ca Si+ Mg3 Si2, dropping Ca, becomes 3(Mg Si). Usually in this and other cases, some water is added, the steatite being commonly hy drated. Steatitic spinels occur in the granular limestone of Sus sex Co., N. J., and of Orange Co., N. Y., and are common else where. The change is a simple substitution of silica for alumina ; thus Mg Al becomes Mg Si. The Rensselaerite of Northern New York is an interesting example ofthe change of augite to steatite, on a large scale. e. The crystals of serpentine described, have the form of those of chrysolite, and have been supposed to be altered chrysolite, though of this there is much doubt.

Ann., 1835), remarked that 4 of chrysolite, (Mg12 Si4) giving up 3Mg and taking 6H, become 2Mg3 Si2+3Mg H2, or serpentine."], [119, "103 PRACTICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 170. The dissolving powers of heated waters, especially those of the ocean, from submarine volcanic action, must have been active in many pseudomorphic changes, particularly those requiring some thing more than atmospheric causes at the ordinary temperature. Silica is readily taken up under these circumstances, as shown about the geysers of volcanic regions, and on cooling, it is again deposited. This fact, in connection with its common occurrence in small quantities in all waters, accounts for the frequency of sili ceous pseudomorphs. Marine waters also contain magnesian salts, and therefore, when heated, are fitted for those changes in which magnesia is concerned ; and the cases of this kind are of very wide extent, and great geological influence. 171. Pseudomorphous crystals are distinguished, generally, by their rounded angles, dull surfaces, and often granular composition. They either have no cleavage, or the cleavage is wholly different in direction from that of the mineral imitated. Their surfaces are frequently drusy, or covered with minute crystals. Occasionally the resemblance to real crystals is so perfect, that they are distin guished with difficulty. SECTION II. CRYSTALLOGENY. 172. Crystallogeny, or the formation of Crystals, may be treated of either in a practical point of view, by a review of the processes of crystallization and attendant circumstances ; or theoretically, by considering the nature of molecular attraction in crystallization, and the laws under which it acts. I. PRACTICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 173. Crystallization may take place either from a solution of a crystallizable material ; from a state of fusion by heat ; from a state of vapor, another condition dependent on temperature ; from a solid state without fusion, under a continued elevation of temper ature. The crystallization of sugar or alum is a common example of the first mode ; the formation of ice, of the second ; the produc tion of snow from vapor, of the third ; and the usual mode of hard ening steel or changing its temper, (since it depends on varying the size of the crystalline grains), is an example of the fourth. All solidification of inorganic matter is crystallization, and the solid con dition is arrived at in one or the other of these methods. Fre-"], [120, "104 CRYSTALLOGENY. quently, however, the solid is formed immediately upon the combina tion of the elements that constitute it, or upon the liberation of the substance from some other state of combination. 174. The formation of distinct crystals usually requires a freedom from disturbing causes, a slow rate of progress in the pro cess, and a large supply of material, or else a gradual supply lrom some constant source. In many instances a crystal that has been long out of a solution, may be restored and further enlarged. Crystals frequently contain parallel layers of other substances, as of pyrites, which have been formed during intermissions in the crystallizing process. In a large rhombohedron of calcite from Rossie, the plane a, could be distinguished by a layer of pyrites, al though there was no such plane externally. The crystal once had such a plane, and the pyrites was then 46 deposited ; but subsequently the rhom bohedron was finished out, and with out any lateral enlargement. The an nexed figure represents another crys tal from Rossie, in which the sides were enlarged after an intermission, without additions to a, and conse quently there is a raised ridge around this plane. The cap quartz is another example of intermitted crystallization. 175. Crystallization without a change from the solid state, is well illustrated by facts mentioned to the author by Mr. N. P. Ames. If a bar of tempered steel, bent in the form of a semicircle, be heated on the inner side, when the heat has reached a certain point, the bar may easily be bent around and made to curve in the opposite direction. He states that until the moment when the requisite temperature is acquired, the bar does not yield ; but at this mo ment, a change takes place which is distinctly felt in the hands, and the bar at once bends. He carefully measured the inner and outer curves of the bar, after thus bending it, and found them of the same length as before. This shows that there had been no com pression of the particles on the inner side, which would have short ened that side, and therefore, also, that there was actually a free dom of motion among the particles on either side. He observes, moreover, that the elasticity of the inner and outer sides was the same, which would not have been the case were the former com pressed. By the old method of restoring a warped sword-blade it was rendered unequally elastic, and would spring more easily on one side than the other ; but by the means here explained, the elas ticity is perfectly equal on both sides. Here, then, there is a change in the position of the particles throughout the bar, pro duced by a temperature very far short of fusion. The same ex periment was often repeated, and he found that, at every time he bent the steel, the temperature required was a little above that at"], [121, "105 PRACTICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. which it bent the preceding time. The change resulting from friction or long repeated concussion, is probably owing to the com bined action of the heat thus excited, and the vibration that takes place. Mr. Ames states instances in which a large bar of iron, used as an axle through a heavy wheel of cast iron, broke square off in the middle, after use for a few months ; and in one case, there were two other fractures on either side of the centre. In these instances, the bar was rendered coarsely crystalline, and was wholly unlike the original iron. The accident which took place in 1842, on the Versailles railroad, was owing to the breaking of an axle, which was rendered brittle by the same cause. 176. The same process \u2014 long continued heat without fusion \u2014 has acted widely in nature, producing probably the crystalline struc ture of granular limestone, and many other crystalline rocks, and originating, in certain cases, the groups of crystals in these rocks. Matter of like kinds tends strongly to segregate together ; and when a material is distributed as an impurity7 through a rock, as phosphate or fluorid of lime through limestone, it may slowly collect in cavi ties, and leave the limestone nearly or quite pure of them. Thus it is, we may believe, that crystallizations of fluor spar and apa tite originate in limestone. The limestone being formed of animal remains, the material of these minerals is necessarily present.* 177. Causes of secondary planes. \u2014 Beudant, in his treatise on Mineralogy,f in which this subject has received some attention, states as the principal cause of secondary planes, the nature of the solvent, and of the substances it holds in solution. He remarks, that when the solvent contains, mechanically sus pended, minute particles of foreign matter, the crystals formed con tain more or less of these foreign particles regularly arranged, either in concentric layers with the lamin\u00e6 of the crystal, or in the direction of a diagonal, or occasionally intermingled without regu lar order ; and that the crystals thus impure, are more simple and regular than those obtained from a clear liquid. Crystals of quartz are seldom perfectly regular bipyramidal prisms, except when they contain large portions of chlorite or oxyd of iron. But if the sol vent contains other substances in solution, either solid, liquid, or * The author omits much that is introduced in previous editions, on the formation! of crystals, and would refer to them for the facts there stated : also to his Memoirs in the American Journal of Science, on the formation of floor spar, apatite, and chondrodite, in limestone, second series, vol. ii, p. 88 ; and on the minerals of trap and the allied rocks, voL xlix, 49.

But in a solution of boracic acid, it always occurs with trun cated angles,\" (fig. 2, pi. 1). The Rev. E. Craig, in an interesting article on Microscopic Chemistry, in the Lond. and Ed. Phil. Mag. and Jour, of Science, July, 1836, p. 13, states the following remark able transformations in crystals of carbonate of copper, produced by a change in the nature of the solvent : \" If sulphuric acid be added to carbonate of copper, crystals speedily appear, presenting the form of six-sided tabular prisms. Add a little ammonia, the form is changed entirely to a long rectangular prism, with the angles re placed. Add a little more ammonia, and the form changes to sev eral varieties of the rhombic octahedron : a little nitric acid restores again the form of the rectangular prism. In all these successive changes, it is not that a few crystals of another form have been superadded, but each time the metamorphosis is seen to take place in the whole mass.\" There are many evidences that the same cause has operated in nature to produce the peculiar secondary planes a crystal presents. Arragonite, in iron mines, crystallizes in very acute pyramidal crys tals ; but in the gypsum clays, accompanying the saliferous depos its, it always appears in prismatic crystals, grouped so as to form hexagonal prisms. Other similar instances might be added; but this will suffice to establish the fact, that secondary planes often arise from the peculiar nature of the solvent. 178. Another cause may be the electrical state of the rock sup porting the crystal, and also its nature. M. Planiava has observed that, in some instances, in which the form of the floating crystal was the primary, it assumed secondary planes as soon as it attached itself to the sides of the vessel.* 179. In some instances, secondary planes proceed from some per manent peculiarity in the molecule ; for, without this supposition, we cannot account for the invariableness in the occurrence of a particular secondary form of some minerals ; for example, the pris matic form in quartz, whose primary is a rhombohedron. 180. The influence of magnetism or electricity on crystallization, has received some attention of late, especially from Mr. Robert Hunt. By placing the poles of a horse-shoe magnet against a glass vessel or a plate of glass, in or on which crystallization was in pro gress, he has found the crystals to be guided in their positions by the poles of a magnet. The facts he has developed have a bear ing upon the uniformity of position in crystallizations over large areas. But other causes have aided in directing the crystalline structure of rocks, and among them the pressure to which the materi al was subjected during crystallization may be the most important. f * Kastner's Archiv.

Speculations on the nature of molecules have displayed the in genuity of men of science in various ages ofthe world. The Grecian philosophers, to account for the various phenomena in nature, im agined the ultimate particles of matter to be at different times \"round, oval, lenticular, flat, gibbous, oblong, conical, smooth, rough, quad rilateral,\"* and, to afford these atoms the means of uniting in the production of compounds, provided them with hooks. The inves tigations of modern times have not, indeed, answered the inquiry, what is this plastic power in nature ; but philosophers have been led to satisfy themselves with calling it by the general term, at traction, a term rather expressing the fact, that particles combine, than explaining the nature of this power.

With Nicolaus Steno, towards the latter part of the 17th cen tury, commences a new era. This author examined minutely the different forms of several minerals, and first deduced the important principle afterwards rediscovered, that, although the faces of crys tals are subject to frequent variations of form, their inclinations remain constant* In the commencement of the 18th century, Gulielmini published on the crystallizations of the salts, and ad vanced another principle equally fundamental, that cleavage in crystals of the same substance yields constantly the same forms. Gulielmini was led, by his observations, to the same conclusions as the Abbe Haiiy, namely, that the elementary corpuscles of bodies possess those simple forms which may be obtained from crystals by cleavage. f He neglected, however, to extend his investiga tions on this subject, and left to Rome de Lisle and Haiiy the honor of founding the science of Crystallography. Several writers on these subjects appeared during the half cen tury following Gulielmini ; but they made no essential additions to facts. \u2014 The theory of tetrahedral atoms was proposed by Ludwig Bourguet.J J. Woodward makes quartz crystal the source of all crystalliza tions, concerning which he thus expresses himself in his treatise on his collection of \" English Fossils,\"\u00a7 p. 146 : \" There is in all spar more or less crystal, which renders it more or less diaphanous,\" &c. Again, p. 220 : \" Crystal, pure and without mixture of other matter, concretes even into an hexagonal figure, pyramidal or columnar, terminating in an apex or point. Mineral or metallic matter con creting with it, frequently determines it to other figures peculiar to the disposition of each kind of that matter. Iron concreting with crystal, determines it to a rhomboidal figure; tin, to a quadrilate ral pyramid ; lead, to a cubic.\" Somewhat similar was the opinion of Linn\u00e6us, who supposed that all crystals contained a salt, and to this owed their crystalliza tion. || This theory obtained considerable credit at that time.

Borlase : \" 'Tis by the force of salts that liquid bodies are thrown into all the geometrical planes, angles, and more com pounded shapes, the variety of which is no less surprising, than the constancy and uniformity of each particular species.\" The discov eries in chemistry soon dissipated these views, and at last established philosophers on this settled ground, that the power of crystallization is naturally and independently inherent in all inorganic matter. Immediately preceding the commencement of the Abbe Haiiy 's very successful scientific career, appeared Bergman, Werner, and Rome de Lisle. Bergman has the honor of discovering the prima ry forms of crystals, and Rome de Lisle that of first measuring their angles, and thus rendering crystallography subservient to the pur poses of the mineralogist. 182. Hauy seems to have entered on his studies with an entire ignorance of the results of Bergman and Gulielmini, and in all his observations was an original investigator. A mere accident, the dropping of a crystal from his hands and its fracture in conse quence, exhibited to him the rhombohedral particles of carbonate of lime. He was thus led to commence his investigations, and with his philosophic mind soon arrived at general conclusions with re gard to the primary forms. \u2014 An obvious theory as to their struc ture, that already proposed by Gulielmini, was the next result of his investigations. The primary cube he imagined to be constituted of cubic molecules, for cubes, and cubes only, can be obtained by mechanical division. Similarly, the rhombohedron was formed of rhombohedral molecules. Investigations, with respect to the situation of secondary planes, and the laws which govern their formation, gave Haiiy what ap peared to be additional proof of the correctness of his theory. He discovered that the secondary planes on the edges of crystals might be exactly imitated by composing a primary of its molecules, and dropping one row (or, in his phraseology, by a decrement of one row) of particles, in height and breadth, (fig. 132, pi. 2), or, two rows in one direction, and one in the other, (fig. 133), and so in some simple ratio for all planes. These splendid results proved that the science of Crystallography was founded on a mathematical basis, and they seemed to establish the truth of Haiiy's views, on the same sure foundation. It appeared, however, to be a difficulty, that cleavage was ob tained, in some instances, parallel to two primaries at the same time. The rhombic prism, besides its rhombic cleavage-, admitted of cleavage parallel to a diagonal, thus dividing it into two three sided prisms. Again, octahedrons could not be composed of octa hedral molecules, except by leaving large spaces, to fill which, tetra hedrons were necessary. Haiiy surmounted the first difficulty, by supposing the molecules to be composed of still simpler solids, which he called integrant molecules. These are the tetrahedron, the three-"], [126, "110 CRYSTALLOGENY. sided prism, and the parallelopiped. The se'cond difficulty however remained, and could only be avoided by the improbable hypothesis of two nucleal solids, an octahedron and a tetrahedron. 183. The difficulties lay unremoved, when Dr. Wollaston brought forward his ingenious views on the spherical forms ofthe molecules of bodies, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1813. It is easily conceived, that many of the primary solids in crystallography may be formed by the regular aggregation of spheres. Two four-sided pyramids of shot, (similar to those frequently seen in arsenals), placed base to base, form the regular octahedron, (fig. 134). If, to the octahedron, two three-sided pyramids are added, (tetrahedrons, fig. 136), one to each of two opposite faces, a rhombohedron is formed, (fig. 135). A rhombohedron of this kind is easily obtained in the cleaving of fluor spar ; it is reduced to the octahedron by separating two tetrahedrons. Rhombohedrons, however, occur of various angles. To obtain these, it is only necessary to suppose the particles of other rhom bohedrons to be spheroids, instead of spheres ; spheroids are also his molecules of the prisms. The formation of the cube is illus trated by Dr. Wollaston, as follows : \" Let a mass of matter be supposed to consist of spherical particles, all of the same size, but of two different kinds in equal numbers, represented by black and white balls ; and let it be required that, in their perfect in termixture, every black ball shall be equally distant from all sur rounding white balls, and that all adjacent balls of the same de nomination shall also be equidistant from each other. I say, then, that these conditions will be fulfilled, if the arrangement be cu bical, and that the particles will be in equilibrio.\" He had pre viously stated, that \" a cube may evidently be put together of spher ical particles, arranged four and four above each other ; but this is not the form which simple spheres are naturally disposed to as sume, and, consequently, this hypothesis alone is not adequate to its explanation.\" This theory is in some respects far more simple than that of Haiiy. Yet it is manifest, that it received but sparingly the attention of the philosophic mind of Dr. Wollaston. The cube and rhombohe dron are similar solids, differing merely in that the latter is oblique. It is surely improbable, that their atomic arrangements should be as different as Wollaston's theory supposes ; or with reference to the cube alone, that its formation, or even the explanation of it, should require two kinds of particles. 184. Other theories have been proposed, but only one seems to require a notice in this place, before entering upon that which ap pears to afford the best explanation of the phenomena. I refer to the Chemical theory, as it may be called, since chemical facts are usually explained by a reference to its principles. According to this theory, the atoms of the elements are either spheres or sphe roids, and the molecules of compounds result from a juxtaposition"], [127, "111 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. of the elementary atoms. These elementary atoms, moreover, are so arranged, that the compound molecule has the shape of the pri mary form of the compound. It will be remembered that crystals are solids of definite dimen sions, and constant angles, exhibiting a perfect symmetry in their several parts, and an exact regularity in the occurrence of second ary planes. In order, therefore, that the similar parts of a crystal should be similarly modified, there should be a corresponding simi larity in the different parts of a molecule. The molecule of the cube, besides having the form of a cube, should present a unifor mity of character on its six opposite parts, corresponding to the faces of the cube. Such molecules, it is evident, cannot be formed by the juxtaposition of the elementary atoms. An atom of sul phur, the primary of which is a rhombic octahedron, united to an atom of lead, whose primary is the regular octahedron, could not in any way be made to receive the cubic form of galena. Nor were the molecules equal spheres, would it be a less difficult task ; and if the form were possible, still the compound molecule would not contain similar atoms in its similar parts, and could not possess that symmetrical character necessary to account for the regularity in the occurrence of secondary planes. Such examples might be multiplied indefinitely. The chemical theory is equally unsatisfactory, in all attempts to account for crystallographic phenomena. Indeed, it may be con sidered as formed merely for illustrating combinations in a lecture room. In the explanations of optical phenomena, it has been re jected by the principal theorists, who, in accounting for the double refraction of crystals, suppose the molecules to have spherical and ellipsoidal forms, and a homogeneous structure. Without farther introduction, I proceed to explain what is con ceived to be the most probable view of the nature of molecules and molecular action in the formation of crystals. ON CRYSTALLINE MOLECULES.* 185. By crystalline molecule is understood, the molecule in the state peculiar to it, when about to enter into the constitution of a crystal, or when a constituent part of a crystal. Evidently, some important change takes place in molecules, at the time of crys tallization. The moment before, when in the liquid state, they are in close connection, but move freely among themselves ; in the act of crystallization, they unite, almost instantaneously, and are firmly compacted in the hard, unyielding crystal. * The following views on crystallogeny were first published by the author in the American Journal of Science, 1836, xxx, 275, in an article on the Formation of Compound or Twin Crystals."], [128, "112 CRYSTALLOGENY. 186. Forms of Molecules. \u2014 Adopting the idea of spherical and spheroidal molecules, we suppose the molecule of each primary to be that spheroidal body- or ellipsoid, which,* described within the prism, touches the centres of its faces. These molecules, by their aggregation, will build up the same forms that proceed from the aggregation of Haiiy's polyhedral molecules ; for they have the same proportional height, breadth, and thickness, and therefore, by combination, must produce a primary of the same dimensions. f 187. Crystallogenic Attraction. \u2014 Crystallogenic attraction, and the attraction exerted in solidification, appear to be one and the same ; and consequently the subject before us is that of solidifica tion in general. Attraction acting in every direction from the centre of a par ticle, will cause an addition of particles in no fixed direction, and must invariably produce a spherical solid. Proof of this fact is observed in every drop of water, or globule of mercury, whose sphe ricity results from this condition of attraction. To form solids, * The following remarks are made in explanation of the solids, termed ellipsoids, or solid ellipses, and their conjugate axes and diameters. AA' BB' is a plane ellipse. AB, A'B', two lines crossing at right angles, are termed its conjugate axes ; a'b', ab, are con jugate diameters. The relative situation of the conjugate diam- eters is such, that if a hne be drawn, touching the ellipse at a, the extremity of one diameter ab, it will be parallel to the other a'b'. When ab and a'b' are equal, they are termed the equal conjugate diameters ; when they intersect at right angles, they are conjugate axes. The revolution of a plane semi-ellipse, AB'B, around one axis, describes the surface of a solid, which is denominated an ellipsoid of revolution. The ellipsoid of revolution has its sec- tions in one direction, circles. If these sections are ellipses, the solid is still an ellipsoid, but not one of revolution, as the simple revolution of a plane ellipse will not describe it. The axes of ellipsoids are three, and intersect at right angles. The three conjugate diameters are any lines so drawn that a plane touchiug the ellipsoid at the extremity of one, is parallel to the plane in which tlie other diameters are situated. Each face of a prism, which touches the ellipsoid at the extremity of one crystallogenic axis, ia necessa rily parallel to the plane in which the other two axes are situated, (figs. 1, 3, 7, plate 3). Consequently, the crystallogenic axes (lines connecting the centres of opposite faces) are always the conjugate diameters of the ellipsoid, and, if they intersect at right angles, are the conjugate axes. f The above approaches the view of Brewster, deduced from the study of the refrac tion of crystallized and other substances, and published in 1830 ; but this philosopher considers the form of the molecule not that of the spheroid which may be inscribed within a primary, but another spheroid of such dimensions that the change of form superinduced upon it by the forces of aggregation determines the exact form oi* the combination. The form of the ultimate molecules of crystals existing separately, are regarded as deter mining only within certain limits the primitive form to which they belong ; while the precise form of the crystal and its doubly refracting structure are produced by the action of the forces of aggregation. He also speaks of the axes being always at right angles with one another, which is not always true of the optical axes, and cannot be of the crys tallogenic. The progress of Science will probably soon clear up these doubtful points.\u2014 See Brewster on Double Refraction, Transactions Royal Society for 1830, and American Journal of Science, xxi, 296 ; also an article by the author, American Journal of Science [2], iv, 364."], [129, "113 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. bounded by a definite number of surfaces, there must be a definite number of directions for the exertion of attraction. If attraction is exerted in but one direction, the particles will unite only in this direction, and by their union will form only a single line of spheres ; exertion in two directions will, in a similar manner, produce a figure of two dimensions only, that is, a plane ; in three directions, a figure of three dimensions, or a solid bounded by six faces, as the cube. For the construction of prisms, it is therefore necessary that the mutual attraction of the particles be strongest in three fixed directions in each molecule. These fixed directions may be denominated axes, and their extremities, poles ; the two, relatively, positive and negative, or north and south. This polar character is a fundamental law of molecular force. In each instance, the axes connect the centres of the faces of the prism ; for action in these directions only can produce solids like the prisms. The attraction within a molecule is not supposed to be confined to the extremities of the axes. On the contrary, every portion of the surface exerts attraction. But the attraction is strongest at the poles, and weakest at an intermediate point between them. The crystallogenic axes of the cube are three equal lines inter secting each other at right angles, and hence the molecule is a sphere, with three equal conjugate axes, as axes of attraction, (fig. 1, plate 3). Influenced by these axes, the spheres will combine, as in fig. 2, and a cube will be formed in the same manner as by the aggregation of an equal number of cubes. The square prism has its breadth and width equal, but a varying length ; and the molecule, consequently, is an ellipsoid of revolution, (fig. 3), with rectangular axes. The rectangular prism has three unequal di mensions, and therefore the ellipsoidal molecule is not an ellipsoid of revolution. Fig. 4 is a transverse section of the prism and ellip soid. The axes are rectangular, as in the preceding forms. The right rhombic prism has a similar molecule to that of the rectangu lar prism, but its lateral crystallogenic axes, which connect the centres of opposite faces, are obliquely inclined to one another ; and being equal, are the equal conjugate diameters, instead of con jugate axes. The vertical axis, as in the preceding prisms, is still one ofthe conjugate axes. The same is the fact with the right rhom boidal prism ; but its lateral axes are unequal, (fig. 6), and may be any unequal conjugate diameters of the ellipsoid, at right angles with the vertical axis. In the oblique prisms, the vertical axis is inclined, and is not therefore one of the conjugate axes, but a conjugate diameter to each of the lateral axes, which are also conjugate diameters. The lateral conjugate diameters are equal in the rhombic, but unequal in the rhomboidal prism. In the rhombohedron, the lines connect ing the centres of opposite faces are equal, and consequently the ellipsoid is one of revolution, and the three crystallogenic axes, its 15"], [130, "114 CRYSTALLOGENY. equal conjugate diameters, figures 7a, and lb. The dotted let ters in the above figures are supposed to be situated on the back faces.* 188.

Moreover, we perceive that all the prismatic primaries may pro ceed from one simple solid, an ellipsoid, (a sphere being an ellip soid with equal rectangular axes), and all may result from a varia tion merely, in the length and direction of the conjugate diameters of this solid. 189. It has been stated that the axes of attraction have polarity. It may be inferred, with reference to the rhombohedron, that the three poles about each vertical solid angle are of the same name, those about one, north, and those about the other, south ; in crys tals of tourmaline there is then some correspondence between the crystallogenic poles and those induced by heat. The po larity in any case must vary with the condition or position of the crystal with reference to surrounding matter. Examples of a change from such a cause are found in some compound crystals, alluded to on a following page. 190. Laws governing the Crystalline Molecules in the formation of the Primary Solids. \u2014 The molecules of matter in the act of crystallization, must be subservient to the usual law of attraction, the repulsion of like poles and the attraction of unlike ; that is, two norths or two souths repel, a north and a south mutually attract. There is this peculiarity, that only the unlike poles of similar axes can unite. An attraction exists between the north pole of the vertical axis of one molecule, and the south pole of the vertical of another ; but none between the north of the vertical axis, and the south of a lateral, when the lateral and vertical are unlike axes. * The rhombohedron thus formed differs materially from that proposed by Wollaston, (fig. 135. pi. 2). The molecules influenced by these axes will take an arrangement simdar to that in the cube and other prisms."], [131, "115 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. This is a natural inference from the general nature of attraction. It also proceeds from the nature of axial attraction, that similar axes will by their union form a straight line ; that is, will unite as in fig. 9, plate 3, and not as in fig. 11. 191. Connatal Compound Crystals. \u2014 The mutual influence of the molecules causes them to assume the parallel position of figure 9, plate 3, unless some peculiar circumstances operate to prevent it. During the formation of crystals, myriads of which are sometimes produced at a single process of crystallization, it must be no uncom mon occurrence that two molecules, in close proximity, assuming simultaneously their axes, should have the position given in fig. 10, plate 3. A north and south pole are here adjacent, as in figure 9 ; but the north pole of the other axis in one molecule, has the direc tion of the south pole in the other molecule. The natural tendency to an inversion of one molecule, in order that the uniting axes may be in the same straight line, is inferior to the attraction ex erted between the adjacent north and south poles ; the molecules therefore unite as in figure 11, and constitute, by their union, a nucleus, each half of which acts independently ofthe other, though in connection with it, and thus produces a compound crystal. To this accident is owing the formation of compound crystals, in which composition is parallel to a primary face. Figure 13, plate 3, rep resent a crystal of arragonite thus formed, and figure 13a, a hori zontal section of the same. The planes e, e, truncate the acute lateral edges, as may be observed in figure 13b. It is obvious that the axes of the molecules, which are at right angles with those represented in figure 11, (and therefore since they point towards the observer, cannot be represented), may either present their similar poles in the same direction, or by the inversion of one molecule, opposite poles may point in the same direction, as is the case with the parallel axes in the figure. There are therefore the above two methods of forming compound crystals like the above. In the right rhombic prism, however, both these methods produce the same result as regards external form. But in oblique prisms the difference of structure is apparent. We here perceive that those accidents, to which molecules gov erned by axial attractions are necessarily liable, actually take place in nature ; and they afford strong presumptive evidence of the truth of the theory proposed to account for them. 192. In the formation of other compound crystals, two molecules unite in points of equilibrium of attraction between two poles, and thus give rise to twins of a second kind ; or in similar points be tween three poles, producing twins of a third kind. In the first case, the situation of the molecules is that given in fig. 12, plate 3, where they are retained in combination by the action of two north poles of one molecule, on the two south poles of the other. It is obvious that this is an instance of composition parallel to an edge. In the second case, the combination is due to the action of three"], [132, "116 CRYSTALLOGENY. poles of one molecule on three opposite of the other, and conse quently the composition is parallel to a plane on an angle. An example of the second kind of twins is given in fig. 14, pi. 3, which represents a crystal of pyroxene compounded parallel to the edge e. The figures of the crystals of feldspar, given on page 92, represent other forms resulting by this method : the similar poles of the vertical axes lie in opposite directions. The third kind of twins is exemplified in figs. 15 and 16, plate 3, the former a crystal of manganite, the latter a scalene dodecahedron of calcite. 193. Compound crystals composed of more than two individuals, arise from the occurrence of the above species of composition par allel to two or more faces, edges, or angles, simultaneously. Sev eral of these forms are represented in figs. 3, 5, 6, 8, plate 4. Fig. 1 represents a horizontal section of a crystal of white lead ore, four of whose lateral angles equal 117\u00b0 14', the obtuse angle of the primary rhombic prism, and two equal 125\u00b0 32', twice the acute angle of the same. In this instance, composition of the first kind has taken place parallel to two faces of the molecule A. Fig. 2 is a horizontal section of fig. 3, (another crystal of the same mineral), whose lateral angles are given in fig. 2. Composition of the first kind has here taken place between A and B, and subse quently, though almost consentaneously, C was added by the attrac tions between the poles represented in contact. In the preceding prism, (fig. 1), the union of B and C with A, was effected at the same instant, but here the addition of C was subsequent to the union of A and B, and from this has arisen the equal inclination of C to the other molecules. In compound crystals thus formed, each face of the prism is a primary plane. The same form may result from the union of A and B merely, without the addition of C, provided the prisms A and B have one of their acute lateral edges \u2014 the distant ones \u2014 trunca ted ; for the two upper edges in fig. 2 are parallel to the shorter diagonals of A and B, and therefore are also parallel to the trun cating plane just referred to. Fig. 2 under the species arragonite is an instance of this mode of formation ; two of the lateral planes of the prism are the planes e, and four are primary planes, M, and the crystal is composed of two individuals, the planes with the let ters accented below, belonging to one, and those without the accent, belonging to the other. A horizontal section of fig. 6, a crystal of Witherite, is exhibited in the outer lines of fig. 4. This prism differs from the preceding in the disposition of its primary angles, which are lettered a. b, c, d. The angles m and n, each equal twice the acute angle. To form the nucleus, A, B, and C, D, were first united, and then the com pound nuclei AB, CD, were joined by the action of the axes, which are here represented as nearly in contact. In fig. 7, a compound nucleus is represented, in which composi-"], [133, "117 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. tion of the first kind has been effected parallel to all the lateral faces of the molecule A. The truncation of the lateral edges of the four crystals, B, C, D, E, would give rise only to a cruciform crystal. But the action of the central molecule A, in conjunction, will cause an addition of particles parallel to A, and thus produce the other two rays. This is a horizontal section of fig. 8, a crystal of white lead ore. This arrangement is probably the origin of the stellate crystallizations of snow. 194. Compound crystals of the first kind are most common in rhombic prisms, and especially when the lateral angle is nearly 120\u00b0 ; and if exactly 120\u00b0, as is the fact with snow, simple crystals are seldom observed. Three molecules, whose lateral axes are inclined at an angle of 120\u00b0, form by their union a perfectly com pact group, similar to fig. 1, pi. 4, \u2014 except that all their axes are united in close contact ; and consequently their mutual action pro duces almost necessarily this compound structure. The union of six molecules by their acute angles, may also take place in the same manner, for 6x60\u00b0 equals 360\u00b0. Rhombic prisms, whose angles vary much from 120\u00b0, do not pre sent this kind of compound crystal. The following are the spe cies in which it is of frequent occurrence : Arragonite, (116\u00b0 10'), Strontianite, (117\u00b0 32'), Witherite, (118\u00b0 30'), White lead ore, (117\u00b0 14'), Vitreous Copper, (119\u00b0 35'), and Brittle Silver Ore, (115\u00b0 39'); and in all other species in which this mode of composition is not observed, the angle differs more from 120\u00b0 than in those enumerated. There is an exception to this remark in the case of white iron py rites, the lateral angles of whose rhombic prisms equal 106\u00b0 2'. But this exception illustrates well the general principle. These crystals are composed of five simple crystals, and the angle 73c 58', (the acute angle of the prism), varies but little from 72\u00b0, or one fifth of 360\u00b0. The occurrence of these forms, therefore corroborates the views I have attempted to explain. 195. Postnatal Compound Crystals. \u2014 Postnatal crystals are de scribed in \u00a7 158 to be of two kinds. 1. Doubly geniculated crystals, or those which have been appa rently bent subsequent to their formation. 2. Those which are composed of two distinct crystals, united by their similar parts. 196. Compound crystals of the former kind result from a rever sion of the original polarity in the molecules of the crystal, after the crystal has attained some size. The causes of this reversion are, probably, agents that are not unknown to us. Heat will have this effect on crystals of tourmaline and other minerals, their polar ity varying with the temperature. Electricity is equally an efficient agent in producing similar results. Let AB, (fig. 9, plate 4), represent a line of molecules in a crys tal in the act of formation, with its poles situated as there seen, the marked poles being north. The particle C is supposed to be"], [134, "118 CRYSTALLOGENY. on the point of obeying its axes of attraction, by uniting the pole n with m. At this moment there is a sudden reversion of the polarity of the crystal, as represented in A'B'. The molecule C now finds a repellant pole opposing it \u2014 since m and n are both north \u2014 and is immediately drawn around by the attraction between o, the nearest south, and m, and the union exhibited in A\"B\"C takes place, producing a geniculation in the crystal. The process, going on simultaneously at the other extremity of the crystal, causes another geniculation of the same. Fig. 1 1, pi. 4, is a section of a crystal, (a little resembling fig. 13, pi. 3), in which there is seen both a connatal and postnatal composition. The latter was ef fected as above described. Geniculation, according to the second kind of composition, may be illustrated by means of fig. 10; AB is again the crystal, C the next particle to be added. The molecules are those of a right square prism, which form is peculiarly subject to these accidents. In the figure, these molecules lie on one of their sides, and only one lateral axis is seen ; the other directing its north pole, s, towards the observer. The union of m and n is again prevented by a reversion of the polarity ; m therefore at tracts the nearest north pole, which is s. A revolution of 90\u00b0 must hence take place. But during this time, the unlike poles, t and u, (the vertical of the prism), are acting on one another, and tending towards a union ; consequently, the molecule will assume the inter mediate position seen in A\"B\"C, in which, contact has taken place at the point of equilibrium between two poles. Fig. 1, under ru tile, represents a crystal thus geniculated. A similar composition could not occur in the right rectangular prism ; for s could not be united to m, since they belong to unlike axes, and consequently, there must be a revolution of 180\u00b0, to bring r into union with m. We hence see why the right square prism is particularly subject to this kind of geniculation. An explanation of postnatal geniculation, according to the third kind of composition, flows readily from the above. An exam ple is given in fig. 12, pi. 4. The remaining kind of compound crystal is represented in fig. 11, of the species quartz. It is perfectly analogous to the ordinary union of two molecules ; for the crystals are united by their similar faces. They were, probably, brought originally into this parallel situation, by a process analogous to electrical induction, or the mu tual action of their attracting influences. FORMATION OF SECONDARY PLANES, AND ORIGIN OF CLEAVAGE.* 197. It has been abundantly explained that the same substance may crystallize under a variety of forms, all being modifications of * See for fuller details on this subject, an article by the author in the American Journal of Science, [2], iv, 364."], [135, "119 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. one type. A species may occur under the form of a cube, or a cube with truncated edges, or with bevelled edges, or with variously modified angles. If, then, a certain state of the attraction in a molecule will produce the primary cube, some variation from this state is necessary to produce another form, and a different variation for every different secondary form. 198. In view of the fixed simple ratios of mathematical exact ness, governing secondary planes, it is obvious that the variations which the attraction undergoes, are in some fixed ratio. And as similar parts of crystals are similarly modified, and similar parts are those similarly situated as regards like axes, the homologous parts of molecules experience the variation similarly and simulta neously. 199. The only exceptions to this last principle are the cases of hemihedrism, in which half the similar parts are modified alike ; and hence it follows that in some cases the parts of a molecule on two opposite sides of a pole may undergo a different amount of va riation of attraction ; but this takes place symmetrically, with reference to all the poles. 200. In the formation of a cube with truncated edges, the cube is not finished out on the edges. There is, therefore, when second ary planes are formed, a diminution of the force of attraction in the line of the primary axes, since these axes fail of completing the primary solid ; and this diminution, as above shown, is in some simple ratio. 201. In an enlarging cube, the mole cules are added in planes of increasing breadth, as in this way only would the form continue to be a cube. If we con sider the case, we find that the central molecule attracts a molecule by each of its poles, and also simultaneously the add ed molecules act by their lateral axes to complete the plane. We observe in the sectional view (through the centre) in figure 47, when A by its axes unites with four B's, the B's, simultaneously, while in the act of union, unite with B', B', B', B' ; and thus the square form is retained. This is a simple statement of the process. If now when the B's are uniting, their lateral axes do not act at the same time, then the forming cube will have the edges truncated as in fig. 5, pi. 1. To understand this we must study the steps in the process. Fig. 48 presents the same secondary planes as in fig. 5, without the primary faces. It is obvious that in the enlargement of such a secondary, when the summit molecule is annexed, its lateral axes do not act as they do when a cube is formed : but when another molecule is added beyond, then they act laterally. This may per haps be more clearly seen in the transverse section in fig. 49. When"], [136, "120 CRYSTALLOGENY A attracts B, B does not act laterally as in fig. 47 ; it does not so act until B attracts C, when a C is added either side ot B. So C acts laterally when a D is added to C, and not before. 202. Again in fig. 50, we have a section of another figure, (the same secondary as in fig. 10, pi. 1), showing the arrangement of mole cules in a solid, presenting such a section. Examining it, we per- ceive that when G is added to the extremity of the central axis, two molecules, G, G, are added on either side of F, and none late rally to G. This figure represents the formation of the secondary plane, having the ratio 1 : 2, as is evident from inspection, and fig. 48 or 49, another with the ratio 1:1. If the period of time occupied by the union of a molecule be represented by p, then when the lateral axes act only after the pe riod of time p, and then add a single row of molecules, the second ary plane is the truncating plane 1:1. For the plane having the ratio 1 : 2, in which two are added laterally to one terminally, or what is equivalent, one laterally for every half one terminally, the time would be \\p ; for the plane 1 : 3, the time would be $p. 203. To understand the origin of planes on an angle, we must again consider the actual cir cumstances. Fig. 51 (the same secondary as in fig. 2, pi. 1) will aid the mind in conceiving of it. Here, when the summit particle unites itself, it adds nothing laterally, as was the case also in fig. 49 ; when another unites beyond, then four particles are united, one by each lateral pole ; but these four add nothing, until still another particle is added to the summit. In this case there is an interval of time p, between the action of the ter-"], [137, "121 THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. minal and lateral axes, and another interval p, between the adding of the four molecules and the action by their lateral axes. And this is the difference between the plane truncating an angle, (fig. 2, plate 1), and another truncating an edge of a cube, (fig. 5, plate 1). This plane truncating an angle has the ratio 1:1:1. For a plane 1:2:2, the times will be each and for any plane 1 : m : n, the times will be and \u00a3p. It appears that the lateral axes act less speedily therefore for the truncating plane of an angle, than for that of an edge ; the centre of the former in a cube is 54\u00b0 44' from the centre of a face of the cube, and the centre of the latter from the same is 45\u00b0. 204. We have before observed, that the production of secondary forms depends on the fact, that the force of attraction in the axes of the molecules, when secondaries are produced, is less than that which is exerted when the primary prism or cube is formed. But we cannot suppose the whole force of attraction in a molecule to be different in different circumstances. No facts nor reasoning would sustain this Conclusion. We may admit that the attraction may be more concentrated in the primary axes, in some cases than in others. It is well known that the polar condition in bodies does not imply an addition of force, but simply an axial action or concentration of the force. This concentration or excited action may be induced by the condition of neighboring bodies or influ ences ; and different bodies should differ widely in their suscepti bility to it, as is evidently the fact. Now if the attraction is less concentrated in the primary axes, when a secondary plane forms, the interval of time above alluded to as characterizing the forma tion of different secondaries, will be longer or shorter according to the state of concentration in the primary axes. The more or less diffused state of the attraction is connected with the kind of secondary produced. But when we observe in a complex crystal the evenness of the faces, the neat regularity of the edges, and the perfection through out, even when many secondary planes are combined, it appears clear that such forms could not result from simply a generally dif fused state of the attraction, any more than a primary could be so produced. In each case there must be as many distinct poles as there are planes. When therefore the principal axes lose their concentration, this loss consists in a distribution of the force into subordinate axes intermediate between the primary axes. For a truncation of the edges of a cube, the intermediate axes would have their poles just at the middle point between every two poles of the primary axes ; for a truncation of the angles, the poles would be at the middle point between every three poles. We have remarked on the symmetrical arrangement of secondary planes in general, and this would follow from the necessary symmetrical ar rangement of such axes. Moreover the length of time p, will be greater the farther the secondary pole is situated from the primary 16"], [138, "122 CRYSTALLOGENY. poles. And this is true in fact. The pole for the octahedron is the most distant, being at the central point between three primary poles. The number of combined secondary forms may still seem mysterious. But a crystal, in its capacity as a unit, would neces sarily have a corresponding character in its different parts to that of the molecules of which it consists, and consequently the attrac tion exerted by the molecules in these different parts would corres pond, occasioning thus the secondary planes. The relative extent of the several different kinds of planes will depend piimarily on the relative force of action in the different sets of axes. These considerations lead us to conclude, that the diminution of attracting force in the primary axes, on which the formation of a secondary depends, consists in the partial action of this force along intermediate axes, symmetrically situated with reference to the primary axes ; and the greater or less amount of diminution, determines the kind of distribution* 205. The same crystalline form may have different cleavage. For example, cubes of galena have a cubical cleavage, while cubes of fluor spar have an octahedral cleavage, or yield octahedrons when cleaved. These different circumstances would result, provi ded that in one case (for galena) the three primary axes of the molecule were dominant, and in the other, the eight intermediate or octahedral axes. The arrangement of the molecules in each case would depend on the dominant axes, and so also would the direc tion of the cleavage. Hence, the- direction of cleavage may some times indicate in any species of matter which set of axes is dom inant, the primary or a secondary set. In the preceding paragraphs, after explaining the general polar action of crystallogenic or cohesive attraction, we have pointed out the modifications of condition this attraction undergoes, the simple ratios presented by these modifications, and their dependence on the formation of intermediate axes. Cohesive attraction, instead of being a constant force, as might be inferred from the ordinary definitions, appears therefore to be complex in its actions, yet sim ple in the general laws by which this complexity is produced. 206. Owing to some intrinsic or extrinsic influence, (the pres ence and condition of matter near by or commingled with the crys tallizing material), the primary axes may be sustained in an excited state. But if there is nothing to sustain or excite this concentration, and the action is quiet, or if bodies around induce it owing to their own condition, the attraction becomes more diffused, and second ary axes multiply.f All the crystals of a locality or region have usually the same form. * In the case of substances that very seldom crystallize or never, we have evidence that the polar forces are weak. t The theory above offered with regard to the origin of secondary planes, is near that presented in 1839 to the Royal Society, by Prof. Necker. How far they are identical, I cannot decide with certainty from the brief notice of his paper which I have seen in the"], [139, "THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 123 The constancy of certain forms in some species is evidence of the peculiar susceptibilities of the molecules of those substances. Thus the calc spar in the limestone of Lockport has the dog-tooth shape, the scalene dodecahedron ; that of Boonville, N. Y., occurs in short six-sided prisms. That of the Rossie lead region in com plex combinations of different secondary planes with the primary. These facts indicate, that the variations of attraction, produ cing secondary forms, depend often on surrounding bodies favor ing the concentration or diffusion of the attracting force ; and the causes often act in nature simultaneously over wide areas. 207. Cleavage. \u2014 The peculiarities of cleavage give us informa tion on another point, respecting cohesive or crystallogenic at traction. The facility of cleavage in prisms differs in the direction of unlike axes. Topaz cleaves easily parallel to the base of the prism, and hardly at all in other directions. This difference does not depend upon the relative strength of attraction in the unequal axes ; for it is often the reverse of this. Again, while some of the hard est substances have perfect cleavage, other soft species have none. If then this quality has no relation to the strength of the at traction which unites molecule to molecule, it must depend on some peculiarity in the manner in which this force acts. This force may act in two ways : \u2014 either continuously or intermittedly ; and the latter mode only, could produce the result in view. The action of force in nature appears to be generally intermittent. Al ternate action and comparative inaction, with corresponding results, are everywhere exemplified in organic growth ; and it is therefore no anomaly that it should be exemplified in the inorganic kingdom.* Phdosophical Magazine, vol. xiv, p. 216. M. Necker supposes that there is a tendency in crystals to take the spheroidal forms of their molecules ; that when the secondary axes are destroyed by different causes, simple crystals are produced. According to the view here presented, there is no tendency of this kind recognized ; the concentration of the pri mary axes producing simple forms is the ordinary condition of the molecules of some sub stances in solidification ; and by this concentration, however produced, the secondary axes lose their force. * The successive layers in wood, the periodical reproduction of leaves or flowers and of young in animals, and the seriate arrangement of parts in many plants and animals all illustrate intermittent growth. In some zoophytes the buds form in successive series of two, four, or six, or some other fixed nnmber ; in other cases opposite sides alternate in budding, or when there are several rows, the rows bud in succession ; and these are ex amples of intermittent action. The spiral arrangement of leaves in vegetation, as I have elsewhere observed, (Zooph, p. 89), is another illustration of intermittent growth ; for here the different sides of the growing plant (five, in many plants, and six in many others) bud successively, for the simple reason, of universal application, that reproduction produces temporary exhaustion, or, that force is exerted intermittedly. The pulsation of molecular force is also an example of intermitted action, and must he at the basis of the universal principle on this subject to which we have aDuded. The re ality of this pulsation we cannot doubt. The undulatory theory of light must be received as fully demonstrated ; and if it is an ether that pulsates, it is molecular force which makes it pulsate, and this implies pulsating action in molecular force itself. The attraction of cohesion is shown by cleavage to be intermittent in intensity ; we do not learn from it that there is any actual intermission of time in the exertion of the force, or a variation in rate of pulsation."], [140, "124 CRYSTALLOGENY. When, therefore, cleavage is produced in crystallization, the union of layers of molecules takes place by an intermitted action ; that is, with regular successive variations or pulses in the intensity of the force of attraction. This intermitted action, when reduced to the adding simply of single layers in succession, becomes contin uous. On these principles there might be every variety of this quality in nature, and there should be no necessary connection be tween cleavage and strength of attraction. We therefore infer that the action of cohesive attraction is often intermittent, pro ducing seriate results, (as exemplified in the cleavage of crystals), and the specific rate of intermittent action is different for unequal axes.* 208. In aggregated crystallizations, there is a mass of material entering the solid state together, and no opportunity exists for sin gle crystals to perfect themselves. While a liquid mass is cooling, whenever the temperature of solidification is reached, at number less points throughout the mass crystallization will begin ; and to gether, an aggregation of crowded crystals or grains is produced, with no external regularity of form ; in other words, the granular structure. The same will happen in a crystallizing solution, if the process goes on rapidly. When a solution is spread thinly over a large surface, minute crystalline points incrust the whole ; and if the solution be gradu ally supplied as crystallization goes on, it is obvious that the minute points may elongate into crowded prisms of fibres, producing a fibrous structure. Such a structure is common in narrow seams in rocks, and the fibres are usually elongated across the seam. 209. The concentric structure is another result depending on the rate of solidification connected often with the rate of chemical combination. In the first place, the nucleus is always a cluster of molecules, instead of a single one, as in a simple crystal. The structure sometimes commences around some foreign body as a centre, though the aggregation is often without any proper nucleus except that of the cluster of molecules that first solidified. The second principle, on which the concentric structure depends, is the tendency of a body to communicate its own condition to other bodies within its influence. This law \u2014 the law of equilibrium, and contact or catalysis in chemistry \u2014 is one of the universal laws of existence. According to it, either a collection of molecules enter ing the solid state, or any foreign body already solid, will tend to * Many crystals, as remarked on page 75, have parallel striations, which consist of alternations of two or more sets of planes. Thus cubes of pyrites very generally have their faces marked with stri\u00e6 which are oscillations between a plane replacing the edge, and either a face of the primary cube, or another plane of the same secondary. Some octahedrons of fluor spar have faces which consist of minute cubes. These facts, and they are common and well known, show a frequent intermittent mode of action in the different axes of molecules, (or a seeming strife between different sets) ; and such examples are well called an \" oscillatory combination\" of planes."], [141, "THEORETICAL CRYSTALLOGENY. 125 bring adjacent bodies into the same or an intermediate condition. If susceptible to this influence, the particles adjoining become as similated, and unite to the nucleus ; these again act upon others ad joining, and thus a spherical form is produced, as a result of suc cessive development.* 210. We have thus reviewed some of the various facts presented by matter, as it exists around us. Observation has proved more profitable than closet speculation in animal and vegetable Physiol ogy ; and so it will be with regard to the organizing force of the so-called inorganic kingdom. The fact that the attraction of mole cules is liable to modifications of condition, and especially the sim ple yet fixed relations between these modifications, nothing but a crystal could make known to us. Yet the principle is as wide as the universe in its application ; for we live in a universe of mole cules, and all the grandeur of physical nature is the result of mole cular forces. From the late rapid progress in science, we may be encouraged to hope that ere long this entrance to one of the innermost recesses of the works of nature will be thrown open, and that the qualities of atoms or molecules, their forms and peculiarities, will soon be fully understood. Its connection with the science of chemistry, and other physical sciences, renders it deserving of very minute experimental research. Beautifully and truly was it long since observed by Gulielmini, in his work on Crystallization \u2014 an author who, though afterwards forgotten, had a clearer insight into the nature of crystallization, than any of his cotemporaries, and many of his successors \u2014 p. 144 : \" Crystallisatio geometrizantis natur\u00e6 opus quoddam est, et sane mirabilissimum ; dignum ideo ut totis ingenii viribus totaque mentis content ione exquiratur, non quod spectet tantam am\u0153nitatem et voluptatem, qu\u00e6 mirabilium scientiam consequitur, verum etiam ob maximam in re physic a utilitatem ; videtur quippe Natura hie se prodere, et omni exuta velamine non qualis esse potest, sed qualis actu est sese pr\u00e6bere conspiciendam.\" * The concentric structure here explained is analogous in many respects to the circu lar and spherical forms in vegetation. The growing lichen extends itself circularly, owing to progressive assimilation or development. This proves no simdarity of nature between the organic forces and cohesive attraction ; it only shows that different forces act under a common law."], [142, "PART II. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. I. CHARACTERS DEPENDING ON LIGHT. 211. Light may be either reflected, transmitted, or emitted. The qualities of minerals thus produced are of six kinds : \u2014 1. Lustre; depending on the power and manner of reflecting light. 2. Color; depending on the kind of light reflected or trans mitted. 3. Diaphaneity ; depending on the power of transmitting nght- ,. \u2022 - 4. Refraction ; depending on the manner of transmitting light. 5. Polarization ; depending on the manner of transmitting or reflecting light, and due to the polar nature of force. 6. Phosphorescence ; depending on the power of emitting light. I. LUSTRE. 212. The lustre of minerals varies with the nature of their sur faces. A variation in the quantity of light reflected, produces different degrees of intensity of lustre ; a variation in the nature of the reflecting surface, produces different kinds of lustre. a. The kinds of lustre recognized are six. 1. Metallic: the lustre of metals. Imperfect metallic lustre is expressed by the term sub-metallic. 2. Vitreous : the lustre of broken glass. An imperfectly vit reous lustre is termed sub-vitreous. The vitreous and sub-vit reous lustres are the most common in the mineral kingdom. Quartz possesses the former in an eminent degree ; calcareous spar, often the latter. This lustre, in each case, approaches the lustre of broken glass of the color of the mineral. 3. Resinous : lustre of the yellow resins. Ex. opal, and some yellow varieties of zinc blende. 4. Pearly : like pearl. Ex. talc, native magnesia, stilbite, &c. When united with sub-metallic, the term metallic-pearly is used."], [143, "127 COLOR 5. Silky : like silk ; it is the result of a fibrous structure. Ex. fibrous carbonate of lime, fibrous gypsum. 6. Adamantine : the lustre of the diamond. When also sub metallic, it is termed metallic -adamantine. Ex. carbonate of lead, dark red silver ore. b. The degrees of intensity are denominated as follows : \u2014 1. Splendent : reflecting with brilliancy, and giving well defined images. Ex. Elba iron ore, tin ore. 2. Shining : producing an image by reflection, but not one well defined. Ex. celestine. 3. Glistening: affording a general reflection from the surface, but no image. Ex. talc, copper pyrites. 4. Glimmering : affording imperfect reflection, and apparently from points over the surface. Ex. flint, chalcedony. A mineral is said to be dull when there is a total absence of lus tre. Ex. chalk, the ochres, kaolin. These different degrees and kinds of lustre are often exhibited differently by unlike faces of the same crystal, but always similarly by like faces. The lateral faces of a right square prism may thus differ from a terminal, and in the right rectangular prism the lateral faces also may differ from one another. The surface of a cleavage plate in foliated minerals, very commonly differs in lustre from the sides, and in some cases the latter are vitreous, while the former is pearly. II. COLOR. 213. The external color of minerals often differs from the color of the powder, or that of a scratched surface. The latter, called the Streak, is the most constant character, since it seldom varies in the same species. The mineral species are liable to so many acci dental mixtures of foreign substances, that, in general, little reliance can be placed on the external color. The metals and the metallic oxyds are among those species which are the least subject to vari ation. The following eight colors have been selected as fundamental, to facilitate the employment of this character in the, description of minerals : White, Gray, Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, and Brown. a. Metallic Colors. 1. Copper-red: native copper. \u2014 2. Bronze-yellow: magnetic pyrites. \u2014 3. Brass-yellow : copper pyrites. \u2014 4. Gold-yellow. \u2014 5. Sil ver-white: native silver, less distinct in arsenical pyrites. \u2014 6. Tin white : mercury, cobaltine. \u2014 7. Lead-gray : galena, molybdena. \u2014 8. Steel-gray : nearly the color of fine grained steel on a recent fracture ; native platinum, and palladium."], [144, "128 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. b. Non-metallic Colors. A. White. 1.

Peculiarities in the Arrangement of Colors. Play of Colors. \u2014 An appearance of several prismatic colors in rapid succession on turning the mineral. This property belongs in perfection to the diamond ; it is also observed in precious opal, and is most brilliant by candle light. Change of Colors. \u2014 Each particular color appears to pervade a larger space than in the play of colors, and the succession produced by turning the mineral is less rapid ; Ex. Labrador feldspar. Opalescence. \u2014 A milky or pearly reflection from the interior of a specimen. Observed in some opal, and in cat's eye. Iridescence. \u2014 Presenting prismatic colors in the interior of a crys tal. Tarnish. \u2014 A metallic surface is tarnished, when its color differs from that obtained by fracture ; Ex. variegated copper ore. A sur face possesses the steel tarnish, when it presents the superficial blue color of tempered steel ; Ex. columbite. The tarnish is irised, when it exhibits fixed prismatic colors ; Ex. specular iron of Elba. The tarnish and iris colors of minerals are owing to a thin sur face film, proceeding from different sources, either from a change in the surface of the mineral, or foreign incrustation. Hausmann states that hydrated oxyd of iron (usually formed from pyrites) is one of the most common sources of it, and produces the colors^on anthracite and specular iron. Arsenic becomes irised through the action of hydrogen from the atmosphere : arsenical cobalt, nickel, and iron, by oxydation : galena probably, from the formation of 17"], [146, "130 physical properties of minerals. sulphate of lead at the surface : magnetic iron and some ferruginous silicates from a change in the oxyd of iron to a hydrate : pyrites, and probably also copper pyrites and variegated pyrites from the formation of a hydrate of iron: antimony glance and other anti mony ores from the formation of antimony ochre ; fahlerz and other arsenical ores probably from the oxydation of the arsenic. The irised colors may also proceed from a disengagement of car bonic acid or water, as in spathic iron and carbonate of manganese. Heat sometimes favors it, as in the case of steel. Dichroism, Pleochroism. \u2014 Some crystals, viewed by transmit ted light, present different colors in different directions. This property is termed pleochroism, (from the Greek tXeoj, full, and XP\u00b0\", color), or dichroism, (from Sig, two-fold, and x?m)< when the colors are different in two directions only. This property is exhibited only by crystals which have at least two kinds of axes ; the colors are the same in the direction of like axes, and often different in the direction of unlike axes. It exists in tourmaline, iolite, mica, chrysoberyl, &c. Iolite owes its name (dichroite) to this property. Mica is nearly opaque in one direction, while it is transparent in another ; it also presents different colors in these directions. III. diaphaneity. 214. The diaphaneity of a mineral is its capacity of transmit ting light. The following terms are adopted to express the differ ent degrees of this property. Transparent : when the outline of an object seen through the min eral is perfectly distinct. Gypsum, quartz. Subtransparent or semi-transparent : when objects are seen, but outlines are not distinct. Translucent : when light is transmitted, but objects are not seen. Carrara marble. Subtranslucent : when merely the edges transmit light, or are translucent. When no light is transmitted, the mineral is said to be opaque. This property occurs in every degree in the mineral kingdom, from a perfect opacity to a perfect transparency, and most minerals present, in their numerous varieties, nearly all the different shades. Few minerals, except the metals, are perfectly opaque. It is always similar in the direction of like axes of a crystal, and often dissim ilar in the direction of unlike axes. iv. refraction, polarization 215. A full account ofthe refraction and polarization of light belongs more especially to a treatise on optics, where the student will find the subject discussed at length. The remarks in this place are necessarily confined to a few simple explanations."], [147, "refraction. 131 a. Simple Refraction. \u2014 If we look into a cup obliquely, at such an angle that an object at its bottom is just concealed from view by its sides, on filling the cup with water this object will become visible. This is owing to a bending or refracting of the rays of light, by the water. This effect is termed refraction, and is pro- duced by all transparent bodies, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. The part of the ray AED, within the water, is nearer the perpendicular BC, than if it had proceeded in its original direction AE ; or, if we consider the ray as passing from the water into the air, the part AE, is farther from the same perpendicular than if it had proceeded in the original direction DE. We have therefore this important principle : Light, in passing from a rarer to a denser medium, is refracted towards the perpendicular ; if from a denser to a rarer, it is refracted feom the perpendicular. It has been proved by experiment, that at whatever angle we look at the surface of the water, there will be a constant ratio between AB and CD, provided the eye and the object are at the same distance, A and D, from E. That is, if AB is twice the length of CD, viewing it at one angle, it will be twice at every other angle, until the eye is perpendicular over the object D, when there is no refraction. But AB is the sine of the angle AEB, which is the angle of incidence, and CD is the sine of the angle CED, which is the angle of refraction. This principle may there fore be thus stated : The sine of the angle of incidence bears a constant ratio to the sine of the angle of refraction. This ratio is termed the index of refraction. In water, the ratio is as T335 to 1. 1-335 is therefore the index of refraction of water. 216. The following are the indices of refraction for the sub- stances enumerated : Tabasheer, 1*211 Carbonate of Strontian, 1*700 Ice, 1*308 Boracite, 1*701 Water, 1*335 Chrysoberyl, 1-760 Cryolite, 1*349 Feldspar (Adularia), 1*764 Fluor Spar, 1*436 Corundum\u2014 white, 1*768 Alum, 1*457 \" red, 1*779 Borax, 1*475 \" blue, 1*794 Gypsum, 1*525 Garnet, 1-815 Chalcedony, 1*553 Zircon, 1-961 Rock Salt, 1*557 Carbonate of Lead, 2*084 Quartz, 1*548 Native Sulphur, 2*115 Euclase, 1*642 Blende, 2*260 Calc Spar, 1*654 Diamond, 2*439\u20142*755 Arragonite, 1*693 Chromate of Lead, 2*500\u2014 2*974 There is some variation at times in the same species, and it often corresponds to a change of color."], [148, "132 physical properties of minerals. 217. Double Refraction. \u2014 Many crystalline substances give two images instead of' one, owing to double refraction. If a line be viewed through a transparent crystal of calc spar, it will appear double in every direction but one \u2014 that of the vertical axis of the rhombohedron. One image is seen by the ordinary refraction of light; the other, by an extraordinary refraction. If the same crystal is placed over a point, and turned around, one image will appear to revolve around the other. The direction in which there is no refraction is called the axis of double refraction, or neutral line, since in its direction the ordinary and extraordinary rays co incide. Double refraction increases in passing from this direction to one at right angles with it. In some instances the extraordinary ray is situated between the ordinary ray and a perpendicular to the surface of the crystal ; and in others it is exterior to this ray. The former possess a greater index of refraction for the extraordinary than for the ordi nary ray, and the axis is called a positive axis of double refraction. In the latter, the reverse is the case, and the axis is a negative axis. Calc spar has a negative axis, quartz, a positive. The following are the indices for a few substances : Ordinary ray. Extraordinary roy. Calc spar (neg.) 1-654 1'483 Arragonite (neg.) 1-693 1-535 Quartz (pos.) 1-548 1-558 Euclase (pos.) 1-642 1-663 Zircon, tin ore, rutile, apophyllite, gothite, brucite, tungsten, and ice are examples of a. positive axis; and idocrase, scapolite, meio nite, tourmaline, corundum, emerald, apatite, nepheline, dioptase, alum, phosphate of lead, arsenate and molybdate of lead, cinnabar, anatase, of a negative axis. 218. When there are two axes of double refraction, both rays, as shown by Fresnel, are due to extraordinary refraction. The two axes are in a vertical plane in right prisms, but not so in ob lique prisms. The angle between these axes has been determined for many minerals, and has served to distinguish species. The following are some examples : Carbonate of Strontian, 6\u00b0 56' Topaz (Brazilian), 49 \u2014 50\u00b0 Mica \u2014 different kinds 6\u00b0, 14\u00b0, 25\u00b0, Strontianite, 60\u00b0 30o, 31\u00b0, 32\u00b0, 34\u00b0, 37\u00b0, 45\u00b0 Comptonite, 66\u00b0 6' Talc, 7\u00b0 24' Gypsum, 60\u00b0 Carbonate of Lead, 17\u00b0 30' Iolite, 62\u00b0 16' Arragonite, 18\u00b0 18' Topaz (Aberdeenshire), 65\u00b0 Chrysoberyl, 27\u00b0 51' Kyanite, 81\u00b0 48' Heavy Spar, 37\u00b0 42' Epidote, 84\u00b0 19' Stilbite, 41\u00b0 42' Chrysolite, 87\u00b0 56' Anhydrite, 44\u00b0 41' Copperas, 90\u00b0 The relation of double refraction to crystalline form was first pointed out by Brewster. He showed that monometric solids which have the three axes equal to one another have no double refraction. But all other forms exhibit this property ; and if the"], [149, "133 polarization. horizontal diameters are equal, as in the dimetric and hexagonal systems, there is but one axis ; if unequal, two axes, as in the trimetric -and oblique systems. 219. Polarization. \u2014 The polarization of light is intimately con nected with double refraction, this polarity being exhibited by the extraordinary ray, which is said to be a polarized ray. When such a ray is viewed by means of another doubly refracting crystal or crystalline plate, (called from this use of it, an analyzing plate), the ray of light becomes alternately visible and invisible, as the latter plate is revolved. If the polarized light be made to pass through a doubly refracting crystal, then on viewing it in the man ner stated, rings of prismatic colors are developed, and on revolv ing the analyzing plate, the colored rings and intervening dark rings successively change places. If crystalline plates having one axis Calcite. Nitre. of double refraction be viewed in the direction of the axis, the rings are circles, and they are crossed by a dark or light cross. Figure 53 shows the position of the colored rings and cross in calc spar, and figure 54 the same at intervals of 90\u00b0 in the revolution of the plate. With a crystal having two axes of double refraction, there are two series of elliptical rings, as in figures 55 and 56, the latter alternating with the former in the revolution of the plate. 220. Light is polarized also by other means. If a ray of light be reflected from a plate of glass at a certain angle it is polarized ; and so each reflecting substance has its own angle for polarizing light. In glass the angle between the ray and a perpendicular to the glass, is 56\u00b0 45', or between the ray and the glass, 33\u00b0 15', but varying somewhat for the kind of glass. In fluor spar the latter angle is 34\u00b0 51', in quartz 33\u00b0 2', calc spar 31\u00b0 9', diamond 21\u00b0 59'. Again, if light is made to pass through a series of thin transparent plates of glass or mineral substance, it is polarized, the angle of polarization differing as the number of plates is varied. 221. Polarization has the same relation to crystalline form as double refraction. Some monometric crystals give the rings of colors due to polarization ; but the rings have a symmetrical arrange ment like the faces of the crystals, and have been shown by Biot to be due not to the molecular character of the crystal, but to its"], [150, "134 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. cleavage or lamellar structure, the lamell\u00e6 polarizing as a series of thin plates, in the manner just mentioned. A peculiar polari zing structure in apophyllite, not according with the general law for dimetric crystals, is explained by him in this manner. V. PHOSPHORESCENCE. 222. Phosphorescence, or the emission of light by minerals, may be produced in different ways : by friction, by heat, or by exposure to light. By friction. Light is readily evolved from quartz or white su gar, by the friction of one piece against another, and merely the rapid motion of a feather will elicit it from some specimens of sul phuret of zinc. Friction, however, evolves light from a few only of the mineral species. By heat. Fluor spar is highly phosphorescent at the temperature of 300\u00b0 F. Different varieties give off light of different colors ; the chlorophane variety, an emerald green light ; others purple, blue, and reddish tints. This phosphorescence may be observed in a dark place, by subjecting the pulverized mineral to a heat below redness. Some varieties of white limestone or marble emit a yel low light. By the application of heat, minerals lose their phosphorescent properties. But on passing electricity through the calcined mine ral, a more or less vivid light is produced at the time of the dis charge, and subsequently the specimen when heated will often emit light, as before. The light is usually of the same color as previous to calcination, but occasionally is quite different. The following table contains some of the results of T. J. Pearsall's* investigations : the second column gives the color of the natural phosphorescence ; the third, the color induced by electric discharges.

The light induced by electricity is in general less intense than that of the unaltered mineral, but is much increased by a repeti tion of the electric discharges, and in some varieties of fluor it may be nearly or quite restored to its former brilliancy. It has also been found that some varieties of fluor, and some specimens of diamond, calc spar, and apatite, which are not naturally phosphorescent, may * Jour, of Royal Institution, i, 77, 267."], [151, "135 ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM. be rendered so by means of electricity. A dozen discharges through a non-phosphorescing statuary marble in powder, caused it to emit a yellow light when subsequently heated. Electricity will also in crease the natural intensity of the phosphorescent light. Acquired phosphorescence is not equally permanent, however, with the natural. On 21 days of exposure to the light, according to Mr. Pearsall, many specimens lost partially, and some entirely, this property ; in others, the color of the light was changed ; and gene rally to purple and orange tints. If laid away in a dark room, they retained this property for a much longer period of time. Mr. Pearsall also states that some colored fluors that had been rendered white by calcination, received a bluish or reddish tint, by means of repeated electrical discharges. Light of the sun. The only substance in which an exposure to the light of the sun produces very apparent phosphorescence, is the diamond, and some specimens seem to be destitute of this power. This property is most striking after exposure to the blue rays of the spectrum, while in the red rays it rapidly loses its phospho rescence. II. ELECTRICITY\u2014 MAGNETISM. 223. The electric and magnetic characters of crystals bear but slightly upon the Science of Mineralogy, although of high interest to the student of physics. Our observations are therefore brief, notwithstanding the wide extent and importance of the subject. 224. Frictional Electricity . \u2014 The development of electricity by friction, is a familiar fact. There is no line of distinction among minerals, dividing them into positively electric and negatively elec- tric ; for both kinds of electricity may be presented by different va- rieties of the same species, and by the same variety in different states. The gems are positively electric only when polished : the diamond alone among them exhibits positive electricity, whether polished or not. The time of retaining electric excitement is widely different in different species, and topaz is remarkable for continuing excited many hours. 225. Pyro-electricity. \u2014 On heating crystals of some minerals, they become electric with opposite polarity in opposite parts. This property is called pyro-electricity . Tourmaline is one of the spe- cies thus affected : boracite is another. The polarity continues as long as the temperature is increasing, and becomes reversed when it commences to decline ; and when the heat is stationary it disap- pears. This subject has been investigated by the Abbe Haiiy, Can- ton, Becquerel, Brewster, Hankel, Riess, and Rose."], [152, "136 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. Rose and Riess* name one of the poles the analogue electric pole, and the other the antilogue electric pole. The former becomes posi tive while the crystal is heating and negative while cooling; and the latter the reverse, being negative while heating and positive while cooling. Becquerel says of the tourmaline :f \"At 30\u00b0 C, elec trical polarity was sensible; it continued unchang\u00b0ed to 150\u00b0, as long as the temperature continued to rise ; if stationary an instant, the polarity disappeared, but shortly manifested itself reversed, when the temperature commenced to decline. If but one end of the crystal was heated, the crystal was unpolarized, and when two sides were unequally heated, each acquired an electrical state inde pendent of the other.\" In tourmaline, the extremities of the prism are dissimilarly modified, and that end which presents the greatest number of planes is the antilogue pole ; or if the number of planes is the same, the secondary rhombohedrons of the antilogue pole have (one or more of them) longer vertical axes than those of the analogue pole. In figure 3, under tourmaline, the upper extremity is the antilogue pole {positive under increasing heat) and the other is the analogue pole.

Brewster has added calc spar, yellow beryl, celestine, white lead ore, red and blue fluor spar, diamond, orpiment, analcime, amethyst, idocrase, mellite ?, native sulphur, garnet, and iolite. But the more recent investigations of Riess and Rose have sailed to detect this property in any but the species first enumerated. 226. Pyro-electricity is of two kinds :* \u2014 either terminally polar, or centrally polar. In the former, the extremities are opposite poles. In the latter, two sides of a prism are of the same name, and the opposite pole to each is intermediate between the two. The examples of the first kind, are tourmaline, electric cala mine and scolecite, uniaxial ; axinite, biaxial; boracite and rho dizite with four axes. Electric calamine, like tourmaline, has the sharper extremity the antilogue end, and the more flattened the analogue. Compound crystals from Altenberg have both ends analogue, and the middle, between the twins, antilogue electric. As in tourmaline, the pyro electric axis corresponds with the vertical axis of the prism. Boracite, which crystallizes in cubes with the opposite solid angles differently modified, has four pyro-electric axes, correspond ing to the four octahedral axes. In fig. 1 of this species, the plane a is the antilogue pole, and the unmodified angle the analogue pole ; and, generally, the antilogue pole is most largely modified by sec ondary planes, or has larger facets. Rhodizite resembles boracite in its pyro-electricity. The species in which pyro-electricity of the second kind has been observed, are prelinite and topaz. If figure 59 represent a tabular crys tal of prehnite, the poles will be situated as marked, the analogue being central and the an alogue at either extremity of the shorter diago nal of the rhombic prism. Topaz has in a simi lar manner a central analogue pole and an anti logue at either extremity of the shorter diagonal. In some instances there is a separate set of simi- lar poles near one or the other angle, as in the following figure ; this has arisen probably from the com pound nature of the crystal. The particular character of the axes in sphene, heavy spar, and rock crystal has not been made out. Two specimens of heavy spar were heated to 180\u00b0 R., and positive electricity was observed, but not negative, and it was hence inferred that the pyro-electricity was centrally polar, as in topaz. Quartz was found * Riess and Rose. IS"], [154, "138 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. to be pyro-electric in a single small crystal six lines long and two thick, after failing in six others, five of which were an inch in length and one half an inch thick. Great caution is required in the trial with this mineral, as the crystals are so readily rendered electric by friction. 227. Magnetism \u2014 .All substances are either magnetic or diamag netic. The magnetic take a longitudinal position between the poles of a strong magnet, the diamagnetic a transverse position. In the former division are iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, cerium, palladi um, platinum, osmium ; and among the latter, bismuth, antimony, tin, mercury, gold, arsenic, zinc, lead. Magnetism is most strongly exhibited by iron and its compounds, and specimens of magnetic iron often have polarity. Titanic iron and specular iron ore are also at times magnetipolar. The or dinary mode of testing whether a mineral is magnetic or not, is to bring it near a pole of a delicately suspended magnetic needle, and observe whether it causes it to vibrate ; and another mode is to apply a strong magnet to the mineral in powder. These are suf ficient for the mineralogist, without all the delicacy required for the purposes of physical science. Delesse has experimented extensively upon the magnetic force of minerals, and has deter mined the relative amount for numerous species. Calling this force for Styrian steel 100000, the following are some of his results: \u2014 Native platina,' 2173 \u2014 3'047 Magnetic iron ore, 1500 \u2014 65'00 Franklinite from the United States, 1-033 Chromic iron, 0-136 \u2014 0065 Spinel, (pleonaste), from Monzoni, Tyrol, 0078 Titanic iron, (rhombohedral), often magnetipolar, 6'764 Specular iron \u2014 sometimes magnetipolar, 0-14 \u2014 2-35 Graphite, 0015\u20140-040 Spathic iron \u2014 (spherosiderite the highest), 0092 \u2014 0-287 Iron pyrites, 0-039\u20140057 Vivianite, 0-027 \u2014 0'075 Columhite of Bodenmais andHaddam, 0151 Pyrochlore, 0010 Quartz. \u2014 It is diamagnetic, but many varieties are magnetic.

Crystallo-magnetic action. \u2014 The magnetic polarity thus far alluded to belongs to the mass, and has no relation to crystalline form. There is also a kind of polarity directly related to the crys talline or optical axes of minerals, as has been recently developed by Faraday and Plucker. Plucker observes that a crystal of kya-"], [155, "HEAT 139 nite, suspended horizontally, points very well to the north, by the magnetic power of the earth only, and is a true compass needle, from which even the declination may be obtained ; and the line of direction is the line of the optical axes. Other crystals, which are called negative, take a transverse or equatorial position. A bare allusion to the subject is all that is proper in this place.* III. HEAT. 229. There are two sets of phenomena observed with crystals under the action of heat, in addition to phosphorescence and pyro electric qualities. (a.) Crystals expand unequally in the direction of unequal axes, and alike in the direction of like axes. The monometric solids change equally in all directions ; but those of other systems have direc tions of least and greatest dilatation ; and these correspond with axial lines in the crystals. Any dimetric or hexagonal crystal di lates alike in corresponding parts about the vertical axis ; for the lateral axes of the crystal are equal. But the trimetric and clino metric forms have three unequal axes, and dilate unequally along these axes. Crystals are not only enlarged ; their interfacial angles are also varied. This change in the angles takes place in all crys talline forms, excepting those ofthe monometric system. Mitscher lich found that in calc spar there was a diminution of 8' 37\" in the angle of the rhombohedron, on passing from 32\u00b0 to 212\u00b0 F., the form thus approaching that of a cube, as the temperature in creased. Dolomite, in the same range of temperature, diminished 4' 46\"; and in arragonite, between 63\u00b0 and 212\u00b0 F., the angle of the prism increased 2' 46\". In some rhombohedrons, as of calc spar, the vertical axis is lengthened, (and the lateral shortened), while in others, like quartz, the reverse is true. The variation is such either way that the double refraction is diminished with the in crease of heat ; for calc spar possesses negative double refraction, and quartz, positive. According to Fresnel, the same is true of gypsum. The dilatation for calc spar, according to experiment, is 0-001961. Dr. Kopp has shown that in the carbonates of lime, magnesia, iron, manganese, and zinc, which are nearly the same in their crys tals, the vertical axis (axis a) is shorter the greater the atomic vol ume. And since heat diminishes the density, and therefore neces sarily increases the volume, the axis a should be lengthened by an increase of temperature, as is actually the case. He has deter mined by calculation, that the change of angle for 180\u00b0 F. (from 32\u00b0 to 212\u00b0) should be 7' 37\", which is but 57\" less than Mitscher lich's observations \u2014 a near coincidence, when we consider the difficulties of measuring exactly the dilatation and change of angles. * See farther, Faraday on Bismuth, Phil. Mag. [3], xxxiv, 75 and Am. J. Sci. [2], vii, 425 ; and Plucker's recent results, Phil. Mag. [3], xxxiv, 460, and Am. J. Sci. [2], viii, 430."], [156, "140 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. (b.) 230. Crystals conduct heat according to a similar law to that of their expansion. This subject has lately been investigated by Senarmont. This author states that, from a point in a tesseral or monometric crystal, heat is conducted equally in all directions, so that the isothermal surfaces are spherical surfaces, concentric about the point. In crystals of the dimetric and hexagonal systems, (whose molecules are ellipsoids of revolution), the isothermal sur faces are the surfaces of concentric ellipsoids of revolution. In the other systems, (in which the molecules are ellipsoids not of revolution), the isothermal surfaces are surfaces of concentric ellip soids not of revolution. The correspondence with the phenomena of light is striking. Yet there are some points of difference. Quartz and calc spar differ, in the former being optically attractive, and the latter optic ally repulsive. Yet both have a prolate thermic ellipsoid. Oblate thermic ellipsoids have, however, been found in idocrase, specular iron, and corundum ; and the most prolate occur in attractive crystals. The heat rays appear thence to correspond to light rays which lie beyond the extreme red. In calc spar, the proportion of the axes of the ellipsoid is 112 ; in quartz, 1312; in beryl, I'll ; in idocrase, 113; in rutile, 127. In arragonite, the proportion of the horizontal axes is 122; in bournonite, for a perpendicu lar ellipse, parallel with the longer diagonal, 131, and parallel with the shorter diagonal, 1'29. In feldspar, augite, and gypsum, for the three principal elliptical sections, \u2014 1, vertical to the axis of sym metry, (a thermal axis), and 2 and 3, parallel to the axis of sym metry and one of the other two thermal axes : Feldspar.

The melting of the wax took place in circular or elliptical areas, according to the material, with great precision and uniformity for the same plate. 231. Savart has obtained a correspondence to the phenomena of light and heat in the unequal elasticity of crystals along une qual axes.* 232. M. Wiedemann.f moreover, has recently investigated the figures produced on different faces of crystals, by electricity acting on a light powder, or some kinds of oil ; and he finds the same general correspondence between circular and elliptical areas and the axes, as was distinguished for heat by Senarmont. * Rechercbes sur l'ctasticite du cristal de roche, etc, Ann Ch. PhyB. [1], zL 118. i Poggendorf 's Anoalen, lxxvi, 1849."], [157, "141 SPECIFIC GRAVITY. IV. SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 233. The specific gravity of a mineral is its weight compared with that ot another substance of equal volume, whose gravity is taken at unity. If a cubic inch of any mineral weighs twice as much as a cubic inch of water, (water being the unit), its specific gravity is 2, if three times as much, its specific gravity is 3, &c. In the case of solids or liquids, this comparison is usually made with water ; but when the substance is a gas, atmospheric air is assumed as the unit. It results from the nature of a fluid, that the weight lost by a solid immersed in water, is equal to the weight of an equal volume of water. The determination of specific gravity is, therefore, a very simple process. We ascertain the weight out of water by weighing it in the usual manner ; we then determine the weight in water ; and the loss by immersion, or the difference of the two weights, is the weight of an equal volume of water : that is, if a mineral weighs 120 grains out of water, but 90 on emersion, it has lost 30 grains, which is the weight of a volume of water equal to that of the mineral. The mineral, consequently, weighs in this instance 4 times as much as the water ; for 4x30 grains equals 120 grains, which is the weight of the mineral. The rule for the process is, therefore, \u2014 Divide the weight out of water by the difference of weights obtained out and in water. The water employed for this purpose should be distilled, to free it from all foreign substances. Since the density of water varies with its temperature, a particular temperature has been selected for these experiments, in order to obtain uniform results : 60\u00b0 F. is the most convenient, and has been generally adopted. But the temperature of the maximum density of water, 395\u00b0 F., has been recommended as preferable. If a pair of scales is used for obtaining the weight, they should be exceedingly delicate, when perfect accuracy is required. For original investigations they should turn with the 1000th of a grain. The weights must be selected with care, and should vary from the twentieth of a grain to 120 grains. To weigh the mineral immersed in water, it may be attached to the scales by a single fibre of raw silk or a fine hair, and thus let down into ajar of water, care being taken that the scales be kept perfectly dry. The attachment ofthe fibre of silk to the scales may be made by means of a small hook attached to the lower part of one scale. For the ordinary investi gations of the mineralogist, in the determination of species, it will be found most convenient, if the scales are not provided with this hook, to make a small hole through the centre of one scale, and through it attach a horse hair permanently to the scale. By tying a slipping knot in the horse hair, the minerals under investigation"], [158, "142 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. may be attached and detached without difficulty, owing to the elas ticity of the hair. To insure accuracy, those specimens should be selected which are perfectly free from foreign substances, and contain no vacuities, even under a magnifying glass. If vacuities exist, they may usually be removed by coarsely pulverizing the mineral. An impalpable powder is apt to swim on the surface, although heavier than water. 234. A better and more simple process than the above, and one available for porous as well as compact minerals, is performed with a light glass bottle, capable of holding exactly a thousand grains (or any known weight) of distilled water. Pour out a few drops of water from the bottle after filling it and then weigh it. Then add the powdered mineral till the water is again to the trim, and reweigh it. The difference in the two weights, divided by the loss of the water poured out, is the specific gravity sought. The weight of the glass bottle itself is here supposed to be balanced by an equiv alent weight in the other scale. Rose has recently observed that fine pulverization of a mineral, and even of a metal, gives uniformly a higher specific gravity than is obtained from the solid mass, and he considers the result therefore as involving a slight error. The mineralogist is so seldom required to take the specific gravity of liquids or gases, that an explanation of the different methods employed is unnecessary. V. CHARACTERS DEPENDING ON COHESION. 235. These characters are of three kinds: \u2014 1. Hardness; 2. State of Aggregation ; 3. Fracture. I. HARDNESS 236. A harder body is distinguished from a softer, either by at tempting to scratch the one with the other, or by trying each with a file. Each of these methods is used by the mineralogist in deter mining the hardness of the species, though the latter is in most cases to be preferred. Both methods should be employed when practicable. Certain varieties of some minerals give a low hard ness under the file, owing either to impurities or imperfect aggre gation of the particles, whilst they scratch a harder species,\u2014show ing that the particles are hard, although loosely aggregated. Chiastolite, spinel, and sapphire are common examples of this fact. When the mineral is too hard to be impressed by a file, the pecu liarity of the grating sound will suffice to the practised ear. To give a definite character to the results obtained with respect"], [159, "143 HARDNESS to the hardness of minerals, the distinguished German mineralogist Mohs introduced a scale of hardness. In older works on the science, the very indefinite terms hard, soft, tender, &c, were em ployed to express the degrees of hardness. Afterwards, minerals were described as harder or softer than glass, or than one another. Consequently, the standards were almost as numerous as the mineral species, and no information was conveyed to the person unacquaint ed with the species with which comparison was made : or if ac quainted with the species, since many minerals vary somewhat in their hardness, the statement was still indefinite, unless the partic ular variety was noted. The confusion and incorrectness thus introduced into the science, have been removed by the selection of a few minerals of common occurrence as standards of comparison. Mohs's scale consists of ten minerals, which gradually increase in hardness from 1 to 10. The intervals between 2 and 3, and 5 and 6, are larger than the others. Breithaupt has therefore introduced another degree of hardness between each of the above, and thus his scale consists of twelve minerals. Mohs's scale is as follows : 1. Talc ; common laminated light green variety. 2. Gypsum ; a crystallized variety. 3. Calcareous Spar ; transparent variety. 4. Fluor Spar ; crystalline variety. 5. Apatite ; transparent variety. 5-5. Scapolite ; crystalline variety. 6. Feldspar ; white cleavable variety. 7. Quartz ; transparent. 8. Topaz ; transparent. 9. Sapphire ; cleavable varieties. 10. Diamond. If the file abrades the mineral under trial with the same ease as No. 4, and produces an equal depth of abrasion with the same force, its hardness is said to be 4. If with more facility' than 4, but less than 5, the hardness may be 4j or 4j, written in decimals 425, 4'5. Several successive trials should be made to obtain certain results. The use of the file is acquired with very little experience ; usu- ally a single trial is sufficient. Care must be taken to apply the file to edges of equal obtuseness. That part, also, ofthe specimen should be selected which has not been altered by exposure, and has the highest degree of transparency and compactness of struc- ture. The pressure for determination should be rather heavy, and the file should be passed three or four times over the specimen. Rock salt is usually given in the scale of hardness for No. 2 ; but crystals are nearer 3. Many species present different degrees of hardness on dissimilar faces ; as an example of which, we men- tion kyanite and mica. This is confined to the inequilateral pri- mary forms, and like the similar difference of color, lustre, &c, finds a ready explanation in the theory of their formation ; unlike faces are the result of the action of unlike axes."], [160, "144 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. II. STATE OF AGGREGATION. 237. Solid minerals may be either brittle, sectile, malleable, flex ible, or elastic. Fluids are either gaseous or liquid. 1. Brittle ; when parts of a mineral separate in powder or grains on attempting to cut it ; kerolite, calc spar. 2. Sectile ; when pieces may be cut off with a knife with out falling to powder, but still the mineral pulverizes under a hammer. This character is intermediate between brittle and mal leable ; gypsum. 3. Malleable ; when slices may be cut off and these slices flatten out under a hammer ; native gold, native silver. 4. Flexible ; when the mineral will bend, and remain bent after the bending force is removed ; talc. 5. Elastic ; when after being bent, it will spring back to its orig inal position ; mica. A liquid is said to be viscous, when, on pouring it, the drops lengthen and appear ropy ; petroleum. III. FRACTURE. 238. The natural fracture of crystalline minerals has already been noticed under cleavage. The fracture of amorphous miner als varies in the form and kind of surface produced. 1. Conchoidal ; when a mineral breaks with curved concavi ties, more or less deep. It is so called from the resemblance of the concavity to the valve of a shell, from concha, a shell ; flint. 2. Even ; when the surface of fracture is nearly or quite flat. 3. Uneven ; when the surface of fracture is rough, with numer ous small elevations and depressions. 4. Hackly ; when the elevations are sharp or jagged ; broken iron. VI. TASTE. 239. Taste belongs only to soluble minerals. The different kinds of taste adopted for reference are as follows : 1. Astringent ; the taste of vitriol. 2. Sweetish astringent ; taste of alum. 3. Saline ; taste of common salt. 4. Alkaline ; taste of soda. 5. Cooling ; taste of saltpeter. 6. Bitter; taste of epsom salts. 7. Sour ; taste of sulphuric acid."], [161, "145 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. VII. ODOR. 240. Excepting a few gaseous and soluble species, minerals in the dry unchanged state do not give off odor. By friction, mois tening with the breath, and the elimination of some volatile ingre dient by heat or acids, odors are sometimes obtained which are thus designated : 1. Alliaceous ; the odor of garlic. Friction of arsenical iron elicits this odor ; it may also be obtained from any of the arsenical ores or salts, by means of heat. 2. Horseradish odor ; the odor of decaying horseradish. This odor is strongly perceived when the ores of selenium are heated. 3. Sulphureous ; friction will elicit this odor from pyrites and heat from many sulphurets. 4. Bituminous ; the odor of bitumen. 5. Fetid; the odor of sulphuretted hydrogen or rotten eggs. It is elicited by friction from some varieties of quartz and limestone. 6. Argillaceous ; the odor of moistened clay. It is obtained from serpentine and some allied minerals, after moistening them with the breath ; others, as pyrargillite, afford it when heated. PART III. CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. I. COMPOSITION OF MINERALS. 1. General Remarks on the Constitution of Minerals. 241. The mineral species are either the uncombined elements in a native state, or compounds of the elements with one another. The number of elements, as at present recognized, is sixty-two, forty-nine of which are metals. 242. The following table contains their names, with the abbre viations by which they are represented, and their atomic weights. In the catalogue here given, we have included also the more com mon compounds of the elements with oxygen and sulphur, with their atomic weights ; and following these, the percentage propor tion of oxygen and sulphur in each. The dots indicate atoms of oxygen ; and the dashed letter, a double atom of the substance so expressed ; thus 3Pe means 2 of Iron to 3 of Oxygen. This table contains the most recent results of chemists, and is much altered from that by Berzelius. 19"], [162, "TABLE OF ATOMIC WEIGHTS. 146 Chromium.

As the use of the table in deducing formulas involves the fre quent multiplication of the oxygen percentage, their multiples by the digits 1 to 9 are given, for the compounds of most common oc currence, at the foot of the two preceding pages.* 243. The modes of combination and uses of chemical language are explained in chemical treatises, to which reference should be made by the student. A few brief illustrations are here added. By atomic weights is understood the combining proportions of the elements. For ex ample, when iron and oxygen combine, they unite in the proportion of 350 of iron to 100 of oxygen, or in some simple multiple of this ratio. The protoxyd contains one part or atom of each, and has therefore the atomic weight 450 ; the peroxyd contains 2 of iron to 3 of oxygen, and therefore has the atomic weight 1000, (2x350=700, and 700+300=1000). To ascertain the percent age of oxygen in this oxyd, we have 300 of oxygen in 1000 parts ; hence if 1000 parts contain 300, what will 100 parts contain : therefore dividing 300x100 by 1000 gives the oxygen percentage. Hence too if we multiply the percentage of oxygen by the atomic weight of the oxyd, we obtain as a result, after dividing by 100, the oxygen amount in the compound. For alumina, 46*74x641*8 the amount of oxygen; and in this way the correct ness of the oxygen percentage may be verified. 244. The mode of deducing chemical formulas may be illustra ted by two or three examples. 1. We have an analysis of Red Silver Ore as follows : Silver 58-949, antimony 22846, and sulphur 16609 per cent. It is desired to ascertain the relative number of atoms of each element in the compound. This number must depend on the weights of the atoms, as compared with the quantity of each, for the less the weight, the greater the number of atoms. The rule conse quently is, \u2014 Divide the percentage of each element by the atomic weight of the same ; as, 58949 by 1350, the atomic weight of silver. (See preceding table). This process gives the relation, 0043:0014: 0083; and dividing each by the smallest, to simplify it, it becomes * The student may find some aid in reading German labels, or consulting analyses, from the following list of significations of a few German words : \u2014 Blei, Lead.

The formula 3Ag+lSb+6S, or Ag3 Sb S6, expresses this relation. 2. An analysis of Feldspar gives in 100 parts, Silica 6420, Alumina 1840, Potash 1695. From the above table we find that 100 of silica contain 51 96 of oxygen ; consequently if 100 give 5196, the amount in 6420 parts will be found by multiplying 5196 by 64-20, and dividing by 100. So in 100 parts of alumina the oxygen is 46'74 ; hence the oxygen in 18 40 parts of alumina will equal, 18'40*46'74. In this way we ascertain that 6420 of silica contain 3335 of oxygen, ) (12 1840 of alumina \" 860 \" V \u00b0r 3 _ \u201e r. , I by the smallest, 1 1695 of potash \" 287 \" ) * (1 Hence the amount of oxygen in the potash, alumina, and silica, is as 1 : 3 : 12. Now as each atom of silica contains 3 of oxygen, 12 atoms of oxygen correspond to 4 of silica : so also 3 of oxygen for the alumina correspond for a like reason to 1 of alumina, and 1 of oxygen for the potash to 1 atom of potash. The compound there fore contains 4 parts of silica to 1 of alumina and 1 of potash. The next step in the usual method, is to determine how these constituents are combined ; how much ofthe silica with the potash, and how much with the alumina. Reference is made to the possi bility or probability of certain compounds, which Chemistry alone can teach ; but aid is found in the principle, that the number of atoms of oxygen in each acid and base is usually some simple multiple, the one of the other. If in the above compound, 1 of silica be united with 1 of potash, the ratio alluded to is 1 to 3 ; and if the alumina be combined with the Remaining 3 atoms of silica, the same ratio holds. This is the mode of combination commonly adopted ; it is expressed in the following formula, the dots, as ex plained, indicating the oxygen : KSi+fflSi3. The index 3 expresses the number of atoms of silica : had the 3 been written as a prefix, thus \u2014 3S1 Si, it would have meant 3 atoms of a compound of silica and alumina. 3. In the same manner we find that Yenite contains 3 of lime, 6 of protoxyd of iron, 2 of peroxyd of iron, 4 of silica. 3 Ca 6 Fe 2 \u00a5e 4 Si Apportioning the silica to the several bases, 1 atom to the lime, 2 to the protoxyd of iron, and 1 to the peroxyd, it gives the formula Ca3Si+2f,esSi+Pe2Si, in which the simple ratio between the oxygen of the bases and the oxygen of the silica is well illustrated. But lime and protoxyd of"], [166, "150 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. iron are isomorphous, and are therefore often linked together in the formula, as one may replace the other. Adding these terms gives 3 atoms of the two, to 3 of silica ; the formula then becomes 3 (Ca, Fe)3 Si+Pe3 Si\u2014 or 3 fi3 Si+f e> Si, ft being used as a general expression for the different isomorphous bases included within the brackets. This mode of stating a formula in general terms by the use of R is often employed. In linking together isomorphous constituents as above, the sum of like con stituents is first obtained ; next, if there is a common divisor, the results are to be divided by this divisor ; and then the formula written out. Thus, Ou and Pb being isomorphous \u2014 (3 \u20acu S+Sb S3)+2 (3 Pb S+Sb S3)^3 (\u20acu, Pb) S+Sb S3. 4. In the first example above, the sulphur is usually supposed to be combined both with the silver and the antimony, making the mineral a compound of sulphuret of antimony and sulphuret of silver. The sulphuret of antimony in such compounds contains 3 atoms of sulphur ; this leaves 3 atoms of sulphur for the 3 atoms of silver. The formula is therefore (using the mark ( i ) for an atom of sulphur), i hi i in 3 Ag+Sb, or, under another form, Ag3 Sb. 245. To deduce the percentage atomic relations from a formula, the process above described is reversed. For example : for feldspar, we have 4 of silica, 1 of alumina, 1 of potash. In the preceding table the atomic weight of silica is 57731, and 4 times this, is 230924. Setting this down and the atomic weight of alumina and potash below it, and adding, we have, 4 of Silica, 2309-24 1 of Alumina, 641-80 1 of Potash, 588-86 Total, 3539-90 or the atomic weight of the compound. Now if this amount (35399) of feldspar contains 2309-24 of silica, what will 100 parts contain ? Hence we divide the atomic weight of each constituent in succession by the sum of the whole, and this gives the percentage relation for each. 246. Isomorphism \u2014 Dimorphism and Trimorphism. \u2014 In the early stages of mineralogical and chemical science, identity of crystalline form was supposed to indicate an identity of chemical composition. As facts multiplied, the truth of this law was doubted, and in 1817, its uncertainty was well illustrated by Beudant in an article tending to prove the superiority of crystallographic charac ters for the distinction of mineral species. The law, however, by which the variations in the composition of the same species were governed, was not fully understood till 1819, when Mitscherlich brought out the fact that certain substances may replace one an other in the composition of compounds, without varying the crystal line form. This property he called Isomorphism, from itfoj, equal,"], [167, "COMPOSITION OF MINERALS. 151 and fM\u00a3<pi, form ; and those bases that admitted of mutual substitu tion, were termed isomorphous. By referring to the analyses of pyroxene or garnet, a remarkable disagreement will be observed between the several varieties of each, arising from the isomorphous nature of magnesia, lime, and protoxyd of iron. In some speci mens one of these bases is replaced wholly by both or one of the others ; and olten all three are found combined, and sometimes pro toxyd of manganese is also added. The carbonates of lime, magnesia, iron, manganese, and zinc have a common rhombohedral form, the angle R : R of which varies from 105\u00b0 in carbonate of lime to 107\u00b0 40' in carbonate of zinc. Again the sulphate of lime, (anhydrous), of baryta, strontia, lead, are isomorphous, the form being trimetric, and M : M=respectively 100\u00b0 8', 101\u00b0 40', 104\u00b0, 103\u00b0 43'. The angles, as observed, are only approximately identical, and the term plesiomorphism has therefore been proposed, yet it is hardly a necessary substitute, and has not been adopted. 247. Again, according to another principle, the same chemical compound may present two distinct unrelated forms. Thus car bonate of lime crystallizes in rhombohedrons, (p. 205), and also in trimetric forms, and when the latter, it is called arragonite, (p. 208). The principle here involved is termed dimorphism, from di$, twice, and \\i-ogyi),form. In titanic acid we have an example of three dis tinct forms for one chemical compound, one called rutile, another brookite, another anatase, (pp. 387-389), a case of what has been named trimorphism. Bromlite and barytocalcite (p. 198) are chem ically identical, yet the former is trimetric and the latter monoclinic. Moreover, bromlite (Ca, Ba) C is isomorphous with arragonite, CaC, and as the latter is the same compound with calcite, this kind of compound, Be, is trimorphous, (R standing for Ca, Ba, and the allied substances). The following examples illustrate the variety of forms that may belong to different compounds. ItC\u2014 1, rhombohedral, (calcite); 2, trimetric, (arragonite); 3, monoclinic, (bromlite). FeS3 \u2014 1, monometric, (common pyrites) ; 2, trimetric, (white iron pyrites). Ti \u2014 1 and 2, dimetric, (rutile and anatase); 3, trimetric, (brookite). Feldspar \u2014 1, monoclinic, (feldspar) ; 2, triclinic, (albite) ; and 3, (since leucite is the same compound with andesine), monometric. Garnet \u2014 1, monometric, (garnet); 2, monoclinic, (allanite, in part); 3, hexagonal, (hexagonal mica). An exhibition of the various cases of isomorphism and dimorphism or trimorphism will be found in the chemical classification at the close of this volume. 248. The physical characters vary with the form. In arragonite H=35 \u2014 4, G=292\u2014 294. In calcite, H=3, G=252 \u2014 2'7. Again in rutile G=418 \u2014 429; in anatase G=385\u2014 393 ; in brookite G=415. In the feldspars the monometric form has the lowest specific gravity, the monoclinic the next lowest, and the triclinic the highest, and the reverse is true of their atomic volumes."], [168, "152 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. 249. Two substances may be both isomorphous and correspond ingly dimorphous, and they are then said to be isodimorphous. Thus, titanic acid takes on dimetric and trimetric forms ; and its isomorph, oxyd of tin, has corresponding forms. 250. Isomorphism in compounds always follows isomorphism in the elements of which they consist ; and these isomorphous com pounds consist usually of the isomorphous elements in the same proportions, \u2014 that is, they are homologous compounds. Thus in one group, they are peroxyds ; in a second, protoxyds ; and so with other cases. 251. A proper classification of the elements exhibits their iso morphous relations and that of their homologous compounds, and it also classes together, on the ground just stated, those elements that are alike in their modes of combination. The following is such a classification, as nearly as we can now ascertain : 1. Oxygen, sulphur, selenium ; \u2014 fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine. 2. Carbon, boron, silicon. 3. Nitrogen ; phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth ; tellurium, vanadium ; osmium, iridium. 4. Titanium, tin ; \u2014 columbium, niobium, pelopium; \u2014 tungsten, molybdenum ; \u2014 uranium. 5. a. Cerium, lanthanum, didymium, yttrium ; glucinum ; zir conium, norium ; aluminium, chromium, iron, manganese, cobalt, nickel ; \u2014 zinc, magnesium, calcium, strontium, baryum, lead. b. Copper, mercury, silver, sodium, potassium, lithium. c. Gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium. d. Hydrogen. The peroxyds of cerium, lanthanum, zirconium, aluminium, chro mium, iron, and manganese, mutually replace one another ; and so the protoxyds ; \u2014 in other words, like compounds of each group are isomorphous. 252. Prof. G. Rose has shown that iridium and osmium, and probably also palladium, are isomorphous with antimony, arsenic and tellurium. They all assume rhombohedral forms ; in Osmium, R : R=84\u00b0 52'. Tellurium, R : R=86\u00b0 57'. Iridium, \" 84\u00b0 52'. Antimony, \" 87\u00b0 35'. Arsenic, \" 85\u00b0 04'. Bismuth, \" 87\u00b0 40'. Palladium, undetermined. 253. The isomorphism of \u20acu (or Cu2) with Pb has been recently admitted, and evidence of its correctness has been brought forward by the distinguished chemist just mentioned. So also gu and Ag, are isomorphous. Hence cuproplumbite, whose formula \u20acu S+2 Pb S=(\u20acu, Pb)3 S3=(\u20acu, Pb) S, is analogous to galena (Pb S) in composition as well as crystalliza tion. Copper glance, \u20acus, and stromeyerite, (\u20acu, Ag) s, are isomor phous. By doubling the atomic weight of copper, eu then becomes Cu, and the seeming anomaly is removed."], [169, "COMPOSITION OF MINERALS. 153 254. It has been assumed that sulphur and arsenic are iso morphous. But as Rose observes, the view is not supported by a similarity of crystallization in the elements, nor by an analogy in their compounds. There are wide discrepancies in the angles, when the forms are of the same system. For example, in the rhombic prism of marcasite, (Fe Sa), the angle M : M=106\u00b0 36' ; in that of leucopyrite, (Fe As2), the same angle is 122\u00b0 26'; and in mispickel, (Fe As2+Fe S2, which Frankenheim has written Fe (As, S)2), this angle is 111\u00b0 53'. These three compounds are probably therefore distinct types. 255. The isomorphism of substances, according to Dr. H. Kopp, is connected with an equality of atomic volume. He ascertained the atomic volumes of many acknowledged isomorphous or rather ple siomorphous compounds, (by dividing the atomic weight by the spe cific gravity,) and found a conformity among substances so re lated. For example, for the carbonates of zinc and magnesia, mes itine, carbonates of iron and manganese, dolomite, and calc spar, the atomic volumes are as in the following table : Atomic volume. Axis a. Angle. Carbonate of zinc, 175-33 0807 107\u00b0 40' Carbonate of magnesia, 181-25 0-812 107\u00b0 25' Mesitine, 18626 0815 107\u00b0 14' Carbonate of iron, 188-50 0819 107\u00b0 Carbonate of manganese, 202'29 0-822 106\u00b0 61' Dolomite, 20236 0833 106\u00b0 15' Calc spar, 23120 0854 105\u00b0 05' This table, which contains also the length of the vertical axis, (axis a), and the angle of the rhombohedron of each of these min erals, illustrates the interesting principle which he next deduces, that the axis increases, in this series, or the angle diminishes, as the at omic volume increases.* 256. Isomorphism has been supposed to be confined to like or homologous compounds. Yet the discrepancies in composition among the varieties of epidote, scapolite, and some other species, have shown that there are exceptions not harmonizing with the received law. Hermann has recognized these cases of isomorph ism under the new term heteromerism \u2014 which term, as all unlike compounds are heteromerous, is of unmeaning application here, and should be written out in full, heteromerous isomorphism. G. Rose has pointed out a few more striking cases of isomorph ism among unlike compounds. After showing that bournonite and dark red silver ore have analogous chemical formulas, (see be yond), he remarks that the first occurs in rhombic prisms, the other in rhombohedral forms. He then points out the close approxima tion in form between bournonite, arragonite, and nitrate of potash, * Dr. Kopp also deduces a formula for calculating the volume from the length of the axis, and finds it to give results agreeing very nearly with the above. These principles are illustrated by numerous examples, in an article in the L.

Another example is in the case of the rhombohedral metals, whose angles are given on page 152, and the rhombohedral peroxyds, specular iron, titanic iron, corundum, (pure alumina), in which the angle R : R is between 85\u00b0 55' and 86\u00b0 6', the last being the angle of corundum, and 86\u00b0 that of specular iron. 258. But these, as the author finds, are but a few among the many groups. It appears, in fact, that isomorphism may be inde pendent of any relation in composition. The following are some of the groups distinguished : \u2014 1. Chrysoberyl (Be Si, or, with the old atomic weight, Se Si6), \u2014 Chrysolite ( (Slg,Fe)3 Si), \u2014 Serpentine (2Mg3Si3+3lVIgfi3),\u2014 VUlarsite (4 (fe, $rg)3Si+8fl), \u2014 Picrosmine (2Mg3Si3 + 3fl),\u2014 Epsom Salt (MgS+7fl). 2.

The isomorphism of chrysolite and serpentine with other re lated magnesian species is now well known. We observe also that a brachydiagonal prism in chrysolite has the angle 80\u00b0 53', and a corresponding one in chrysoberyl 119\u00b0 46'. The tangents of half of these angles are nearly as 1 : 2 ; and a vertical prism of the former has the angle 49\u00b0 50', and one of chrysoberyl 70\u00b0 40', giving the relation of 1 to 1 J. The crystallographic axes of these species, as they have been given, are as follows : abc Chrysoberyl, 0-58 \u2022 l : 0.465 Chrysolite, 11733 : 1 \u2022 093"], [171, "155 COMPOSITION OF MINERALS. in which, the 1st and 3d terms of chrysolite are double the same in chrysoberyl. The relation is farther seen in the following angles of a rhombic octahedron in the above mentioned species : \u2014 Chrysolite, 139\u00b0 55' 85\u00b0 15' 108\u00b0 31' Serpentine, 139\u00b0 34' 88\u00b0 26' 105\u00b0 26' Villarsite, 139\u00b0 45' 86\u00b0 56' 106\u00b0 52' Chrysoberyl, 139\u00b0 63' 86\u00b0 16' In picrosmine a brachydiagonal prism has the angle 117\u00b0 49', near 119\u00b0 46' of chrysoberyl, and a vertical prism the angle 53\u00b0 08', near 49\u00b0 50' of chrysolite. Epsom salt has the same axes as chrysolite, except that for the assumed fundamental form the vertical axis is approximately one half less. The numbers given are, 0-5703 : 1 : 09089. For the other groups we pass on without remark in this place. 259. The author also finds that the law of equality of volume, or of a simple ratio, holds for these anomalous cases, as well as for those to which it was applied by Kopp. We do not obtain a simple ratio, in most instances, if we compare the aggregate atomic volume of the mineral, as has sometimes been done ; but if this sum is divided by the number of atoms of elements, the relations are at once apparent. We thus obtain \u2014 1. Chrysoberyl 37'15, serpentine 44-9, chrysolite 4P6, villarsite 41-65, epsom salt 44, picrosmine (which is less closely related in angle) 46'68. 2.

Yet the range of numbers is wide. The rhombohedral species increase in atomic volume about 0075 for a diminution of 1' of angle ; and the trimetric 0-1 for an increase of 1' of angle. This subject has various applications, which cannot be properly included in this place. 260. Cause of Dimorphism. \u2014 Dimorphism has been shown by Mitscherlich, Rose, and others, to result in many instances from the different temperatures attending crystallization. When a right rhombic prism of sulphate of zinc is heated to 126\u00b0 F., certain points in its surface become opaque, and from these points bunches of crystals shoot forth, in the interior of the specimen ; and in a short time the whole is converted into an aggregate of these crys tals diverging from several centres on the surface of the original crystal. These small crystals, thus formed at 126\u00b0 F., are oblique rhombic prisms ; and the same form may be obtained by evapo rating a solution, at this temperature, or above it. Sulphur crys tallizes from fusion in oblique rhombic prisms, while the common form obtained by evaporation is a rhombic octahedron. Rose has obtained crystals of arragonite by evaporating a solution of car bonate of lime to dryness by means of a water bath, and crystals of calc spar by permitting the solution to evaporate in an open vessel at the ordinary temperature. The crystals of arragonite were minute six-sided prisms and double six-sided pyramids, (fig. 124, plate 2). They change to rhombohedrons of calc spar if left moist ; but if washed and dried at once, they remain permanent. By exposing arragonite to a low temperature, the crystal falls to pieces, in consequence of the change to calc spar which takes place ; or if the prisms hold together, they consist, after the change, of an aggregate of minute particles of calc spar.* Artificial ar ragonite has been observed in the interior of a copper boiler used to supply hot water for household purposes at Port Eliot, Cornwall. The crystals were minute six-sided prisms, and were attached at base to the surface supporting them.f Breithaupt has described a carbonate of lime from a greenstone rock near Zwickau, which consists of alternations of layers of arragonite and calc spar ; and he suggests that one may be a winter, the other a summer deposit. J * Rose, Loud, and Ed. Phil. Mag. [3], xii, 465. t Lond. and Ed. Phil. Mag. [3], xii, 330\u20141841. JPogg. Ii, 506\u20141840."], [173, "CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. 157 261. Dimorphism depends therefore on the circumstances at tending crystallization. Temperature appears to be the main cause : yet it is possible that the nature of the solvent, or the pres ence of some accidental ingredient in the solution, or the electrical state of the support, may have some effect in changing the mole cules ; but in general the only effect of these causes is to produce secondary planes. Rose did not succeed in obtaining arragonite crystals by mixing a strontian salt with the solution of lime, and shows that the strontia in arragonite has nothing to do with pro ducing the rhombic form. II. CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. 262. The chemical properties of minerals are ascertained (1) by the action of acids and other re-agents ; 2, by heat, concentrated by means of the blowpipe, assisted by various chemical re-agents; 3, by chemical analysis. This subject, especially the last division of it, falls into the department of chemistry. We here mention only the more ordinary chemical and blowpipe tests. I. CHEMICAL TESTS. 263. The simplest use of acids consists in the detection of a volatile ingredient expelled by them. A carbonate is thus distin guished. The acids ordinarily employed are the sulphuric, muri atic, and nitric, and they are commonly diluted with one-half water. Carbonate of lime, when dropped into either of these acids diluted, gives off bubbles of gas, an effect called effervescence. Other carbonates require an addition of heat. Before making this trial it should be observed that the mineral is quite pure, as a car bonate in seams or fissures might give a fallacious result. Another gas of a pungent odor is obtained when common salt is subjected to the action of sulphuric acid ; and another of acrid character when certain ores of copper are acted on by nitric acid. 264. In such examinations with acids it is important to observe the odor of the escaping gas ; also, whether very suffocating and disagreeable, or merely pungent ; also, its color, and the color of the solution. In many instances, solution is obtained without effer vescence ; and often a mineral is but partly soluble, and the insolu ble part is thrown down in the state of a powder ; frequently, it may be insoluble in cold, but soluble in hot acid. The fumes given off will sometimes redden paper tinged blue with litmus or cabbage liquor, owing to their acid character ; others will blacken paper that is charged with acetate of lead, because of the sulphur they contain. Another kind of vapor expelled by strong sulphuric acid will corrode glass placed over it, an effect due to the presence of fluorine."], [174, "158 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. 265. Another effect of the action of acids is the formation of a jelly. To accomplish this, the finely pulverized mineral is thrown into a strong acid, and a gentle heat applied. After a short time, as the solution cools, it gelatinizes. In a few instances, a jelly may be formed with cold acid. By heating the mineral, this prop erty is often destroyed ; but occasionally it takes place, with equal facility, before and after heating. These facts will often assist in distinguishing minerals. The minerals that gelatinize in this man ner are silicates, mostly those of the zeolite family ; it arises from the separation of the silica in a gelatinous state. 266. The following are some of the more common chemical re actions : a. Carbonates. \u2014 Effervesce with dilute muriatic acid, yielding a colorless inodorous gas, which gives a white precipitate when passed into lime water. The fumes redden moist litmus paper and heat restores the blue color. b. Sulphates. \u2014 No effervescence with acids. When in solution, they give with barytic water a white precipitate not soluble in water or the muriatic, nitric, or sulphuric acids. c. Nitrates. \u2014 With strong sulphuric acid give white corrosive vapors of nitric acid, and on heating, reddish vapors of nitrous acid. With heated muriatic acid yield an acid that dissolves gold, becoming at the same time yellow. d. Phosphates. \u2014 Dissolve in muriatic, nitric, or sulphuric acid. Well dried and heated in a glass tube with potassium, give a phos phuret, which in water produces phosphuretted hydrogen, a gas which inflames on coming into the atmosphere, and has a garlic odor. e. Chlorids. \u2014 In solution afford with nitrate of silver a white curdy precipitate, which darkens and becomes violet on exposure, is not soluble in water, hardly so in acids, and wholly in ammonia. Any chlorid heated with sulphuric acid yields muriatic acid, which acts as just stated with nitrate of silver ; or heated with oxyd of manganese, affords chlorine. f. Silicates. \u2014 Fuse in a silver crucible with three or four times their weight of caustic potassa or soda, yielding a silicate soluble in water, which gives with an acid a precipitate (silica) that dries to a white, insoluble powder, harsh to the touch. Many silicates gelatinize with acids, as already stated. g. .Salts of Lime. \u2014 In solution, even if dilute, give with oxalic acid or oxalate of ammonia a white precipitate insoluble in water or acetic acid, but very soluble in either of the acids. h. Compounds of Iron. Protoxyd Salts. Peroxyd Salts. Precipitate with potash or ( greenish white, becoming green ) brown, of hydrated per- soda, j and then yellow on exposure. j oxyd of iron. Precipitate with ferrocy- ( white, becoming blue on es- I \u201e . , , ania of potassium, ) posure. \\ P\u2122sian blue. Precipitate with nutgalls ( none; but becoming bluish black / , ,, , , , or tannic acid, \\ on exposure. J deep blue black."], [175, "CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. 159 i. Compounds of Manganese. \u2014 The oxyds heated with muriatic acid give chlorine. Heated with potash or its nitrate, the salts give manganate of potassa, which affords a green color with water, and a rose tint with dilute acids that is destroyed by sulphurous acid or organic matters. k. Compounds of Copper. \u2014 Mostly soluble in nitric acid. Me tallic iron in the solution becomes coated with metallic copper ; potash or soda produces a blue precipitate, which becomes black on boiling ; ammonia a green, which is soluble in an excess of ammo nia and becomes fine blue. 7. Compounds of Zinc. \u2014 The sulphate gives a white precipitate with potash, soluble in an excess of this re-agent ; no precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen. Acetate of zinc affords an abundant white precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen. m. Compounds of Lead. \u2014 Dissolved in nitric acid, give with sulphuretted hydrogen a black precipitate, insoluble in excess ; with iodid of potassium, or chromate of potash, a yellow precipitate. The acetate yields with metallic zinc, metallic lead in shining plates or scales. n. Compounds of Tin. \u2014 Dissolved in muriatic acid, form a chlorid, which with chlorid of gold give a purple color, or if strong, a brown precipitate. o. Compounds of Mercury. \u2014 The protosalts in solution give with potash a black precipitate insoluble in excess ; with sulphu retted hydrogen a black insoluble precipitate ; with metallic copper, they yield metallic mercury, which is dissipated by heat. With muriatic acid afford a white precipitate or calomel. p. Compounds of Silver. \u2014 Dissolved in nitric acid, a chlorid or muriatic acid throws down a dense, white, curdy chlorid of silver, which blackens on exposure, and is soluble in ammonia. With metallic copper it affords metallic silver. q. Gold. \u2014 Dissolves in nitromuriatic acid, (aqua regia), but not in either ofthe acids unmixed. The solution gives, with protochlorid of tin, a purple precipitate, and with sulphate of iron, metallic gold. r. Platinum. \u2014 Dissolves in nitromuriatic acid, and not in either of the acids unmixed ; the solution gives with muriate of ammonia a yellow precipitate, which heated in a platinum crucible gives metallic platinum in powder. II. ACTION WITH THE BLOWPIPE. 267. The first of the following figures represents the simplest kind of blowpipe. It is merely a bent, tapering tube of brass, from seven to ten inches long, with a minute aperture at its smaller end. It is used to concentrate to a point the flame of a lamp or candle ; and this is done by blowing through it while the smaller end is just within the flame."], [176, "160 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS After blowing awhile, the moisture of the breath often condenses in the tube ; and to receive this moisture, and prevent its pass ing out at the beak, the chamber at o 61 62 63 (see figs. 62, 63) is usually added. The air-chamber in fig. 63 is a cylinder, into which the tube abc is screwed at c, and the smaller piece, des, at d. The point ef screws off, and is made of pla tinum in order that it may be cleaned when necessary, by immersion in an acid. When the blowpipe is made of brass, it is usual to have an ivory mouthpiece, as it is more agreeable in the mouth. Silver is the best material ; and the point, at all events, should be of pla tinum. Wollaston contrived a conve nient pocket instrument on the plan of a common pencil case. The instrument represented in fig. 63, has a screw at b. On unscrewing it, the part be may be inserted at a into the part ab, and the two screwed to gether again. In this way it is as portable as Wollaston's, and has the advantage of being more easily made tight with the screw, and is less liable to get out of order. Operations with the blowpipe often require an unintermitted heat for a considerable length of time, and always longer than a single breath of the operator. It is therefore requisite that breathing and blowing should go on together. This may be difficult at first, but the necessary skill or tact is soon acquired. Let the learner at tempt first to breathe through his nostrils with his cheeks inflated and mouth closed. This accomplished, if the blowpipe is now put to the mouth, he will find no difficulty in continuing his respirations while the muscles of the inflated cheeks are throwing their con tained air through the blowpipe. When the air is nearly exhausted, the mouth may again be filled through the nose without intermitting the process of blowing. The blowpipe flame consists of two cones ; an inner of a blue color, and an outer, yellow. The heat is most intense just beyond the extremity of the blue flame. The inner flame is called the reduction flame, and the outer the oxydation flame. A mineral re duced to the metallic state by the inner, may often be oxydized, or combined with oxygen, in the outer flame, where it is in contact with the atmosphere. For oxydation, the beak of the blowpipe should have a large aperture, and the wick of the lamp should also be large : the heat usually requisite is that of incipient redness. The best flame is that of a lamp with a large wick, fed by olive oil. A common candle with a large wick will answer for most of the purposes of the mineralogist, and is most conveniently carried"], [177, "161 BLOWPIPE EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. about. When used, the wick should be bent in the direction of the flame. 268. To support the mineral in the flame, either charcoal or pla tinum forceps or wire may be used. The charcoal should be well burnt but firm ; that from pine wood is the best, as it burns with least ashes. The reaction of the carbon of the coal aids in reducing or decomposing many mineral species. A convenient kind of forceps is represented in the annexed figure. It is made of steel, with platinum points, ab, and pins at p, p, for opening the forceps. The mineral kyanite, and also mica, are some times used for a support when more convenient means are not at hand. To test the presence of water or a volatile ingredient, the mine ral may be supported near one end of a test tube, which may be 3 or 4 inches long, and the bore little larger than a quill. The flame is concentrated on the exterior of the tube beneath the assays and the volatilized substance usually condenses in the upper part ofthe tube. By inserting into the upper end of the tube a strip of litmus or other test paper, it is ascertained whether the fumes are acid or not, the color of the paper, if so, changing to red. 269. Many minerals remain unaltered before the blowpipe, unless some substance be added to aid in the fusion or reduction. These substances are called _/Zw.ces \u201e\u2022 those in common use are borax, car bonate of soda, and salt of phosphorus or microcosmic salt* Care should be taken to obtain the fluxes pure, and for this purpose it is well to dissolve or recrystallize the borax ; and the soda should be tested for sulphuric acid, as any adulteration with this acid will give the glass obtained with silica, a brown or reddish color. These fluxes should be powdered and added to the mineral, and the whole assay should not exceed the size of a small pea. One fourth this size is better than larger. The soda should be added in small suc cessive doses ; this flux is often absorbed by the charcoal, but gen erally reappears when the heat is sufficiently raised. Besides the fluxes mentioned, other tests are sometimes used, of which the following are the most important : a. Nitrate of cobalt in solution, for distinguishing alumina and magnesia. The solution should be pure, free from alkali and slight ly concentrated. Berzelius recommends having a bit of platinum wire in the cork stopper, in order to take out a drop upon it when required for use. * This salt, a phosphate of soda and ammonia, may be made by dissolving 16 parts of sal-ammoniac in a small quantity of boiling water, and afterwards adding 100 parts of crystallized phosphate of soda, boiling gently the whole, and then setting it away to cooL The salt of phosphorus is deposited in small crystals. If the heat be too great during ebullition, decomposition takes place. 21"], [178, "162 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. b. Boracic acid and iron wire, used in testing for phosphoric acid. c. Tin-foil, for fusing with certain peroxyds of metals to reduce them to protoxyds. The assay, previously heated in the reducing flame, should be touched with the end of the tin-foil ; a very minute quantity of a metallic oxyd is often thus detected. d. Gypsum and fluor, used as tests of one another. When two parts of the former rendered anhydrous by heating, and one of the latter, are mingled and heated, they fuse to a clear glass, which is a milk-white enamel on cooling. The globule from fluor and heavy spar is transparent when cold ; and that with sulphate of strontian is more or less frothy. e. Saltpetre is employed in discovering manganese, bringing out the characteristic amethystine color when the quantity of this metal is too small to color glass without this reagent. The heated globule is touched with the point of a crystal, just at the moment of sus pending the blast. The melted mass swells, foams, and either be comes immediately colored, or is so soon upon cooling. f. Anhydrous bisulphate of potash, used for detecting lithia. It is kept in a coarse powder in a phial well secured from moisture. g. Oxalate of nickel, or nitrate of nickel, used to detect potash. The nickel must be quite free from cobalt ; it may be tested by treating it with borax, with which it should give a brown, not a blue bead. The effects of the blowpipe are various. Some minerals are volatilized wholly or in part, others fuse at a low temperature ; while others melt only on the edges, (then called subfusible), or are wholly infusible. Kobell has proposed the following scale for denoting in figures the degree of fusibility : 1. Gray antimony . \u2014 2. Natrolite. \u2014 3. Cinnamon Stone, (var. of garnet). \u2014 4. Black Hornblende. \u2014 5. Feldspar. \u2014 6. Chondrodite. The fusibility, when equal to that of natrolite, is designated by 2 ; or if like hornblende, by 4, and so on. The fluxes are also often required in obtaining the pure metals from the metallic ores. 270. The following are some of the reactions with the fluxes :* 1. Silica, Silicates. \u2014 Silica dissolves with effervescence in soda. The silicates are decomposed by salt of phosphorus, and the silica is set free, often remaining as a silica skeleton in the globule. Co lumbic acid, on the contrary, forms a clear glass with salt of phos phorus. 2. Potassa, Soda, Lithia. \u2014 Soda gives an intensely yellow color to the flame, even when in combination ; yet this color may be other wise produced. Potash salts often give a violet tinge, and a lithia salt a red color to the flame ; but the presence of soda vitiates the test * On this subject consult Berzelius on the blowpipe, of which an excellent translation has been published at Boston, by Mr. J. D. Whitney, pp. 237, 8vo. 1845. This work has been consulted in preparing the table here given."], [179, "163 BLOWPIPE EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. by communicating its own color. A glass of borax containing potash becomes blue when a little oxalate of nickel is carefully added, and one of soda, brown ; and this holds good for the potash salt, although soda be present. A lithia salt fused on platina foil, if soda be pres ent, produces a yellow stain ; but this stain is produced also by other reagents. If a lithia mineral be mixed with 1 part of fluor finely pulverized, and lj parts of bisulphate of potash, the flame is red ; if no lithia is present, it is faint violet. 3. Lime. \u2014 Lime and lime salts give a brilliant white light. They sometimes tinge the flame reddish, but more faint than carbonate of strontia. 4. Magnesia. \u2014 Magnesia and many magnesian silicates afford a clear rose-red color with cobalt solution, after a long heat. A frag ment after heating, should be moistened with the solution, and then heated again ; the color deepens on cooling. Magnesia is not acted on by soda. 5. Alumina. \u2014 If a fragment of alumina, or if an aluminous sili cate after heating to redness, be moistened by cobalt solution and again heated, but not to fusion, it assumes a fine blue color. The harder species should be finely pulverized. The test is sure except when oxyds of certain metals are present ; and also when saltpeter is present, since it gives a blue color with silica and zirconia, and in some other cases. 6. Arsenic and Arsenical Compounds. \u2014 Give off an alliaceous odor when heated on charcoal or with soda. With many of the compounds heated in a tube, white arsenic or orpiment is con densed ; and with charcoal metallic arsenic is obtained on the tube in crystals. 7. Selenium and Seleniurets. \u2014 Give a horse-radish odor in the outer flame ; yield in a tube a sublimate in the form of a dark red powder. 8. Sulphurets. \u2014 A glass made of soda and silica becomes red or orange yellow when sulphur is present. Heated on charcoal with soda and then adding a drop of water, the sulphurets yield sulphuretted hydrogen, which blackens silver foil or test paper containing acetate of lead. Heated in a glass tube closed below, with litmus paper above, they ledden the paper and yield often a sulphureous odor. 9. Tellurium and Tellurets. \u2014 Give fumes but no odor. Heated on charcoal, the oxyd covers the charcoal with a brownish yellow coating, and the inner flame directed upon this coating is tinged bright green. In a tube the fumes rise and coat the glass, and when heated the coating melts into drops, which are but slowly driven off by the continued heat. 10. Chromium. \u2014 Oxyd of chromium with borax gives an emerald green color ; but on platina wire in the outer flame the color nearly disappears. Chromic iron gives the same color, and it is brightened on the addition of tin-foil. 11. Antimony. \u2014 The ores of antimony afford fumes usually white"], [180, "164 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. on charcoal, which are inodorous. The oxyds form with soda on the platina wire, a clear colorless bead, which becomes white on cooling ; on charcoal they are reduced. In an open tube, antimo ny gives white fumes, which coat the glass, and vaporize easily on a new application of the heat, without fusion to globules. 12. Bismuth. \u2014 Fuses and gives off inodorous fumes. On char coal it becomes surrounded with a dark brown oxyd, which is pale yellow on cooling ; the flame directed on the coating is not tinged. 13. Titanium. \u2014 Titanic acid with borax yields a colorless glass, which becomes milk-white on flaming, if not without. In the inner flame the glass with little of the assay is first yellow and after wards amethystine and transparent. With more assay on charcoal in the inner flame becomes dark blue or nearly black on cooling ; but is pale blue afterwards on flaming. With salt of phosphorus, it forms in the outer flame a clear colorless glass ; in the inner flame, a red or violet blue glass, when cold, especially if tin be added. When iron is present the color after heating in the inner flame is deep red on cooling. Siliceous titanic minerals, as sphene, do not give the reaction with borax, except after long heating in the inner flame with salt of phosphorus, and it is apparent only on cooling. 14. Tin. \u2014 Oxyd of tin is slowly dissolved by borax to a transpa rent glass, which is transparent on cooling. With soda or cyanid of potassium on charcoal it is easily reduced ; and if borax also be added, a very minute quantity of tin may be detected when present in other minerals. 15. Cerium. \u2014 Oxyd of cerium affords with borax and salt of phosphorus, a fine red or dark yellow glass in the outer flame, which becomes white on flaming. The protoxyd changes to peroxyd, and the latter is not changed in the inner flame. In the compounds with silica, cerium is not distinguishable from iron by the blowpipe. 16. Lead. \u2014 Minium is black while hot, but at a low red heat changes to a yellow oxyd. The ores of lead on charcoal, with or without soda, are reduced ; unlike tin, they often give a coating of oxyd on the charcoal, when heated in the outer flame. 17. Zinc. \u2014 Oxyd of zinc with borax gives a clear glass, which is milk-white on flaming, or with more assay, is enamel- white on cool ing. In the inner flame on charcoal, fumes are given off, and a white coating surrounds the assay. With soda on charcoal, the ores, even when containing little zinc, afford the peculiar bluish flame of burning zinc, and the oxyd is deposited on the coal. With cobalt solution, a green color, while tin gives a bluish green. 18. Cadmium. \u2014 Oxyd of cadmium, even when in small propor tions in other minerals, when heated on charcoal deposits a red dish brown powder ; it forms from cadmiferous blende before the zinc begins to incrust the charcoal. 19. Copper. \u2014 Oxyd of copper gives a fine green glass with bo rax, which becomes cinnabar-red on cooling. The ores are re duced on charcoal with soda, and a malleable copper-colored globule obtained ; when the copper is combined with oxyds that are reduced"], [181, "BLOWPIPE EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. 165 together with it, borax and tin should be used. If iron be present, the copper and iron are obtained separately. 20. Manganese. \u2014 Oxyd of manganese gives with borax in the outer flame an amethystine globule, (very deep, with much manga nese), which becomes colorless in the inner flame. With soda on platinum the oxyd gives a green color which is bluish green on cooling. When other metals are present, soda should be added, and then the bluish green color is obtained, even with less than one per cent, of manganese. 21. Iron. \u2014 With borax in the outer flame, oxyd of iron gives a dark red glass, which becomes yellowish or colorless on cooling. In the inner flame it affords a bottle-green color, or a bluish green in a more perfect reduction. With tin the green color is hastened. The peroxyd becomes magnetic when heated in the inner flame. 22. Cobalt. \u2014 Oxyd of cobalt gives a clear blue bead with borax, which does not become opaque on flaming. As in other metallic species, the sulphurets should be roasted before testing for the cobalt. 23. Nickel. \u2014 Oxyd of nickel forms a dark yellow or reddish glass with borax, which is nearly colorless on cooling; but with more of the oxyd, the glass is dark brown, while hot, and becomes red on cooling ; and with saltpetre in the outer flame the color is changed to a blue or deep purple, distinguishing it from oxyd of iron. 24. Silver. \u2014 The ores on charcoal, with or without a flux are reduced to the metallic state. But when other metals are present, lead is to be mixed with the assay with the borax, and thus an alloy of lead and silver formed, from which the silver may be obtained by cupellation. 25. Chlorids. \u2014 A dull green pearl, made by dissolving a little oxyd of copper in salt of phosphorus, becomes surrounded by a fine blue or purple flame, if a chlorid be added. 26. Fluorids. \u2014 When fluorids are heated with salt of phospho rus previously melted in an open glass tube, the glass is corroded, and Brazil paper, if placed within the tube, is turned yellow. The salt of phosphorus for this experiment should be free from all chlorids. 27. Sulphates. \u2014 Like the sulphurets, in their reaction with a glass of borax and silica. 28. Nitrates. \u2014 They detonate on burning coals, and also give off a red gas when heated in a matrass with a drop of sulphuric acid. 29. Phosphates. \u2014 If a phosphate be fused with boracic acid, and the extremity of a small iron wire be inserted into the melted globule, and the whole be heated in the reduction flame, the globule formed at the extremity of the wire will prove to be more or less brittle, when struck with a hammer on an anvil. As the bead cools, a flash of light is usually seen. Before this trial it should be ascertained that no sulphuric or arsenic acid is present, which also may form a globule with the iron ; nor any metallic oxyd reducible by the iron."], [182, "166 CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. 30. Borates. \u2014 When a borate is melted with Turner's reagent, (a mixture of two parts of fluor spar and one of bisulphate of pot ash), the flame is brightly tinged with green. For a more complete account of the blowpipe and of its use in chemical analysis, I would refer to the Treatises by Berzelius and Plattner. 271. In addition to the instruments already described, the follow ing are important : \\. A small hammer, with a slightly rounded face and a transverse sharp edge at the other extremity. 2. An anvil, or piece of steel 3 inches long, 1 broad, and T3\u00a5 thick \u2014 to be used for pulverizing minerals, for which purpose the specimen should be first wrapped in a piece of paper. 3. Platina foil, for enveloping min erals that decrepitate. 4. Fine Platinum wire, bent at one end into a circle one or two lines in diameter ; it very conveniently holds the assay in fusion. 5. Cutting pliers, for separating small fragments of a mineral for assay. 272. Cupellation. \u2014 Cupellation is a process by which one metal in an alloy is oxydized and absorbed by a porous material, and the other left pure. It is used for separating silver and gold from lead. It is performed before the blowpipe by making a small rounded cavity in charcoal, about as deep as broad, (say J inch), putting in fine bone ashes a little moistened, and made smooth by pres sure, and upon this, after drying slowly, the assay ; then heating in the outer flame. When the alloy of silver and lead is thus treated, the lead becomes an oxyd and is absorbed by the bone ashes, and the silver, though extremely minute in quantity, remains as a brilliant globule in the cavity.* When cupellation is performed in the larger way, small cups (cupels) of bone ashes are used, and these are placed in a muffle, made of stone ware, fitted for the circulation of air through it while it is inserted into the side of the furnace. The air and heat oxydize the lead with the same result as described. * A table, by Prof. W\". W. Mather, is contained in the American Journal of Science, [2], iii, 414, which gives the ascertained weight of globules of silver, of given diameters, and it is very convenient when they are so small as to be weighed with great difficulty or doubtful accuracy."], [183, "PART IV. TAXONOMY. I. MINERALOGICAL SPECIES. 273. It has already been remarked, that the power of crystalliza tion in the inorganic kingdom is, in a certain sense, analogous to that of vitality in the other kingdoms of nature. As in these kingdoms, therefore, the existence of species and their peculiarities depend on the action of this vitality, so in the inorganic kingdom, the existence and individuality of species are determined by the power of crys tallization. It must be understood that the term crystallization, as here used, includes not merely the action of the attraction that aggregates the molecules in the formation of a crystal, but also the power that fixes the form and condition of the molecule. Regularly crystallized minerals alone, therefore, are properly per fect individuals in the mineral department; imperfect crystallizations, like the monsters among organic bodies, have arisen from a suspen sion of the regular plan of nature by some extraneous influence. It would, hence, be theoretically correct, and in accordance with the practice in the Botanical and Zoological sciences, to confine the term species to perfectly crystallized individuals, and in the descrip tions, to give their characters alone, reserving for subsequent re mark, the imperfect crystallizations or mineral monsters. But inor ganic nature differs from organic, in this essential particular, that while in the latter, exceptions to this regular organizing action are but seldom observed, in the former, they are far the most numerous, perfect individuals being of comparatively rare occurrence. 274. A mineral species, therefore, is any natural inorganic sub stance, composed of particles capable in favorable circumstances of combining by means of their mutual attractions so as to constitute a crystalline solid. We thus include among mineral species the liquids and gases found in nature, for they require only a proper temperature, or fa vorable circumstances of pressure, and a freedom from disturbing causes, to enable them to assume a regular crystalline form. The conditions of liquidity, gaseity, and solidity, are only different physi cal states of substances, and are never admitted as specific distinc tions ; much less can they separate one division of inorganic spe-"], [184, "168 TAXONOMY. cies from another, and thus be made a criterion for limiting the min eral department. We also include all natural inorganic products, in which a tendency to crystallization can be detected, although they have never been observed in regular crystals. We exclude all me chanical aggregates, which, as they are composed of heterogeneous particles, can never assume, from any innate powers, the forms of a crystalline solid. \"This definition implies that the substance in the case of each spe cies is a definite chemical compound, as such only are of homoge neous composition. But chemical analysis is not therefore always an available test of the homogeneity of a crystal ; crystallization is quite as generally important as a test of chemical combination, and is often referred to for this purpose. 275. The question still arises, what is distinctively a mineral species ? By some authors, every separate chemical compound among minerals has been arranged as a separate species, however like others in crystallization or physical characters. But since it has been found that, in accordance with the principles of isomorphism, there are elements which may replace one another indefinitely and still the form of the crystals remain the same, crystallization has been assumed as the only authoritative test of identity or distinc tion of species : and this idea has been the means of greatly sim plifying the science. The species garnet would make, according to the chemical view, a dozen or more species. The species horn blende includes a still greater variety of different chemical com pounds. Indeed, as magnesia, lime, protoxyd of iron, and protoxyd of manganese, are substitutes for one another in all possible pro portions, the species based on composition alone would be without number. Isomorphism has thus come to the aid of the science, and removed much perplexity. In some instances, this principle has seemed inadequate to meet all cases, \u2014 as with epidote; and while those regarding the crystallographic criterion as paramount have retained together the varieties of like crystallization, others insisting upon a seeming incompatibility of chemical formula have widely distributed them. But keeping crystallization in view \u2014 a quality of the most fundamental character in molecules \u2014 research will yet discover a principle (if not already accomplished) which will give wider limits to isomorphism and include these seemingly anomalous cases. Individuals of analogous constitution that are one in crystallization, are so far identical as to pertain naturally to a common group, whether we call it a genus, family, or species, or by any other name. 276. Minerals are so seldom in distinct crystals, that it becomes necessary to weigh well what importance should be attached to other characters. After crystallographic characters, chemical composition takes the highest place, if both are not on the same level. The physical characters differ much in value."], [185, "CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS. 169 1. Lustre. \u2014 The distinction of metallic lustre from non-metallic, is of the first importance ; but all the different kinds of non-metal lic lustre may be presented by the same species. 2. Streak. \u2014 Highly important character, seldom varying with the color of the mineral. 3. Hardness. \u2014 The liability of some minerals to decomposition, their accidental impurities, and the mechanical states they may present, render this in certain instances a character of some un certainty. An allowance of 05 at least, should usually be made for variation. 4. Specific Gravity. \u2014 Subject to variation, like hardness, espe cially through variations in composition arising from impurities and substitution of isomorphous substances in the composition of species. 5. Color. \u2014 Subject to but little variation in those species that have a metallic lustre, and not without some value in the discrimi nation of non-metallic minerals. 6. Diaphaneity. \u2014 Subject to great variations in the same species. 7. State of Aggregation. \u2014 More especially useful among the metallic minerals, and occasionally among the non-metallic species. 8. Taste. \u2014 Useful only among the soluble minerals. 9. Fracture. \u2014 Seldom of much value except in distinguishing varieties. 10. Refraction, Polarization. \u2014 Of great value in determining the character of crystallized substances, whose form is not distinct. Brewster, by these means, has distinguished species when the mineral was invisible unless magnified. The properties of elastic ity and conductility of heat afford analogous results. 11. Phosphorescence, Electricity, Magnetism, and Odor, are each of limited importance. In the determination of minerals, and especially the establish ment of new species, the value of the above characters should be well weighed. With distinct crystals, identity or non-identity may be fully ascertained. And with a thorough chemical analysis, when the species is crystalline and homogeneous, the determination may be as satisfactory. But when not obviously crystalline, and especially if earthy and opaque, analysis is often unsatisfac tory, as there may be reasonable doubts of the homogeneity of the substance. Physical characters, without chemistry or crystallog raphy, seldom afford a proper basis for the institution of a species. II. CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS. 277. In the classification of minerals it must be fully understood that we are dealing with but a small part of the third department of nature \u2014 the Inorganic Kingdom, (\u00a7 1). The term Mineral King dom, so often used, is fundamentally erroneous, although all natural 22"], [186, "170 TAXONOMY. products not organic may be embraced under it. The distinction between natural and artificial inorganic products is convenient for the student, but is contrary to strict science ; for nothing author izes the wide separation usually admitted but the necessities of the school-room, or the fact that mineral information is the A B C of another science, and the basis of certain arts. Any classification therefore that can claim to be perfect, must take into consideration the whole range of inorganic compounds ; and each species should have its place fixed on the broadest principles of the science of in organic nature. A thorough knowledge of chemistry is required to appreciate such an arrangement, and the fullest development of the science to give it perfection. This view lowers mineralogy from its usual rank along side of botany and zoology, as observed in the introductory remarks to this volume. It exhibits, however, the true character and standing of the science, and enables us to appreciate its real objects and scope, and the basis upon which a classification should rest. Since minerals are treated of apart from other inorganic compounds only for practical purposes, it is not important that the arrangement should depend on the strictest scientific grounds. The special ends of the study may naturally be regarded, and such a classification adopted as shall best promote their accomplishment. These ends are : 1, teaching the distinguishing characteristics of minerals ; 2, giving useful information about species. The union of these two objects, although distinct, is to some extent expected and sought for by the student. Such has been the aim in making out the ar rangement which is here adopted. It is a mixed system, formed with a reference to the natural relations of the species, and at the same time involving a consideration of their chemical composition, the whole combined in the way deemed best for the advancement of the mineralogical student. We have in fact returned to the old-fashioned style of arranging the ores of the metals under the head of each metal, and the alka line and earthy minerals under their bases. Yet we have studied to bring out natural affinities, and when the arrangement failed of exhibiting them, they have been inculcated by full explanations. The silicates in such a practical arrangement, are in general best kept together in associated groups, and the greater part of this portion of the arrangement is based on true chemical principles. 278. Chemistry is slowly preparing the way for a perfect classi fication of inorganic substances, yet it is at present far from this result. Never perhaps in the history of the science have opinions been more widely different than now among the leaders in this de partment. Still, as it is of interest to the student to view minerals in what may be considered their truest scientific relations, a classi fication according in the view of the author with the present con dition of chemical science has been attempted, and is given near the close of the volume. Chemical composition is the source of"], [187, "171 NOMENCLATURE OF MINERALS. physical characters, and physical characters are a guide in properly appreciating the nature of chemical composition. In the arrange ment, we have eschewed all servility to assumed distinctions, and looked for natural groupings in something more than mere external appearance, or mere identity of elements in composition. The isomorphous relations of the species, as far as possible have been considered, and whatever would exhibit true fundamental affinities. III. NOMENCLATURE. 279. A systematic nomenclature like that for botany and zoology, is out of place in this science, for reasons already stated, except it be based upon relations among the whole range of in organic products.* Moreover, it is not necessary nor desirable. The number of minerals known is far less than a thousand, and the double names of Natural History, therefore, can well be dis pensed with. The addition of the termination ite or lite, (originally from Xidoj, stone), or of any other concise affix, answers sufficiently well the purposes of science. The best names allude to some prominent characteristic of the species ; others are given in honor of those who have labored in the science, or in reference to a prom inent locality of a species. As a name is a name after it is once adopted, the origin of the word is not of much importance. Yet it should be remembered that the use of names of persons eminent in other sciences is wholly at variance with good usage and pro priety ; moreover, an attempted flattery of the politically distin guished is degrading to science, and cannot be too strongly dis countenanced. * The author has here departed widely from principles deemed important in former editions of this treatise. The arrangement of Mohs, followed in the main heretofore, has not for some time been esteemed by him satisfactory, and it has been more and more ob vious, with every passing year, that it could not stand the test of the developments of science. Even on its assumed ground of being a natural system, it is in many parts sin gularly artificial ; and now that prejudices of early instruction have lessened, it seems little better in some of its groupings than an ancient classification of plants which arranged the hard wood species in one group, the herbaceous in another, or collected together flowers of a color. For it is on no better ground that the diamond is placed alongside of topaz and sapphire ; spathic iron near heavy spar, (instead of near calcite) ; graphite near psilomelane ; allophane with green malachite ; mica in the same order \"with cron stedtite, spodumene with prehnite ; iolite with quartz and chrysolite : and so on. Some of these, the author in adopting the arrangement, had thrown out ; but others remained, and were inseparable from the system. Yet in justice to this Mineralogist of merited celebrity, it should be said, that very many natural groupings were embraced in his classi fication \u2014 far more, indeed, than in any of the recent chemical systems, for the latter re fusing almost all reference to physical characters, and considering only the elements pre sent, instead of the mutual relations of the constituent elements, broke up species into fragments and strewed them about into most heterogeneous assemblages. The author in this edition has therefore been constrained to adopt an arrangement less presumptuous in its claims. He has had in view the objects of the student, and the prac tical aim of the science, (or rather semi-science, for mineralogy is not more, than this), and it is believed that with the aid of the tables for determining species, the system will be no less convenient than the former for communicating a knowledge of minerals."], [188, "172 TAXONOMY.

NITROGEN-HYDROGEN. NITROGEN. Gaseous. G.= 9757. Colorless. Inodorous. Tasteless. Composition. \u2014 Pure nitrogen, but often mixed with oxygen. Nitrogen extinguishes a lighted candle introduced into it, and is destructive to fife. This gas is given out in great abundance over an extent of four or five acres, near the town of Hoosic, N. Y., and also issues through the waters of the Lebanon Springs, which are not far distant. The Lebanon waters are tasteless, and have a tem perature of 73\u00b0 F., while other springs in the vicinity stand at 52\u00b0. The gas, according to Daubeny, consists of nitrogen 89'4, and oxygen 10'6, or atmospheric air 50, and pure nitrogen 50. At Canoga, Seneca Co., N. Y., there is another nitrogen spring. There are other springs in Virginia, west of the Blue Ridge at Warm and Hot Springs ; in Bun combe Co., N. C. ; and on the Washita in Arkansas. There are many foreign localities. Among them may be instanced the mineral springs of Cheltenham and Harrowgate. At Bath the gas escapes at the rate of 261 cubic inch es a minute, or 222 cubic feet a day ; it contains 2 or 3 per cent, of oxygen, and often a little carbonic acid. This gas is supposed to proceed from a decomposition of the atmosphere, and the form ation of nitric acid from its oxygen and a small portion of the nitrogen. The atmosphere consists of 79 parts of nitrogen and 21 of oxygen, besides a small proportion of carbonic acid. It is about 815 times Ugh ter than water, and 11,605 times lighter than mercury. HYDROGEN. Gaseous. G.=00694. Colorless and inodorous when pure. In dex of refraction, 0'470. Composition. \u2014 Hydrogen gas, but usually impure. It bums with a pale blue flame and little light. Hydrogen is evolved from beds of coal and stagnant pools. But it is usually met with in combination with carbon. The following are some of the gaseous hydrogen compounds : \u2014 Carburetted Hydrogen. \u2014 A gas with an empyreumatic odor, and burning with a bright yellow light. There are two compounds, one CH2=carbon 75, hydrogen 25 ; and the other CaH2=;carbon 85'7, hydrogen 14-3. The latter is the more common in nature, but they are often mixed. Carburetted hydrogen is most abundant about beds of coal and beds of bituminous shale. It often issues with much force from small cavities in the interior of coal mines, forming"], [190, "174 descriptive mineralogy. what is termed a blower. At Fredonia, Chatauque Co., N. Y., there is a copious discharge of gas from a shaft sunk into the slate rock, and it is used for lighting the village. A gasometer of 220 cubic feet is filled in about fifteen hours. The slate contains consider able bituminous matter and some thin coaly seams. This gas is evolved at several other places in the same county, and in other parts of the State. On the Kenawha river, Va., large quantities of gas escape from the \"gas wells,\" and it is used for evaporating the brine. At one of the works of this kind, 450 bushels of salt are made daily. Phosphuretted Hydroqen takes fire on coming into the atmosphere. It has an alliace ous odor and bitter taste. G.=V761. Composition, hydrogen 8-71, phosphorus 91-29. It is one of the products of vegetable decomposition, and occurs about marshy places. It is supposed to constitute the phosphoric matter called jack 6 lantern. Sulphuretted Hydrogen has a putrid odor. Composition, hydrogen 5-824, sulphur 94176. G.=l'19i2. It occurs about sulphur mineral springs issuing through the waters, and is sometimes formed in the vicinity of volcanoes.

MURIATIC ACID.*\u2014 Hydrochloric Acid. Gaseous. G. = T2847. Colorless. Odor pungent. Taste acid. Composition. \u2014 HCl=Hydrogen 2'74, chlorine 97'26. Muriatic acid is one of the constituents of the vapors that issue from active volcanoes. It is sometimes found in solution in crevices about their slopes. \"WATER. Liquid. G. = l. Colorless. Inodorous. Tasteless. Water becomes solid at 32\u00b0 F., forming ice or snow, and boils at 212\u00b0 F. In the sol id state, it has a crystalline structure, and in the condition of snow, often presents com pound crystals, having a stellated form. The angles of the prisms composing them, are 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. A cubic inch of pure water at 60\u00b0 F., and 30 inches of the barometer, weighs 252-458 grains. Composition. \u2014 HO=Oxygen 88-94, hydrogen 11-06. The density of -water is greatest at 39\u00b0 1 F., according to Joule and Playfair, (Phil Mag., xxx, 41, 1847), the most recent investigators of this subject. Despretz obtained 39\u00b0 176 ; Hallstrom 39\u00b0 38 ; Blagden and Gilpin 39\u00b0 ; Hope 39\u00b0 5 ; Muncke 38-804. Below this temperature it expands as it approaches 32\u00b0, owing to incipient crystallization. Water as it occurs in nature is seldom pure. It ordinarily contains some atmospheric air, often pure oxygen and carbonic acid, besides various saline ingredients. For analyses of the waters used in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, by B. Silliman, Jr., see Am. Jour. Sci. [2], ii, 218; and for another of that last mentioned, by M H. Boye\", see same Journal, ix.

II. CARBON- BORON. Carbon occurs crystallized in diamond and graphite, and amorphous in mineral coal. The crystalline forms of diamond and graphite are dif ferent, and carbon must therefore be dimorphous. Mineral coal has been considered a third condition of carbon. The three, as observed by Berze lius, differ in specific gravity, specific heat, conducting power for heat and electricity, and chemical relations ; and besides, while coal is combustible, graphite is so incombustible as to be used for crucibles and furnaces. Carbon combined with oxygen, forming carbonic acid, (Ca,) is of fre quent occurrence in nature. And this acid, united to bases, constitutes the various carbonates, as calc spar, dolomite, magnesite, spathic iron. With hydrogen, carbon forms carburetted hydrogen, (p. 173). Boron occurs in nature only in the condition of boracic acid, (Bo) ; and this acid either exists native, (then called sassolin) ; or in combination alone with bases, as in borax, (hydrous borate of soda), hayesine.

It is not acted on by acids or alkalies. Exhibits vitreous electricity when rubbed. Some specimens, exposed to the sun for a short time, give out bght when carried into a dark place. Index of refraction 2439. The refraction of fight by the diamond is often irreg ular, probably arising from the cause which has produced the convex forms. In some plates from crystals, Descloiseaux has observed a fixed star of six symmetrical rays, and in others allied in character, the rays were replaced by three large elliptical areas. Des cloiseaux shows that the rays are placed symmetrically with reference to the faces of the octahedron, and supposes them to be due to foreign matter. The diamond appears generally to occur in regions that afford a laminated granular quartz rock, called itacolumite, which pertains to the talcose series, and owes its lam ination to a little talc or mica. This rock is found at the mines of Brazil and the Urals, and also in Georgia and North Carolina where a few diamonds have been found. It has also been detected in a species of conglomerate, composed of rounded siliceous pebbles, quartz, chalcedony, <fec, cemented by a kind of ferruginous clay. Diamonds are usually, however, washed out from the soil. According to M. Denis (Ann. des M. [3], xix, 602) the diamond in Minas Geraes, Brazil, is found iu two different deposits ; one, called gur gulho, consisting of broken quartz, and covered by a thin bed of sand or earth ; the other, cascalho, of rolled quartz pebbles united by a ferruginous clay, resting usually on talcose clays, the whole, the debris from talcose rocks. The first deposit affords the finest dia monds, and both contain also gold, platinum, magnetic iron, rutile, &c. The most cele brated mines are on the rivers Jequitinhonha and Pardo, north of Rio Janeiro, where the sands (the waters being turned off) are washed by slaves. It has lately been found in Bahia, on the river Cachoeira. The Ural diamonds occur in the detritus along the Adolfskoi rivulet, where worked for gold, and also at other places. In India, the diamond is met with in the district between Golconda and Masulipatam ; near Parma in Bundelcund, where some of the most magnificent specimens have been found ; also on the Mahanuddy near Ellore. The locality on the island of Borneo, is at Pontiana, on the west side of the Ratoos mountain. The river Gunil, in the province of Constantine in Africa, is reported to have afforded some diamonds. In the United States, a few crystals have been met with in Rutherford Co., N. O, and Hall Co. Ga. (A. J. S. [2], ii, 253). The diamond has been found massive in Brazil, in small black pebbles, having the spe cific gravity 3-012\u20143-416. They proved on trial to be pure carbon excepting 2-07 to 027 per cent. This compact diamond is sold in the region at 75 cents the carat of three and one-sixth grains troy. The largest diamond of which we have any knowledge is mentioned by Tavemier, as in possession of the Great Mogul. It weighed originally 900 carats, or 2769-3 grains, but was reduced by cutting to 861 grains. It has the form and size of half a hen's egg. It was found in 1550, in the mine of Colone. The diamond which formed the eye of a Brahminical idol and was purchased by the Empress Catharine II. of Russia, from a French grenadier, who had stolen it, weighs 194$ carats, and is as large as a pigeon's egg. The Pitt or regent diamond is of less size, it weighing but 136-25 carats or 419J grains ; but on account of its unblemished transparency and color, it is considered the most"], [193, "CARBON. 177 splendid of Indian diamonds. It was sold to the duke of Orleans, by Mr. Pitt, an English gentleman, who was governor of Bencoolen in Sumatra, for \u00a31 30,000. It is cut in the form of a brilliant, and is estimated at .\u00a3126,000. Napoleon placed it in the hilt of his sword of state. The Rajah of Mattan has in his possession a diamond from Borneo, weighing 367 carats. The mines of Brazil were not known to afford diamonds, till the commencement of the 18th century. The crystals they yield are seldom large. Maure mentions one of 120 carats, but they rarely exceed 18 or 20. The famous diamond, weighing 1680 carats, belonging to the Emperor of Brazil, is supposed to be a topaz. Colorless diamonds are most highly esteemed. When cut and polished, a diamond of the purest water in England, weighing one carat, is valued at \u00a38 ; and the value of others is calculated by multiplying the square of the weight in carats by 8, except for those exceeding 20 carats, the value of which increases at a much more rapid rate. This rule is scarcely regarded in market, as the standard of purity and taste for different coun tries differs, and the slightest tinge of color affects greatly the commercial value. The method of polishing diamonds was first discovered in 1456, by Louis Berquen, a citi zen of Bruges, previous to which time, the diamond was known only in its native uncut state. The diamond, besides its use as an ornament, is exceedingly valuable for the purposes of engraving and cutting glass, and the curvature of the crystalline faces much improves it for this purpose. It is also used in powder for polishing and cutting other gems, and in splinters for drilling. It has been used for lenses for microscopes, on account of its slight chromatic aberration, and the large field it consequently affords ; but the crystals often have an irregularity of internal structure, even when clear, which unfits them for this purpose. The term Adamant, Gr. dSai/as, (of which the word diamond is probably a corruption), is supposed to be derived from Greek a, privative, and Sajiaa, to subdue, as if invincible by fire. This name was applied by the ancients to several minerals differing much in their physical qualities. A few of these are quartz, specular iron ore, emery, and other sub stances of rather high degrees of hardness, which cannot now be identified. It is doubt ful whether Pliny had any acquaintance with the real diamond. The diamond is supposed to have been of vegetable origin. It has probably proceeded from the slow decomposition of some vegetable resin or bituminous matter. Black specks, like charcoal, have been observed in some crystals ; but this proves nothing necessarily respecting their origin, since this is the form which carbon uncrystallized assumes, what ever its source.

The anthracites of Pennsylvania contain 85 to 92 per cent, of carbon : those of South Wales, 88 to 95 ; of France, 80 to 83; of Saxony, 81 ; of Russia, sometimes 94 per cent. Anthracites differ much in hardness and readiness of combustion. The softer are called free-burning coals, and contain a trace of bitumen. II. Bituminous Coal. \u2014 The proportion of bitumen is indefinite, varying from 10 to 40 per cent., and the coal is said to be Dry or Fat, according to the amount of bitumen. The coal is softer than anthracite, less highly lustrous, of a more purely black or brownish black color, and the specific gravity varies between 1-2 and l-5 : 1'26 \u2014 1-37, Pennsylvania ; 1-27, Newcastle, England ; 1-199, Lancashire cannel ; 1-27 \u2014 1-32, Scotland; 1-31 \u2014 1-33, France ; 127 \u2014 13, Belgium.

It burns readily, with a yellow flame, but requires frequent stirring t*> prevent its caking, by which the ingress of air for combustion is prevented. Cherry coal resembles caking coal, but does not soften and cake, when heated. It is very frangible, and hence, in mining it, there is considerable waste. Near Birmingham, the loss in mining, including the pillars, amounts to two-thirds of the whole. G.=l-266. It burns more rapidly than caking coal, with a clear yellow flame. Splint coal is a dry coal, harder than the cherry coal ; it is a coarse kind of cannel coal. There are other varieties which are still less bituminous ; the flint coal of England is of this kind, and approaches anthracite ; the_/?ew coal of Wedgebury in Staffordshire is of a similar nature ; and the crow coal of Cumberland at Alston Moor is almost without bitumen. Cannel coal has a dark grayish-black or brownish-black color, a fine compact texture, a large conchoidal fracture, and receives a good polish. It burns readily, without melting, with a clear yellow flame, and it has been used as a substitute for candles, whence its name. It contains about 1 1 per cent, of earthy matter. The combustible part, accord ing to Kirwan, consists of carbon 752, volatile matter 21-7, cinders 3-1. It abounds at Lesmahago, about twenty miles from Glasgow, also in different parts of Ayrshire, where it is made into inkstands, snuff-boxes, and other similar articles. Jet resembles cannel coal, but is blacker, and has a more brilliant lustre. It occurs in detached pieces in clay, on the coast near Whitby in Yorkshire, and at Ballard Point, and elsewhere. It is the Gagates of Dioscorides and Pliny, a name derived from the river Gagas in Syria, near the mouth of which it was found. Brown, coal is more recent in origin than the carboniferous era of geologists. It sometimes closely resembles common bituminous coal. Other varieties have a brownish black color, bright, coal-like lustre, with something of the texture of wood remaining, and often the form and fibre of the original tree is retained : this is called Lignite. Lignite burns with an empyreumatic odor. Brown coal occurs in beds, usually of small extent, and is seldom as pure from pyrites as the more ancient bituminous coal. There are, however, some workable mines. For the geological evidence distinguishing coal of the true carboniferous era, reference may be made to geological treatises. The beds of coal occur interstratified with clay slate, and sandstone, or grit rock, forming distinct layers, varying from a fraction of an inch to 30 feet or more in thickness. In the Umted States the anthracites occur east of the Alleghany range, in rocks that have undergone great contortions and fracturings, while the bituminous are found farther west in rocks that have been less disturbed; and this fact and other observations have led to the view that the anthracites have lost their bitumen by the action of heat. Extensive beds of mineral coal occur in Great Britain, covering about one-tenth the whole area, or 11-859 square miles; in France; in Spain; in Belgium, covering one"], [195, "CARBON. 179 twenty-second the whole area, or 518 square miles; in Netherlands, Prussia, Bavaria, Austria, Northern Italy, Silesia , Spain, Russia on the south near the Azof. It is found in Asia, abundantly in China, in Persia in the Cabul territory, and inKhorassan or North ern Persia, in Hindostan, north of the gulf of Cutch, in the province of Bengal (the Burdwan coalfield) and Upper Assam, in Borneo, Labuan, Sumatra, several of the Phil ippines, Formosa, Japan, New South Wales and other parts of New Holland, New Zealand, Kerguelen's Land ; in America, besides the United States, in Chili, at the Straits of Magellan, Northwest America on Vancouver's Island near the harbor of Camosack, at Melville Island in the Arctic seas, and in the British Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. In the United States there are four extensive coal areas. One of these areas com mences on the north, in Pennsylvania and southeastern Ohio, and sweeping south over western Virginia and eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, to the west of the Apalachians, or partly involved in their ridges, it continues to Alabama near Tuscaloosa, where a bed of coal has been opened. It has been estimated to cover 63,000 square miles. It em braces several isolated patches in the eastern half of Pennsylvania. The whole surface in Pennsylvania has been estimated at 15,487 square miles, or one-third the whole areaof the State. A second coal area (the Illinois) lies adjoining the Mississippi, and covers the larger part of Illinois, the western part of Indiana, and a small northwest part of Ken tucky ; it is but little smaller than the preceding. A third occupies a portion of Missouri west of the Mississippi. A fourth covers the central portion of Michigan. Besides these, there is a smaller coal region (a fifth) in Rhode Island, which crops out across the north end of the island of Rhode Island, and appears to the northward as far as Mans field, Massachusetts. Out of the borders of the United States, on the northeast, com mences a sixth coal area, that of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which covers, in con nection with that of Newfoundland, 18,000 square miles, or 1\u2014 !\u25a0\u00a3 the whole area of these Provinces. The mines of western Pennsylvania, commencing with those of the Blossburg basin, Tioga Co., those of the States west, and those of Cumberland or Frostburg, Maryland ; Richmond or Chesterfield, Va., and other mines south, are bituminous. Those of eastern Pennsylvania, constituting several detached areas, \u2014 one the Schuylkill coal field, on the south, worked principally at Mauch Chunk, on the Lehigh. and at Pottsville, on the Schuylkill, another the Wyoming coal field, worked at Carbondale, in the Lackawanna region, and near Wyoming, besides others intermediate, those of Rhode Island and Mas sachusetts, and some patches in Virginia, are anthracites. Mines of Cannel coal are found near Greensburg, Beaver Co., Pa., also in Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana. In England, the principal coal fields are the Manchester of Lancashire and Cheshire ; the Great Central of South Yorkshire, Nottingham, and Derby ; that of South Wales, Glamorganshire, &c. ; the Newcastle field of northern England. In Scotland, a range of beds extend across from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde, whole area 1650 square miles. In Ireland, the three are the Limerick fields about the mouth of the Shannon, the Kilkenny fields to the eastward, and those of Ulster on the north* Min eral coal occurs in France, in small basins, 88 in number, and covering in all, accord ing to Taylor, XTT \u00b0f *^e whole surface. The most important are the basin of the Loire, between the Loire and the Rhone, and that of Valenciennes on the north, adjoining Bel gium. In Belgium, it occupies a western and eastern division, the western in the prov inces of Namur and Hainault, and the eastern extending over Liege. Coal beds more recent than the true coal era are sometimes worked. That of Rich mond, Virginia, is supposed to be of the has era ; the coal of Brora, in Sutherland, and of Bovey, Yorkshire, are oolitic in age. Tertiary coal occurs on the Cowlitz, in Or egon. Bituminous coal, either cretaceous or oolitic in age, (probably the former), occurs on the Rocky Mountains, according to Lieut. Abert, near the Raton Pass \u2014 lat. 37\u00b0 15', long. 104\u00b0 35' \u2014 also, according to Fremont, near lat. 41^-\u00b0, long. 111\u00b0, on Muddy river. * For full statistics with reference to coal and coal fields, reference may be made to the very complete work on coal by R.

Taylor, in his extensive work on coal, gives the following table showing the proportional areas of coal land in Europe and America, p. xv. \" Hence, as regards European countries, Great Britain takes the first rank : Belgium, as regards territorial proportion, occupies the second rank, although in relative coal area she is the least of the four. Pennsylvania, in respect of territorial proportion, is higher than any of these, being relatively one-third : but in absolute area of coal formation, the four eastern colonies of British America united exceeds them all, being larger than that of Great Britain, France, Belgium and Spain conjoined. This table is not strictly perfect; since we possess the areas of the concessions only in France ; and, in' Spain, only the single coal region of Asturias. We add the areas of Prussia and Austria, but cannot state the proportions of coal formations therein. The American area of coal is nearly three-fourths of the whole amount in our table.\" The vegetable origin of coal is generally admitted. It is proved not only by the pre sence of distinct leaves and fragments of plants along with the coal, and the transitions between them, but also by the detection of the structure of vegetable tissue even in the hardest anthracite.* Fluor spar has been detected associated with cannel coal, by Prof. Rogers.

Graphite occurs in beds and imbedded masses, lamin\u00e6, or scales, in granite, gneiss, mica slate, primitive limestone, and gray-wacke, and is sometimes connected with depos its of coal. It is also met with in greenstone. A remarkable fine variety of graphite occurs at Borrowdale in Cumberland, in nests in a greenstone rock which constitutes a bed in a clay slate. In Glenstrathfarrar in Inver nesshire, it forms nests in gneiss, and is associated with garnet. At Arendal in Norway, it is found in quartz. It occurs at Pargas in Finland, in various parts of Austria, Prussia, France. At Craigman in Ayrshire, it occurs in coal beds, wliich have been formed by contact with trap. Graphite is disseminated in large masses forming veins in gneiss, at Sturbridge, Mass., where it presents a structure between scaly and fine granular, and an occasional approx imation to distinct crystallizations ; also at North Brookfield, Brimfield, and Hinsdale, Mass. ; extensively in Cornwall, near the Housatonic, and in Ashford, Conn. ; also in Brandon, Vt. ; at Greenville, L. O, associated with sphene and tabular spar in primi tive limestone ; in Wake, N. C. ; on Tyger river, and at Spartenburg near the Cowpens Furnace, S. C. Foliated masses of graphite occur near Ticonderoga, on Lake George, upon Roger's Rock, associated with pyroxene and sphene. Near Amity, Orange Co., N. Y., it is met with in white limestone, accompanying spinel, brucite, hornblende, Ac. ; at Rossie, St. Lawrence Co., N Y, with hon ore, and in gneiss ; also in Bucks Co., Penn., three miles from Attleboro', associated with tabular spar, pyroxene, and scapolite ; and one and a half miles from this locality, it occurs in abundance iu syenite, at ManseU's black lead mine. Graphite is extensively employed in the manufacture of pencils. It is also a good material for crucibles, on account of its extreme infusibility ; and is used for diminishing friction in heavy machinery, and for giving a gloss to iron stoves, grates, &c. In the United States, the mines of Stockbridge, Mass., of Ticonderoga and FishMll, N. Y, of Brandon, Vt, and of Wake, N. O, are worked ; and that of Ashford, Conn., form erly afforded a large amount of graphite. The name black lead, often applied to this species, is entirely inappropriate, as it does not contain a trace of lead. The name graphite is derived from ypatjiio, I write, in allusion to its extensive use as a material for writing, arising from its property of leaving a trace on paper.

The native stalactitic salt, according to Klaproth, (Beit, iii, 97), contains, mechanically mixed, sulphate of magnesia and iron, sulphate of lime, silica, carbonate of lime, and alumina. Erdmann has stated, (J. \u00a3 pr. Ch. xiii, 7, 8), that sassolin contains 3-18 per cent, by weight of ammonia, and instead of being pure boracic acid, that it is a borate of ammonia. It fuses in a candle, and at first tinges the flame green ; but this color disappears when the water of crystallization has evaporated. When cooled, the globule has a glassy ap pearance, and is opaque, if any gypsum is present. This species has been found abundantly in the crater of Vulcano, one of the Lipari isles, where it forms a thin layer on the sulphur, and around the fumaroles, or exits of the sul phureous exhalations. It is obtained for the arts from the volcanic fumaroles of Tuscany. The first locality known was at Sasso, from which place it derived its name, Sassolin. The hot vapors at the lagoons or boiling springs of Tuscany, consist largely of boracic acid. The vapors are made to pass through water, which absorbs the boracic acid ; the waters are then evaporated by means of the steam from the springs. These lagoons yield from seven to eight thousand pounds troy per day. The boracic acid thus obtained is in large crystalline flakes. These lagoons spread over a surface of about 30 miles, and in the distance, clouds of vapor are seen rising in large volumes among the mountains. On approaching the place, the earth seems to pour out boding water, as if from volcanoes of various sizes, and the heat in the immediate vicinity is intolerable and the sulphurous smells suffocating.

Selenium rarely occurs native. It is usually combined with the metals, forming seleniurets, and is thus united with silver, mercury, copper, lead, zinc, and bismuth, as well as sulphur. It is isomorphous with sulphur, and forms analogous compounds with oxygen, (se, Se), but neither selenous nor selenic acid has yet been found native, and the latter is rarely met with combined with oxyd of lead.

Composition. \u2014 Pure sulphur, but often contaminated with clay or bitumen ; burns with a bluish flame at a low temperature, with the strong odor of sulphurous acid ; becomes resinously electrified by friction ; is insoluble in water, and not acted on by the acids. Sulphur is dimorphous, the crystals being obtuse oblique rhombic prisms, with M : M= 90\u00b0 32', and P : e (plane truncating the obtuse or front lateral edge)=95\u00b0s46', when formed at a moderately high temperature, (125\u00b0 C, according to Frankenheim). The great repositories of sulphur are either beds of gypsum and the associate rocks, or the regions of active and extinct volcanoes. In the valley of Noto and Mazzaro in Sicily, at Conil near Cadiz in Spain, Bex in Switzerland, and Cracow in Poland, it occurs in the former situation. Sicily, and the neighboring volcanic isles, the Solfatara near Naples, the volcanoes of the Pacific ocean, (fee, are localities of the latter kind. The crystals from Sicdy are sometimes two or three inches in diameter. It is also deposited from hot springs in Iceland ; and in Savoy, Switzerland, Hanover, and other countries, it is met with in certain metallic veins. At Radoboy, near Crapina in Croatia, it occurs in im bedded spheroidal masses, which have a brownish tinge, owing to the presence of bitu men. Sulphur is found as a deposit about the sulphur springs of New York, Virginia, <fec, and occurs also in coal deposits and elsewhere, where sulphuret of iron is undergoing de composition ; also in microscopic crystals at some of the gold mines of Virginia. It oc curs in masses in limestone on the Potomac, 25 miles above Washington. The sulphur mines of SicUy, the crater of Vulcano, and the Solfatara near Naples, af ford immense quantities of sulphur for commerce. Previous to becoming an article of commerce, it is purified by fusion or sublimation. It is also largely obtained in roasting the sulphurets of iron and copper. The manufacture of gunpowder, of sulphuric acid, casts, cements, and various pharmaceutical preparations, are among the important pro cesses in which sulphur is required. SULPHURIC ACID. Liquid.

This acid, in a ddute state, has been found in the neighborhood of several vol canoes. According to Professor Baldassari, it occurs near Sienna, in the cavities of the small volcanic mountain named Zocolino. Pictet asserts, also, that he has distilled it from a cavern near Aix, in Savoy. Water strong with sulphuric acid occurs at Alabama, Genesee Co. N. Y. ; also in Tuscarora, 20 miles north of Port Dover, Lake Erie, Canada. The former was found by B. Silliman, Jr., to contain 40 grains in a gallon ; the latter 4 parts of free sulphuric acid in 1000, besides sulphates of the alkalies, lime, magnesia, alum and oxyd of iron.

Sulphurous acid is evolved from most active volcanoes. The sulphur about vol canoes is sometimes produced by the meeting of this gas with sulphuretted hydrogen, causing a mutual decomposition and a deposition of sulphur. Sulphurous acid is often used for bleaching. NATIVE SELENIUM. In incrustations of a submetallic lustre ; and grayish or brownish black color ; translucent and red in thin splinters. Powder deep red.

Ammonia, a gaseous alkali in the pure state, is contained to some ex tent in the atmosphere, and in the soils where animal decomposition is in progress. Many mineral decompositions taking place in contact with water and the atmosphere and absorbing oxygen, also produce ammonia. It is also found as a muriate, sulphate, carbonate, and phosphate ; and also as a magnesian phosphate, (struvite), and soda phosphate, (stereo rite). Owing to its volatility it is easily driven off from its combinations, when the assay is heated with soda, and a pungent odor (often called harts horn) is perceived. The salts are for the most part soluble, and have an acrid taste."], [201, "185 AMMONIA. SAL-AMMONIAC. Muriate of Ammonia. Chlorid of Ammonium. Salmiak, X. Naturlicher Salmiac, W.

Occurs about volcanoes, as at Etna, the island of Vidcano, Vesuvius, and the Sand - wich Islands. It has been observed in small quantities in the vicinity of ignited coal seams, as at St. Etienne, in France, and also at Newcastle, and in Scotland. It occurs also in Bucharia ; at Kilauea in Hawaii, a variety which contains largely of iron, and be comes rusty yellow on exposure. Sal ammoniac has not been found in nature in sufficient quantities for commerce. It is manufactured from refuse animal matter, coal, soot, and the waters of gas works. It is a valuable article in medicine and dyeing, and is employed by tinmen to prevent the oxydation of metallic surfaces that are to be tinned or soldered ; also mixed with iron filings to pack the joints in steam apparatus. The aAs i/i/\u00a3u\u00ab\u00abSf, sal-ammoniac of Dioscorides, Celsus, and Pliny, is fully proved by Beckmann (Hist of Inventions, iv, 360) to be common rock salt. It is described by Pliny as a native salt, dug in Egypt, near the oracle of Ammon, whence its name ; this name was afterwards transferred to the muriate of ammonia, when, subsequently, it was manufactured in Egypt Sal-ammoniac is not supposed to have been entirely unknown to the ancients, but to be described, in connection with one or two other species, under the name of nitrum, which, according to Pliny, gave the test of ammonia when mingled with quicklime.

A purplish blue variety owes its color to a trace of iodine, a red variety to oxyd of iron, and another to infusoria. Dissolves in three parts of water ; attracts moisture, but is unchanged in a dry atmosphere. When heated, it usually decrepitates, owing to water between the lamin\u00e6 ; the native rock salt, containing no water, fuses at a red heat with out decrepitation. The martinsite of Karsten (J. f. pr. Ch. xxxvi, 127) contains 9'02 per cent, of sul phate of magnesia, which is equivalent to 10 parts of common salt to 1 of sulphate of magnesia. Common salt usually occurs in extensive but irregular beds in rocks of various ages, associated with gypsum, polyhalite, clay, sandstone, and calcareous spar ; also dissolved, and forming salt springs. In Europe it usually occurs in the new red sandstone, or associated with red marl, hut it is not confined to these rocks. At Durham, Northumberland, and Leicestershire, Eng land, salt springs arise from the carboniferous series ; in the Alps, some salt works are supplied from oolitic rocks ; the famous mines of Cardona and Wieliczka are referred, the former to the green sand formation, and the latter to tertiary rocks. Salt springs also occur in volcanic regions. In the United States the brines mostly come from the sand stones below the coal. It also occurs as efflorescences over the dry prairies of the Rocky Mountains, and California ; and in most desert or semi-desert regions there are numerous salt lakes. The principal mines of Europe are at Wieliczka, in Poland ; at Hall, in the Tyrol ; and along a range through Reichenthal in Bavaria, Hallein in Saltzburg, Halstadt, Ischl, and Ebensee, in Upper Austria, and Aussee in Styria ; in Hungary, at Marmoros and else where ; in Transylvania ; Wallachia, Gallicia, and Upper Silesia ; Vie and Dieuze in France ; Valley of Cardona and elsewhere, in Spain, forming hills 300 to 400 feet high; Bex, in Switzerland ; and Northwich in Cheshire, England. At Cheshire it occurs in a basin-shaped deposit, and is arranged in spheroidal masses, from 5 to 8 feet in diameter, which are composed of concentric coats, and present polygonal figures. It is but little contaminated with impurities, and is prepared for use by merely crushing it between iron rollers. At the Austrian mines, where it contains much clay, the salt is dissolved in large chambers, and the clay thus precipitated. After ten days or a fortnight, the wa ter fully saturated with the salt, is conveyed by aqueducts to evaporating houses, and the chambers, after being cleared out, are again filled. It also occurs forming hills and extended plains near Lake Oroomiah ; about Algeria, abundantly ; in India in the province of Lahore, and in the valley of Cashmere ; in China and Asiatic Russia ; in South America, in Peru, and the Cordilleras of Grenada In the United States, salt has been found forming large beds with gypsum, in Virginia, Washington Co., 18 miles from Abingdon, and in the Salmon River Mts. of Oregon. Brine springs are very numerous in the Middle and Western States. The most famous of these springs are at Salina, in N. Y., in the Kenawha Valley, Va., and Muskingum, Ohio, and in Kentucky. The salt water is obtained by boring, and raised by means of machinery, and thence conveyed by troughs to the boilers, where it is evaporated usually"], [209, "POTASSA SODA. 193 by the direct application of artificial heat; sometimes by the heat of steam, and occa sionally by exposure to the heat of the sun.

It is soluble in water ; the solution changes vegetable blues to green. With fluor 6par and bisulphate of potash, it colors the flame around the powder a clear green. Borax was originally brought from a lake in Thibet, containing both borax and com mon salt, which, from its elevated situation, is frozen the greater part of the year. The borax is dug in masses from the edges and shallow parts of the lake, and in the course of a short time the holes thus made are again filled. This crude borax was formerly sent to Europe under the name of tincal, and there purified. It is now extensively made from the boracic acid of the Tuscany lagoons, by the reaction of this acid on carbonate ol soda. It has also been found at the mines of Potosi in Peru, and also in Ceylon. This salt is employed in several metallurgical operations as a flux, is sometimes used in the manufacture of glass and gems, and extensively in the process of soldering. 25"], [210, "194 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. III. BARYTA\u2014 STRONTIA. Baryta and Strontia are found combined with sulphuric and carbonic acids ; also in some silicates, as the zeolites, brewsterite, and harmo tome, and in certain ores of manganese, especially psilomelane and brau nite. The earths have high specific gravities, and give the same pecu liarity to their salts. They are isomorphous, and may also replace differ ent oxyds of the magnesian series. The carbonates of baryta and strontia are isomorphous with arrragonite, one of the forms of carbonate of lime, and also with carbonate of lead, while the sulphates of baryta and strontia are in like manner isomorphous with the sulphate of lead. Bromlite, a carbonate of baryta and lime, belongs to the arragonite series. Moreover it is the same compound with baryto-calcite, which is monoclinic. The species here included range in specific gravity between 3-5 and 4-8. None of them are soluble. None form a jelly with acids or give the reaction ofthe silicates. The sulphates fuse with more or less diffi culty or not at all, and are insoluble in the acids. The carbonates effer vesce with acids, and fuse easily or not at all. HEAVY SPAR. Sulphate of Barytes.

Oxyd of iron, silica, carbonate of lime, and alumina, occur sometimes as impurities, and sulphate of strontian is a common ingredient. Freisleben found 8 per cent, of silica in a variety from Nassau ; and Rammelsberg 1512 per cent, of sulphate of strontia in another from Gorzing ; G.= 4488. The Allomorphite of Breithaupt contains 190 per cent, of sulphate of lime. Hepatite is an impure spar affording a fetid odor on friction. Decrepitates before the blowpipe, and difficultly fusible, or only on the edges. In the inner flame is reduced to a sulphuret and the globule, when moistened, smells slightly hepatic. Not acted npon by the acids. Does not tinge the flame red like strontian when tested with muriatic acid and alcohol. Heavy spar occurs commonly in connection with beds or veins of metallic ores. It is met with in secondary limestones, sometimes forming distinct veins, and often in crystals, aloDg with crystallizations of lime and strontian. AtDufton, England, large transparent crystals occur; one of them of a tabular form, in Mr. Allan's cabinet, weighs forty-two pounds, and measures ten inches across its basal plane. Some of the most important European localities are at Felsobanya and Kremnitz m Hungary, and Roya and Roure in Auvergne. At Freiberg in Saxony, a variety occurs composed of indistinct prismatic crystals and having a pearly lustre ; this is the Stangen spath of Werner. Rounded masses, composed of diverging columnar particles, occur at Mount Paterno, near Bologna, and have hence been called the Bolognese stone. At Staf fordshire and Derbyshire is found an opaque massive variety of an earthy appearance and dirty-white color ; this variety has been called cawk. In Cheshire, Conn., large crystals, sometimes transparent, occur in veins of red Band stone with vitreous copper and green malachite. Other similar localities are at Berlin, Farmington, and Southington, of the same State. A massive variety, indistinctly and very delicately fibrous, and with banded shades of reddish, grayish, and yellowish shades occurs iu large masses, at Pillar Point, opposite Sackett's Harbor, N. Y., constituting a vein, two to three feet thick, in compact limestone. Large slabs, when polished, are often quite beautifuL Earthy and foliated varieties are found at the Perkiomen lead mine, in Pennsylvania. At Scoharie, N, Y., a fibrous variety occurs with carbonate of lime, and the two are often mechanically mingled. In St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., fine tabular crys tals oocur in De Kalb, at Fowler with specular iron, at the Parish ore bed with calc spar aDd specular iron, and on the banks of Laidlaw lake in Rossie : and the crested barytes is found at Hammond, with crystals of iron pyrites.

Lime does not occur native. It is found abundantly as a carbonate, constituting thus the ordinary limestone and marbles. As a sulphate, it forms gypsum and anhydrite. It also exists in combination with phospho ric, arsenic, antimonic, tungstic, titanic, and columbic acids. Also with silica as a silicate of lime in tabular spar, dysclasite, apophyllite, datholite, and some allied species ; in the zeolites, heulandite, laumonite, stilbite, epistilbite, thomsonite, edingtonite, phillipsite, lime-mesotype, prehnite, chabazite ; in anorthite, and labradorite, scapolite, latrobite, gehlenite ; in epidote, idocrase, and garnet ; and in augite, hornblende, and many other silicates, it replaces magnesia. Besides, there are fluorids and chlorids of calcium. Magnesia exists pure in the mineral periclase. It is also abundant as a carbonate, but occurs more commonly along with lime, constituting dolo mite ; it is also met with combined with phosphoric, sulphuric, and nitric acids ; it characterizes a large number of hydrous silicates, allied to talc and serpentine ; and exists also in the anhydrous silicates, augite, horn blende, chrysolite, boltonite, chondrodite ; and in combination with alumi na it forms spinel. Lime and magnesia are isomorphous, as already explained. Yet there are large classes of compounds, as the zeolites and feldspars, in which magnesia seldom takes the place of lime. Carbonate of magnesia and lime mingle in various proportions under a common crystalline form ; and these pass so gradually into carbonates of iron and manganese, that the varieties are separated with difficulty ; carbonate of zinc belongs to the same group.

At a high heat it fuses with difficulty to a white enamel. The white powder obtained by heat, if moistened, soon becomes very firmly solid. No effervescence with acids when pure. Soluble in 400 to 500 parts of water. The transparent varieties have been distinguished by the name Selenite ; the fine massive varieties are called Alabaster ; the fibrous, Satin Spar. Schaumkalk is a vari ety in small scales of a pearly lustre. Gypsum often forms very extensive beds in sec ondary countries, and is also found in tertiary and recent deposits ; occasionally in crys talline rocks. It is also a product of volcanoes, occurring about fumaroles or where sul phur gases are escaping, being formed from the sulphuric acid generated, and the lime afforded by the decomposing lavas \u2014 lime being contained in augite and labradorite. It is also produced by the decomposition of pyrites when lime is present ; and often about sulphur springs where sulphuretted hydrogen is emitted, this gas changing through reac tion with vegetable matter into sulphuric acid. Gypsum is also deposited on the evapo ration of sea-water, and brines. Fine specimens are found in the salt mines of Bex in Switzerland ; at Hall in the Ty rol ; in the sulphur mines of Sicily ; in the gypsum formation, near Ocana, in Spain ; in the clay of Shotover Hill, near Oxford ; and large lenticular crystals have been met with at Montmartre, near Paris. Derbyshire affords the fibrous varieties. Alabaster occurs at Castelino 35 miles from Leghorn, whence it is taken to Florence for the manufacture of vases, figures, cfec. Gypsum also occurs in acicular crystals in most volcanic regions. This species occurs in extensive beds in several of the United States ; and more partic ularly New York, Ohio, Illinois, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas, and is usually asso ciated with salt springs. Also in Nova Scotia, Peru, Ac Handsome selenite and snowy gypsum occur in New York, near Lockport, in limestone along with pearl spar and anhydrite ; also near Camillus, Onondaga County, and occa sional crystals are met with in the vicinity of Manlius. In Ohio, lange transparent crys tals (fig. 1) have been found at Poland and Canfield, Trumbull County: in Maryland, large grouped crystals on the St. Mary's in clay ; also near the mouth of the Patuxent ; in Iowa, in perfect crystals, in the shales of the coal measures on Cedar river, a branch of the Des Moines, and elsewhere on the latter river. Selenite and alabaster occur in Da vidson County, Tennessee, and large beds of gypsum with rock salt in Washington Coun ty, Virginia, eighteen miles from Abingdon. In the Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, it pre sents singular imitations of vines, flowers, and shrubbery, (see \u00a7 129). Plaster of Paris is gypsum which has been heated and ground up. It is used for making moulds, taking casts of statues, medals, Ac, for producing a hard finish on walls ; also in the manufacture of artificial marble, as the scagliola tables of Leghorn, and in the glazing of porcelain. Gypsum is also employed for improving lands. The uses of ala baster are well known. The fibrous variety when cut en cabochon, and polished, reflects light simUarly to cat's eve. Note. \u2014 The gypsum of East River, Pictou, Nova Scotia, according to Prof. W. R. John son, and that of Southern Virginia, according to Prof. W. B. Rogers,_(Am. Jour. Sci. [2] v, 113, 1848), contain 1 atom of water to 2 of sulphate of lime, (2CaS-|-fl). The pas sage of anhydrite into gypsum is exemplified on a large scale in many places, as at the Cauaria valley and at Bex in Switzerland, ( Blum, Pseud, p. 24 ; Am. jour. Sci. xlviii, 69), and the compound here described may have been formed in the course of the transition. ANHYDRITE. Cube Spar, Muriacite, W. Karstenite, Haus. Vulpinite. Anhydrous Sulphate of Lime.

With borax, dissolves with effer vescence to a transparent glass, becoming yellow or brownish-yellow on cooling. Anhydrite often attracts moisture, and assumes an appearance somewhat resembling gypsum. It is readily distinguished by its cleavage. Anhydrite has been variously denominated muriacite, anhydrite, tripe stone, (gekross tein), according to its structure ; the first, when crystallized in broad lamell\u00e6 ; the sec ond, when granular ; and the third when composed of contorted particles. Vulpinite_ is a siliceous variety, containing 8 per cent, of silex, and having the hardness 35. Pseudo morphs in cubes, imitative of rock salt, have been described by Haidinger. Crystallized anhydrite occurs at the salt mines of Bex in Switzerland, and at Saltz burg near Hall in the Tyrol. At Aussee, both crystallized and massive, the latter brick red. Also at Sulz on the Neckar, in Wiirtemberg ; at Bleiberg in Carinthia ; at Lune berg, Hanover ; at Lauterberg in the Hartz ; at Kapuik in Hungary ; at Ischl in Up per Austria ; and at Berchtesgadeu in Bavaria. The variety gekrosstein has been found principaDy at Wieliczka in Poland. The Vulpinite, from Vulpino, Italy, admits of being cut and polished for ornamental purposes. In the United States it has been found at Lockport, N. Y., of a fine blue color, in geodes of black limestone, accompanied with crystals of calcareous spar and gvpsum. The de composed variety has also been observed at the same place, forming a thin incrustation on the foliated variety, and also between the folia. In Nova Scotia it forms extensive beds at the estuary of the Avon and the St. Croix river, and is common elsewhere, associated with gypsum, in the carboniferous formation. EPSOMITE, Beud. Epsom salt.

Very soluble in water. Does not effervesce with the acids. This salt is a frequent ingredient in mineral waters, and often occurs also as an efflorescence on rocks. In the former state it exists at Epsom, who=e springs have long been famous. At Idria, in Carniola, it occurs in silky fibres, and is hence called hairsall by the workmen. It is also obtained at the gypsum quarries of Montmartre, near Paris; in Fitou, Dep. of the Aude, France ; in Arragon and Catalonia, in Spain ; in the Cordil lera of St. Juan, in Chili ; and in a grotto in Southern Africa, where it forms a layer 1| inches thick. The salt from this last locality was analyzed by Stromeyer, and found to contain, sulphate of magnesia 42-654, sulphate of manganese 7667, water 49213 =99-564. The roof of the grotto is a quartzose conglomerate, containing manganese and pyrites. The floors of the limestone caves of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana, are, in many instances, covered with Epsom salt, in minute crystals, mingled with the earth. In the Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, it adheres to the roof in loose masses like snow balls. It"], [220, "204 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. effloresces from the calcareous sandstone, ten miles from Coeymans, on the east face of the Helderberg, N. Y. Said to occur also over the California plains, east of San Diego. (Am. Jour, of Sci., [2] vi, 389). Sulphate of magnesia is dimorphous. According to Haidinger and Mitscherhch, the above described form is produced when crystallization takes place below 15\u00b0C. (60\u00b0F), but a monoclinic form, between 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C.

Very deliquescent before, but not after being desiccated by heat. It occurs in silky efflorescences, in many limestone caverns, as those of Kentucky. The salt forms in covered spots of earth where the soil is calcareous, and is extensively used in the manufacture of saltpeter. NITROMAGNESITE, Shep. Nitrate of Magnesia. Magnesia Saltpeter. In deliquescent efflorescences. Color white. Composition.\u2014 MgS'+fl=Nitric acid 64-8, magnesia 24-4, water 10-8. Very deli quescent. Occurs in limestone caverns with nitrate of lime. CALC FAMILY. The Calc Family includes the carbonate of lime, of magnesia, of pro toxyd of iron, zinc, manganese, with the combinations of these isomor phous carbonates with one another, which are in various proportions, having the general formula, (Ca, Mg, fe, Mn, Zn)C. They crystallize in rhombohe drons, varying in angle from 105\u00b0 to 107\u00b0 40'. Cleavage rhombohedral, perfect. G. 26 \u2014 399. Soluble in acids with effervescence, though in some cases with difficulty, unless pulverized and heated. The carbonate of lime is dimorphous, and this will probably prove true also of the other carbonates. Breithaupt distinguishes among these carbonates 24 species,* while others reduce them to 5 or 6. The gradations are such, both in composi tion and crystalline form, that the nice distinctions introduced by this mineralogist cannot be sustained, and they are the more objectionable since it has been found that the same rhombohedron may have its three * The following are Breithaupt's subdivisions : \u2014 1.

The colored varieties often contain as impurities, small portions of oxyd of iron, silica, magnesia, alumina, bitumen, &c. Gibbs found in a specimen from the Calamine mines of Altenberg, 4074 oxyd of zinc, with 0849 magnesia, 0512 protoxyd of iron. A variety called plumbocatcite from Leadhills contains, according to Delesse, 9791 car bonate of lime, and 234 carbonate of lead. Jolinston found in the same from Wanlock head, Scotland, 78 per cent, of carbonate of lead. B.B. infusible ; loses, however, carbonic acid, gives out an intense light, and ultimately is reduced to pure lime, or quicklime. Effervesces with borax, and produces with a larger quantity, a clear glass, which becomes somewhat angular on cooling. With cobalt solution affords a black or gray-black umnelted mass. Many granular limestones phosphoresce with a yellow light when pulverized and thrown on a heated shovel. Acids produce a brisk effervescence. Calcite appears under a very great variety of forms and aspects, and, consequently was distributed by the earlier mineralogists into several distinct species. These now constitute varieties. The term Iceland spar is applied to transparent cale spar ; the best specimens come from Iceland. Satin spar is a fibrous carbonate of lime, having a delicate satin lustre. Oolite is a compact limestone consisting of minute spherical grains or particles resembling the roe of a fish ; it is so called from wov, an egg. The Peastone, or Pisolite, differs from oolite in the larger size of its particles. These particles are composed of concentric lamin\u00e6. Chalk is a massive opaque variety, usually white and possessing a purely earthy aspect, and absence of lustre. It is usually much softer than the other varieties of this species. Agaric Mineral, or Pock Milk, is a loose friable variety, deposited from waters containing carbonate of lime in solution It is found about lakes whose waters are im pregnated with lime ; also, in fissures in limestone, and in limestone caverns. The mate rial is called calcareous tufa if so hard as not to be friable. Prunnerite is grayish vio let, from Faroe. Marble includes all the imperfectly crystalline and earthy varieties which admit of a high polish. The Stinkstone, Swinestone, or Anthraconite, which is found columnar, granular, and compact, of various shades, emits a fetid odor, when struck with a hammer. Stalactites are pendant masses of limestone, formed iu limestone caverns by the percolation of water, holding lime in solution, through their rocky roofs. The water which drops to the floor from the roof also evaporates, and forms a layer of lime stone over the floor, which is called Stalagmite. Argentine possesses a silvery white lustre, a slaty structure, and contains a little silica. Slate spar and aphrite are similar varieties. Marl is a mixture of clay and carbonate of lime. The Fontainbleau Limestone is an ag gregate of secondary rhombohedrons, containing, mechanically mingled, large portions of sand. Granular limestone includes common statuary and architectural marble, having a tex ture something like loaf sugar. Compact limestone has a compact texture, usually an even surface of fracture, and dull shades of color. Hydraulic limestone is an impure limestone. The French varieties contain 2 or 3 per cent, of magnesia, and 10 to 20 of silica and alumina, (or clay). The varieties in the United States contain 20 to 40 per cent, of magnesia, and 12 to 30 per cent, of silica and alumina. A variety worked extensively at Rondout, N. Y., afforded Prof. Beck (Min. N. Y., p. 78), Carbonic acid 34-20, lime 25-50, magnesia 12-35, silica 15 37, alumina 913, peroxyd of iron 225. Oxyd of iron is rather prejudicial to it than otherwise. The Cipolin marbles of Italy are white with shadings or zones of green talc. The bardi glio is a gray marble having a whitish basis with crowderl dark cloudings, from Corsica. The Sienna is yellow with cloudings, and Brocatello di Sienna has clouds of bluish red or purplish shades. Portor is a Genoese marble of deep black color with veinings of yellow ; the best is from Porto- Venese. Bird's-eye marble is a compact limestone with crystalline points disseminated through it. Ruin marble is yellowish with brownish sha dings or lines representing castles, towers, and cities in ruins ; the markings are due to infiltrated oxyd of iron or manganese. Shell marble contains scattered fossil shells ; crin oidal or encrinital includes joints of encrinites of a disk-shape ; madreporic marble is made up of fossil corals, and has a stellate surface when polished. Fire marble or luma-"], [224, "208 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. chelle is a dark brown shell marble, having brilliant fire or chatoyant reflection from within. Languedoc marble is of a light red color, with lighter spots due to corals. The marble of Sarancolin in the Pyrenees is deep red mixed with gray and yellow, and some transparent spots. Marl contains often 40 to 50 per cent, of carbonate of lime. This species, in some form, is very generally diffused. England and France contain extensive strata of chalk. Italy, from her Carrara beds, and Greece, from the Pentelican quarries, have provided the world with statuary marble. The greater part of the middle and western sections of the United States are underlaid with strata of limestone, and white or granular limestone occurs in various portions of the Eastern States. The most interesting localities of calc spar in the United States, both as regards size of crystals and crystalline form, exist in St. Lawrence and Jefferson Counties, New York. The finest specimens have been obtained at the Rossie lead mine. The crystals are highly modified and often transparent even when large. One gigantic crystal, nearly transpa rent, in the cabinet of Yale College, weighs 165 pounds. At the natural dam, two miles from Gouverneur, in the same vicinity, good crystals are obtained ; also at the Wilson vein in Gouverneur, and the Jepson vein in Rossie. At the Paris ore bed in Gouverneur fine geodes occur in specular iron. In Jefferson County, near Oxbow, on the land of Mr. Benton, large crystals, sometimes as clear within as Iceland spar, have been obtained from a decomposing limestone. The rose and purple varieties are very beautiful. Some gigantic crystals weigh a hundred pounds and upwards. Four mdes BOuth of Ox bow, in Antwerp, there is a vein of calc spar and lead, which affords beautiful cleavage masses of white, purple, and brownish Bhades. Interesting crystallizations are also pro cured here. In Essex County, N. Y., town of Moriah, on Mill brook, near Port Henry, crystals of calc spar occur in white limestone. Dog tooth spar (fig. 4, and fig. 116, plate 2) occurs of great beauty in Niagara County, near Lockport, with pearl spar, celestine, selenite, and anhydrite : also in Onondaga County, near Camillus, along the railroad. Good crystals are found in Herkimer County, a mile south of Little Falls, in the bed of a small stream ; in Lewis County, at Leyden and Lowville, and at the Martinsburg lead mine ; and on the western bank of Dry Sugar River, near Boonville, Oneida County. In Maine, at Thomaston, lenticular and prismatic crystals are common. In New Jersey, at Bergen, fine crystallizations of yellow calc spar occur with datholite, <fec, in trap ; at Franklin, a pink variety is met with, and good cleavage specimens may be obtained. In Nova Scotia, Partridge island affords a wine-colored calc spar, and other interesting vari eties. In Pennsylvania, Iceland spar in York County. Argentine occurs near Williamsburg and Southampton, Mass., and at the iron mines of Franconia, N. H. Agaric mineral covers the sides of a cave at Watertown, N. Y. Stalactites of great beauty occur in the celebrated Wier's cave, Virginia, and the large caves of Kentucky. Fine specimens are also found in the many caverns of Scoharie, N. Y, of which Ball's cave is the most fa mous. Fibrous carbonate of lime occurs in New York in considerable abundance at Camillus and Scoharie, (near the barytes locality), and of a fine satin lustre near De Long's mill, St. Lawrence County. Corals of which large reefs are formed in tropical regions, consist mainly of carbonate of lime. B.

The material of our common marbles is either granular or compact limestone. These rocks when burnt form quicklime. A fine compact limestone is employed in lithography, and that from Solenhofen near Munich, is most noted. Calc spar is also used as a flux for smelting ores. Hydraulic limestone appears to owe its peculiar qualities to the clay present, which is very uniformly and intimately mingled, and is therefore in the best condition to com bine with the lime in the formation of a cement.

When arragonite is heated, it falls to powder. It is phosphorescent on red hot iron, and soluble with effervescence in nitric and muriatic acids. The most common repositories of arragonite are beds of gypsum, beds of iron ore, (where it occurs in coralloidal forms, and is denominated fos-ferri, 'flower of iron'), ba- salt, and trap rock ; occasionally, it occurs in lavas. It is often associated with copper and iron pyrites, galena, and malachite. This mineral was first discovered in Arragon, Spain, (whence its name), at Molina and Valencia, near Migranilla, in six-sided prisms, with gypsum, imbedded in a ferrugi- nous clay. It has since been obtained in compound hexagonal prisms at Bilin, in Bohe- mia, in a vein traversing basalt ; at Brisgau in Baden ; at Baumgarten and Tarnowitz in Silesia ; at Leogang in Salzburg, Austria ; in Waltsch, Bohemia, and many other places. The fos-ferri variety is found in great perfection in the Styrian mines, coating cavities and even caves of considerable extent, and associated with 6pathic iron. At Dufton, a silky, fibrous variety, called satin spar, occurs traversing shale in thin veins, generally asso- ciated with pyrites. In Buckinghamshire, Devonshire, <fec, it occurs in stalactitic forms in caverns, and of snowy whiteness at Leadhills in Lanarkshire. The variety tarnowitzite (analysis 7 above) corresponds to plumbocalcite under calcite. Kersten found in an- other specimen 219 of carbonate of lead. Arragonite and carbonate of lead are isomor- phous. 27"], [226, "210 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Flos-ferri occurs sparingly at Lockport, N. Y, coating gypsum in geodes; at Eden ville, N. Y lining cavities of mispickel and cube ore ; at the Parish ore bed, Rossie, N. Y. ; and at Haddam,\u00b0Conn., in thin seams between layers of gneiss.

Guyton Morveau found 14 per cent, of silica in the magnesite of Castellamonte. Dissolves slowly, with little effervescence, in nitric or dilute sulphuric acid ; infusible before the blowpipe. Magnesite is found with serpentine and other magnesian rocks. It occurs at Hrub schitz in Moravia, at the Gulsen mountains in Styria, at Baumgarten in SUesia, at Bau dissero in Piedmont, and at Valecas in Spain. At Hoboken, N. J., it occupies seams and cavities in dolomite and serpentine, having a closely aggregated fibrous structure ; also at Bolton, Mass., where it appears in delicate, indistinctly fibrous masses, traversing white limestone ; at Lynnfield, Mass., coating ser pentine ; at Barehills, near Baltimore, Md. ; in Pennsylvania, cryst. at W. Goshen, Ches ter Co., and near Texas, Lancaster Co. Carbonate of magnesia combines in various proportions with the carbonates of lime, of iron, of manganese ; with carbonate of lime it forms dolomite, with carbonate of iron mesitine spar, with carbonate of manganese oligon spar ; and there are many intermedi ate compounds.

Soluble in the acids, but more slowly than calcite. B.B. acts like calcite ; some varie ties darken and increase in hardness. A variety resembling Gurhofite is found on Hustis's farm, Phillipstown, N. Y. It has a semi-opaline appearance, and a fracture nearly like porcelain. The name Dolomite is applied to white crystals, and to the granular varieties. Pearl spar includes rhombohedral crystallizations with curved faces and a pearly lustre. When the crystals are not curved, and have a brown or reddish-brown color, they are called Brown spar : this variety contains 5 to 10 per cent, of oxyd of iron or oxyd of manganese. A nkerite contains still more iron. Gurhofite is a compact snow-white sub translucent variety, so named from a locality of it at Gurhof, in Lower Austria,, Granular dolomite constitutes extensive beds in various regions. Crystalline and compact varieties are often associated with serpentine and other magnesian rocks. Pearl spar occurs in geodes in compact limestones and other stratified rocks. Rhomb spar is"], [228, "212 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. found in Salzburg, the Tyrol, and at Miemo in Tuscany, whence the name Miemite was de rived. Brown spar and pearl spar are obtained at Schemnitz in Hungary, Kapnik in Transylvania, at Freiburg in Saxony, in the lead mines of Alston in Derbyshire, and at other places in Devonshire. The ankerite is from Styria and elsewhere. Roxbury, Vt., affords large yellow transparent crystals of the rhomb spar variety, im bedded in talc. A coarse cleavable variety, occasionally presenting perfect crystals, is associated with white talc in calc spar, at Smithfield, R. I. The pearl spar variety is abundant in geodes at Lockport. Niagara Falls, and Rochester, N. Y, accompanying calc spar, celestine, and gypsum; also at Glen's Falls. Massive dolomite forms extensive bed9 in Litchfield Co., Conn., in the southwestern towns of Massachusetts, in Vermont, in various parts of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Ac. Crystallized dolomite occurs in rhombohedrons at the quarantine, Richmond Co., N. Y., and at Hobo ken, N. J. Brown spar occurs at Warwick, N. Y. and at the Parish ore bed, St. Law rence County, N. Y. Dolomite is generally supposed to be injurious as a manure for soils, on account of its magnesia ; but this is not so, unless used after calcination, before it is fully air-slaked. The lime it affords when burnt, makes a more durable cement than common limestone. The rock is generally less firm or more friable than pure granular limestone, and there fore not as good for building stone. This species was named in honor of Dolomieu. BREUNNERITE, Haid.

B.B. infusible alone except on the edges ; gives the test of phosphoric acid, (p. 165). With biphosphate of soda or borax, fuses without difficulty to a glass, which, on cooling, has a crystalline structure ; also fuses if mixed with carbonate of iron ; dissolves slowly in nitric acid, without effervescence. Some varieties are phosphorescent. Apatite usually occurs in crystalline rocks. It is often found in veins in gneiss or mica slate, and particularly those containing tin and iron ore ; also in granular limestone. It is sometimes met with in serpentine, and occasionally, as in Spain, in ancient volcanic rocks. Among foreign localities are Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony ; Schlackenwald in Bohe mia ; Caldbeck Fell in Cumberland, Devonshire ; St. Gothard in Switzerland. The greenish-blue variety, called moroxite, occurs at Arendal in Norway, and Pargas, Fin land. The asparagus stone or spargelstein variety, which is obtained at ZUlerthal in the Tyrol, and Villa Rica, Spain, is translucent, and has a wine-yellow color ; it is imbedded in talc. The phosphorite or massive radiated varieties are mostly obtained from Estre madura in Spain, and Schlackenwald in Bohemia. Eupyrchroite of Emmons is similar. Magnificent crystals of apatite are found in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., in white lime stone, along with scapolite, sphene, &c. One crystal from Robinson's farm, in Hammond, was nearly a foot in length, and weighed 18 pounds. Smaller crystals are abundant, and the prisms are frequently well terminated. Besides the locality in Hammond, fine crys tals are obtained about a mile southeast of Gouverneur, in a similar gangue, and also in Rossie, with sphene and pyroxene, two miles north of the village of Oxbow. Also on the bank of Vrooman lake, Jefferson Co., in white limestone, fine green prisms from half to five inches long; Sanford mine, East Moriah, Essex Co., in magnetic iron ore, which is often thickly studded with six-sided prisms ; also at Long Pond, Essex Co. ; near Edenville, Orange Co., in prisms from half an inch to 1 2 inches long, of a bright asparagus-green color, imbedded in white limestone ; and in the same region, blue, gray ish-green, and grayish-white crystals ; two miles south of Amity, emerald and bluish green crystals ; at Long Pond, Essex Co., with garnet and idocrase ; at Greenfield, Sara toga Co., St. Anthony's Nose, and Corlaer's Hook, less interesting; fibrous mammillated (Eupyrchroite) at Crown Point, Essex Co., about a mile south of Hammondsville. In New Hampshire, crystals, often large, are abundant in the south part of Westmoreland, four miles south of the north village meeting-house, occupying a vein of feldspar and quartz in mica slate, along with molybdenite ; some fine crystals at Piermont, N. H., in white limestone, on the land of Mr. Thomas Cross. In Maine, on Long Island, Blue-hill Bay, in veins ten inches wide, intersecting granite. In Massachusetts, crystals occasionally six inches long, are obtained at Norwich, (northwest part), in gray quartz ; at Bolton abundant, the forms seldom interesting ; also sparingly at Chesterfield, Chester, Stur bridge, Hinsdale, and Williamsburgh. In Pennsylvania, at Leiperville, Delaware Co.; in Bucks Co., three miles west of Attleboro. Apatite has also been found near Baltimore, Maryland; at Dixon's quarry, Wilmington, Delaware, of a rich blue color; on the Morris canal, near Suckasung, N. J., of a brown color, in massive magnetic pyrites ; also at Perth, Canada. Apatite was named by Werner from airoraw, to deceive, in allusion to the mistake of the older mineralogists with regard to the nature of its many varieties. The Pseudoapatite of Breithaupt is considered by Rammelsberg an earthy variety of apatite. TALC-APATITE, Hermann, 3. f. pr.

In the north of England, it is the gangue of the lead veins, which intersect the coal formations of Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham, and York shire. In Derbyshire, it is abundant ; and also in Cornwall, where the veins intersect much older rocks. It is a common mineral in the mining districts of Saxony. In the dolomites of St. Gothard it occurs in pink octahedrons ; and at Munsterthal in Ba den in flesh-red hexakisoctahedrons. It has been detected in cannel coal by Prof. Rogers. The most remarkable locality of fluor spar in the United States, was discovered on the borders of Muscalonge lake, in Jefferson Co., N. Y., where cubical crystals, some of them more than a foot through, and having a greenish tinge, occur in granular lime stone. Rossie and Johnsburgh, St. Lawrence county, have afforded some fine crystals of fluor. In Gallatin county, Illinois, for thirty miles along the Ohio, in the region south west of Cone's Rock, at Shawneetown, and other places, a dark purple fluor, often in large crystals, occurs through the soil, or in limestone. At the north village of Westmore land, N. H., two mdes south of the meeting house, of white, green, and purple shades, con stituting a vein with quartz ; also, sparingly, at the Notch in the White Mountains, green octahedrons in a crystalline quartz. Some fine veins have been discovered on Long Island, Blue Hill Bay, Maine. It also occurs sparingly of a green color at Putney, Vt. ; in Shenandoah county, Virginia, near Woodstock, in the fissures of a limestone ; on the Potomac, at Shepardstown, in white limestone ; in Smith county, Tennessee, in white and purple cubes ; at Lockport, N. Y., in white cubes with celestine in limestone ; in cubes near Rochester and Manlius in limestone ; at Amity, N. Y., in thin seams with spinel and tourmaline ; at the Southampton lead mine in Massachusetts ; and near the Franklin Furnace, New Jersey. The variety chlorophane forms two veins in gneiss, each about 18 inches wide, in the town of Trumbull, Conn., along with topaz and magnetic pyrites. HAYESINE. Borate of lime, A. A. Hayes.

Pure alumina (XI) is the mineral or gem sapphire, corundum, or emery. Combined with water it forms the hydrates, diaspore and gibbsite ; with sulphuric acid it gives rise to several sulphates ; and combinations of a sulphate (SIS3) with a sulphate of potash, soda, magnesia, or some other allied base (fig) and 24 parts of water (24fi) produce a series of alums, crystallizing alike in octahedral forms. It also unites with phosphoric acid ; and its metallic base combined with fluorine, forms, along with sodium, the minerals cryolite and chiolite. Its most common mode of occurrence is in combination with silica, it entering into the composition of much the larger part of the silicates. The zeolites, feldspars, micas, garnet, tour maline, kyanite, andalusite, beryl, euclase, topaz, and numerous other spe cies contain it as an essential ingredient ; and it occurs occasionally in hornblende and in some other magnesian species. Combined with mag nesia, protoxyd of zinc, iron, or manganese, it produces a series of spinels having in common an octahedral form ; with glucina it forms chryso beryl. It is the characterizing ingredient of clay, and of many hydrous species like halloysite. Being isomorphous with peroxyd of iron, (3Pe), it is often replaced by this base ; consequently there is a phosphate of iron resembling phosphate of alumina ; and many of the aluminous silicates vary widely in charac ter from a more or less general substitution of one base for the other. Per oxyd of manganese (Mn) also performs to some extent the same part in replacement; and so also zirconia (Zr) and peroxyd of cerium, (^e). Alu mina also has been supposed to replace silica, as in some varieties of hornblende, where the presence of alumina is attended with a diminution of the proportion of silica. Owing to the relation of Al and 3Pe there are spinels in which the alumi na is replaced partly by peroxyd of iron. And magnetic iron, franklinite as well as chromic iron, belong to the same series.

Friction excites electricity, and in polished specimens the electrical attraction continues for a considerable length of time. The species sapphire includes corundum and emery, in addition to the finely colored varieties that have always borne this name. Corundum includes the gray arid darker colored opaque crystallized specimens, or cleavably massive ; emery, massive varieties of dingy color. The red sapphire is sometimes called the Oriental ruby ; the yellow, topaz ; the green, emerald ; violet, amethyst ; and hair-brown, adamantine spar. The asteriated crystals are often called asteria, a name used by Pliny. This species is associated with crystalline rocks, as granular limestone or dolomite, gneiss, granite, mica slate, chlorite slate. The fine sapphires are usually found in the beds of rivers, either in modified hexagonal prisms, or in rolled masses, accompanied by grains of magnetic iron ore, and several species of gems. The best ruby sapphires occur in the Capelan mountains, near Syrian, a city of Pegu, and in the kingdom of Ava : smaller individuals occur near Bilin and Merowitz in Bohe mia, and in the sand of the Expaillie river in Auvergne. Blue sapphires are brought from Ceylon ; this variety was called Salamstein by Werner. Corundum occurs in the Carnatic, on the Malabar coast, in the territories of Ava, and elsewhere in the East Indies; also near Canton, China. At St. Gothard it occurs of a red or blue tinge in dolomite, and near Mozzo in Piedmont, in white compact feldspar. Adamantine spar is met with in large coarse hexagonal pyramids on the Malabar coast, and in Gellivara, Sweden. Emery is found in large boulders at Naxos, and several of the Grecian islands.' Also in Asia Mi nor, 12 miles east of Ephesus, near Gummuchkeny, where it was discovered in situ by Dr. J. Lawrence Smith, associated with emeryhte and other micas, oxyds of iron, chlori toid, pyrites, and calc spar, between Eskihissar and Melas, as seen by Tchihatch'eff, and also to the north of Smyrna. Other localities are in Bohemia, near Petschau, in the Ural near Katherinenburg, and in the Tlmen mountains, not far from Miask. A fine blue variety of sapphire occurs at Newton, N. J., with hornblende, mica, feld spar, and tourmaline, connected with an extensive bed of granular limestone.'

A blue mass ive corundum, affording broad cleavage surfaces, is abundant in large masses in Rutherford Co., North Carolina ; and a fine red sapphire has been obtained in Chester Co., Georgia. Perth, Canada, also affords this species. The red sapphire is more highly esteemed than other varieties of this species. A crystal weighing four carats, perfect in transparency and color, has been valued at half the price of a diamond of the same size. They seldom exceed half an inch in length. Two splendid red crystals, however, having the form of the scalene dodecahedron, and \" de la longueur du petit doigt,\" with a diameter of about an inch, are said to be in the possession of the king of Arracan. Blue sapphires occur of larger size. According to Allan, Sir Abram Hume possesses a distinct crystal, which is three inches in length ; and in Mr. Hope's collection of precious stones there is one crystal, formerly the property of the Jardin des Plantes, for which he gave \u00a33000 sterling. The sapphire admits of the highest degree of polish. It is cut by means of diamond dust, and polished on copper or lead wheels with the powder of emery. It is used for jewelling watches, and has been cut into lenses. The applications of emery are well known. The word sapphire is from the Greek caTfctpos, the name of a blue stone, highly val ued by the ancients. This does not however appear to have been the sapphire of the present day, but the lapis lazuli, which more nearly agrees with the character given it by Theophrastus, Pliny, Isidorus, and others. The latter remarks, \" Sapphirus c\u0153ruleus est cum purpura, habens pulveres aureos sparsos,\" particles of hon pyrites, which are very frequently disseminated through lapis lazuli, looking like gold.

The green Oriental turquoisaf forded Hermann only 564 per cent, of phosphoric acid, and is evidently a mechanical mixture, containing but little turquois. Berzelius obtained in his analysis, phosphate of alumina, phosphate of lime, silica, oxyd of iron, and copper. In the matrass decrepitates violently, and yields water. B.B. in the reducing flame becomes brown, and colors it green, but infusible ; fuses readily, with borax or salt of phosphorus to a transparent glass, which on cooling is faint copper green in the outer flame, and cloudy-red in the inner, especially if tin be added. Insoluble in muriatic acid, and may thus be distinguished from other species called by the name of Turquois. This species occurs in a mountainous district in Persia, not far from Nichabour. Ac cording to Agaphi, the only naturalist who has visited the locality, turquois occurs only in veins which traverse the mountains in all directions. It receives a fine polish, and is valued for ornamental purposes ; and when finely col ored, is highly esteemed as a gem. The Persian king is said to retain for his own use all the larger and finely tinted specimens. The occidental or bone turquois is said to be phosphate of lime colored with oxyd of copper. Pliny remarks concerning the Callais, which appears to be identical with the turquois, that it occurred of a pale-green color, (e viridi pallens), and that its finest color was eme rald. He states that its form was usually round, and also the fable that it was found in Asia projecting from the surface of inaccessible rocks, whence it was obtained by means of slings.

A few minute crystals (the eremite of Shepard) were found in a boulder of albitic granite, containing also a few minute zir cons and tourmalines, in the northeastern part of Watertown, Ct. Good crystals are obtained with the sillimanite of Yorktown, Westchester Co., N. Y. ; also near Crowder's Mountain, N. C. The crystal affording the author the above angles (fig. 3) was a fine one with pol ished faces, well calculated for accurate measurements. Hermann gives the angle M : M 92\u00b0 30' ; Breithaupt 94\u00b0 85' ; Descloiseaux 93\u00b0. Monazitoid, Hermann, J. f. pr. Chem. xl, 21. This mineral is nothing but monazite in crystallization and external characters. Hermann states that the brown color is distinct ; but the author has seen monazites of this color.

The excess is owing as supposed, to a change of the protoxyd of cerium to peroxyd. Soluble in concentrated sulphuric acid. Not altered by a moderate calcination. Occurs in the green and red apatite of Arendal and distinguished on putting the apa tite in dilute nitric acid ; constitutes 2 or 3 per cent, of the mass ; it was found espe cially in the red apatite or in reddish points of the green, and associated with particles of magnetic iron, hornblende and another cerium ore of a hyacinth-red color. This mineral was looked for in the yellowish apatites of Snarum without success. Named from KpvTTTog, concealed. Phosphoceeite, H. Watts, Quart. J. Chem. Soc. July 1, 1849, ii, 131. The phospho cerite, as recognized by Mr. Watts, has the composition essentially of the cryptolite, but appears to differ in crystalline form. According to Watts and Chapman, (loc. cit. p. 154), the form is probably dimetric ; yet as the crystals of both this species and the cryptolite are microscopic, the two, as observed by Chapman, may yet be brought together. They occur as a grayish-yellow powder along with the cobalt ore of Tunaberg, and are asso ciated with dark purple crystals of another kind and dodecahedral form, (FesS4), which are strongly magnetic. The crystalline forms most common in the powder, are an octahe dron and a square or rectangular prism, terminating in a four-sided pyramid parallel with the lateral planes, resembling fig. 1, under zircon.

With the three fluxes, the Finbo mineral behaves like fluor spar ; the glass is however yellow in the oxydating flame as long as hot, and becomes opaque sooner than the glass given by fluor spar. In a pul verized state, it dissolves completely in heated muriatic acid, forming a yellow solution. It occurs sparingly at Finbo and Broddbo, near Fahlun in Sweden, imbedded in quartz, and associated with albite and topaz. Also at Amity, Orange Co., N. Y. ; and in Mass. probably Worcester Co. The Amity mineral has been recently examined by J. E. Teschemacher. An examination of the Massachusetts mineral by Dr. C. T. Jackson (Proc Bost Soc N.

I. SILICA. Silica in a pure state is the very abundant mineral quartz, which with its varieties constitutes a large part of the surface rocks of our globe. It occurs in various combinations, with the bases, magnesia, alumina, lime, oxyds of iron and manganese, glucina, zirconia, and rarely with oxyd of copper, of zinc, of bismuth, or of cerium ; and in some aluminous or ferruginous silicates, it is united with potash, soda, lithia, baryta, strontia, yttria, or thoria. With titanic acid and lime, it forms the mineral sphene ; with boracic acid and lime, the mineral datholite ; and with fluorine and alumina the mineral topaz. Fluorine and boracic acid occur sparingly also in certain other silicates. For the blowpipe tests of silica, see page 162 QUARTZ. Flint. Silex. Chalcedony. Cacholong. Agate. Jasper. Hornstone.

The varieties arise either from crystallization, mode of formation, or impurities; and are naturally distributed into three series. (1st), presenting the bright glassy lustre of broken quartz crystal; (2d), presenting the glistening subvitreous or waxy lustre, and translucency, or subtransparency of Chalcedony ; (3d), with the nearly dull lustre, dull colors, and opacity of Jasper. 1 The vitreous varieties. Rock crystal includes pure crystals of quartz. This stone, when cut for jewelry, is called \"white stone.\" Amethyst is a clear purple or bluish-violet variety of quartz crystal. The color is supposed to be due to a small percentage of oxyd of manganese. But Heintz, in an analysis of a Brazilian specimen, obtained, besides silica, 0'0187 oxyd of iron, 0-0236 limp, 0-0133 magnesia, and 0'0418 soda; and he considers the color owing to a com pound of iron and 6oda. Rose quartz has a rose-red or pink color, and is transparent, or nearly so. It becomes very pale on exposure to the light. The specimens are usually massive, often of large size, and much cracked, with the usual vitreous fracture of quartz. The lustre is some times a little greasy. The color is attributed by Fuchs to oxyd of titanium, who de tected 1 to 1| per cent, in specimens from Rabenstein, near Bodenmais. Berthier states that the color is due to organic matter. It more probably arises from manganese, the color being similar to that of manganese spar. False topaz is a light yellow pellucid variety of quartz crystal. It resembles yel low topaz, but is distinguished by its crystalline form, and the absence of cleavage. Smoky quartz, or Cairngorm stone, has a brownish smoky tint. The crystals are often pellucid ; but occasionally the color is so deep as to render them nearly opaque, except in thin fragments. Milky quartz, as the name implies, has a milk-wbite color. It is a massive vitreous variety, and one of the most common. It has sometimes a greasy lustre, and is then called greasy quartz. 31"], [258, "242 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Prase is a leek-green variety of massive quartz. Aventurine quartz is minutely spangled throughout the mass with yellow scales. It is usually translucent, and of a gray, brown, or reddish-brown color. Siderite. An indigo or Berlin-blue variety, from Golling, near Saltzburg. Ferruginous quartz is of an opaque red, brownish-red, or ochre yellow color, which is due to oxyd of iron. It occurs in distinct crystals ; the crystals are sometimes minute and aggregated into masses, like the grains of sand in sandstone. II. Chalcedonic varieties. Chalcedony has usually the subdued lustre of wax, and is either translucent or sub- transparent ; some milk-white varieties are opaque. It occurs in mammillary and botry- oidal shapes ; also as stalactites, in cavities lined or roofed with chalcedony. According to Fuchs, it is true quartz with some opal (or hydrated silica) disseminated through it. Chrysoprase. An apple, or leek-green variety of chalcedony ; it is colored by nickel. Cornelian. A reddish variety of chalcedony, generally of a clear bright tint. It passes into common chalcedony through grayisb-red varieties. Turpin has stated that the color is owing to a minute species of vegetation, (Protococcus kermesinus), which was disseminated through the chalcedony, while it was in a gelatinous state. But Heintz found no carbon, and his analysis shows that the color is due to oxyd of iron ; he found peroxyd of iron 0'050 per cent., alumina 0'081, magnesia 0'028, potash 0-0043, soda 0-075. Sard is a deep brownish-red chalcedony, of a blood-red color by transmitted light. Agate is a variegated chalcedony. The colors are distributed in clouds, spots, or bands. When in bands, the agate consists of parallel or concentric layers of chalcedony of different colors, arranged often with the utmost delicacy and beauty. These concen- tric lines may occur in straight, circular, or zigzag forms. The latter are called fortifica- tion agates, from a resemblance to the angular outlines of a fortification. In other agates the colors are owing to foreign matter disseminated through the mass. Moss agate or Mocha stone is a chalcedony containing within dendritic, or moss-like delineations of an opaque brownish-yellow color, which are due to oxyd of iron. Onyx. Resembles agate, but the colors are arranged in flat horizontal planes. They are usually a light clear brown, and an opaque white. When the layers consist of sard and white chalcedony, the stone is called sardonyx. Cat's eye. A translucent chalcedony, presenting a peculiar opalescence, or glaring in ternal reflections, when cut en cabochon, which effect is owing to filaments of asbestus. The color is commonly light greenish-gray \u2014 sometimes yellow, red, or brownish. Flint. Somewhat allied to chalcedony, but is more opaque, and presents dull colors, usually gray, smoky-brown, and brownish-black. The exterior is often whitish, from mixture with lime or chalk, in which it is imbedded. The lustre is barely glistening, subvitreous. It breaks with a deeply conchoidal fracture and a sharp cutting edge. The flint of the chalk formation consists largely of the remains of infusoria, sponges, and other marine productions, as is developed by a high magnifying power. The silica of flint, according to Fuchs, is partly soluble silica, easUy taken up by a solution of potash. There i3 usually a per cent, or so of alumina and peroxyd of iron, with one or two of water. Hornstone. Resembles flint, but is more brittle, and the fracture is more splintery. Chert is a term often applied to hornstone, and to any impure flinty rock, including the jaspers. Plasma. A faintly translucent chalcedony, approaching jasper, having a greenish color sprinkled with yellow and whitish dots, and a glistening lustre. III. Jaspery varieties. Jasper. A dull red, yellow, brown, or green siliceous rock, compact, nearly or quite opaque, and presenting little beauty untU polished. Besides the colors mentioned, there are also blue and black varieties. When the colors are arranged in stripes or bands it constitutes the Striped or Riband Jasper. Egyptian Jasper is zoned with colors, and forms nodules. Porcelain Jasper is nothing but baked clay, and differs from true jasper in being fusible on the edges before the blowpipe. Red porphyry often resembles jasper, but is nearly pure feldspar, and is also somewhat fusible. Blood stone or Heliotrope has a deep green color, and contains interspersed, blood-red spots, like drops of blood Lydian stone, Touclistone, or Basanite is a velvet black siliceous stone or flinty jasper, used on account of its hardness and black color for trying the purity of the precious' metals. The color left on the stone after rubbing the metal across it, indicates to the ex perienced eye the amount of alloy. Besides the above, there is a light spongy variety of quartz, called foot stone\u2014quartz"], [259, "SILICA. 243 neclique of Haiiy \u2014 which is so light as to float on water. It consists of fibres or fila- mentary crystals, aggregated into a spongy or porous mass. Siliceous sinter is a light cellular quartz. This term is also applied to a similar variety of opaL Tabular quartz consists of thin plates, either arranged parallel, or crossing one another and leaving open cells. Granular quartz is a massive quartz rock, of a granular texture. Its colors are va- rious, always dull. Silicified wood is wood petrified by silica or quartz. It has usually the structure of the original wood. A delicate fibrous quartz occurs at Orange river, near the Cape of Good Hope. Haytorite is a name given to pseudomorphous quartz having the form of Datholite. Quartz, in some of its varieties, occurs in almost every rock-stratum. It is an essen- tial constituent of granite, gneiss, and mica slate, and other allied rocks. The chalce- donic varieties occur principally in the vesicular cavities of trap, or basaltic rocks. Flint occurs imbedded in chalk. Hornstone is sometimes found in limestone. Jasper is asso- ciated with limestone like hornstone, and also with basaltic rocks and porphyry. Switzerland, Dauphiny, Piedmont, the Carrara quarries, and numerous other foreign localities, afford fine specimens of rock crystal. The most beautiful amethysts are brought from India, Ceylon, and Persia, where they occur in geodes, and as pebbles ; inferior specimens occur in Transylvania, in large crystalline groups ; in the vicinity of Cork, and on the island of May, in Ireland. The false topaz is met with in Brazd. Rose quartz occurs in a vein of manganese, traversing the granite of Rabenstein, near Zwiesel, in Bavaria. Prase is'found in the iron mines of Breitenbrunn, near Schwartzenberg, in Saxony. The amygdaloids of Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, afford magnificent speci- mens of Chalcedony ,- also Huttenberg and Loben in Carinthia, &c. A small blue varie- ty, in cubical crystals, (pseudomorphs of fluor), occurs at Treszytan, in Transylvania. The finest carnelians and agates are found in Arabia, India, Surinam, and Saxony. Perth- shire, and other parts of Scotland, afford smaller, but handsome specimens. Chrysoprase occurs at Kosemutz in Silesia. A venturine quartz, at Cape de Gata in Spain. Cat's eye, in Ceylon, the coast of Malabar, and also in the Hartz and Bavaria. Plasma, in India and China, whence it is usually brought in the form of beads. Heliotrope, in Bucharia, Tartary, Siberia, and the island of Rum in the Hebrides. Float stone, in the chalk for- mation of Mend Montant, near Paris, and in some of the Cornish mines. The banks of the Nile afford the Egyptian jasper ; the striped jasper is met with in Siberia, Saxony, and Devonshire. A fine yellow jasper is found at Vourla, bay of Smyrna, in a low ridge of limestone, to the right of the watering place, between the harbor and the high hills that commence their rise about a mile back. It is here associated with a handsome opal, coarse carnelians, chrysoprase, and hornstone, and these minerals seem to occupy in the limestone the place of hornstone, which is found in various parts of the adjoining country, and also at Napoli di Romania, in Greece. The plains of Argos are strewn with peb- bles of red jasper. A variety of sandstone occurs in thin layers at Villa Rica, Brazil, remarkable for its flexibility, owing apparently to the dissemination of small scales of mica through the mass ; a similar flexible sandstone occurs in the North Carolina gold regioa Quartz crystals are abundant in Herkimer Co., N. Y., at Middlefield, Little Falls, Sal- isbury, and Newport. They he loose in cavities in the calciferous sand-rock, or imbedded in loose earth, and sometimes, according to Beck, in powdered anthracite. Fine dodecahe- dral crystals are obtained at the beds of specular iron in Fowler, Hermon, and Edwards, St. Lawrence Co., New York. In Gouverneur, crystals occur with tourmaline, Ac, in limestone, which have rounded angles as if they had been partially fused. On the banks of Laidlaw lake, Rossie, there are large implanted crystals. The Sterling ore bed, Ant- werp, Jefferson Co., affords interesting dodecahedral crystals. Four miles east of War wick, crystals presenting the primary form occur in jasper. At Palatine, Montgomery Co., crystals occur having one end terminated with the usual pyramid, while the other is rounded and smooth. Diamond Rock, near Lansingburgh, is an old but poor locality. At Diamond Island and Diamond Point, Lake George, quartz crystals occur, as in Herkimer Co. Crystals with unusual modifications occur sparingly at the Charlestown syenite quarry, Mass. Pelham and Chesterfield, Mass., Paris and Perry, Me., and Meadow Mount, Mi, are other localities of quartz crystals. At Chesterfield, small unpolished rhombohe drons have been found in granite ; and Paris, Me., affords handsome crystals of brown or smoky quartz. Drusy quartz, of brown, apple-green, and other tints, is abundant at New fane, Vt. For other localities, see the catalogue of localities in the latter part of this volume. Rose quartz occurs at Albany, and Paris, Me., Acworth, N. H., Williamsburg, Mass., Southbury, Conn., and Port Henry, Essex Co., N. Y. ; smoky quartz at Goshen, Mass.,"], [260, "244 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Richmond Co., N. Y., Ac; amethyst in trap at Keweena Point, Pic Bay, and Gargontwa, on Lake Superior ; also in the same rock at Bristol, Rhode Island, and sparingly through out the trap region of Massachusetts and Connecticut ; in Pennsylvania in East Bradford, Aston, Chester, and Providence, (one fine crystal over 7 pounds in weight), in Chester Co. Crystallized green quartz occurs in talc, at Providence, Delaware Co., Penn. Chalcedony and agates of moderate beauty are found in the same trap region ; more abundantly about Lake Superior, the Mississippi, and the streams to the west, at Natural Bridge, Jefferson Co., N. Y. ; about the Willamet, Columbia, and other rivers in Oregon. Bel mont's lead mine, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y, has afforded fine specimens of chalcedony and chrysoprase, associated with calc spar. Red jasper is found on Sugar Loaf Mt., Maine, and in pebbles on the banks of the Hudson at Troy. Yellow jasper occurs with chal cedony at Chester, Mass. Heliotrope occupies veins in slate at Bloomingrove, Orange Co., N. Y. Pseudomorphs, imitative of hexagonal and scalenohedral crystals of calcareous spar and cubic crystals of fluor, occur at West Hampton, Mass. Petrified wood consists often of quartz, and sometimes of chalcedony or agate, of rare beauty. Quartz crystals occasionally occur of enormous size. A group in the museum of the university at Naples, weighs nearly half a ton. A crystal, belonging to Sig. Rafelli of Milan, measures three and a quarter feet in length, and five and a half in circumference, and its weight is estimated at eight hundred and seventy pounds ; another at Paris is three feet hi diameter, and weighs eight hundred weight. About a century since, a drusy cavity was opened at Zinken, which afforded 1000 cwt. of rock crystals, and at that early period brought $300,000. One crystal weighed 800 pounds. A group from New Hamp shire at Dartmouth College weighs 1474. pounds, and four of the crystals are from 6 to 54 inches in diameter. Crystals often exhibit very beautiful internal irridescences, owing to fissures or frac tures. This effect may be produced by heating the crystal and plunging it, while hot, into cold water. Foreign substances frequently penetrate or thoroughly permeate crystals of quartz. Iron has already been alluded to as one of these permeating substances. Chlo rite is sometimes so thoroughly intermingled, that the crystals appear to be composed entirely of this material; their hardness, however, shows their siliceous nature. Anthra cite, asbestus, actinolite, rutile, tourmaline, silver, and copper are other penetrating sub stances. Specimens containing acicular crystals of rutUe are often very beautiful. The most interesting of the substances occurring in quartz are the fluids, which occupy small cavities in the interior of crystals ; they are either water, peculiar resinous liquids, (page 83), or mineral solutions. Mr. Allan describes a crystal of amethyst in his collection, having four cavities partly filled with a bituminous fluid ; at 83\u00b0 F., the fluid ddates and fills all the cavities, and on cooling, reappears with ebullition. Silica is held in solution in the hot waters of the Geysers of Iceland, whose solvent powers are supposed to be due to their temperature, and a small quantity of alkali pres ent. The Geysers have covered the part of Iceland in their vicinity with a siliceous sinter. Several varieties of this species have long been employed in jewelry. The amethyst has always been esteemed for its beauty. Like most other stones, it is less brilliant by candle light ; it appears to best advantage when surrounded with pearls and set in gold. The color of the amethyst is often irregularly diffused, as is well dsscribed by Pliny, \" ad viciniam crystalli descendet albicante purpur\u00e6 defectu,\" purple, gradually fading into white. It was called amethyst, aiiidvuTos, on account of its pretended preservative pow ers against intoxication, from a, not, and ptflvo, to intoxicate. This is not, however, the only amethyst of the ancients. The violet colored sapphire, the violet fluor spar, (scalp turis faciles, Plin. easily graven), and some other purple species, were designated by the same name ; and it has been supposed that garnet wa6 also included. Cameos are in general made of onyx, which is well fitted for this kind of miniature sculpture. The figure is carved out of one layer, and stands in relief on another of dif ferent color. The most noted of the ancient cameos, is the Mantuan vase at Brunswick. It was cut from a single stone, and has the form of a cream pot, about seven inches high and two and a half broad ; on its outside, which is of a brown color, there are white and yellow groups of raised figures, representing Ceres and Triptolemus in search of Proser pine. The Museo Borbonico, at Naples, contains an onyx measuring eleven inches by nine, representing the apotheosis of Augustus, and another exhibiting the apotheosis of Ptolemy on one side, and the head of Medusa on the other ; both are splendid specimens of the art, and tbe former is supposed to be the largest in existence. The carnelian (sarda of Pliny) receives a fine polish, and is often rich in color; but is too common to be much esteemed. When first obtained from the rock, carnelians are"], [261, "SILICA. 245 usually gray or grayish-red ; they receive their fine colors from an exposure of several weeks to the sun's rays, and a subsequent heating in earthen pots. The colors of agate, when indistinct, may be brought out by boiling in oil, and afterwards in sulphuric acid ; the latter carbonizes the od absorbed by the apparently porous layers, and thus increases the contrast of the different colors. Agate is often made into mortars for chemical and pharmaceutical preparations, and according to Pliny, it was employed for the same pur pose by the physicians of his day. In Germany it is made into cups and plates. The royal collection at Dresden contains a table service of German agate ; and at Vienna, in the imperial cabinet, there is an oval dish twenty-two inches in length, formed from a single stone. The agate, or achates of the Greeks, was so called from the river Achates, in Sicily, whence, according to Theophrastus, these stones were originally brought, las pachates corresponded to our jasper agate ; Sardach-ates contained layers of the sard, or carnelian ; Dendi achates (from Uvifm, a tree, and achates) was moss agate ; H\u0153machates (from a, pa, blood, and achates) was an agate, sprinkled with spots of red jasper, (Moore's An. Min.). Jasper admits of a brilliant polish, and is often formed into vases, boxes, knife-handles, Ac. It is also extensively used in the manufacture of Florentine mosaics. The iaspis of the ancients, whence our word jasper is derived, appears to have included the green or blue colored variety, together with some other stones, not of the jasper kind. Quartz is a necessary ingredient in the manufacture of glass and porcelain, and is often employed in the smelting of ores, and in other metallurgical operations. With lime it forms mortar. The uses of flint are well known. Quartz is distinguished by its Hardness, \u2014 Scratching glass with facility. Infusibility, \u2014 Not fusing before the blowpipe. Insolubility, \u2014 Not attacked by water or the acids. Uncleavability. \u2014 One variety is tabular, but proper cleavago is never distinctly observed. To these characteristics the action of soda may be added. OPAL. Hyalite. .Muller's Glass. Hydrophane. Menilite. Cacholong. Siliceous Sinter. Pearl Sinter. Fiorite. Girasol. Eisenopal, Haus.

Color white, yellow, red, brown, green, gray, gene rally pale ; dark colors arise from foreign admixtures. Some speci mens exhibit a rich play of colors ; others present different colors by refracted and reflected light. The play of colors is destroyed by heat. There are many varieties of this species. The precious opal exhibits a play of rich colors. Fire opal or girasol presents bright hyacinth-red and yellow reflections. Com mon opal and semi-opal are common varieties not exhibiting the opalescence of the pre cious or fire opal ; they are distinguished from one another by their degrees of transpar ency and lustre. Hydrophane is not transparent, but becomes so when immersed in water. Cacholong is nearly opaque, and of a porcelain or bluish-white color ; it adheres to the tongue, and contains a small portion of alumina. It is closely allied to hydrophane, and often associated with it. Hyalite, or Muller's glass, occurs in small reniform, botry oidal, and occasionally stalactitic shapes, either colorless and pellucid, or white. Meni lite is a brown, opaque variety, occuring in compact reniform masses, occasionally pre senting a slaty structure. Opal jasper contains several percent, of iron, and is the ana logue in this species of the jasper in the preceding. Silicious sinter is a loose sdicious aggregate, deposited by ihe Geysers of Iceland, where it presents porous stalactitic, fibrous, \" cauliflower-like,\" and occasionally compact concretions, called geyserite by Da mour. Pearl sinter, or fiorite, occurs in the cavities of volcanic tufa, in smooth and shi ning globular and botryoidal masses, which have a pearly lustre.

B.B. opal is infusible, but gives out water and becomes opaque. Some varieties con taining iron turn red. Opal occurs in short irregular veins in porphyry ; also in the vesicular cavities of amyg daloid. Common opal sometimes occurs in hmestone, with hornstone. Menilite is met with in clay slate. Some varieties are found with galena and blende, in metalliferous reins. It also occupies the interior of fossils in sandstone. The precious opal occurs in porphyry at Czerwenitza, near Cashau in Hungary at Frankfort, and at Gracias a Dios in Honduras, S. A. Fire opal is brought from Zimapan"], [263, "LIME MAGNESIA. 247 in Mexico, and from the Faroe Islands. The common opal exists abundantly in Hunga ry, in Faroe, Iceland, the Giants' Causeway, and the Hebrides. An interesting variety occurs within a half mde, and to the southwest of the watering place at Vourla, the harbor of Smyrna, along with yellow jasper and hornstone, imbedded in a low ridge of compact limestone, of a light yellow or grayish-white color. Its colors are wax-yellow and grayish-green, occasionally white. Hungary affords also the hydrophane. The Gi ants' Causeway affords small masses resembling mountain cork, which though opaque, become translucent on immersion in water. Cacholong occurs in loose masses on the river Cach, in Bucharia, whence its name. Hyalite occurs in amygdaloid at Schemnitz, in Hun gary, and in clinkstone at Waltsch, in Bohemia. Menilite is found imbedded in adhesive slate, at Menil Montant, near Paris. Wood opal forms large trees in the pumice conglome rates of Saiba, near Neusohl, and Kremnitz in Hungary, in Faroe, near Hobart Town, Tasmania, and other trap countries. The Randanite is abundant near Algiers, and was taken for Kaolin ; also at Ceyssat, near Randan in the Puy de Dome. Hyalite occurs in the United States, sparingly at the Phillips ore bed, Putnam Co., N. Y., in thin coatings on granite ; also in Burke and Scriven Cos., Georgia. In the latter region it lines cavities in a siliceous shell-rock. The Suanna spring in Florida, affords small quantities of siliceous sinter. Good fire-opal is obtained in Washington Co., Ga. The precious opal, when large, and exhibiting its peculiar play of colors in perfection, is a gem of high value. It is cut with a convex surface. The largest mass of which we have any knowledge, is in the imperial cabinet of Vienna ; it has almost the size of a man's fist, and weighs 17 ounces, but contains numerous fissures, and is not entirely dis engaged from the matrix. This stone was used as a gem by the Greeks and Romans, and was called opalus ; ateo pcederos, iraiScpus, in allusion to its color and lustre, as expressed in the Orphic poem, ipcprov ripcva xP6a Ha>iis, \" having the delicate complexion of a lovely youth,\" (Moore's An.

Oc curs also at Dalecarlia, Sweden ; in the Tyrol, near Frombach ; Orawicza, Hungary ; near Nertschinsk, Siberia ; in New Holland ; and at the Valencian Mines, Mexico. In America it has been found at Peter's Point and Partridge Island, in the Basin of Mines, Nova Scotia. It here occurs both massive and crystallized, presenting white, red dish, and greenish colors, and is associated with laumonite, thomsonite, and other min erals of trap rocks.

It is also found at Gin Cove, near Perry, Maine, with prehnite and analcime in amygdaloid ; at the Cliff Mine, Michigan. Apophyllite was so named in allusion to its tendency to exfoliate under the blowpipe, from airo and 0i>AAov, a leaf.

Dissolves readily with borax to a clear glass, and leaves a siliceous skel eton with salt of phosphorus. With cobalt solution affords a blue glass. Dissolves readdy and gelatinizes with nitric acid. Datholite is found in amygdaloid and gneiss ; sometimes also in beds of iron ore in primitive rocks. In the latter situation both varieties are fouud at Arendal in Norway. The best European locality is in the Hartz. The variety Humboldtite, which was institu ted as a distinct species by Levy, occurs in agate balls at the Seisser Alp, in the Tyrol, and at Sonthofen, Bavaria. Datholite is met with also in the valley of Glen Farg, Perthshire and Salisburg Craigs ; at Uto, Sweden ; near Wolfstein in the Bavarian Rhine.

Talc and the Hydrous Silicates of Magnesia. The hydrous silicates of magnesia, to a large extent, have a soapy feel and low degrees of hardness, with very difficult fusibility. Some of the species are distinctly foliated in structure, and thus approach the micas among the aluminous silicates. The mineral talc, one of the foliated spe cies, appears to be at times anhydrous, and often hydrous ; notwithstanding this difference in its varieties, it is retained in this division on account of its close relations to other soapy species, here included.

With borax it intumesces, and forms a clear glass, sometimes colored with iron. Not attacked by the acids. This species is very generally diffused, and in some of its varieties, especially common talc, potstone, and steatite, forms extensive beds in regions of crystalline rocks, tfhich often contain rhomb spar, dolomite, (var. bitter spar J, magnetic iron, and actinolite. Apple-green talc occurs in the island of Unst, one of the Shetland isles ; also in the Greiner mountain in Saltzburg, and in the Vallais. Other foreign localities of potstone are, the Vallais and Grisons, and Waid, in Styria. Extensive beds of steatite occur in various parts of the New England States, also in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, &c. A bed at Smithfield, R. I., affords a delicate green col umnar variety of talc, and a primitive limestone iu the same region, a white granular va riety. At Bridgewater, Vt., handsome green talc occurs, intermingled with a transparent massive dolomite ; also at Dexter, Me. ; Lockwood, Newton, and Sparta, N. J., near Amity, N. Y. ; on Staten Island, both common and indurated, near the. quarantine'; and four miles distant it occurs in detached masses made up of folia, of a snow-white color (Beck) ; at Cooptown, Md., of green, blue, and rose color ; in South Mountain, ten miles south of Carlisle, Penn. ; in Texas, Nottingham, and Unionville, Penn. Steatite occurs in Vermont at Athens or Grafton, Westfield, Marlboro and Newfane \u2022 m New Hampshire at Francestown, Pelham, Orford, Keene, and Richmond \u25a0 in Massachu setts at Middlefield, Windsor, Blanford, Andover, and Chester.

The Meerschaum of Taberg and Sala, Sweden, is a soft earthy serpentine. Rhodo chrome (see under Kammererite) may be nothing but a chromiferous serpentine. The Marmolite according to Hermann, differs in containing more water as well as m its foliated structure, and gives the formula Mg3Si,1+2Mgfl2=Mg5Siafl4. As serpentine is to a great extent a metamorphic rock, the aualyses must be expected to disagree, and every portion of alumina orwater present, cannot in all cases be assumed to be an essential constituent. . Serpentine yields water in a matrass. B.B. on charcoal, fuses on the edges with diffi culty. Dissolves readily in borax ; with effervescence in salt of phosphorus. Gives usu ally an iron reaction. Soluble in muriatic and sulphuric acid. Serpentine often constitutes mountain masses. Mixed with carbonate of lime, it forms verd antique marble , which occurs often in extensive beds. Chromic hon is often dissem inated through it, giving it a mottled appearance, somewhat simdar to the 6kin of a snake, whence the name serpentine or ophite. Crystals of serpentine occur in the Fassa valley, Tyrol ; in the Ural at Auschkal, Bar sowka, Katharinenberg, and elsewhere ; in Norway at Snarum. Fine precious serpen tines come from Fahlun and Gulsjo in Sweden, the Isle of Man, the neighborhood of Portsoy in Aberdeenshire, Corsica, Siberia, and Saxony. Common serpentine occurs at Lizard's Point in Cornwall, and many other places. In the United States, precious serpentine of a light-green color occurs at PhiUipstown, in the Highlands, N. Y. ; also at Port Henry, Essex Co. ; at Antwerp, Jefferson Co., in crystals ; at Syracuse, east of Major Burnet's, interesting varieties ; in Gouverneur, St. Lawrence Co., in crystals, and also in Rossie, two miles north of Somerville ; at JohnB burg in Warren Co. ; Davenport's Neck, Westchester Co., affording fine cabinet speci mens ; in Cornwall, Monroe, and Warwick, Orange Co., sometimes in large crystals at Warwick ; and from Richmond to New Brighton, Richmond County.

Serpentine admits of a high polish, and may be turned in a lathe, and is sometimes employed as a material for ornaments, vases, boxes, &c. At Zoblitz in Saxony, Bayreuth, and in Franconia, several hundred persons are employed hi this manufacture. Verd an tique marble is clouded with green of various shades, and is a beautiful material for table and ornamental in-door work. Exposed to the weather it wears uneven, owing to its un equal hardness, and soon loses its polished surface. Serpentine may be used for the manufacture of epsom salt. Metaxite, Breithaupt, Plattner.

These different varieties afford very nearly the same atomic volume ; calculating it as explained in the American Journal of Science, vol. ix, 1850. B.B. the whitish or pale varieties fuse with some effervescence to a colorless glass ; with borax afford a clear glass. Varieties containing iron afford an hon reaction, which is more intense the greater the proportion. The Hedenbergite and dark augites fuse reachly to a shining black glass. Diallage yields some water in a matrass, and becomes of a paler color. On charcoal it fuses with difficulty on the edges to a gray slag. With borax it forms a glass colored with iron. Bronzite becomes of a paler color, but alone is infusible. Hypersthene generally fuses on charcoal rather easdy to a grayish-green glass, not clear. Hudsonite fuses with effervescence to a black magnetic bead ; with soda, a manganese reaction. Pyroxene is principally confined to crystalline or volcanic rocks, and is associated at different localities with granite, granular limestone, serpentine, greenstone, basalt, or lavas. Diallage occurs generally in serpentine or greenstone rocks ; and hypersthene with feldspar and quartz forms hypersthene rock, which occurs extensively in some districts of crystalline rocks. Foreign localities are numerous and hardly need mention. Augite occurs at Aussig and Teplitz, in Bohemia, in large crystals imbedded in basalt ; and in small highly polished crystals in the lavas of Vesuvius, with nepheline, idocrase, and mica. Diopside is met with in crystals at Ala, in Piedmont, associated with garnets and talc in veins traversing serpentine. Its more transparent crystals from this locality are sometimes polished and worn as gems. Sahlite is met with in granitic rocks at Sahla, and elsewhere. Baikalite occurs principally on the borders of Lake Baikal. Omphazite accompanies granular garnet at the Sau Alp, in Carinthia, and near Hof, in Bayreuth, with the smaragdite variety of hornblende, which it much resembles. White subtransparent crystals are met with at Bytown, Lower Canada, in limestone, often measuring an inch by one and a half inches. White flattened prismatic crystals) two or three inches long by one or two in breadth, occur in dolomite at Canaan, Conn.; large green crystals in the limestone of Trumbull ; small transparent crystals with gran ular pyroxene, are found in Reading, Conn, on the turnpike near the line of Danbury. The Bolton quarries, Mass, afford good crystals. The dolomite of New York Co, N. Y, affords white crystals, often several inches long, where it crosses the island at it's north extremity, and also at the abandoned quarries at Kingsbridge, about 208th street. In Orange Co. there are interesting localities, affording, besides fine crystals, many of the mas sive varieties, from white to black colors, the former in limestone, the latter usually with magnetic iron. The most noted are that at Two- ponds, in Monroe, where it occurs in simple or grouped crystals, often of large size, and is associated with scapolite, zircon, and sphene in white limestone : another, half a mile east of Greenwood furnace, along with mica in limestone, where one crystal was obtained six inches long and ten in circumference \u25a0 and two and a half miles north of Edcnville, gray crystals of interesting forms. Near Amity and Fort Montgomery, are other good localities. Dark-green or black crystals occur in limestone a mile northwest of Edenville. In Putmau Co, near Patterson, grayish-white crystal are abundant, strewed over the surface and in limestone. In Westchester Co a white variety occurs at the Sing Sing quarries. Other good localities in New York are"], [287, "LIME MAGNESIA. 271 at Rogers's Rock, Lake George, crystallized, massive, and granular, (coccoiite,) of gray, green, and brown colors ; on the banks of Vrooman lake, near Oxbow ; in Diana, Lewis Co, in black crystals. Franklin, N. J, also affords good pyroxene. Massive varieties occur at most of the above mentioned localities. A beautiful green coccoiite occurs near Long Pond, Essex Co., N. Y., and a black coccoiite in Monroe, Orange Co, a mile west of Coffee's Hotel ; at Willsboro', N. Y, green coccoiite is associated with sphene and tabular spar. A beautiful lamellar variety of a dark -green and bronze color is abundant in the Forest of Dean, Orange Co, N. Y, along with black coccoiite ; and fine sahlite with coccoiite about three mdes southeast of Greenwood furnace. Diopside occurs on Hustis's farm, Phillipstown, N. Y, and in the Bolton limestone quarry. Raymond and Rumford, Maine, afford several of the massive varieties, diopside, sahlite, &c. At Berk shire, Mass, a white variety is abundant. A broad lamellar sahlite of a white color is found at Watertown, Conn, at the lime quarry near the Naugatuck, and a less interesting grayish-green variety at the verd antique quarries of Mdford and New Haven. Both crystals and granular pyroxene are found near Attleboro', Penn. Diopside occurs in Bumet's quarry, Pennsbury. Diallage occurs in serpentine in Westfield and Blanford, Mass, at Deer Isle, Maine, Cooptown, Harford Co, Md. Hypersthene is stated to occur in Essex Co, in much of the granite of that region, often associated with labradorite ; also near Wilmington, Delaware. But the mineral from these localities, although presenting the external characters of this variety, differ much from one another in composition, (analyses 31, 32), and still more from the foreign hypersthene, (analysis No. 34). The Hudsonite of Beck (analyses 21 and 22) occurs in a vein of quartz in Cornwall, Orange Co, N. Y. The Polyhte of Thomson may possibly come from the same locality ; Thomson attributes it to Hoboken, which Beck states must be an error. Pyroxene was thus named by Haiiy from np, fire, and iivos, strange, in allusion to its occurrence in lavas, where Haiiy conceived it did not belong, or was a stranger. Augite is from avyri, lustre. Crystals of this species have been obtained by fusion, and are not unfrequent, of a black color among the hon slags of Sweden. Mitscherlich and Beudant have formed white crystals by heating together sdica, lime, and magnesia. ACMITE, Haidinger. Akmit. Achmite.

It is there met with in crystals, nearly a foot long, imbedded in feldspar and quartz. They are often macled and bent, and are detached with difficulty, on account of their frangibility. The name of this species is derived from anym, a point, in allusion to the pointed ex tremities of the crystals. It has been improperly spelt achmite. The species is near augite in crystallization, but differs in composition. HORNBLENDE. Amphibole. Green diallage. Actinohte. Actinote. Tremolite. Calamite. Pargasite. Smaragdite. Asbestos, in part.

Isomorphism leads to the same variations of constitution in hornblende, as in pyroxene, and R may be either lime, magnesia, protoxyd of iron or manganese. Alumina replaces silica, in some varieties. The prominent varieties are the following : \u2014 Tremolite, Grammatite.\u2014 White, grayish, greenish, or yellowish- white specimens. The crystals are often in long slender blades, either distinct and traversing the gangue, or aggregated in columnar and radiated masses. G.=2'93. Transparent \u2014 translucent. Catamite is asparagus green in crystals. Raphilite is an asbestiform tremolite, as the author finds from the examination of specimens. Formula, CaSi-|-Mg3Si! \u2014 Silica 60'5, lime 124, magnesia 27-1. Actinolite, (Actinote. Strahlstein). Bright-green bladed crystals or columnar forms ; if in distinct crystals, glassy actinolite. The crystals are long, slender prisms, and break easily across the prism. The fibrous or radiated crystallizations are often named asbes tiform actinolite. The green color is owing to a small proportion of oxyd of iron, and on account of the hon present, the specific gravity of actinolite is above that of tremo lite, usually between 302 and 3-05. Anthophyllite. Fine columnar or made up of acicular fibres of brown or grayish brown color, often submetaUie. G.=2-94 \u2014 3'16. The cleavage affords prisms of 124\u00b0 30', like other varieties of hornblende. Formula, EeSi-|-Mg3Si2=Silica B8'8, magnesia 2634, protoxyd of iron 14-9. Asbestus, when of a white color or some light shade, is a fibrous variety of tremolite or actinolite. The fibres are often as fine as flax, and may be separated with the fingers. By traversing limestone or the gangue that contains it, it often gives an asbestiform ap pearance to large masses of the rock. The more delicate varieties, presenting the lustre of satin, are called amianthus. \u2014 The fibres of asbestus are sometimes so interlaced that the fibrous structure is not apparent ; this variety is called mountain leather and rock or mountain cork. The former occurs in flexible lamin\u00e6 or sheets, resembling leather, and the latter has the feel and nearly the texture of cork. Both are so light, owing to the loose interlacing of fibres, as to float on water. Pargasite. Pargasite, or Pargas hornblende, includes crystallized varieties of high lustre and rather dark shades of green ; it is also granular. Hornblende. The name hornblende, as originally applied, belonged only to the dark green and black varieties, whether in crystals or massive. It contains a larger proportion of iron and alumina, than either of the above varieties, and has a sp.gr. from 31 to 3'4. Carinthine is a hornblende (aluminous and ferruginous) from Carinthia. G.=3'127. Arfvedsonite. A black hornblende containing largely of iron and also soda, and, ac cording to Brooke, having M : M=l 23\u00b0 65'. Lustre vitreous, inclining to resinous. G.=3'44. Formula, NaSi+Fe3Si2=Sihca 50'34, protoxyd of iron 38-30, soda 1P36. \u00c6girine resembles black hornblende, and is considered an impure variety. Hornblende Rock and Amphibolite are names of rocks consisting of hornblende, and having a crystalline granular texture. Corneine is a compact hornblende rock of smooth fracture, extremely tough and sono rous when struck. The name is from the Latin for horn. Diastatite. A hornblende from Wermland, differing a degree, according to Breithaupt, in the angle of the prism from hornblende. G.=309 \u2014 37. Uralite has the cleavage structure and composition of hornblende, (anal. 24), though the external form of augite, and is considered a pseudomorph.

New York, iii, 50), referred by Shepard to Boltonite, is shown by B. Silliman, Jr. (Am. J. Sci., [2], viii, 391) to pertain probably to an actinolite from Bolton. The fluorine in many hornblendes is supposed to be combined as fluorid of calcium, and this ingredient, according to Bonsdorff, constitutes 1 part in 5 of the mineral. B.B. the tremolite and pale varieties, containing no iron, fuse readily with intumescence to a glass nearly transparent to mdk-white ; and with borax form transparent colorless glass. The lighter colored varieties containing iron, fuse alone with more or less difficulty to a dark yellowish glass, and with borax give a transparent glass, tinged with iron. The darker green varieties afford a deeper iron color. The hornblende, containing alumina and little hon, acts much like tremolite ; but the black varieties fuse to a brilliant black bead, and the borax glass is tinged with hon. Anthophyllite fuses with great difficulty to a glass colored by iroa Arfvedsonite fuses readily with intumescence to a black magnetic globule. The variety hornblende of this species is one of the constituents of syenite and green stone, as well as hornblende rock and slate. Tremolite is most common in dolomite and granular limestone. Hornblende also occurs in granular limestone and in trachyte. Actinolite is found in the greatest perfection in talcose rocks. Asbestus often traverses serpentine rocks and granular limestones. Aussig and Teplitz in Bohemia, Tunaberg in Sweden, and Pargas in Finland, afford fine specimens of the dark colored hornblendes. Actinolite occurs at Saltzburg and Greiner, in the Zillerthal ; Tremolite, at St. Gothard, in primitive limestones or dolomite, the Tyrol, the Bannat, Gulsjo in Sweden, &c. Catamite occurs at Normarken in Sweden, in prisms in serpentine. Asbestus is found in Savoy, Saltzburg, the Tyrol ; also in the island of Corsica, where it is so abundant that Dolomieu employed it in packing his min erals. Rock cork is obtained in Saxony, Portsoy, and Leadhills, where also mountain leather occurs. Oisans, in France, affords a variety of amianthus, composed of fibres having some degree of elasticity. It is the amianthoide of Haiiy. Anthophyllite comes from Kongsberg, Norway, <tc. Arfvedsonite was brought first from Greenland, where it is associated with sodalite. \u00c6girine is from the zircon syenite of Brevig, where it is associated with magnetic iron and thorite. Raphilite comes from the Lanark range, Canada. In the United States, black crystals of hornblende occur at Franconia, N. H. ; at Ches ter, Mass. ; at Thomaston, Me. ; at Moultonboro', Me, in Syenite ; at Willsboro', N. Y, presenting interesting crystalline forms ; also near the bridge at Potsdam, St. Lawrence Co, N. Y. ; near Greenwood Furnace, and in Warwick, Orange Co., N. Y. Interesting crystals of a dark green color occur near the Two Ponds, and also a mile north, two and a half mdes north, and a mile south of Edenville, together with gray or hair brown crystals and tremolite, sphene, and chondrodite, in granular limestone. Near Amity, hornblende occurs of various forms and colors, and often in large and perfect crystals ; in dark green crystals, with ilmenite, at the Stirling mines, Orange Co. ; at Gouverneur, in short green crystals, sometimes two or three inches in diameter, along with apatite ; in Rossie, two miles north of Oxbow, the variety pargasite in neat bright green crystals. Pargasite occurs also at Phipsburg and Parsonstield, Me. Gray hornblende in good crystals is found at Bryam, N. J, and other interesting varieties at Franklin and Newton of the same State. Large flattened crystals of a white color occur abundantly in dolomite at Canaan, Conn, between the falls and the post-office, and other places in Litchfield Co. ; also at Lee (one and a half miles southwest of the meeting house) and Newburg, Mass. Glassy actinolite in beautiful specimens occurs in the steatite quarries of Windham, Readsboro', and New Fane, Vt, and at Middlefield and Blanford, Mass. ; also near a hamlet called Pecksville, in Fi-hkill, N. Y. Radiated or asbestiform actinolite occurs at the same localities ; also at Unity, Me. ; at Brown's serpentine quarry, three miles northwest of Cannel, Putnam Co, N. Y. ; at Franklin, N. J. ; at Carlisle, Pelham, and Windsor, Mass. ; in Buckingham Co, Willis's Mt, Va. Other localities of actinolite occur in Pennsylvania, in Providence, Mineral Hill, Delaware Co.; at Unionville ; at Kennett, Chester Co, often in fine crystals. Radiated and asbestiform tremolite occurs abundantly in the dolomite of New England and New York ; the pr!n3ipal localities are at Thomaston and Raymond, Me. ; Lee and Great Barrington, Mass. ; in New York at Dover, Kingsbridge, the Eastchester quarries, at Hastings and near Yonkers in Westchester Co. ; at Knapp's quarry, Patterson, and on the banks of Yellow lake and elsewhere in St. Lawrence Co, N.

J. ; in Pennsylvania, at Chestnut Hill, near the Wihiccon ; near Philadelphia, at London Grove, Chester Co. ; at the Bare Hills, Md."], [292, "276 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Asbestus is met with at many of the above locahties, besides others ; at West Farms, Winchester, Wilton, and Milford, Conn. ; at Brighton, Sheffield, Pelham, Newbury, and Dedham, Mass. ; in New York, near Greenwood Furnace, Rogers's farm in Patterson, Colton rock and Hustis's farm in Phillipstown, (both asbestus and amianthus,) near the quarantine, Richmond Co, asbestus and a straw-colored amianthus with the fibres between two and three feet in length ; at Chesnut Hill, Penn. ; Cooptown and Bare Hills, Md. ; and Barnes's Mills, Fauquier Co, Virginia. Mountain leather occurs at the Milford quarries, Conn, also at Brunswick, New Jersey. A variety of hornblende, on the idand of Corsica, admits of a high polish, and is known to the Italian lapidaries under the name of Verde de Corsica duro. Asbestus was manu factured into cloth by the ancients, who were acquainted with its incombustibility. This cloth was sometimes the material for napkins, and was convenient for this purpose on ac count of the ease with which it was cleansed ; it was merely necessary to throw them into the fire. This material was also employed for the wicks of lamps in the ancient temples, and because it maintained a perpetual flame without being consumed, was named aaS^ros, (asbestus), unextinguished. It is now used for the same purpose by the natives of Greenland. The ancients also caUed it ap-iavros, (amiantus), undefiled, because of the simplicity of the means of restoring it, when soiled, to its original purity. The best U. S. locality for collecting it for this purpose is near the quarantine, Richmond Co, New York. It is extensively used in making safes. Hornblende was thus named in allusion to its extreme toughness ; in this respect slightly resembling horn. The radiating, or divergent structure, frequently presented by actinolite, suggested this name from drriv, a ray. Tremolite was first found at Tremola in Switzerland, and Pargasite, at Pargas in Finland.

Sci., viii, 59). \u2014 This mineral is probably nothing but a variety of hornblende, although the analysis by Muir favors a different conclusion. He obtained Si 56-543, Fe 31-669, Mn 7'802, Na 8-439, fl 3-178=97-631, whence Kobell derives the formula Na Si+3 (Fe, Mn) gi=(Na, Fe, Mn)Si.

Dufrdnov obtained Si 38-81, Al 9-31, Fe 45-83 Mg 413, Ca 0-67, fl 230. From Gedre\" in the Pyrenees. Note. \u2014 The union of augite and hornblende was proposed by M. Gustavus Rose in 1831 on the ground both of crystallization and composition. The crystalline forms of one were shown to be possible secondaries of the other, though unlike in cleavage, and the case of uralite was instanced as having the form of augite with the structure of hornblende. They are similar in their ingredients, and also in the range of varieties arising from isomorphism. But in more recent investigations, this distinguished chemist has shown that the species are properly distinct, their chemical formulas being in no way convertible, and the cleavage structure always different, except in certain cases at tributable to pseudomorphism. Notwithstanding the difference of constitution, it may be as Rose suggested, that the two are formed at different temperatures, or more probably under different rates of cooling. Augite occurs in lavas, and the more recent basalts which is not true of hornblende. BABINGTONITE, Levy, Ann.

No. 11 is a mineral from the Tyrol, affording the formula (Ca, Mg, Fe)3Si. Scacchi has detected a yellowish olivine in the limestone of Somma, having the formula (iCa+ \u2022jMgfSi ; it has the usual form, but inferior hardness. No. 9, Hyalosiderite is UMg-f -}Pe)3Si, with an excess of Mg3Si. No. 12 is the compound l5VSi=Silica 30*47, protoxyd of iron 69*53 ; it occurs as a volcanic glass at Vesuvius. Tlie obsidians are mixtures often approaching this composition. Fayalite (Eisenperidot) is one of this kind from Fayal, one of the Azores. . Such substances have nearly the same composition as the stony lava with which they are associated, being portions of the lava that have rapidly cooled and taken on a glassy form. Besides these varieties of chrysolite, tephroite (see under manganese) is a manganesian chrysolite, with the formula Mn'Si ; and Knebelite contains manganese and iron='$Mn-|-iFe)-lSi. With the fluxes gives the reaction of iron. Scarcely attacked by muriatic acid, but easily gelatinizes with sulphuric acid. (Berzelius says that it also forms a jelly with'mu riatic). Scacchi's Vesuvian variety is easily attacked by the acids. The iron chryso lites are fusible before the blowpipe."], [295, "279 LIME MAGNESIA. The olivine of meteorites has the same composition as above. That of the Pallas me teorite afforded Walmstedt : Si 40-83 Mg 47-74 Ee 11-53 Mn 0-29, with a trace of Oa and Al=100-39 ; and Berzelius detected in the same 0-17 of oxyd of zinc. Chrysolite and serpentine are isomorphous ; to compare the figures it should be noted that e of the figure above corresponds to e of serpentine. The perfectly crystallized chrysolite is brought from Constantinople : its locality is not known. Less distinct crystallizations occur imbedded in lava, at Vesuvius and the Isle of Bourbon ; imbedded in obsidian, at Real del Monte in Mexico ; among sand at ExpaiUie in Auvergne, in pale green transparent crystals. Olivine is more abundant, be ing of frequent occurrence in basalt and lavas. Crystals, several inches in length, occur in greenstone at Unkel, on the Rhine ; spheroidal masses are met with at Kapfenstein in Lower Styria ; and at Hecla and Vesuvius. Olivine is common in the lavas and basalt of the Sandwich and other Pacific Islands. It is a frequent ingredient of meteoric stones. Olivine is commonly very fragile and often filled with cavities, and is therefore unfit for an ornamental stone. Chrysolite, also, is usually too much intersected by flaws to be valued as a gem, and is so soft as to require the greatest care to retain its polish. The word chrysolite is derived from XPV\"0^, gold, and XiBas, stone, in allusion to its color. Glinkite is from talcose slate in Perm, district of Katherinenburg ; it is nothing but chrysolite, as shown by Beck. The minerals Chusite and Limbelite of Saussure, from the volcanic district of Limbourg, appear to be decomposed varieties of this species. In the first stages of decomposition chrysolite becomes iridescent ; it afterwards turns red and opaque, from the development of the hon it contains. Hyalosiderite, Walchner, (Schw. J. xxxix, 65), is a variety of this species. According to Walchner, it occurs in crystals of a yellowish or reddish-brown color in amygdaloid, in the Kaiserstuhl, near Sasbach in Brisgau. Its crystals are flat rectangular tables, with the terminal edges deeply replaced, e : e=99\u00b0 22' ; cinnamon-brown ; internal lustre vit reous, external submetallic ; subtranslucent. H=5'5.

Boltonite is disseminated through white limestone at Bolton, Mass, and also at Box borough and Littleton. Mr. Saemann attributes the change of color in boltonite to minute grains of magnetic iron disseminated in the substance of the crystals, which undergo change on exposure, and leave the mineral of a lighter color than it was when fresh. Thomson's bisilicate of magnesia, (Ann. Lye. Nat. Hist. N.

ALUMINA a. Hydrous compounds with Silica. Many of the following hydrous silicates of alumina have a clay-like aspect, and uncrystalline structure, and are therefore of doubtful title to the rank of species. Common clay is sometimes here included, though not properly a mineral. It consists of alumina and silica, besides water, and usually about one part of the former to two of the latter ; and there are often various other ingredients, as carbonate of lime, oxyd of iron in some state of combination, some magnesian compounds, &c. It owes its plasticity to the amount of alumina. Clay for pottery is a variety free from iron, an ingredient that gives the red color to bricks. Acids attack it but slightly, proving that the water present is not to any great amount in chem ical combination forming hydrous silicate of alumina. But there are clays containing water in combination : they are less plastic, easily attacked by acids, and yield in the fire ; and consequently in making pottery of them, they require a mixture with other earths. Such clays possess the property of combining with oil or grease, and are used in cleaning woollens, and are hence called Fuller's earth, (argiles smectiques, terre a foulon). The amount of water is 22 to 25 per cent. These clays are sometimes found in beds in limestone, and are a result, in part at least, of chemical deposition. Silesia affords a variety which is largely exported. The Halloysites are of this character, and properly the type of them. Kaolin or porcelain clay is a mixture of more or less free silica with a hydrous silicate of alu mina, resulting from the decomposition of a feldspar. A second division of the hydrous silicates includes some micaceous spe cies, as pyrophyllite and ottrelite related to mica in structure and appear ance, but differing in being hydrous. A third division embraces some species which have arisen from the alteration of anhydrous aluminous silicates and the attending absorption of water. These species, like fahlunite, are proper pseudomorphs ; the ex ternal form is that of the original unaltered mineral, and not that of the new species which has resulted from the alteration. A fourth division in this section contains the zeolites and allied species, \u2014 compounds of silica with alumina and some alkali or earth, (potash, soda, lime, baryta, or strontia) ; they occur crystallized, and usually in cavities or seams in rocks, though occasionally disseminated."], [299, "ALUMINA. 283 Many anhydrous silicates of alumina afford at times a small percentage of water. This water is generally considered either hygrometric or a re sult of a partial alteration like that producing the fahlunite series. The feldspars, micas, and many other species, are examples. Some chemists however consider the water a true constituent replacing part of the bases. PHOLERITE. In soft nacreous scales of a white color, massive H.=0-5\u2014 1.

Allophane occurs lining irregular cavities in a kind of marl, at Saalfield in Thuringia, at Schneeberg in Saxony, and elsewhere. The specimens analyzed by Berthier, occur abundantly in the chalk of Beauvais, France ; they present a honey-yellow color. It was first observed by Messrs. Riemann and Roepert, and hence has been called Rieman nite. The first analysis and description were made by Hoffmann and Stromeyer, in 1816. In the United States it occurs with gibbsite at Richmond, Mass., forming a hya line crust, scaly or compact in structure, and brittle. The name aUophane is derived from aXXos, otlier, and fyalvu, to appear, in allusion to its change of appearance under the blowpipe. PYRARGILLITE, Nordenskiold, Jahresb. 1833, 174.

Sci., vii, 1824, 55. \u2014 This mineral from Milbury, Mass, has hitherto been supposed to be related to pyrophylhte. But an analysis by Mr. Richard Crossley, (just completed wlule these pages were going through the press, and communicated to the author by Dr. C. T. Jackson, with a new description of the species,) shows that it has the composition of pyrosclerite, p. 263. Mr. Crossley obtained Si 35-74, Si 1642, Ee 10-02, Mg 27'44, fl 10-30=99-92, whence he deduces the oxygen ratio (approximately) 6:2:4:3, leading to the formula, 2(Mg, Ee)3Si+AlSi+44H=Sdica 37-7, alumina 13-9, magnesia 277, protoxyd of iron 9-8, water 109. The mineral is in scales or foliated grains disseminated through a mealy magnesian substance ; and Mr. Crossley carefully separated the two before com mencing the analysis, a precaution not taken by Dr. Thomson, who arrived at a very dif ferent result, (Min. 373). The characters of the species are given as follows by Dr. Jackson : Highly foliated. Scales not of distinct form, but probably hexagonal ; separate easdy into lamin\u00e6, which are flexible but not elastic. H. \u2014 1. G.=2756, Crossley, after drying. Color dark olive-green ; pale apple-green by transmitted light. Lustre pearly. Thin scales translucent to subtranslucent. B.B. a thin scale suddenly exfoliates (at 500 to 600 F) and swells out to a cylinder or vermicular thread nearly a hundred times its original length ; and if confined in a glass tube this expansion is so powerful as to break it, with an explosion, and scatter the glass to a distance. In the forceps a scale fuses readily to a yellowish-green glass ; with soda an opaque brown bead ; with borax or salt of phos phorus easdy a glass, yellow-whde hot and colorless when cold, or with the latter flux becoming somewhat milky-white on cooling. Decomposed by muriatic and sulphuric acids. In a matrass yields water which is somewhat alkaline. The mineral, as obtained in the mass, looks like a half decomposed steatite. If the silica and alumina may be considered as mutually replaceable in this mineral as in some augites and other species, we have quite exactly the formula 2R3 (Si, Al)2-)-4\u00a3fi Dr. Thomson obtained in his analysis, Si 49-080, Si 7-28, Mg 16-964, Pe 16-120, fl 10-276=99720.

The Bonsdorffite is from Abo. Esmarkite is from granite, near Breyig, Norway. Chlorophyllite occurs in very large prisms and tabular crystals at Neal's mine in Unity, N. H., along with iolite, the one graduating into the other ; and the same mineral, found under similar circumstances at Haddam, has been called Finite. Gi gantolite is met with in very large prisms at Tamela, Finland. Aspasiolite is from Kra geroe, Norway. Prascolite comes from Brakke near Brevig in Norway, and is associated with iolite, the two passing into one another. Weissite is from Fahlun, and is described as occuring in chlorite slate in small masses as large as hazlenuts. Tennant has analyzed a mineral of alhed constitution to the weissite from Canada East, (Ree. Gen. Sci. 1836, May, 332) ; it contained Si 55-05, Al 22-60, Mg 5-70, Ee 12-60, Mn trace, Ca 140, fl 2'25=99'60. It is doubtful whether this species has any real relations to the Weissite. In the changes undergone from nitrating waters or atmospheric agency some ingredi ents of the original mineral are often to a greater or less extent removed in solution, and we should not expect to find in all the iolite pseudomorphs the original elements of this mineral added to water ; the analyses show that they are not always present.

The zeolite family includes hydrous silicates of alumina and some alkali, either soda, potassa, baryta, strontia or lime. They intumesce in general before the blowpipe, and hence the name from \u00a3sw, to boil. They fuse easily, and yield a silica skeleton with salt of phosphorus. They are found crystallized, fibrous, or massive, in cavities or seams in various igneous rocks, especially amygdaloidal trap or basalt, and sometimes in sandstones, in the vicinity of these rocks, and occasionally in metalliferous veins.

Heulandite occurs principally in amygdaloidal rocks. Also in gneiss, and occasionally in metalliferous veins. The finest specimens of this species come from Iceland and the Faroe Islands, and from the Vendayah mountains in Hindostan. Red varieties occur at Campsie in Ster lingshire, with stilbite of the same color, and brown in ore beds, at Arendal. It also occurs in the Kilpatrick hills, near Glasgow. At Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, it occurs in trap, presenting white and flesh-red colors, and associated with laumonite, apophyllite, thomsonite, &c. ; also at Cape Blomidon, and other places in the same region, in crystals an inch and a half in length. In the United States it has been observed with stdbite and chabazite on gneiss, at Had lyme, Ct., and Chester, Mass., and with these minerals and datholite, apophyllite, <fcc., in amygdaloid at Bergen Hill, New Jersey ; also at Kipp's Bay, New York Island, on gneiss, along with stilbite ; in fine crystals on the north shore of Lake Superior at Prince's Mine ; and also between Pigeon Bay and Fond du Lac. Also in minute crystals, seldom over half a line long, with haydenite, at Jones's Falls, near Baltimore, on a syenitic schist, Levy has described these crystals, under the name of Beaumontite, as modified square prisms. The difference in the lustre of P and e, the two faces of the prism, shows that these planes are dissimdar, and that the form cannot be a square prism. In physical and other characters they resemble Heulandite, and the angle T : a, according to Levy, equals 147\u00b0 18', which is near the same angle in this species. Levy makes a : a= 132\u00b0 20'. Delesse's analysis afforded silica 64'2, alumina 141, protoxyd of iron P2, lime 4-8, magnesia 17, loss and soda 0'6, water 13-4; but it is probable that the speci men was not pure. G.=2-24, (Ann. Ch. Phys. [3], ix, 385). This species was named by Brooke in honor of Mr. Heuland, of London.

Occurs also at the Giant's Causeway, coating the cavities of amygdaloid ; in the lead mines of St. Turpet ; near Freiburg in the Brisgau ; in the department of the Isere in France, and in the Pyrenees.

Two specimens from Dumbarton, analyzed by Thomson, (Min. i, 345), approximate to hypostilbite. B.B. intumesces and yields a milk-white bead. With acids yields slimy sdica, except ing Beudant's sphierostilbite, which forms a jelly. Stdbite occurs mostly in cavities in amygdaloid or trap. It is also found in some me talliferous veins, and on granite and gneiss. Abundant on the Faroe Islands, in Iceland, and on the Isle of Skye, in trap ; at An dreasberg in the Hartz, and Kongsberg and Arendal in Norway, with iron ore ; in the Vendayah Mts., Hindostan, in large translucent crystals, having a reddish tinge ; in fine crystals, of a brick-red color, in porpliyritic amygdaloid, near Kilpatrick in Dumbarton shire ; a brown variety on granite, at the copper mines of Gustafsberg, near Fahlun in Sweden. At Partridge Island, at Nova Scotia, this species forms a perpendicular vein from three to four inches thick, and from thirty to fifty feet long, intersecting amygdaloid. Its colors are white and flesh-red. It is accompanied with wine-colored carbonate of lime. In the United States, occurs sparingly in small crystals at Chester and the Charles town syenite quarries, Mass. ; at the gneiss quarry, Thachersville, Conn., in crystals li ning cavities in coarse granite ; at Hadlyme in radiated forms on gneiss, associated with epidote, garnet, and apatite ; at Phillipstown, N. Y., in crystals or fan-like groups ; oppo site West Point, in a vein of decomposing bluish feldspar, intersecting gneiss, in honey yellow crystals ; in the greenstone of Piermont, N. T., in minute crystals ; in scopiform crystals of a dull yellow color, near Peekskdl, N. T. ; and at Bergen Hill, New Jersey, in small but bright crystals ; also at Kewenaw Point, Lake Superior, in trap. The name stdbite is derived from ariXIJri, lustre. Stilbite is easily distinguished from the preceding species, by its property of not ge latinizing with acids ; and from gypsum, which it sometimes resembles, by its superior hardness. EPISTILBITE, G.

This species exhibits but one system of rings in polarized light, according to Dr. Brews ter, while heulandite has two. The double refraction of heulandite is also much greater than that of epistilbite. Levy has however shown that the crystals of epistilbite may be modifications of heu landite ; for the angle M : M of the former equals nearly a : a in the latter.

The Lehuntite of Thomson contains 3ft, like the scolecites, although a soda-mesotype. B.B. natrolite becomes opaque and is often phosphorescent ; it fuses quietly to a glassy globule. Scolecite curls up like a worm, (whence the name from cicioXrit, a worm), and finally melts to a bulky shining slag, which in the inner flame becomes a vesicular slight ly translucent bead. Both varieties gelatinize readily with acids, and natrolite even after ignition. Scolecite is pyro-electric. This species occurs in cavities in amygdaloidal trap, basalt, and other alhed rocks ; and sometimes in seams in granite or gneiss. Natrolite occurs in the graustein of Aussig in Bohemia ; in Auvergne ; the trap rocks of Kilmalcolm in Renfrewshire, and Glenarm in the county of Antrim and elsewhere. The radiolite is from Brevig. Bergtnantiite is a red or white natrolite, from Zircon syenite near Brevig. Lehuntite is from Glenarm. Scolecite occurs at Tiegerhottue, in the Berufiord, Iceland, where the crystals often ex ceed two inches in length, and are occasionally a quarter of an inch thick. It has also been met with in amygdaloid, at the Faroe Islands, Staffa ; the Vendayah mountains, Hin dostan ; in Greenland ; and at Pargas, Finland ; also in veins in Kilpatrick hills. In North America, natrolite occurs in the trap of Nova Scotia; at Cheshire, Ct., sparingly ; at Washington, Ct. in seams between hornblende rock and gneiss ; at Bergen Hill, N.

The mineral is white or flesh-red, with at times some appearance of lami nation, and occurs in veins or masses in El\u00e6olite, from which it is separated by a portion hard and siliceous, and then a thin red layer, which is jasper-like in appearance. It gave the blowpipe and acid tests of scolecite. It appears to be mixed at times with apatite, massive or crystallized. A specimen of this character examined by Mr. G. J. Brush in the Yale Laboratory, afforded considerable phosphoric acid. A somewhat dif ferent specimen of a pure white color, associated with the Brookite (Arkansite) of the same locality, and closely zeohtic in appearance, with some acicular crystallizations, proved to be apatite in minute hexagonal prisms thickly aggregated and imbedded in an uncrystallized material of the same color, which was not sufficient in quantity for examination. Trials afforded scarcely any alumina. Shepard inferred from his trials that the ozarkite was a siliceous hydrate of lime and yttria, with possibly traces of thorina.

With borax forms a transparent globule. Gelatinizes with nitric or muriatic acids, but is not affected by sulphuric acid, unless heated. Laumonite occurs in the cavities of amygdaloid, also in porphyry and syenite, and occasionally in veins traversing clay slate with calcite. It was first observed in 1785. in the lead mines of Huelgoet in Brittany, by Gillet Laumont, after whom it is named. Its principal localities are at the Faroe Islands, Disko in Greenland, in Bohemia at Eule in clay slate, St. Gothard in Switzerland, the Fassa-thal in large masses exhibiting a radiated structure, Hartfield Moss in Renfrewshire, accompanying analcime, the amygda loidal rocks in the Kdpatrick hids near Glasgow, and in several trap rocks of the He brides, and the north of Ireland. Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, affords fine specimens of this species. It is there associated with apophyllite, thomsonite, and other species of this famfly. Good laumonite is obtained at Phipsburg, Maine, and the Charlestown quarries, Mass., in gneiss ; also at Bradleysvdle, Litchfield Co., Conn., near a paper-mill, in narrow seams in gneiss ; and at Southbury, Conn., a little east of the village, on the land of Mr. Stiles ; abundant' also at Kewenaw Pt, Lake Superior, in amygdaloid ; on north shore of Lake Superior, between Pigeon Bay and Fond du Lac ; at Bergen Hill, N J, in greenstone, with datholite, apophyllite, &c. ; sparingly at Phillipstown, N. Y., in feldspar with stilbite, and at Columbia bridge, near Philadelphia. The rapid change to which this mineral is exceedingly liable, may be prevented by dippin\" the specimen in a thin solution of gum Arabic, by means of which it is preserved from contact with the air. The change consists in a loss of 1 to 2 per cent, of hygroscopic water. By heat to 300\u00b0 cent, one half the water is expeUed, as ascertained by Malaguti and Durocher.

Comp tonite (shown by Rammelsberg to be thomsonite) is met with in the lavas of Vesuvius, in basalt at the Pflasterkaute in Saxe- Weimar, at Seeberg and elsewhere in Bohemia in the cavities of clinkstone, in the Cyclopean islands, Sicdy, with analcime and Phillipsite, and in Faroe. Long slender prismatic crystallizations of a grayish white color are obtained at Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, where it is associated with apophyllite, mesotype, laumonite, and other trap minerals. Chalilite of Thomson (Min. i, 324) may be an impure massive thomsonite. It contains Si 36-56, Al 26-20, Ca 10-28, Na 2-72, fl 1666, Pe 9-28=101-70.

Fracture vitreous, with no trace of cleavage, Damour. Fuses slowly to a white enamel. Attacked by acids, which leave a siliceous residue. It contains soda and potash in place of lime, and 15 A. The Acadiolite has the simple rhombohedral form of chabazite ; the color is red though passing into white. In some crystals it is arranged in a tesselated manner, the angles being nearly colorless. Chabazite occurs mostly in trap, basalt, or amygdaloid, and occasionally in gneiss, sye nite, and mica slate. Fine crystallizations occur at the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland, associated with chlorite and stilbite ; also at Aussig in Bohemia, in a kind of greenstone, (the graustein of Werner) ; at Annerode near Giessen ; also at the Giant's Causeway, Kdmalcolm, Ren frewshire, Isle of Skye, &c. In Nova Scotia it occurs in fine crystals, often highly modi fied, of a wine-yellow or flesh-red color, and is associated with heulandite, analcime, and calcareous spar. The variety Levyne occurs in trap at the little Deer Park of Glenarm, Scotland ; also at Skagastrand, Iceland ; at Dalsnypen, Faroe, with chabazite, analcime, and Heulandite ; at Godhavn, Disco Island, Greenland, and occasionally in large crystals at Hartfield Moss, in Renfrewshire. Gmelinite is found at Montecchio Maggiore and at Castel in the Vicentine, in the cavities of amygdaloidal rocks ; also in the county of An - trim, at the Deer Park of Glenarm, of a white color, and at the Island Magee, near Lame, of a pale flesh-red. Ledererite was obtained by Jackson and Alger at Cape Blomidon, Nova Scotia, where it occurs in basalt associated with stdbite, mesotype, and analcime ; the crystals are usually implanted on analcime or stdbite. Phacolite occurs at Leipa in Bohemia. Herschelite occurs in the cavities of trap, at Aci Reale near Catania, Sicily, along with Phillipsite. The crystals are generally aggregated in a manner similar to those of Prehnite. Acadiolite comes from Nova Scotia, where it was first procured by Jackson and Alger. Chabazite occurs both massive and crystallized at the Paugatuck stone-quarry, Stoning - ton, Conn., associated with scapolite, sphene, and apatite ; also of a yedowish-red color in North Killingworth, on the Essex turnpike ; at fiadlyme, Conn., on gneiss ; in syenite at Charlestown, Mass. ; also at Chester, Mass., in amygdaloid ; at Bergen Hid, N.

It occurs coating hornblendic gneiss in fissures at Jones' Falls, a mile and a half from Baltimore. The crystals seldom exceed a line in length, and are nearly rhombs in shape They are usually coated with a brownish-green hydrate or iron, which is easily separated and leaves the surface smooth and bright. Occasionally crystals are met with, consisting wholly of this hydrate of iron. The haydenite is associated with heulandite in minute crystals.

Prehnite was first found at the Cape of Good Hope by Colonel Prehn, after whom it was named by Werner. It has since been discovered at numerous places in Europe, in Asia, and America, in granite, gneiss, and trap rocks. At St. Christophe, in Dauphiny, it is associated with axinite and epidote ; it also oc curs in the Fassa valley, Tyrol, in Salzburg, at Friskie Hall and Campsie in Dumbarton shire, and at Hartfield Moss; in Renfrewshire, in veins traversing trap, associated with analcime and thomsonite ; also at Corstorphine Hill, the Castle and Salisbury Crag, near Edinburgh. In the United States, finely crystallized specimens have been obtained at Farmington, Woodbury, and Middletown, Conn., and West Springfield, Mass., and Patterson and Bergen Hill. N. J. It occurs in small quantities in gneiss, at BeUows Falls, Vt., and in syenite, at Charlestown, Mass., Mdk Row quarry, often in minute tabular crystals, asso ciated with chabazite ; also at Palmer (Three River) and Turner's Falls on the Connecti cut, Mass., in greenstone, and at Perry, above Loring's Cove, Maine ; on north shore of Lake Superior, between Pigeon Bay and Fond du Lac ; and in large veins at Kewenaw Point, Lake Superior, and often there including strings or leaves of native copper. Handsome polished slabs of this mineral have been cut from the masses brought from China. The Anhydrous Prehnite of Whitney (Bost. Jour. Nat. Hist. v. 487) is described as having the constitution of prehnite, without the water. It occurs massive and compact, with traces of a radiate or lamello-radiate texture in the mass.

This mineral has since been examined by Dr. C. T. Jackson, (as communicated to the author), who finds it to contain in two trials 47 and 4'15 per cent, of water ; and accord ing to an examination by Mr. G. J. Brush in the Yale Laboratory, the amount of water is 4\"865 per cent. The mineral appears therefore to be identical with ordinary prehnite. It occurs with wollastonite and chlorastrohte at Kewenaw Point and Isle Royale, Lake Superior, and is often implanted in the former of these minerals.

Xenolite is from Petershoff, in Finland. Kyamte, when blue and transparent, and in sufficiently large pieces, is employed as a gem, aud somewhat resembles sapphire. The name is from <>a\u00bb;, blue. The name sappare arose from a mistake by Saussure in reading a label of this mineral on which it was called sapphire. Sillimanite was named in honor of Prof. Silliman ; and bucholzite after Bucholz. The Monrohte of Sdliman, Jr. (see page 295) has a resemblance to kyamte, but contained a small percentage of water. Excluding the water, which we think should not be estimated, its constitution, as ascertained by Silliman, corresponds to Al\"Si4=Silica 41-85, alumina 5815.

The crystals have\" a tesselated appearance, as shown in the following figures, which are here copied from a memoir by Dr. C. T. Jackson, (Jour. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist, i, 55), in which the author proposes the union of andalusite and chiastolite in one species. The same had been previously suggested by F. S. Beudant, (Traite de Min. p. 156, 1824). The hy pothesis of Beudant, to account for these freaks in nature, appears to be the most con sistent with the appearances presented, that is, that they are simple crystals, with extra neous matter, regularly arranged by the process of crystallization. The irregularity of the whitish prisms, in the different parts of the same crystals, (figs, a and b, are from oppo site extremities of the same crystal ; so also c and d, and e and f ), appear to oppose the hypotheses of the compound nature of these crystals. The chemical constitution of this variety, as determined by Dr. Jackson, is sufficient to settle the question of their identity. Composition. \u2014 Al3Si2=Silica 375, alumina 625.

FELDSPAR FAMILY. The feldspar family includes a number of anhydrous silicates of alu mina and an alkali, presenting mostly clinometric crystallization, but also occurring monometric and hexagonal ; and if the scapolites and spodumene should be included which are related in composition and general aspect, a dtmetric and trimetric character must be added. The crystals of the clino metric feldspars are usually thick or tabular. The lustre ofthe species is vit reous or vitreo-pearly ; specific gravity between 2-4 and 2-9 ; hardness 5-5 \u2014 7 ; colors usually some light shade, and never black. Among the feldspars there are five cases of dimorphism. Orthoclase (or common feld-"], [337, "321 ALUMINA. spar) monoclinic, is dimorphous with albite triclinic ; loxoclase monoclinic, with oligoclase triclinic ; ryacolite monoclinic, with labradorite triclinic ; andesine triclinic, with leucite monometric. The crystals of the triclinic species, when placed with the corresponding planes in front, may incline to the right or to the left. Thus anorthite inclines to the right and lepolite to the left. This is the main point of distinction laid down for these two species ; for they are chemically alike, and make the fifth of the cases of dimorphism alluded to.

Nepheline and one Wernerite ; Anorthite and another Wernerite ; Vosgite and Barsowite ; Meionite and Couzeranite, are four other cases of dimorphism. Moreover Epidote has the formula of Meionite ; Acmite that of Oligoclase ; and Iolite that of Barsowite (and Bytownite), making (with that of Anorthite, Lepolite, and Wernerite) four cases of trimorphism. Abich, in his memoir on the true feldspars, (Pogg. Ii, 125, 341), shows that in all these species, as far as then ascertained, the relation between the oxygen of the protoxyds and peroxyds is as 1 to 3, (see table , divis ions 1 to 4 inclusive), and this point of union is the only one as regards proportion of constituents, which has seemed to be general. Deville ob serves, (Comptes Rendus, xx, 182), that in some of the species, the third term in the ratio is a multiple of 3, and in others, as leucite and andesine, a multiple of 4 : and he consequently divides the feldspars into two groups, the Feldspar and the Leucite groups, (\" Feldspathides\" and \" Amphige nides\"). But new species, since described, seem to require that on this ground other groups should be recognized. A true and fundamental relation based on atomic volume is shown on page 145 ; and this relation diminishes somewhat the seeming importance of the principles deduced by Abich and Delesse. On this new ground, petalite, in which the first ratio is 1 : 4, falls properly with the feldspars, where its crystallization and other characters would place it : while the other lithia species, spodumene, is, for the same reasons, (crystallographic as well as atomic volume), more closely related to andalusite. Dufrenoy writes for petalite the same formula essentially as for albite, and for spod umene, in like manner, the formula of oligoclase. The former (LiSi-f-Al Si3) gives only 73-7 per cent, of silica, in place of 77 or 78, which the analyses require, and there is a like discrepancy as regards the latter. Among the true feldspars the protoxyd bases are either potash, soda, lime or lithia, which in many species mutually replace one another. a. The potash species (which also include often some soda) are Com mon Feldspar or Orthoclase and Leucite. b. The soda species, or soda and potash, are Albite, Ryacolite, Oligo clase, Loxoclase, Nepheline. c. The soda and lime species, (containing also some potash,) Andesine Vosgite, Davyne. d. The lime species, Anorthite, Labradorite, Thiorsauite. e. The lithia species, Petalite. Magnesia also enters very sparingly into some of the species, and per oxyd of iron (Pe) sometimes replaces 1 or 2 per cent, of the alumina. LEUCITE, Werner. Amphigene, H. Monometric.

The Leucitic lava of the neighborhood of Rome has been used for the last two thou sand years at least, in the formation of mid-stones. Mill-stones of this rock have lately been discovered in the excavations at Pompeii. Leucite is derived from Xeukoj, white, in allusion to its color; and because its form is simdar to a common variety of garnet, it has been designated white garnet. NEPHELINE, D. Sommite, P.

Hunt, to be iden tical in composition with common feldspar, (Rep. Geol. Canada, 1849, 135). The Peris terite (Thomson) is also this species, as confirmed by Mr. Hunt. It is an iridescent variety. The feldspar of the Chilian Andes (analysis 10) contains largely of soda, as well as potash. Abich finds one or more per cent, of soda in all the feldspars analyzed by him. B.B. feldspar fuses with difficulty, and only on the edges, to a semi-transparent blebby glass. With borax it forms slowly a transparent glass, and with .soda slowly a vesicu lar glass. Not acted upon by the acids. With cobalt solution, becomes blue only on the fused edges. Difference of color and lustre has given rise to distinct names for several of the vari eties of this species. Common Feldipar includes the subtranslucent varieties, the common constituent of granite. Necronite is a variety of feldspar, which gives off a fetid odor when struck. Adularia is a transparent or translucent variety, found in granitic rocks. The crystals are often large, and occur of great perfection in the high districts of Savoy ; the name is derived from Adula, one of the highest peaks of St. Gothard. The Valencianite of Breithaupt is a variety of adularia. Moonstone is a variety of adularia, presenting, when polished, chatoyant or pearly reflections. Sunstone is a simdar variety, containing minute particles disseminated through it. The opalescence is seen only in the direction of a plane replacing the edge T : T somewhat obhquely. Aventurine Feldspar is leBS pellucid, and has yellow and reddish internal reflections."], [343, "327 ALUMINA. But neither of these are exclusively common feldspar. A Siberian sunstone has been shown by Scheerer to be oligoclase. Glassy Feldspar is a transparent variety found in trachytic and volcanic rocks, having a perfect vitreous lustre. The name Ice Spar is sometimes given to a similar variety found in Vesuvian lavas ; the term however includes pellucid varieties of other species of feldspar. Other varieties are the Murchisonite of Levy, which is a yellowish-gray variety from Dawlish and Arran ; Amazon stone, a verdigris-green variety colored by copper ; the Leelite of Dr. Clarke, (the Hellefiinta of the Swedes), which occurs at Gryphyttan in Sweden, with a peculiar waxy lustre, and deep flesh-red color ; and the Variolite, a dark green variety, containing lighter globular particles, from Drae river in France. Kaolin is a term applied to a clay resulting from the decomposition of feldspar. In the formation of Kaolin, the principal change consists in the removal of the alkali of the feldspar, with part of the silica, and the addition of water, (see page 287). The Microcline of Breithaupt is a variety of this species from Arendal, (Pogg. xlvii , 196). The Erythrite of Thomson (Phil. Mag. xxii, 188, 1843) is a flesh-colored feldspar containing three per cent, of magnesia, found in amygdaloid ; G.=2541. The Peris terite and Perthite of Thomson (Phil. Mag. xxii, 189) are from Perth in Upper Canada. Feldspar in fine crystals is found at Carlsbad and Elbogen in Bohemia. The twins, figs. 5, 6, are abundant at the former place, where they occur two to four inches in length, scattered over the fields, from the decomposition of the granite of the region. Ekatherinenburg in Siberia, Arendal in Norway, Baveno in Piedmont, Lomnitz in Sdesia, Land's End, &c., are other localities. At the Mourne mountains in Ireland, fine specimens occur, associated with beryl and topaz. Glassy feldspar occurs in great abundance in the trachyte of the Drachenfels on the Rhine ; also in the lavas which devastated the island of Ischia, near Naples, in 1302. Ice spar is found principally at Vesuvius : it may be obtained in profu sion in the valley caUed Fossa Grande. Fine crystallized feldspar occurs in New York, in St. Lawrence Co., at Rossie, two mdes north of Oxbow ; the crystals are white or bluish-white, neatly modified, and some times an inch across ; also eight miles from Potsdam, on the road to Pierremont, where crystals a foot through are said to have been found ; and near De Long's mill in the town of Hammond, with apatite and zircon ; in Lewis Co., feldspar occurs both crystallized and massive in white limestone near Natural Bridge, associated with scapolite and sphene ; in Orange Co., crystals presenting the primary form occur near West Point ; more abun dant and interesting forms are found at Rocky Hill, in Warwick, associated with tourma line and zircon ; and at Amity and Edenville. In Saratoga Co., N. Y., the Greenfield chrysoberyl locality affords white translucent crystals, which are usually coated with sd very mica. In Connecticut, the gneiss quarries of Haddam and the feldspar quarries of Middletown occasionally afford crystals a foot in length, and six or eight inches in thick ness ; near Bradleysville, in the western part of Litchfield, crystals two to three inches long are abundant. In Massachusetts at South Royalston and Barre, in interesting crys tals often of large size ; also at Three Rivers, in Palmer. The Acworth beryl locahty, the tourmaline locahty of Paris, Maine, are other localities of crystallized feldspar. In Pennsylvania, in crystals at Leiperville, Mineral Hill, and Chester, Delaware Co. ; chatoy ant (moonstone) and also aventurine, and a green variety, at Mineral Hdl ; a sunstone in Kennett Township ; fine crystals of green feldspar occur on the island, Mt. Dessert, Me. Massive feldspar irfibundant at the above mentioned localities, besides many others. An aventurine variety, with bright coppery reflections in spots, occurs at Leiperville, Pennsylvania. Adularia occurs at the iolite locahty at Haddam, at the Falls of the Yan tic, near Norwich, Conn., at Brimfield, Mass., with iolite, and at Parsonsfield, Me. ; and sunstone at Lyme, Conn. Kaolin occurs at Andover, Mass., and abundantly in New Mil ford, Kent, and Cornwall, Conn., and in the counties of Essex and Warren, New York ; also in New Garden, Chester Co., Pa., abundant. Necronite is found at Roger's Rock, Essex Co., and at Thomson's quarry, near 196th street, New York. Feldspar and the clay (Kaolin) resulting from its decomposition, are used in making pottery. Moonstone and sunstone are employed as gems. Feldspar enters into the composition of a great number of rocks. Granite consists of feldspar, quartz, and mica, crystallized promiscuously together. The feldspar constitutes ordinarily about 40 per cent., but varies very widely ; whde the quartz is usually 30 to 40 per cent. Ordinary granite contains about 72-3 silica, 15-3 alumina, 74 of alkalies, 50 of lime, magnesia, and oxyd of hon, \u2014 a composition near that of petrosilex. Pegmatite is graphic granite."], [344, "328 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Gneiss has the same ingredients as granite, but with traces of lamination. Mica slate is similar in constitution, with a distinctly foliated structure. Syenite consists of feldspar, hornblende, and quartz, and otherwise resembles granite. These rocks pass into one another by insensible gradations. Protogine is a talc granite. Granulite, Eurite, or Leptynite, (Weissstein), is a granular compound of feldspar and quartz. The Hornfels of the Germans is a massive compound of quartz and feldspar breaking with a smooth flinty fracture. Pyroxenite consists of feldspar and lamellar pyroxene. Porphyry consists of a compact feldspathic base, (cornite or porphyrite), with crystals of feldspar': \u00abit may be green with blotches of paler green or white, or red with white blotches or specks, besides other shades of color ; the blotches of a polished surface are the feldspar crystals. When distinct feldspar crystals are scattered through granite it is called porphyritic granite. The feldspar of porphyry is often the species labradorite, as is the case in the ancient verd antique porphyry of Greece, quarried from rounded hills on the plains of Helosin, Laconia. In the porphyry of Ternuay in the Vosges it is the species vosgite. Clinkstone or phonolite is a compact feldspathic rock of grayish colors and smooth fracture, clinking under the hammer when struck, somewhat like a metal. G.=2'5 \u2014 2-0. Trachyte is a rock of similar constitution and color with clinkstone, but having a rough surface of fracture. Domite is a variety from Puy-de Dome. Pumice (Bimsstein German) is a porous feldspathic scoria from volcanoes ; the pores are fine and linear and often barely visible without a glass. G.=2'2 \u2014 24 Trap or greenstone is a dark and heavy blackish-green or brownish rock, consisting of feldspar and hornblende ; it usually has a crystalline texture, but is sometimes compact. When albite. replaces the feldspar the rock is called diorite and diabase. Basalt is a similar rock consisting of feldspar (often labradorite) and augite, either subcrystalline or not at all so, and often containing distinct crystals of augite or feldspar or both, and still more frequently chrysolite in bottle-glass colored grains. It passes into lavas, which often have the same constitution and are of the same origin. When the feldspar in combination with augite is labradorite, the rock is called dolerite. Wacke is an earthy variety, or a rock consisting of basaltic earth or sand.* * In the analysis of basalt, it is subjected to the action of nitric or muriatic acid, and thus separated into a soluble and insoluble portion. The basalt of Wickenstein,thus ex amined by Lowe, with muriatic acid, afforded him 55'58 per cent, of insoluble product, and 4442 of soluble, the latter consisting of 39-81 of zeolite or zeolitic minerals, and 4'61 of magnetic iron. The basalt from Stolpen, according to Sinding, consists of 57736 per cent, soluble in muriatic acid, and 42264 insoluble.

According to Girard, who analyzed the same basalt with somewhat differ ent results, it is a mixture of mesolite and nepheline. The rest of the basalt, excluding the magnetic iron, is augite, and, according to Girard, the whole consists of mesotype 22-686, nepheline 22686, magnetic hon 6-370, augite 48-256. T'he Stolpen basalt is inferred from the analysis, to consist of zeolite 74-837, olivine 12-630, magnetic hon 13-318. The zeolite is supposed to be a mixture of several zeolitic minerals ; it approaches, in composition, mesole, brevicite, and sodalite. A Dolerite from Iceland, analyzed by Auerbach, gave labradorite 3818 per cent, and"], [345, "329 ALUMINA. Petrosilex (adinole, Beudant) is compact impure feldspar, like the base of porphyry. It differs from jasper, which it often resembles, in being fusible before the blowpipe. G.=2-606 \u2014 2-66. A greenish-gray specimen from Brittany afforded Berthier, Silica 754, alumina 155, potash 38, magnesia 14, oxyd of iron 1'2.

Obsidian or volcanic glass is sometimes an impure feldspar in a glassy state ; and in other cases it is a mixture of feldspar and augite with chrysolite and much iron, or of augite and chrysolite or labradorite, &c, the materials varying with the lavas of a volca no; for any lava will become glassy, and thus make obsidian, by rapid cooling.

The albite granites are often repositories of several of the granite minerals, tourmalines of different colors, beryls, allanite, <fec. It is associated with pearl spar in the Tyrol, where it occurs in large transparent crystals ; with epidote and garnet at Arendal ; with eudialyte and hornblende in Greenland. It is frequently one of the constituents of syenite and greenstone. Such is the case in the rocks about Ed inburgh. In Massachusetts, U. S., at Chesterfield, it occurs in lamellar masses, (Cleavelandite), having a slightly bluish tint ; also at the same locality finely granular, and rarely in small crystals, and containing red and blue tourmalines. It contains the same minerals at Paris, Maine, and at Goshen, Mass,, at Acworth and Alstead, N. H. At Haddam, Conn., it accompanies chrysoberyl, beryl, columbite, and black tourmalines. Fine trans parent or translucent crystallizations occur at the Middletown feldspar quarry. Gran viUe, Washington Co., N. Y., affords white transparent crystals. At Monroe, Conn., a fine granular variety occurs, containing beryl. In Delaware Co., Pennsylvania, at Unionville, a granular variety occurs as the matrix of the corundum, (see analyses 11 and 12), having the hardness of quartz, (7\u20147-25). It has been taken for Indianite. A simdar variety equally hard is found with Idocrase at Sandford, Maine. The name Albite is derived from albus, white, in allusion to its color, and was given the species by Galin and Berzelius in 1814. The variety from Chesterfield was denom inated Cleavelandite by Mr. Brooke, in honor of Prof. Cleaveland. OLIGOCLASE. Soda Spodumene. Natron-Spodumen, Berz. Triclinic.

Amphodelite is a reddish gray or dingy peach-blossom-red variety, occurring crystallized and massive, with the angle P : M=85\u00b0 40' and 94\u00b0 20', and cleavage parallel to P and M. Indianite has a granular texture something like statuary marble, a glistening sur face of fracture, and occurs massive. The grains cleave parallel to two planes inclined to one another 95\u00b0 15', which is not far from the angle of anorthite, considering the diffi culty in this case of obtaining perfectly accurate measurement. The Biotine of Monticelh is shown by Brooke to be this species, (Phil. Mag. x, 1837). The Christianite of Monticelh is referred here by Scacchi. Anorthite occurs at Mount Vesuvius, among the old lavas in the ravines of Monte Somma, associated with ice spar, augite, mica, and idocrase. Also on the island of Procida, near the entrance to the bay of Naples ; in the Faroe Islands, and Java. Amphodelite occurs at Lojo, Finland, and at Tunaberg, Sweden. The Indianite is from the gangue of the corundum in the Carnatic, and is associated with garnet, kyanite, and hornblende. A mineral from Bytown, U. C, analyzed by Tennant, has been referred to amphodelite. He obtained Si 45-80, Sl 26*15, Ca 16*25, Mg 2*95, Pe 4*70, Loss by ignition 2*00=97*85. Biotine is found among the volcanic debris of Vesuvius. Indianite occurs as the gangue of the corundum of the Carnatic.

B.B. fuses slowly on charcoal to a blue transparent glass ; with borax forms a clear bead. In powder attacked by concentrated acids, but not perfectly dissolved. Iolite is met with at Bodenmais, in Bavaria, occasionally in perfect crystallizations. This variety has been called peliom, from its smoky-blue color, from ncXios. It occurs in quartz, at Ujordlersoak, in Greenland ; in granite at Cape de Gata, in Spain ; at Arendal, in Norway ; at Orrijerfvi, in Finland, (Steinheilite) ; at Tunaberg, in Sweden, &c. Ceylon affords a transparent variety, in small roUed masses, of an intense blue color, the sapphire d'eau of jewellers. At Haddam, Conn., it is associated with garnet and anthophyllite in gneiss ; also in quartz with garnet and yellowish-green feldspar, near the Norwich and Worcester Rad way, between the Shetucket and Quinnebaug, where the gneiss has been quarried for the road; it is abundant in large massive individuals. At Brimfield, Mass., on the road leading to Warren, near Sam. Patrick's, it is associated with adularia, in gneiss ; occurs also in beautiful specimens at Richmond, N. H., in talcose rock, along with anthophyllite. It is occasionally employed as an ornamental stone, and when cut exhibits different colors in different directions. The name iolite is derived from ion, violet, and Xiflof, stone, in allusion to its color. From its property of exhibiting different colors in different directions, it has been named dichroite, from Sn, double, and X96a, color. This mineral gradually undergoes a change on exposure, becoming hydrated at first, and then farther changing its constitution through the removal of some ingredients by infiltrating waters ; and at the same time the structure becomes transversely foliated or micaceous. The minerals Pinite, Fahlunite, Bonsdorffite, Esmarkite, Chlorophylhte, Gigantolite, (see page 293), are iolite in the different states of alteration thus induced.

Garnet and Idocrase (in part) have the same formula, and the compound therefore is dimorphous, one of the forms being monometric and the other dimetric. Allanite appears also to have the same composi tion, with sometimes the addition of an atom or so of water. Epidote (R3Si+2fiSi) has the same crystallization as orthite. The crystals of the monoclinic species are usually long and slender, but sometimes broad tab ular. The colors are often bright, but very various, from white through bright green and red colors to black. The formula of garnet is essentially identical with that of hexagonal mica, and this last species adds therefore another form to the compound R3Si+fi\"Si. GARNET. Melanite. Pyrope. Grossularite.

Polyadelphite of Thomson is a brownish-yellow garnet from the Franklin Furnace, New Jersey. Garnet occurs imbedded in mica slate, granite, and gneiss, and occasionally in hme stone, chlorite slate, serpentine, and lava. The precious garnet occurs in Ceylon, Greenland, and Brazil. Common garnet is met with in dodecahedrons from three to four inches in diameter, at Fahlun in Sweden, Aren dal and Kongsberg in Norway, and the Zillerthal ; abundant in crystals of less size, in mica slate, in the island of Mull, in Perth and Inverness, Shetland ; of green color at Swartzenberg in Saxony. The magnesia-alumina garnet occurs at Arendal with calc spar. Melanite is found in the Vesuvian lavas, and also near Rome. Grossularite occurs near the Wilui River in Siberia. Cinnamon stone is met with in masses of considerable size in the primitive rocks of Ceylon, and at Malsjo in Wermland. . Romanzovite, a similar variety, comes from Kimito, Finland. Aplome occurs on the banks of the river Lena in Siberia, and at Swartzenberg in Saxony. Ouvarovite occurs in emerald-green dodecahe drons, at Bissersk in Russia, with chromic iron. In New Hampshire at Hanover, small clear crystals, in syenitic gneiss ; blood-red dodec ahedrons at Franconia, in geodes in massive garnet, with calc spar and magnetic iron; at Haverhill, some an inch and a half in diameter, in chlorite ; at Unity, on the estate of J. Neal, associated with actinolite and magnetic iron, and at Lisbon, near Mink Pond in mica slate with staurotide. In Massachusetts, at Carlisle, geodes of transparent cinnamon brown crystals, similar to figure 18, plate 1, with scapolite in hmestone ; at Boxborough. in similar but less remarkable specimens; also in gneiss at Brookfield and Brimfield; massive with epidote, at Newbury, and in crystals at Bedford, Chesterfield, with the Cummington kyanite, and at the beryl locality of Barre. In Maine, beautiful yellow crystals or cinnamon stone with idocrase, at Parsonsfield, Phippsburg, and Rumford ; man ganesian garnet occurs at Phippsburg, as well as the finest yellow garnet in Maine ; in mica slate near the bridge at Windham, with staurotide; in granite veins at Streaked"], [365, "349 ALUMINA. Mountain, along with beryl; in large reddish-brown crystals at Buckfield, on the estates of Mr. Waterman and Mr. Lowe ; the best red garnets in Maine, occur at Bruns wick. In Vermont, at New Fane, iu large crystals in chlorite slate ; also at Cabot and Cavendish. In Connecticut, polished trapezohedrons, from half an inch to an inch in diameter, in mica slate, at Monroe ; at Haddam, large brittle trapezohedrons of mangane sian garnet, often two inches through, with chrysoberyl ; at Lyme, blackish-brown crys tals of large size, (fig. 18, pi. 1), in limestone. In New York, in mica slate, in Dover, Duchess Co., small ; at Rogers's Rock, crystallized as well as massive, and colophonite of yellow, brown, and red colors, abundant ; brown crystals at Crown Point, Essex Co. ; a cinnamon variety, crystallized and massive, at Amity ; on the Croton aqueduct, near Yonkers, in small rounded crystals and a beautiful massive variety \u2014 the latter, when polished, forms a beautiful gem. In New Jersey, at Franklin, black, brown, yellow, red, and green dodecahedral garnets ; also near the Franklin furnace. In Pennsylvania, in Chester Co., at Pennsbury.fine dark-brown crystals, with polished faces, in granite ; near Knauertown, at Keims' mine, good aplome in handsome lustrous crystals ; at Chester, brown ; in Concord, color of pyrope ; in Leiperville, red ; at Mineral Hdl, fine brown. In Delaware, cinnamcn stone in trapezohedrons, at Dixon's quarry, seven miles from Wilmington. Also at Knife rapids on the Mississippi. Colophonite forms a large vein in gneiss at Willsborough, Essex Co., N. Y., associated with tabular spar and green coccoiite ; also at Lewis, ten mdes south of Keeseville, Essex Co. The cinnamon stone from Ceylon and the precious garnet are used as gems when large, finely colored, and transparent. The stone is cut quite thin, on account of the depth of color, with a pavilion cut below and a broad table above bordered with small facets. An octagonal garnet measuring 8^ lines by 6| has sold for near $700. Pulverized garnet is sometimes employed as a substitute for emery. The garnet was, in part, the carbunculus of the ancients, a term probably applied also to the spinel and Oriental ruby. The Alabandic carbuncles of Pliny were so called because cut and polished at Alabanda. Hence the name Almandine, now in use. Pliny describes vessels of the capacity of a pint, formed from carbuncles, \" non claros ac ple rumque sordidos ac semper fulgoris horridi,\" devoid of lustre and beauty of color, which probably were large common garnets. The garnet is supposed also to have been the hyacinth of the ancients. Garnet, brown tourmaline, idocrase, and staurotide have often much resemblance in color and lustre, and sometimes even in form. When in regular crystals garnet is readily distinguished by its monometric shapes. But frequently the dodecahedrons are length ened, as in figure 11, page 78, so as to resemble six-sided prisms with rhombohedral ter minations, like tourmaline ; or distorted in another direction, as in figure 12, so as to look hke a square prism of idocrase or zircon. In each case the determination of the angles will show that the basal edges are equal to the lateral ; and without a goniometer the iden tity of the terminal and lateral planes will be seen in their similarity in lustre and stri\u00e6 or markings. In another mode of distortion, represented in figure 14, page 78, the gar net looks hke an octahedron of spinel, and the distortion in figure 13 may approach some staurotides. Spinel, zircon, staurotide, and corundum are infusible before the blowpipe, as well as insoluble in acids. Idocrase is more fusible than garnet and has less specific gravity. The color of the red garnet when transparent, is much more sombre than that of red spinel or sapphire, and when set in jewelry it is readdy distinguished by its peculiar tint . .... Rutile may also have the color and lustre of garnet, and its semitransparency ; but its higher specific gravity at once distinguishes it, as well as its infusibility. PYROPE. Bohemian Garnet.

Hermann makes the iron mostly peroxyd, and changes the formula accordingly. He deduces for the oxygen ratio in R, B, Si, 9 : 6 : 14. But his last analysis_(No. 20) gives more nearly the ratio 9 : 6 : 15, and this yields the formula 3R3Si-)-2fiSL Another of his analyses affords the proportion 8-77 : 6 : 14-48, which he interprets 9_: 6 : 14 ; yet it is nearer 9:6:15. The proportion 9 : 6 : 14 corresponds to 27R, 6R, 14Si, which cannot be arranged into a probable formula. B.B. fuses easily with some intumescence to a translucent yellow globule, and forms with borax a diaphanous glass, tinged with iron. By fusion the specific gravity is re duced to 293 \u2014 2-945, according to Magnus, without any change of composition. Cyp rine in the reduction flame affords a red pearl from the copper present. Idocrase is at tacked by the acids, and after heating wholly dissolves and gelatinizes. Idocrase was first observed in the ancient Vesuvian lavas, and was thence called Ve suviaa It has since been met with in serpentine, gneiss, and granular Umestone. The Vesuvian idocrase has a hair-brown or olive-green color, and is associated^ with ice-spar, garnet, mica, and nephehne. The finest specimens occur at Ala, in the Val-di- Brozzo, in Piedmont ; they are usually transparent, of brilliant lustre, and have green or brown colors ; rarely perfectly black. Egg, near Christiana, in Norway, the Ural, Wilui river, near Lake Baikal, Cziklowa in the Bannat, and Monzoni in the Fassa valley, are other localities. Crystals of a sulphur yellow-color have been found at the latter place. From Frugard, Finnland, comes the frugardite ; and from Gokum what has been called gokumite, and loboite. Liver-brown diverging groups, from Eger in Bohemia, have been called egeran. Crystals of a blue tint, called cyprine, come from near Tellemark, Norway ; the color is attributed to copper. Phippsburg and Rumford, just below the falls in Maine, afford fine crystals and massive idocrase associated with yellow garnet, pyroxene, Ac, in hmestone ; also Parsonsfield, Me, with the same minerals, abundant; also at Poland, and Sandford, Me. It has been col lected at Worcester, Mass, in a quartz rock, with garnet, but the locality is exhausted. A yellowish-brown idocrase occurs in crystals at Newtown, N. J, associated with corundum and spineL Half a mile south of Amity, N. Y, grayish and yellowish-brown crystals, eometimes an inch in diameter, occur in granular limestone ; also at the village and a mile east of the village, of yellow, greenish-yellow, and yellowish-brown colors. The Xanthite, which is from this vicinity, is identical in crystallization with common ido crase. Minute crystals joccur in Umestone with sphene on the banks of Vrooman s lake, in Antwerp, near Oxbow. , The name idocrase is derived from -i-o, to see, and upturn, mixture, because the crys talline forms have much resemblance to those of some other specie.."], [368, "352 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY.

The mangane- sian variety fuses readUy with intumescence ; glass with borax amethystine in the ex- terior flame. In acids the varieties are but partiaUy decomposed, except after a strong heating. The specific gravity changes with heating. An Arendal specimen examined by Rammelsberg (No. 14 above) had G.=3*403 before heating, 3*271 after heating. Most specimens of epidote afford a minute globule of tin before the blowpipe. Arendal, in Norway, affords fine crystals, whence the name Arendalite. Occurs also in the Ural, Piedmont, Fichtelgebirge, Rothlaue in the Canton of Berne, FaUtigel in Tyrol, Grossarl in Salzburg, Bourg d'Oisans, and numerous other places. Bucklandite is from Achmatowsk, Arendal, and Lake Laach. Puschkinite is from west of the Urals, north of Katherinenburg. Zoisite accompanies kyanite, hornblende, and titanium, in the Sau Alpe and the Bacher mountain in Styria, in the Tyrol, <fec. The manganesian variety occurs at St. Marcel, in the valley of Aosta, in Piedmont. At Franconia, N. H, both crystaUized and granular epidote are abundant, the latter containing magnetic iron. Large crystals of unusual beauty are obtained at Haddam, Conn.

Reaction of iron with the fluxes, and with soda a manganese reaction. Uralorthite intumesces, often very easily, and fuses on the edges to a black blebby glass. Some allanites, and also some orthites, gelatinize with acids ; others are imperfectly decomposed. Uralorthite is dissolved in acids, somewhat gelatinizing. These varieties occur in albitic and common feldspathic granite, zircon-syenite, por phyry and white limestone. Allanite occurs in Greenland, in granite.

The Allanite from Jotun Fjeld gelatinizes with acids, while that from Snarum is not affected by acids. Cerine occurs at Bastnas in Sweden with hornblende and copper pyrites. Orthite occurs in acicular crystals sometimes a foot in length at Finbo near Fahlun, and at Ytterby in Sweden ; at Skeppsholm near Stockholm, in black vitreous masses disseminated through gneiss ; also at Hitteroe and Fille Fjeld in Norway, at Mi ask in the Ural The name is derived from opBos, straight Uralorthite occurs with small crystals of zircon in flesh-red feldspar at Miask in the Ural. In the United States, Allanite has been found in large crystals in Allen's vein at the gneiss quarries, Haddam, Conn. ; in small crystals at the Bolton quarry, Mass.; at South Royalstou in boulders ; at Athol on the road to Westminster in gneiss. A massive pitch-black mineral from Monroe, Orange Co, N. Y, (Anal. 8), has been referred to this species ; a simdar variety is found at East Bradford, Chester Co, Pa. ; G.=3-5. MICA FAMILY. Under the term Mica, various aluminous compounds are included, which are alike in having an eminently easy cleavage in one direction. The species are distinguished often with great difficulty by external char acters, and at times not at all, even when crystallized, except by means of chemical analysis or polarized light.* The oblique micas contain, in general, potash or lithia, and little mag nesia. The trimetric and hexagonal micas contain magnesia and often little alkali. MUSCOVITE, D. Oblique Mica. Biaxial Mica. Potash Mica. Glimmer, in part. Muscovy Glass. Verre de Moscovie.

In analyses 1 to 7, the oxygen of the peroxyds and silica has closely the ratio 3:4; or for the protoxyds, peroxyds and_silica lj 12 : 16, affording 3R, 12A), 16SL H. Rose suggested the formula fiSi-|-4AlSi, corresponding to the ratio 1 : 12 : 15, or a ratio of 4 to 5 between the oxygen of the alumina and sihca. But the analyses alluded to, afford quite uniformly the ratio 3 : 4, instead of 4 : 6. The Abborforss mica (No. 8) also has closely the same ratio 3:4; or for the whole 2:9:12, giving the formula R2Si+3SSi. Analysis No. 9 has nearly the ratio 3 : 4 for the peroxyds and silica, and the whole ratio 1 : 9 : 12 (or more nearly IJ : 9 : 12.) The formula, as Rammelsberg states, may be RSi-j-3Al'Si. Analysis No. 10 has the oxygen ratio 161 : 1832 : 24-29 (and for the water 435). This gives 3 : 4 for the peroxyds and sdica, and very nearly 1 : 12 : 16 : 3 for the whole ratio. The mica is a granular variety. In recapitulation, the analyses afford, excluding the water, the following ratios for the oxygen of the protoxyds, peroxyds, and sihca : Nos. 1 to 7, i : 3 : 4. No. 9, } : 3 : 4. No. 8, | : 3 : 4. No. 10, i : 3 : 4. B.B. fuses with some difficulty to a grayish-yellow blebby glass. Dissolves easily with borax and salt of phosphorus, leaving with the last a silica skeleton. The variety composed of scales arranged in plumose forms is called plumose mica; and that with a diagonal cleavage, prismatic mica. In the Pennsbury (Penn.) mica, the cleavage direction is not the line of either diago nal, but makes an angle of 30\u00b0 with the shorter, so that the plates formed by it are often nearly rectangular, two of the edges being cleavage edges and two primary edges of the crystal. Mica is one of the constituents of granite, and its associate rocks, gneiss, syenite, and mica slate. It also occurs in more recent aggregate rocks ; also in imbedded crystals in granular limestone, wacke, trachyte, and basalt. Coarse lamellar aggregations often form the matrix of crystals of topaz, tourmaline, and other mineral species. Siberia affords lamin\u00e6 of mica, sometimes exceeding a yard in diameter, and other remarkable foreign localities are at Finbo in Sweden, and Skutterud in Norway. Fine crystallizations of mica occur in granite at Acworth, Grafton, and Alstead, N. H, and the plates are at times a yard across and perfectly transparent ; also at Pans and Streaked Mountain, Maine. In Massachusetts, at Chesterfield with tourmaline and albite, Barre and South Royalston with beryl, and at Mendon and Brimfield ; at Chester,"], [374, "358 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY.

In Connecticut, at Monroe of a dusky brown color, having internal hexagonal bands of a darker shade ; in brown hex agonal crystal at the Middletown feldspar quarry ; at Haddam pale brownish, with columbite, and also similar at another locality with garnets. Six miles southeast of Warwick, N. Y, crystals and plates sometimes a foot in diameter, in a vein of feldspar ; a mde northwest of Edenville in six-sided and rhombic prisms ; a silvery mica near Eden vdle; in St. Lawrence Co, eight mdes from Potsdam, on the road to Pierrepont, mica is found iu plates seven inches across ; town of Edwards in large prisms, six-sided or rhom bic ; Greenfield, near Saratoga, in reddish-brown crystals with chrysoberyl ; on the Croton acqueduct near Yonkers, in rhombs with a cleavage in the direction of the shorter diagonal. In Pennsylvania, in fine hexagonal crystals of a dark brown color at Pennsbury near Pennsvdle, Chester Co. ; at the Unionville Corundum locality, of a whi tish color; and also at another locality one and a half miles distant ; in Phdadelphia Co. on the railroad near Philadelphia, smoky brown with hexagonal internal bands ; at Chesnut Hill near the Wissahiccon, a green variety ; at Leiperville, Delaware Co, faint greenish ; in New Jersey, crystals are obtained at Newtown and Franklin. In Dela ware, Newcastle Co, at Dixon's quarry, associated with apatite ; on the Wilmington road near the woodlands. In Maryland, at Jones's Falls, a mile and three quarters from Baltimore ; the plates show by transmitted light a series of concentric hexagons, the sides of which are parallel with the sides of a hexagonal prism. The biaxial character of many of these micas has been particularly examined by the author, in connection with B. Silliman, Jr. (See Appendix). Thomson has analyzed (Min. i, 360) a mica reported from Orange Co., N. Y, and stated to be in \" fine rhomboidal prisms,\" and obtained Si 49-38, Al 2367, Pe 731, fi 1529, Ca 613, ti 006=101-89, affording the oxygen ratio 1:3:6, and the formula RSi+fiSi, corresponding to some Lithia micas. An oblique mica from Vesuvius of a blackish-green color, and another from Zillerthal, have been found to have the composition of magnesia mica or biotite, giving the for mula R3Si+HSi ; P : M=98\u00b0 40' ; M : M=120\u00b0 46'.

As there are more than one \" potash mica,\" \" oblique mica,\" or \" common mica,\" a dis tinctive name for the above species has become necessary.

The mica of No. 2 has not been shown to be biaxial ; yet, as it agrees in atomic proportions with the Phlogopite, it appears to belong here.

B.B. like common mica, fusing to a white enamel, and giving the reaction usually of fluorine. Svanberg's mica was from Sala, Sweden. A mica with the color given for phlogo pite occurs at Natural Bridge, Jefferson Co, N. Y. It is yellowish brown, somewhat copper-like, and nearly yellow in thin lamin\u00e6. The angle between the axes of polari zation is about 16\u00b0, according to measurements by the author in connection with B. Sdliman, Jr. Henderson has been cited by mistake as the locality of a mica of this kind. There ar\u00bb other similar micas having a still smaller angle between the axes, which in thin lamin\u00e6 show a single series of ellipses, slightly differing from circles ; but in thicker pieces exhibit the two sets partly complete. A variety from Edwards, N. Y, is transparent to opaque white and somewhat pearly, with a soapy feel to the powder ; and the angle between the axes is 13\u00b0 to 14\u00b0. Very similar in optical characters are the following :\u2014 a brown copper mica from Pope's MUls, St. Lawrence Co, N. Y, and a transparent glassy mica from the same locality, both occurring in long and large hexagonal prisms, often tapering at the extremities, as if modified by accumina ting planes, and having (the latter) for the optical angle 7\u00b0 ; a light coppery mica from Franklin, N. J, occurring in large plates. A brown mica on Vrooman's lake, N. Y, near Rossie, belongs to this species ; but the particular variety is not yet ascertained. Dufrenoy describes hexagonal micas from Clayette, (Dept. of Saone-et-Loire), and from the Dept. of Finisterre, and also Lake Baikal, which are trimetric, resembling closely the Pope's Mills crystals, with the angle M : M 120\u00b0 nearly, and P on the plane on the basal edges 95\u00b0.

Recently Hermann has examined some Russian tourmalines and obtained a large per centage of boracic acid, amounting to 1178 per cent, in one specimen, besides 1 to 2^ per cent, of carbonic acid, (J. f. pr. Chem. xxxv, 232) ; but his results are not deemed perfectly satisfactory. See Appendix. B.B. the action is various. In general, they intumesce more or less, some fusing readi ly, particularly those which contain lime, others assumhig a slaggy appearance, without melting, while others, especially the red variety, are not acted on at all. Blue tourmalines have been termed indicolite, from their indigo-blue color ; the color less, achroite ; red tourmalines, rubellite ; and to the black, the name schorl was form erly applied. The green color is due to iron, and the red to oxyd of manganese. Tourmaline is usually found in granite, gneiss or mica slate. It also occurs in dolomite or granular limestone, and in sandstone near dykes of igneous rocks. Large black tourmalines occur in Greenland, at Horlberg, near Bodenmais in Bavaria \u25a0 at Karingbricka in Sweden ; near Bovey in Devonshire. Small brdliant crystals in de composed feldspar, at Andreasberg in the Hartz, are the variety Aphrizite. Rubellite occurs near Ekatherinenburg in Siberia ; pale yellowish brown crystals are found in talc at Windisch Kappell, in Carinthia ; white specimens (Achroite) come from St. Gothard,' Siberia and Elba. Rubellites of gigantic size occur in the Altai Mts., Siberia. In the United States, magnificent red and green tourmalines have been found at Paris Maine ; some of the transparent crystals exceed an inch in diameter, and have a ruby red color within, surrounded by green; or are red at one extremity and green at the other. Blue and pink varieties commonly imbedded in lepidolite, are still to be obtained at this place. Red and green tourmalines occur at Chesterfield, Mass., in a narrow vein of granite traversing gneiss along with albite, uranite, and pyrochlore. The crystals are commonly small and curved, nearly opaque, and exceedingly frangible. Green crystals often contain distinct prisms of red color, especially when they occur in smoky quartz Blue tourmalines also occur at this locahty. At Goshen, Mass., similar varieties occur and the blue tourmaline is met with in greater perfection. Norwich, New Braintree and Carlisle, Mass., afford good black tourmalines ; also Alstead, Grafton, Acworth and' Sad dleback Mt., N. H., and Streaked Mountain, Me ; Brattleboro', Vt. \u2022 large brownish black tourmalines are abundant in steatite at Orford, N. H Green and black tourma lines are found with beryl and feldspar at Albany. Me. Perfect crystals of a dark brown color occur in mica-slate near Lane's Mine, Monroe, Conn They are sometimes two inches in length and breadth. Haddam, Conn., affords interesting black crystals in"], [381, "ALUMINA. 365 mica slate with anthophyllite, in granite with iolite, and at the gneiss quarries. Near Gouverneur, N. Y., light and dark brown tourmalines, often in highly modified crystals, occur with apatite and scapolite in granular limestone ; also at Canton ; also in simple prisms in the same rock near Port Henry, Essex Co. ; also at Schroon, with chondrodite and scapolite. Black crystals are obtained at the chrysoberyl locality near Saratoga, N. Y. ; also at Alexandria, Jefferson Co. At Kingsbridge, N. Y., brown, yellowish or red dish-brown crystals occur in dolomite. Gray or bluish-gray and green varieties in three-sided prisms occur near Edenville. Short black crystals are found in the same vi cinity, and at Rocky Hill, sometimes five inches in diameter. A mde southwest of Amity, yellow and cinnamon colored crystals occur with spinel in calc spar ; also near the same village a clove- brown variety associated with hornblende and rutde in granu lar limestone. Franklin and Newton, N. J., also afford interesting black and brown tourmalines in limestone, associated with spinel Good crystals occur in Pennsylvania at Newlin, Chester Co. ; at London Grove and near Unionvdle, of a light yellow color in limestone, and rarely white; at Parksburg ; Aston ; at Chester, fine black ; Leiperville, Delaware Co., black; Marple, Lancaster Co., of a green color in talc; opposite New Hope, Buck's Co. ; in New Garden township, Chester Co., in limestone, of light brown to vedow and sometimes transparent crystals.

Axinite occurs in implanted glassy clove-brown crystals, at St. Cristophe near Bourg d'Oisans in Dauphiny, along with albite, prehnite, and quartz ; at the silver mines of Kongsberg, in smaller crystals ; with hornblende or magnetic iron ore in Normark in Sweden, and in rather complex crystals, of a dark color, at the Botallack mine in Corn wall, where it also occurs massive, forming a peculiar kind of rock with garnet and tour maline ; also at Thum near Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony, and called Thumite and Thum merstein. Axinite has been found by Jackson at Phipsburg, Maine, associated with yellow garnet and idocrase ; also at Wales, Maine, Axinite admits of a high pohsh, but is deficient in delicacy of color. It was named from ofo-Fj, an axe, in allusion to the form of the crystals. TOPAZ. Fluosilicate of Alumina, Thorn. Physalite, Pyrophysalite, Hisinger. Schorlite. Schorlartiger BerU, W. Stangenstein.

Rammelsberg suggests that the fluorine replaces oxygen, and writes for topaz the simple formula, Al3 Si2, one-seventh of the oxygen being replaced by fluorine. This formula written out in full, and substituting 0 (oxygen), for the dots, that it may correspond with F (fluorine), becomes 6 [3 Al2 03+2 Si 03]+[3 Al2 F3+2 Si F3]. This view of the constitution is sustained by the near isomorphism of topaz with anda lusite, (Am. J. Sci. [8], ix, 407), which last has the formula Al* Si2.

Pyroelectric, (p. 137)."], [383, "ALUMINA. 367 Physalite or pyrophysalite of Hisinger is a coarse nearly opaque variety, found in vellowish-white crystals of considerable dimensions ; it intumesces when heated, and hence its name from ipvciau, to blow. Minute crystals of 3 or 4 kinds, and 2 or 3 kinds of fluids have been detected by Sir David Brewster in crystals of topaz. Topaz occurs in granite, with tourmaline, mica, and beryl, occasionally apatite, fluor spar, and tin ; also in talcose rock, as in Brazil, with euclase, &c. With quartz, tourmaline, and lithomarge, it forms the topaz rock of Werner. Specimens of quartz crystal from Brazil, penetrated by topaz, are not uncommon. Fine topazes are brought from the Uralian and Altai mountains, Siberia, and from Kamschatka, where they occur of green and blue colors. In Brazil they are found of a deep yellow color, either in veins or nests in lithomarge, or in loose crystals or pebbles. Magnificent sky-blue crystals have been obtained in Cairngorum, Aberdeenshire ; Jame son mentions a crystal from this locality, which weighed nineteen ounces. The tin mines of Schlackenwald, Zinnwald, and Ehrenfriedersdorf in Bohemia, afford smaller crystals. In the Mourne mountains small limpid crystals occur with beryl, albite, and mica, in drusy cavities in granite. Physalite occurs m crystals of great size, at Finbo, Sweden, in a granite quarry, and at Broddbo in a boulder. One crystal from this locality, at Stockholm, weighs eighty pounds. Topaz occurs in the Uuited States at Trumbull and Middletown, Conn., and Crowder's Mountain, N. C. At Trumbull the crystals are abundant, but are seldom transparent, except those of small size ; these are usually white, or with a tinge of green or yellow. The large coarse crystals are sometimes six or seven inches in diameter, but are deficient in lustre, and nearly opaque. They are associated with magnetic pyrites, mica, and chlorophane ; also rarely with wolfram and tungstate of lime. Topaz is employed in jewelry, either of its natural yellow color or altered by heat. The variety from Brazil, when heated, assumes a pink or red hue, resembling the Balas ruby. The finest crystals are brought from Minas Novas in Brazil. From their peculiar limpidity, topaz pebbles are sometimes denominated gouttes cVeau. The coarse varieties of topaz may be employed as a substitute for emery. PYCNITE.

The oriental ruby belongs to the species sapphire."], [388, "372 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Spinel occurs imbedded in granular limestone, and with calcareous spar in eerpentine and gneiss. It also occupies the cavities of volcanic rocks. In Ceylon, Siam, and other eastern countries, it occurs, of beautiful colors, in rolled pebbles in the channels of rivers. The pleonaste variety is found at Candy, in Ceylon, and hence was called Candite, by Bournon. At Aker, in Sudermannland, Sweden, it is found of a pale-blue and pearl-gray color, in primitive hmestone. Small black crystals of splendent lustre occur at Vesuvius, in the ancient scoria of Mount Somma, associated with mica and idocrase ; also imbedded in compact gehlenite, at Monzoni, in the Fassathal. From Amity, N. Y., to Andover, N. J., a distance of about tliirty mdes, is a region of granular limestone and serpentine, in which localities of spinel abound. At Amity, crys tals are occasionally found sixteen inches in diameter ; and one, collected by Dr. Heron, weighs forty-nine pounds ; it is in three pieces and contains cavities studded with crystals of corundum. They occur of various shades of green, black, brown, and less commonly red, along with chondrodite, and other minerals. A mile southwest of Amity, on J. Lay ton's farm, is one of the most remarkable localities ; also on W. Raynor's farm, a mile to the north : another half a mile north, affording grayish-red octahedrons ; and others to the south. Localities are numerous about Warwick, and also at Monroe and Cornwall, though less favorable for exploration than those at Amity. Franklin, N. J., affords crystals of vari ous shades of black, blue, green, and red, which are sometimes transparent, and a bluish green ceylanite variety here, has the lustre of polished steel ; Newton, N. J., pearl-gray crystals along with blue corundum, tourmaline, and rutile ; Bryan, red, brown, green, and black colors, along with chondrodite. At Sterling, Sparta, and Vernon, N. J., are other localities. Light blue spinels occur sparingly in limestone in Antwerp, Jefferson Co., N. Y., two and a half miles south of Oxbow, and pink and reddish-brown in Gouverneur, two miles north of Somerville, St. Lawrence Co. Green, blue, and occasionally red va rieties occur in granular limestone at Bolton, Boxborough, Chelmsford, and Littleton, Mass. Soft octahedral crystals occur in Warwick, which, according to Beck, are spinels permeated with steatite or serpentine, (Min. N. Y, p. 318). They have been considered pseudomorphs. Good spinel occurs in Burgess, Canada. The automolite occurs in talcose slate near Fahlun and elsewhere in Sweden. The dysluite is from Sterling, N. J., along with franklinite and troostite. Kreittonite is from Bodenmais ; and chlorospinel from Slatoust. The fine colored spinels, when of large size, are highly esteemed as gems. Note. The minerals franklinite, magnetic iron, and chromic iron belong to the spinel series, each being composed of equal parts of protoxyds and peroxyds. Frankhnite=(2:n, Ee), (Stn, Pe).

Emerald and beryl are varieties of the same species, the former including the rich green transparent specimens, which owe their color to oxyd of chrome, the latter those of other colors. They were first united in one species by Wallerius. The finest emeralds are found in a vein of dolomite, which traverses a hornblende rock at Muso, near Santa F6 de Bogota, in Grenada. A perfect hexagonal crystal from this locality, two inches long and about an inch in diameter, is in the cabinet of the Duke of Devonshire. It"], [390, "374 UESCRIPT1VE MINERALOGY. weighs 8 oz. 18 dwts., and though containing numerous flaws, and therefore but partially fit for jewelry, has been valued at 150 guineas. A more splendid specimen, though somewhat smaller, weighing but 6 oz., is in the possession of Mr. Hope, of London. It cost \u00a3500. Emeralds of less beauty, but much larger, occur in Siberia. One speci men in the Royal collection measures 14+ inches long and 12 broad, and weighs 16f pounds troy ; another is 7 inches long and 4 broad, and weighs 6 pounds troy. Mount Zalora, in Upper Egypt, affords a less distinct variety, and was the only locality which was known to the ancients. Other localities are Canjargum in Hindostan, and Salzburg, where it is imbedded in mica slate. Phny speaks of the finest beryls as those \" qui viriditatem puri maris imitantur,\" \u2014 green like the sea, \u2014 and crystals of clear shades of sky-blue, or mountain-green, are hence termed aquamarine. This variety is found in Siberia, Hindostan, and Brazil. In Sibe ria they occur in the granite district of Nertschinsk, and in the Uralian and Altai ranges of Siberia. They have been obtained exceeding a foot in length ; they are commonly very deeply striated longitudinally. The most splendid specimen of this variety, of which we have any account, belongs to Don Pedro. It approaches in size, and also form, the head of a calf, and exhibits a crystalline structure only on one side ; the rest is water worn. It weighs 225 ounces troy, or more than 18^ pounds. The specimen is perfectly transparent, and without a flaw ; its color is a fine pale bottle-green. Less clear crys tals of beryl occur at the Mourne mountains, Ireland, county Down ; rarely at Cairngo rum in Aberdeenshire ; at Limoges in France ; Finbo and Broddbo in Sweden ; Boden mais and Rabenstein in Bavaria, tin mines of Schlackenwald, and elsewhere. Beryls of gigantic dimensions have been found in the United States, at Acworth, N. H., and Royalston, Mass. One hexagonal prism from the former locality weighed 240 pounds, and measured four feet in length, with the lateral faces 5 j inches across; its color was bluish-green, except a foot at one extremity, which was dull green and yellow. Other crystals have a honey or wax-yellow color. At Royalston, one crystal has been obtained exceeding a foot in length. The smaller prisms are often limpid, and a variety of a yellowish color forms a gem resembling chrysolite ; the colors are mostly aquama rine, grass-green, and yellowish-green. The locality is in the southeast part of Royals ton, near the school-house, on the land of Mr. Clarke ; the best crj-stals are imbedded in quartz. At Barre, Mass., there is a similar locahty, though less remarkable ; also at Pearl Hill, in Fitchburg, Goshen, and Chesterfield, Mass. At Compton, N. H., the beryls are as fine as at Royalston. Albany, in Maine, and Norwich , a fe w miles above Bethel, towards Waterford, afford fine large beryls with green and black tourmalines ; crystals, often large, are also obtained at Streaked Mountain, with black tourmaline and mica ; at Bowdoinhara and Topham of a pale green or yellowish-white color in veins of graphic granite ; at Georgetown, Parker's Island, at the mouth of the Kennebec ; at Wilmot, N. H.; in interesting crystals, with modified terminations, (fig. 1), at Haddam, Conn., in a feldspar vein in gneiss, on the east side of the river ; the crystals are limpid at the extremity for about a twelfth of an inch, as indicated by the dotted line in fig. 1 ; the chrysoberyl locality affords less interesting specimens ; also the Middletown feldspar quarry, and the granite of Chatham, near the cobalt mine. At Monroe, Conn., beryl oc curs in a granite vein, and the crystals often consist naturally of several pieces separated by plates of quartz, (fig. 30, p. 81). Crystals, sometimes ten or twelve inches in length, and an inch and a half in diameter, occur with black tourmalines at Leipervdle and Ches ter, Pennsylvania, Delaware Co. ; also less interesting at Mineral Hill. The emerald is supposed to derive its color from the presence of a minute quantity of oxyd of chrome, and beryl from oxyd of iron. This species affords some of the most splendid ornaments to the cabinet of the mineralogist. The emerald is among the rich est of gems.

It occurs in chlo rite slate resting on sandstone. Scacchi suggests a relation between this species and epi dote. Euclase generally possesses an agreeable and uniform color, and will receive a high pohsh ; but it is useless as an ornamental stone, on account of its brittleness.

Chrysoberyl occurs in Brazil, and also Ceylon, in rolled pebbles, in the alluvial depos its of rivers ; also in the Ural in mica slate, with beryl and phenacite ; this variety, which is of an emerald-green color, and coluinbine-red by transmitted light, has been called Alexandrite. It is supposed to be colored by chrome and to bear the same relation to common chrysoberyl that the emerald does to beryl. At Haddam, Ct., it occurs in gran ite traversing gneiss, and is associated with tourmaline, garnet, beryl, automolite, and col umbite. It is found also in the same rock at Greenfield, near Saratoga, N.

Hyacinth includes those individuals which present bright colors, considerable transpa rency, and smooth and shining surfaces. Zirconite presents grayish or brownish tints, and is frequently rough or opaque. The variety from Ceylon, which is colorless, or has a smoky-tinge, and is therefore sold for inferior diamonds, is sometimes called jargon. Hyacinth occurs in the sand and alluvial deposits of certain rivers in Ceylon, at Ex pailly near Le Puy, France, at Ohlapian in Transylvania, occasionally in volcanic tufa in Auvergne, and at Vesuvius. Splendid specimens occur in Greenland, and in the zircon syenite of Fredericksvarn in Norway ; in the Rmen mountains, Ural ; in the hon mines of Arendal, and at many places in Europe ; occurs also in Scotland, at Scalpay in Harris, and in the granite of Criffel in Kirkcudbrightshire.

Tin has been reported as occurring native. The common ore consists of tin combined with oxygen, (Sn). Tin is also occasionally found as a sulphuret ; also in some ores of columbium ; and in traces in a few ores of titanium and uranium. Titanium is also said to occur native. It is found in the state of an acid, Ii, (in rutile, brookite, and anatase) ; also the same acid in combi nation with lime, alumina, yttria, ceria, zirconia, oxyds of iron, and other bases, and is sometimes associated with silica in composition. As an oxyd (\u00a5i) it is isomorphous with peroxyd of iron, (Pe), and the two oc cur together in various proportions, under a common form, in titanic iron. Columbium, (or Tantalum), Tungsten, and Molybdenum, are other metals of the same group ; but these exist in nature only in combination. With oxygen, we have tungstic and molybdic ochre ; with bases, columbates of lime, yttria, oxyds of cerium, and iron ; tungstates of lime, iron, lead ; molybdate of lead ; with sulphur, sulphuret of molybdenum. An instance of the isomorphism of tungsten and columbium is afforded (as first shown by H. Rose) in columbium and wolfram. The metals Niobium and Pelopium are usually associated with Columbium, and are related to it in character. The metal Columbium (Tantalum) in the pure state is brittle, of a black color, and infusible. Tungsten, or Wolframium, is a gray metal resem bling iron. Its specific gravity is high, it being 17-5 ; and it is almost in fusible. It is reduced from its ores with great difficulty. Molybdenum is a white brittle metal, and is nearly infusible. G. = 8-615. It tarnishes on exposure. NATIVE TIN. In small grayish-white metallic grains along with the Siberian gold. Composition. \u2014 Tin with some lead. Hermann, J. f. pr. Ch. xxxiii, 300.

Fused with caustic potash it yields a mass which is mostly soluble in water ; hydriodic acid throws down from the solution a yeUow precipitate. Tin ore is met with in veins traversing granite, gneiss, mica or clay slate, and porphyry. CornwaU affords the finest and most remarkable simple crystals, associated with fluor, apatite, topaz, blende, wolfram, Ac. The singular compound crystals come mostly from Bohemia and Saxony. The twin forms from Zinnwald and Schlackenwald often weigh several pounds. It also occurs in Galicia, Greenland, Sweden, and the peninsula of Malacca and the island of Banca in the East Indies. The fibrous or wood tin occurs in botryoidal and renifonn shapes of a radiated struc ture, and composed of concentric coats, and is found in Cornwall and BrazU. Toad's ei/e tin is the same, on a smaU scale. Stream tin iithe aUuvial debris of tin veins which is separated from the gravel by washing. It occurs in the low grounds of Cornwall. The United States have afforded a few smaU crystals of tin at Chesterfield and Goshen, Mass., associated with albite and tourmaline ; also at Lyme, N. H., and more abundantly on the estate of Mr. Eastman, in the town of Jackson, N. H., where it was discovered by Dr. C. T. Jackson. It has also been observed sparingly in some of the gold mines of Virginia, by Prof. Rogers, imbedded in a talco-micaceous slate. 49"], [402, "386 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY.

With borax they afford a clear yeUowish-green glass. Imperfectly soluble in heated muriatic acid ; and if the solution be concentrated along with tin, it becomes of a fine violet color. This species was formerly divided into titanite and sphene ; the former included the brown or black variety, the latter the lighter colored and translucent. Sphene occurs in imbedded crystals, in gneiss, granite, mica slate, and granular Ume- stone ; also in syenite, and beds of iron ore. Titanite occurs with pyroxene, in beds of iron ore, at Arendal in Norway, in granite in Greenland. Sphene in complicated compound crystals of a pale green color and trans- parent, occurs at Graubindeu in the Grisons, associated with feldspar and chlorite ; in mica slate at St. Gothard ; also at Mont Blanc, and elsewhere, in the Alps. Small crystals occur in syenite at Strontian in Argyleshire, and Criffel in Galloway. Occasion- ally it is found among volcanic rocks, as at Lake Laach, and Andernach on the Rhine. Greenovite is from St. Marcel in Piedmont ; its crystallization was shown to be iden- tical with that of sphene by Descloizeaux. Occurs in Canada, at GienviUe and Elmsley. In Maine in fine crystals at Sanford, also at Thurston. In Massachusetts, good crystals in gneiss, in the east part of Lee; at Bol- ton with pyroxene and scapolite in limestone ; at Pelham. In Connecticut, at Trumbull. In New Jersey, at Franklin, of a honey-yellow color. In Pennsylvania, Buck's Co., three miles west of Attleboro', associated with tabular spar and graphite. In New York, at Rogers' Rock on Lake George, abundant in small brown crystals, along with graphite and pyroxene ; at Gouverneur, in black crystals in granular Umestone with scapolite ; in Diana, near Natural Bridge, Lewis Co., in dark brown crystals, among which is the vari ety lederite ; the crystals of sphene are sometimes nearly three inches square and one of them is here represented from a figure by William S.

Pulverized it dissolves easily in borax or salt of phosphorus ; adding largely of the fluxes, it forms a clear glass, winch, with still more of the flux, becomes yellowish-green; with less, the glass remains colorless. Pyrrbite was found by von Perovski of St. Petersburg, at Alabaschka, near Mursinsk, where it occurs in drusy feldspar cavities, containing also tables of lithia mica, crystals of albite. and a single crystal of white topaz. The largest crystal was but three lines long. The name is from mppos, yellow. With this species J. E. Teschemacher identifies small orange-yellow octahedrons found with albite at the Azores. The crystals are a half to two lines long, and those of minute size are transparent. According to chemical and blowpipe trials by A. A. Hayes, on specimens furnished him by Mr. Teschemacher, these crystals consist of columbate (niobate) of zirconia, colored apparently by oxyds of iron, uranium, and manganese. B.B. in the forceps on the first impulse of heat, becomes darker, and the fine orange color returns on cooling, even if the heat has been high ; at the melting point of cast hon, in the reduction flame, the color becomes permanently darker and brown. With borax (6 parts to 1 of assay) it dissolves and affords a clear colorless glass, which be comes instantly opaline or opaque on flaming ; transferred to the oxydating flame be comes opaque. With salt of phosphorus (in the same proportion) in the inner flame gives a clear glass, and when reduced, the glass is green ; but in the outer becomes yel low. With a little more of assay, the glass remains clear. With soda (12 parts to 1 of assay) dissolves ; some clear portions are seen in the globule while hot, but on coohng, opacity precedes the crystallization of the globule ; finally a gray -brown slag remains, which, cooled from the outer flame, has a green color indicating oxyd of manganese. Decomposed by much soda, and the resulting mass heated with nitric acid, gives a heavy white insoluble powder, which with boiling water takes a flocculent form ; the powder exhibited all the characters of columbic (niobic) acid. The acid solution, when mixed with carbonate of ammonia, remains clear ; heated, some oxyd of hon falls, and the fluid is light yellow ; with oxalic acid, a white earth separates, which, heated with sulphuric acid to destroy the oxalic acid, dissolves, and the fluid forms with potash before complete neutralization, a white double salt, which has the characters of that from zirconia, but may also contain oxyd of cerium. The oxalate when first formed did not afford when heated the cinnamon-brown color characteristic of deutoxyd of cerium. The extremely small amount of the mineral under examination forbids the expression of certainty re specting the base. Although inclining to the opinion of the existence of cerium in the mineral, from the red color of the crystals, Mr. Hayes observes that he obtained no positive proof on this point. PYROCHLORE.

Pyrochlore occurs imbedded in syenite at Fredericksvarn and Laurvig in Norway, as sociated with zircon, polymignite, and phosphate of yttria ; also at Brevig with thorite, and at Ilmengebirge near Miask in Siberia.

The microlite resembles pyrochlore closely, and has been referred to this species by J. E. Teschemacher, (Am. J. Sci. xliii, 33). It occurs in small octahedral crystals, translucent to opaque, and of light yellow and brown shades of color, associated with albite, green and red tourmaline, uran ite and columbite, at the Chesterfield vein, Massachusetts. The octahedrons occur' often with truncated edges, (fig. 9, pi. 1), and also with the angles replaced by four planes in clined on the octahedral faces, as in fig. 17, pi. 1. H.=55.

But as there are other bases present as well as lime, the true constitution of the species, Hayes states, is not probably represented correctly by either of these formulas. Hayes gives the following blowpipe characters, (Am. J. Sci. xliii, 33): In the outer flame fuses on the edges to an enamel, which in the reducing flame darkens and becomes finally of a clove color ; the outer flame restores again the former color. With borax on a platinum wire, fuses with slight effervescence ; and the outer flame gives a glass which is reddish-brown whde hot, but becomes pale yellow as it cools \u25a0 the globule in the reducing flame remains clear, and when cold is of a pale green color- on flaming * In this case the atomic weight of tantalum is 1531-15."], [415, "399 TITANATE3 COLUMBATES. a white enamel is produced.

The yttria and uranium of the Ihnen columbite, Hermann attributes to a mixture with samarskite. The Sin in the above analysis of Bromeis includes also yttria. H. Rose has discovered that in this species the columbic acid is more or less replaced by niobic and pelopic acids. The Bmen specimens, according to him, contain mostly niobic acid along with traces of pelopic and tungstic acids ; and this is also true of the Connecticut columbite. The Bodenmais mineral includes more pelopic acid, and hence its higher specific gravity. Specimens of the highest specific gravity at Bodenmais, give a black powder, and others of less gravity a dark reddish brown. The Limoges speci mens (analyses 11, 12) resemble those of Bavaria, in containing principally pelopic acid ; and Damour has proposed to adopt for this variety the name Baierine, whde the mobic variety has been called Niobite. . Wollaston's analysis was made on four grains of the original specimen in the British Museum, sent out from Connecticut by Gov. Winthrop to Sir Hans Sloane. B.B. alone, on charcoal, infusible. With borax, in powder, fusion takes place slowly but perfectly, forming a blackish-green glass. Columbite of Bodenmais, in Bavaria, and also of Rabenstein, near Zwiesel, in Bohemia, occurs in granite. In the United States it occurs both in feldspathic and albitic granite. The occurrence of columbite in America was first made known by Mr. Hatchett's examination of a specimen, sent by Gov. Winthrop to Sir Hans Sloane, then President of the Royal Society, which was labeled as found at Neatneague. D. S. L. Mitchill stated (Med. Repos. voL viii) that it was taken from a spring at New London, Conn. No local ity has since been detected at that place. But the rediscovery of it at Haddam, first pubhshed by Dr. Torrey, (Amer. J. Set iv, 52), has led to the belief that the latter was its original locahty. It has since been discovered more abundantly near Middletown. At Haddam it occurs in a granite vein, associated with chrysoberyl, beryl, and automo lite. Finer crystals come from a feldspar quarry near Middletown, along with albite. The above figure, 2, represents one of these crystals three quarters of an inch long ; its faces are sufficiently brilliant for the use of the reflecting goniometer. A crystal from this locahty, described by Professor Johnston, (Amer. J. Sci, xxx, 387), weighed, before it was broken, fourteen pounds. The part figured weighed six pounds and twelve ounces avoirdupois, and was about six inches in length and breadth. It exhibits the faces Iii, m, e, I', e, e, and another imperfect plane, which appears to be 6'. Chesterfield, Mass., has afforded Borne fine crystals, associated with blue and green tourmalines, and beryl, in granite ; also Acworth, N. H., but this locality is now apparently exhausted. It has also been observed at Beverly, Mass. ; at Plymouth, N. H., with beryl ; at Green- field, N. Y., with chrysoberyl. FERRO-TANTALITE. Tantalise. Columbate of Iron. Tamela-tantalite.

When pure per fectly soluble in muriatic acid. . Gray antimony occurs with spathic iron in beds, but generally in veins. It is often associated with blende, heavy spar, and quartz. It is met with in veins at Wolfsberg, in the Hartz, and at Posing, near Presburg in Hungary. Its most celebrated localities, however, are Felsobanya, Schemnitz, and Kremnitz in Hungary, where it often occurs in diverging prisms, several inches long, accompanied by crystals of heavy spar and other mineral species. In Dumfriesshire it occurs fibrous and laminated ; in Cornwall massive ; and compact at Magurka in Hun gary. Also abundant in Borneo. In the United States, it occurs at Carmel, Penobscot Co., Me., and at Cornish and Lyme, N. H. ; also at \" Soldier's Delight,\" Md. This ore affords nearly all the antimony of commerce. The crude antimony of the shops is obtained by simple fusion, which separates the accompanying rock. From this product most of the pharmaceutical preparations of antimony are made, and the pure metal extracted. This ore was employed by the ancients for coloring: the hah, eyebrows, eyelashes, and edges of the lids ; and as this last application was intended to increase the apparent size of the eye, they called the ore TrXarvdfBaXpoi,, from ir\\arvs, broad, and o^,8a>.iios, eye. According to Dioscorides, it was prepared for this purpose by enclosing it in a lump of dough and then burning it in the coals till reduced to a cinder. It was then extinguished with milk and wine, and again placed upon coals and blown till ignition ; after which the heat was discontinued, lest, as Pliny says, \" plumbum fiat,\" it become lead. From this we may infer that the metal antimony was occasionally seen by the ancients, though not recognized by them as distinct from lead. (Moore's An. Min., p. 52). BERTHIERITE, Poggendorf.

At Tajowa in Hungary, it occurs in beds of clay, and at St. Gothard in Switzerland, imbedded in dolomite, near Julamerk in Koordistan. It has also been observed in the Vesuvian lavas, in minute crystals. Strabo speaks of a mine of sandaraca (the ancient name of this species) at Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia.

Near Julamerk in Koordistan, there is a large Turkish mine. Small traces are met with in Edenville, Orange Co., N. Y., on arsenical hon. The name orpiment is a corruption of its Latin name aurigmentum, \"golden paint,\" which was so called in allusion to its color, and also because it was supposed to contain gold. It is used as a pigment, but is mostly prepared artificially for this purpose. V. CHROMIUM. The metal chromium is not found native. It occurs as chromic acid in combination with oxyd of lead, and as an oxyd with iron. The oxyd is associated with silica and alumina in some clayey compounds, possibly mere mechanical mixtures.

Its most abundant ores are the oxyds and sulphurets. Combined with carbonic acid (spathic iron) it is also of common occurrence. It is found united with various acids, with arsenic, and rarely with antimonial compounds. It is isomorphous with manganese, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and chromium, and hence the corresponding oxyds of these metals replace one another : consequently hydrous silicates of magnesia pass into hy drous silicates of protoxyd of iron, as seen in serpentine and allied com pounds ; while the anhydrous have the same relations as seen in chryso lite, hornblende, and augite. Again, silicates of alumina graduate into sil icates of peroxyd of iron. The carbonates of lime, magnesia, manganese, zinc and iron are similar in crystallization and structure, besides often shading into one another by a mutual substitution of bases. Iron, nickel, and cobalt are also isomorphous, and the sulphurets and aTseniurets of these metals are closely related crystallographically with those of iron. Peroxyd of iron (Pe) and peroxyd of titanium (\u00a5i) are likewise isomorphous, and unite in indefinite proportions under a common crystalline form ; so that specular and titanic iron crystallize alike."], [439, "423 IRON The ores of iron are widely disseminated. The oxyds arc the ordinary coloring ingredients of rocks, tinging them red, yellow, dull green, brown, and black. 1 . Native. IRON. Gediegen Eisen, W. and Z. Fer Natif, H. Mars, Alchcm. Monometric.

Sci. xii, 154, and [2], v, 292), where it is said to have been found in a vein or plate, two inches thick, attached to a mass of mica-slate rock. It contained graphite in the broad lamin\u00e6 into which it was divided ; and it had no obvious crystalline structure, nor was any developed by etching with nitric acid, as in most meteoric irons. Foreign specimens are also reported to have been found. Cramer describes one weigh ing four pounds, obtained in the mine of Hackenburg. It is said to have been observed in thin lamin\u00e6 in an iron stone conglomerate in Brazil and in lava in Auvergne. Meteoric iron usuaUy contains nickel, and smaU quantities of other metals. Dr. C. T. Jackson first pointed out the existence of chlorine as a constituent in some meteoric iron. (See Am. Jour. Sci. vol. xxxiv, p. 335). The foUowing analyses of meteoric iron are by BerzeUus, (K V.

The metaUic iron constituted only 1715 part of it. The second was discovered by Pallas on a mountain, between Kresnojarsk and Abekansk, in Siberia. It contained imbedded oUvine. The third is supposed to have faUen near the close of the fourteenth century ; it is preservd at Vienna. One of the most extraordinary of these iron meteorites, preserved m any coUection, is now in the Yale CoUege cabinet. It weighs 1635 lbs.; length three feet four inches; breadth two feet four inches ; height one foot four inches. It has been analyzed by C. U. Shepard, (Am. Jour. Sci. xvi, 217), also by B. SiUiman, Jr., and found to contain Iron 90*02 to 92*912, nickel 8*80 to 9*674. The crystalline structure of this iron is veiy remarkable as developed by nitric acid on a polished surface. Mr. SUliman has remarked that the nickel is segregated along the lines of crystaUization, and that it is not uniformly alloyed with the iron, as had been previously supposed (communicated to the author). It was brought from Red river. StUl more remarkable masses exist in South America ; one was discovered by Don Rubin de CeUs in the district of Chaco-Gualamba, whose weight was estimated at 30,000 lbs., and another was found at Bahia in Brazil, whose solid contents are at least twenty-eight cubic feet, and weight 14,000 lbs. The Siberian meteorite, discovered by Pallas, weighed originally 1600 lbs. and contained imbedded crystals of chrysoUte. SmaUer masses are quite common. Meteoric iron is perfectly malleable, and may be readUy worked into cutting instruments, and put to the same U6es as manufactured iron."], [440, "424 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. 2.

This variety tarnishes readily, assuming the bluish tarnish of steeL Iron pyrites occurs abundantly in rocks of all ages, from the oldest crystalline to the most recent alluvial deposits. It usually occurs in small cubes, but often modified as above described ; also in irregular spheroidal nodules and in veins, in clay slate, gray wacke slate, the coal formation, &c. Cubes of gigantic dimensions have been found in some of the Cornish mines ; pentagonal dodecahedrons and other forms occur on the island of Elba, sometimes three or four inches in diameter. Large octahedral crystals are found at Persberg in Sweden. Magnificent crystals have been brought from Peru ; but stdl more brilliant and well-finished crystals occur at Traversella in Piedmont. Alston Moor, Derbyshire, Cornwall, Faldun in Sweden, Kongsberg in Norway, are well known localities. The clay at Miinden, in Hannover, and the chalk at Lewes in Surry, have afforded some remarkable compound crystals. It has also been met with in the Vesuvian lavas in small irregular crystals. At Rossie, N. Y., polished crystals variously modified occur at the lead mine in green shale ; at Scoharie, a mde west of the court house in single and compound crystals, often highly polished and abundant ; in interesting crystals at Johnsburgh and Chester, War ren Co., N Y. ; in gneiss near Yonkers ; in Orange Co. at Warwick and Deerpark ; in Jefferson Co. in Champion, and near Oxbow on the banks of Vrooman lake, in modified octahedrons, (fig. 3, pi. 1) ; in limestone at Shoreham, Vt, crystals are abundant; at Lane's mine, Monroe, Conn., in small octahedral crystals ; in cubes in chlorite slate, at Orange and Mdford, Conn., and in mica slate at Stafford : in Massachusetts at Heath in handsome crystals ; in Maine at Corinna, Peru, Waterville, and Farmington : in Penn sylvania, in crystals, at Little Brittain, Lancaster Co.; at Chester, Delaware Co. ; in Car bon and York Cos. ; at Knauertown, Chester Co. ; in Cornwall, Lebanon Co., in lustrous cubo-octahedrons, and with an elegant steel tarnish, sometimes an inch through ; near French Creek, iu polished yellow octahedrons. Massive varieties are abundant in Con necticut in gneiss at Colchester, Ashford, Tolland, Stafford, and Union ; in Massachu setts at Hawley and Hubbardston ; in Maine at Bingham, (sawmills), Brooksvdle, and Jewell's Island ; in New Hampshire at Unity ; in New York in Franklin, Putnam, and Orange Cos., and elsewhere. This species affords the greater part of the sulphate of iron and sulphuric acid of com merce, and also a considerable portion of the sulphur and alum. It is also of impor tance in the smelting of ores, particularly those of sdver. Pyrites sometimes contains mechanically mingled, a minute quantity (perhaps one five thousandth part) of gold, and is then termed auriferous pyrites. It occurs abundantly in the gold mines of Beresof in Siberia, and in Brazd, in detached disintegrating crystals of a dark-brown color. The name pyrites is derived from the Greek, irvplrm, a term applied to this mineral, because, as Pliny states, \" there was much fire in it,\" as was made apparent by friction. This term was applied to flint and some siliceous millstones for a simdar reason. MARCASITE. Haid. White Iron Pyrites. White Bisulphuret of Iron. Radiated Pyrites Spear Pyrites. Hepatic Pyrites.

This species was formerly subdivided according to the different forms the mineral presents. Radiated pyrites included the radiated masses and more simple crystals ; spear pyrites, the macled crystals ; hej/atic pyrites, or leberkies, (so called from hirap, liver), the decomposed liver-brown tessular crystals, which were originally iron pyrites, and also certain hexagonal pseudomorphs ; cockscomb pyrites, or kammkics, the crest-like aggregations of this species of pyrites; cellular pytites, the cellular varieties, formed by the decomposition of crystals of galena, which contained films of pyrites between its layers, thus producing a honeycomb appearance. The spear pyrites occurs abundantly in the plastic clay of the brown coal formation, at Littmitz and Altsattell, near Carlsbad in Bohemia, and is extensively mined for its sul phur and the manufacture of the sulphate of iron. The radiated variety occurs at the same place ; also at Joachimstahl, and in several parts of Saxony. The cockscomb va riety occurs with galena and fluor spar in Derbyshire. It occurs in stalactitic concretions in Cornwall. The kyrosite ( Weisskupfererz, or arsenid of copper, as it has been called) is from the mine Briccius, near Annaberg. The Chilian Weisskupfererz contains, according to Plattner, 129 per cent, of copper, besides hon and sulphur, but no arsenic. (Breit. Pogg. lviii, 281). At Warwick, N. Y, it occurs in simple and compound crystals, imbedded in granite, and is associated with zircon. Hustis's farm, in Phillipstown, N. Y., affords small crys tals, referred by Beck to this species, occurring in magnesian limestone. Massive fibrous varieties abound throughout the mica slate of New England, and particularly at Cum mington, Mass., where it is associated with cummingtonite and garnet. It occurs also at Lane's mine, in Monroe, Conn., and in the topaz and fluor vein in Trumbull ; also in gneiss at East Haddam ; at Haverhill, N. H., with common pyrites. Cockscomb pyrites is employed in the manufacture of sulphur, sulphuric acid, and sul phate of iron, though less frequently than the common iron pyrites. Its color is consid erably paler than the ordinary pyrites, and it is also more liable to decomposition. Hydrous pyrites, or Wasserkies of the Germans.

The mass which is obtained on cooling, is magnetic and has a metallic crystalline structure, and a yellowish color on a surface of fracture. Dissolves in muriatic acid, excepting the sulphur. Crystalline plates of this species have been observed at Kongsberg in Norway, and at Andreasberg in the Hartz ; but they are of rare occurrence. It generally occurs massive, in fissures of crystalline rocks. Cleavable varieties accompany iolite at Bodenmais in Bohemia. The compact specimens are abundant in Cornwall, at Appin in Argyleshire, Saxony, Siberia, and the Hartz. It has also been observed in the lavas of Vesuvius, and in some meteoric stones. Trumbull, Conn., and the adjoining town of Monroe, afford the cleavable variety of this species ; at the former place it occurs in the topaz and fluor vein, at the latter in a quartz vein, in gneiss.

B.B. infusible alone, with borax it forms a green or yellow glass. Dissolves in heated muriatic acid. This species includes the old species specular iron and red iron ore, the latter uncrys tallized, and presenting the color of the former when in powder. Specular iron in cludes specimens of a perfect metallic lustre ; if the structure is micaceous, it is called micaceous iron. The varieties of a sub-metallic or non-metallic lustre, were included under the name of red hematite, fibrous red iron ; or if soft and earthy, red ochre, and when consisting of slightly coherent scales, scaly red iron, or red iron froth. Under this species must also be included different clay or argillaceous iron ores, many of which con tain but small portions of hon ; reddle or red chalk, the common drawing material, which has an earthy appearance and a flat conchoidal fracture ; jaspery clay iron, more firm in its structure than the preceding, and having a large and flat conchoidal fracture ; colum nar and lenticular argilh/ceous iron, distinguished by a columnar or flat granular structure. Specular hon occurs in crystalline rocks ; also among the ejected lavas of Vesuvius. Argillaceous ores form beds in secondary rocks. Fine specimens of this species are brought from the island of Elba, which has afforded it from a very remote period, and is described by Ovid as \" Insula inexhaustis chalybdum generosa metallis.\" The surfaces of the crystals often present an irised tarnish, and bril liant lustre. The faces a and a' are usually destitute of this tarnish and lustre, and may therefore assist, when present, in determining the situation of other planes when the crystal is quite complex. St. Gothard affords beautiful specimens, composed of crys tallized plates grouped in the form of rosettes, and accompanying crystals of feldspar. Near Limoges, France, it occurs in large crystals. Fine crystallizations are the result of volcanic actioD at Etna and Vesuvius, and particularly in Fossa Kankarone, on Monte Somma, where it forms crystalline incrustations on the ejected lavas. Arendal in Nor way, Langbanshyttan in Sweden, Framont in Lorraine, Dauphiny, and Switzerland, also afford splendid specimens of specular iron. Red hematite occurs in reniform masses of a fibrous concentric structure, near Ulverstone in Lancashire, in Saxony, Bohemia, and the Hartz. In Westphalia, it occurs as pseudomorphs of calcareous spar. In Brazil it is associated with quartz, and thus forms a rock called itaberite. Specular iron, both compact, micaceous, and jaspery, is abundant in St. Lawrence and Jefferson Cos., N. Y, at Gouverneur, Hermon, Edwards, Fowler, Canton, <fcc. Hand some irised crystallizations of specular iron are found at Fowler, in cavities in granular micaceous iron ore, associated often with splendid groups of quartz crystals. Other localities are Woodstock and Aroostook, Me., and Liberty, Md. It occurs also in the Blue Ridge, in the western part of Orange Co., Va. Micaceous hon in. large masses, composed of irregular curved lamin\u00e6, occurs at Hawley, Mass., and Piermont, N. H. ; also eight miles above Falmouth, Stafford Co., Va., on the Rappahannock river. Red he matite is found at Ticonderoga, upon Lake George. The two iron mountains of Missouri are situated about fourteen miles from the La Motte lead mines, and ninety miles south of St. Louis. They are conical hills, consisting of iron ore, \" in masses of all sizes, from a pigeon's egg to a middle size church.\" The ore is both massive and the micaceous va riety, with vast quantities of the red ochreous iron, about the one called the Pdot Knob. Lenticular argillaceous ore is abundant in Oneida, Herkimer, Maddison, and Wayne Cos., N. Y, constituting one or two beds, ten to twenty inches thick, in a compact sandstone. This ore affords a considerable portion of the hon manufactured in different countries. These varieties, especially the specular, require a greater degree of heat to smelt than other ores, but the iron obtained is of good quality. Pulverized red hematite is employ ed in polishing metals, and also as a coloring material. Specular hon is readily distin guished from magnetic hon ore, by its reddish streak."], [448, "432 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Hematite, a word in use among the ancients, was applied to this species on account of the red color of the powder, from aij/a, blood.

Rose has shown that the Ti (titanic acid) and Fe (protoxyd of iron) found in analyses, arise from an oxydation of the titanic oxyd (Ti) of the mineral, at the expense of the Pe, which takes place during the investigation. Berzelius confirms the view of Rose both on atomic grounds, and on that of the magnetism of the mineral. Rose shows that the specific gravity increases with the proportion of iron.

Magnetic iron ore occurs in beds in gneiss or syenite, also in beds or isolated crystals in clay slate, hornblende slate, chlorite slate, greenstone, basalt, and occasionally in lime atone. The beds of ore at Arendal and nearly all the celebrated iron mines of Sweden, consist of massive magnetic iron. Dannemora, and the Taberg in Smaland, are entirely formed of it. StiU larger mountains of it exist at Kurunavara and Gehvara, in Lapland. Fahlun in Sweden, and Corsica, afford octahedral crystals, imbedded in chlorite slate. Splendid dodecahedral crystals occur at Normark in Wermland. The most powerful native magnets are found in Siberia, and in the Hartz. They are also obtained on the island of Elba. Very extensive beds of magnetic hon occur in the counties of Warren, Essex, and Clin ton, New York, in granite, syenite, syenitic granite, or allied rocks ; and in Orange, Put nam, Saratoga, Herkimer counties, &c., in gneissoid granite, either in isolated masses or layers alternating with the layers of gneiss, (Beck) ; also in the mountainous districts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and on the eastern side of Willis mountain in Buckingham Co., Virginia.

A still more remarkable deposit exists at Stirling, in the same region, where it is associated with willemite, in a large vein, in which cavities occasionally contain crystals from one to four inches in diameter. The attempts to work this ore for zinc have proved unsuccessful. CHROMIC IRON. Chromite, Haid. Chromate of Iron. Chromiron. Chromeisenstein. Eisenchrom. Fer Chromate, H. Monometric.

Chromic iron occurs in serpentine, forming veins, or in imbedded masses. It assists in giving the variegated color to verd-antique marble. It occurs in the Gulsen mountains, near Kraubat in Styria ; also in the islands of Unst and Fetlar in Shetland ; in the Department du Var in France ; in Silesia and Bohemia ; abundant in Asia Minor, (Am. J. Sci. [41, ii, 126); in the Eastern Urals. At Baltimore, Md, in the Bare Hills, it occurs in large quantities in veins or masses in serpentine ; also in Montgomery county, six mdes north of the Potomac ; at Cooptown, Harford Co, and in the north part of Cecil Co, Md. In Pennsylvania, in W. Goshen, (cryst), Nottingham, Mineral Hill, and elsewhere ; Chester Co, near Unionville, abun dant ; near Texas, Lancaster Co, very abundant. It occurs both massive and in crystals at Hoboken, N. J, imbedded in serpentine and dolomite ; sparingly at Mdford and West Haven, Conn. ; in the southwestern part of the town of New Fane, and in Jay, Troy, and Westfield, Vt. ; Chester and Blanford, Mass. ; on I a Vache near Sau Domingo. This ore affords the oxyd of chrome, which, both alone and in combination with the oxyds of other metals, is extensively used in od-painting, dyeing, and in coloring porcelain. The ore employed in England is obtained mostly from Baltimore, Drontheim, and the Shetland Isles ; it amounts to about 2000 tons annually. LIMONITE, Beud. Brown Hematite. Brown Iron Ore.

Brown liematite includes compact mammillary and stalactitic varieties. Scaly and ochrey brown iron ore are decomposed earthy varieties, often soft like chalk ; yellow ochre is here included. Bog iron ore is a brittle or loosely aggregated submetalhc ore, occurring in low marshy grounds. It proceeds from the decomposition of other species, and often takes the form of the leaves, nuts or stems found in the marshy soil. Brown and yellow clay iron stone are hard and impure from admixture with clay or iron. Limonite occurs both in crystalline and secondary rocks, in beds and veins, associated at times with spathic iron, heavy spar, calcareous spar, arragonite, and quartz ; and it is often associated with ores of manganese. Found in Cornwall, Clifton, Sandloge in Shetland, in Carinthia and Bohemia, at Siegen near Bonn, and at Villa Rica in Brazil. The bog ore forms large beds in Germany, Poland, aud Russia."], [453, "IRON 437 This ore is abundant in the United States. We mention a few only of its localities, and would refer to the various geological reports for more complete lists. Extensive beds of hmonite, accompanied by the ochrey iron ore, exist at Salisbury and Kent, Conn, connected with mica slate ; also in the neighboring towns of Beekman, Fishkill, Dover, and Amenia, N. Y, and in a simdar situation north at Richmond and Lenox, Mass. At Hinsdale it is the cement in a conglomerate quartz rock. It is very abundant at Ben nington, Vt, also at Monkton, Pittsford, Putney, and Ripton, of the same State. Nan tucket and Martha's Vineyard are other localities ; also near Tinder's Gold Mine, Louisa Co, Va, there is an abundant deposit. The argdlaceous varieties are abundant in Penn sylvania, near Easton, and through the Lehigh range in Fayette Co, at Armstrong, Up per Dublin, and in Washington Co. In nodules from one inch to a foot in diameter, it is met with at Bladensburg, Md. ; also in gravel hills, near Marietta in Ohio. An argilla ceous ore is also found on Mount Alto, in the Blue Ridge, in Shenandoah Co, Va, and in Chatham and Nash Co, N. C. ; also near the Iron Mountains, Missouri. Limonite is one of the most important ores of iron. The pig hon, from the purer va rieties, obtained by smelting with charcoal, is readily convertible into steel. That yielded by bog ore is what is termed cold short, owing to the phosphorus present, and cannot therefore be employed in the manufacture of wire, or even of sheet iron, but is valuable for casting. The hard and compact nodular varieties are employed in polishing metallic buttons, &c. Kaliphite, Ivanoff. A mixture of brown iron ore, oxyd of manganese, and sdicate of zmc with lime, from Hungary.

Alone infusible. Colors borax green ; dissolves with difficulty in nitric acid, and scarcely effervesces, unless previously pulverized. Expo sure to the atmosphere darkens its color, rendering it often of a blackish-brown, or brownish-red color. Sparry iron occurs in many of the rock strata, in gneiss, mica-slate, clay slate, and in connection with the coal formation. It is often associated with metallic ores. At Frei berg it occurs in silver mines. At Cornwall it accompanies tin. It is also found accom panying copper and iron pyrites, galena, vitreous copper, (fee. In New York, according to Beck, it is almost always associated with specular hon. Occasionally it is to be met with in trap rocks. In the region in and about Styria and Carinthia, this ore forms extensive tracts in gneiss, which extend along the chain of the Alps on one side into Austria, and on the other into Saltzburg. At Harzgerode in the Hartz, it occurs in fine crystals in gray -wacke ; also in Cornwall, Alston Moor, and Devonshire. The Spheerosiderite occurs in greenstone at Hanau, and many other places. Clay iron stone, which is a mixture of carbonate of hon and clay, occurs in coal beds in the neighborhood of Glasgow ; also at Mouillar, Magescote, <fec, in France. At Roxbury, Conn, a vein of spathic iron occurs in quartz, traversing gneiss ; also obtained at Plymouth, Vt, and at Sterling, Mass. In small quantities it occurs at Mon roe, Conn., at Lane's mine ; also in rhombohedral crystals in New York, at the Sterling ore bed in Antwerp, Jefferson Co, and at the Rossie iron mines, St. Lawrence Co. The argillaceous carbonate in nodules and beds is abundant in the coal regions of Pennsyl vania, and many parts of the west. This ore is employed very extensively for the manufacture of iron and steel.

Allagite has a greenish-gray color, verging towards black, and is somewhat fibrous, resembling altered bustamite. Opsimose of Beudant, from Franklin, N. J, is the fowlerite partially altered. The dyssnite of Kobell, is from the same region and of simdar character. Thomson's analysis of fowlerite (Ann. Lye. N. Y, hi, 28) is from a partially altered specimen of this kind.

In Hermann's analysis the oxygen of the protoxyds is to that of the silica as 11-85 to 2538 ; and in Schlieper's as 1136 to 266 : the former gives the ratio 4 : 8-J ; the latter 4 to 9, characteristic of Hornblende. Through much of the ore, sihca is distributed at times in visible points or grains, and it is probable, as Schlieper states, that the excess of silica which makes the constitution that of hornblende rather than augite, is at tributable to this, a mechanical source. If the mingled sihca bears any proportion to the invisible carbonates, we need no other explanation. Schlieper found his specimen (one furnished by the author and seemingly pure) to consist partly of carbonate of manganese and other bases. By digestion in concen trated muriatic acid, the soluble portion of the mineral separates ; he thus obtained in one hundred parts 9015 of the silicate of manganese, and 9'85 soluble portioa The soluble portion afforded on anatyiis, MnC 50-62, Fe C 8-60 CaC 3717, Mg C 244, fl and loss 127=100.

The foreign variety on which this species was first instituted, occurs at Langban shytta, near Plhllipetadt in Sweden, in hon ore beds, in broad folia, and also granular massive ; also at Elbingerode, in the Hartz ; in the district of Ekatherinenburg, in Sibe ria ; with gray copper ore at Kapnik, in Transylvania. The fowlerite is found at the Franklin Furnace, Hamburgh, N. J, in granular lime stone with magnetic iron, franklinite, and garnet ; also at Stirling, N. J.

An ore from Stirling, New Jersey, gave Thomson the angle 123\u00b0 30', which is near the angle of hornblende, but we have not been able to verify the result. Thomson's analysis of this ore, if correct, would make it a manganese augite or Rhodonite, (Min. i, 515), Si 4210 Mn 50-72 Ee 616=99-88.

COBALT AND NICKEL The metals cobalt and nickel do not occur native. They are usually in combination with arsenic or sulphur, aud sometimes also with antimony and bismuth ; and as oxyds they are found combined with sulphuric and arsenic acids, and rarely with carbonic acid. The uncombined oxyds are not found excepting in an impure earthy state, and in this respect the metals are very unlike iron and manganese. Cobalt, when pure, is a brittle reddish-white metal ; G. = 8-53. Nickel is white and malleable ; G. = 827. 1. Sulphurets, Arseniurets, Antimoniurets. Among the following species there are many cases of isomorphism, and also of dimorphism ; and if we include the corresponding compounds of the allied metals, many instances of trimorphism may be pointed out. The sulphurets and arseniurets have been considered isomorphous by Frankenheim. Although this view seems incorrect, as shown by G. Rose, still there is an interesting parallelism between the groups. The analo gous compounds RS\u00b0 and RAs\u00b0, if the atomic weight of arsenic is halved, (or R S\u00b0 and R2 As\", if not halved, as adopted in the following pages), have a certain degree of relation in crystallization. The following table exhib its the groups of isomorphs that occur among these species, and also the cases of dimorphism. The species of any group, a, b, or c, are isomor phous ; and under any general division, I, II, &c, the species in the group a, are dimorphous with those of b, or trimorphous with those of b and e. We add in a second parallel column, for comparison, the corresponding compounds of other metals. The system of crystallization is indicated by Roman numerals.* * I. Monometric system. IV.

The varieties containing much iron have a high specific gravity. The last includes much nickel with the cobalt, and is therefore intermediate between this species and white nickel. B.B. on charcoal emits copious arsenical fumes, and melts to a white brittle metal he globule. It colors borax and other fluxes blue, and produces with nitric acid, a pink solution, depositing arsenous acid. Smaltine usually occurs in veins, accompanying other ores of cobalt and ores of sdver and copper ; also, in some instances, with copper nickel and mispickel. With silver and copper it occurs at Freiberg, Annaberg, and particularly Schneeberg in Saxony ; at Joachimstahl in Bohemia, the reticulated varieties are frequently found imbedded in calc spar ; also at Wheal Sparnon in Cornwall, and at Riechelsdorf in Hesse, in veins in the copper schist; at Tunaberg in Sweden, Allemont in Dauphine\". At Chatham, Conn., it occurs in veins traversing gneiss, associated with mispickel and copper nickel. The presence of copper nickel, which is a very common associate with this species, is the cause of no small annoyance to the miner ; for even a minute quantity suffices to destroy the fine blue color obtained from cobalt. The ore, when separated from this attendant, is roasted to drive off the arsenic, and finely pulverized, and is then prepared for giving the blue color employed in painting porcelain and stone-ware.

In these formulas, bismuth is taken at 13301. But it seems improbable, judging from the analogous compounds, that a compound of the constitution suggested by Frankenheim should' be monometric in crystallization, and espe cially as Rose has Bhown that bismuth is isomorphous with antimony and the allied metals, and therefore not with nickeL But the compounds of nickel, cobalt, \u00c6c, with arsenic and the allied, are partly tesseraL The proportion 1 : 10 : 14 for the bismuth, nickel, and sulphur, adopting 1330-4 as the number for bismuth, (equivalent to 1 : 20 : 28, with 2660-8), gives us the formula Ni3Bi3-|-14Ni3S3; and if arsenic (and therefore bismuth) is taken as isomorphous with sulphur, the formula is identical essentially with the first of linn\u00e6ite.

It has been occasionally observed associated with copper nickel in the cobalt mine at Chatham, Connecticut. ZINC AND CADMIUM. Zinc and Cadmium are not found native. Zinc occurs in combination with sulphur or oxygen, forming but three distinct native species ; be sides these, the oxyd forms native sulphates, silicates, and carbonates, and with oxyd of iron and magnesia enters into the constitution of Franklinite, (p. 435), and some varieties of Spinel, (p. 370)."], [495, "ZINC CADMIUM. 479 Cadmium is occasionally associated sparingly with zinc in its ores, and forms also a native sulphuret.

The variety containing more than 15 per cent, of protoxyd of iron is called Kapnite by Breithaupt ; according to this mineralogist, it has R : R=107\u00b0 7'. B.B. loses transparency, but does not melt ; carbonic acid is driven off, and oxyd of zinc is obtained or passes off in white flakes. Dissolves with effervescence in nitric acid. Calamine is found both in veins and beds, especially in company with galena and blende ; also with copper and iron. It usually occurs in calcareous rocks, and is generally associated with electric calamine. Fine specimens of calamine are. obtained at Nertschinsk in Siberia; one variety has a dark-brown color, and contains cadmium ; another is of a beautiful bright green. Other locahties are Dognatzka in the Bannat of Temeswar in Hungary, Bleiberg and Raibel in Carinthia, Altenberg, near Aix la Chapelle. Concentric botryoidal groups are met with in the Mendip hills, and at Wanlockhead in Dumfreisshire. In the United States, calamine is found in great abundance in Jefferson county, Mis souri, at a lead mine called Valle's diggings. Hamburg, near the Franklin furnace, New Jersey, the Perkiomen lead mine, Pennsylvania, and the lead mine at Brookfield, Conn., afford it in small quantities. At Franklin it occurs only in a pulverulent form, and results from the decomposition of red zinc ore. At a lead mine in Lancaster Co., Pa., it is abundant. ZINC BLOOM, Smithson. Dicarbonate of Zinc.

Galena occurs in beds and veins, both in crystalline and uncrystalline rocks. It is"], [505, "LEAD 489 often associated with blende, hon, and copper pyrites, the carbonate and other lead ores and occurs m a gangue of heavy spar, calc spar or quartz. At Freiberg in Saxony, it occupies veins in gneiss ; in Spain in the granite hills of Linares, and also m Catalonia, Grenada, and elsewhere; at Clausthal and Neudorf in the Hartz, and at Przibram in Bohemia, it forms veins in clay slate ; in Styria, it occurs in the same kind of rock in beds ; at Sala in Sweden, it forms veins in granular lime- stone ; through the gray-wacke of Leadhills and the Killas of Cornwall, are dissemina- ted veins of this ore ; and in mountain limestone, occur the rich repositories of Derby- shire, Cumberland, and the northern districts of England, as also those of Bleiberg, and the neighboring locahties of Carinthia. In the English mines it is associated with cal- careous spar, pearl spar, fluor spar, heavy spar, witherite, calamine, and blende ; other locahties are Joachimstahl, where it is worked principally for the silver ; in Bohemia southwest of Prague ; in the Daouria mountains, Siberia ; in Algeria ; near Cape of Good Hope ; in Australia. The most extensive deposits of this ore in the United States, are met with in Mis- souri, niinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The ore occurs in what has been called \" cliff\" limestone, associated with blende, calamine (\"dry-bone\" ofthe miners), carbonate and sulphate of lead, pyrites, and often an ore of copper and cobalt. The mines of Missouri were discovered in 1720, by Francis Renault and M. la Motte; they are situated in the counties of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison. The lead region of Wisconsin, according to D. D. Owen, comprises 62 townships in Wisconsin, 8 in Iowa, and 10 in Illinois, being 87 mdes from east to west, and 54 mdes from north to south Throughout this region there is scarcely a square mile in which traces of lead may not be found. The principal indications in the eyes of the miners, as stated by Mr. Owen, are the following : fragments of calc spar in the soil, unless very abundant, which then indicate that the vein is wholly calcareous, or nearly so ; red color of the soil on the surface, arising from the ferruginous clay in which the lead ore is often imbedded ; fragments of lead (\" gravel mineral\") along with the crum- bling magnesian hmestone, and dendritic specks distributed over the rock ; also a de- pression of the country, or elevation, in a straight line, or \" sink holes,\" or a peculiarity of vegetation in a linear direction, indicates often the course of a vein. The diggings seldom exceed 25 or 30 feet in depth. From a single spot, not exceeding 60 yards square, 3,000,000 lbs. of ore have been raised ; and at the new digging on the west branch of the Peccatonica, not over 12 feet deep, two men raised 2,000 lbs. per day ; and in one of the townships two men raised 16,000 lbs. in a day. 500 lbs. is the usual day's labor from the mines of average productiveness. The mines of the Upper Missis- sippi afford about 760,000 pigs annually, and those of Missouri 125,000 to 150,000 pigs. Galena occurs also at Cave-in-Rock, in Illinois, associated with fluor spar. A vein at Rossie, in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., traverses, nearly perpendicularly, the gneiss of the re- gion, varying from one to three or four feet in width. It contains also calc spar, iron, and copper pyrites, and some blende and celestine. Near Wurtzboro, Sullivan Co., a large vein occurs in millstone grit ; the ore is abundant and is associated with blende, iron and copper pyrites. The Ancram lead mines, Columbia Co., have afforded considerable lead, but are no longer worked. In Maine, veins of considerable extent exist at Lubec, where the ore is associated with copper pyrites and blende ; also less extensively at Blue Hill Bay, Bingham, and Parsonsfield : in New Hampshire at Eaton, with blende and copper pyrites, and also at Haverhill, Bath, and Tamworth ; in Vermont at Thetford. South- ampton, Leverett, and Sterling, Mass., afford small quantities of galena; also Austin's mines in Wythe Co., Walton's gold mine in Louisa Co., and other places in Virginia ; at Brown's Creek, and at Haysboro, near Nashville, it occurs with blende and heavy spar ; in the region of Chocolate river and elsewhere, and Lake Superior copper districts. Argentiferous galena occurs at Monroe, Ct ; Bath, Haverhill, Eaton, Shelburne, and other places in New Hampshire, (C. T. Jackson), and traces of silver occur in the lead of the Mississippi valley.

Copper is met with native, and in this state is not uncommon. Its usual ores are sulphurets and oxyds, the former being far most abundant. It is also found combined with arsenic, selenium, antimony, (often along with iron or silver), also with carbonic, sulphuric, phosphoric, arsenic, vanadic, and silicic acids ; also with chloiine. \u20acu (or Cu2) has been shown to be isomorphous with Ag, Pb, Fe, and other allied metals.

B.B. fuses readily ; on cooling, it is covered with a coating of black oxyd. Dissolves readily in nitric acid, with the extrication of the red fumes of nitrous acid, and produces a blue solution with ammonia. Copper occurs in beds and veins accompanying its various ores, and sometimes asso ciated with iron. It is frequently found in loose masses imbedded in the sod. In Siberia, and the island of Nalsoe, in Faroe, it is associated with fibrous mesotype, in amygdaloid, and though mostly disseminated in minute particles, sometimes branches through the rock with extreme beauty. Common in Cornwall, at many of the mines near Redruth ; and also in considerable quantities at the Consolidated mines, Wheal Buller, and others. Brazil, Chili, and Peru afford native copper ; a mass now in the museum at Lisbon, supposed to be from a valley near Bahia, weighs 2616 pounds. This metal has been found native throughout the red sandstone region of the United States, particularly in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and still more abundantly in New Jersey, where it has been met with at several different places, sometimes in fine crystal line masses, especially at Brunswick, Somerville, Schuyler's mines, and Flemingtoa One mass from near Somervdle, on the premises of J. C. Van Dyke, Esq., of Brunswick, weighed 78 pounds, and is said originally to have weighed 128. Near Brunswick a vein or sheet of copper, a line or so thick, has been traced for several rods. Near New Haven, Conn., a mass was formerly found weighing 90 pounds. But no known locality in the world exceeds in the abundance of native copper, the Lake Superior copper region, near Kewenaw Point. Masses of great size were observed in this district near the Ontanawgaw river by Mr. Schoolcraft in 1821, and a large boulder described by him, (Am. J. Sci. iii, 201), and weighing 3704 lbs., is now in Washington,"], [524, "508 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. wlhle another from the same vicinity, weighing 1S7 lbs., has been many years in the Yale College collections. One large mass recently laid open at the \" Cliff Mine\" has been estimated to weigh 80 tons ; it was a flat mass lying vertically in the rock as in a vein, and measured 50 feet long, 6 feet deep, and averaged 6 inches in thickness. This copper contains intimately mixed with it about j o per cent, of silver ; often this metal is in visible grains, lumps, or strings, and occasionally a mass of copper when polished, appears sprinkled with large silver spots, resembling, as Dr. Jackson observes, a porphy ry with its feldspar crystals. The copper occurs in trap or sandstone, near the junction of these two rocks, and has probably been produced through the reduction of copper ores by the heat of the trap when first thrown up. Copper is of very extensive apphcation in the arts. In the pure state, it is used for various utensds, the sheathing of ships, &c. Alloyed with zinc, it constitutes brass, and with tin it forms bell metal. A similar alloy, in different proportions, constitutes the material of which the ancients made their brass weapons and cutting instruments. The proportion in these instruments was about five of copper to one of tin, which is the ratio that affords an alloy of maximum hardness. 2. Combinations with Sulphur, Selenium, Arsenic, Antimony.

Siegen, massive, 2160 Scheerer infers from the structure of the specimens employed for his second analysis above, that the crystallization was monometric, and therefore that this sulphuret of cop per is dimorphous. Haiiy made the crystallization hexagonal, which appears to have been an error. B.B. in the outer flame melts, gives out fumes of sulphur, and emits glowing drops with a noise, coloring the flame at the same time blue. In the inner flame becomes covered with a coating and does not melt. On charcoal the sulphur is driven off, and a globule of copper remains. In heated nitric acid forms a green solution, and the buI phur is precipitated. Cornwall affords splendid crystals of this species, where it occurs in veins and beds with other ores of copper. It occurs also at Fassnetburn in Haddingtonshire, in Ayr shire, and in Fair Island, Scotland. The compact and massive varieties occur in Sibe ria, flesse, Saxony, the Bannat, <fec. In the United States, compact varieties occur in the red sandstone formation at Sims bury and Cheshire, Conn.; also at Schuyler's mines, N. Y. A vein at Bristol, Conn., af fords large and brilliant crystallizations, and the ore is profitably mined. In Virginia it occurs in the U. S. copper mine district, Blue Ridge, Orange Co. Between Newmar ket and Taneytown, Maryland, east of the Monocacey, associated with copper pyrites.

At the copper mine Bristol, Conn., it is abundant, and occurs in line crystallizations. At Cheshire, it is met with in small cubes, along with heavy spar, malachite, and vitreous copper. This species is a valuable ore of copper. Its name alludes to its liabdity to tarnish thus receiving a reddish hue.

After a continued heat it fuses to a globule which is magnetic. With borax affords pure copper. Dissolves in nitric acid, excepting the sulphur, forming a green solution. A drop of liquid ammonia changes it to a deep blue. Copper pyrites is the principal ore of copper at the Cornish mines, and 10 to 12,000 tons of pure copper are smelted annually from 150 to 160,000 tons of ore. It is there associated with tin, erubescite, copper glance, galena, gray copper, and blende. The copper beds of Fahlun in Sweden, are composed principally of this ore, which oc- curs in large masses, surrounded by a coating of serpentine, and imbedded in gneiss. At Rammelsberg, near Goslar in the Hartz, it forms a bed in graywacke slate, and is associated with hon pyrites, galena, blende, and minute portions of silver and gold. The Kurprinz mine at Freiberg, affords well defined crystals. It occurs also in the Bannat, Hungary, Thuringia ; in Scotland in Kirkcudbright and Wigtonshires, in Perth- shire and Invernessshire ; abundant also in South Australia. In the United States it occurs at the Southampton Lead Mines, Mass., at Turner's falls on the Connecticut, near Deerfield, and at Hatfield and Sterling, Mass. : in Ver- mont, at Strafford, where it is profitably worked ; and at Corinth, Waterbury, and Shrewsbury : in New Hampshire, at Franconia, in gneiss ; at Unity, on the estate of Jas. Neal ; at Warren, on Davis's farm ; at Eaton, two miles northeast of Atkins's tav- ern ; at Lyme, east of East village ; at Haverhill and elsewhere : in Maine, at the Lubec lead mines, and at Dexter : in New York, at the Ancram lead mine ; five miles from Rossie, beyond DeLong's mdls ; at the Rossie lead mine in crystals ; and in crystals and massive at the mine near Wurtzborough, Sulhvan Co. ; in Virginia, at the Phenix copper mines, Fauquier Co., and the Walton gold mine, Louisa Co. ; in the Catoctin Mts., Maryland, and between Newmarket and Taneytown. In Michigan it is not abun- dant ; but it occurs at Presque Isle, at Mineral Point, and in Wisconsin, where it is the prevailing ore. In Canada, in Perth, there is a good vein. Allan says, speaking of the CornwaU ores, \"Though copper pyrites occurs in vast profusion, it is by no means a rich ore ; what is picked for sale at Redruth rarely yielding 12, generaUy only 7 or 8, and occasionally so little as 3 or 4 per cent, of metal. In the latter case, such poverty of ore is only made up by its facdity of transport, the moderate expense of fuel, or the convenience of smelting. Its richness may in general be judged of by the color ; if of a fine yellow hue, and readily yielding to the hammer, it may be considered a good ore ; but if hard, and pale-yellow, it is assuredly a poor ore, being mixed with iron pyrites.\" Copper pyrites is readily distinguished from iron pyrites, which it somewhat resem- bles, by its inferior hardness ; it may be cut by the knife, whfle hon pyrites will strike fire with steel. The effects of nitric acid are also different. It differs from gold in being brittle, on account of which it cannot be cut off in slices, like the latter metal \u25a0 and moreover gold is not attacked by nitric acid.

Volborthite was first discovered by Volborth, with copper ores, in the collection of Dr. Rauch, and is supposed to have come from the mines between Miask and Katherin enberg. Also found at Friedericksrode in Thuringia. A vanadate of copper (=CuV) has been reported as occurring in the Ural at Woss kressensk with native copper, copper glance, and malachite.

With both blowpipe and acid tests the presence of vanadium was as certained by him. A. A. Hayes has confirmed these results and formed from the mineral the vanadates of lead and sdver by double decomposition. The color of the mineral is a dark chocolate, and also a bright yellow. The exact state of composition of the van adic acid is still doubtful. There is no oxyd of lead in the ore, and the brown variety is mixed with an earthy oxyd of hon ; when carefully separated from the gangue, it was found to contain no copper. BEAUMONTITE.

Mercury exists in the native state, but occurs mostly as a sulphuret, (cinnabar). It is also found combined with chlorine, iodine, silver, and gold, but very sparingly. It has been observed in some gray copper ore, (see page 514), replacing apparently the copper or silver. QUICKSILVER. Native Mercury. Gediegen Quecksilber. Mercure Natif, H. Hy- drargyrum.

Its most important mines are those of Idria in Carniola, and Almadeii in Spain. At Idria it occurs interspersed through a kind of clay slate, from which it is obtained by washing. It is found in small quantities at Wolfstein and Mors feld, in the Palatinate, in Carinthia, Hungary, Peru, and other countries ; also at Peyrat le Chateau, in the department of the Haute Vienne, in a disintegrated granite, unaccom panied by cinnabar. Mercury is used for the extraction of gold and sdver ores, and is exported in large quantities to South America. It is also employed for mirrors, for thermometers and barometers, for percussion powders, and for various other purposes connected with med icine and the arts. The common name of tliis metal, quicksdver, is a translation of the old name, argen- tum vivum. AMALGAM. Mercure argentif, H. Naturlich Amalgam, W. Monometric.

The hepatic cinnabar or liver ore is an impure variety ; it sometimes affords a brownish streak in consequence of its impurities, and is occasionally slaty, though commonly gran ular or impalpable in structure. Cinnabar occurs in beds in slate rocks, and rarely in granite or porphyry. It has been observed in veins, with ores of iron. Good crystals occur in the coal formations of Moschellandsberg and Wolfstein in the Palatinate ; also in Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. The most important beds of this ore are at Almaden in Spain, and at Idria in Carniola, where it is usually massive. It occurs at Richenau in Upper Carinthia ; in beds traversing gneiss at Dunbrawa in Transylvania; in gray wacke at Windisch Kappel in Carinthia ; at Neumarktel in Carniola ; at Ripa in Tuscany ; at Schemnitz in Hungary ; in the Urals and Altai ; in China abundantly, and in Japan ; at San Onofre, in Mexico ; at Huanca Velica in Southern Peru, abundant ; in the Province of Coquimbo at Guallilinga and Punitaqui ; and forming extensive mines in California. The California beds occur at New Almaden, in a mountain to the south of San Jose, between the Bay of Francisco and Monterey. This ore is very abun dant, and of easy access. The variety corallinerz, from Idria, has a curved lamellar structure. This ore is the great source of the mercury of commerce, from which it is obtained by sublimation. When pure it is identical with the manufactured vermilhon of commerce, which is a valuable pigment. It was highly esteemed for its brilliancy of color by the ancients, and was employed as a paint for various sacred purposes. NATIVE CALOMEL. Horn Quicksflver. Muriate of Mercury.

Silver is common native, and also in combination with sulphur, antimo ny, or chlorine. It occurs, besides, combined with iodine, bromine, sele nium, tellurium, bismuth, and mercury. There is one native salt, the carbonate. A small percentage of silver is often found in galena, and some ores of copper. 1. Native SILVER. Gediegen Silver, W. Argent Natif, H. Monometric.

Fordyce found in an alloy, silver 72, gold 28 ; and Klaproth, silver 36, gold 64 ; and under gold, many other combinations of these metals are given. John detected 1 per cent of antimony in silver from Johanngeorgenstadt, besides traces of copper and arsenic. A bismuth-silver from Copiapo, S. A., contained 16 per cent, of bismuth. B.B. fuses rather easdy, and often crystallizes on cooling. Soluble in nitric acid, and again deposited by a plate of copper. Native sdver occurs principally in arborescences and filiform shapes, in veins of calca reous spar or quartz, traversing gneiss, slate, and other ancient rocks. The structure of these forms is sometimes quite peculiar ; they being composed of one or more series of octahedrons, either closely united or arranged perpendicularly in straight rows. This structure is apparent in most of the Norwegian and Mexican varieties. The mines of Kongsberg in Norway, have afforded magnificent specimens of native sdver. One specimen among the splendid suite from this locality in the royal collection at Copenhagen, weighs upwards of 5 cwt, and recently two masses have been obtained weighing severally, 238 and 436 pounds. The principal Saxon locahties are at Frei berg, Schneeberg, and Johanngeorgenstadt ; the Bohemian, at Przibram, and Joachim stahL It also occurs in small quantities with other ores, at Andreasberg, in the Hartz, in Suabia, Hungary, at Allemont in Dauphiny, in the Ural near Beresof, in the Altai at Schlangenberg, and in some of the Cornish mines. A mine on the estate of Alva, in Stirlingshire, about the middle of last century, afforded \u00a340,000 or \u00a350,000 of sdver ; but it was long since abandoned. Mexico and Peru are at present the most productive countries in silver. In Mexico it has been obtained mostly from its ores, while in Peru it occurs principally native. A Mexican specimen from BatopUas weighed when obtained 400 pounds ; and one from Southern Peru, (mines of Huantaya), weighed over 8 cwt. During the first eighteen years of the present century, more than 8,180,000 marks of sdver were afforded by the mines of Guanaxuato alone. Of the 8,000,000 sterling, which it is calculated is the value of sdver annually afforded by the mines of the world, about two-thirds are ob tained from Mexico. In the United States it is disseminated through much of the copper of Michigan, and is found in considerable abundance. It has been observed at a mine a mile south of Sing Sing prison, which was formerly worked for silver ; at the Bridgewater copper mines, New Jersey ; in interesting specimens at King's mine, Davidson Co., N. C. The uses of sdver, as a material for coins, also in the manufacture of plate and va rious articles of luxury, are well known. For coinage it is alloyed with copper, by which it is rendered harder, and consequently more durable ; in the United States, 1000 parts of alloy contain 100 of copper. It is less malleable than gold, and cannot be beaten into unbroken leaves thinner than the one hundred and sixty thousandth part of an inch, which is more than one-third thicker than gold leaf. 2.

This important ore of silver occurs in Europe, principally at Annaberg, Joachimstahl, and other mines of the Erzgebirge, at Schemnitz and Kremnitz in flungary, and at Freiberg. At the last place it accompanies other silver ores, in veins traversing gneiss. It is abundant also in Mexico and Peru. A mass of sulphuret of silver is stated by Troost to have been found in Sparta, Ten nessee ; it also occurs with native silver and copper in Northern Michigan. A silver ore not yet analyzed, occurs, according to Jackson, with gray antimony, at Cornish, N. H.

Acts slightly on the mag net ; but this property depends on the amount of iron it contains. Platinum was first found in pebbles and small grains, associated with iridium, rho dium, osmium, palladium, gold, copper, and chrome, in the alluvial deposits of Brazd, Choco, and Barbara, in South America, where it received its name, platina, from plata, silver, of which word platina is a diminutive. It has of late years been discovered in considerable abundance at Nischne Tagilsk, and Goroblagodat, in the Ural. It occurs here as elsewhere in alluvial or drift material ; but the courses of the detritus have been traced to a great extent up Mount La Martiane, which consists of crystalline rocks. It has been formed into coins of eleven and twenty -two rubles each, by the Russians. They are not a legal tender, but pass conventionally, and are principally current in the southern provinces of the empire. Russia affords annually about 800 cwt of platinum, which is nearly 10 times the amount from Brazil, Columbia, St. Domingo, and Borneo. The amount coined from 1826 to 1844, equals 2\\ millions of dollars. Platinum is also found on Borneo ; in the sands of the Rhine ; in those of the river Jocky, St. Domino-o ; and recently in the Cahfornia gold region, and in traces with gold in Rutherford Co.', North Carolina. Borneo affords 600 or 800 pounds per vear. Although platinum generally occurs in quite small grains, masses are sometimes found of considerable magnitude. A mass, weighing 1088 grains, was brought by Humboldt from South America, and deposited in the Berlin museum. Its specific gravity was 1894. In the year 1822 a mass of platinum from Condoto was deposited in the Madrid museum, measuring two inches and four lines in diameter, and weighing 11,641 grains. A more remarkable specimen was found in the year 1827, in the Ural, not far from the Demidoff mines, which weighed 10 |A Russian pounds, or 11-57 pounds troy, and Bimdar masses are not now uncommon ; the largest yet seen weighed 21 pounds troy and is in the Demidoff cabinet. The alluvial deposits afford 1 to 3 pounds of platinum for 3700 of sand. l The infusibdity of this metel, and its property of resisting the action of the ah and moisture, and nearly all chemical agents, render it highly valuable for the construction"], [563, "PLATINUM IRIDIUM. 547 of philosophical and chemical apparatus. The vessels employed in the concentration of sulphuric acid are now made of platinum, which is unaffected by this corrosive acid. Platinum is also employed for crucibles and capsules in chemical analysis ; for covering other metals, and for painting on porcelain. It admits of being drawn into wire of ex treme tenuity. Dr. Wollaston succeeded in obtaining a wire not exceeding the two thousandth of an inch in diameter. The metal platinum was first discovered by Ulloa, a Spanish traveler in America, in the year 1735. For many years after its discovery, it was almost useless on account of the difficulty of obtaining it in masses. The grains weld when heated, but because of their small size, this was interminable labor, and moreover the metal was not pure. Dr. Wollaston introduced the process now in use, which consists in dissolving the metal in nitro-muriatic acid, and throwing down from the solution an orange precipitate by means of muriate of ammonia. This precipitate (a double chlorid of platinum and ammo nium) is then heated and thus reduced to the metallic state ; the platinum is now in an extremely minute state of division. This black powder (\" spongy platinum\") is next compressed in steel moulds by the aid of heat and strong pressure ; and when sufficient ly compact, is forged under the hammer and then reduced at last to solid masses. This metal fuses readily before the \" compound blowpipe ;\" and Dr. Hare succeeded in 1837 in melting twenty eight ounces into one mass. The metal was almost malleable and as good for working as that obtained by the other process ; it had a specific gravity of 19-8. He afterwards succeeded in obtaining from the ore masses which were 90 per cent, platinum, and as maUeable as the metal in ordinary use, though somewhat more liable to tarnish, owing to some of its impurities.

Composition. \u2014 Palladium, alloyed with a little platinum and iridium. Infusible alone before the blowpipe, but fuses readily with sulphur. By continuing the heat, the sul phur is driven off, and a globule of palladium obtained. Palladium occurs with platinum, in Brazil. Quite large masses of the metal palla dium are brought from Brazil. It is extracted from the auriferous sands by first fusing it with silver, and consequently forming a quaternary alloy of gold, palladium, sdver and copper, which is granulated by projecting it into water. By means of nitric acid all but the gold is dissolved ; and from the solution, the silver is first precipitated by common salt as an insoluble chlorid, and then, after separating the chlorid, the palla dium and copper are precipitated by plates of zinc. This precipitate is redissolved in nitric acid, an excess of ammonia added, and then hydrochloric acid sufficient to satu rate ; a double chlorid of palladium and ammonium is deposited as a crystalline yellow powder, which on calcination produces spongy palladium. The metal is malleable and when polished has a splendent steel-like lustre, which does not tarnish. A cup weighing 3t pounds was made by M. Breant for the mint of Paris, and is now in the garde-meuble of the French government. One part fused with six of gold forms a white alloy ; and this compound was employed at the suggestion of Dr. Wollaston, for the graduated part of the mural circle, constructed by Troughton for the Royal Observatory at Green wich. It has been employed for balances and mathematical and surgical instruments. The Selenpalladite of Zinken from Tilkerode has been acknowledged by him to be na tive palladium. The Eugenesite of Zinken, from the same locality, contains, according to this author, palladium, silver, and gold, with selenium. Rammelsberg suggests that the selenium may proceed from a mechanical mixture with selenid of lead. PALLADIUM OCHRE. Palladiumoxydul.

The Chilian gold afforded Domeyko 84 to 96 per cent, of gold, and 15 to 3 per cent. of silver, (Ann. d. Mines, [4], vi). Copper is occasionally alloyed with gold, and also palladium and rhodium. A Bra- zilian specimen of Palladium gold (Porpezite) from a place called Porpez, afforded Berzelius, Gold 85-98, palladium 95'8, silver 4-17. Rhodium gold has the specific gravity 16-6 \u2014 16-8. It is brittle and contains, accord- ing to Del Rio, 34 to 43 per cent, of rhodium. Native gold is largely obtained from alluvial washings. It is also found disseminated in certain rocks, especially the quartz veins that intersect talcose, mica, and argillaceous schists. It is sometimes found also in gneiss, granite, and porphyry. It is often con- tained in pyrites, constituting the auriferous pyrites ; the detritus affording gold dust has proceeded from some gold-bearing-rocks. Gold is widely distributed over the globe. It occurs in Brazil, (where formerly a greater part of that used was obtained), along the chain of mountains which runs nearly parallel with the coast, especially near Villa Rica, and in the province of Minas Geraes ; in New Grenada at Antioquia, Choco, and Giron ; in Chili ; sparingly in Peru ; in Mexico ; in New Mexico, near Santa Fe, Cerillos, Avo; in Guatemala, and near Panama; in the Rocky Mountains, near the Great Salt Lake ; in California, between the Sierra Nevada and the Sacramento and San Joaquim ; in the southern of the United States. In Eu rope it is most abundant in Hungary at Konigsberg, Schemnitz, and Felsobanya, and in Transylvania at Kapnik, Vorospatak, and Offenbanya ; it occurs also in the sands of the Rhine, the Reuss and the Aar ; on the southern slope of the Pennine Alps from the Simplon and Monte Rosa to the valley of Aosta ; in Piedmont ; in Spain, former.ly worked in Asturias ; in many of the streams of Cornwall ; near Dolgelly and other parts of North Wales ; in Scotland, in considerable amount, near Leadhills, and in Glen Coich and other parts of Perthshire ; in the county of Wicklow, Ireland ; in Sweden at Edelfors. In the Urals are valuable mines at Beresof, and other places ou the eastern or Asiatic flank of this range, and the comparatively level portions of Siberia ; also in the Altai mountains. Also in the Cailas mountains in Little Thibet. There are mines in Africa at Kordofan, between Darfour and Abyssinia; also south of Sahara in the western part of Africa, from the Senegal to Cape Palmas ; also in the in- terior on the Somat, a day's journey from Cassen; also along the coast opposite Mada-"], [567, "GOLD 551 gascar, between 22 and 35 degrees south latitude, supposed to have been the Ophir of the time of Solomon. Other regions are China, Japan, Formosa, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, western coast of Borneo, and the Phillippines. Nearly all the gold of commerce comes from Asiatic Russia, Brazil, Bohemia, and Transylvania, Africa, the East India Islands, and the United States : the whole amount annually obtained has been estimated at 36 tons. The Russian mines have recently been the most productive in the world. They are prin cipally alluvial washings, and these washings seldom yield less than 65 grains of gold for 4000 pounds of soil ; never more than 120 grains. The alluvium is generally most productive where the loose material is most ferruginous. The mines of Katherinenburg are in the parent rock \u2014 a quartz constituting veins in a half decomposed granite called \" beresite,\" which is connected with talcose and chloritic schists. The shafts are sunk vertically in the beresite, seldom below 25 feet, and from them lateral galleries are run to the veins. These mines afforded between the years 1725 and 1841, 679 poods of gold, or about 30,000 pounds troy. The whole of the Russian mines yielded in 1842, 970 poods of gold, or 42,000 pounds troy, half of which was from Siberia, east of the Urals. In 1843, the yield was nearly 60,000 pounds troy, or about $13,000,000 ; in 1845, it amounted to $13,250,000 ; and in 1846, to 1722-746 poods, equal to 75,353 troy pounds, and $16,500,000. At the Transylvania mines of Vorospatak, the gold is obtained by mining, and these mines have been worked since the time of the Romans. The annual yield of Europe, exclusive of Russia, is not above $1,000,000. Austria afforded in 1844, 6785 marks. The sands of the Rhone, Rhine, and Danube, contain gold in small quantities. The Rhine has been most productive between Bale and Man heim; but at present only $9000 are extracted annually. The sands of the richest quality contain only about 56 parts of gold in a hundred millions : sands containing less than half this proportion are worked. The whole amount of gold in the auriferous sands of the Rhine is estimated at $30,000,000, but it is mostly covered by soil under cultivation. Africa yields annually at least 4500 pounds troy, ($850,000), and Southern Africa, 1250 pounds, ($235,000). The mines of South America and Mexico were estimated by Humboldt to yield an nually about $11,500,000; but the amount has much diminished. Brazil of late has furnished about 17,500 pounds troy. It is estimated that between 1790 and 1830, Mex ico produced $31,250,000 in gold, Chili $13,450,000, and Buenos Ayres $19,500,000, making an average annual yield of $16,050,000. The mines of the Southern United States have produced of late about a million of dol lars a year. They are mostly confined to the States of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, or along a line from the Rappahannock to the Coosa in Alabama. But the region may be said to extend north to Canada ; for gold has been found at Canaan, N. H., Dedham. Mass., Albion, Maine, and on the Chaudiere river in Canada. In Virginia, the principal deposits are in Spotsylvania county, on the Rappahannock, at the United States mines and at other places to the southwest ; in Stafford county, at the Rappahannock gold mines, ten miles from Falmouth; in Culpepper county, at the Culpepper mines, on Rapidan river ; in Orange county, at the Orange grove gold mine, and at the Greenwood gold mines ; in Goochland county, at Moss and Busby's mines ; in Louisa county, at Walton's gold mine ; in Buckingham county, at Eldridge's mine. In North Carolina, the gold region is mostly confined to the three ranges of counties be tween Frederick and Charlotte, which are situated about in a line running northeast and southwest, parallel nearly with the coast. The mines of Mecklenburg are principally vein deposits ; those of Burke, Lincoln, and Rutherford, are mostly in alluvial soil. The Davidson county silver mine had afforded $7000 of gold in 1844. In Georgia, the Shelton gold mines in Habersham county have long been famous ; and many other places have been opened in Rabun and Hall counties, and the Cherokee country. In South Caroli na the principal gold regions are the Fairforest in Union district, and the Lynch's creek and Catawba regions, chiefly in Lancaster and Chesterfield districts ; also in Pickens county, adjoining Georgia. There is gold also in eastern Tennessee. _ Viewing the gold region of the United States as a whole, it is perceived that it ranges along the Appalachians, particularly the eastern slope, from Maine to Alabama, having nearly a northeast and southwest course. . The California mines are mostly alluvial. The gold is found in the gravel and sand of the valleys, and beds of streams leading from the Sierra Nevada into the adjoining valley ofthe Sacramento and San Joachim. Pebbles of quartz abound over the region, and magnetic hon sand is also abundant. AU the tributaries of these rivers have their"], [568, "552 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. auriferous sands, and the dry valleys and gorges, (runs of water only in the wet season), also yield abundantly. In the higher country, or along the dry ravines, the gold is in larger pieces, or grains, and occasionally cavities in the surface of the subjacent rocks, (called pockets), are laid open, which afford large quantities of the metaL Lower down the streams, the gold is in finer grains, usually flattened scales, a form which partly re- sults from the condition in lamin\u00e6 in the original rock, and partly from the trituration the grains are subjected to among the gravel under the action of running water ; for as in other regions of alluvial gold, the auriferous earth, or gravel, has resulted from the wear of auriferous rocks, and water has been some way concerned in producing, trans- porting, and distributing it The gold being specifically four or five times heavier than ordinary pebbles, it settles high up the streams, and only the small particles are carried far below. The scales have been observed by Mr. J. E. Teschemacher to be sometimes hexagonal plates. Zircons have been observed in the auriferous sands, and both platinum and diamonds have been reported. The gold rock of the United States is to a great extent a micaceous or talcose 6chist, with veins or beds of quartz. The gold is mostly confined to these veins, though also found to some extent in the rock either side. The schist is often half decomposed or rusted. The quartz is usually more or less cellular, or wanting in perfect compactness, and sometimes tabular ; yet it is at times quite solid. Iron pyrites is frequently pres- ent, and by decomposition it stains the rock with iron rust. Other minerals often asso- ciated with the gold, are copper pyrites, blende, galena, anglesite, zircons, sulphur, (in minute crystals, proceeding from the decomposition of pyrites). Heavy spar is some- times a large constituent of the vein, and fluor spar is now and then present. The pecu- liar appearance of the quartz, somewhat cellular, more or less rusted, and its position in veins, though an imperfect shale, and generally not firmly attached to the enclosing walls, afford the best indications of the presence of gold, though the absence of all these con- ditions is not evidence that no gold is to be found. The grains of gold may sometimes be seen in the cavities of the quartz, or it sparkles on a surface of fracture. But very commonly a mass of quartz that shows nothing to the eye, yields gold on trial. The same kinds of rock and veins of quartz were observed by the author in 1842 near the Umpqua river, Southern Oregon, and pebbles from similar rocks were met with along the Sacramento ; and the resemblance to other gold districts was remarked at the time ; but there was no opportunity for exploring the country where gold has since been found. Masses of gold of considerable size have been found in North Carolina. The largest was discovered in Cabarras Co. ; it weighed twenty-eight pounds avoirdupois, (\" steel- yard weight,\" equals 37 lbs. troy), and was 8 or 9 inches long by 4 or 5 broad, and about an inch thick. The largest mass yet reported from California weighed 20 pounds. In Paraguay, pieces from 1 to 50 pounds weight were taken from a mass of rock which fell from one of the highest mountains. Several specimens weighing 16 pounds have been found in the Ural, and one of 27 pounds ; and in the valley of Taschku Targanka, in 1842, a mass was detached, weighing very nearly 100 pounds troy. This mass is now in the Museum of the Institute of Mining Engineers at St Petersburgh. An examination of a gold rock for gold is an extremely simple process. The rock is first pounded up fine aud sifted ; a certain quantity of the sand thus obtained is washed in a shallow iron pan, and as the gold sinks, the material above is allowed to pass off into some receptacle. The largest part of the gold is thus left in the angle of the pan; by a repetition of the process a further portion is obtained ; and when the bulk of sand is thus reduced to a manageable quantity, the gold is amalgamated with clean mercury ; the amalgam is next strained to separate any excess of mercury, and finally is heated and the mercury expelled, leaving the gold. In this way, by successive trials with the rock, the proportion of gold is quite accurately ascertained. It is the same process used with the larger washings, though on a small scale. Mercury unites readily with gold, and thus separates it from any associated rock or sand ; and it is employed in all exten sive gold washings, though much gold may be often obtained by simple washing without amalgamation. The operation of hand washing is called in Virginia panning. With a small iron pan, they wash the earth in a tub or in some brook, and thus extract much gold from the gravel or soil, which is said to pan well ox pan poorly, according to the result. Masses of quartz, with no external indication of gold, examined in the above way at a Virginia mine, afforded an average of more than eight dollars to the bushel of gold rock. When gold is alloyed with copper or silver, the mode of assay for separating the cop per depends on the process of cupellation ; and that for separating the sdver, on the power of nitric acid to dissolve silver without acting on gold. The process of cupellation consists in heating the assay in a small cup, (called a cu-"], [569, "GOLD 553 pel), made of bone ashes, (or in a cavity containing bone ashes), while the atmosphere has free access. The heated metal is oxydated by the air passing over it, and the oxyd formed smks into the porous cup, leaving the precious met al behind. Tlie shape of the cupel is shown in fig. 1. In order to fuse the alloy and stiU have the atmosphere circu lating over it, the cupel is placed in a small oven-shaped vessel, called a muffle, (fig. 2); it is of infusible stone-ware, and has a number of oblong holes, through which to admit the flame from the fire, and give exit to the atmosphere which passes into it. The muffle is inserted in a hole fit ting it in the side of a vertical furnace, with the open mouth outward and even nearly with the exterior surface of the furnace. The fire is made within the furnace, below, around, and above ; and after heating up, tbe cupel is put :_ __.- -xa :__. _t_ \u00ab r. 1 ,,r ,r , r .. in the muffle with the assay in its shallow cup-shaped cavity. It thus has the heat of the furnace to fuse the assay, and the air at the same time is drawn in over it through the large opening of the muffle. The oxygen of the atmosphere unites with the lead of the assay, and produces an oxyd, which oxyd sinks into the cupel, leaving the silver or gold behind. The completion of the process is at once known by the change oi the as say suddenly to a bright shining globule. In the cupellation of gold containing copper, lead is melted with the assay. The lead on being fused in a draft of air oxydizes, and also promotes the oxydation of the copper, and both oxyds disappear in the pores of the cupel, leaving the gold behind, and the sdver alloyed with it. In this process the gold is melted with three times its weight of sdver, (a quartation, as it is termed, the gold being one part out of the four of the alloy), in order by its diffusion to effect a more complete removal of tie silver as well as the contained copper. The cupel is placed in the heated furnace, and the gold, silver, and lead, on the cupel ; the heat is continued until the surface of the metal is quiet and bright, when the cupellation is finished ; the metal then is slowly cooled and removed. The button obtained, after anneahng it by bringing it to a red heat, is rolled out into a thin plate and boded in strong nitric acid. This process is repeated two or three times with a change of the acid each time, and the sdver is thus finally removed. At the United States mint, half a gramme of gold is submitted to assay. The assay-gold and quartation-sdver are wrapped in a sheet of load weighing about ten times as much as the gold under assay. After cupellation, tie plate of gold and silver, loosely rolled in to a cod, is boded for 20 minutes in 4} o\u00bb- of nitric acid, of 20 to 22\u00b0 Beaum\u00c6 ; the acid is then poured off and another portion \u00abf stronger acid is added, about half the former quantity, and boded ten minutes ; tien the same again. The gold thus purified is washed and exposed to a red heat, ibr the purpose of drying and annealing it, and then weighed. The uses of gold are wel! known ; and also that it owes a great part of its value to its extreme malleability, snd the fact of its not tarnishing on exposure. Although a costly metal, it is one of the cheapest means of ornament, on account of the thinness of the leaves into which ti is beaten. A grain of the metal may be made to cover 56f square inches of surface, and the thinnest leaf is but 1,280,000th of an inch thick. Perfectly pure gold is denominated gold of 24 carats, or fine gold. If it contains 22 parts of pure gold to 2 of sdver, or 1 of copper and one of silver, it is said to be 22 carats fine \u25a0 to also for 20 carats fine, it contains 20 parts of pure gold. The carat is divided into i. i, *n;> uV Parts, for a more minute specification of the quantity of gold. The standard gold of the United States consists of 900 parts of gold to 100 of an al loy of copper and sdver. The eagle (10 dollars) contains 232 grains of fine gold. 70"], [570, "554 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. GRAPHIC TELLURIUM. Sylvanite, Haid. Graphic Gold. Schriftcrz.

Another in the kino-dom of Ava, India, is nearly as large as a child's head ; it is intersected by veins of carbonate of lime, from the thickness of paper to one twentieth of an inch. It is employed for the manufacture of a varnish, and for obtaining succinic acid and od of amber, which it affords at a low temperature. COPALINE, Hausmann.

There are also earthy varieties, called earthy and slaggy mineral pitch. Petroleum is a dark-colored fluid variety, containing much naphtha. Maltha or Mineral tar is a more viscid variety. Asphaltum is abundant on the shores of the Dead Sea. It occurs also in reniform stalactitic masses at Matlock in Derbyshire ; in granite, with quartz and fluor, at Pol dice, in Cornwall ; in cavities of chalcedony and calc spar, in Russia, and other places. Naphtha issues from the earth in large quantities in Persia and the Birman empire ; at Rangoon there are upwards of five hundred naphtha wells, which afford annually 412,000 hhds. A remarkable lake of bitumen occurs on Trinidad, which is one and a half mdes in circumference. The bitumen is solid and cold near the shores, but gradually increases in temperature and softness towards the centre, where it is boiling. The solidified bitu men appears as if it had cooled as the surface boiled up in large bubbles. The ascent to the lake from the sea, a distance of three-quarters of a mile, is covered with the hard ened pitch, on which trees and vegetation flourish, and about Point La Braye the masses of pitch look like black rocks among the foliage. In the peninsula of Apcheron, on the western shore of the Caspian, naphtha rises in vapor through a marly sod, and is collected by sinking pits several yards in depth, into which the naphtha flows. Near Amians in the state of Parma, is an abundant spring. Near Alfreton, England, naphtha has been discovered. Petroleum is met with at Kenhawa in Virginia, Scotsville, Ky., Oil Creek in Venango Co., Penn., Duck Creek in Monroe Co., Ohio, and Liverpool, Ohio. It was formerly col lected and sold by the Seneca and other Indians, and is hence called Seneca ox Genesee oil. Naphtha affords both fuel and lights to the inhabitants of Badku, on the Caspian. It is also employed in Persia and the Birman empire as a lotion in cutaneous eruptions, and as an embrocation in bruises and rheumatic affections. It is employed for various purposes in the arts, particularly in the manufacture of varnish, and as a substitute for oil in the formation of oil paint, it being preferred on account of its rapid evaporation and drying. Bitumen, in all its varieties, was well known to the ancients. It is reported to have been employed iu the construction of the walls of Babylon, and at Agrigentum it was burnt in lamps, and called Sicilian oil. The Egyptians also made use of it in embalm ing. Two ship loads of the Trinidad pitch were sent to England by Admiral Cochrane, but it was found that the oil required to render it fit for use, exceeded in expense the cost of pitch in England, and the project of employing it was therefore abandoned. Asphaltum is a constituent of the kind of varnish called Japan ; it is also made into a cement for lining cisterns, and with ground stone into a material for pavements. IDRIALINE.

Expands one-fourth its size by an increment of 30\u00b0 F., or is nearly 32 times more expansible than water, by an increment of 30\u00b0 of heat at the temperature of 50\u00b0. Occurs in minute cavities in crystals of topaz, chrysoberyl, quartz crystals from Quebec, and amethyst from Siberia, where it was detected by Sir David Brewster. We have thought proper to recognize this fluid among minerals and name it, although yet imperfectly described. The fluid expands with the heat of the hand. Its refractive power is less than that of water. It was sometimes indurated in the cavity like a resin. On exposure, the fluid undergoes quick motions and changes, and finally leaves a residue of minute particles, which from the moisture of the hand alone, sud denly became fluid again, and extended and contracted as before. This was indefinitely repeated. The residue is volatilized by heat, and dissolves in the acids without efferves cence.

A perfect Chemical Classification of minerals is strictly and completely, in every feature, a Natural System. We learn from a general study of inorganic nature, that very many of those dis tinctions which the eye seizes upon at first as essential and funda mental, are of little value as a basis of a scientific arrangement ; that, for true distinctions, we must look beneath the surface to those characters which are indicative of the fundamental forces or qual ities upon which the existence of the species depends. Hardness, lustre, density, were the characters earliest appealed to in the group ing of minerals, and they have been accepted in some modern sys tems, as the proper basis of a natural arrangement ; yet nothing can be more untrue to nature. Even metallic lustre, which has separated the so-called \" blendes\" from the \" glances\" and/' pyrites,\" is an unimportant characteristic, since species that are related in all essential qualities, may be widely unlike as regards the reflec tion of light \u2014 the property on which lustre depends. But in educing a chemical arrangement, a disregard of all phy sical characters leads as widely from the true line, as a neglect of chemistry. The first step with regard to the great principle of isomorphous substitutions was taken through crystallographic com parisons in connection with chemical analysis ; and crystallogra phy sustains an equally high ground in many questions bearing on the classification of inorganic substances, \u2014 the crystalline structure being a true exhibition, in one mode, of the fundamental molecular character of a substance. If we undertake to arrange compounds under the prominent element in their constitution, without refer ence to isomorphism, whether it be the so-called electro-negative element, or the electro-positive, (adopting or not the order of rela tive negativity or positivity of the elements), and follow this rule undeviatingly, we necessarily produce unnatural groupings of spe cies. Or if we are guided by the oxygen proportions of the con stituents, the arrangement is no less artificial. The minerals of the scapolite group, and even the varieties of the species scapolite,"], [581, "CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION. 565 have in these ways been widely separated in some chemical ar rangements, notwithstanding the fact taught by crystallization, that on some ground, and this of the most essential importance, these varieties are intimately related. The feldspar family has in hke manner been hardly recognized in most chemical classifications, notwithstanding the close relation of the species. The errors of most chemical systems hitherto proposed, have arisen partly from regarding almost solely the particular elements present, rather than the relations of the different elements ; and partly Irom the mistaken idea that minerals constitute a complete King dom in nature by themselves, instead of being excerpts from the great Inorganic Kingdom \u2014 and forgetting therefore that they are to be classified not by themselves alone, but as they happen to fall in the wider system of Inorganic Nature. In judging such mis takes we should remember that a complete system of classification, exhibiting correctly all the affinities of species, with due reference to their comparative importance, is the very last result of a per fected science. With the rapid progress of chemistry through past years, nothing else than what appears in the history of mineral ogv was to be expected. Neither can we now hope to propose an arrangement that shall fare better than its predecessors : for some of those points that lie at the foundation of classification are in discussion and doubt, and other questions of no less importance are probably yet to arise. The extension of knowledge relating to the isomorphous relations of ele ments \u2014 that is, in effect, their relative atomic forces \u2014 is preparing the way for a better understanding of the affinities of inorganic compounds. In the system here brought forward, there is a refer ence throughout to the distinctions and affiliations thus exhibited. The arrangement presents at a glance the coincidences among dif ferent compounds which have been brought to light by the labors of different chemists, among we mention especially Kopp, Frank enheim, Otto, the Professors Rose and Rammelsberg. In many cases, we have as yet no safe guide in our groupings. We cannot say how far hydrous and anhydrous species should be kept separate. Scheerer's principle, if true, breaks down the seeming importance of this distinction. Yet as this principle, and others that lead the same way, are not established, we have chosen to draw a line between them.* * There is a special difficulty here, arising from the tendency of some anhydrous species to become hydrated by the absorption of water. Thus iolite may receive wa ter, so that new compounds are formed. These new compounds have been taken as ori ginal species, and the relations of the water to the other constituents estimated accord ing to a proposed theory, when in fact the original bases still remain unaltered in their relation to the silica, and the only change is the absorption of water in one, two, or more atoms. The new mineral is a pseudomorph. In some micas, water appears to enter in the same way, the original proportions of the constituents being unchanged. The mica as crystallized was probably anhydrous, though now hydrous, (and perhaps brittle as a con sequence) ; and any speculations therefore, or assumptions made without taking this point"], [582, "566 CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION. Again, certain compounds seem to authorize us in assuming that alumina and silica may replace one another ; while, at the same time, some of the most distinguished chemists of the day urge the claims of a system in which alumina and all related peroxyds re place the protoxyds according to a certain ratio. While such im portant points remain in discussion, it is evident that we are still far from knowing the whole truth, and the following classification must partake of the ignorance. In deciding to separate the salts of protoxyds and peroxyds, where distinct, we have chosen one of two doubtful courses. At times, when without isomorphism to aid, we have sought to place species together which appeared to be closest in chemical and physical relations, these two points being considered together. But in numerous instances much remains to be done before the general plan proposed can be carried out. The hydrous silicates are among those that are with difficulty arranged in groups. The basis of the classification is presented in the arrangement of the elements, on page 152, which we here repeat, (inverting it how ever), that the key to the system may be at hand for comparison. 1. a.

The above is not intended as a lineal order into view, must be erroneous. There are many species that admit of a simdar change aud it is a question to be settled by proof, and not assertion, whether the water is ori ginal with the species and at the basis of its form and structure, or whether of subse quent introduction. The facts with regard to iolite are dlustrations of a general prin ciple of wide importance, and they show that the mere presence of water, even a large percentage, is no proof that it belonged to the original compound, even though that hy drous character may pervade the same mineral over considerable areas. A hydrous feldspar, or mica, therefore, is not to be received as a hydrous species oriqinally with out evidence sufficient to remove doubt, obtained by special investigation. Such hy drous minerals are promising to become numerous, and unless their titles are fully tested, they will soon prove to be a burden to the science. Mineralogy has already re ceived mne or ten species, thus made out of iohte, (see pages 293 294\u2014 and iberite page 295, should probably be added) ; but in this case, happily, the derivative character has been detected."], [583, "CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION. 567 ot affinities, for such is not nature. Group 2 affiliates more strong ly with 4, through titanium and silicium, than with 3 through molybdenum and vanadium; while group 3 appears to affiliate with group 5, through arsenic and sulphur.

The system of crystallization is pointed out in each case by Roman numerals, as follows : I. Monometric System. IV. Monoclinic System. II. Dimetric System. V. Triclinic System. III. Trimetric System. VI. Hexagonal System. The various cases of dimorphism and trimorphism among the species are also apparent, from the nature of the arrangement, as will be observed without explanation.! As an example, we men tion, \u2014 the Galena Group, Copper Glance Group, and Greenockite Group, on page 569, constitute an instance of trimorphism, the first having a monometric, the second a trimetric, and the third a hex agonal form. After the name of each species we have given the page on which it is described in the foregoing part of this Treatise. * The oxyds have close relations to the sulphurets. But the affinity of the sulphurets to the arseniurets among minerals is so great and of such interest, that we have placed the oxyds in a separate division. In an arrangement on paper, which is necessarily linear, and therefore not altogether natural, many of the affinities must be left redis played, or be exhibited by drawing out the groups into parallel series. + When the connection of a species with the group to which it is attached is doubtful, owino- to the crystalline form of the species being unknown, the name is preceded by a bracket The bracket is used in the same manner on page 468."], [584, "568 CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION.

In the following Tables for the Determination of Minerals, the student is supposed to have the requisite means for determining the blowpipe and ordinary chemical characters of minerals, so far at least as to be able to test \u2014 * 1 . The effervescence or non-effervescence with the three mineral acids. 2. The solubility, more or less perfect, in these acids, cold or hot, or the insolubility of a mineral in the same reagents. 3. The presence of water by subjecting the mineral in a matrass or tube closed below, to the blowpipe heat. 4. The character of the water or fumes given off with the acids or heat, whether containing fluoric or other acids, or alkaline. 5. The blowpipe reactions for sulphur, phosphorus, boracic acid, and other cases of this kind. 6. The presence of arsenic, and each of the volatile metals; also of copper, lead, &c. The student is advised to study well the use of the blowpipe, and the various effects of the fluxes ; and for this purpose Whitney's translation of Berzelius on the Blowpipe, (published at Boston), will be found his best guide. Two tables are here given, one in which the general divisions are based on lustre, streak, and blowpipe and chemical characters ; and another, in which the species are arranged under the several sys tems of crystallization. The following are the subdivisions adopted in Table I. * It is obvious that for correct results, the testing should be carefully performed. It is not sufficient in trying for carbonic acid, to put a drop of ddute acid on the specimen ; for carbonate of lime may be present as an impurity, and give rise to effervescence: a fragment should be tested in a test tube and its complete solution and effervescence to the end ascertained. To ascertain whether a mineral yields a malleable globule before the blowpipe with the fluxes, soda should be tried, if not successful with borax."], [603, "DETERMINATIVE MINERALOGY. 587 1 a TABLE I.

I. CATALOGUE OF AMERICAN LOCALITIES OF MINERALS. The following catalogue may aid the mineralogical tourist in selecting his routes and arranging the plan of his journey. Only important localities, affording cabinet specimens, are in general included. The list is an abstract of the fuller information with regard to locahties, scattered through the Descriptive part of this Treatise. The recent appearance of the various Reports by the several State Geologists, have enabled the author to give a completeness to this branch of American Mineralogy, before unattainable. For the facts included, the country is especially indebted to the Reports of Prof. Shepard of the Connecticut survey, Profs. Beck, Emmons, and Mather, Messrs. Vanuxem and Hall of the New York, Prof. Hitchcock of the Massachusetts, Dr. Jackson of the Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island surveys, Prof. H D. Rogers of the New Jersey, Prof. W. B. Rogers of the Virginia survey, Prof. Troost and Houghton, and Mr Owen of the Western States, Prof. C. B. Adams of the Vermont survey, and Prof. M Tuomey of the South Carolina : some distinguished names among the State Geologists are here omitted, as their regions were not mineral regions. The American Journal of Sci- ence and Arts, and the Transactions of the various scientific societies of the country, have also contributed essentially to this part of the work : and among the names in these Journals conspicuous in this department, in addition to the above enumerated, I would especially mention Messrs. A. Bruce, P. Cleaveland, B. Silliman, W. Meade, G. Gibbs, C Dewey, J. F. Dana, F. Hall, T. Nuttall, H. H. Hayden, J. G. Percival, G. T. Bowen, D Olmsted, H. Seybert, C. U. Shepard, S. Fowler, T. G.

Johnston, G. W. Benedict, J. Gebhard, J. D. Whitney, and W. B Hough. The author \u2022would also acknowledge here his indebtedness for many private communications in this department especially from Prof. B. Sdliman, Jr., Messrs. J. E. Teschemacher, and C. T Jackson Boston ; Thomas F. Seal and Wm. S. Vaux, Philadelphia, L. White Wil- liams of Westchester, Pa. ; Hon. T. L. Clingman, of North Carolina, and D. Dale Owen and J G Norwood, of Indiana. The Pennsylvania list is largely prepared from recent information furnished the author, mostly by Messrs. Williams and Seal -, the Minesota and Wisconsin through contributions by Messrs Owen and Norwood ; the North Caro lina from a manuscript catalogue received from the Hon. Mr. Clingman, and the Michi- gan, from the explorations of Dr. C. T. Jackson. \u25a0 In making out the catalogue, the names of those minerals which are obtained in good specimens at the several localities, are distinguished by italics. When the specimens are remarkably good, an exclamation mark (!) has been added, or two of these marks s\u00bb!l when the specimens are quite unique. The more exact position of localities may in most instances be ascertained by reference to the description of the species in the pre ceding part of the Treatise."], [660, "644 SUPPLEMENT. MAINE.

II. ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS.* 1. The first principle to be kept in mind in drawing a figure of a crystal, is this : edges which are parallel in the crystal sliould be represented in the figure as parallel. Figures projected with this principle in view, though without mathematical accuracy, will be valuable to the science. Yet a knowledge of mathematical crystallography, greatly facilitates the application of this principle. In the projection of crystals, the eye is supposed to be at an infinite distance, so that the rays of light fall from it on the crystal in parallel lines ; and not di verging as in ordinary landscape perspective. If parallel lines were drawn from the vertices of the solid angles of a crystal, to a board placed behind it, and the points thus formed on the board were connected by straight lines, as in the crystal, a representation of the crystal would be formed, constructed according to the mode of projection em ployed in crystallography. The plane on which the crystal is projected, is termed the plane of projection. This plane may be at right angles with the vertical axis, may pass through the vertical axis, or may intersect it at an obliejue angle. These different posi tions give rise, respectively, to the horizontal, vertical, and oblique projections. The rays of light may fall perpendicularly on the plane of projection, or may be obliquely inclined to it ; in the former case the projection is termed orthographic, in the second clinographic. In the horizontal position of the plane of projection, the projection is always orthographic. In the other positions, it may be either orthographic or clino graphic. It has been usual to give the plane of projection an obhque position, and to use the orthographic mode of projection. It is howeverpreferable to employ the verti cal position and clinographic projection, and this methocr is elucidated in the following pages, PROJECTION OF THE PRIMARY FORMS. 2. The projection of the axes of a crystal, is the first step preliminary to the projec tion of the crystal itself. It will be more convenient to illustrate first the projection of the axes in the monometric primaries, which are equal and intersect at right angles. The projection of the axes in the other classes, may be obtained by varying the lengths of the projected monometric axes, and also, when oblique, their inclinations. 1. Monometric System. \u2014 When the eye is directly in front of a face of a cube, neither the 6ides nor top of the crystal are visible, nor the secondary planes that may be situated on the intermediate edges. On turning the crystal a few degrees from right to * The following pages are condensed from the \" Lehrbuch der reinen und angewandten Krystallographie,\" of Dr. Carl Freiderich Naumann.

Half the planes on the crystal are now visible, and consequently this is a Fig- 1- convenient position for projecting it. In the foUowing demonstration the angle ot revolution is designated ., and the angle of the elevation of the eye, _. Fig. 1 represents the normal position of the horizontal axes, supposing the eye to be in the direction of the axis BB ; BB is seen as a mere point, while CC appears of its actual length. On revolving the whole through a number of degrees equal to BMB' (<5) the axes have the position exhibited in the dotted lines. The pro jection of the semiaxis MB is now lengthened to MN, and that of the semiaxis MC is shortened to MH. If the eye be elevated, (at any angle, _), the lines B'N, BM and C H will be projected respectively be- low N, M and H, and the lengths of these projections (which we may designate b'N, bM and c'H) will be directly proportional to the lengths of the Unes B'N, BM and C'H It is usual to adopt such a revolution and such a elevation of the eye as may be ex pressed by a simple ratio between the projected axes. Let us designate the ratio be tween the two axes as projected after the revolution aUuded to (MN : MH) by 1 : r ; and the ratio of b'N to MN by 1 : s. Now the character of the view wiU vary with the values assumed for r and _. Suppose r to equal 3 and s to equal 2, then proceed aa follows : Draw two lines AA', H'H (fig. 2) intersecting one another at right angles. Make MH\u2014 MH' =b. Divide HH' into r parts, and through the points, N, N', thus determined, draw perpendicu lars to HH'. On the left hand vertical, set off, below H', a part H'R, equal to - b= -H'M ; and Fig. 2. from R draw RM, and extend the same to the vertical N'. B'B is the projection of the front horizontal axis. 2. Draw BS parallel with MH', and connect S, M From the point T in which SM intersects BN, draw TC parallel with MH. A line (CC) drawn from C through M, and extended to the left vertical, is the projection of the side horizon tal axis. 3. Lay off on the right vertical, a part HQ equal to - MH, and make MA=MA'=MQ ; AA' is the vertical axis. The values of r and s, commonly ta ken are r=3, \u00ab=2, in which case, i\u2014 18\u00b0 26' and e =9\u00b0 28'. It is not unu sual to give s the value 3, in which case \u00a3=6\u00b0 20'. This affords a narrow er terminal plane. The angle S is ob tained by the equation cot <!=)\u2022, and the angle e by the equation cot e=r s. 4. The regular octahedron may now be drawn, by connecting the extremi ties of the horizontal axes, and then uni ting them by right lines with the points A A' as in fig. 3. If lines be drawn through the points B and B', parallel withC C, and through C, C, parallel with the axis BB', a plane figure abed is formed, which is a horizontal sec- Fig. 3. tion of the cube. Through the points ..... , , f. t . , abed, draw lines parallel with the vertical axis AA', and extend them each side"], [680, "664 SUPPLEMENT. of these points, to a distance equal to the vertical semiaxis MA. By connecting the upper and also the lower extremities of these perpendiculars by hues parallel with the lines ab, be, cd, da, the figure will represent a cube. The cube may also be projected by drawing lines from M to the centre of each edge of the octahedron, and then extending these lines to double their length. Their extremi ties are the vertices of the angles of the cube ; and by connecting them a representa tion of the cube is formed. 5. Dimetric System. \u2014 In the dimetric system of crystallization, the vertical axis is of varying dimensions, while the horizontal axes are equal, as in the monometric system. The vertical axis may be made to correspond to the dimensions in a dimetric crystal, by a laying off on MA and MA', (taken as units), extended if necessary, a line equal to r ; or if b, the horizontal axis of the prism, =1, the line should equal a (the vertical axis) simply. After determining thus the points A\", A'\", the dimetric octahedron may be formed in the same manner as the regular octahedron above described, except that the points A\", A'\" should be substituted for A, A'. The method of describing the cube, al ready explained, may be employed also for the right square prism. Another right square prism may be represented by drawing fines parallel with the vertical axis, through the extremities of the horizontal axes, making them equal to the vertical axis, and uniting their extremities. Also another square octahedron may be constructed by connecting the points a, b, c, d, with the extremities of the vertical axis. 6. Trimetric System. \u2014 The monometric axes may be adapted to trimetric forms as follows : if the axis 6\u20141, lay off MA\" and MA'\" equal to a, and MC\", MC\" equal to c : if c=\\, make MB\", MB'\", equal to 6. By connecting the extremities of the axes, as already explained, the rhombic octahedron may be constructed. The rectangular prism may be projected in the same manner as the cube ; the rhombic prism in the same man ner as the second square prism just described ; and the rectangular octahedron, in the same manner as the second dimetric octahedron explained in the last section. 7. Monoclinic System. \u2014 The axes a and b in the monoclinic system an- inclined to one another at an oblique angle=y. To project this inclination, and thus adapt the monometric axes to a monoclinic form, lay off on the axis MA, Ma= MA cos y, and on the axis BB' (before or behind M, according as the inclination of b on a, in front, is acute or obtuse) M6=MBXsin y. From the points b and a, draw lines parallel respectively with the axes AA' and BB', and from their inter section D', draw through M, D'D, making MD= MD'. The line DD' is the clinodiagonal and the lines AA, CC, DD' represent the axes in a monoclinic solid in which a=b=c=l. The points a and b and the position of the axis DD' will vary with the angle y. The relative values of the axes may be given them as above explained ; that is, if 0=1, lay off in the direction of MA and MA' a line equal to a, and in the direction of MC and MC a line equal to c, <fec. Fig. 4. The right rhomboidal prism may be projected in the same manner as the cube or rieht rectangular prism, and the obhque rhombic prism, in the same manner as the rhrht rhombic prism. 6 8. Diclinic System.*\u2014 In the diclinic system, the vertical sections through the hori zontal axes intersect one another at right angles, as in the preceding system but the in chnation of a to 6 (y) and a to c (0) axe each oblique. This obliquity mav be e-iven the monometric axes as follows: Lay off on MA, (figure 4), Ma=MAXcos v and on the axis BB' (brachydiagonal), M6=MB'Xsin y. By completing the parallelolrram M\u201e D'6, the point D' is determined Make MD=V ;W ss tl/projecTed^ brachyTago nal. Again lay off on MA, Ma'=MA Xcos 0, and on MC, to the left Mc=MC'y sin/J Draw lines from a' and c parallel to MC and MA ; E', the intersection of these lines\" is one extremity of the macrodiagonal ; and the line E'E, in which ME=ME' is the * The Diclinic system differs from the TrichnkhTwTng only t^f the axial inter- lections oblique instead of the three As no example of It has been observed a^ong minerals, and the forms are as well described ,n the triclinic system, it was not mention ed in the earlier part of this work."], [681, "665 ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. macrodiagonal. AA', DD', EE' are the axes in a diclinate form, in which the axes are equal. From the observations on the preceding systems of crystallization, the method to be employed in giving the axes their relative values in a particular diclinate form, is sufficiently obvious. The construction of the oblique rectangular prism is analogous to that of the cube. 9. Triclinic System. \u2014 The vertical sections through the horizontal axes, in the triclinic system, are obliquely inclined ; also the inclination of the axis a to each axis b and c, is oblique. In the adaptation of the monometric axes to the triclinic forms, it is therefore necessary, in the first place, to give the requisite obliquity to the mutual inclination of the vertical sections, and afterwards, to adapt the horizontal axes, as in the diclinate system. The inclination of these sections we may designate A, and as heretofore, the angle between a and b, y, and a and c, 0. BB' is the analogue of the brachydiagonal, and CC of the macrodiagonal. An oblique inclination may be given the vertical sec tions, by varying the position of either of these sections. Permitting the brachydiagonal section ABA'B' to remain unaltered, we may vary the other section as follows ; Lay off MB, M6'=MBxcos A, and on the axis CC, (to the right or left of M, according as the acute angle A is to the right or left), Mc=MCX sin A ; completing the parallelogram M6' Dc, and drawing the diagonal MD, extending the same to D' so as to make MD'=MD, we obtain the line DD'; the vertical section passing through this fine is the correct macrodiagonal section. The in clination of a to the new macrodiagonal DD', is still a right angle ; as also the inclination of a to 6, their oblique inclinations may be given them by means of the same formulas employed in the di clinate system, except that the axis D'D is to be substituted for CC. The vertical axis AA' and the horizontal axes EE' (brachydiagonal) and FF' (macrodiagonal) thus obtained, are the axes in a triclinate form in which a=6=c=l. Different Fig. 5. values may be given these axes, according to the method heretofore illustrated. 10. Hexagonal System. \u2014 In this system there are three equal horizontal axes, at right angles with the vertical The normal position of the horizontal axes is represented in fig. 6. The eye, placed in the hne of the axis YY, observes two of the semiaxes, MZ and MU, projected in the same straight line, whde the third, MY, ap pears a mere point. To give the axes a more eli gible position for a representation of the various planes on a tetraxonal solid, we revolve them from right to left through a certain number of degrees, 6. and elevate the eye at an angle e. The dotted lines in the figure represent the axes in their new situation, resulting from a revolution through a number of degrees equal to ci=YMY'. In this position the axis MY' is projected upon MP, MU' upon MN, and MZ' on MH. Designating the in termediate axis I, that to the right II, that to the Fig. 6. left III, if the revolution is such as to give the projections of I and II, the ratio of 1 : 2, the relations of the three projections will be aa follows : I : II : 111=1 : 2 : 3. 11. Let us take r (PM : HM) equal to 3, and s (b'P : PM) equal to 2, these being the most convenient ratios for representing the hexagonal crystalline forms. The following wdl be the mode of construction. 1. Draw the lines AA, HH at right angles with, and bisecting each other. Let HM =6, or HH=2&. Divide HH into six parts by vertical lines. These lines including the left and right hand verticals may be numbered from one to six, as in the figure. In the first vertical, below H, lay off HS= - b, and from S draw a line through M to the fourth vertical YY' is the projection of the axis I. 84"], [682, "666 SUPPLEMENT. Fig. 7. A 2. From Y draw a line to the sixth vertical and parallel with HH. From T, the extremity of this line, draw a line to N in the second vertical. Then from the point U in which TN intersects the fifth vertical, draw a line through M to the second vertical; UU' is the projection of the axis II. 3. From R, where TN intersects the third vertical draw RZ to the first vertical paraUel with HH. Then from Z draw a line through M to the sixth vertical : this line ZZ' is the pro jection of the axis III. 4. For the vertical axis, lay off from N on the second vertical (fig. 7) a liue of any length and construct upon this line an equi- lateral triangle ; one side NQ of this triangle , . will intersect the first vertical at a distance, HV, from H, .corresponding to Z H m fig 6 for in the triangle NHV, the angle HNV is an angle of 30\u00b0, and HN=f MH. . M V is therefore the radius of the circle, (fig. 6). Make therefore MA=MA'=MV ; AA is the vertical axis, and YY', UU', ZZ' are the projected horizontal axes. 12. The vertical axis has been constructed equal to the horizontal axes, its actual length indifferent hexagonal or rhombohedral forms maybe laid off according to the method sufficiently explained. If lines be drawn through the extremities of the hori zontal axes, paraUel with the vertical axis, and the parts above and below be made equal to the vertical semiaxis, their extremities will be the vertices of the angles of a hfxaqonal prism, and by connecting them we obtain the projection of this solid. A double hexagonal pyramid, the isosceles dodecahedron, may be projected by connect ng the extremities of the horizontal axes with each other, and also uniting them with the extremities of the vertical axis. By drawing lines through the extremities of each hori zontal axis, parallel to a line connecting the ex- Fig. 8. tremities of the other two axes, a plane hexagonal figure will be obtained, which is the section of a hexagonal prism diagonal with the one above referred to ; and by connecting the angles of this hexagonal plane with extremities of the vertical axis, a second isosceles dodecahedron is projected. 13. To construct a rhombohedron, lay off verti cals through the extremities of the horizontal axes, and make the parts, both above and below these extremities, equal to the third of the vertical semiaxis, (fig. 8). The points E, E, E', E', cfcc, are thus determined ; and if the extremities of the ver tical axis be connected with the points E or E', rhombohedrons in different positions, tnS. or \u2014 rniX, will be constructed. Delineation of Secondary Planes on the Primary Forms 14. Previous to drawing the secondary planes on a primary, it becomes necessary to determine the direction of the intersections of these planes with the primary faces, and also in most cases, with other secondary planes. The principles of analytical geometry have afforded Naumann formulas for these intersections ; but it would be giving this arti cle too great an extension to enter into a full discussion of this method of determining intersections. It is in general sufficient to employ the method of construction. In the employment of the plan of construction, the projection of the prism OP, ooPoo is the most convenient preliminary Btep ; that is, the cube in the monometric system, right square prism in the dimetric system, the rectangular prism in the trimetric, the right rhomboidal in the monoclinic, and the prism OP, oo P oo, oo P o>, in the diclinic and tri clinic systems. This is advisable because in these forms the lateral edges are equal and"], [683, "ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. 667 parallel to the vertical axis, and the basal edges, to the horizontal axes ; and consequently in laying off the different planes, these edges may be substituted for the axes. _ 15. Suppose, for example, the right rectangular prism has been projected, (fig 9), and it is required to place on its angles the plane 2P, whose parametric ratio is 2 : 1 : 1. Since 2 refers to the vertical axis, we lav off on the lateral edge (e) twice as many parts of this edge as of each of the terminal edges, (e and e). Consequently, by taking a point in the edge e distant from a, J the length of <\u2022, and a point in each e and e, i their respec tive lengths, and then joining these points, the conditions will be complied with, and the plane 2P will be constructed. If the plane to be introduced were 4P2 the parametric ratio of which is 4 : 2 : 1, (in which 4 refers to the vertical axis and 2 to the longer hori zontal), we should in the same manner mark off 4 parts of e, 2 of e, and 1 of e ; if the plane were 4P2, (in which 2 refers to the shorter horizontal axis, 2 parts of e should be laid off, and 1 of e. By connecting the points thus determined, the plane 4P2 or 4P2 would be delineated. If the plane were 2Poo (2 : oo : 1), which represents a plane on the longer terminal edge, 2 parts of e should be laid off, and 1 of e ; from the deter mined points in e and e, hues should be drawn to the opposite edges parallel with the edge e, and by connecting the extremities of the lines thus drawn, the desired representation of a plane 2Poo would be completed. The same should be repeated on all the similar edges. This will suffice to illustrate the manner of substituting the edges for the axes, and also the method of delineating single planes. 16. The manner of determining the intersections of planes, we may illustrate by an example. Suppose it were required to place the planes P, 2P, 4P2, and 2P2 on a right rectangular prism. Two rectangular prisms should first be accurately projected by the method which has been explained. One, of a size which may be considered convenient for a representation of the crystal, drawn with light pencil marks ; the other of larger dimensions, for the purpose of determining the direction of the intersections ; these inter sections, when determined are to be transferred to the smaller figure. On fig. 9 we may first lay down the plane P, by drawing lines connecting the centres of the three edges about the angle. These lines are necessarily parallel to the diagonals of the three faces ; the triangle mno is therefore the plane P. By connecting the points m, b, n, the plane 2P is constructed ; for the plane mbn cuts off 2 parts of e to 1 of each e aud e, as the expression 2P requires. To lay off 4P2 (4:1: 2), let the whole edge ab represent 4; then an (i of e) will equal 2 parts on the edge e, and ap (} of e) wdl equal 1 part on e, agreeably to the expression 4P2 ; npb is therefore the plane 4 P2. The perimeters of Fig. 9. Fig. 10. the planes npb (4P2) and nmo (P) intersect one another in the points n and a ; conse quently the line of intersection between these two planes must be situated between these points, and therefore the direction of the intersection of P and 4?2 is na. The planes nmb (2P) and npb (4P2) intersect in the line nb, and therefore the inter section of 2P and 4P2 is in the direction of nb. Again, the intersection of P and 2P has the direction mn."], [684, "668 SUPPLEMENT. We may next lay off the plane 2P2, (2:2: 1), which may be constructed by marking off 2 parts on each e and e and 1 part on e. Such a plane is mro, since ao=Z\\e, am=-je, and ar\u2014\\e. Therefore the intersection of mro (2P2) with mno (P) has the direction of the common line mo. The perimeters of the planes mro (2P2) and npb (4P2) intersect in the points a and 0. If therefore these planes formed an edge of intersection it would have the direction of the line a0 or ro. The line ro ofthe plane mro (2P2) is parallel to nb ofthe plane mnb (2P) ; the inter sections of 2 P2 and 2P would therefore be parallel with these lines. In this manner all the mutual intersections of these and other planes may be obtained. Fig. 10 exhibits these planes in their respective positions, as above determined. The planes may be lettered as in the figure; mno\u2014 a, rre\u00ab6=a', mro=o, npb\u2014o'. The edges a : P and a : a' were made parallel with mn, (fig. 9). The intersection of P with 6 has the direction mr, that of P with 6', the direction of np. The intersections of a, 6, M are parallel with mo ; those of a', 6, M, have the direction bn, as determined above. The edge a : o' is drawn in the direction na, explained above as the intersection of npb and \u00bb\u00abio. Finally, the edge M : a' is drawn parallel with mb, and the edge M : 6, paral lel with pb, which in fig. 9 is obviously the intersection of pbn with M. The planes 6 and 6' do not meet ; were the plane a' wanting, their intersection would have been drawn parallel with a0 ox parallel with the edge a' : 6'. 17. In this manner a sketch of a crystal may be made or rectified, or a figure maybe drawn, whose prototype has not been observed. The crystallographic expressions, how ever, do not indicate the size of the planes. The edge M : o' might have been so drawn as not to have formed an intersection with the plane P. Again, these secondary planes might have been so extended, that in connection with the corresponding planes on the other angles, they should obliterate mostly or entirely the primary faces. The intersec tions of the planes would not however be changed in direction. There would be new intersections of planes on opposite parts of the same primary face, which it would be necessary to determine in the above manner. 18. We may now add the planes JPoo , 2Poo , Poo , and oo P ; the two former are re- placements of the longer terminal edge e, the third is situated on the shorter edge e, and the last is a replacement of a lateral edge. We may also suppose that $\u25a0 Poo meets the planes a and o ; 2Poo , the plane 6 ; P oo, the planes a' and 6', and oo P, the planes a' and 6'. It is therefore necessary to determine the direction of these intersections. For this pur pose fig. 9 is redrawn (tig. 11) to avoid con fusion from the multiplicity of similar lines, (this would not be required in practice), and the lines in the preceding figure, not including the new planes, are here dotted. The plane ntuv is so drawn that an equals ie and a*\u2014 I of ie, which fulfiUs the condi tions for the plane f Poo (\u00a3 : oo : 1). Again, srow is the plane 2Poo (2 : oo : 1) ; for it cuts off j of e and J of e, or 2 parts of e to 1 of e. Fig. 11. The perimeters of the jilanes vntu (fPoo ) and mno (P) intersect in the points n and a ; the intersections of f Poo with P has therefore the direction art, and is parallel with the edge a : 6' in figure 10. The perimeters of the planes vntu (fPoo ) and mro (2P2), intersect in the points a and y ; and a line from a to y marks the direction of the edge between the planes fPoo and 2P2. The perimeters of the planes srow (2Poo and mro (2P2), coincide in the line ro. The intersection of 2P\u0153 and 2P2 has therefore the direction ro, and is parallel with the ed\"e 6 : a' in fig. 10. \u00b0"], [685, "ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. 669 Again, the plane gmol represents Poo (1:1: oo), for it cuts off equal parts of the edges e and e. The perimeters of the planes gmol and nmo (P) coincide in the line mo ; their intersection is therefore parallel to this fine, or to the edges a : 6 and 6 : M, fig. 10. The perimeters gmol and npb (4P2) intersect in the points o and \u00a3 ; a line from a to { therefore marks the direction of the edge between Poo and 4P2 (6'). Again, the plane prkh is the projection oo P (oo : 1 : 1), for it cuts off equal portions of e and e, and is parallel with the lateral edge. The perimeters prkh (oo P) and mbn (2P) intersect in the points e and ( ; a line between these points is parallel with mn. The intersection of these planes wdl therefore be parallel with mn, or the edge a : a', (fig. 10). The perimeters prkh (oo P), and pnb (4P2) intersect in the points p and {. A line drawn from p to \u00a3 determines therefore the intersection of oo P and 4P2 (6'). Fig. J2. Fig. 13. Fig. 12 contains these additional planes laid down according to the above deductions. The edge a : e' (f Poo ) is parallel with the edge a : o' ; the edge e' : 6 has the dhection ay ; the edge e\" (2Poo ) : 6 is parallel with the edge 6 : a' ; the edge a : e (Pco ) is paral lel with edge a : o or M : 6 ; the edge 6' : i has the direction of a line from a to ( ; the edge a' : e (oo P) is parallel with the edge P : a ; and finally the edge e : 6' has the di rection of a fine drawn from to p to f. In this manner the intersections of all possible planes may be determined and trans ferred. It should be observed that similar parts of a crystal are simdarly modified. Figure 1 2 is a completed representation of a crystal which presents the planes above designated, viz. : OP . oo Poo . oo Poo . P . 2P . 2P2 . 4P2 . Poo . \u00a3P=o . 2Poo . oo P P M M a a' o 6' e 6' e\" \u00ab This same descriptive expression applies equally to fig. 13, which contains the same planes as fig. 12, but differently proportioned in size. The planes M have been dimin ished by the enlargement of e, thus producing a modified rhombic prism. The directions of the intersections are identical with those in fig. 12. This figure illustrates a preceding remark, (\u00a7 16), that the descriptive expression of planes indicate merely their situation, and not their size. According to the same method, crystals may be projected in each of the crystallo graphic classes, after their axes have been accurately laid down. It was remarked that the figure employed for determining the intersections should be large : in a large figure slight variations from the true direction or position of hues produce errors of less mag nitude. Also the fines should be carefully and delicately drawn. With the point of a needle on glazed cards, a very great degree of accuracy may be attained. PROJECTION OF SIMPLE SECONDARY FORMS. 19. Monometric System. \u2014 The projection of many of the simple secondary forms, \u2014 for example, the trisoctahedrons, the hexoctahedrons, &c. \u2014 by the method of construction which has been explained, would be a long and tedious process ; at least when compared with the more simple method, depending on the relative lengths of the axes and the rhombic and trigonal interaxes in these forma. The right fines passing through the"], [686, "670 SUPPLEMENT. centre of the octahedron to the centres of its edges, are called rhombic mterax.es; and those which pass to the centres of the faces, are the trigonal interaxes. In tiie several monometric forms, the extremities of one or more of these interaxes extended or di minished in their lengths, occupy the vertices of the solid angles. If therefore these points (the extremities of the interaxes) can be determined m the several crystalline forms it will only remain to connect them, in order to form a projection of these solids. The principles of analytical geometry afford the means of determining how much the interaxes of the regular octahedron must be increased or diminished to equal the inter axes in these different forms. It is thus found that each half of a trigonal interaxis for any form mPn must be increased by that portion expressed in the fraction 2 mn \u2014 (m+n). mn-\\-(m-\\-n) and for each half of a rhombic interaxis, we have the corresponding fraction n\u2014 1 n+\\ By giving m and n different values from 0 to \u0153, the value of these interaxes for any monometric form may be obtained. The foUowing values are thus deduced for several occurring forms : Trig, interaxes. Rhombic interax. Trigonal trisoctahedron, (fig. 20, see pi. 1), 20 O Dodecahedron, (fig. 7), OoO i O Hexoctahedron, (fig. 25), 30f | | 402 I J 50f f | Tetrahexahedron,(fig. 11), \u0153\u00b02 1 i \u015303 f | Tetragonal trisoctahedron, (fig. 16), 202 -j 3* 303 \\\\ % Cube, ooOoo 2 1 To construct the form 402, the octahedron is first to be projected, and its axes and interaxes drawn. Then add to each half of each trigonal interaxis, five-sevenths of its length ; and to each half of each rhombic interaxis, one-third of its length. The ex tremities of the lines thus extended, are situated in the vertices of the solid angles of the hexoctahedron 402, and by connecting them, the projection of this form is completed. 20. In the inclined hemihedral monometric forms \u2014 that is, those hemihedral forms whose opposite faces are inclined to one another and not parallel, as the tetrahedron, <tc. \u2014 the rhombic interaxes do not terminate in the vertices of the solid angles, and may therefore be thrown out of view in the projection of these solids. The two halves of each trigonal interaxis, terminate in the vertices of dissimilar angles, and are of unequal lengths.

Polarization. The mode of distinguishing uniaxial and biaxial crystals by polarization, is briefly men tioned on p. 133. For this purpose, it is most convenient to have two vertical sections of transparent tourmaline, well pohshed, and of as pale a shade of color as can be procured ; the tourmaline may be one third to half an inch in diameter, and mounted in a thin ring of cork an inch in diameter, and an eighth of an inch thick : this is a common mode of pre paring them. By placing one tourmaline against one side of a plate of mica, and the other against or near the opposite, and looking through the two, the character of the mica is readily ascertained. The mica had better be between a fourth and half a line thick, since when too thin the colored rings are very large, or may fad altogether of being distinguished. If the mica is common obhque mica, by looking through the tour malines in different directions very obliquely, a concentric series of colored ellipses (often nearly circles) wdl soon be found, and then as obhquely in the opposite direction, another hke series of ellipses. In one position of the tourmahne, the rings will on two opposite sides appear dark, and the rest light, and the inner ring will be represented by two dark spots, opposite one another ; in another position of the tourmaline, the same spots appear hght, and the rest dark. In the Phlogopite or trimetric mica, in which the divergence of the axes is small, the colored ellipses are seen in a direct view, if the mica is not too thin. The axes are so near that there is but a single series of large ellipses surrounding the two, unless a much thicker plate be used than is needed with the common obhque mica. In one position four dark spots are seen within, which are not equidistant. The dark cross, if seen in another position of the tourmalines, has one bar lighter and longer than the other. In the hexagonal or uniaxial mica, a series of concentric circles are seen in a direct view. In one position, four dark spots (inner circle) are seen about the centre, which are equidistant. In another, a symmetrical dark cross appears. If the mica is quite thin, the circles may not be seen, and only the dark spots by looking very obhquely ; their being equidistant wdl prove the mica to be uniaxial. To measure the angles between the axes, a Wollaston's goniometer may be very con veniently used. The tourmalines with the mica between may be clamped together and then adjusted in the position of plate o, (figure on p. 89), the centre of the tourmalines being placed in the line of the axis of the instrument, and one pole vertically over the other. The mode of measurement will then be the same as when measuring the angle of a crystal. It should be performed in front of a window with a good light, and a bar of the window or some other fixed line will serve as with a crystal. For clamping the tourmalines together, a piece of sheet brass bent like a letter U will answer, if nothing better is at hand ; and if a plate like q (p. 89) is attached to the bottom of the U, it may be easdy adjusted for observation. A goniometer with a horizontal circle is still more convenient for these observations. Transverse sections of crystals of topaz, nitre, calcite, and many species give similar results. There are various other points connected with the subject, for which we must refer to Treatises on Optics.

Alteeeo Scapolite ? \u2014 A mineral of a leek-green or yellowish-green color, occurs with quartz and calc spar at Franklin, New Jersey, which is very fusible and affords on analysis a composition distinct from any related species.

Analysis 1, excluding the carbonate of lime, gives Si.54-83, Sl.34'38, Ca605, Fe 241, fig 2-33, which corresponds nearly to the formula 2 R Si-(- 3 Si Si. The mineral appears from the crystalline forms it presents to have the crystallization and angles of Scapolite, although unlike this species in hardness and fusibility. It gave for the pyramidal angle 136\u00b0, which is the angle a : a of Scapolite. The elements in its composition are in the same proportions as in Scapolite, excepting that a large part of the lime present, instead of belonging to the sdicate, is united to carbonic acid. But it seems altogether probable tha'. the mineral has undergone a change, in which part of the lime of the original Scapolite has become combined with carbonic acid. The car bonate of lime is disseminated intimately throughout the mineral, sometimes in visible plates in rifts in the specimens, but mostly invisible ; and effervescence takes place readi ly with acids. A pseudomorphous sphene occurs at the same place. The occurrence of a carbonate in this Scapolite appears thus to explain the mode of existence of carbonic acid in many silicates in which it has been detected, especially of late by Hermann. 3.

Allanite, p. 354.\u2014 The annexed is another figure of the Uralorthite from Kokscharov's Memoir. It shows well the close resemblance between the form of this species and the ordinary crystallizations of epidote. A massive pitch-black mineral from Orange Co., N. Y., which has been called allanite, proves, according to an analysis by T. H. Garrett in the Laboratory of J. C. Booth, (pri vate communication from Prof, B.) to consist of sihca, oxyd of iron, and lime, with a ht tle alumina and no cerium. Atoalusite, p. 317.\u2014 Haidinger gives the angle 144\u00b0 32' for the inclination of the face P on a plane situated on the obtuser basal angle, or in other words 109\u00b0 4' for the macrodiagonal horizontal prism. Mohs makes the same angle, the angle of a brachydi agonal prism. The angle given on page 317, as determined by Teschemacher, (P : a= 144\u00b0 50'), is evidently the identical angle referred to by the above authors; and Teschemacher has recently confirmed his former conclusion that the plane a is brachy diagonal. Anokthite, p. 534. \u2014 The Thiorsauite of Genth (p. 336) is the same mineral analyzed by Forchhammer, (analysis 5, p. 335), which is also from Iceland (and not Faroe) ; and Rammelsberg observes that it is nothing but Anorthite. The small proportion of alumina is attributed to mixture with the gangue. Apatite, var. Feancolite, p. 214. \u2014 Francolite is an apatite from near Tavistock, Devon. It occurs in small masses of irregular aggregated crystals having a somewhat mammillated surface. Analysis by T. H. Henry, (Phil. Mag.

Damour in the same memoir gives the chemical characters of the mineral, and agrees with other chemists in finding it essentially pure titanic acid. He observed in three an alyses, in the first decomposing the mineral by means of bisulphate of potash, and in the 2d and 3d by sulphuric acid, 1.

Damour concludes from the excess obtained i n his analyses that part of the titanium is in the state of peroxydin the mineral, instead of titanic acid, and deduces the formula 9ri-f 2Ti; and he suggests that the crystals may have been subjected for a period to the metamorphic action of heat, and hydrogen or bituminous vapors, and thus have become in part deoxydized and changed to the iron-black color they present. Some experi ments on rutile confirmed him in the opinion that titanic acid may be thus deoxydized. Brucite, p. 200. \u2014 The following analyses of Nemalite and Brucite by Mr. Henry Wurtz, of New York, (private communication to the author), confirm Mr. Whitney's results with regard to the identity of these two minerals.

The variation from this ratio obtained by some analyses, he shows is owing to the existence of the iron both as protoxyd and peroxyd, and an incorrect determination of the proportions of the two.

The large proportion of water, and the presence of the ingredients magnesia and iron to the amount they occur, an amount hitherto unknown in the feldspars, favor Breit haupt's opinion that the crystals have undergone alteration ; and if not pseudomorphs after lepolite, they may be after some other species of the feldspar group.

This gives for the oxygen of the protoxyds, peroxyds, silica, and water, V71 : 17'93 : 24-97 : 3-04, corresponding very nearly to IJ : 12 : 16. Rammelsberg in his 4th Supplement has calculated anew the several analyses of mus covite, and lays down the formulas of the varieties. But by some oversight be makes the ratio 1 : 12 : 15 equal to j- : 9 : 12, as if 4 : 5 equals 3:4; and the formula deduced is that based on the former ratio. As the point is of some importance, we give here the ratios from his calculations, making the oxygen of the alumina 1 2, for better comparison with that of the sihca, as well as the protoxyds. A slight variation in the protoxyds. whether from impurity or not, varies largely the ratio to the other ingredients ; while the ratio between the peroxyds and sihca, since it is much nearer equality, is not liable to such fluctuations. The results (corresponding to the analyses on page 357) are as follows :"], [704, "688 APPENDIX. 1. Uto, 1-63 : 18-62': 2468 = 1'05 : 12 : 1591. 2. Broddbo, 142 : 17'76 : 2395 = 096 : 12 : 1618. 4.

The mean therefore of the five analyses from which Rammelsberg deduces his ratio is very closely 1 : 12 : 16, and if Kussin's analysis be added, it gives still more nearly this ratio ; moreover, the separate analyses correspond more nearly with 1 : 12 : 16 than 1:12: 15. Rose's. formula K'Si-f-4 Si Si, adopted by this author, is not therefore sus tained by the analyses. Neither does Kussin's analysis correspond to the ratio IJ : 12 : 15, whence Rammelsberg derives the formula flSi-f-3SlSi, but more nearly to IJ : 12 : 16J, though probably essentially 1 : 12 : 16, hke the preceding.

Taking the Fuchsite at IJ : 12 : 16, it gives the formula on p. 357. 2. Margarodite, p. 358. \u2014 The oxygen ratios for the analyses of Margarodite are given on p. 359. For comparison with the preceding, we give a tabular view of the results. 1. Delesse, 2*65 : 1646 : 24-02 = 198 : 12 : 17-51 = 099 : 6 : 876. 2.

Brewer's analyses give an excess of silica, which may be too large. From the above it is altogether probable that the ratio 1:6:9 will include all, and that they pertain to the species Margarodite. The gilbert ite, p. 684, appears to be an altered muscovite or a margarodite. 3. Biotite,-p. 360. \u2014 The chrome mica, (analysis 11, p. 360), gives the same ratio for the oxygen of the peroxyds and silica, as that characteristic of biotite ; but the whole ratio is different, and it is not known that it is uniaxial. For the Rosendal mica, (analysis 7), Rammelsberg supposes part of the hon peroxyd, and deduces the ratio 1 : 1 : 2J giving the formula 3 R2 Si+2fiSi. 4. Lepidolite ox Lithia mica, p. 361. \u2014 The Lithia micas have been the subject of study by Rammelsberg, and he concludes that in this species, as well as topaz, (p. 366), the fluorine replaces oxygen, or is in the same state of composition as the oxygen. There are several distinct chemical compounds included, and it is not definitely known that they are all biaxial. The ratios given by Rammelsberg are, a. 1:3: 6=fiSi-|-fiSi\u2014 mica of Ural, Chursdorf, Uto, Rozena, Altenberg (Stein). b. 2:9: 15=2RSi+3fiSi\u2014 mica of Zinnwald. c. 1:2: 5=3 fi Si-j-2 fi Si\u2014 mica of Juschakowa. d. 1:6: 7=fisSi+6fiSi \u2014 mica of Altenberg according to Turner. In the Ural, Chursdorf, Uto, and Rozena micas, the fluorine is to the oxygen as 1 : 20 ; in the Altenberg, (Stein), 1 : 60; in the Zinnwald, 1 : 14, or 1 : 11 ; in the Juschakowa] 1 : 8 ; in the Altenberg, (Turner), 1 : 25. The Ural mica (Turner) affords then the formula, \u2014 writing for RSi+fiSi (R04- Si03)+(R203-fSiO'), 20 [(RO+Si 03)+(RJ 03+Si 03)]-(-[(R F+SiF3)+(R2 F8+Si F3)], and in the same way the other formulas may be written out. Making O and F isomor phous, this formula becomes, [R(0, F)+Si(0, F)3]-)-[R2(0, F)3+Si(0, F)3]."], [705, "689 APPENDIX. 5.

The mean result is quite closely 1:6:4, and the same is afforded by several of the particular resydts. As Dr. Smith found no water, and Hartshorne only 05 per cent., the species is primarily anhydrous. Including the water found by Craw in his speci mens, the ratio is 1:6:4: 1. The Emerylite, as observed by Dr. J. L. Smith the discoverer and original describer of the species, occurs with the corundum of Magnesia, Asia Minor, and also that of Naxia and Niconia. 6. EuphyUite, p. 362. \u2014 The foUowing are the oxygen ratios for the analyses : 1. 1-80 : 20-88 : 22-65 = 0-95 : 11-06 : 12 2. 1-88 : 21-02 : 2257 == 100 : 11-18 : 12 3. 1-96 : 22-82 : 23*87 = 0*98 : 1147 : 12 4. : 21-72 : 23-55 : 11-07 : 12 Mean, 098 : 1119 : 12 The ratio 1:11:12 appears therefore to be that authorized by the analyses. As no water was found in the 3d and 4th analyses, the species is essentially anhydrous. In cluding the water found by Erni, the ratio becomes 1 : 11 : 12 : 3. It is still possible that 1:12:12 will prove to be the true ratio ; and in that case the ratios for margarite, emeryhte, euphyllite, and muscovite, have an obvious simple rela tion, they being respectively 1:12:8; 2:12:8; 1:12:12; 1 : 12 : 16.

The mineral Diphanite, (p. 292), resembles margarite and euphyllite, and has the ratio 1 : 4J : 3\u00a3 or 2J : 12 : 10. We have not written a formula for the muscovite. It is evident from a survey of the compounds, that there must be some more satisfactory mode of exhibiting the relations of substances, than by the formulas often made out. They frequently make diversity instead of showing relationships, and tend to mislead the eye not thoroughly acquainted with the wide variation of formula consequent on a slight change of ratio. The amount of water which analyses attbrd varies from 0 to 5 per ceut. ; and as it exists variously or not at all in micas in which the oxygen ratio is the same, there is rea son for believing it the result of a partial alteration of the mica, like that which takes place in iolite. The hydrous varieties are commonly more or less wanting in transpa rency. For an article on singular vermiform crystallizations of mica in quartz, by Fr. Alger, see Amer. J. Sci. [2], x.

There is another mica from Monmouth, N.

It resembles much the Greenwood Furnace rhombohedral mica, (biotite), externally as well as optically, but the crystals of the latter mineral when in sections, as often seen, are rhombic prisms oblique from an acute edge.

J. Sci. [2 J, vi, 250). The color fades in different specimens from a clear green into white or grayish white, showing that the nickel is not essential to the species. Platinum, p. 546. \u2014 The author is informed by J. E. Teschemacher that he has detected a large proportion of platinum with the gold of California. In an ounce of the gold in fine grains, he found about fifty granules of pure platinum. A portion of them were boiled in strong nitric acid to test their platinum character. The proportion of platinum in the gold, Mr. Teschemacher observes, is about as large as with that of South America a fact of great interest to the arts as well as science.

There may be still some titanic acid with the silica. The state of oxydation of the iron was not particularly determined. But considering it protoxyd, as indicated by the excess in the analysis, it affords the formula Fe Si-(-Ca2 Ti. (Private communication). Serpentine. \u2014 Metaxite. \u2014 Marmolite, p. 256. \u2014 The serpentine localities of Texas, Lan caster Co., Pa., afford many varieties of serpentine, or serpentine-like minerals, which so graduate into one another that it is difficult to distinguish them into species. Shepard's wilhamsite (p. 256) is from this locality. The following are other analyses of allied varieties : 1, 2, W. H. Brewer, (Silhman, Jr., Proc. Amer. Assoc. in 1849, p. 134) ; 3, G. J.

Mr. Hartwell had measured the angles, and presented a notice of the crystal to the meeting of the American Scientific Association at Cambridge, in 1849. On examination the author finds that the crystal is monoclinic, and further that Spodumene is actually isomorphous with Pyroxene. The annexed figure rep resents the crystal as it is, with a vertical plane b3 on the right and the corresponding one on the left wanting, and also with the two planes o' and o\" unmated ; more over the back planes of the summit are absent, as the crystal is not entire or is broken on that part. The edge of intersection of o' and o\" is uncertain, as the surface has been abraded. But the rest of the faces figured are smooth, though not bright. The crystal which Mr. Hartwell's zeal has brought to light is 2J inches long, if- inches wide, and 1 inch thick. The color is grayish, with a tinge of green. Besides the usual cleavages \u2014 the orthodiagonal perfect, and the prismatic scarcely less so \u2014 there are distinct traces of cleavage parallel to each orthodiagonal edge of the pyramid a \u2014 a direction pointed out on the figure by the dotted line on plane M The surface of plane M more over is very finely crossed by lines corresponding to this cleavage direction.

This mineral, on account of its softness, translucency, and fine texture, is worked in a lathe into inkstands and other articles, which have a very neat appearance. A steatitic Pleonast from Monzoni, has afforded the following results : 1, Stadler, (Pogg. lxii); 2, Marignac, (Bib.

Titanic Iron, p. 432. \u2014 Hermann infers that titanic iron contains protoxyd of hon and titanic acid, instead of peroxyds of iron and titanium, as suggested by Rose, (see p. 433), and he makes Pe, FeTi, Fe2Ti3 isomorphous, (J. f. pr.

Rammelsberg objects to this view, remarking on the improbability of it, and stating that the hypothesis of isomorphism between compounds of the kind mentioned is alto gether an assumption.
