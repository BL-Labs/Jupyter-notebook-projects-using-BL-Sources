II. B"], [16, "HAD property of Lord Blantyre : there are several marble Statues, as large as life, of The Dukes of Lauderdale, lying on slabs of slate; and the Monument of John Maitland, Baron of Tliirlstane, Lord High Chancellor of Scotland, is graced by an Epitaph composed by his Royal Master James the Sixth. In the Town is a very elegant Chapel, for those of the Episcopal Communion, which was built in 1765, by private Subscription. It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, (comprising the Suburbs of Nungate, and Gifford-gate) was 4049, and, in 1811, was 4370. It is 16 m. E. from Edinburgh, and 373 m. N. from London. The Market is on Friday, for corn, and is perhaps the largest in Scotland. The Fairs are holden on the second Tuesday in July, and the second Thursday in October. It is a Burgh of great antiquity ; and is governed by a Provost, two Merchant Baillies, one Trades' Baillie, a Dean of Guild, a Trea- surer, eleven Merchant Counsellors, one Trades' Counsellor, and seven Deacons of Crafts. The Revenues ofthe Town, arising chiefly from the rent ofthe Mills, petty Customs, and feu duties of Glades-Muir, amount to about \u00a3400. per annum. Hadington, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Jedburgh, North Berwick, and Lauder, send one Member to Parliament. It is a neat, well built Town, situate on the banks ofthe river Tyne ; and consists of four streets, inter- secting each other at nearly right angles ; having a neat Town-House, built after a design ofthe late William Adam, Esq., in 1748; and a large and com- modious School, with suitable Lodgings for the Masters, and excellent accom- modation for Boarders. There is no legal Parochial School : the Salaries of the teachers of Public Grammar, and the English School, being paid wholly by the Town Council, out of the Revenue ofthe Burgh: the Salary ofthe Rector of the Grammar School is 400 merks Scotch, and that of the Master of the English School, to which the Office of Music Master is conjoined, is about \u00a315. Sterling. The Public Roads are good ; but many of the Private Roads are in bad repair, owing to the nature ofthe soil, which is in general clayey, and to the great scarcity of materials in many parts ofthe County. It is a General Post- Office Town : and here the Sheriff's, and County Courts are holden. In May 1598, about a third part ofthe Town was accidentally burned : and, on the 4th of October, 1775, the Tyne rose seventeen feet perpendicular above its usual level, when the whole Suburb of Nungate, and more than half of the Town, were laid under water. In former times it was strongly fortified, and there are several remains of the ancient fortifications. It was also, for ages, a sort of"], [17, "HAD Commercial Metropolis, where the Court of Tlie Four Boroughs assembled, under the Chamberlain, to decide on the disputes of traffic. This Parish con tains about 12,000 acres of land. The river Tyne flows through it from East to West, and nearly divides it into two equal parts : towards the West, where the Parish borders with Glades-Muir, the soil is exceedingly barren and unpro ductive : about 1000 acres, which formerly belonged to the Burgh as a Com monly, have been acquired by Mr. Buchan, of Letham, who has planted them with oak and other trees, which are in general in a thriving condition : except this District, and a portion of the Garleton Hills, and the Estate of Coalston, the whole of the Parish is arable, well inclosed, and in a high state of cultivation. It has been the most prevailing opinion, that the celebrated John Knox was born at Gifford, a village in East Lothian : but, the tradition of the country fixes his birth at Hadington. The House, in which he is said to have been born, is still shown by the Inhabitants, in one ofthe suburbs ofthe Town, called Tlie Gifford-Gate. This House, with some adjoining acres of land, continued to be possessed by the family until about 50 years ago, when it was purchased from them by The Earl of Wemyss. About a mile Eastward from the Town, are the ruins ofthe Nunnery, from which the Suburb called Nungate, or The Abbey, derives its name ; it is connected with the Town by a bridge of three arches : This Monastery was founded by Ada, mother of Malcolm the Fourth, in 1178 : and, at the time of the Reformation, its Revenues were very considerable : it was soon after erected into a Lordship, in favour of John Master of Lauderdale: it was at this Abbey that Parliament was convened on the 7th of July 1548, during the siege of Hadington, which gave consent to the marriage of Queen Mary with the Dauphin, and her education at the Court of France. There are several beautiful Seats in the neighbourhood. Mr. Grose has preserved a view ofthe Church, the Choir of which was called Lucema Laudoni\u00e6 , because of its beautiful structure ; it was defaced by Edward the First. The ground adjoin ing to the Church-yard is still denominated The Friars' Croft. According to Mr. Chalmers, James the Sixth seems to have conferred on the Corporation of Hadington, \" the office of Sherefscip\" , within its limits. It continued a Con stabulary at the Restoration, and, perhaps, throughout the reign of Charles the Second. It was a Shertffdom, at the Revolution ; and it continued so, until 1748. Soon after the Revolution, John, the second Marquis of Tweeddale, was appointed Sheriff- Principal of Hadington ; a trust, which he continued to execute, till his death, in 1713. On the 9th of January 1716, Thomas, B2"], [18, "HAL Earl of Hadington, was appointed Sheriff of this Shire, during the King's pleasure ; but was continued till his decease, in 1735. As this trust was not Hereditary, it could not be claimed, when such Jurisdictions were to be resumed by purchase, in 1748. Hadington gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble family of Hamilton, one of the Sixteen Representative Peers for North Britain, in the Imperial Parliament. See, Binning. Soon aster Oliver Cromwell had gained the decisive victory at Dunbar, a Philip Stampfield, who had holden the rank of Colonel in his army, came down to this Shire, and com menced the woollen manufacture in the neighbourhood of Hadington, under the countenance and encouragement of The Protector. It appears that Colonel Stampfield continued to carry on this manufacture after the Restoration, as the Statute Book acquaints us, that the Parliament of Scotland granted him certain immunities and privileges in the reign of Charles the Second : that Prince also conferred upon him the Honour of Knighthood. But, horrible to relate ! Sir Philip Stampfield died a violent death in 1687, by the hands of his Son. A manufacture of coarse woollen cloth is still carried on in the Town, and Suburbs. HADINGTON, SHIRE, or EAST LOTHIAN. This Shire lies along that part ofthe South bank ofthe Firth of Forth, where it falls into the German Ocean, and which, from the breadth of it, may be called more properly an arm of the sea. It is from 24 to 27 miles in length, and from 10 to 15 miles in breadth. The climate is comparatively mild and temperate; and the soil is ex ceedingly fertile, and highly cultivated. It abounds with excellent coal, lime stone, and free-stone. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 29,986, and, in 1811, was 31,164. It sends one Member to Parliament. Its criminal Trials are holden at Edinburgh. HAF-GRUNIE, ISLE, v. UNST, ISLAND HAILES, v. COLLINGTON. HAILES CASTLE, v. PRESTON-KIRK HAINING, v. SELKIRK. HAIR-STANES, v. KIRK-URD. HALF-MORTON, in the Shire of Dumfries : a Chapelry to the Parish of Langholm ; the Minister of which place performs Divine Service here, every fourth Sunday. It is in the Presbytery of Langholm, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 497, and, in 1811, was 510. It is 8 m. S. S. W. from Langholm. About the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, the Parish of Morton in Annan-Dale, (from which the Noble Family"], [19, "II A L of Morton, it is said, derive their title, and not from Morton in Nith's-dale, as is commonly supposed), was suppressed, and one half of it annexed to Wauchope, then a very small Parish, which annexation still continues by the name of Half- Morton : the other half was united to Canoby. This District is about four miles square : but, by the intervention of Middlebie on the North, and Canoby on the North-East, it is entirely separated from Langholm, to which, notwithstanding so strange and awkward a connexion, it has now been annexed for upwards of two centuries. Along the banks ofthe rivers Sark, and Logan, the soil is rich, and productive, and is well sheltered by large and thriving plantations. The Climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. Except two Farms which belong to the Pulteney Family, Sir William Maxwell, Bart., of Springkell, is the sole Pro prietor of this Parish : by whose patriotic exertions, good roads and other con siderable improvements have been made here. See, Wauchope. HALGREEN, v. CANOBY. HALIBURTON HOUSE, v. KETTINS. HALKERTON, v. LAURENCE KIRK. HALKIRK, in the Shire of Caithness : formerly a Chapelry, with the ancient Vicarage of Skinnet united, about the time of the Reformation : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 2 chalders of meal, and 2 chalders of bear, \u00a3600. Scotch, and \u00a330. Scotch for Communion elements : the glebe is, on the whole, very good land, but considerably short of the minimum, and there is great reason to believe that it has been encroached upon by the adjacent tenants in time of vacancies, and has never been inquired into : Patron, Sir John Sin clair, Bart., of Ulbster, who is also Proprietor of much more than one half of the Parish, and Superior of a considerable part of it besides his own property : The Church, and manse, are both in bad repair. It is in the Pres bytery of Caithness, and Synod of Caithness and Sutherland. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1801, was 2545, and, in 1811, was 2532. It is 7 m. S. b. E. from Thurso. This Parish is 24 miles in length, and from 7 to 12 miles in breadth. The soil is in general good, consisting in some parts of a clay or loam, with a mixture of moss ; and in others gravelly, on a cold rocky bottom. The surface is rather flat ; for, although there are several hills, yet they are of no considerable height, and gently slope from their summits to the adja cent plains, especially in the lower end ofthe Parish. The climate is cold, and variable, but not unhealthy. There are no less than 24 great and small Lakes: the most considerable of which are the Lochs of Cathel, Leurary, Loch-More, and Loch-Meady; but the largest is that of Cathel, which is 3 miles long, and"], [20, "HAL 2 miles broad: they all abound with excellent trout, and eels of different kinds and sizes : from Loch-More the beautiful river Tliurso principally originates, over which there is a good Bridge of three arches, in the neighbourhood of the Church. The principal Hill is that of Spital, from whence is a grand and ex- tensive prospect ; it derives its name from a Religious House, situate at its base, called Tlie Hospital, which was dedicated to St. Magnus, and with the surround- ing lands belonged at first to The Knights' Templars, and afterwards to the Order of St. John of Jerusalem : on its suppression, it was annexed to the Dio- cese of Orkney, and is still on the books of the Exchequer as a part of that See. Game, of all kinds, abound here. In the Highlands ofthe Parish is a Mission- House, at the distance of 9 miles from the Church, where the Minister was wont to preach every fourth Sunday as a voluntary deed, if not prevented by bad wea- ther ; an excellent Dwelling-house has lately been built there, and the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have established a Missionary for the two Parishes of Halkirk and Latheron. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is taught by an excellent master, is 300 merks, and perquisites. The Society have also a School here ; but another ofthe same kind is necessary for this exten- sive and populous Parish, if it can be obtained. There are the remains of several Chapels, especially of one at Westfield, called St. Trostan ; at Olgang Beg, called St. Peter ; at Deal, at Sibster, and at Banniskirk. The Castle or Tower of Braal, which stands on an eminence, at a short distance from the river Thurso, was of old a capital Seat of the Harolds Earls of Caithness; it is one ofthe finest edifices in this Shire, and is remarkable for its massive construction, and its extensive gardens: it now belongs to the Family of Ulbster; as does also Dirlet Castle, which is situate on a steep, high rock in the Highlands : it was built by the Sutherlands, and after their forfeiture, was given to the ancestor of Lord Reay. About 8 miles above Dirlet, stood Loch-More Castle, just on the brink ofthe Lake ofthe same name, and was the Hunting Seat \"of Ronald Chein: And near the Loch of Cathel are the awful remains of a very large fabrick, at a place called Achnavam. The Erse, and English languages are both spoken here. The Mills, in some parts ofthe Parish, are said to be, \" a very great and shameful grievance.\" Personal Services are exacted here. Various battles have been fought here, and there are several sepulchral monuments, especially at Ran gag. There are likewise many Pictish houses along the shore ; but they are now all in ruins. A General Post-Office is established at The Bridge of Halkirk, HALL-BAR, CASTLE, v. BRAD WOOD."], [21, "HAM HALLBEATH, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife ; in the Parish of Dunfermlin. This is a small Village, at the distance of 3 m. N. E. from Dunfermlin.

HAMILTON, anciently CADZOW, a Borough of Regality, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Collegiate Church ; the Stipend of the First Minister, before the late augmen tation, was 8 chalders of victual, \u00a341.. 13. .4. in money, \u00a320. for the glebe (which is now included in The Duke of Hamilton's pleasure ground), and a certain sum paid annually by way of rent for a manse, and garden : the Stipend of the Second Minister, before the late augmentation, was 6 chalders of meal, and \u00a333.. 6.. 8. in money, with a free house and garden, but no glebe: The Duke of Hamilton is Patron of both these Benefices : The Church, which is situate on the rising ground above the Town, is a handsome building, after a"], [22, "II A M design of the Elder Adams, in 1732. It is in the Presbytery of Hamilton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Par ish, in 1801, was 5908, and, in 1811, was 6453. It is 38 m. W. S. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the last Tuesday, O. S., in January, on the second Thursday in February, on the Friday after the 15th of May, O. S., the last Thursday, O. S., in June, the second Thurs day in July, the second Thursday, O. S., in August, and the second Thursday, O. S. , in November. It is pleasantly situate near the confluence of the river Avon with the Clyde, and is a handsome, though irregularly built Town. In 1456, it was erected into a free Burgh of Barony : in 1548 Queen Mary created it a free Royal Burgh ; but the rights and privileges thus acquired from the Crown, were resigned into the hands of William and Anne, Duke and Duchess of Hamilton, after the Restoration ; who, in 1670, restored to the Community its former pos sessions, and erected it into a Burgh of Regality, dependent upon them and their successors : in which state it still remains. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. In the middle of the Town is a neat Town-house and Prison. The Magistrates are indefatigable in the honourable discharge of their duty, and in the improvement ofthe place. The Residence ofthe Noble Family of Hamilton necessarily renders it a gay town ; and its Races are among the best attended in the West of Scotland. The principal manufactures are those of linen, and cabinet work. The Grammar School is most deservedly in high repute. Here are two Hospitals for the reception of 12 old men, endowed by the Family of Hamilton, and Mr. Aikman. Hamilton House or Palace, although a very su perb building, is a heavy one, and seems to have been erected at different periods ; some ofthe apartments are very large, particularly the gallery, in which are some excellent Paintings, decidedly the best in Scotland. In the middle of the great Park, about a mile from the Town, and on a rock overhanging the West bank ofthe Avon, stand the ruinous remains of Cadzow Castle, the an cient Manor House, when the circumjacent Barony was known by the name of Cadzow : having been surrendered to the Regent Murray on the 19th of May 1579, it was entirely demolished by order ot the King and Council. Upon the opposite side of the Avon, stands a showy bui ding, in imitation of a ruin, executed from a design ofthe Elder Adams : it was built by The Duke of Hamil ton, in 1730, and is said to have been intended as a representation ofthe Castle of Chaltelherault in Normandy, from which the Dukes of Hamilton have the title of Duke of Chattelherault in France. The Parish of Hamilton is about"], [23, "II A R 6 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth. The soil is in general good : but, upon the whole, it is rather a beautiful than a fertile District, and cultivation has been more successful in enriching the Scenery, than in multiplying the annual productions. Coals, lime-stone, iron-stone, and free-stone, are in abundance. The climate is healthy. The Public roads, and bridges, are in bad repair. The Duke of Hamilton is Proprietor of more than one-half of the Parish, and the remainder is holden of His Grace in feu. The late celebrated William Cullen, M. D., was a native of this place. The Collegiate Church was founded in the year 1451, by Sir James Hamilton, of Cadzow, ancestor to the Dukes of Hamilton, for a Provost, and several Prebendaries : it stood close to the Palace, and was highly ornamented in the Gothic style : but it is now all pulled down, except the aisle, which covers the family burying vault : Mr. Grose has pre served a view of it. Hamilton gives the title of Duke to the Ancient and Illus trious Family of Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton in Scotland, Chattelherault in France, and Duke of Brandon, and Baron Dutton, in England, &c, Here ditary Keeper of The Palace of Holyrood-House. HAMILTON FARM, in the Under Ward, and Shire of Lanark : in the Parish of Rutherglen. This is the Estate, and elegant Mansion of William SOMERVILLE, Esq. HANDA, ISLAND, off the Western Coast of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Edderachylis. It is separated from the Mainland by a narrow Sound, through which vessels occasionally pass with good Pilots. This Island is a mile square, having some fertile spots, productive of corn and hay ; but it is principally appropriated to a sheep walk. On the North side, it is one tremen dous rock, which, during the season of incubation, is frequented by prodigious numbers of sea fowls of all kinds. It is inhabited, and is rented at about \u00a312. Sterling per annum. This was once the residence of Little John Mac Dhoil Mhich Huishdan, one of the Macleods, of Assint, and the murderer of Judge Morison, of Lewis, in the reign of James the Sixth.

The Resident Population of the Parish of Harra, in 1801, was 725, and, in 1811, was 691. Here is a School, which is supported partly by a mortification left by Nicol Spence, and partly by a small gratuity given by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge ; the Salary is \u00a310., together with some small perquisites. See, Birsa. HARRIS, or NAHERADH, i. e. The Herries or Heights, a District of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : Here are seven stated places of Public Worship ; the two nearest each other being 9 miles distant, and the two most re mote, 36 miles ; there is a Missionary, supported by the Committee of the General Assembly for managing the Royal Bounty, and settled in the Northern District, who has to officiate in three of these places ; the fixed Pastor attends the other four : there are two Churches of stone and lime with slated roofs ; the one at Rowd hill having been repaired, and the other built, by the late Alexander Macleod, Esq., of Macleod, the Patron and sole Heritor : the Stipend, in 1811, was 1000 merks Scotch-The Teinds were valued in 1754: the glebe islet at \u00a35. per. annum, and the Incumbent accommodates himself with a comfortable Farm-house in lieu ofa manse: By an old standing regulation, the Inhabitants of the two Southernmost Islands, Pabay and Berneray, have a right to the attendance of the Minister for Public Worship, only once a quarter ; and the access to these Islands, from the Main-land of Harris, where he resides, is so difficult and pre carious, that, in the Winter season especially, they are frequently disappointed. It is in the Presbytery of Uist, and^ Synod of Inverness. The Resident Population of this Parish was,"], [25, "H A R In 1801. In 1811.

The Parish of Harris constitutes the Southern Part of Lewis, from which it is separated by an Isthmus of about 6 miles, that is formed by the approximation of the two great Harbours, Loch Resort, and Loch Seaforth. It is the highest and most mountainous part of The Long Island ; its Eastern coast being washed by the Channel, which separates The Long Island from Skye and the Continent: its Western coast is washed by the Great Atlantic Ocean, and, on the Southern extremity, it is bounded by the Parish of North Uist, from which it is separated by a narrow Sound, running between the Island of Berneray and North Uist, called Caolas Uist, i. e. The Sound of Uist. The whole length may be estimated at 25 or 26 miles : its breadth is extremely various, being intersected by several arms of the sea : but it generally extends from 6 to 8 miles. Harris is again naturally divided into two Districts, by two arms ofthe sea, called East and West Loch Tarbert, which approaching to one another, leave an Isthmus of not more than a Quarter of a mile in breadth. \u2014 The Northern District, between Tarbert and Lewis, is termed The Forest, though without a tree or shrub, because it is the resort of the Deer, and is alleged to have been a Royal Forest ; its surface is exceedingly mountainous, the summits rising in the roughest and most broken appearance ; the vallies contain some pasture, and coarse grass is also found growing in the interstices of the mountains. Along the Eastern and Western shores, there are numbers of creeks and inlets ofthe Sea, most of them commo dious Harbours, at each of wdiich small Colonies of Tenants contrive, by a vast exertion of industry, to raise crops from a soil ofthe most forbidding aspect. \u2014 The Southern District, within Tarbert, is much ofthe same appearance as the Northern, but the hills are not so elevated, and the coasts are better adapted for culture, and are consequently better peopled. \u2014 The District of Harris can never be enriched by agriculture ; the soils now under culture are, in general, poor; and, of the waste lands, the far greater part will entirely baffle the art of tho C 2"], [26, "H A R Husbandman for ever. The manure chiefly used is Sea-weed, of which great quantities are cast ashore by the Winter storms in the South Islands, and in a few places on the West of Harris within Tarbert, and in Taransay. There is neither lime-stone, nor marie, in the Parish, nor in any part of The Long Island. Kelp is the staple, and, excepting the few Cows sold to the drovers, the only valuable article of exportation which the District produces ; the quantity made being about 450 tons. The Baron-Baillie Court of Macleod, the Chief, is the only Court of Justice in the Parish. The coasts abound with fish of all kinds ; and the flocks of aquatic birds are so prodigious, and various, that the names of many of them are unknown : game is also in great plenty. Here are several Chalybeate springs. The Mountains, withont doubt, contain many fossil trea- sures : but no mineral of value, except some iron and copper ore, has been discovered : granite, and freestone, abound in every part. There are many monuments of Druidism ; and several ancient Religious edifices, erected about the time of the introduction of Christianity among the Scottish and Pictish nations. The Churches of more modern date are called after Saints, whose names are well known in the Roman calendar, viz., St. Bride, St. Rufus, St. Luke, and St. Mary : and, these, together with the smaller Chapels belonging to them, all seem to have depended immediately on the Priory of Canons Regular at Rowdhill, dedicated to St. Clement, and which, though its foundation be attributed to Macleod, of Harris, is generally supposed to be of more ancient date. The Salary, and emoluments of the Parochial School at Rowd- hill, are about \u00a320. per annum : And the benevolent and patriotic Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have erected there a Seminary of Female industry. The Climate is healthy. The Gaelic is universally spoken here. \u2014 The Sound of Harris, which is a navigable Channel, between the Islands of Harris and North Uist, is 9 miles in length, and the same in breadth : it is the only passage for vessels of burden, going from the East to the West side of that long cluster of Islands, called Tlie Long Island: it is much encumbered with rocks and small Isles ; but, with a skilful Pilot, can be passed in safety. The fish in this Sound are of a greater size, and more numerous, than in other parts of the Islands, and on this account it was made one of the Fishing Stations, begun in the reign of Charles the First, but unfortunately relinquished in the reign of Charles the Second. Of the Uninhabited Isles, belonging to the Northern District, several small ones are placed round the Bays and Harbours of Scalpay, and along all the Creeks of the East coast of Harris ; these are"], [27, "HAT Fladday, G'aaskeir, Isay, Skeotisvay, and Mickle and Little Soay. \u2014 Ofthe Uninhabited Isles, belonging to the Southern District, some are of consider able extent : a few of them may measure a mile in length, and about half a mile iu breadth. They are covered with heath, and moss, and afford pretty good Summer pasturage. The shores are lined with Sea-weed. The Inhabitants of Berneray, Ensay, Killigray, and Pabay, repair to them with their families and cattle, in the season for the manufacture of kelp. Here most of them get peats for fuel, there being no moss in any of the Inhabited Islands of this District, except Killigray ; and, to procure this necessary article, some of them have to go through a most dangerous navigation, the distance of almost three leagues. The names of the largest are Copay, Gillisay, Groay, Haay, Hermitray, Hulmitray, Lingay, Neartay, Opsay, Saartay, Sagay, Scarvay, Skeilay, Stromay, Suursay, Torogay, Vaaksay, and Vote rsay, See, Long Island, and Skye, Isle.

HASSENDEAN, in the District of Hawick, and Shire of Roxburgh : The Church, and greatest part of the Church-yard, have been washed away by the river Teviot ; but Mr. Cardonell has preserved a drawing of the ruins, con sisting chiefly of an Arch, \" which is the East end of the Choir, that is of Saxon architecture, and is of no inelegant design.\" Here was formerly a Cell, which was dependent on the Abbey of Melros : the old Tower of Hassendean was called The Monks' Tower ; and the Farm, adjoining to the Church, continues to bear the Name of The Monks' Croft. After the Reformation, the Church of Hassendean, with its pertinents, and The Monks' Tower, were granted to Walter Earl of Buccleugh: and the Parish was divided among the Parishes of Minto, Wilton, and Roberton: but the original Stipend was all annexed to Roberton. It is 4\\ m. N. E. from Hawick. See; Roberton, and Huntlaw. HATTON, v. MARY KIRK."], [28, "HAW HATTON, v. RATHO. HAUCH or HAUGH, v. PRESTON-KIRK HAUGHS, The, v. BENHOLME.

HAWICK, in the District of Hawick, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a391..13..4f in money, 16 bolls of meal, 20 bolls of barley, the Vicarage Tythes of a small part of the Parish, a manse and garden, and a glebe of 15 English acres : Patron, The Duke of Buc cleugh : The Church was built in 1214, and was dedicated to St. Mary. It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resi dent Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2798, and, in 1811, was 3688. It is 47 m. S. S. E. from Edinburgh. Here is a weekly Market on Thursday; and four Fairs annually, besides a great Tryst, which has been established for Black Cattle, in the Month of October. It is a Burgh of Barony, independent of the Lord of erection, and appears to have existed free, from a very early period : but the Rights and Documents of the Burgh being either lost or destroyed, during the inroads of the English Borderers, a Charter was granted, in the year 1545, by James Douglas, Baron of Drumlanark, confirming to the Burgesses such rights and lands as they formerly possessed : This Charter was confirmed by another, which was granted by Queen Mary, in the Month of May 1545. In consequence of these Charters, the Burgesses elect their Magis trates annually, viz., 2 Baillies, and 2 Quarter-masters from each of the seven Corporations of Weavers, Tailors, Hammermen, Skinners, Butchers, Shoe makers, and Bakers, which, with 15 of a Standing Council who are elected for"], [29, "HAW life, manage the affairs ofthe Town. A Treasurer and Surveyor of Weights, Measures, and Markets, are annually chosen by the Council. The Clerk is elected by the Burgesses at large, and generally continues in office during life. It possesses all the immunities and privileges of a Royal Burgh, except that of sending Members to Parliament, for which it need not repine. Here is a neat Town-House, erected by the Magistrates with the revenue derived from the property belonging to the Town ; and who have also conveyed water throughout the Town in leaden pipes, to the great convenience of the Inhabitants. There is a considerable trade carried on here in the manufacture of what are called, Scotch Carpets; \u2014 the manufacture of inkle, cloth, and stockings, is also conducted here with spirit and success. This Parish is of great extent, being about 15 miles in length from East to West, and about 4\u00a7 miles in breadth. The general appearance is hilly ; but none of the hills are of remarkable size ; they are mostly green, and afford excellent pasture for Sheep, the breed of which is much attended to here. The soil is various ; as is also the climate, whether in the Town, or its immediate neighbourhood. The Town is situate at the confluence ofthe small river Slitridge with the Teviot, and is well built ; but, from its contiguity to those rivers, there is frequent apprehension of inundation, and from which it suf fered in the month of August 1767. In 1570, it was burnt by the English, under the command of Lord Sussex. The celebrated Gavin Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld, author of several poems, and the translator of Virgil's \u00c6neid, was installed Rector of Hawick, in 1496: he died ofthe Plague in Londoa, and was buried in Tlie Savoy Church, in the year 1522. Here too must be mentioned, The Rev. Alexander Orrock, the first Minister of Hawick after the Revolu tion : he appears to have been a man rigid in discipline, and of extensive charity, eminent proofs of which still remain : he bequeathed, for the Poor of Hawick, 116 merks Scotch; and, for the Schoolmaster, 9,000 merks: he gave several pieces of Plate for the use of the Church ; and to the Minister he gave his whole Library, which remains a monument of ancient Theological literature. There are evident marks of several military stations, both circular and rectangular ; and, a little above the Town, towards the West, is an earthen Mound, of a conical figure, called The Mote or Late, where, it is thought, the Baronial Jurisdiction was exercised in former times. There is also an ancient mound, called Catrail; which, Mr. Whitaker, in his History of Manchester, supposes to have been a barricade, thrown up by the ancient Britons ; and adds, \" it runs in a North East direction from Carnaby on the Esk, to Gallow Water, beyond Selkirk, lined"], [30, "II E B all the way on the West with Forts ; and even continues itself, by an additional chain of Castles, along the Gallow, lo the North. It was plainly designed as a barrier against any enemy, that lay to the South and East of it.\" Its remains in the Parish of Cavers, and on the Gallow, are still conspicuous ; but little of it is observable in this Parish. On the abolition of Heritable Jurisdictions, in 1747, The Duke of Buccleugh, to whom this Baronial town belongs, was compen sated for its Regality, with an allowance of \u00a3400. HAWKSTONE, v.

These are the cluster of Islands, which lie to the West of the Mainland of Scotland, in the Atlantic Ocean, extending from the Northern extremity or Butt of Lewis, in the Latitude of 58\u00b0 35' North, to the small Island of Sanda, on the coast of Cantyre, in the Lati tude of 55\u00b0 22' North ; though, by sortie Geographers, The Isle of Man, in the Irish Sea, is considered as one of the cluster. They comprehend several large Islands, which are divided among the different Shires, on the Western coast of the Kingdom : of these, the chief are Lewis, and, its smaller Islands, which be long to the Shire of Ross : \u2014 Barray, Eigg, Harris, North Uist, South Uist, Skye, and the smaller neighbouring Islands, attached to the Shire of Inverness: \u2014 and Canna, Muck, Rum, Gigha and Cara, Collonsay and Oronsay, Tir-y and Coll, Mull, Jura, and Islay, with several smaller Islands, which belong to the Shire of Argyle. \u2014 To these may be added, those Islands which lie in the Firth of Clyde, to the Eastward of the Peninsula of Cantyre, viz., Bute, Arran, Great and Little Cumbray, and Inch-Marnock, which constitute the Shire of Bute. They are called by the general name of Ebudce by the ancients, who appear to have been acquainted with little more of the Hebrides than the bare names. Their early history is involved in great obscurity ; the Danes, and Nor wegians, made frequent descents upon them ; and, at length, Harold Harfager, King of Denmark, and Norway, about the end of the Ninth Century, o-ot firm possesion of the greater part of them, and appointed a Viceroy or Governor. One ofthe Danish Viceroys, however, threw off his dependence on the mother coun try, and declared himself King of Tlie Isles, and fixed the seat of his Govern ment in Tlie Isle of Man; where he and his successors, for several generations"], [31, "II E L were sometimes independent, and at other times tributary, according to the vicissitudes of their affairs. With one of these Kings or Viceroys, Somerled, a powerful Chieftain of Cantyre, formed a matrimonial alliance ,>bout the begin ning ofthe Twelfth Century; and, some time after, in 1158, availing himself of the troubles of that period, set up for an independent Prince, and separated The Western Isles and Cantyre from the Crown or Viceroyalty of Man. After this, by conquest or treaty, he made himself master of a great part of the Shire of Argyle ; but not satisfied with the extent of his possessions, and elated with his former success, he formed the design of subjecting all Scotland to his power ; in which ambitious attempt he fell a sacrifice, in 1164, in a great battle fought with Malcolm the Fourth, near Renfrew. The effects of this disaster were long severely felt by his family, who, instead of attempting new conquests, were hardly able to preserve the territories of their father : but, in 1335, we find the descendents of Somerled again independent, and Donald, the ancestor of the Macdonald Family, in possession of the Sovereignty of The Isles ; and who, having acquired the Earldom of Ross by marrying the daughter of Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross, became the most powerful Subject of Scotland. Tlie Lordship of Tlie Isles continued in the possession of the Macdonald family for many years ; but, having offended the Kings of Scotland by their haughty con duct, they were reduced from the situation of an independan t Prince to that ofa powerful Baron; and the Family is still represented by the present Lord Macdonald.

HELMSDALE, in the Shire of Sutherland : and in the Parish of Loth : The Chapel is dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It is 244 m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This is a small village, situate upon the Northern bank ofthe rapid river Helmsdale, at its junction with the German Ocean. The salmon fishery is very productive, and is rented by a Company from the Sutherland Family. Near it are the ruins of a square Tower, which was built in the Fifteenth century, by Lady Margaret Baillie, Countess of Sutherland. An excellent bridge of two arches, each of 70 feet span, has been erected here over the river Helmsdale, under the auspices of The Parliamen tary Commissioners. HEMPRIGGS, v. WICK. HENDERLAND, v.

HERDMANSTON, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Salton. In the Thirteenth Century a Chapel was erected here by John de St. Clair, by the leave of the Canons of Dryburgh, to whom he granted two acres of land, with an indemnity, that his Chapel should not injure the Mother Church of Salton. It is 4 m. S. W. from Hadington. This is the Seat of the ancient Baronial family of St. Clair, Lord Sinclair. HERDMANSTUN, v. LILLIES-LEAF. HERIOT, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements \u25a0 the glebe is about 14 Scotch acres : Patron, Sir John Dalrymple, Bart., of Cran ston: The Church, and Manse, are both in very bad repair. It is in the Pres bytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages and Estates of Carcant,"], [33, "H E T Chapel, Crookstoun, Dewar, Fala-Hill, and Heriot) was 320, and, in 1811, was 300. It is 4 m. S. b. E. from Middleton. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth : towards the North-East, the surface is level ; and, on the banks ofthe Gala and Heriot waters, there are some fertile meadows, but the general appearance is hilly, inclining to mountain : these are covered with heath, interspersed with patches of grass, which afford excellent sheep pasture : and great quantities of ewe cheese are made here. The Roads are in tolerable repair. Coals, peat, and turf, are used for fuel ; the two latter are abundant, and the former is brought from Stobhill, about six or seven miles dis tant. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The air is salubrious, and the Inhabitants are in general very robust and healthy. There are the remains of several ancient fortifications, generally ofa circular form; and a huge Cairn, on Heriot- Town Hill- Head, about 70 or 80 feet in diameter. On the side of the Gala road, near the Bridge over the water of Heriot, and behind a Weaver's cottage, belonging to the Abbey of Melros, is a Circle ; to which place horses, cattle, and sheep were driven, when they were poinded or rouped for behoof of the Creditor. The Barony of Heriot is now divided among several Proprietors. An unfortunate woman, called Mary Gib, was burned for a Witch upon a great stone here, which still goes by her Name. The Proprietors of this Parish are not only themselves averse to build ing, but they decline granting feus to others to build upon. There is not a feued house in all the Parish. The practice of led Farms prevails here, and at present (in 1811) nearly one-half ofthe Parish is under the management of only two Shepherds. The Fair at Heriot-House is holden on the first Friday aster the 26th of May. HERMITAGE, v. CASTLE-TOWN.

HIGHLANDS, one of the greater Divisions of Scotland, applied to the Mountainous part ofthe Country to the North and North-West, in contradis tinction to the Lowlands, which occupy the East and South-East District. The Highlands comprehend that immense tract of mountainous country, which reaches from the Grampians quite to the extremity ofthe Island. This high and rugged region is in several places intersected with Firths and chains of Lakes, forming so many natural divisions of the country. Of these, two are more re markable than the rest ; the First, or principal one, is that which extends, almost in a direct line, from Inverness, on the Moray Firth, to the arm ofthe Western Ocean called the Linnhe Loch, whereon Fort William is situate : the Second opens likewise into the Moray Firth, extending from thence along the Firth of Dornoch, and Loch Shin, to Loch Laxford, on the West Sea. Naturalists have observed, that the ranges of mountains, or high lands, whether in Continents or Islands, over the face of the whole globe, which run nearly in a Meridional direction, are always situate next to the Western shore, and consequently have their steepest face presented that way, sloping gradually towards the East. Some have even attemped to assign the primary cause to which this wonderful circumstance is owing. Without, however, entering into any speculative dis quisition concerning that point, we need only take notice, that this is remark ably the case with regard to the Island of Great Britain. For here the highest lands throughout its whole length, are situate nearest to the West Coast, having a gradual descent towards the East, which is in general a flat and level shore. Accordingly we find, that the mountainous region of Scotland, comprehended between the Grampians, and the first, or great chain of Lakes, becomes lower as it approaches towards the East Coast, in such sort that a very considerable part ofthe Shires of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray, watered by the Dee, Don, Ithan, Deveron, Spey, and Findhorn, as far as the river Ness, is in general a low and level country. The Highlands are generally sub-divided into two parts, The West Highlands, and The North Highlands ; the former of which contains the Shires of Dumbarton, Bute, part of Perth and Argyle, with the Islands be longing to them ; and the latter comprehending the Counties of Inverness, Ross, Sutherland, Caithness, the Districts of Athol, Rannoch, and the Isles of Skye,"], [35, "II I L Lewis, and others, which belong to Inverness and Ross : \u2014 The Districts of Breadalbane, Marr, and Monteith, forming a third or central division. Great improvements have been introduced into these wild regions ; and, by the aid ofthe excellent Roads and Bridges, and The Great Caledonian Canal, which have been made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, the High landers will be enabled to avail themselves of their mines, their woods, their wool, and their fisheries. Two Districts of the Highlands, according to General Roy, seem so very singular, and at the same time so different in their natures, as to deserve to be mentioned. The first is a great Plain, called The Moor of Rannoch, situate in the centre ofthe highest Mountains of Scotland : It is a desert about 20 miles square, extending from the hills of Glen Lyon, as far as Ben Nevis in Loch-Aber \u2022 flat and morassy in its nature, and wholly without inhabitants or cultivation. The second comprehends some part of Coigach, Assint, and Edderachylis, stretching along the North-West coast, as far as Loch Inchard, being in length about 24 miles, and in breadth eight or ten. This, though appertaining to the mountainous region of the country, is nevertheless very dif ferent from the adjoining- Highland Districts ; for without being so renasb-kably high, it is infinitely more rugged and broken than any other part of BrMih, In order to convey any tolerable idea of a country so very extraordinary in its nature, we may suppose some hundreds of the highest mountains split into many thou sands of pieces, and the fragments scattered about. Between these lumps of rocks are numberless ponds of fresh water. Here and there, too, a cottage is to be seen, with a spot of cultivated ground, not in general tilled, for it is but in few places that it is possible to make use of a plough, but dug with a mattock in the interstices between the splinters ofthe rocks. The wood to be met with here is chiefly birch ; without, however, growing to any great size ; and through the general mass the sea, from distance to distance, indents itself far into the land, forming a scene the most wild and romantic that can be imagined.

It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale, The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 760, and, in 1811, was 709. It is 5\u00b1 m. S. E. from Hawick. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and about 3 miles in breadth : it is watered by the river Rule, on the banks of which the soil is a deep fertile clay : but, at a distance from the river, it is thin and sandy : it abounds with freestone ; and, beyond Winbrough, there are very good limestone quarries. The air is rather moist, but not unhealthy. This Parish is famous for the best breeding grounds, which produce Sheep of an excellent quality, and distinguished for a fine staple of wool. The turnpike road, from Edinburgh to Newcastle, runs through the Parish : it was made at the expense of the County, and is kept in repair by the tolls. A species of agates, like the Bristol stones, are sometimes found in the bed of the water. It obtained the name of Hope-Kirk, from the local situation ofthe Church, in one of those small Vales, to which the term Hope is generally applied, in the South of Scotland : The Kirk, and Village, stand at the entrance"], [37, "HOD of the little valley upon the river Rule ; and the manse is situate at the top of the same Vale or Hope, three hundred yards distant. It formerly belonged to The Canons of Jedburgh. The most remarkable Mountains in the Parish are Winbrough, and Fanna. At Stobhall, the Seat of the Elliots, of Stobs, was born the admirable and gallant Elliot, Baron Heathfield, well known for his brave defence of the Garrison of Gibraltar, against the united forces of France and Spain. HODDOM, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Mensal Church to the See of Glasgow, and now comprehending the ancient Parishes of Line, and Eccles- Fechan : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is old, and in bad repair, but the offices are in good condition : in each of the Parishes there is a glebe belonging to the Minister : Patrons, The Marquis of Queensberry, and Mr. Sharpe, of Hoddom, by turns : The Church is in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery of Annan, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801, was 1250, and, in 1811, was 1428. It is f m. S. from Eccles-Fechan. This Parish is delightfully situate in the district of Annan dale, and is about 5 miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth. The surface con sists partly of high, and partly of low ground, and of extensive holms or meadows on the banks of the rivers Annan, Milk, and Mein, by which it is watered : except a few acres of ground, incapable of culture, the whole is arable, and in a rapid state of improvement. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with the usual School-fees. The Poor's funds consist of an accumu lated capital of \u00a3400. Sterling, arising from two mortified sums ; the one, \u00a31119..19..4. Scotch, in 1701, by Mr. James Alexander, through whose means, chiefly, the three Parishes were united ; and the other, of 1000 merks, in 1715, by Mr. John Sharpe, of Hoddom. The Roads are excellent. Fuel is expen sive. Hall- Guards, the place on which the old Castle of Hoddom originally stood, is said to have been the seat of one ofthe branches ofthe family of Bruce, and to have been demolished some centuries ago, in compliance with the terms of a Border treaty : it was re-built by John Lord Herries, but afterwards removed to a more favourable situation at Cummertrees, on the other side of the Annan, where it now stands. On the South- East and North-West sides of the beautiful and celebrated Hill of Burnswark, are the vestiges of the first Roman camp to be met with in the South of Scotland, and the most entire and best preserved : its length is 922 feet, and its breadth 395 : Mr. Gordon has given a particular description, and preserved plans of it, in his Itinerary, p. 16. pi. 1. ;"], [38, "not its summit, according to Mr. Chalmers, had been previously occupied by a British strength ; and this is obviously the Trimontium of the Ninth Iter, of O 3 *\u25a0' * Richard of Cirencester.

Sterling : It appears by the Reports ofthe Presbyteries, \" That Lord Dundas has proposed to the Clergy of the Bishoprick a compromise, by retaining only half the excise duty, the Clergy paying the other half:\" This matter has not been adjusted, for this reason among others, that the main question would be left undecided, and liable to be made the ground of a process by any succeeding Tacksman : the glebe, which consists of 4\\ acres, was inclosed with a stonewall by The Rev. James Alison, and being situate upon the sea-shore, produces every three years about six tons of kelp : the manse was built in 1763 : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Nicholas, was re-built in 1781. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod of Orkney, and was formerly a part of that Bishoprick. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 871, and, in 1811, was 747. It is 4 m. S. E. from Kirkwall. From East to West this Parish is in length nearly five miles, and in breadth about one. It was formerly divided into two Parishes, with the names of Holm, and Paplay. The Division on the West had probably the first name given to it, from a little Island in the Sound, called Lamb-Holm, or Lamon: and the Eastern division, as probably, derived the name which it bore, from the people who at a very early period inhabited that fertile, and beautiful District : They have long been united under their present name, and form one of the most compact, and prosperous Parishes in the County. Through its whole extent, the soil is thin and stony, composed of a mixture of clay and sandy loam ; but, as most of the cultivated"], [39, "H O L land lies on a gentle declivity, fronting the South, and is at the same time more improved than other parts, their crops are always better than those of their neigh bours. Their Houses are well built, clean, and neat : their little gardens are in good order; and, besides raising bear and oats, it is pleasant to behold little patches of their farms inclosed, where they have some ofthe artificial grasses in much perfection. Flax, also, for many years past, has been raised with good effect in this Parish by the ordinary Farmers ; who, in the winter season or other intervals of agricultural labour, prepare and dress it ; when the females ofthe family spin it, to be manufactured into linen, of a grist or fiueness between nine and eighteen hundred, which is commonly sold at the English market for a good price, to the amount of 20,000 yards annually. The entrance ofthe Sound, on the West, is formed by a Promontory, called How-Quoy Head, and, on the East, by another Promontory, named Rose-Ness: in the middle of the Sound, nearest the West entry, there is a little Island almost circular, called Lamb-Holm; it is about three miles in circumference, and belongs to this Parish ; it contains one Farm, and between it and the Mainland, a pretty secure Harbour is constituted for Ships of 200 tons burden, and a small Pier is run out, where Vessels of 50 tons may lie along side ; it is termed Holm Sound Bay. Through this part of the Sound, the Post between Kirkwall and Edinburgh crosses, to the distance of about half a league. The shoi%s in general are low and rocky, yielding to the pro prietors, communibus annis, about 50 tons of kelp, besides a very considerable quantity of sea-ware for manure. The interjacent space, between the four ad joining Parishes and Holm, is an undivided Common, which is separated from the arable ground by an earthen dike. This Common is covered with heath and moss, from which the Inhabitants of these surrounding Parishes are supplied with peats and turf, their only fuel. It abounds with moor-fowl, ducks, teals, snipes, and green and grey plovers. Services are required from the Cotters ; who, when employed, are always maintained. The Climate, though moist, is nevertheless salubrious, and the Inhabitants attain to a considerable age. Captain Alexander Gr\u00e6me, ofthe Royal Navy, whose behaviour on the Dogger Bank acquired him the esteem of the Public, and the approbation of His Sovereign, is almost the sole Proprietor. This worthy Family, for upwards of 100 years, resided at their family Seat of Graeme's Hall, and by their example and encouragement pro moted a spirit of industry in the Inhabitants : from the first settlement of the Family here, to the present day, the Proprietor has not raised the original rents; and some ofthe Ancestors ofthe present Tenants have possessed the same Farm, vol. il E"], [40, "H O L for time immemorial. The only properly made road in Orkney, is that which leads from Kirkwall to this Parish ; being the road which the Post-boy pursues, on foot, with the mail for the South. HOLMAINS, v. DALTON.

HOLY-DEAN, or HALYDEAN, in the District of Melros, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Bowden. It is 2| m. S. b. W. from Melros. There was, not long ago, a strong fortification here, which was once a Residence ofthe Ducal family of Roxburgh. The Court-yard, containing about three quarters of an acre, was surrounded by strong stone and lime walls, 4 feet thick, and 16 feet high, with slanting holes, between sive freestones, about 30 feet from each other ; from which an arrow or musket could have been pointed in different directions : within the Court stood two strong Towers, one of them three and the other five stories high, containing eight or ten lodging rooms, besides por ters' lodges, servants hall, vaulted cellars, bake-houses, &c. : the roof and floor ing were all of the strongest oak : but, during the minority of the late Duke whilst His Grace was abroad, and without his knowledge, his then Commis sioner ordered the greatest part of this building to be pulled down, merely for"], [41, "H O L the sake of getting the freestones in them, to build a large Farm-house and ap purtenances, at the distance of three miles: \u2014 some of the vaults still remain, and are used by the tenant ; and about 160 feet of the Court wall are perfectly entire : one stone, preserved from the ruins, and now a lintel to the door of the Farm-house at Holy-Dean, has in the middle an unicorn's head and three stars, with this Inscription on either side : \u2014 Feer God. Flee Everlasting from sin mak to the end to the lyfe I ' Dem Isabel Ker 1530. About 140 yards from the principal Tower, on the summit of a precipice hang ing over a burn, there have been a Chapel, and a burying-ground, as appears from a number of grave-stones, handles of coffins, and human bones, which have been dug up from time to time. It was a Grange of the Monks of Kelso. But, the greatest curiosity, is a stone dike without lime, which incloses about 500 acres of this farm, and has stood more than 300 years, yet is still a tolerable fence : it has originally been 6 or 7 feet high, with capstones : in an old tack, this inclosure is called, \" The great Deer Park of Haliedean,\" and was once full of wood ; but it has long been subdivided, and all the trees cut down, except a few old Birches : in the mosses here, as well as in other parts of Scotland, many birch, fir, and oak trees have been discovered, from 3 to 8 feet below the surface ; together with human bones, and the horns of different animals of an uncommon size. In 1569, Walter Ker, of Cessford, obtained, for Border services, a grant ofthe lands of Halydean. HOLY ISLE, v, LAMBLASH, ISLAND. HOLY LOCH, v. KILLMUN. HOLYROOD ABBEY, and PALACE, v. CANONGATE. HOLY WOOD, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150, : the manse, and offices, were built in 1773: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Rev. James Macmil lan: The Church was built in 1779. It is in the Presbytery of Dumfries, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 809, and, in -18 11, was 830. It is 3 m. N. W. from Dumfries. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and a mile and a half in breadth, and contains about 7500 acres. The surface is in general level, with a few rising grounds at the North ern extremity : the soil is mostly arable, and fertile ; and the few eminences, E 2"], [42, "HOM which are not under culture, produce excellent pasture. It is watered by the rivers Nith, and Cluden, which abound with fish of various kinds. The air is dry, and remarkably wholesome. Fuel is expensive. There are two Parochial Schools, with good school-houses, which were, built in 1782. The greatest part of the Parish is thirled to the mill of Cluden, and pays a very high multure, which greatly tends to retard the cultivation and improvement of the District. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The late Charles Irvine, Esq., Sur- geon, was a native of this Parish ; and was the person who, many years ago, discovered the method of rendering salt water fresh, for which he was rewarded by government with a grant of \u00a35000. Within half a mile of the Church, is a large Druidical Temple, that was formerly surrounded with a grove of oak trees, from whence the Parish is supposed to have derived its name : Mr. Grose has preserved a View of these stones. When Christianity prevailed, this sacred ground was chosen for the site ofa Monastery, called from the Grove, Monaste- rium sacri Nemoris. This Abbey is said to have been founded by the Lady Davorgilda, daughter of Alan, Lord of Galloway, who died in 1269: it was ofthe Pr\u00e6monstratensian Order : and Johannes de sacro Bosco, a great mathe- matician, and famous for his book de Sphcera, is supposed to have been a pro- fessed Monk of this House. The last remains of it were taken down in 1778, to re-build the Parish Church. According to Keith, King Robert the Second confirmed the foundation of an Hospital made within the Monastery of Holy wood, by Archibald the Grim, Earl of Douglas. The old Tower of Cowhill, which stood upon an eminence, commanded a charming prospect of the Vale of Nith, from Friars' Carse to Dumfries. It had long been the seat of the Maxwells, Cadets ofthe Noble family of Nith's-dale. In the year 1560, the old Castle being burned by the English, this Tower was built in 1579. In 1783, Charles Maxwell Campbell, Esq., sold this place to George Johnstone, Esq., of Conhath, a merchant in Liverpool: who, soon after, pulled it down, in order to erect an elegant mansion on its site. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. HOME, or HOLM, in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Rectory, annexed to the ancient Vicarage of Stichel : The Patronage of the Church of Home, which was dedicated to Sis. Nicholas, belonged to The Earls of Dunbar, who were of old Lords of this Manor. It is in the Presbytery of Kelso, aud Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 415, and, in 1811, was 408. It is 4 m. S. b. W. from Greenlaw. The Castle,"], [43, "HOM and Village of Home, stand on the summit of a conspicuous hill, which rises 898 feet above the level of the sea. According to Mr. Chalmers, the Parish of Home, which is ancient, was of old four times the extent of the present Dis trict; during the Twelfth Century, it included a considerable part of Gordon, and West Struther. But the Monks of Kelso, having obtained the patronage of the Chapel of Gordon, in 1171, they procured the territory of Gordon, and a large part of West Struther, to be erected into a separate Parish ; by this mea sure, the old Parish of Home was nearly reduced to its present limits. The Mother Church of Home, however, retained its superiority over the Chapel of Wederley, which continues to serve the Inhabitants of the Lands of Wederley, in the present Parish of West Struther. The Castle of Home was for ages a celebrated defence to its neighbourhood, during the contentions and wars on the Borders. The territory of Home occurs as early as the year 1240, in a donation to the Monastery of Kelso, by Ada, daughter of Patrick, the fifth Earl ofDuNBAR, Wife of William, the son of Patrick, who was the second son of Gospatrick, third Earl of Dunbar. From the Lands and Castle of Home, this William took his surname, the family of March having assumed that of Dunbar a few years before. He also carried the armorial bearings of the Earl of Dunbar, which his posterity, the Family of Home, have continued to do ever since with little variation. In this Family it continued through a long succession of descendants ; among whom we find many gallant Soldiers, Ambassadors, Privy Counsellors, Statesmen, and others, occupying the liighest places of Honour and Trust. In the Parliament holden by King James the Third, in 1465, Alexander Dominus de Home sat as a Lord Baron : he was actually created a Lord of Parliament by the Title of Lord Home, on the 2d of August, 1473 : and, on the 4th of March, 1604, Alexander, the Sixth Lord Home, was, by King James the Sixth, raised to the Dignity of Earl of Home, and Baron of Dunglass. In 1513, Lord Home, the Chamberlain, obtained that beneficent immunity, from the Convention of Perth, that the Heirs of those, on the Borders, who might be killed in defending the Kingdom, should be freed from the payment of relief, for their Wardship or Marriage. This ordinance was passed, at the request of the Warden and the Border Chiefs, in imitation of a similar Act, which was made at Twizelhaugh, in Northumberland, before the battle of Floddon. This Immunity, thenceforth, settled into a general practice, as it was so often necessary to incite the enmity ofthe Borderers, and to urge their perseverance. In March 1513-14, the per sonal influence of Lord Home was such on the public Councils, that he was"], [44, "II O M appointed the Chief Justice on the Southern side of the Forth. In 1547, this Castle was surrendered to The Duke of Somerset, the particulars of which are circumstantially related by Patten. In 1549, the Scots seized it by stratagem, and slew the Garrison. The Lord Grey unsuccessfully attempted to recover it. It is said, that Oliver Cromwell, when at Hadington, sent a summons to the Governor, ordering him to surrender the Castle, but that the then Governor returned for answer ; that \" He, Willie Wastle, \" Stood firm in his Castle ; \" And that all the dogs of his town, \" Should not drive Willie Wastle down.\" And that this is the origin of a particular play, with which the Children here often amuse themselves. Oliver Cromwell, however, after considerable difficulties, made himself master of it, and in a great measure demolished it. There is a Tradition generally believed in the country, that when King James the Second went to besiege the Castle of Roxburgh, he left his Queen in Home Castle ; that one day, when she was upon the Road to visit her Royal husband, she was met about half a mile East from Stichel House, by a messenger, with the melan choly account of His Majesty's being killed by the bursting ofa Cannon. This sad news brought on her labour pains, and she was immediately delivered of a Child, upon a Hill, ever since called Queen's Cairn. Home Castle belongs at present, by purchase, to The Earl of Marchmont. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. In one ofthe Farms belonging to Sir James Pringle, in this Parish, called Hardie's Mill Place, is a Loch of about 30 acres, in which peats were for merly procured ; but, in a dry summer, cattle now feed all over it : \u2014 To the North ofthe Loch, about 200 yards distant, is a rising groimd, called Lurgie Craigs, which consists of regular ranges of basaltes, similar, but not nearly so large, as those in Arthur's Seat, on the foot-path to Dudingston from Edinburgh : They are regular polygons of about five and six feet high, and 16 or 17 inches diameter ; they stand erect and close, but not adhering to each other, so that a person with an iron crow can easily separate them : they have all the appearance of being the same with those of The Giants Causeicay in Ireland, or in some of the Western Islands of Scotland. In another Farm, belonging to Sir James Pringle called Hume-Byres, is a Hill, named Hume Pallat, about a mile from the Castle, and nearly on a level with it; upon the West end of the hill, are the distinct"], [45, "HOU remains of a Fort with a fosse : but whether formerly an appendage of Home Castle, or not, is now unknown.

Free-stone, of an excellent quality, is abundant ; and there is also coal, and lime-stone, but of a hard kind. A Fair is holden in the Village of Houston in the month of July, called Peter's Day. The Barony of Houston, which anciently belonged to the family of de Padvinan, comprehends the whole Parish of Hous- ton, and a small part of Kill-Allan : It afterwards passed by sale through the families of Shaw, Campbell, and Macrae, and is now the property of Archi- bald Speirs, Esq., of Elderslie, who has an elegant Mansion here, surrounded with extensive natural woods, and plantations. The estate of Fullwood, formerly the property ofthe Porterfields, of Fullwood, Cadets ofthe Porterfields, of Duchal, now belongs to Mr. Speirs, who demolished the Mansion aster he had purchased the estate, and entailed it. The Mansion-House of Bar ochan, the Seat of the very ancient and much respected family of Fleming, is also sur rounded with natural woods, and extensive plantations ; and near it, is a large moss of several hundred acres, from which the neighbouring districts procure peats : the ancient Cross, which stood in the Barony, by the side of the public road, has lately been removed to an adjacent hill. Boghall, a small Barony on the North side of the Parish, was once the Seat of another family of the name of Fleming, and is now the property of Boyd Alexander, Esq., of South Barr. Here are several cairns, in which Urns, containing human bones and ashes, have been discovered. The Fair is holden on the second Tuesday in May. HOW, v. SHAPINSAY, ISLAND.

It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 372, and, in 1811, was 373. It is 11 m. S. from Kelso. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and about 6 miles in breadth. It borders on the East with the County of Northumberland, where the top ofthe Fells, a range ofthe Cheviot Hills, is the march. It may be called a hilly, or mountainous District, but the pasture is excellent ; and it is famous for a particular breed of"], [47, "HOY Sheep, called The Kail-water Breed, from a river of that name which flows through the middle ofthe Parish. The air is healthy, and the inhabitants enjoy a considerable degree of the comforts of life, are chearful and contented, and but few of them are poor. The Roman Road from Borough- bridge in Yorkshire, runs through part of this Parish ; it afterwards passes by St. Boswell's Green, where the Fair is holden, and then bends its course towards the Lothians. On the summit of Hownam Laic, one of the highest ofthe Border hills, are the re mains ofa rectangular Encampment: it was of great extent, and, within these few years a large iron Gate, which was taken down from the top of the Law, was to be seen at Cessford Castle, belonging to The Duke of Roxburgh. There are smaller encampments on the summits of the other Hills in the neigh bourhood, which have either been made by the Romans when they invaded Scotland, or formed in the course ofthe many and destructive wars in which the Borderers were anciently involved. The principal disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the scarcity of fuel. See, Moll. HOW o/HOXA, v. RONALDSAY, SOUTH. HOW-QUOY HEAD, v. HOLM. HOWTON, v. ORPHIR.

It is in the Presbytery of Cairston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 244, and, in 1811, was 282. It is 2\\ m. S. from Stromness. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and about 6 in breadth. Almost the whole of it is occupied by three large hills, ranged in the form ofa triangle, of which that to the North-East, called Hie Wart Hill, is the largest, rising from a plain, with a broad base, to the height of 1600 feet above the level of the sea. Except along the North shores, which are bordered with a loamy soil and a rich verdure, the soil is composed of peat, and clay ; of which the former commonly predomi- nates, black, wet, and spongy: and this seemingly from the great quantity of rain that falls here. The ground destined for the production of grain, and that appropriated for feeding cattle, bear but a very small proportion to what is covered with heath, and allotted for sheep pasture; and nearly 2000 of these defenceless animals roam at large through this extensive tract, a prey to dogs, eagles, and other birds ofthe same destructive nature. The climate is healthy. vol, h. F"], [48, "HUD The great disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the scarcity of fuel. There are few monuments of antiquity in this Island: Tlie Dwarfie Stone, of which so many ridiculous tales have been so often told, has perhaps no just claim to be ranked in that number. This Stone, which lies in the South-East of the Wart Hill, on the brink of a Valley, is a sand or free-stone of the same nature with those on the rock above it, from which it seems to have been broken off, either by the hand of man or its own gravity, and tumbled to its present site, where it has been afterwards hollowed out, into the whimsical form which it now bears. Its greatest length is 32 feet, its breadth 17, its thickness above the surface of the earth not less than 7\\ feet ; and the inside of it is divided into three apartments, in one of which is something like a bed, 5 f . 8 in. long, by 2 feet broad ; the other is a sort of small room : and between them, there is a space that seems to have been intended for a fire-place, as there is a hole cut in the roof, or upper part ofthe stone, for the smoke perhaps to ascend through : to give it still more the resemblance ofa dwelling, a stone ofthe same nature, and nearly ofthe same shape, has been rolled down, and placed in such a position as to serve the purpose of a door. Tradition, and some credulous Authors, affirm it to have been the habitation of a Giant, and his Consort, from which they occa sionally issued forth for depredation : in all probability, it has been the Cell of some Hermit. The Township of Rackwick is beautifully situate in the extre mity ofa valley to which it gives name, being closed in on two sides by very lofty precipices of sand-stone, but opening with a sine Bay towards the Western entrance ofthe Pentland Firth, so that every vessel which passes the Firth must necessarily come into view : the inaccessible crags here, are the habitation of the Em and the black Eagle, which reign with \" savage majesty,\" amono- the desolate cliffs, and noiseless vallies of Hoy. The people here are very poor ; \" we entered,\" says Mr. Neill, \" what promised to be one ofthe best cottages in Rackwick; but still it appeared to us miserable in the extreme.\" \u2014 Hoy is the most interesting district of Orkney, either to the Botanist or the Ornithologist : and well deserves the attention of any Naturalist who may have an opportunity, leisurely to examine it, at different seasons of the'year. Its shores rise, in many places, to a most terrific height. It is remarkable for its excellent Harbour, called The Long Hope, where great fleets can rendezvous, and in complete safety. This Island is entirely composed of sand-stone, sand-stone flag, shistose clay, and, in many parts, a rock of wacken. HUD'S-HOUSE, v. CASTLE-TOWN."], [49, "II U M HULMITRAY, ISLE, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Harris, and is situate in the Sound It is uninhabited. HUMBIE, in the Shire of Hadington : an ancient District, comprehending the two Rectories of Keith- Hundeby, and Keith- 3f ar shall, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the glebe is a poor one. According to Mr. Chalmers, Keith appears to have been the ancient name of the whole District, which is intersected by a small river, that runs in a narrow bottom between steep banks. From David the First, Hervei, the son of Warin, obtained a grant of the North- West half of this District, which was called from him Keith Hervey; and which was afterward called, Keith- Marshall : From the same King, Symon Fraser acquired a grant of the South-East half of the same District, which was deno minated from him, Keith- Symon , and which was afterward called, Keith- Hundeby. As the Church stood within the district of Keith-Symon, Hervei erected a Chapel in his own manor of Keith- Hervey, for the accommodation of his tenants ; and, according to the established custom, settled a yearly tribute to the Mother Church. Symon Fraser granted to the Monks of Kelso the Church of Keith, with its pertinents, and other privileges. During the reign of Alex ander the Second, the Manor of Keiih-Hervey was made a distinct Parish, with its Chapel, that was thenceforth to be independant ofthe Church of Keith- Symon, which was at length distinguished by the name of Keith- Hundeby, from a Hamlet called Hundeby near the Church. The Patronage of the Church of Keith- Marshall belonged to the descendants of Sir Robert Keith, by the grant of Robert Bruce, till their whole property here was sold by William, Earl Marshal, during the perturbations of the reign of Charles the First. After the Reformation, the ancient Parishes of Keith- Hundeby, and Keith-Marshall, were conjoined ; and the United Parish has since been known by the name of Hurnbie, the Patronage of which belongs, jointly, to The King and The Earl of Hopetoun. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 785, and, in 1811, was 837. It is 8 m. S. S. W. from Hadington. This Parish forms nearly a square of six miles : the surface is uneven, and the high grounds are well adapted for sheep pasture : in the low grounds, the soil is various, and is in general cultivated with great attention and ability : Humbie Wood consists of about 300 acres of Oak, and Birch. Only three Farms in this Parish are subjected, by their leases, to pay kain-fowls: the Tenants, when treating for their farms, having insisted for an exemption from thirlage, carriages, and kain, and made a fair Ff2"], [50, "HUN allowance. The roads are good. The climate is very healthy. There tis abundance of iron-ore, and many places indicate the existence of coal. A mineral Spring here was formerly much resorted to, for scorbutic disorders. On the South-West border ofthe Parish are the distinct vestiges ofa Roman mili tary Station, many of the stones whereof have been lately carried away to build the Mansion-House of Whiteburgh, and some Farm-houses upon the Estate : near it were several Tumuli, in which Urns full of bones and ashes have been discovered ; and in the Camp itself, a gold Coin of the Emperor Trajan, and other antiquities, were discovered. Here are two Schools, with the legal Salary of 300 merks, and perquisites, to each. It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. See, Keith. HUME, v. HOME. HUME-BYRES, v.

The extensive property of the Bishoprick of Glasgow, in the Shire of Roxburgh, was included within the Regality of Glasgow. Huntlaw, and a part of the lands of Moll, and of Hassendean, which were the property of the Monks of Paisley, were all included in the Regality of Paisley. HUNTLEY, and HUNTLEY-WOOD, v. GORDON."], [51, "HUT HUNTLEY, in the District of Strath-Bogie, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Rectory, consisting of the two distinct Parishes of Dumbenan, and Kinore, which were both served by one Minister, and are now united ; the Stipend whereof, in 1811, was 3 chalders of oat-meal, at 8 stone perboW, 1000 merks Scotch in money, and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : no manse: the glebe consists of 10 acres, at an inconvenient distance : Patron, The Duke of Gordon : The Church is too small for the Congregation. It is in the Presbytery of Strath-Bogie, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2863, and, in 1811, was 2764. It is 140 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday, O. S. in July, the second Tuesday, O. S., in September, and the first Tuesday, O. S., in December. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on a [\"point of land formed by the confluence of the river Bogie with the Deveron, and is a neat, and healthy Town. A considerable manufacture of linen cloth is carried on here. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. The extremity of that part of the Parish, called Kinore, is 3 computed miles distant from the Town of Huntley, over very rough and rocky ground ; and to the extremity ofthe other, called Dumbenan, it is also 3 computed miles, over an equally rough and rocky surface : there are, however, many acres of fine arable land ; and most of the hills and eminences are covered with thriving plantations. Both the Deveron, and the Bogie, afford excellent trout ; and over each of them is a good stone bridge. The Duke of Gordon is Proprietor of the whole Parish, except a haugh of land in the North end of Kinore, which belongs to Mr. G ordon, of Avochy. Near to the bridge of Deveron, stand the remains of Huntley Castle, which still afford a magnificent proof of the grandeur and hospitality of that ancient family. Upon the banks of the Deveron is Huntley Lodge, the elegant residence of The Marquis of Huntley. See, Gordon. HURLY HAUKIN, v. LIFF. HUTTON, in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. Sterling, and a glebe : the manse is in good repair: Patron, The Crown : The Church was rebuilt in 1765, and is neat, and commo dious. It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 955, and, in 1811, was 1030. It is 6 m. W. b. N. from Berwick upon Tweed. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. Its general appearance is level, with"], [52, "II UT a deep loamy soil on the banks ofthe rivers, and with a more shallow loam in the rest ofthe Parish. It is bounded on the South by the river Tweed, and on the North by the small river Whittadder, both of which produce excellent salmon, and trout. Ten boats, or cobbles, are the highest number allowed to be kept on this side the river Tweed, in this Parish. The air is sometimes moist, but generally dry, and the Inhabitants are remarkably healthy. The tide flows to Norham Castle, which is 10 miles from Berwick : and a boat of 30 Tons can navigate the river to New Water-Ford, a distance of 6 miles from that town. Here is abundance of excellent free-stone. The roads are good. The Rev. Philip Redpath, a Gentleman of great worth and learning, and well known for his translation of Boethius, was formerly Minister here. The present Parish of Hutton consists of the old Parishes of Fishwick, and Hutton, which were united about the time ofthe Reformation. It also comprises the village of Paxton. HUTTON, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parish ofCorrie united, soon after the Reformation: the Stipend of which, including the allowance for Communion elements, is 1300 merks : the manse was built in 1755 : the glebe is extensive: Patron, The Earl of Hopetoun : The Church was built in 1764. It is in the Presbytery of Loch-Maben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1801, was 646, and, in 1811, was 677. It is 7 m. N. from Lockerby. This Parish contains between 18,000 and 19,000 acres of land : it is watered by the rivers Milk, Dryfe, and Corrie ; near the latter of which, are many fertile fields and meadows ; while the other rivers run through a wild and mountainous tract, covered with heath, and interspersed with moss. The whole ofthe Parishes of Hutton and Corrie belong in Superiority to The Earl of Hopetoun, as heir ofthe family of Annandale, and nearly four-fifths of them are His Lordship's property ; there are six other Heritors. The number of sheep kept here is about 12,000. The Heritors of Hutton give a voluntary Salary of \u00a38. .6.. 8. to a Schoolmaster ; and their School has been generally well supplied. The climate is healthy. Game is abundant ; and at Shaw, on the river Dryfe, is an extensive Heronry. The Grahams, of Gillesbie, had their residence at a place called Maskersa, of which there are some remains on the Farm of Closs : but they removed from thence, upwards of 300 years ago, to a Tower on the brink ofthe Dryfe, which, by the thickness of the walls and the fosse, appears to have been of great - \u2022 nglh: the descendants of this respectable family still retain property in the"], [53, "I c o rieighbourhood. It was in the Tower of Gillesbie, that The President of the Court of Session (soon after its institution) was confined, when taken away to prevent his giving a second decision in a Suit, in which one of the parties thought the President had too much influence. There are several remains of old entrenchments, ofa circular form, called British forts, and a rectangular one at Carter- Town, which was a small Roman camp ; and probably served as a post of communication between Annandale, and Eskdale, where the Romans had several Stations. The chief Proprietor of these Parishes has annihilated the thirlage of his tenants in every degree, and by other judicious indulgences has greatly improved the estate. HUTTON, LITTLE, v.

V CHAMUIS, CASTLE, v. SLEAT. I-COLM-KILL, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : It constitutes part ofthe Parish ofKillfinichen. It is situate to the Westward ofthe Isle of Mull, from which it is separated by a narrow channel, called The Sound of /. This Island is about three measured miles in length, and from half a mile to a mile in breadth. On the East side, it is flat ; in the middle, it rises into small hills ; and, on the West side, it is rugged and rocky : the whole forming a singular mixture of rocks, and fertile ground. The Resi dent Population ofthe Village, in 1798, was 336: it is situate near a small Bay, called The Bay of Martyrs, where the Illustrious dead were landed for inter ment. It furnishes many valuable minerals, particularly a beautiful yellow serpentine ; and the greater part of the Island lies upon marble, which, in some places, is richly variegated. The venerable Bede calls it Hii, in his history, but the proper name is /, sounded like ee in English : I in Gaelic signifies an Island, and, this, by way of eminence, is called The Island. By Monkish writers"], [54, "I c o it has been named Jona, -which, if derived from the Gaelic, signifies Tlie Island of Waves, very characteristic of it iu times of storm. Others think that Iona is derived from a Hebrew word, signifying \" a Dove,\" in allusion to St. Columba, the founder of its Monastery and its fame. The name of Iona is now quite lost in the country, and it is always called /, except when the speaker wishes to lay an emphasis upon the word, when it is termed I- Columb- Kill, i. e. Hie Isle of the Cell of Columba. Near the Island is a small Isle, called Nun's Island, per haps from an ancient Convent ; where, it is said, the stone was dug which was used in the buildings of I-Colm-Kill. The Religious Edifices, of which the ruins now only remain, were established by St. Columba, about the year 565, who left Ireland, his native country, with the intention of preaching Christianity to the Picts. He landed at /, which was at that time called Inish Druinish, i. e. The Island ofthe Druids: and having converted the Pictish Monarch, received the property of the Island, where he founded a Cell for Canons Regular ; who, 'till the year 716, differed from those ofthe Church of Rome, both in the obser vance of Easter, and in the Clerical tonsure. In 807, the monks were dislodged by the Danes, and the Monastery became depopulated for many years ; but, on the retreat ofthe Danes, it received a new Order, being then peopled by Clu niacs, who continued there 'till the dissolution of Monastic establishments, when the revenues were united to the See of Argyle : and, on the abolition of Episco pacy, the Island became the property of The Duke of Argyle. The ruins are much dilapidated; but the generous care ofthe Noble and benevolent family of Argyle has raised a strong wall round the chief parts ofthe building, to secure it as much as possible from future injury. The Cathedral is 38 yards in lengths and 8 in breadth ; and the length of the transept is 24 yards. The East window is a beautiful specimen of Gothick workmanship ; the pillars are all in different styles of architecture, but their capitals are ornamented with scripture pieces, of the most grotesque figures. \" We were now treading that Illustrious Island,\" says Dr. Johnson, in his solemn and impressive style, \" which was once the Luminary ofthe Caledonian regions, whence savage Clans and roving Barba rians derived the benefits of knowledge, and the blessings of religion. To ab stract the mind from all local emotion would be impossible, if it were endeavoured, and would be foolish, if it were possible. Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses ; whatever makes the past, the distant, or the future predo-. minate over the present, advances us in the dignity of thinking beings. Far from me and from my friends be such frigid philosophy, as may conduct us"], [55, "I c o indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by wisdom, bravery, or virtue. That man is little to be envied, whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona. We came too late to visit monuments : some care was necessary for ourselves. Whatever was in the island, Sir Allan could demand, for the inhabitants were Macleans ; but having little, they could not give us much. \u2014 In the morning we rose and surveyed the place. The Churches ofthe two Convents are both standing, though unroofed. They were built of unhewn stone, but solid, and not inelegant. I brought away rude measures ofthe build ings, such as I cannot much trust myself, inaccurately taken, and obscurely noted. Mr. Pennant's delineations, which are doubtless exact, have made my unskilful description less necessary. The Episcopal church consists of two parts, sepa rated by the belfry, and built at different times. The original church had, like others, the altar at one end, and tower at the other ; but, as it grew too small, another building of equal dimension was added, and the tower then was neces sarily in the middle. That these edifices are of different ages seems evident. The arch of the first church is Roman, being part of a circle ; that of the additional building is pointed, and therefore Gothic or Saraccnical; the tower is firm, and wants only to be floored and covered. Of the chambers or cells belonging to the monks, there are some walls remaining, but nothing approaching to a complete apartment. The bottom of the Church is so encumbered with mud and rubbish, that we could make no discoveries of curious inscriptions, and what there are have been already published. The place is said to be known where The Black Stones lie concealed, on which the old Highland Chiefs, when they made contracts and alliances, used to take the oath, which was considered as more sacred than any other obligation, and which could not be violated without the blackest infamy. In those days of vio lence and rapine, it was of great importance to impress upon savage minds the sanctity of an oath, by some particular and extraordinary circumstances. They would not have recourse to The Black Stones, upon small or common occasions, and when they had established their faith by this tremendous sanction, incon stancy and treachery were no longer feared. The Chapel of the Nunnery is now used by the inhabitants as a kind of general Cow-house, and the bottom is con sequently too miry for examination. Some ofthe stones which covered the later Abbesses have inscriptions, which might yet be read, if the chapel were cleansed. The roof of this, as of all the other buildings, is totally destroyed, not only VOL. II. G"], [56, "I c o cause timber quickly decays when it is neglected, but because in an Island utterly destitute of wood, it was wanted for use, and was consequently the first plunder of needy rapacity. The chancel ofthe Nuns' Chapel is covered with an arch of stone, to which time has done no injury ; and a small apartment communicating with the choir, on the North side, like the Chapter-House in Cathedrals, roofed with stone in the same manner, is likewise entire. In one ofthe Churches was a marble Altar, which the superstition of the inhabitants has destroyed. Their opinion was, that a fragment of this stone was a defence against shipr wrecks, fire, and miscarriages. In one corner ofthe church, the bason for holy water is yet unbroken. The Cemetery of the Nunnery was, till very lately, re garded with such reverence, that only icomen were buried in it. These reliques of veneration always produce some mournful pleasure. I could have forgiven a great injury more easily than the violation of this imaginary Sanctity. South of the Chapel stand the walls ofa large room, which was probably the hall, or re fectory ofthe Nunnery. This apartment is capable of repair. Ofthe rest ofthe Convent there are only fragments. Besides the two principal churches, there are, I think, five chapels yet standing, and three more remembered. There are also Crosses, of which two bear the names of St. John, and St. Matthew. A large space of ground about these consecrated edifices is covered with grave-stones, few of which have any inscription. He that surveys it, attended by an Insular antiquary, may be told where the Kings of many nations are buried, and if he loves to sooth his imagination with the thoughts that naturally rise in places where the great and the powerful lie mingled with the dust, let him listen in submissive silence ; for, if he asks any questions, his delight is at an end. Iona has long enjoyed, without any very credible attestation, the honour of being re puted the Cemetery of the Scottish Kings. It is not unlikely, that, when the opinion of local sanctity was prevalent, the Chieftains of the Isles, and perhaps some of the Norwegian or Irish princes, were reposited in this venerable inclo sure. But by whom the subterraneous vaults are peopled, is now utterly un known. The graves are very numerous, and some of them undoubtedly contain the remains of men, who did not expect to be so soon forgotten. Not far from this awful ground may be traced the garden of the Monastery : the fish-ponds are yet discernible, and the aqueduct which supplied them is still in use. There remains a broken building, which is called The Bishop's House, I know not by what authority. It was once the residence of some man above the common rank, for it has two stories and a chimney. We were shewn a chimney at the other"], [57, "I c o end, which was only a niche, without perforation, but so much does Antiquarian credulity, or patriotic vanity prevail, that it was not much more safe to trust the eye of our instructor than the memory. There is in the Island one house more, and only one, that has a chimney; we entered it, and found it neither wanting repair nor inhabitants ; but to the farmers, who now possess it, the chimney is of no great value ; for their fire was made on the floor, in the middle ofthe room, and notwithstanding the dignity of their mansion, they rejoiced, like their neigh bours, in the comforts of smoke. It is observed, that Ecclesiastical Colleges are always in the most pleasant and fruitful places. While the world allowed the Monks their choice, it is surely no dishonour that they chose well. This Island is remarkably fruitful. The Village near the Churches is said to contain seventy families, which, at five in a family, is more than a hundred inhabitants to a mile. There are perhaps other Villages ; yet both corn and cattle are annually ex ported. But the fruitfulness of Iona is now its whole prosperity. The inhab itants are remarkably gross, and remarkably neglected : I know not if they are visited by any Minister (only once a quarter). The Island, which was once the Metropolis of Learning and Piety, has now no School for education, nor Temple for Worship, only two inhabitants that can speak English, and not one that can write or read. (A School has since been established by the Society for propa gating Christian Knowledge, the Salary and perquisites of which amount to about \u00a320. per annum.) \u2014 The people are ofthe Clan of Maclean ; and though Sir Allan had not been in the place for many years, he was received with all the reverence due to their Chieftain. One of them being sharply reprehended by him, for not sending him some rum, declared after his departure, in Mr. Boswell's presence, that he had no design of disappointing him, for, said he, I icould eut my bones for him; and if he had sent his dog for it, he should have had it. When we were to depart, our boat was left by the ebb at a great dis tance from the water, but .no sooner did we wish it afloat, than the Islanders gathered round it, and, by the union of many hands, pushed it down the beach; every man who could contribute his help seemed to think himself happy in the opportunity of being, for a moment, useful to his Chief. We now left those Illustrious ruins, by which Mr. Boswell was much affected, nor would I wil lingly be thought to have looked upon them without some emotion. Perhaps, in the revolutions ofthe world, Iona may be sometime again the Instructress of the Western regions.\" \u2014 There is an ancient Gaelic Prophecy, which has been thus translated by Dr. Smith, of Campbell- Town : G 2"], [58, "I N C \" Seven years before that awful day, When time shall be no more, A watery deluge will o'ersweep Hibernia's mossy shore ; The green-clad Isla, too, shall sink, While, with the great and good, Columba's happy isle will rear Her towers above the flood.\" Two or three boats are employed in the Fisheries.

It is 3 miles long, and half a mile broad in most places. The soil is partly sandy, and partly black ground, yielding tolerable crops of barley, and pasture for cattle. IMACHAR, v. KILL-MORY. INCH, in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Com munion elements, and a glebe: The manse was built in 1771: Patron, Sir William Forbes, Bart., of Craigievar : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 798, and, in 1811, was 927. It is 2| m. W. from Old Rayne. It is pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of a rivulet, and is a Burgh of Barony, with a weekly Market, and three annual Fairs ; but they are much on the decline. It is 26 miles from Aberdeen, from whence it has been proposed to carry a Canal to this Village ; a work which, if executed, would be attended with important advantages to the fertile district of Garioch, anciently called The Granary of Aberdeen. The feuars of the Village are Heritable Proprietors of their houses, and small gardens : they are either Shop keepers, or mechanics ; and rent small farms from Colonel Hay, of Rannes, who is Superior ofthe Town, and Proprietor of the lands in the neighbourhood. This Parish contains nearly 7500 Scotch acres ; of which, about 2500 are under cultivation. Towards the South, the soil is for the most part excellent, and"], [59, "I N \u20ac produces rich and early crops : but, on the North, along the skirts of the Hill of Fondland, it is less fertile, and the crops are late and precarious. The Hill of Fondland, which extends into several Parishes, is elevated about 800 feet above the level ofthe sea : and in the highest part of it, within this Parish, are extensive Quarries of fine blue slate : it would seem to have been formerly a very considerable Hunting Forest, as its name in the Gaelic language implies ; and very large trees are frequently dug up in the mosses : it now abounds in moss, heath, and moor game. About half a mile from the Village, is the curious and noted hill of Dun-o-Deer, or Dundore, i. e. The Hill in the Wood, which af fords excellent pasture for sheep, though it does not now render their teeth of a golden colour, as the credulous Boethius affirms that it formerly did : the base of this Hill is about 3000 yards in circumference, and rises insulated from the level plain ofthe Garioch, to the elevation of 300 feet: upon its summit are the ruias of an ancient Castle, which is said to have been built by King Gre gory the Great: a considerable part ofthe walls are still standing, and the materials with which they are constructed, are of a singular kind, being by some persons supposed to be part ofa vitrified Fort ; while others assert them to be volcanic, dug out ofthe hill itself: a particular description ofthe Hill and Castle of Dun-o-Deer, are given in the Sixth volume of Arch\u00e6ologia, p. 88, and in the Periodical paper, called The Bee; both of which are accompanied with engravings. INCH, in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Rectory of Kingussie : The Church being dedicated to St. Ewan. It is 10*\u00a7* m. N. E. from Pitmain. This Parish is situate on the East side of the river Spey, which here flows though a Lake, called Loch Inch, about a mile and a half in length, and nearly the same in breadth ; when the river swells, a branch of it runs on each side ofa small hill on which the Church stands, thereby making it an Island ; and hence the name of Inch. It is nearly three miles square, and is watered by the rivers Feshie, and Tromie, which descend from the Grampian Hills. Here is a Ferry over the Spey. See, Kingussie. INCH, in the District of The Rhyns, and Shire of Wigtown : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 48 bolls of meal, 16 bolls of bear, Linliffigow measure, and \u00a345. in money : there is a question depending in the locality of the Parish of Inch, as to the Teinds payable out of Garthland to Stranraer : the manse is called Soul Seat, Sedes animarum, and is almost sur rounded by a Lake, nearly similar in form to a horse shoe : the glebe consists of"], [60, "I N C more than the legal extent : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in decent con- dition. It is in the Presbytery of Stranraer, and Synod of Galloway. The Resi- dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of The Cairn) was 1577, and, in 1811, was 1831. It is 2\\ m. E. from Stranraer. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and, in some parts, the same in breadth, occupying a great portion of the Isthmus which is formed by the approximation of the Bays of Luce, and Ryan : the Southern part is flat, and sandy ; but, towTards the East and North-East, a beautiful range of hills extend the whole length ofthe Parish ; the sides of these are partly green pasture, and partly arable ; and their summits for some miles, are covered with heath, as far as the water of Luce, which forms the Eastern boundary : except the sandy plain to the South, the soil is a good loam, and very productive : and by the influence and example of the late Earl of Stair, great improvements in agriculture have been made here. This Parish is remarkable for its fresh water Lakes ; they are fifteen in number, of different dimensions, and abound in pike, perch, carp, tench, and trout, both white and red ; and are also frequented by prodigious numbers of aquatic birds of various kinds. The two Lakes of Castle Kennedy lie parallel to each other ; the one being a mile, and the other a mile and a half in length, and both in some parts half a mile broad : there is a small Island in each, and upon one of them, which is about 600 yards in circumference, are the vestiges ofa Religious edifice. The Ruins of Castle Kennedy show it to have been a strong and massy building ; it was burned by accident in 1715, nor has it ever since been re-built: it was anciently the Seat ofthe Family of Cassil, from one of whom it was pur chased by the first Earl of Stair. Mr. Grosc has preserved a view of it. The climate is mild, and healthy. Here is a Sulphureous spring, which is used with efficacy in stomachic and scorbutic complaints. The Inch is exceedingly well supplied with peats. It is subject to the Jurisdiction of the Custom-house of Stranraer. INCH BRAYOCK, off the Coast of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Craig. This is a small Island of 34 Scotch acres, situate in the river South Esk. It has lately become of great importance from its two Bridges, on the turn-pike road from Aber-Brothock to Montrose, which passes across this Isle. One Bridge of stone communicates with the Parish of Craig ; and another of wood with a draw-bridge, connects the Island with Montrose. A spacious street has been planned, and a few houses erected ; and a company are forming a large and con venient dry Dock, for building and repairing of Ships. It originally gave name to"], [61, "I N C the Parish of Craig, and the principal Burying-ground is still upon this Island. Its name implies, The Island of Trouts ; and even at this time, two-thirds of the Fishing ground, around the Island, go by the name of The Trout-shot. INCH C AILLOCH, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire of Stirling : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Buchanan. Here the Church was situate till the year 1621, when a considerable part of the Parish of Luss, at that time on this side of the Loch, was annexed to the Parish of Inch Cailloch. Some years after the annexation, the walls ofthe Church of Inch Cailloch going to decay, and the inhabitants likewise finding it inconvenient every Sabbath, especially in stormy weather, to be crossing over to the Island, Divine Worship w-as per formed in a Church near the House of Buchanan, which was originally a Chapel of Ease belonging to the Parish of Luss. From this Chapel, which was called The Church or Chapel of Buchanan, the whole United Parish came by degrees to be called The Parish of Buchanan. Its name implies, The Island of the old Women, and was so called, from the circumstance of there having been for merly a Nunnery here. This Island is about a mile in length, is elevated, and has some fine wood upon it. It is inhabited, and produces good wheat, and oats. It is the property of The Duke of Montrose. INCH-COLM, off the Coast of Fife. This is a small Island, in the Firth of Forth, about a mile from the Village of Aberdour, to which Parish it is annexed. Upon it, are the remains ofa celebrated Monastery of Canons Regular of St. Augustine, founded in 1123 by Alexander the First, in consequence of avow, and dedicated to St. Columba. It was richly endowed by the mun ificence of that Prince ; and, so famous was the place for its sanctity, that Alan de Mor timer, Lord of Aberdour, bestowed half of the lands of Aberdour on the Monks ofthe Island, for the privilege of a family burial-place in their Church. Its wealth, in the time of Edward the Third, proved so strong a temptation to his fleet, then lying in the Forth, as to suppress all the horror of sacrilege, and re spect to the sanctity of the inhabitants. It continued a place of consequence, until the Reformation completed the ruin of those Religious Houses ; and is now the property of The Earl of Moray, who has also the title of Lord of St. Colm. There is now a small Fort upon the Island, erected at the expense of Govern ment, for the protection of the Firth. INCH CONAGAN, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire of Dumbarton : it constitutes part of the Parish of Luss. This Island is above half a mile long, and about two furlongs and a half broad, and contains 94 acres, which are all under a natural Oak and Fir wood."], [62, "I N C INCH CRUIN, i. e. THE ROUND ISLAND, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire of Stirling : it constitutes part of the Parish of Buchanan. It is in habited, and affords some good arable and pasture ground. It is the property of The Duke of Montrose. This Island is about three quarters of a mile in length, and has but little wood : it is an Asylum for insane persons. 1NCH-DAIRNIE, v. KINGLASSIE. INCH-DRUAR, v. BANFF. INCH-EFFRAY, v. MADDERTY. INCH FAEL, i. e. THE LONG ISLAND, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire of Stirling : it constitutes part of the Parish of Buchanan. It is inhab ited, and possesses some good arable and pasture ground. It is the property of The Duke of Montrose. INCH-GAR VIE, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Inver-Keithing. This is a small Island, situate nearly in the middle of the passage over the Forth, at Queen's Ferry. It was anciently fortified ; and, on the alarm occasioned by the appearance of Paul Jones and his squadron in the Firth, in 1779, its fortifications were repaired, and 4 iron 24 pounders mounted upon them, and furnished with 100 rounds of ammunition to each : one or two Artillerymen reside on the Island, to take care ofthe stores. The pros pect from hence is particularly beautiful. INCH-INNAN, in the Shire of Renfrew : formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Knights' Templars; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 8 chalders of meal, and \u00a320. Sterling : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of 8 acres : Patron, Archibald Campbell, Esq. , of Blythswood : The Church is very ancient. It is in the Presbytery of Paisley, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 462, and, in 1811, was 641. It is 1-l m. W. b. N. from Renfrew. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 1^ mile in breadth. The soil is in general fertile ; especially on the banks ofthe rivers White Cart, Gryfe, and Clyde, which, in Autumn, are liable to sudden inundations : it is all inclosed, and agriculture has lately been much attended to. The great road, from Glasgow to Greenock, passes through the Parish, crossing the united streams of the Gryfe and White Cart, by a bridge of 10 arches, which was thrown down some years ago by an excessive flood, and is now rebuilt in a most substantial and elegant manner, a little way above the site of the former one. The ancient Castle of Inch-Innan, which stood near the banks ofthe Clyde, and was one ofthe seats of the Dukes of Lennox, is now"], [63, "I N C completely demolished. North Barr, once a seat of Lord Semple, is a fine old building. MMtiatMmi INCH-KEITH, off the Coast of Fife ; and in the Parish of Kinghorn. This is a small rocky Island, situate nearly in the middle ofthe Firth of Forth, and is about a mile in length. It is said to derive its name from the gallant Keith, who, in 1010, so greatly signalized himself at the battle of Barry, in Angus, against the Danes : after which he received in reward the Barony of Keith, in East Lothian, and this little Isle. It was taken possession of, and fortified by the English in the reign of Edward the Sixth, in 1549, but they were obliged to evacuate it, after a very gallant defence. The fort was kept in repair by the Scots for some time, but was destroyed by Act of Parliament, to prevent its being of use to their enemies. There is a spring of fine water on the summit ofthe rock. In 1497, by an Order of the Privy Council to the Magistrates of Edin burgh, it was used as a place of banishment, for all persons infected with the Venereal disease, then called the Grangore. The French gave it the name of L'isle des chevaux, from its property of soon fattening horses. It was visited by Dr. Johnson, in 1773, who describes it as \" nothing more than a rock covered with a thin layer of earth, not wholly bare of grass, and very fertile of thistles. A small herd of cows grazes annually upon it, in the summer. It seems never to have afforded to man or beast a permanent habitation.\" It is now occupied as pasturage, for the particular breeds of sheep imported into Scotland by the British Wool Society. Of late years, The Duke of Buccleugh discovered that his family had the right of property to this Isle. An excellent Light-House has recently been erected here. ? INCH KENNETH, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Killfinichen. It is situate at the entrance of Loch-na- Kell, off the Western coast of Mull, and at the distance of 12 m. S W. b. W. from Aros. This Island, says Dr. Johnson, in his beautiful and emphatic description, is \" about a mile long, and perhaps half a mile broad, remarkable for pleasantness and fertility. It is verdant and grassy, and fit both for pasture and tillage ; but it has no trees. Its only inhab itants were Sir Allan Maclean and two young Ladies, his daughters, with their servants. Romance does not often exhibit a scene that strikes the imagin ation more than this little desert in these depths of Western obscurity, occupied not by a gross herdsman, or amphibious fisherman, but by a gentleman and two ladies, of high birth, polished manners, and elegant conversation, who, in a VOL. II. H"], [64, "I N C habitation raised not very far above the ground, but furnished with unexpected neatness and convenience, practised all the kindness of hospitality, and refine- ment of courtesy. Sir Allan is the Chieftain ofthe great Clan of Maclean, which is said to claim the second place among the Highland Families, yielding only to Macdonald. Though by the misconduct of his ancestors, most of the extensive territory, which would have descended to him, has been alienated, he still retains much of the dignity and authority of his birth. When soldiers were lately wanting for the American war, application was made to Sir Allan, and he nominated a hundred men for the service, who obeyed the summons, and bore arms under his command. He had then, for some time, resided with the young- Ladies in Inch Kenneth, where he lives not only with plenty, but with elegance, having conveyed to his cottage a collection of books, and what else is necessary to make his hours pleasant. When we landed, we were met by Sir Allan and the Ladies, accompanied by Miss Macquarry, who had passed some time with them, and now returned to Ulva with her father, WTe all walked together to the mansion, where we found one cottage for Sir Allan, and I think two more for the domesticks and the offices. We entered, and wanted little that Palaces afford. Our room was neatly floored, and well lighted ; and our dinner, which was dressed in one ofthe other huts, was plentiful and delicate. In the after- noon Sir Allan reminded us, that the day was Sunday, which he never suffered to pass without some Religious distinction, and invited us to partake in his acts of domestick Worship ; which I hope neither Mr. Boswell nor myself will be suspected of a disposition to refuse. The elder of the Ladies read the English service. Inch Kenneth was once a Seminary of Ecclesiastics, subordinate, I suppose, to 1-Colm-Kill. Sir Allan had a mind to trace the foundation ofthe College, but neither I nor Mr. Boswell, who bends a keener eye on vacancy, were able to perceive them. Our attention, however, was sufficiently eno-ao-ed by a venerable Chapel, which stands yet entire, except that the roof is gone. It is about 60 feet in length, and 30 in breadth : on one side ofthe Altar is a bas relief of the Blessed Virgin, and by it lies a little bell; which, though cracked, and without a clapper, has remained there for ages, guarded only by the vener ableness of the place. The ground round the Chapel is covered with grave stones of Chiefs and Ladies ; and still continues to be a place of sepulture Inch Kenneth is a proper prelude to I-Colm-Kill. It was not without some mournful emotion that we contemplated the ruins of Religious structures and the monuments ofthe dead. On the next day, we took a more distinct view of"], [65, "I N C the place, and went with the boat to see oysters in the bed, out of which the boat-men forced up as many as were wanted. Even Inch Kenneth has a subor dinate Island, named Sandiland, I suppose in contempt, where we landed, and found a rock, with a surface of perhaps four acres, of which one is naked stone, another spread with sand and shells, some of which I picked up for their glossy beauty, and two covered with a little earth and grass, on which Sir Allan has a few sheep. I doubt not but when there was a College at Inch Kenneth, there was a Hermitage upon Sandiland. Having wandered over those extensive plains, we committed ourselves again to the winds and waters ; and after a voyage of about ten minutes, in which we met with nothing very observable, were again safe upon dry ground. We told Sir Allan our desire of visiting I-Colm-Kill, and entreated him to give us his protection, and his company. He thought proper to hesitate a little : but the Ladies hinted, that as they knew he would not finally refuse, he would do better if he preserved the grace of ready compliance. He took their advice, and promised to carry us on the morrow in his boat. We passed the remaining part ofthe day in such amusements as were in our power. Sir Allan related the American campaign, and at evening one ofthe Ladies played on her harpsichord, while Coll and Mr. Boswell danced a Scottish reel with the other. We could have been easily persuaded to a longer stay upon Inch Kenneth, but life will not be all passed in delight. The Session at Edinburgh was approaching, from which Mr. Boswell could not be absent.\" INCH LAGGAN, in Inverness, v. RHIEBUIE, and RANNOCH. INCH LONAIG, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire of Dumbarton ; it con stitutes part of the Parish of Luss. This Island is nearly a mile long, and above a quarter ofa mile broad, and contains 145 acres ; 66 of which are under a natural wood of old Yeics, some of them very large : the whole Island has for many years been kept as a Deer Park by the Family of Luss. INCH-MARNOC, ISLAND, off the South- West of the Island, and Shire of Bute. This is a beautiful little Island, about a mile in length ; and, on its West side, are vast strata of coral and shells. It is the property of The Marquis of Bute. Here are the ruins of a Chapel, which was dedicated to St. Mamoc ; and, according to Fordun, there was also a Cell of Monks. INCH MICKERY, ISLAND, in the Firth of Forth, and Shire of Edinburgh ; it constitutes part of the Parish of Cramond. It is two miles from the Main land. The Oyster beds here are almost destroyed from repeated dragging. INCH MOAN, i. e. THE MOSS ISLE, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire II 2"], [66, "I N C of Dumbarton; it constitutes part of the Parish of Luss, This Isle is about three quarters ofa mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad, and contains 99 acres, mostly covered with moss ; from which the Village of Luss, and the neighbourhood, are supplied with peats. INCH MURIN, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire of Stirling. This Island, it is said, belongs to no Parish, but the Inhabitants get Church privileges, when they apply for them, at Buchanan. It is about two miles in length, and one mile in breadth; is finely wooded, and affords excellent pasture. The Duke of Montrose, to whom it belongs, keeps it as a Deer Park: and, in 1793, His Grace built a neat Hunting-Seat and Offices, which are inhabited by the Forester and his Family. At the South end, are the ruins of an old Castle, once the residence ofthe ancient Earls of Lennox. INCHTURE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parish of Rossie united, in 1670; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was nearly 13 bolls of wheat, 46 bolls of barley, 36 bolls of meal, and 34 bolls of oats, and nearly \u00a31 1. in money : the glebe, by the annexation of that formerly at Rossie, is about 11 acres, including the garden : Patron, The Crown : The Church, and manse, are both old. It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Balledgarno, and Polgavie) was 949, and, in 1811, was 954. It is 9 m. W. b. S. from Dundee, and 49 j m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post- Office is established here. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The soil is exceedingly rich, and well cultivated. The village of Inchture is the sole property of Lord Kinnaird, who has lately added much to its neatness and convenience ; the great Road, from Perth to Dundee, passes through it. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a large and commodious house. A great part ofthe pleasure grounds and plantations around Dr immie- House, the Seat of Lord Kinnaird, extend into this Parish ; and adjacent to the Park, are the ruins of the ancient Castle of Moncur, around which His Lordship has lately planted trees and shrubberies, with a beautiful effect. Balindean, the Seat of Sir John Wedderburn, Bart., is delightfully situate at the foot of the risin\u00b0 ground, which bounds the Carse of Gowrie on the North. INCH-TUTHEL, v. CAPUTH. This was formerly an Island in the Tay . and General Roy has given a plan of the old intrenchments upon it. pi. 18. INCH TY VAN ACH, in Loch Lomond, and in the Shire of Dumbarton :"], [67, "I N I it constitutes part of the Parish of Luss. This Island is about a mile long, and about two furlongs and a half broad, and contains 135 Scotch acres ; of which 127 are under a good Oak wood ; the remainder are out-field, and occasionally produce fine crops. It is uninhabited at present : but, it is said to have been, at a remote period, the residence ofa Monk, from wdiom it derives the name of Hie Island ofthe Monk's House; and a sweeter retirement, or one more adapted for contemplation, he could not perhaps have chosen. This is the highest Island in the Lake, and is composed chiefly of grey granite. It is frequented by the roebuck. TNCHYRA, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Kinnoul. This is a disjoined District, at the distance of 5 m. S. E. from Perth. This is a small Village, situate on the Eastern bank of the river Tay, and has a tolerably good harbour, which admits vessels of considerable burden. INGANESS, BAY, v. KIRKWALL, and ANDREW'S, ST.

INISHAIL. INIS-ERAITH, v. KILL-CHRENAN. INISHAIL, i. e. THE BEAUTIFUL ISLE, in the District, and Shire of Argyle : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Glen-Urchay. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 740, and, in 1811, was 750. It is a picturesque Island, in Loch Awe: upon which, the ruins ofa Monastery, for Nuns ofthe Cistertian Order, are still visible ; at the Reformation, this Reli gious House was suppressed, and the Temporalities granted to Hay, the Abbot of Inchaffrey, who, abjuring the former tenets of his religion, embraced the cause ofthe Reformers. Upon the Island is also a ruinous Chapel, which formerly belonged to the Monastery, and where Divine Worship was alternately performed with Glen-Urchay, until the year 1736 ; when it being found inconvenient, and even dangerous in many instances to navigate the Lake, a Church, more com modious for the Parish of Inishail, was then built at Inis-Drynich, nearly oppo site to the Island, on the side of the road between Inverary and Dalmally, and"], [68, "I N N 5 measured miles from Glen-Urchay ; in which Churches, Divine Worship is now alternately performed. Here isa small School, very poorly endowed, though the assessment on the valued rent, to form a Salary, is more than common in such cases. INNERGELLY, v. KILLRENNEY. INNERKIP, or INVERKIP, in the Shire of Renfrew : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 78 bolls of meal, and \u00a3350. Scotch in money : the manse has lately been re-built in an elegant and commodious style: the glebe consists of 4 acres of arable land : Patron, Sir Michael Stewart, Bart , of Blackball : The Church is in good condition, having been lately re-built. It is in the Presbytery of Paisley, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Daff, and Gourock and part ofthe lands of Garvock) was 1367, and, in 1811, was 1632. It is 5\\ m. S. W. from Greenock. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, stretching along the coast ofthe Firlh of Clyde, which is here indented with several convenient Bays. Upon the shore, the soil is light, sandy, and of quick vegetation ; but farther in the interior, it becomes more wet, and gravelly: upwards of one-half is moor and covered with heath, the remainder being arable, and generally inclosed. The Village of Innerkip is pleasantly situate on the banks ofthe small river Kip, at its confluence with the Firth of Clyde, and is a well frequented Sea-bathing place. The Fisheries are prosecuted here with great success. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, toge ther with School-fess, and perquisites. Here is a Ferry across the Firth, which is about 5 miles broad, to Dunoon in the Shire of Argyle. The Public road is in good repair. Ardgowan, the seat of Sir Michael Stewart, Bart., of Black hall, is a large house, delightfully situate upon the shore, and surrounded with extensive plantations. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. INNER-PEFFRAY, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Madderty. It is 3- m. S. E. from Crieff. This is a small Village, situate on the Eastern bank of the river Earn, over which there is a Ferry here. The Castle, is in ruins. At this place is a Charity School for poor children, and a good room, with a Library, for the use of the neighbourhood, founded by David Lord Madderty ; and which still continues to receive additional supplies of Books. INNERWELL, PORT, v. SORBIE. INNERWICK, in the Shire of Hadington : formerly a Rectory, and Vicar age, the Stipend of which, in 1811, including the glebe, was \u00a3170. ; Patron,"], [69, "I N N William Nisbet, Esq. , of Dirlton : The Church was built, in 1784 ; the manse was erected about the year 1726, and repaired in 1788. It is in the Presbytery of Dunbar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 846, and, in 1811, was 899. It is 5 m. S E. b. S. from Dunbar. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and from two to six miles in breadth. It is bounded on the North and East by the German Ocean. The shore is rocky. The face of the country is level, and the soil fertile ; on the borders, farthest removed from the sea, the land rises into considerable emi nences, which are partly covered with heath, but, even there, much has been improved, and converted into tillage : on the coast, the soil is rather light and gravelly : the greater part is well enclosed, and there are a few Plantations. Land lets very high here. The air is generally dry, and healthy. Coal is used as fuel upon the coast ; but peats, and turf, on the moors. There are two free stone Quarries ; and, on the coast, lime is abundant. At a place, called Scateraic Shore, several Ships have been wrecked ; where there is a small creek, which might easily be converted into a Harbour. On Black Castle Hill is a small encampment, which is said to be Danish. A great variety offish is caught here ; but the Lobster fishery is the most profitable. There was anciently within this Parish a Chapel, dedicated to St. Dennis, the ruins whereof are still standing on a small Promontory, in the Northern corner of it. According to Mr. Chal mers, the extensive Manor of Inner-Wick was granted by David the First to Walter the son of Alan, The First Stewart : and his descendants enjoyed the Superiority of it, until recent times. On the 10th of December 1404, this Barony, and indeed the whole possessions of The Steicart, of Scotland, were erected by Robert the Third into a free Regality, as a Principality for the eldest son ofthe Scotish Kings. When Renfrew became a separate Shire, the Barony of Inner- Wick was annexed to it ; as it was part ofthe Stewartry, though it was actually situate within East Lothian. Between the years 1661 and 1669, Charles the Second, as Stewart of Scotland, granted many charters to the Vassals of the Stewartry, living upon the Manor of Inner-Wick : and their lands are described as lying in the Constabulary of Hadington, and Sheriffdom of Edinburgh, but by annexation, within the Sheriffwick of Renfrew. Sir Peter Wedderburn, of Gosford, who became a Senator of the College of Justice, in 1668, obtained in February 1670, to him and his heirs of entail, a grant ofthe Rectory and Vicar age tythes of Inner-Wick. In July 1670, he obtained a grant to him, and his heirs of entail, ofthe Barony of Thornton, in this Parish. And, in January 1671,"], [70, "I N V he obtained the Barony itself of Inner-Wick. The Castle, -which was one of those small Fortresses built for the defence ofthe Borders, belonged to a younger branch ofthe Family of Hamilton, Dukes of Hamilton, and who from it were styled Hamiltons, of Inner- Wick. It was taken by The Duke of Somerset, in 1547, when Patten in his account ofHis Grace's expedition, calls it Andericyke. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of its ruins. INNES, v. URQUHART. INN1SVOULS, ISLE, one of The Scilly Islands. This is a very small Isle, containing only 4 acres ; and is situate to the North-East of St. Mary's. INSH-AVON, v. TANNADICE. INSHOCH, v. AULDEARN. INVAR, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Little Dunkeld. It is \\ m. W, S. W. from Dunkeld. This is a small Village, situate at the confluence ofthe rivers Bran and Tay, on the great Highland road from Perth to Inver ness : here is a Ferry over the Tay, and a good Inn. The celebrated composer of Scotch Reels, Neil Gow, is a native of this Village. INVER, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Assint. It is situate near the confluence ofthe little river Culag with Loch Inver, and is an excellent fishing Station. It is 245 m. N. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Harbour is spacious, and very safe. There is a Burying-place at the Farm here. INVER-ALLEN, partly in the Shire of Inverness, and partly in the Shire of Elgin : an ancient Vicarage, now comprehended in the Parish of Cromdale: The Church is situate on the Western bank of the river Spey, and, together with the surrounding Burying-place, is still in use. It is 1-J m. S. W. from Grantown. INVERALLOCHIE, CASTLE, v. RATHEN INVERARITY, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Rectory, with Methie united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a350. in money, 48 bolls of meal, and 48 bolls of barley: the manse is a very superior one, and in good condition, commanding a delightful prospect of a part of Strathmore, and what adds to its beauty is a small thriving plantation which surrounds it, and the water of Ker bat that runs in front : the glebe consists of 12 acres : Patron, Fotheringham, of Powrie : The Church has lately been repaired. It is in the Presbytery of For far, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 820, and, in 1811, was 865. The Church, which is nearly in the centre ofthe Parish, is about 4\\ m. S. from Forfar. This Parish is about three"], [71, "I N V miles square. The surface is uneven. The soil is in general a clay ; and the lands are well cultivated, and substantially inclosed either with hedge rows, or stone dykes. The greatest part of the waste grounds have been planted, and are in a very flourishing condition. Part of the Roman Camp at Kirk Buddo, called Hare Faulds, extends into this Parish. Fotheringham is the elegant Man sion ofthe Ancient Family of Fotheringham, whose principal residence was for many years at Wester Powrie, in the Parish of Muirhouse, Towards the West, is the House of Kincaldrum, the residence of Graham Bower, Esq., the whole property of which respectable Family lies within the bounds of this Parish. INVERARY, or INVER- ARAY, a Royal Borough, having separate Juris diction, locally situate in the District, and Shire of Argyle: formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Glen-Aray annexed, though two distinct Benefices, viz., The Highland Charge or First Minister, and The Lowland or English Congrega tion: both the Benefices are augmented to \u00a3150. each: and The Duke of Argyle, who has at all times countenanced the Clergy, particularly the Minis ters of this Place, has uniformly accommodated them with farms at a rent far below their value : both Ministers have good commodious houses, with suitable offices, pasture and hay for two cows and a horse, and allowance for a garden ; and the Minister of the Highland Charge has also an allowance for a glebe : Patron, The Duke of Argyle : An elegant Church in the Gothic style, after a design by Mr. Milne, has lately been erected, comprising the two places of Worship under one roof. It is in the Presbytery of Inverary, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2051, and, in 1811, was, For the Burgh, and Parish of Inverary, 1113. For the Parish of Glen-Aray - - 948. 2061. It is 1I4| m. W. b. N. from Edinburgh. It is a regular well-built town, plea santly situate on a small Bay, a few miles from the head of Loch Fine, where the river Aray, or Aoreidh falls into that arm ofthe sea. The Old Town, which was a dirty ill-built village, situate ou the North side ofthe Bay, upon the lawn immediately before the Castle, was removed to its present site, and the greater part re-built by The Duke of Argyle, who is Proprietor ofthe whole Town. It seems probable, that, prior to the beginning ofthe Fourteenth Century, Inverary VOL. II. I"], [72, "I N V waslittle more thana place for fishermen, who lived by their occupation ; but, about that period, the Family of Argyle having fixed upon it as their place of residence, and the Hereditary Jurisdictions of Justiciary and Sheriff of Argyle being vested in them, it became the Seat of the Courts, and the Shire Town : and here the Circuit Court of Justiciary, for the Western Circuit, is holden. It was erected into a Royal Borough by a Charter from King Charles the First, dated at Caris brook Castle in the Isle of Wight, on the 28th of January 1648 ; and is governed by a Provost, 2 Baillies, and a Council, nominated by The Duke. Inverary is one ofthe Contributary Royal Boroughs with Irvine, in sending one Member to Parliament. The Revenues arise from the petty customs, and the rent of a Common, which, at the first erection ofthe Burgh, was bestowed upon it by the family of Argyle : and, some years ago, Archibald Duke of Argyle, seeing how inadequate this revenue was for the occasions ofthe Burgh, added to it a perpetual annuity of \u00a320., secured upon his estate. The inhabitants are em ployed in various manufactures of linen, woollen, iron, and carpentry; but the chief support ofthe place is from the numerous shoals of herrings that annually visit Loch Fine. The Salary of the Grammar School is \u00a331.. 11.. 8., and that of the English School is \u00a319.. 3.. 4. : both the Masters have quarter fees and perqui sites, together with each a house, garden, and grass for a cow, gratis, from the family of Argyle. The Duke of Argyle also allows a Salary lo a Schoolmaster, who teaches near the bridge of Douglas, where the woollen manufactory is estab lished : and there is likewise a School at The Forge, in the Southern extre- mity ofthe Parish, where a Company from Lancashire, in 1754, erected a blast furnace for smelting iron ore, by means of wood charcoal. A General Post-Office is established here. The Parish of Inverary is about 18 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the coast of Loch Fine. Its appearance is hilly, and even mountainous, though interspersed with several tracts of flat land, particularly about the Town, and the vale of Glen-Shira, which is 5 miles in length. The whole ofthe level ground is arable, with a rich deep soil ; but the rest is shallow, and not naturally fertile, though that part which is in the imme diate occupation of The Duke, is cultivated upon the most improved system of agriculture. It is watered by the rivers Aray, and Shira, which fall into Lock Fine near the Town. The climate is rainy. Fuel is expensive. The Planta tions are extensive, and finely laid out, every improveable crevice, glen, and mountain, being covered with woods of immense value. The whole Parish is the property of The Duke of Argyle, except two Farms, which belong to three"], [73, "I N V small Heritors. Game, of various kinds, are in great abundance. The English is the prevailing language in the Town, and the Gaelic in the country District. Not far from the Town, is The Castle of Inverary, the princely residence of the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Campbell, Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Argyle, and Lord of Inverary : the spacious hall is hung round with arms and other ornaments, suited to the dignity of an Highland Castle ; but the rest of the house, is fitted up in a modern style, with exquisite taste ; and, from the Lawn, the scenery is grand beyond conception. A line of road Westward, across the middle of Loch Awe at the Ferry of Portansherry, to Loch Feochan on the Atlantic Ocean, a distance of twenty miles, is now under the consideration of The Parliamentary Commissioners. The old residence of the Argyle family was a very large and-strong Castle, within a short distance ofthe present one, towards the river, which has been taken down for many years : it was inhabited about the latter end of the Fourteenth Century by Colin, surnamed Jongallach or The Wonderful, on account of his marvellous exploits and odd whims ; among which may be mentioned the burning of his house at Inverary, on re- ceiving a visit from the O'Nieles of Ireland, that he might have a pretence to entertain his Illustrious guests in his splendid field equipage. Dub Loch, a deep and dark fresh water Lake, communicates with Loch Fine by a small river about a quarter ofa mile in length, over which there is a Bridge : this Lake is abundantly stocked with the finest fish, and the Family are always amply sup plied from it : it lies at the bottom of a very picturesque Glen, called Glen Shira, in which, at about two miles distance from Inverary are The Duke's Drying Barns : These buildings have been found very useful in so wet a cli mate, for, by means of them, hay may be made, or corn dried, during the heaviest rains. The Duke's whole harvest in wet seasons, and some of it in all seasons, is dried in these buildings. A particular description, with a plan of them, is given by Dr. Smith, of Campbell-Town, in his valuable Agricul tural Survey of the Shire of Argyle. His Grace has been so fully convinced ofthe utility of this mode of drying, that he has fitted up several small Barns for that purpose, in the immediate vicinity of Inverary : and, as the corn in the West Highlands is often cut down before it is perfectly ripe, and can scarcely ever be well dried by exposure in the open fields, it is much to be wished that such contrivances for drying were more common. Near the centre of the Town of Inverary, is a monument not long since erected to the memory of several gen tlemen of the name of Campbell, who were massacred at one time near 12"], [74, "I N V the spot: The amiable and patriotic Earl of Argyle having joined The Duke of Monmouth's Rebellion, in 1685, it would seem that a neighbouring Clan, aster that unfortunate expedition, was deputed by Government to carry destruction through the whole Clan of Campbell ; and, as Mr. Pennant says, \" was let slip, armed with the dreadful writ of fire and sword, to act at discretion among an unhappy people;\" seventeen Gentlemen of respectability, of the name of Camp- bell, were taken at Inverary, and instantly executed, without even the formality of a trial. The monument contains an inscription, commemorating, with a moderation that does honour to the writer, the justice of the cause in which his relatives fell. Besides this Monument, there stands in the plain before the Castle, a long rude Pillar of stone, said to have been erected to their memory ; but in many parts ofthe Highlands, similar stones point out the Burial place of some Hero, which are of much earlier date ; and there is scarcely a doubt but that this Pillar has been erected at a period much more remote than the massacre of the Campbells.

IN VER- AVON, partly in the Shire of Banff, and partly in the Shire of Elgin: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 800 merks Scotch, and 60 merks Scotch for Communion elements, with 48 bolls of meal, at 8 stones the boll : a glebe of 4 Scotch acres and 28 falls, together with grass for two cows, and a horse : the manse was built in 1775, and the offices in 1769 : Patron, Lord Seafield : The Church, which is very old, is dedicated to St. Peter. This was the Seat of the Chancellor of the Diocese of Moray and the Vicar ages of Knockando and Urquhart, were dependent upon it. It is in the Pres bytery of Aberlour, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2107, and, in 1811, was 2260. It is |I| m. N. E. from Gran town. This Parish is about 18 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth ; and, besides the rivers Avon and Spey, is watered by the Lives, a stream which gives the name of Glen Livet to a considerable District of this Parish. The surface is irregular, but not mountainous : the soil in the lower grounds is wet, and mossy: on the sides ofthe hills, it is light, and dry : but in more elevated situations, it becomes muiry : the District of Glen Livet is remarkably fertile, the soil being a light loam, on a bed of limestone. Around the walls of the old Chapel of Dunan, is a burying-ground ; and, at Deskie, about five miles higher up the glen, on the West side of the Cromby, and opposite to Badavochle, there was another ; both of which are hi use. There was also a Chapel, and Burying-ground, on"], [75, "I N V the West side of Avon, in the estate of Kill-Machlie, almost opposite to the mouth of Livet; and the Farm-town, in the midst whereof it was, is from it called Chapel-Town: there are evident marks of graves, with stones set up at the heads of some of them ; but no Person has been buried here, for time imme morial. Within the Church-yard is a good School-house, which is slated : the salary being 12 bolls of meal, at 9 stone the boll. In Glen Livet, there is one of the Society's Schools, which is ambulatory between Deskie, and Badavochle, being stationed sometimes at the one place, and sometimes at the other ; the salary being about \u00a3 15. Sterling, which is esteemed too little. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. There are the remains of three Druidical temples, near the House of Ballendalloch, on the grounds of Bellaviller, and a third on a small rising ground, a little below the mouth of the Livet, called Tlie Dune of Dilmore. Peats are abundant here. INVER BAGASTY, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Far. It is situate at the confluence ofthe river Bagasty with Loch Naver, and at the distance of 233\u00a3 m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. INVER BERVIE, v. BERVIE. INVER -CARITY, or INVER-QUHARITY, v. KIRRIE-MUIR. INVERCAULD, v. BRAE-MAR.

It is in the Presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 626, and, in 1811, was 552. It is 67 m. N. from Rothesay. It is situate at the confluence of the rivulet Chaolain with Loch Straven, an arm of the sea, which intersects the Parish for about 8 miles, and abounds with various kinds of fish. The surface is rugged, and principally appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The rains are frequent, and heavy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. Game is in plenty. Here is a considerable extent of natural wood. Knockdow is the seat of James Lamont, Esq., a Gentleman of considerable landed property ; and who, under many dis advantages of climate and soil, raises crops equal to any in the West of Scotland. South-Hall is the delightful residence of Mr. Campbell, Proprietor of nearly one"], [76, "I N V half ofthe Parish. On the farms of Arde in, and Achavuillin, arc many vestige* of graves, and cairns. At the mouth of Loch Ridan, is a small Island, called Eallang - Heirrig , which is memorable as being the place, in 1685, where The Duke of Monmouth, in his invasion ofthe Kingdom in concert with Archibald Earl of Argyle, deposited his spare arms and ammunition; and which soon after fell into the hands ofthe Royal party. INVER-CRUDEN, v. CRUDEN. INVER-ERNON, v. TARLAND. INVER-ESK, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was two chalders of wheat, three chalders of barley, and three chalders of oats, paid in money, at the fiars of Mid- Lothian, and \u00a362. in money, including Communion elements : there is likewise a glebe of 5j acres, inclosed by Alexander Carlyle, D. D., together with a manse, and garden, and a field before the house, making in all an acre, which were given by the Town of Mussel burgh to the Minister ofthe Parish, when the manse was built in 1681 ; and for an addition to this field, made in 1758, he pays one shilling yearly of feu-duty : Since 1702, there has been an Assistant Probationer, for whom there is a very slender support, out of certain funds allotted for that purpose : Patron, The Duke of Buccleugh : The Church, which is ruinous, was dedicated to St. Michael, and is built on the site of a Roman Fort, and with many of the materials from the ruins ofthe Pr\u00e6torium. It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing The Jurisdiction ofthe Burgh of MuBselburgh ; and the Country District, which comprises the village of Inver-Esk, the country of South-East, Monkton-Hall, MonktonanrfCairney,White-Hill\u00ab\u00bbcZ New Hailes, Stony-Hill and Stony- Bank, and the Coal-pits at Craig-Hall) was 6604, and, in 1811, was 6393. It is 5 m. E. from Edinburgh. The situation of this Parish is one ofthe most beautiful in Scotland, upon the banks ofthe river Esk, which empties itself about half a mile below into the Firth of Forth : and from the salubrity of the climate, and its agreeable site, has obtained, of old, the name ofthe Montpellier of North Britain. It contains 3571 acres, the soil of which varies according to its distance from the sea : along the coast it is sandy, but having been for ages in a high state of culti vation for gardens and small fields, in the neighbourhood of the villages is abundantly fertile : on the banks of the river, the soil is naturally productive : towards the South-East and South-West, it is more ofa clayey nature, capable of raising great crops, especially of wheat, under proper culture: agriculture is,"], [77, "I N V however, but little improved, though some of the Farmers have adopted the new System. Between the Village, and the Towns of Musselburgh and Fisher-Row, lie the spacious and pleasant downs called Musselburgh Links, which furnish a field for playing the Golf, the favourite amusement of the inhabitants, and dry walks at all seasons ofthe year. From the foundations of various buildings, and other antiquities that have been discovered here, it appears that this was not merely a military Station, but was a Colonia Romana or Municipium ; and that the Romans had many houses and buildings near the sea, as well as their Pr\u00e6 torium at Inver-Esk. In this Parish lies the field of The Battle of Pinkie, in 1547, under their Regent, The Earl of Arran, when Queen Mary was an Infant, and with such slaughter among the Scots : this battle was fought on the field that lies between the Village of Inver-Esk and Walliford, and Carberry ; and was brought on by the usual impetuosity ofthe Scots, who would not wait until the English army, commanded by The Protector Somerset, which was begin- ning to run short of provisions, had been obliged to return home. The Scottish army were encamped on that large field West of the Esk, which went by the name of Edminstone Edge ; the English lay at the places, now called Drum- more and Walliford. Just over the field of battle, there is a hill, which was still more fatal to this imprudent Princess, on the 15th of June 1567, and has been known ever since by the name of the Queens Seat : this is the top of the hill of Carberry, where the Queen sat upon a stone, and held a conference with Kirkaldy, of Grange, who had been commissioned for that purpose by the Con- federate Lords of Scotland : During this parley, the profligate Bothwell, who had taken leave of the Queen for the last time, rode off the field to Dunbar : As soon as he was out of danger, Mary suffered herself to be led by Kirkaldy to Morton and the other Lords, who received her with due marks of respect, and ample promises of future loyalty and obedience : the sequel is well known : The Society of Antiquaries of London, with a laudable zeal to commemorate Histo- rical events, have published a curious view of this subject : And the late Proprietor of Carberry, John Fullarton, Esq., has marked this spot to posterity by planting a copse-wood upon it. Pinkie House was built by Alexander Seton, first Earl of Dunfermlin, in the year 1622 : on the forfeiture ofthe family, in 1688, the House, and Barony, were purchased by the Noble family of Tweed- dale, from whom, in the year 1778, it was bought by Sir Archibald Hope, Bart., of Craighall, and is now a more comfortable dwelling-house than ever. Free-stone, and lime-stone, are abundant : but the most valuable mines are"], [78, "I N V those of coal, which lie under the whole Parish, and are very productive. The Roads are bad. When Oliver Cromwell was here in 1650, while his foot were encamped on the Links of Musselburgh, the Church served as a Stable for his cavalry ; and the place, where his own tent was erected, is still shown on the Links. There are two mounts or ramparts ; one on the North side, and another on the East end of the Church-yard, that are called Oliver's Mounts, and are supposed to have been thrown up by Cromwell ; one of them to command the Bridge, and the other to defend his magazine, which was in the village of Inver- Esk. The Duke of Buccleugh is Patron ofthe Parish, as possessing the Lord ship of Inver-Esk ; which formerly belonged to Sir Robert Dickson, of Car berry, and who sold it to The Duchess of Monmouth, about the beginning ofthe Eighteenth Century. His Grace holds also the lands of Smeaton and Castle- Steads, and likewise the Lordship of Musselburgh, in this Parish. The Town of Musselburgh has also a considerable estate in this Parish, which is holden of The Duke of Buccleugh. There are many other smaller Proprietors of land, who are all portioners ofthe Lordship of Inver-Esk, as they are called, or feuars of the Barony of Pinkie, or ofthe Town of Musselburgh. See, Musselburgh, and Fisher-Rou\\ INVER-FARIGAG, v. DAVIOT. INVER-GORDON, in the Shire of Ross ; and in the Parish of Rosskeen. It is situate on the Northern shore of the Firth of Cromarty, over which there is a regular Ferry. A General Post-Office is established here. It has a safe Har bour for vessels of 100 tons burden, and seems well adapted for a manufacturing Village. Inver- Gordon Castle, now the seat of Mr. Macleod, of Cadboll, is surrounded with extensive woods, and is a beautiful place. INVER-GOWRIE, partly in the Shire of Forfar, and partly in the Shire of Perth : an ancient Parish, now comprehended in the Parish of Liff: The Church-yard is still in use. It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 36, and, in 1811, was 63. It is 3 m. W. from Dundee. Inver-Gowrie is of remote antiquity, as a place of Christian Worship, and perhaps the most ancient on the Northern side ofthe Tay: the first Church having been built by Boniface, a Legate or Misssionary, on his landing here with some attendants from Rome, about the year 620. About half a mile from hence, upon the hill of Inver- Gowrie, are the remains of a Roman Camp, which bears the name of Cater Mellie; it had a communication, on the North- East,with the Camp of Hare Faulds,"], [79, "I N V and it must also have answered the purpose, according to Mr. Chalmers, of keeping up a communication with the Roman shipping in the Tay : its site is now surrounded with a plantation of trees. From hence Alexander the First embarked, on his narrow escape from assassination at the Palace of Liff. A proper Pier at this place would be of singular advantage for the importation of lime, and coals, which are the principal fuel in this neighbourhood. See, Liff. INVERGUESECHAN, in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle ; and in the Parish of Ardchattan. A Missionary preaches here alternately with Glencoe, and Glen-Creran. It is in the district of GlenEtive. IN VER-KEILOR, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 174 bolls of victual, whereof 12 are wheat, and the re mainder oat-meal and barley, payable at the price of the Fiars of the County, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. Sterling for Communion elements: the manse was re-built in 1805 : the glebe consists of 4 acres of arable land, and \u00a315. Scotch, with a brae of about an acre for grass : The Church is in excellent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Brothock, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1704, and, in 1811, was 1787. It is 6 m. N. b. E. from Aber-Brothock. This Parish contains upwards of 8000 acres. The general appearance is level, except on the North bank ofthe river Lunan, which rises by a gradual ascent the length of three middle-sized fields of good land sloping to the South. The soil is dry and fertile, and is almost all in a high state of cultivation. The air is pure, and healthy. It would appear, tliat the lands of this Parish have been long under productive cultivation, as other three Parishes have had, for time immemorial, a great part of their victual Sti pend paid from the lands of Inver-Keilor. The extent of Sea-coast is about six miles : that part of it which stretches along the Bay of Lunan, and which affords safe anchorage for ships when the wind is from the West, is flat and sandy ; but, towards the South, it is bold and rocky, and rises into a lofty Promontory, called Tlie Red Head, where there is an inexhaustible Quarry of fine free-stone, of a reddish colour: here those brilliant stones, called Scotch Pebbles, are occa sionally discovered among the fragments of the rock. The small river Keilor discharges itself into the German Ocean, about a mile from the Village ; and about half a mile South from the mouth of it, is a Fishing Village, called Ethie Haven, embosomed in a creek among the rocks. Coal is the fuel commonly used here : the partial and oppressive tax of 18|d. per boll, on all the coals that passed The Red Head to the Northward, being now abolished. The Salary of vol, II. K j"], [80, "'I N V the Parochial School is \u00a312..1..0. Sterling, and 8 bolls and 1 firlot of oats from the tenants, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a good house and garden, besides \u00a310. per annum from a mortification. There is also a School at Chapel- Town, with a Salary of \u00a37. from the same mortification. The Roads are in good repair. Upon an eminence, near the confluence ofthe river Lunan, stand the venerable ruins of Red Castle, which is said to have been built by William the Lion, and used as a Royal Hunting Seat : Mr. Grose has preserved a View of it. About a mile Eastward from Ethie House, near the sea, stand the remains of a Religious House, called St. Murdoch's Chapel, where Divine Service was performed by the Monks from the Abbey of Aber-Brothock. At Chapel Town, are the remains ofthe Chapelry of Quytefield, now annexed by Charter to the estate of Kinblythmont, belonging to Mr. Lindsay Carnegie, of Boysich ; and which is the Burying-ground of that Family : the House is old and indif ferent, but the situation is very delightful. There are the vestiges of several ancient encampments, which are ascribed to the Danes, especially those near a Farm-House, called Denmark. Ethie House, a large old mansion, built at different periods, now belonging to The Earl of Northesk, was erected by Car dinal Beaton, and was one of his Country Seats : His Lordship, who resides chiefly in Hampshire, purposes to erect a new mansion here. The other prin cipal Seats are Aniston, belonging to Mr. Rait ; \u2014 and Lawton, to Mr. Hen derson. INVER-KEITHING, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parish of Rosyth united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and a glebe of 8 acres : Patron, Sir William Erskine, Bart., of Terry, he being Proprietor ofthe estate of Spencer- Field, to which the right of Patronage is annexed : The Church is large, and in good re pair. It is in the Presbytery of Dunfermlin, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of North Queen's Ferry, and Bruce-Haven) was 2228, and, in 1811, was 2400. It is 12s m. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Wednesday in March, the third Thursday in May, the third Thurs day in June, the first Wednesday in August, and the third Wednesday in October. It is pleasantly situate upon a rising ground, on the North Coast of the Firth of Forth, at the head of a safe and spacious Bay to which it gives name. This is a very ancient Royal Borough, having received its first Charter from King William, surnamed the Lion, since which time several Scottish"], [81, "I N Y Kings granted Charters at different periods ; and James the Sixth, by a writ of novo-damus, dated the 4th of May, 1598, ratified and confirmed them all, and declared, that their rights and privileges extend from the wrater of Dovan to that of Leven, and as far North as Kinross. It is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, a Dean of Guild, and Treasurer, who are annually elected by the Counsellors and the Deacons ofthe Trades. The Town-Council, including the Magistrates, cannot be less than twenty ; but it is not limited to any greater number ; so that the whole Burgess inhabitants might be made Counsellors ; and what is very singular, the Counsellors continue in office during life and residence. Many of their extensive rights and dues have been sold and disposed of at different times ; but their annual revenue is still pretty considerable, and is faithfully applied in improvements, for the advantage and convenience ofthe inhabitants. Inver- Keithing is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Stirling, in sending one Member to Parliament. The Harbour is very commodious, having at Spring tides from 13 to 15 feet water, with excellent Quays for the accommodation of the Shipping. Coals are the principal export. Here are a few Salt-pans. A branch of the Custom-house of Borrowstown-Ness is established here, for the convenience ofthe Coasting trade carried on from this Port, and from St. David's, the property of Sir John Henderson, Bart., of Fordel, and the great Shipping place of his extensive coal-works. A General Post-Office is established here. In the time of David the First, this was a Royal residence ; there were also Convents for the Franciscans and Dominicans, and there is an ancient House, called The Inns, which still has peculiar privileges and exemptions, not being within the Jurisdiction ofthe Magistrates, and which appears to have been one of them. The Parish of Inver-Keithing is about 3| miles in length, and one mile in breadth. The surface, except the Ferry Hills, is either flat or gently rising ground; the greater part of which is a strong rich clay, yielding plentiful crops. The climate is healthy. The roads are good. Upon the summit of Lethem Hill, are the remains of a Druidical temple ; and, in the Northern part of the Parish, is a stone 10 feet high, called The Standing Stone, on which are several rude figures of men and horses. This Parish gave birth to Commodore Roxburgh, and Admiral Greig, both of whom distinguished themselves in the Russian Service. The Estates of Logie and Urquhart, near Dunfermlin, are legally in this Parish ; though annexed to Dunfermlin, quoad sacra. INVER-KEITHNY, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend K2"], [82, "I N V of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : Patron, Mr. Morison, of Bognie : The Church, and Manse, are situate in a narrow valley, near the bank of the river Doveron. It formerly belonged to the Presbytery of Huntley, and Synod of Moray ; but an exchange was made with the Parish of Mortlach, which originally was in the Presbytery of Turreff, and Synod of Aberdeen, and the Minister of Inver-Keithny still draws 6s. 8d. Sterling, as the feu-duty of a house in Elgin, which has, probably, been one of the Stalls in the Cathedral there. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 503, and, in 1811, was 533. It is 6 m. W. S. W. from Turreff. This Parish derives its name from the large Burn of Keithny, which falls into the Doveron near the Church : it is situate on the South side of the river, and is in the Commissariot of Moray : being from 5 to 6 miles in length, and between 4 and 5 miles in breadth : the soil is tolerable, and a considerable quantity of grain is annually raised here. There is scarcely any thing in the Parish, that can be called moss, or peats: the inhabit ants are supplied with peats from the mosses in the neighbouring Parishes ; and they also burn a kind of turf, which they get with difficulty upon the hills. Banff is the nearest Sea-port where coals can be obtained, and is about 12 English miles distant from the Church. There is no regular Village in the Parish. INVER KIRK-AG, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Assint. It is situate on the Western coast, and is a convenient place for a Fishing Station, though the Bay is shallow. INVER LEITH, v. LEITH, NORTH. INVER-LEITHEN, partly in the Shire of Peebles, and partly in the Shire of Selkirk : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was\u00a3150.,and a glebe of 10 acres ; the manse is in good repair : Patron, Oswald, of Auchen cruive: The Church was lately re-built, and, for its size, is one ofthe neatest in the County. It is in the Presbytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish was, In 1801. In 1811. For that part, which is in the Shire of Peebles. - 542. 635. For that part, which is in the Shire of Selkirk. - 67. 42. 609. 677. ft is 5\\ m. E. S. E. from Peebles. The Market is well supplied. The Fair is on the 14th of October. The water of Leithen, which falls into the Tweed near the middle ofthe Parish, gives name to the whole, and pours nearly all the water"], [83, "1 N V of its extensive surface into that noble river : and this is the last great accession which the Tweed receives, before it leaves the district to which it gives name. The old Parish of Inver-Leithen received as an addition, in 1674, all that part of the suppressed Parish of Kailzie, which lay North of the Ticeed. This Parish contains about 22,270 acres, Scotch measure. The general appearance of the country is broken, rugged, and precipitous, rising from the brink of the Ticeed, and the course of the Leithen, to nearly 1000 feet, without leaving, in some places, sufficient space for the breadth of a road, unless assisted by art. Windlestraw Law is the highest ground in the Parish, and is in the direction of the North-East side : near this Mountain, the Counties of Edinburgh, Peebles, and Selkirk meet. The whole exposure ofthe Parish being chiefly Southward, is productive of fine grass : the Sheep-walks, though high, are, from this cir cumstance, much valued by the farmer, as affording healthy pasture ; and up wards of 15,000 are maintained here. The climate, in such an extensive hilly district, is various ; but the air, upon the whole, is dry and salubrious. The har vest is early on the banks ofthe Ticeed. Pike, trout, and salmon, are in plenty here. It is admirably situate for manufactures, in the centre ofa country whose staple is Wool, and upon a river proper for erecting- the most powerful machinery : in consequence of which, a woollen manufacture to a great extent is carried on by the benevolence and public spirit of Alexander Brodie, Esq., which has given employment to a number of persons, and increased the prosperity of the Village. Here is a sulphureous Spring, ofthe same nature with that of Har rowgate, and is famous for its cure of various diseases, particularly in cases of scrofula, and inflammations of the eyes. The Poor are supported by a Poor's- Rate, one half paid by the Heritors, the other by the Tenants : the Rate has an additional increase every year, which is a general observation made from every Parish, where this mode of provision has been recurred to. The Session have some funds in their hands, which they distribute to the most indigent of those who receive the legal provision, in cases of particular distress. Mr. Brodie, whose generosity is only equalled by his impartiality, gives \u00a35..5..0. annually, to be distributed by the Minister to poor Householders. The Salary of the Schoolmaster is 300 merks Scotch: to which Mr. Brodie very humanely adds \u00a35..5..0.for educating poor children; and he has likewise a free house, and garden. The Castle of Horseburgh is an ancient building, on the banks of the Tweed: the present Proprietor, Mr. Horseburgh, into whose family it came by an inter marriage with the name ofTAiT, has lately laid out extensive plantations, and"], [84, "I N V inclosures ; which, whilst they add to the beauty of the country, have consider ably increased his annual income. The distance from fuel is the greatest disad vantage under which this Parish labours ; peats cannot be obtained for general use. There are the ruius of fortified Towers at the entrance of every defile ; and, on a rising ground immediately adjoining to the village, are distinct vestiges of a strong encampment, with three lines of circumvallation ; the area within being upwards of an English acre. Malcolm the Fourth granted to the Monks of Kelso the Church of Inver-Leithen, wherein his son reposed the first night, aster his decease : and he commanded, as an additional favour, that this Church should enjoy the same power of refuge or Sanctuary, as Wedale, and Tyningham pos sessed. The village of Inver-Leithen, with the circumjacent district, continued a part ofthe Royal demesne, during tlie reign of Alexander the Second : from whence it appears, that Malcolm the Fourth merely granted the Church to the Monks of Kelso, without giving them the Village, the Common of Pasture be longing to it, or the circumjacent Territory.

At the foot of Glen-Moriston is Inver- Moriston, the seat of Major Grant, which is delightfully situate at the confluence ofthe river Moriston with Loch Ness. Under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, an excellent road has been made along the North West side of Loch Ness to Bonar Ferry, a distance of 21| miles. See, Glen-Moriston. INVERNEIL, v. KNAPDALE, SOUTH. INVERNESS, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Rectory, with the ancient Rectory of Bona united, in 1618: here are Three Ministers of the Established Church: the Stipend ofthe First and Second Ministers, in 1811, being each 84 bolls 1 firlot 2 pecks 2 lippies of victual, one half bear, the other half oat-meal, and \u00a3541. .8.. 6.

The Fairs are holden on the llth of February or Wednesday after, on the first Wednesday after the 18th of July, on the first Wednesday after the llth of August, O. S., on the first Wednesday asterthe llth of September, O. S., and on the first Wednesday after the llth of November, O. S. This is a large and well built Town, situate on both sides ofthe river Ness, being united by a fine stone Bridge of seven arches ; and where it discharges its waters into the Moray Firth. It is a Royal Borough of great antiquity, having received its first Charter from Malcolm Canmore, and which has been renewed by succeeding Sovereigns, until the reign of James the Sixth, when the Constitu tion of the Burgh was finally settled. The Town Council consist of 21 Members, who have a Clerk, and a Clerk-Depute : the Old Council elect annually, at Michaelmas, a New Council ; which New Council elect out of their number, a Provost, 4 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, and a Treasurer; the Provost is, however, commonly continued in office for three years ; and the Bail lies, the Dean of Guild, and the Treasurer, for two years. There are six Incor porated Trades, who annually elect at Michaelmas, 6 Deacons, and 6 Box- Masters or Treasurers, each Corporation having its own peculiar Deacon and Box-Master : the 6 Deacons elect a Deacon-Convener, to preside over and to attend to the Interests of all the Corporations ; they elect at the same time a general Box-Master : the 6 Corporations are represented in the Town Council by their Deacon-Convener, who, by virtue of his office, is a Member, and by two Deacons annually elected by the Town Council. There are besides these, several other Crafts which are not Incorporated. In the High-Street, nearly in the centre of the Town, stands the Court-House, connected with the Tolbooth ; a handsome modern Building, with a fine Tower, terminated by an elegant Spire :"], [86, "I N V criminals not only from the Shire of Inverness, but also from the Shires of Orkney, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross, Cromarty, Nairn, and Elgin, are confined in this Gaol.

It is the Shire Town, and may properly be called The Capital of the Highlands; and here the Circuit Court of Justiciary for the Northern Circuit is holden. The Academy, which does honour to the Promo- ters of it, is an elegant and commodious Building, provided with a Rector, and four Masters ; by wdiom every branch of Polite Literature is taught with a correctness and judgment that amply bespeak the proper choice made of them, for the due discharge of their several important and arduous Offices. And it would be unpardonable not to add, that Mr. Alexander Nimmo, (since removed to Ireland) exclusive ofthe celebrity with which, as Rector of the Academy, he conducts his department, has rendered essential service to Government by his accurate investigation of The Boundary Line of the Northern Counties, and which is honourably recorded to have been performed \" with a zeal and intelli- gence surpassing the expectation of The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges.\" The Directors of this excellent Seminary are, tbe Provost, 4 Baillies, Dean of Guild, Sheriff of the County, and the Moderator of the Pres- bytery of Inverness (of which this is the Seat), for the time being. Besides The Academy, there are, in the Town and Parish of Inverness, other 10 Schools \u25a0 four of which are established by the Society for propagating Christian Know ledge. \" Hither,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" the inhabitants ofthe inland parts come to be supplied with what they cannot make for themselves ; hither the youn^ Nymphs of the mountains and vallies are sent for education, and, as far as my observation has reached, are not sent in vain.\" The Harbour is safe and com- modious, allowing vessels of 200 tons to unload at the Quay ; and vessels of 500 tons may ride in safety in the Moray Firth, within a mile ofthe Town. A few years ago, on the Western extremity of a Hill overlooking the Town, were the ruins of one of Oliver Cromwell's Forts, and of a Castle, supposed to have been built by Malcolm Canmore ; but these have been razed to the founda tions, and the ground cultivated. Of the Castles of Macbeth, and of the Cummings, which stood in this District, nothing but rubbish now remains. It is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0.. 30'.. 5\" North.\u2014 The Parish of Inverness is 10 miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth: its appearance is varied, being partly flat, and partly hilly, rocky, and mountainous : the soil is fertile, the general character of"], [87, "I N V it being, with some exceptions, a black loam, rather light, and on a gravelly bottom. The air is dry, and healthy. The Parish abounds with very extensive Plantations, all of which are in a flourishing state. The great Military, and County, roads and bridges are kept in excellent repair. The principal disad vantage under which this Town and Parish labour, is the scarcity of fuel : the Peat-mosses in the neighbourhood being either exhausted, or inclosed and planted. The Convent of Dominicans, or Black Friars, which was founded, in the year 1233, by Alexander the Second, was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell, and the stones applied to the erection ofa Citadel at the mouth ofthe river: the yard ofthe Monastery is now the glebe of one ofthe Ministers, and the site of the Church, is a small burying-place ; the Chapel-yard, an inclosure of about 6 acres, is the principal Burying-ground of the Town and Parish. Near the Town, on the West side ofthe river Ness, is Tom na Heurich, i. e. Tlie Hill of Fairies, a beautiful insulated Mount, nearly resembling a Ship, with her keel uppermost : it was inclosed and planted, in 1753, and is elevated 250 feet above the level of the river. The most remarkable Mountains in this Parish, form that range on the West side of the river, which is a continuation ofthe great chain, running from Loch Lomond to the Firth of Tain, known by the name of Dr umalbin, and which divided the Scottish from the Pictish kingdom. In this range, on the summit of a rock, called Craig Phatrick, are the remains ofa vitrified Fort, generally supposed to be Pictish, and which is 1150 feet above the level of the river. On the upper plain of the Parish, due East from the Town, were several Druidical temples ; one of them only being at present entire, the rest, which stood on cultivated fields, having been blasted for the purpose of building farm houses, and offices. According to Mr. Nimmo, there is a small field on the East side of the Academy Street, of about 4 acres, which belongs to the Shire of Nairn; and in which the Chapel of Ease and some Houses have been built, but being situate within the Burgh of Inverness, it is not even valued in the Cess books of Nairn; and, unless as a curiosity, it is not therefore worthy of notice. In the earlier periods ofthe History of Scotland, its Monarchs appear to have had a very slight and doubtful authority over the Northern and Western parts of the Realm. The Isles of Orkney and Shetland, and even the Province of Caithness, were possessed by the Norwegian Princes, while the Hebrides, and even the adjacent shores of the Main-land, were entirely under the sway of The Lords of the Isles. The neighbouring mountainous country was inhabited by rude and barbarous tribes, who had never been reduced under regular authority VOL. H. L"], [88, "I N V or government. The Divisions of the North, therefore, or Sheriffdoms, we ought only to consider as comprehending the Low Country, and that part, in parti cular, in the immediate neighbourhood of the County Town. Indeed, unless taken in this point of view, the limits anciently assigned to The Shire of Inver ness entitle it to be considered rather as a sort of Vice-Royalty, than as one of the secondary Divisions of the Kingdom. The earliest notice of the existence ofthe office of Sheriff is, in the Acts of David the First, i. e., about the middle of the Twelfth century. It appears, that the Sheriffdom of Inverness compre hended, at that time, the whole ofthe Kingdom to the North ofthe Grampians. An Act, which allows any man, accused of theft, a certain period to produce the person from whom he might allege that the goods had been bought, runs in this style : \u2014 \" A if ane dwellis bezond Drum Albin, in Moray, Ross, Caithness, \" Argyle, or in Kintyre, he sail have fysteen daies and eke ane month, to \" produce his warrand before the Schiref; and gif he goes for his warrand \" dwelland in Moray, Ross, or in any ofthe Steids or places pertaining to \" Moray, and can nocht find nor apprehend his warrand, he shall pass to \" the Schiref of Innerness, wha sail,\" &c. \u2014 Reg. Majes. 1. 16. The Names Moray, Ross, &c, are indeed sufficiently ancient, as applied to cer tain districts ofthe Country, but their signification is vague and indefinite. We may suppose, however, that the Steids appertaining to Moray, refer to the limits of the Bishopric, Moray being the only existing See, North of Spey, previous to the reign of David the First. The Shire of Moray appears to have been dis joined from Inverness as early as the year 1263, when Gilbert de Rule, Knight, is mentioned in a deed in the Chartulary of Moray, as Sheriff of Elgin. It may, indeed, be reasonably doubted, whether his Jurisdiction extended over the whole County of Moray in the modern acceptation of the term ; in fact, the title of Sheriff of Moray does not occur, till near a century after this ; the Office being first created in the person of Alexander Dunbar, son to the last James Dunbar, Earl of Moray. Even about this time, however, we find the Sheriff of Inver ness continued to exercise some Jurisdiction within the County of Moray or Elgyn: for, in a question respecting the Multures ofthe Lands of Quarry wood, near Elgyn, Robert Hay, Sheriff of Inverness, gave judgement alon^ with \" The Honourable and Potent Lord Archibald Douglas, Knight,\" who must have been the Earl Archibald, and not merely the Sherif, as the Author ofthe History of Moray supposes. The Shires of Forres, and Nairn, and of Crombath"], [89, "I N V or Cromarty, appear to have been erected as early as that of Elgyn : we find them mentioned in the Regulations adopted for the Government of Scotland after its conquest by Edward the First, in 1304. The Regulations being little known, an extract (from Rymer's F\u0153dera) is made of a part of them, which throws much light on the Division of Scotland at that period : Likewise it is agreed, that the Viscounts (Sheriffs) who shall dwell in the land, be people born ofthe country of Scotland, or English, and be appointed and removed by the King's Lieutenant and by the Chamberlain, according to their discretion. These Sheriffs perform every thing relating to Escheats as the Sheriffs were wont to do, and that they who shall be appointed Sheriffs be the most sufficient, the fittest, and most profitable that can be found, for the King, for the People, and for keeping and maintaining the Peace ; and for the present, the Roll of Sheriffs to be as follows :\u2022 \u2014 1.

It does not appear, that Edward removed any of those Persons who held their Offices by Charter, since we find the Heritable Sheriffs of Kinross, Selkirk, and Cromarty are mentioned : the name ofthe last is much disfigured by successive transcribers, but we are still able to discover that the Urquharts, of Cromarty, had a separate Jurisdic tion in this small tract, while most ofthe North of Scotland was comprehended in the Shire of Inverness. This system of Hereditary Jurisdiction, which we see had already begun, extended by degrees over the greater part, if not the whole, of Scotland. It was in many instances of the most pernicious effect, in obstructing or defeating the purposes of justice and national polity, while, to accommodate the prejudices of Feudal times, some singular annexations and subdivisions were made in the different Counties. The Abolition of this System, in 1748, is therefore considered with justice, as one of the greatest National benefits that Scotland ever received, \u2014 of greater importance to her prosperity and welfare, than even The Union of the Kingdom. But the Act of 1748, though well intended, did not do enough ; for, although these annexed lands were by that Act made subject to the Sheriff Courts of that Shire in which they are locally situate, or to which they are more immediately adjacent ; yet, in all other cases, whether of Police, Taxation, Military Service, or Elective Fran chise, they remain in the same circumstances as before. Whether the ancient Sheriff is to be considered as a Civil or a Military Officer, is not determined. Besides his Office as a Judge, he had the power of calling out the Militia and presiding at \" Weapon Showings,\" though this probably only extended to the Freeholders or Tenants in capite. It would appear, however, that there was no"], [91, "I N V Sheriff but in the Stations where Royal Fortresses existed. This was, at least, the case at Elgin, Forres, Nairn, and Inverness ; to the North of which last men tioned place, there does not appear that any Royal Fortress ever existed. The Sheriff also appears to have been ex officio Keeper or Constable ofthe Castle ; we see, that this is particularly mentioned with respect to the important Fortresses of Stirling and Dumbarton, under Edward, and we shall find it the case likewise in Nairn. Justice was at that time more frequently administered in the Halls of the Baron, or by the decision of the Church, than in the Court ofthe Sheriff, and hence we may account for the influence which the Clergy had in regulating the bounds of Counties. The erection ofthe Sheriffdom of Moray, properly so called, took place in the reign of James the Second, and was, perhaps, the first material dismemberment of the Shire of Inverness. In tracing its history it appears, that Thomas Randolph had been created Earl of Moray with very extensive powers, by King Robert Bruce. His Jurisdiction comprehended the whole Country from Spey, to the Western Ocean, and was bounded on the North by the river Forna or Beaulie. This Earldom, after two generations, reverted, by the failure of male heirs, to the Crown. John Dunbar, descended from the Randolphs, by the female line, having married a daughter of Robert the Second, was created Earl of Moray, with the exception of Badenoch, Lochaber, and some other districts. His descendant Alexander being accounted illegitimate, was deprived ofthe Earldom in the Minority of James the Second, but was however Knighted, and made Heritable Sheriff of Moray ; he is the first of whom men- tion is made, and the office remained with his heirs, until after The Union, in 1707. It is, therefore, probable that the Sheriffdom comprehended only the lands annexed to the Earldom after its restoration to the Dunbars, while Bade- noch, Lochaber, and the other Districts, upon reverting to the Crown, fell again under the Jurisdiction ofthe Sheriffs of Inverness. In 1405, Donald, Thane of Calder, was seized Sheriff and Constable of Nairn: his Grandson, Wtilliam, procured, in 1476, those parts of his estate, which were situate in Inverness or Forres, to be annexed to the Shire of Nairn. Hence the estate of Ferintosh in the present Shire of Ross, that of Dunmaglas in Strath Errick, and that of Easter Moy near Forres, form a part ofthe Shire of Nairn ; as does also a small field, already mentioned, in the Town and Burgh lands of Inverness. With Tespect to Roads, &c., the District of Dunmaglas is usually exchanged for that of Budzeat a part of Inverness, which is nearly as much insulated in the Shire of Nairn. The next idea of dismembering Inverness, occurs in the beginning of"], [92, "IN V the Fifteenth Century ; it being proposed by an Act ofthe sixth Parliament of James the Fourth, dated the 1 Ith of March 1503, to make a Sheriff of Ross, and one of Caithness, including Sutherland, \" because there has been great lacke \" and fault of justice in the North parts, as Caithness and Rosse, for fault of \" division ofthe Schirefedome oflnnernes, quhilk is over greate, and thay parts \" are sa far distant fra the said Burgh of Innerness,\" &c. \u2014 The defeat of Haco, King of Norway, at the battle of Largs, in the middle of the Thirteenth Century, had destroyed the power of the Norwegian Monarchs over the Western Isles. Yet, under The Lords of The Isles, they continued independent, even in name of the Crown of Scotland, till aster the battle of Harlaw, in 1411. Donald of The Isles having a right to the Earldom of Ross, raised an army of his countrymen, in order to take possession of it. Not con tented with that, he also marched forward and laid waste the country as far as the Shire of Aberdeen : being met at length by The Earl of Marr, at Harlaw, he was defeated with great slaughter, and thereupon immediately retreated to The Isles. He was, however, by no means subdued, but continued a very powerful and dangerous neighbour during the greater part of that century. His influence seems also to have been considerable even on the Main-Land ; for many families in the Shire of Inverness held their lands by Charter from The Lords of The Isles. In the beginning of the year 1476, John of The Isles was proscribed by Act of Parliament ; and a powerful fleet and army being col lected with a view to reduce him, he was persuaded to make his submission, surrendering the Earldom of Ross, which was then declared to be unalienable from the Crown, and consenting to hold his Insular possessions ofthe King in future. Although the independence of this Chieftain was thus destroyed, it does not appear that Argyle, Lochaber, or The Isles, were included in any Sheriff dom, until the beginning ofthe Sixteenth Century. For, at the same time with the Act concerning Ross, and Caithness, we have another, stating the great want of justice in the North and South Isles, \" wherethrow the people are al \" most gane wilde;\" accordingly the Act provides, that Justices shall be appointed : \" Those ofthe North Isles to have their seat and place of justice in \" Inverness or Dingwall, as the matter occurris to be decerned by the said Jus \" tices. In like manner, another Justice and Schireffe to be made for The South \" Isles, to have his place in the Tarbat of Loch Kinkerrane,\" i. e.} Campbell- Town, in Kintyre. Again, in the Acts of James the Fourth, it is stated, that there are parts between Badenoch and Lochaber, \" which have been out of use to cum to"], [93, "I N V Justice Aires\" (Assizes), wherefore it is provided, that \" the Lands, called Do \" wart and Glen Dowart, andulso the Lordship of Lome, cum and answer and \" underly the Law at the Justice Aires of Perth, Maw more Lochaber aforesaid \" to cum to the Aire of Inverness, Ergyle, when it pleases the King, sail cum \" to Perth,\" Ac- Yet, notwithstanding these Statutes, the proposed Regulations seem either to have been forgotten or very inperfectly executed, a thing by no means wonderful in a wild and inaccessible country. James the Fifth undertook an Expedition to The Isles, in 1539. Setting sail from Leith, he visited the Orkneys, Lewis, Skye, and the Western coasts ofthe Main-land, obliging the several Chieftains to submit to his authority. A particular account of this Expedition is still ex- tant, and affords a tolerable idea ofthe progress of the Scots in Navigation. The Bearings and Distances of most ofthe remarkable objects on the Voyage are noticed. It is the first time that we are accurately informed of the names of the several Clans, by our Historians, and it may be considered as the first time that the Western parts of the Kingdom were reduced into subjection. James seems to have been aware ofthe importance of this part of his Dominions in a Commercial point of view, and took considerable pains in endeavouring to intro- duce the Arts of Civilization into The Isles. For this purpose, a Company hav- ing been formed, a Colony of Settlers, drawn chiefly from the coast of Fife, was established at Stornotcay in The Lewis, and various others were projected. They had, however, to maintain their ground in Lewis by force of arms, and suffered so much annoyance from the jealous and hostile disposition ofthe Na- tives, that, at last, they were forced to come into terms with them, and entirely abandon the establishment. The task of reducing the Island of Lewis was at length accomplished by the Mackenzies, Lords of Kintail; they succeeded partly by force, and partly by fomenting the Divisions of the petty Chieftains, until the descendants of the principal Family were completely extirpated. The Manuscript Histories ofthe Family of Mackenzie describe the Inhabitants, as a race of\" pirates worse than those of Algiers,\" prone to commit the most atro- cious crimes ; \u2014 but, with mingled Pride and Satisfaction, we now draw the singular contrast to the manners of the Inhabitants of this part ofthe Empire, among whom, from Shetland to The Mull of Cantyre, a capital crime has not been known for many years. Nothing; had been done towards the Division ofthe Shire of Inverness, so late as the year 1633. In the first Parliament of Charles the First we find an Act"], [94, "I N t against the Clan Gregor, at that lime under proscription, wherein the \" Sheriffs \" of Perth, Dumbartane, Angus, Mearns, Sterling, and the Stewarts of the \" Stewartries of Strathernc, Menteith, Banffe, Invernesse, Elgyn, and Forres, \" and their Deputes, the Sheriff of Cromarty and his Deputes, with the Provost \" and Baillies of the Burghs there, the Earls of Errol, Moray, &c, are nomin \" ated Justices for tiying the said Rebels,\" &c. No notice is taken of Ross, Sutherland, Caithness, Nairn, nor Argyle. The Shire of Sutherland was first erected during- this Parliament, bv an Act in favour of The Earl of Sutherland ; it comprehended the Districts of Sutherland Proper, Assynt, Strath-Naver, and Fairmatoftan, alias Cleipholes. It does not appear, whether Caithness Proper, or the present Shire, was at that time a separate Jurisdiction or not : but, at any rate, the erection of Sutherland necessarily disjoined it from Inverness. At the Restoration, in 1660, the Counties of Argyle, Ross, Sutherland, Caith ness, and Nairn, were all distinct from Inverness, as appears by an Act of As sessment, in which Commissioners of Supply are appointed for the several Counties in order. The Boundaries of Ross, however, were not finally settled until the year 1661, since which time, excepting the Abolition of Heritable Jurisdictions in 1748, there is no material alteration in the limits of the Shire of Inverness. Inverness has the honour to give the title of Earl to His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex. INVERNESS, SHIRE. This is one ofthe most extensive Shires in Scot land. It comprehends the great Districts of Badenoch, Loch-Aber, and Glen- Elg, with several smaller Glens ; and several of the Hebrides are politically attached to it. Independent ofthe Islands, it is about 92 miles in length, and nearly 50 miles at its greatest breadth. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 74,292, and, in 1811, was 78,336. It sends one Member to Parliament, It is principally appropriated to the pasturage of black cattle. See, Inverness. INVERNETTIE, BAY, v. PETERHEAD. INVER-NOCHTIE, v. STRATHDON.

The utility of such a communication is perfectly evident, and it has been ascertained that it should pass from Inversanda to Corry, about 8 miles, on the side of Loch Linnhe, and then penetrate the interior of Morvern. The particular course of that part of the road which would be most useful to the inhabitants, and especially the point at which it is most desirable to reach the Sound of Mull, remains at present to be explored.

Here is a small Fort, originally built about the beginning ofthe Eighteenth Century, to repress the depredations of the Free booters, particularly the Clan of the Macgregors, who, at that time, infested the neighbourhood. It was burned in 1745, but was afterwards repaired ; and a Guard is now regularly mounted by a detachment of Soldiers from the Castle of Dumbarton. INVER-UGIE, v. FERGUS, ST.

INVERURY, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 64 bolls of meal and bear, and \u00a337..10..0. Sterling .- the manse was built in 1762 : the glebe consists of 4 acres : Patron, The Earl of Kintore: The Church was built in 1774. It is in the Presbytery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 783, and, in 1811, was 907. It is 137 m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This is an ancient Royal Borough, said to have been erected by King Robert Bruce, on occasion ofa signal victory obtained by him in the neighbourhood over Cumyn, Earl of Buchan, King Edward the First's General in Scotland ; which success proved the beginning of that good fortune, which attended him during the whole of his reign. The oldest Charter is a novodamus by Queen Mary ; the Preamble of which VOL. II. M"], [96, "I R V states, that \" Inverury had been a Royal Borough for time immemorial, but that the Charter of its erection had been lost during the Civil Wars.\" It is governed by a Provost, three Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and three Coun sellors ; who have under their management the small revenue collected from the customs ofthe Burgh. It it situate on a point of land, formed by the con fluence ofthe rivers Ury, and Don; over the latter of which, an elegant Bridge was erected, in 1791 : but another bridge over the Ury would contribute still further to the improvement ofthe place. The Parish of Inverury contains about 4000 acres ; of which, about 2000 are arable. Along the banks ofthe rivers, the soil is generally a light dry mould, on a bed of sand, very early, and producing excellent crops in showery summers : towards the skirts of the Mountain of Benochee, the surface is more elevated, and appropriated to the Pasturage of sheep. Woodhill is the elegant Seat, and beautifully ornamented Farm, of Mr. Johnston. Fuel is scarce. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. Inverury gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble family of Falconer, Earl of Kintore, who is Superior of most of the Houses in the Burgh, and Proprietor of one half of the Parish.

Scotch : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe consists of 8 acres ; Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church was re-built in 1774. It is the Seat ofthe Presbytery, which consists of 18 Parishes, and belongs to the Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Minister has an Assistant, whose Salary is \u00a340. : of which, \u00a315. is paid out of the Town's funds, \u00a310. by Session seats, and the rest by an annual contribution among the Inhabitants. The Resident Popula tion of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 4584, and, in 181 1, was 5750. It is 68| m. SW. b. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fair com mences on the third Monday in August, and continues the whole week. A Ge neral Post-Office is established here. It is situate on a rising ground, of a sandy soil, to the North of the river Irvine, and about half a mile distant from the"], [97, "I S A Harbour, which lies nearly to the South-West of it. The town is dry and well aired, having a broad street running the whole length of it ; on the South side of the river, but connected to the Town by a handsome stone bridge, is an uniform row of houses on each side of the road leading to the harbour, which are chiefly inhabited by mariners : a number of the same kind of houses are built on the great road leading to Ayr : none of these Suburbs, however, are icithin the Royalty, being situate in the Parish of Dundonald, and are annexed only to Irvine, quoad sacra: but part of these lands belong to the Town, as also the Quay, and an Inn, which, by a singular feu, has the exclusive privilege of selling ale and spirits there. It is uncertain when the Town was erected into a Royal Borough, but a Charter is extant from Alexander the Second, con firming some grants from other Sovereigns. Irvine, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Rothesay, Inverary, Campbell-Town, and Ayr, sends one Member to Parliament. The Revenue, arising from the Customs, and landed possessions, is very ample. The Harbour is commodious, having from 9 to 11 feet water on the bar, at spring tides. Its commerce has greatly increased of late ; coals being the principal export. The Rector's Salary of the Grammar School, which is ably conducted, is \u00a318., together with School fees, and per quisites. The Salary ofthe English teacher is \u00a310., together also with School fees, and some small perquisites. The Parish of Irvine is about 5 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. Upon the coast, and the banks ofthe river, the surface is flat, and sandy : but to the North-East ofthe town, the soil is a light loam, intermixed with gravel, and is abundantly fertile. The public roads are in good repair. The ruins of the old Castle, belonging to The Earl of Eglintoun, are said to occupy the site of an ancient Nunnery. There was also a Convent belonging to the Carmelites, or White Friars, founded by the family of Fullarton, before the year 1412, but not the smallest vestiges of it now remain. Bourtree-Hill, is the beautiful seat of The Honourable Mr. Hamilton. In this Parish arose that Religious Sect, the Buchanites, in 1784, so called from their founder, Mrs. Buchan. Irvine gave the title of Viscount to the family of Ingram, now extinct. It formerly belonged to the Monastery of Killwinning.

This Island, according to Mr. Jameson, is 32 miles long, and, in some places, nearly as broad. It is the most Southern ofthe \u00c6budee, or Hebrides ; and its name is traditionally derived from Isla, the daughter of one of the Kings of Lochlin, or Noncay, who was buried in the Parish of Killdalton. Dr. Campbell, in his Political Survey of Great Britain, remarks that it is the Epidium Insulce, of Ptolomey ; and he imagines (erroneously, however) that it is denominated Isla, or The Isle, as being the Seat of Government when the Western Isles were ruled by the Princes of The Isles. The Fair is holden on the 18th of May. On the Eastern side, the surface is hilly, and covered with heath ; but the greater part of the Island is flat, and capable of much improvement. The coast is rugged and rocky, but indented by numerous safe bays, especially that of Loch-in-Daul, where there is a harbour for ships of considerable burden, with a Quay, opposite to the large village of Bowmore. In the centre ofthe Island, is Loch Finlagan, about 3 miles in circuit, with an Islet of the same name in the middle ; where the Macdonalds, the great Lords of The Isles, resided in all the pomp of Royalty; and here the Chief was crowned, and anointed by the Bishop of Argyle, and 7 inferior Priests, in presence of his numerous Chieftains. It con tinued under The Lords of The Isles until the reign of James the Third; and, when their powers were abolished, their descendants, the Macdonalds, were the proprietors, holding directly ofthe Crown ; it afterwards passed by the for tune of war to the Macleans ; but James the Sixth, irritated by the disturbances raised by private wars, waged between these and other Clans, resumed the grant made by his predecessor, and tranferred the lands of Islay, Jura, and Muckairn, to Sir John Campbell, of Calder, on paying an annual feu-duty, of which the proportion was \u00a3500. Sterling for Islay, which is paid to this day :"], [99, "I S L Calder sold all these lands again to Walter Campbell, Esq., of Shaw field, for \u00a312,000. ; which is now little more than the Income from them, and they still continue in the same worthy and respectable family. This Island has the privi- lege of distillation, without being subject to the Excise Laws. By a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, on the 2d of July 1804, by Walter Campbell, of Shawfield, Archibald Campbell, of Jura, Archibald Macneil, of Collonsay, John Macneil, of Oronsay, Esquires, and others, it appears, \" That the extensive Islands of Islay and Jura, and also the Islands of Collonsay and Oronsay, the property of the Memorialists, labour under very great disadvantages from the want of a proper road or communica- tion with the main-land or continent ofthe Shire of Argyle. In order the more clearly to point out this, the Memorialists beg leave to submit a plan or sketch ofthe situation of these Islands with respect to the Main-land, from which it will be seen that the Island of Jura lies between Islay and the nearest part of the Main-land ; and that the shortest and most certain line of communication from Islay would be by a road from the opposite Ferry of Feoline, through Jura to the Ferry of Lagg, opposite to Keills, on the Main-land, from whence a road is already made to the Crinan Canal, and Loch- G Up- Head, which communicates with all the other Post roads in the Kingdom. That the Population of Islay is about Twelve Thousand (in 1811, 10,035), and that of the other Islands about Two Thousand more (in 1811, 1943), and owing to the want of a proper road through Jura, the Inhabitants are at present under the necessity of going by sea by a Pacquet from Port- Askaig in Islay, to Loch-Tarbert on the Main-land, and from thence to Loch- Gilp- Head, being a distance of Fifty miles, thirty-five of which are by sea, thus rendering the communication very uncertain and pre- carious, as the Pacquet is frequently detained by bad weather and contrary winds ; whereas, by having a road made through Jura, and secure landing- places for the Ferry boats, the distance, including Ferries, would be reduced to about Thirty miles, and this mode of communication passable at all seasons, one ofthe Ferries being only half a mile wide, and the other no more than five miles. Besides these circumstances the Memorialists have to state, that, in a mercan- tile point of view, this road would be of great advantage to the country at large, because it is well known that all the vessels employed in the Northern Herring Fishery, as well as those trading to the West Indies, America, and the Baltic, frequently cast anchor in the Sounds of Islay and Jura, and in the several Bays and Harbours round these Islands, where they are often detained for several"], [100, "I S L weeks ; a circumstance of which, owing to the present circuitous mode of communication with the Main-land, their owners must frequently remain long ignorant, whereas by the means ofthe proposed line of road, immediate intel ligence of their arrivals might be had, and insurance not only saved, but the Markets more securely and expeditiously supplied. The extent ofthe proposed line of road may be from Twelve to Fifteen miles, and as the tract through which it is to pass, is mostly ofa shingley or sandy nature, and stone every where convenient for the building of small bridges or covered drains, the Memorialists are of opinion the work may be executed at a moderate expense, not exceeding \u00a32000. Sterling. The Memorialist, Mr. Campbell, of Shawfield, has been at very considerable expense, and without any assistance whatever, in making roads through Islay. There is still, however, a very useful piece of road to be made from the head of Loch-in-Daul to the Point Por t-na- Haven, being the nearest part of Islay to Ireland, to which there is frequent intercourse at present from these Islands, the distance being little more than seven leagues, and were this and the other proposed line of road through Jura completed, a short and direct communication would in this way be formed between the North of Ireland and the Main-land of Scotland, which would tend greatly to facilitate the inter course between these parts of the United Kingdom ; and, in case Government should at any time think it necessary to establish a Naval Arsenal at Lock Swilly, or any other parts most fitted for it in the North of Ireland, this line of road would prove of great service and utility, as being the most certain and ex peditious way of sending intelligence from Scotland to that part of Ireland ; besides, there are several valuable Fishing Banks on the West Coast of Islay, and the opening up of the proposed roads would be of service to them. A Moiety of the expense of this road, it is supposed, may be about \u00a3800. The Memo rialists sensible ofthe great advantages which would result to these Islands, as well as to the Country at large, from the above proposed roads being made, are induced to request the aid of The Honourable Commissioners ; they proposing to raise one-half of the sum necessary to make these roads, or such of them as The Commissioners may think proper, upon a Report of their Surveyor, pro vided Government will advance the other half; and the Heritors interested in these roads will be bound to finish them, and keep the same in proper repair.\" \u2014 Mr. Campbell, of Shawfield, having previously completed at his own expense a good road from Port-Askaig at the North-East extremity of Islay, to the village of Bridge-End at the head of Loch-in-Daul on the South-West ; an excellent"], [101, "I T U line of road is accordingly now finished by the united efforts of The Commis sioners and the Heritors, from Bridge-End to Port-na- Haven, the South-West extremity of Islay, a distance of 14s miles ; thus rendering an easy and perfect intercourse across the whole Island of Islay. See, Jura, Island. There is a de creet of valuation ofthe Teinds of this Island, dated the 16th of March 1636, and recorded the 19th of January 1743, at the instance of Neil, Bishop of The Isles, against Campbell, of Calder, and others, \" Heritors of the lands within the Yle of Hay, of which Teinds the said Bishop of the Yles is Titular,\" by which decrees the whole Teinds, Parsonage and Vicarage, of the several Heritors, is \u2022 2000 merks. By decreet of disjunction and new erection at the instance of Daniel Campbell, of Shawfield, against the Moderator ofthe Synod of Argyle, &c. ; Shaufield undertakes to provide Churches, manses, and glebes for three Parishes to be established in Islay; and for this purpose, the 2000 merks of valued Teind were to be given up, towards making a Stipend to each Minister of \u00a350. Sterling, and \u00a31..13..4. for Communion elements: And in order to make up the Stipends, the Synod of Argyle gave to Shatcfield the feu and Teind tack duties of Islay, which had been granted to them by Government ; and of these duties Shatcfield obtained a Grant from the Crown. In consequence of these transactions, the Parishes of Killdalton, Kill-Arrow and Killmenie, and Kill- Choman, were established. Isla gave the title of Earl to the Family of Campbell, now extinct. ISLE MARTIN, off the District of Coigach, and in the Shire of Cromarty. It constitutes part of the Parish of Loch Broom ; being situate in that Loch, at the distance of 5 miles North-West from Ullapool. It is an advantageous Fishing Station, and is accommodated with a Custom-house. The Harbour is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0. 56.' 12\".

ITUNA, Statio, of Richard of Cirencester, at Auchterless."], [102, "JED 1 JAMES'S, ST., in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh. This Parish is now included in the Parish of Kelso. It lies between the two rivers Teviot, and Tweed. The Church was situate near to Roxburgh Castle, and on the very spot where the greatest Fair in this country, as well as one of the most an- cient, called St. James's Fair, is now holden on the 5th of August. This Church was dedicated in the year 1134. No part of it now remains, above ground, but the place where it stood is perfectly visible. The late Duke of Roxburgh, a few years ago, employed labourers to trace the foundation : while prosecuting their researches, they dug up a Tomb-stone, which had been erected to the memory of Johanna Bullock ; it was pretty entire ; and, besides some elegant Sculpture, had the following inscription in Saxoh Characters, \" Hie facet Jo- hanna Bullock, qu\u00e6 obiit anno 1371. Orate pro (mima ejus.\" Historians men- tion a William Bullock, a favourite with Edward Baliol, and generally styled The King's beloved Clerk. As this name is seldom found in Scotland, it is probable that Johanna Bullock was the daughter, or a near relation, of this eminent person, especially as he frequently resided at Roxburgh Castle. There was also discovered a considerable quantity of wheat and barley, in a charred state, scattered on a tiled pavement ; as were also several pieces of glass, and brick, which showed obvious marks of fire. All these circumstances render it probable, that this Church was burnt down in some ofthe Border wars. At a short distance from this Church, stood a Convent of Mendicants ofthe Order of St. Francis, on the North bank of the river Teviot, a little above its confluence with the Tweed. Within these few years a fine arch of their Church remained, and other parts of the building, which are now almost wholly obliterated. This Monastery was consecrated by William, Bishop of Glasgow, in 1235. Adam Blunt was their Superior, in 1296. See, Kelso. JAMES-TOWN, v. WESTER-KIRK. JARDINE HALL, v. APPLEGARTH. JEDBURGH, properly JEDWEORTH, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh:"], [103, "JED formerly an Abbey, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 169 bolls of victual, half oat-meal, and half barley, Linlithgow measure, \u00a344. in money, a manse, and a glebe of seven English acres, the whole amounting to upwards of \u00a3250. per annum : the manse was built about 70 years ago, and has often been repaired at a great expense ; Patron, The Crown : a part of the old Abbey Church is still used as the place of Worship. It is the Seat ofthe Presbytery of Jedburgh, and belongs to the Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Royal Burgh, and Parish, in 1801, was 3834, and, in 1811, was 4454. It is 45 m. S E. b. S. from Edinburgh. It has a good weekly Market (on Mon day) for corn and cattle, and has several well attended Fairs. It appears to have been a place of consequence previous to the year 1165, by a Charter from William the Lion, King of Scotland, and before the Foundation of the Abbey, or, as it was then sometimes called, Jedwarth. The Town is governed by a Provost, and three Baillies, assisted by a Select Council ofthe principal Inhab itants. Jedburgh, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Dunbar, Hadington, Lauder, and North Berwick, sends one Member to Parliament. It is plea santly situate on the banks ofthe river Jed, and is surrounded with hills of con siderable height. Early in the last Century, it was one ofthe most important Towns on the English Border : but, after The Union of the two Kingdoms, the trade of Jedburgh was in a great measure ruined, and the population and size of the Town diminished in consequence. The Tico Jedburghs are the oldest Parishes, in Scotland, whereof we have any distinct notice : Old Jedburgh being now a small Hamlet, about six miles S. b. E. from the present Royal Borough ; by the Charters of David the First it appears, that one ofthe Earls of Northumberland laid out a Manor there, and where a Castle, a Church, and a Mill were afterwards erected: and some ofthe adjacent Families still continue to bury in the old Church-yard. This Parish is of great extent, being about 13 miles in length, and in some places not less than six or seven miles in breadth : but the figure is irregular, being frequently intersected by the Parishes of Oxnam, and Southdean. The soil is various ; and the climate also varies in different parts ofthe Parish. The neighbourhood ofthe Town is noted for its Orchards. Here are two Chalybeate Springs, one of which, called Tud Hope Well, has been used with success in scorbutic and rheumatic disorders : there is a Sulphureous Spring, the efficacy of which is well known. A General Post- Office is established here. The common people in the neigbourhood still make use ofthe old Scotch dialect. The Circuit Court of Justiciary, for the Southern vol. il N"], [104, "JED Circuit, is holden here. The want of Coals is much experienced ; the nearest Pit being at Ryechester, at the distance of 20 miles, on the English Border. King David the First, one of the most religious Princes on the throne of Scot land, was the Founder of The Abbey, but in what year of his reign is not known : this Institution was for Canons Regular, brought from the Abbey of St. Quintin's, at Beauvais, in France ; and, as Osbert, the first Abbot, died in 1174, it is likely to have been established by the King not many years preced ing. The occurrences in this Abbey do not afford many circumstances worthy of remark. From its situation on the Borders it seems to have been exposed to the attacks ofthe English, from which cause it at last became unable to maintain the Religious of its own House, and Edward the First therefore issued orders for the removal of some of them, until the House should be repaired, and its Income increased. To this Abbey the Cells, or Sub-Priories of Reste note, and Canonby, were attached ; at the former of which, situate about a mile to the North of Forfar, and being encompassed with a Loch, except at one passage where it had a Draw-bridge, all the papers and precious things belonging to Jedburgh were carefully preserved ; the Priory of Canonby is situate upon the river Esk, in Eskdale : The Revenues of Jedburgh Abbey, including* the subordinate establishments, amounted to \u00a3 1274.. 10.. 0. Scotch. Upon its suppression, the lands were converted into a Temporal Lordship, being conferred by King James the Sixth on Sir Andrew Ker, of Fernherst, from whom is descended the present Marquis of Lothian ; the Patent, by which he was created Lord Jedburgh, bears date the 20th of February 1622, but he had long before been the favourite of that Monarch, being in 1591, one of the Gentlemen of his Privy Chamber. The Abbey,Church is one of the sinest struc tures in the country, whether it be considered either as to its magnitude, or the elegance of its architecture. On the South side ofthe Abbey, but far beneath, in a deep woody glen, runs the river Jed, whose current is impeded by rocks, over which the trees cast a shade that is highly ornamental to the Land scape. On the sides of this river are the vestiges of several artificial Caves, now, from the steepness of the rocks, scarcely accessible, which are supposed to have been places of refuge for the inhabitants, when invaded by the English. These Caves are described by those persons who have explored them, to con sist each of three apartments ; namely, one on each side ofthe entrance, and a larger one behind. The Eastern part of the Church is totally in ruins ; the walls, however, are not demolished ; the West end has one of the door-ways"], [105, "J E R of a Saxon form, peculiar to Monastic buildings, but more than usually orna mented : this part of the Abbey is of considerable loftiness, and has in the upper compartment a circular radiated Window, of correspondent workmanship. The Church exhibits throughout its whole length in the upper part, a range of small Gothic arches, which convey to the eye a lightness and beauty seldom observable, and render this building unique in that respect. The North transept has likewise a handsome Window, with its ancient ramifications still perfect. The West end is fitted up for Divine Service like most other Abbey Churches in Scotland, sufficiently in preservation for that purpose, but forming a miserable contrast to its former splendour. Various other remains of this ancient edifice might be pointed out, but they are of an inferior nature. The river Jed abounds with trout, particularly with a species of small red trout, of a superior flavour. The river Teviot also flows through this Parish. The Quarries here afford abundance of excellent free-stone. See, Nisbet. Jed burgh is situate in the Latitude of 55\u00b0 29' 40\" North, and in the Longitude of 2\u00b0 35' 30\" West from Greenwich. The liberal Policy of the Burgh is much to be commended. The Manufactories of Cloth, Flannel, and Hose have been greatly increased within the last ten years. The Regality of Jedburgh com prehended many lands, with exclusive jurisdictions ; and, in 1747, on the abolition of this Regality, The Duke of Douglas was allowed \u00a3900. as a compensation. The Bailliery was distinct from the Regality, and belonged to the Kers, of Fernherst. The Revenue ofthe Corporation, iu 1788, as the same was reported to Parliament, was \u00a3309.. 13.. 7. Sterling. The amiable Poet, Hamilton, laments, with fond recollection, \" Jeda's ancient Walls, once seat of Kings.\" In 1513, a Convent for the Observatines was founded here by the Citizens : in which Adam Abel, the Historian, lived and died. JERBURGH, CASTLE, v. GLEN CAIRN. JERSEY, ISLAND, in The English Channel. It is situate about 18 miles to the West ofthe Coast of Normandy, and 84 miles to the South of Portland in Dorsetshire ; and, in the time of the Romans, was called C\u00e6sarea. It is defended by rocks, and rapid tides ; on the North side, the Cliffs rise 40 or 50 fathoms high, which render it inaccessible there ; but, on the South, the shore is almost level with the water, which has lately made alarming inroads into the land. In the West part of the Island, is a large tract of land, once cultivated N 2"], [106, "J E R and very fertile, but now a barren desert, so caused by the Westerly winds throwing up sand from the bottom to the summit ofthe highest cliffs. General Don, the present Governor, has lately made some efforts to bring it into culti vation. The higher lands are diversified by gritty, gravelly, stony, and fine mould: the lower, bya deep, rich, and heavy soil. The middle part of the Island is somewhat mountainous, and so thickly planted with trees, that, at a distance, it resembles one entire Forest : though in walking through it, there is hardly a thicket, or any other thing to be seen but hedge-rows and orchards of apple-trees. The vallies are finely watered by brooks, and abound with cattle and small sheep ; the horses are good for draught, but few of them are fit for the saddle. On the South of the Island, the sea seems to have formerly encroached upon the land, and to have overwhelmed upwards of six square miles, making a very beautiful Bay of about three miles broad, and nearly the same in length, called St. Aubin's Bay. The Island is divided into Twelve Parishes, which are so laid out, that each has a communication with the sea ; they are subdivided into 52 vingtaines, so called from the number of 20 houses, which each is supposed to have formerly contained. The fields are inclosed by great mounds of earth, raised from six to ten feet high, proportionably thick and solid, and planted with quicksets and trees. The air is particularly healthy, and those of the inhabitants who are temperate, live to a great age. The buildings are generally of rag-stone ; but some of the wealthy inhabitants have their houses fronted with a reddish-white stone, capable of being polished like marble, and of which there is a rich Quarry on a hill, called Mont-Mado : the ordinary buildings are thatched. Fuel is scarce, for which they substitute vraic, or sea weed. The partridges here are remarkable for having red feet ; and among its variety offish, is a curious sort, called Ormer, i. e. Oreille de mer. The Towns of St. Helier, and Sis. Aubin, stand both in St. Aubiris Bay. St. Helier is said to take its name from Elerius or Helier, a Holy man, who lived in this Island many centuries ago, and was slain by the Pagan Normans on their coming hither. He is mentioned among the Martyrs in the Martyrology of Coutance : his little Cell, with the stone bed, is still shown among the rocks ; and, in memory of him, a Noble Abbey of Canons Regular was founded in the little Island in this Bay, and annexed to Cherburg, in Normandy, in the reign of Henry the First, and suppressed as an Alien Priory. The Town of St. Helier, which stands at the Eastern extremity ofa long and high rocky hill, is a well built place, containing about 800 houses, mostly shops, and above 4000"], [107, "J E R inhabitants. The old Market-place, now the Square, in the centre is spacious, and surrounded with handsome houses, among which is the Cohue Royale, or Court of Justice: at the top is a Statue of George the Second, of bronze gilt : the Market is holden on Saturday, and is so much frequented, that it is equal to many Fairs in England. A commodious and elegant Market has lately been built, which attracts the curiosity, and commands the admiration of all foreigners. The Chapel de Notre Dame des Pas, or Of Our Lady of the Steps, is situate upon a rock, about a quarter of a mile South from the Town of St. Helier : it takes its appellation from an apparition of The Virgin Mary to some pious Priest, whose name is now forgotten : the print of The Virgin's Steps being, it is said, marked in the rock, which, that it might not incommode her feet, became soft as dough ; at present it is used as a Store-House. The Town of St. Aubin, at the West end of the Bay, is principally inhabited by merchants and mariners, whom the neighbourhood of the Port has invited hither : it is not half the size of St. Helier' s, though greatly increased of late. It has a good stone Pier carried far into the sea, where ships of considerable burden lie safe under the guns of the adjoining Fort. The Isle of St. Helier, more to the East in the same Bay, is in circuit nearly a mile, and is surrounded by the sea at or about every half flood. Upon the site of the ancient Abbey here, Elizabeth Castle is erected. This Castle was first projected in 1551, the fifth of Edward the Sixth; but the building did not commence until the year 1586, when, under the Regency ofthe Paulets, the Upper Ward was built, aud named Elizabeth Castle, in honour of that Queen : Charles the First enlarged, and Charles the Second, who was twice here, completed it : this was the last Fortress which held out for the King, being surrendered to the Parliament's forces in 1651, aster a long and valiant defence by Sir George de Carteret. It is now the residence ofthe Garrison, and occupies the whole Isle, from whence at low water is a passage, called The Bridge, half a mile long, formed of sand and stones. Mount Orgueil Castle, called also Gouray, from the neighbouring Village of that name, lies to the South of Rosel Harbour in the Bay of St. Catherine : it was a place of strength before the reign of Henry the Fifth, and bade defiance to the attempts ofthe French under the Constable de Guesclin in 1374, at the end ofthe reign of Edward the Third : it was repaired by Queen Elizabeth, and although now neglected, yet preserves an air of grandeur answering its name even in ruins : To this Castle the celebrated William Prynnb was sent prisoner, on the 5th of August 1637, where he remained until the 19th of November 1640 : he has"], [108, "J E R described and celebrated it in a copy of verses, intituled, \" A Poetical Descrip- tion of Mount Orgueil Castle in the Isle of Jersey, interlaced with some brief Meditations from its rocky, steep, and lofty situation.\" All the landing places and creeks round the Island are now fortified with batteries ; and several round Towers, with embrasures for small cannon, and loop-holes for musketry, are erected upon the Headlands. The Governor is the chief officer, who has the Custody of His Majesty's Castles, with the command of the Garrisons and Militia. The Civil Government is administered by a Bailiff, assisted by 12 Jurats. There is also an Assembly of the States ; this Assembly is convened by the Governor, or the Bailiff, and consists of himself and the Jurats, the Dean and Clergy, and the 12 High Constables. This Island, together with those of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, and their appendages, were parcel of the Duchy of Normandy, and were united to the Crown of England by the first Princes ofthe Norman line. The language of the Pulpit, and the Bar, is French, which is also that generally spoken by the people at large. They are governed by their own laws, which are for the most part the Ducal customs of Normandy, being collected in an ancient Book of Customs, intituled, \" Le Grand Coustumier.\" The King's Writ, or process from the Courts of Westminster, is of no force here; but his Commission is effectual. They are not bound by any common Acts ofthe Imperial Parliaments, unless particularly specified. All causes are originally determined by their own Officers, the Bailiff and Jurats ofthe Island ; but an appeal lies from them to the King and Council, in the last resort. It would, however, seem that some change is meditated ; from a Motion made by Mr. Abercrombie in The House of Commons, on Tuesday the 7th of July 1812 ; and who then stated, \" that the people of Jersey had, from the reign of King John, proved themselves at all times to have been truly loyal, and zealously attached to this Crown and Realm : \u2014 that so long ago as the reign of that Sove- reign, they had lived under a Constitution, then granted to them, under which they had been happy and contented : \u2014 that by this Constitution, the Governor was appointed by the King ; \u2014 the second Body in the State consisted of 12 Jurats, elected for life, by a majority of the Masters of Families, and those who paid direct taxes ; \u2014 the next Body consisted of 12 Clergymen, for the 12 Parishes in the Island, nominated by the Crown: \u2014 and 12 Constables, chosen in the same way as the Jurats. This was the Charter granted by King John, which had been confirmed in 1671 by King Charles the Second, and subsequently by his present Majesty, in 1771. That some months ago, a Commission had"], [109, "J E R been issued by The Privy Council, to inquire into the state of the Jurats, aud Commissioners had in consequence been sent to Jersey, which very much alarmed the people of that Island, under the idea that their Constitution was going to be subverted or changed ; and they wished, of course, to know the grounds on which this was to be done.\" Mr. Abercrombie then concluded by moving for \" A Copy ofthe Report ofthe Commissioners appointed to inquire into the mode of electing Jurats in the Island of Jersey :\" \u2014 which was negatived. Christianity was first planted here in the middle ofthe Sixth Century, and the Island made part ofthe See of Dol, in Bretagne : it is now within the Ecclesi astical Jurisdiction of the Diocese of Winchester, and is governed by a Dean ; a Dignitary who is nominated by the Sovereign, and whose office is holden by Patent under The Great Seal. The Twelve Parishes, which have each their proper Rector, are On the North, Trinity. St. John. St. Mary. On the West, St. Ouen. St. Peter. St. Brelade. On the South, St. Laurence St. Helier. St. Saviour; the Impropriate Tythes of which Parish are, by special grant from the Crown, annexed to The Deanry. On the East, St. Clement, Grouville. St. Martin. The Geneva -Discipline remained here, until the 21\u00b0 James I. ; at present the Liturgy ofthe Church of England, translated into French, is universally used. The Churches are very plain buildings, and the Communion Table is placed under the Pulpit. There is a Schoolmaster in every Parish, who is chosen by the Minister, Church-wardens, and principal Persons, and afterwards presented to The Dean for his license. And to supply the Church with able Divines from"], [110, "J E R among the Natives, there are two Public Free Grammar Schools, established at the two extremities ofthe Island, viz., St. Magloire, or Manlier, and St. Anas- tase ; each of which is designed for the instruction ofthe Youth of six Parishes. There are also Three Fellowships, in Pembroke, Jesus, and Exeter Colleges, in The University of Oxford, which belong to Jersey, and Guernsey, alter- nately : and founded by King Charles the First ; besides Three Scholarships for Jersey, and two for Guernsey, in Pembroke College, founded by Bishop Morley, in 1684. There were formerly many Druidical temples and altars in Jersey, some remains of which are still to be seen; and, in 1785 , a Druid temple was discovered upon the summit of a high rocky Hill, near the Town of St. Helier, completely covered with earth, and looking like a large tumulus or barrow ; and of which descriptions and plates are preserved in Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. xiii. pp. 384-388. The stones of this Temple were presented by The States of the Island to General Conway, then their Governor, and, in 1788, were placed in their original form in his Park in Berkshire, now Lord Malms- bury's. The Cromlechs are here called pouquelayes. Roman coins have also been dug up in this Island ; and there are the remains of a Roman Camp in the Manor of Dillamant. Besides The Abbey of St. Helier, there were the four Priories of Noirmont, St. Clement, Bonnenuit, and le Leek, and several Chapels, which are now mostly destroyed. These Islands have always been an object of desire to France ; in 1779, they attempted to achieve the conquest of Jersey, but without success : But, on the 6th of January 1781, a landing of 800 French was effected, under Baron de Rullecourt, who surprised the Garrison of St. Helier and the Lieutenant Governor, who was made to sign a capitulation to save the Town ; but Elizabeth Castle making resistance, Major Pierson, the next officer in seniority, attacked the French with so much impetuosity, that they were soon broken on all sides, the Baron himself mortally wounded, and the officer next in command obliged to surrender himself, and the whole party, prisoners of war. Major Pierson, to whom the deliverance of the Island was owing, unhappily fell in the moment of victory, when only 24 years of age ; to whose memory a handsome Monument was erected at the public expense in the church of St. Helier, and his valour commemorated by Paintings and Prints. Jersey gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Villiers. Those who know the value of remarks, resulting from a thorough investigation of a particular subject, will be highly gratified by the following excellent description of The Island of Jersey, in a Series of Letters"], [111, "J E R from Richard Valpy, D. D., F. S. A., Head Master of The Grammar School at Reading, to Arthur Young, Esq., F. R. S., and published in the Fourth and Fifth volumes of his \" Annals of Agriculture, and other useful Arts.\" \u2014 \" The wool, which is allowed duty free to the Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark, must, by an exclusive privilege, be shipped from Southampton. Hence arises a great intercourse with that town, which is most materially bene fited by it. The usual conveyance to the Islands is from that place. Some of the Packets, and even merchantmen, have excellent accommodations for pas sengers. From Southampton to Cowes, Portsmouth, and Yarmouth, the sur face ofthe sea is seldom ruffled, so as to prevent even those who are subject to the sea-sickness from enjoying the pleasure of that element. A more chearful aspect can scarcely be conceived, than that ofa company of passengers during that course. Even the tender sex join in the universal harmony ; and those who are ignorant ofthe succeeding change, bid defiance to the qualms which they have been taught to expect, and the general cry among them is, that the provi sions will not last during the whole voyage. The prospect here is beautiful beyond description. Vessels of all kinds, from the unwieldy collier and weather-beaten wine trader to the light skiff and painted pleasure-boat, cover the water, and animate the scene. In the front appear The Isle of Wight, and the Shipping at Spithead. On one side is seen The New Forest, interspersed with elegant villas. On the other the ruins of Netley Abbey, rising amidst the foliage of a fruitful country, throw an awful grandeur over the whole. Even the Boatman, ' if custom have not brazed him so, that he is proof and bulwark against sense,' passing by the venerable pile, ' Suspends his oar, and wonders what he feels. These ruins owe their preservation to a remarkable accident. Some years ago, a person who had begun to demolish them, in order to carry away the mate rials, saw in his dream a vision, warning him to forbear the intended sacrilege. In superstitious times this would have been an effectual impression on him, but in these days of liberal elevation of soul, esse aliquos manes nee pueri credunt. He proceeded with the demolition, and a heap of stones buried him in their fall. \u2014 Leaving The Needles, a ridge of rocks at the extremity of The Isle of Wight, so called from the slender form, and erect position of one of them, which lately fell into the sea, you enter the British Channel. By degrees the chalky cliffs of Albion, which hang tremendously over the waves, disappear, and nothing J VOL. ii. O"], [112, "J E R remains in sight but the seas and skies. In this situation, the sight of a vessel,. which in the river appeared only as an object of curiosity, now becomes the source of more interesting reflections. The sullen deportment of self-sufficiency, which many persons assume at the sight of their own species on shore, is now softened into very different sentiments. The sense of danger awakens the feel ings of benevolence. A mutual dependence is acknowledged to prevail ; and the origin of society is clearly ascertained. \u2014 The passage to the Islands is not without danger. The prodigious number of rocks, which are scattered in almost every direction from Cape la Hogue to Ushant, and seem as the appendages to the numerous Islands contained in that Bay, demand the general experience of the Sailer, and the particular knowledge of the Pilot. It is within the memory of many persons living, what consternation appeared in this Kingdom, at the loss ofthe Victory near The Caskets. A loss, abstractedly considered, of greater magnitude than that of the Royal George, though less alarming in its conse quences, from the difference in the relative situation of this country. \u2014 Arrived within a few miles of Jersey, a stranger will naturally think the voyage is at an end ; but the most difficult part is still to come. St. Helier s Town lies on the South ofthe Island, and consequently a long and tedious number of tacks must now bear him against that very wind, without which the voyage from England would have been very troublesome, if not impracticable. I would, therefore, advise those who are induced by sickness, fear, or a pressing exigence, to wish for a short passage, to be landed, if possible, on the North side ofthe Island. Nearly half the time, and more than that proportion ofthe danger, will be thus avoided. \u2014 When you land in any Port where a Custom-House is established, a set of gloomy faces enter and take possession ofthe Vessel, and of every part of the cargo and baggage. Till the latter has been formally examined, it is not per mitted to leave the Custom-House. \u2014 The landing in Jersey is unattended with these visitations. It is not necessary here to use any other precaution, than that of keeping a bateau de sante in readiness to visit every strange vessel, to make inquiries respecting the place from which it came, the state of its cargo, and to take the necessary measures to prevent the introduction of any infectious person or merchandise into the Island. \u2014 It is impossible to enter the Bay, which con tains the Town of St. Helier, without the utmost admiration of the beauties which it displays. The coast, from the Town Hill to Noirmont Point, a space of four miles, forms a crescent, which incloses a magnificent Scenery. At the distance of about a mile from each extremity are situate the Town of St. Helier"], [113, "JER on the East, and that of St. Aubin on the West. Equally distant from each Town, and vf ithin two miles of one another, Elizabeth Castle, and that called Tlie Tower, cover the entrance into both harbours. From Town to Town ex- tends a level plain of sand, which, at low water, discovers almost the whole of the Bay, opens at half flood a land communication with the castles, and affords a most agreeable walk or ride. The Forests of masts, which rise over the moles of three harbours, and the crouds, which flock to the piers at the approach ofa deck covered with passengers, cast a pleasing animation over the picture. The Hills, which bound the prospect, are covered with the richest variety. Orchards and meadows diffuse the verdure of the most luxuriant fertility on the vallies beneath, through which flow to the sea, at proper intervals, streams ofthe purest water. Elizabeth Castle, which in its present state has the appearance ofa little Town, is become since the invention of gunpowder, the principal fortification in the Island. The strength of this place was proved in 1651, by the long and Obstinate defence which it made, with only Three hundred men, against the pro- digious armament sent by the Regicides under the command of the gallant Blake, to subdue this Island. Near this Castle is seen a Rock, called The Hermitage, said to have been the solitary residence of the pious martyr, Helerius, who has given his name to the capital of the Island. St. Aubin'sFort, called The Tower, contains the best harbour in the Island, for the security of large ships. The water rises in it to the height of 28 feet; with its projected improvements it will be made a most convenient harbour. Those of St. Helier, and St. Aubin, are capable of receiving the largest trading vessels and privateers, that belong to the Island. The Town Hill commands both St. Helier's Town and Elizabeth Castle, and it is a matter of surprise that no fortifications were erected upon it, till some circumstances, which attended the invasion of Jersey,' in 1781, suggested the idea, or pointed the necessity, of building a Citadel upon- it, which is now considerably advanced. \u2014 The Island of Jersey made once, be- yond a doubt, a part ofthe Continent. Its distance from the coast of Normandy is less than six leagues. The passage is intersected with several ridges of rocks, some of which rise high above the sea, and even afford springs of pure water.* In Spring-tides many parts of the channel are scarcely covered, at low ebb, with* a sufficient depth of water for the smallest vessels. This opinion is founded on \u2022 more than analogical deduction. Exclusive ofthe similarity between the different strata, which compose the opposite hills on each side, and of the other argu ments, which theorists have advanced, many of the present appearances concur: O 2"], [114, "JER in establishing it. The sea makes rapid advances both on the shores of Jersey and of Normandy. St. Owens Bay on the Western side of the Island, it is more than probable, was once a Forest. At spring-tides trunks of large trees are discovered under the water standing where they grew, and roots have been found buried deep in the sand. Annual rents are still due, supposed to have been originally given to the Lord of the Manor, for the privilege of sending hogs to eat acorns in the wood. The space between Elizabeth Castle and the land, which is now covered every tide, is said to have once consisted of rich meadows. Nor are the advances of the Sea less rapid on the opposite coast of France. Within my observation, large tracts of land in that country have been covered with water. \u2014 The Island is nearly in the form of an oblong, one side of which, from East to West, is 13 miles in length, and the other six. The number of Inhabitants, as stated by Mr. Falle in the year 1731, was Twenty Thousand. But, if the prodigious increase of houses and of shipping be considered, the num ber must exceed Dr. Shebbeare's calculation, and fall little short of Thirty Thousand. The Town of St. Helier is superior in Population to some Cities in England, and the Country in general may almost be called a continued Village. The preservation of this, and the adjacent Islands, to the Crown of Great Bri tain, is an object of the first magnitude. They must be considered as the first foreign possession, which was ever attached to the English Government. The Inhabitants derive their origin from those hardy warriors of the North, who, after several invasions, obtained the complete possession of Normandy, and by one of those Revolutions, of which the daring spirit of enterprise on one side, and the want of political foresight on the other, have afforded many instances in barbar ous ages, accomplished, in one day, the conquest of England. Their attachment alone to this Nation during more than Seven hundred years, among the succes sive changes of dominion, which their brethren of Normandy underwent, and amidst the insurrections and revolutions, which have taken place in every other part of the British empire, entitles them to consideration and regard. The Majesty of the Kings of England is to them, sacred and inviolable. So convinced of this affection, and of their determined support of the cause of Loyalty, were the Fanatics under the Usurpation of Cromwell, that a day of public rejoicing and thanksgiving was appointed in this Kingdom at the news ofthe capture of Jersey, by a formidable army. This they considered as the fatal blow to expiring Loyalty. The last war has proved, that the ardour of their zeal is unabated. \u2014 Exclusive of these considerations, the importance of"], [115, "JER these Islands to this country, is a great reason of the protection, which they re ceive. Their benefit to England in time of peace shall be considered, under the article of their trade ; of what service they are in war, the inspection ofa map of France will sufficiently show. The English nation felt the effects of their bra very and enterprising spirit, after the death of Charles the First, in so severe a manner, that merchants from every quarter sent repeated complaints to the Ruling powers of the depredations committed on their trade by the \" Jersey Pyrates :\" So they denominated those, who acted under the authority ofthe law ful King, and who had once, according to Mr. Falle, planned a design of deli vering their captive Sovereign from Hurst Castle. But, when the ardour of hostility is encouraged by every advantage, which situation can give, it is no wonder if the French trade becomes the constant prey of these Islanders. Every fleet of merchantmen, that sails from the ports of France between St. Maloes and Dunkirk, is liable to be intercepted by the vigilance of Sixty privateers. They are enabled, by their knowledge of the coast and tides, to run, under fa vour ofthe night, into the very harbours ofthe French, and cut out their ships. The heroes of ancient Greece could not display more skill and intrepidity in their less honourable excursions against the neighbouring maritime states. \u2014 When to this number of privateers employed chiefly on the French coasts, is added a pro per squadron of English Frigates on the Jersey station, the trade of Normandy and Britany is severely exposed. The Bay of Boulay has been uniformly pointed out as the proper station for discovery and pursuit. In consequence of these advantages, Sir James Wallace, of the Experiment, in the year 1779, was enabled to give activity to his intrepid spirit, in the destruction of the fleet in the Bay of Cancale. If Boulay Bay is subject to inconveniences, every consideration demands an immediate remedy of them. \u2014 The great object of the French has ever been to have a Port in the Channel, for the reception of a Royal Fleet. From Brest to Dunkirk, they have at present no place of security for their ships of war. Various have been their endeavours to obviate this inconvenience ; but they have been uniformly unsuccessful. Could they obtain the possession of these Islands, the expensive preparations at Cherbourg, as uncertain in the end, as they are prodigious in the extent, would be unnecessary, and their intended service easily and effectually performed. Both Islands afford happy situations for harbours, from which they might range at pleasure, and in security, over the Channel, while the Fleets of England were detained by the winds. \u2014 To give an"], [116, "JER idea ofthe trade of the Island of Jersey, it is necessary to consider its exports, and imports. It will be easily conceived, that the former consist of very few articles. The most considerable arises from the Stocking: manufactures. Four thousand tods of Wool of 32/6s. are allowed to be yearly exported from England into Jersey, duty free ; and, having been finely combed, and perfectly dressed, are knit into stockings, gloves, and various other articles of dress. This is tho chief employment ofthe women. The dexterity and expedition with which they dispatch a pair of stockings are almost incredible. To them light and darkness are indifferent. A woman seen walking without her stocking in her hand is stigmatized with idleness. So attached are they to this employment, that they have appropriated to knitting the name of work (\u0153uvre.) The greatest part of the stockings manufactured in Jersey are exported to London, from whence they were sent to various parts of Europe. Their quality is so excellent, that few, who have experienced the use of them will willingly lay them aside. The other article of export, which deserves to be mentioned, is Cows. They are well known in the Southern Counties of England, under the denomination of Alderney, or Norman Cows. \u2014 Under the article of import may be included almost all the necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries of life. In the most plen tiful years, the Island yields little more than half the corn sufficient for the main tenance of its inhabitants. This will appear evident, if we consider that it does not contain the proportion of one acre of land to every individual. In the be<rin ning ofthe Seventeenth Century, the produce of the Island was more than ade quate to its consumption. But the increase of its population, and the conversion ofa great part ofthe arable land into orchards, render a supply from England absolutely necessary, even though bread is constantly made of barley for the use of labourers. \u2014 The great source of employment and of wealth to the Island, arises from the maritime trade. In pursuit of this object, they make frequent voyages to England, Ireland, France, Holland, Dantzic, and many other parts of Europe. They employ several vessels in the Logwood trade. But the New foundland Fishery has hitherto been their first consideration. In favourable times, no less than 60 vessels, carrying nearly 3000 men, sail from Jersey for this purpose. They dispose of their fish in the harbours of Spain and Italy, and their returns are in specie. This excellent branch of fair and open trade affords,. in time of war,- a number of hardy and experienced mariners to man the British fleets. \u2014 A Chamber of Commerce was instituted some years ago in Jersey, upon"], [117, "J O H extensive and liberal principles, and many important advantages have been de rived from it. Every Member of this Society pays yearly a few sons for every ton of Shipping which he employs ; and, in time of war, so much in the pound upon the net produce ofthe prizes, in which he is concerned. This last article has produced a considerable sum, which has been laid out in the Funds. Be sides the protection and improvement of trade, this revenue has for its object a decent provision for superannuated Seamen, or for those, who have re ceived any accident in the Merchant Service ; and, in particular cases, the sup port of their widows. Several other excellent regulations have made it worthy of imitation. \u2014 The trade ofthe Island is shackled by severe, and illiberal restric tions. It has lately been the wish of all parties in this country to admit their fellow Subjects, in different parts ofthe Empire, to a participation of Commer cial advantages, provided they do not tend to injure the manufactures, or weaken the resources of the mother country. The communication of Commercial pri vileges to the Islands, cannot, in the nature of things, but increase the resources of Great Britain, separately considered, in wealth and naval power. Coarse linen, cambrics, and a few trifling articles excepted, and these taken in pay ment for the woollens ofthe Islands, all the necessaries and luxuries of life are imported from England. All their money centres in England. That Loy alty and Patriotism, which have been before described, were they influenced by no other motives, would make them prefer every thing from England. All their fashions, without a single exception, are English. Their children (and this circumstance alone is worth a thousand arguments) are all educated in England.'' JETHOU, ISLE, v. SARK, ISLAND. JOHN O'GROATS HOUSE, in the Shire of Caithness ; and m the Parish of Canisbay. This memorable place owes its celebrity, perhaps, less to the circumstance of its local situation, at the Northern extremity ofthe Island, than to an event which it is not unpleasing to relate, as it inculcates an useful lesson of morality. In the reign of James the Fourth of Scotland, Malcolm, Gavin, and John de Groat, three brothers (and supposed to have been originally from Holland), arrived in Caithness, bringing with them a Letter written in Latin by that Prince, recommending them to the countenance and protection of his Subjects in this Shire. They purchased, or got possession of, the lands of Worse and Duncan's Bay, on the side ofthe Pentland Firth ; and, in a short time, by the increase of their families, eight different Proprietors of the name of Groat"], [118, "J O H possessed these lands among them. These eight Families having lived peace ably and comfortably in their several possessions, for a number of years, es tablished an annual meeting, to celebrate the Anniversary of the arrival of their Ancestors on that Coast. In the course of their festivity, on one of these occasions, a question arose respecting the right of taking the door, and sitting at the head of the table, and such points of precedency (each contending for the Seniority and Chieftainship), which increased to such a degree, as would probably have proved fatal in its consequences, had not John de Groat, who appears to have acquired great knowledge of mankind, interfered. He expa tiated on the comfort they had heretofore enjoyed, owing to the harmony which had subsisted between them ; \u2014 he assured them, that, as soon as they ap peared to quarrel among themselves, their neighbours, who had till then treated them with respect, would fall upon them, and expel them the County ; \u2014 he, therefore, conjured them by the ties of blood, and their mutual safety, to return quietly to their several homes ; \u2014 and he pledged himself, that he would satisfy them on all points of precedency, and prevent the possibility of such disputes, at their future Anniversary meeting; \u2014 they all acquiesced, and departed in peace. In due time, John de Groat, to fulfil his engagement, built a room, distinct from all other houses, of an octagon figure, with eight doors and win dows in it ; and having placed a table of oak ofthe same shape in the middle, when the next Anniversary meeting took place, he desired each of them to enter by his own door, and to sit at the head of the table ; he taking him self the seat that was left unoccupied. By this ingenious contrivance, any dispute, with respect to rank, was prevented, as they all found themselves on a footing of equality, and their former harmony and good humour were restored. The Building was then named John o' Groat's House ; and, though nothing re mains but the foundations of this edifice, the place still retains the name, and deserves ever to be remembered for the good intentions, and good sense which gave it origin. JOHN'S-HAVEN, in the Shire of Kincardine ; and in the Parish of Ben holme. It is 4 m. S. S. W. from Bervie. This was formerly a very considerable Fishing Town, on the German Ocean ; but, from various circumstances, it has lately been on the decline. It has a small Pier, by means of which vessels may load and unload at anytime ofthe tide, in favourable weather: in ordinary tides, the depth ofthe Harbour is from 10 to 12 feet, but it might be further increased at no gn_at expense, as the bottom is a soft marly rock. The trade here chiefly"], [119, "J O H consists in importing coals, and exporting grain. A manufacture of Sail-cloth has been established by a Company of Dundee merchants. Two Schools, one for Boys, and the other for Girls, are kept here. It is subject to the Port of Montrose. The Resident Population of this Village, in 1811, was 839. JOHN'S HEAD, ST., v. CANISBAY. JOHN'S, ST., CLAUCHAN, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; and in the Parish of Dairy. This is a large, and increasing Village, the property of The Earl of Galloway, wdio has feued it on very advantageous terms to the feuer. A stone is preserved here with great care, and shewn to strangers, called St. John's Chair : And the Church of Dairy having been consecrated to St. John the Apostle, both the adjacent Village, and the Chair, assumed his name. JOHNSTON, v. LAURENCE KIRK. JOHNSTON, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in bad repair: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Earl of Hopetoun, as Curator at Law to The Marquis of Annandale : The Church was built in 1733. It is in the Presbytery of Lochmaben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 740, and, in 1811, was 904. It is 6\\ m. N. from Lochmaben. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, except at one place, where it extends to 6 miles. It is situate on the Western bank of the river Alnnan, which sometimes over-flows, and does considerable damage ; there the soil is light and sandy, but the higer lands are generally a deep moss or clay : the greater part, however, is rich and fertile, and by the judicious system of The Earl of Hopetoun, to whom the whole Parish belongs, agriculture has lately been much improved. The climate is very rainy, but not unhealthy. Here are two Parochial Schools, one in the East, and the other towards the West end of the Parish: they are both for teaching English, and arithmetic : the Salary of one of them is 300 merks, and that ofthe other 150 merks ; together with School-fees. The fuel commonly made use of is Peat, and Turf, which are in great abundance ; but, from the uncertainty of the weather in getting them home dry, coals are brought both from Douglas, and Sanquhar. Lime is 18 miles distant. The great Road through this Parish, from Moffat to Dumfries, is in good repair : statute labour is commuted : and there are no turn pikes. St. Anne's Bridge, over the Kinnel water, was built by The Earl of Hopetoun, in 1782. Game, of various kinds, are abundant. This Parish has the honour of having given birth to Dr. Rogerson, first Physician to the late vol. ii. P"], [120, "J U R Empress Catherine of Russia; his father was one ofthe tenants of The Mar- quis of Annandale, and rented\u201eone half of the farm of Loch- Brew, in the South extremity ofthe Parish, where the Doctor was born: the other half was at the same time rented by William Halliday, another farmer, whose son, Dr. Matthew Halliday, was likewise one of Her Imperial Majesty's Physicians. The Castle of Lochwood, now in ruins, was formerly the residence of The Noble Family of Annandale : it is situate in the North end ofthe Parish, commanding a very extensive prospect, especially towards the South, and is said to have been built in the Fourteenth Century : it appears to have been a place of great strength, having prodigiously thick walls, and being surrounded with almost impassable bogs and marshes. The Parish is supposed to take its name, from the circumstance of its having been the immemorial residence and property of the Ancient and Illustrious family of Johnston, who were the principal, and almost sole proprietors, and long ago were the only inhabitants of it, and ances tors ofthe late Marquis of Annandale ; the title of which is now dormant. JOLLY, The Croft of, v. G AIRLOCH. JOPPA, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of Dudingston. It is pleasantly situate on the Firth of Forth, at the distance of 4 m. E. from Edinburgh. JURA, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Islay, and Shire of Argyle: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, by decreet of locality, on the 17th of November 1802, Avas settled at the Teind of the Parish as then stated, being \u00a3139.. 6.. 9., which includes \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements, and \u00a350. to an Assistant in the Island of Collonsay \u25a0 The whole Teinds of the Parish were valued, except the Teinds of Killmory, and others, belonging to The Earl of Breadalbane, which were stated in 1798, at \u00a315. Sterling, the rent being \u00a375. : Whether the rental of His Lordship's lands in this Parish are so much increased as to afford an additional fund for Stipend, does not appear : the manse, and offices, are in bad condition : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Duke of Argyle : The Church is in indifferent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Cantyre, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Popula- tion of this Parish, in 1801, was 1202, and, in 1811, was 1157. It is 4 m. S. from the Point of Craignish, on the Main, to which there is a Ferry. This Island is about 32 miles in length, and, on an average, about 7 miles in breadth : it is the most rugged of the Western Isles, being composed chiefly of huge rocks, piled upon each other in the utmost disorder, naked, and incapable of cultivation."], [121, "J U R A ridge of lofty mountains runs from South to North, along the West side ; they are four in number, and are termed The Paps of Jura, one of them being elevated 2600 feet above the level of the sea, and are conspicuous at a very great distance. The West side of the Island is not fit for cultivation ; it is wild and rugged, intersected by many torrents, which come rushing down from the mountains ; and has been deemed so inhospitable, that no person chooses to fix his habitation in it. All the inhabitants live on the East side ; where, along the margin of the sea, the grounds are pretty level ; but, at a little distance from the shore, there is a gradual ascent. The soil along the coast is thin and stony, and very ill cultivated. It is the property of Archibald Campbell, Esq., of Jura, or Ardfin. The air is pure and salubrious, but subject to heavy rains. Game, of various kinds, are in great plenty. There are two sine Harbours upon the Eastern side ; that to the South, is called Tlie Small Isles ; the other to the North, The Lowland-Man's Bay: they are within a few miles of each other. The course of the tides along the coast of Jura, particularly in the Sound of Scarba, and in that of Isla, is very rapid and dangerous : the famous G ulf of Corry- Vrekan being between Jura and Scarba, and is so called from Breacan, son of a king of Denmark, who is said to have perished in it. There are several barrows, and duns ; and near the harbour of Small Isles, are tlffe remains of a very considerable encampment. Iron-ore, manganese, slate, and a very fine kind of sand used in the manufacture of glass, are in great abundance. The Gaelic is the only language spoken in the Island. Here is a Parochial School ; and also a School, established by The Society for propagating Christian Know- ledge, with a Salary of \u00a315. Fuel is expensive. An excellent line of road, 16 miles in length, has been made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Com- missioners, between the Ferries of Lagg, and Feoline : the former connecting it with the Keills road and Boating-place, and the latter with Port-Askaig in the Island of Islay. See, Islay, Island. By a Memorial presented to The Parlia mentary Commissioners, in the month of June 1810, by the Proprietors ofthe Island of Jura, and the adjacent Islands, it appears, \" That the Memorialists understanding that it is in contemplation of The Commissioners to make some roads on a smaller scale than those hitherto undertaken under their authority, they are desirous of submitting their wishes upon this subject, so far as the Island of Jura, and the adjacent Islands, are concerned. They consider that a road of this description, from the termination ofthe road now making at Lagg, to Kenuachtrach, at the Northern Point of Jura, from which there is a Ferry to P2"], [122, "J U R the Main-land, at the Point of Craignish (where a very good carriage road is already made, which leads to the Kintraw and Killmelfort road, and all the other roads in the Shire of Argyle) would be highly useful ; and, if the expense were such as they could meet, they would gladly contribute the moiety of it. By inspection of Arrowsmith's Map of Scotland, it will be seen that the Island of Jura extends along Tlie Sound of that name which divides it from the Continent, stretching from the point of Craignish, on the Main-land ofthe Shire of Argyle, Southwards for about thirty miles ; and that the extensive and populous Islands of Islay, Collonsay, and Oronsay, are at the South, and the Islands of Scarba, and a number of other Islands, are at the North end of Jura, which is opposite to the West entrance to the Crinan Canal; and, as it is situate between Islay, Collonsay, and Oronsay, and the nearest part ofthe Main-land, the whole inter course from these Islands to each other, and with the Main-land, must all necessarily go through Jura. Hence, the advantage and utility of having a good road from the North to the South end of Jura, must be apparent. That the Population of these several Islands is upwards of 15,000 Souls, aud the trade and intercourse which is carried on with each other, and also with the Main, is very considerable ; but, from the want of a good road to the North end of the Island, where the Ferry to the Main is narrowest and most accessible, accidents frequently happen to the Inhabitants of these Islands, who are under the neces sity of exposing themselves, and their produce, in small boats along the coast, for the want of this road. So sensible were the Memorialists of the advantages that would result to these Islands, by rendering the Communication through Jura more easy, that they some years ago applied for, and obtained from The Commissioners the usual aid, for making a road from the Ferry of Feoline, opposite to Islay, to the Ferry of Lagg, opposite to Keills, on the Main-land, which is nearly one half the length of the Island ; and they would at that time have applied to have it extended the whole length ofthe Island North to Kenu achtrach, had they not been afraid that the expense would be so great, that they considered themselves unable to bear even a moiety of it : But, as they conceive the Bridle Roads now proposed, will not exceed nine or ten feet in width, and will consequently not only be less expensive, but also answer all the purposes required, they feel themselves called upon to make the present application to have the proposed tract surveyed. The road to Lagg, when finished (now com pleted), will no doubt be of great advantage to these Islands ; but without it is continued to the Ferry of Kenuachtr ach, by the Bridle Road now proposed,"], [123, "J U R the Islands at the North end of Jura will not feel the advantages of it ; and, as the Ferry from Kenauchtrach to the Main -land is about one -half narrower than the Lagg Ferry, and more easily crossed, in consequence of several small Islands which run across The Sound and afford much shelter, it would remove, in a great measure, the insular disadvantages which these Islands labour under, as this Ferry would almost at all times be accessible ; whereas the Ferry at Lagg, from being wider and more exposed, is often not passable. That if this road were made, the communication from the South to the North end of the Island would be complete, which would not only much facilitate the intercourse between the adjacent Islands and the Main -land, and also with each other, but would open up a large extent of country well calculated for improvements. Besides these local advantages, this road would be of considerable utility in a National point of view ; for, if the road is made to Kenuachtrach, it is in con templation to convey the Mails to these Islands by this Ferry, which would be done three times a week, in place of only once by the present conveyance of a Pacquet : which circumstances would not only increase the revenue of the Post- Office, by multiplying the correspondence, but would tend much to the trading interest of these Islands, as well as to the Ports of Clyde, Liverpool, &c, as it would facilitate the intercourse between the Masters and Owners of Vessels belonging to these Ports, coming from the Baltic, West Indies, and America, which frequently put into the anchoring places along the East side of Jura, by putting it in their power to give early notices of their arrivals. It may likewise be noticed, that, since the road to Port-na- Haven, on the West coast of Islay, has been completed, people going to the North of Ireland frequently pass through Jura, and from thence through Islay to Port-na-Haven, from which the Passage to Ireland is not more than seven leagues. Hence this road, in many instances, would form a convenient and short mode of communication between the Western parts of Scotland and the North of Ireland.\" The Commissioners have directed this line of road to be surveyed (about twelve miles in length), and it will doubtless be carried into effect accordingly. JURBY, in The Isle of Man : The Church is situate upon an elevated Promontory, called Jurby Point. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1792, was 713. It is 10 m.

This Parish is 8 miles in length, and from 2\\ to 3 miles in breadth. The soil is, in general, light, dry, and fertile, especially in showery seasons : on the banks of the rivers Nith, and Scarr, are some fine holms, of a deep rich loam : but more than one-third of the surface is hilly, which affords excellent sheep pasture. There is a considerable extent of natural wood, and several extensive planta tions of fir have lately been made. The climate is rather moist and damp. The Roads are in bad repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with a free house, and some trifling School-fees. The greater part ofthe Parish is but indifferently provided with fuel, owing to the distance from the mosses : coals are brought from Sanquhar, at the distance of 14 miles, which are very expensive. Lime-stone is abundant, particularly on the estate of Barjarg; where a Village was built by the late Dr. Hunter.

The Village of Old Keith is of ancient date, having been partly feued by the predecessors of the Family of Forbes, and partly feued by the Ministers, and stands upon the glebe : this Village is greatly on the decline, and almost a ruin. \u2014 About the year 1750, the late Lord Findlater divided a barren Muir, and feued it out in small lots, ac cording to a regular plan, still adhered to ; on which there now stands a large, regular, and thriving Village, called New Keith ; the feus contain 30 feet in front by 70, at a feu-duty of 10s. per annum : this Village is the residence of all the Manufacturers of note in the Parish : it enjoys the benefit of a well frequented, and plentifully supplied, and cheap, weekly Market : it has also four annual Fairs, that on the Second Thursday in September having been long established, and was formerly the general mart for Merchant goods from Aberdeen to Kirk wall ; and it is still the best frequented Market in the North, for black Cattle and Horses: a General Post-Office is also established here, and the Mail- Coach runs through the Village thrice a week, on its way from Aberdeen to Inverness. \u2014 Soon aster the commencement ofthe Village of New Keith, the late Lord Fife begun to erect a Village on the North side of the Parish, and then feued out a considerable tract of land, called The New Town of New Mill, to"], [127, "K E I lo distinguish it from another Village near it, called New Mill, which is also his Lordship's property, but was never feued : This New Town contains a few wea vers, who are the only manufacturers ; the majority of the Inhabitants being very poor people, who have fixed their abode there, for the convenience of the land and moss. \u2014 The Old Town, called New Mill, is thinly inhabited. \u2014 This Parish is about 6 miles long, and as many broad, being nearly circular. It lies in the middle of a large Strath, called Strath Isla, contracted Strr/la, from the little river Isla that runs through it: and contains a tract of as close, extensive, and fertile a field of arable ground, as is to be found in any Valley in the North: the prevailing soil is loam, and clay; the rest of it, is light. The Climate is moist and cold, and the Seasons are late. There are six Heritors ; one of whom only, Mr. Stewart, of Birkenbum, is resident. The principal branches of ma nufacture carried on here, are flax-dressing, spinning, and weaving : a Bleach field has lately been established on the banks of the Isla, on an extensive scale ; and a Tannery, and a Distillery, are also carried on with success. The Tenants are subjected to very few Services, and these few are seldom exacted. The Parish School has long been famous, and is now in a very prosperous state, being conducted by a Gentleman of great merit, and of the most indefatigable application : besides the usual Salary, and Perquisites, he enjoys annually 300 merks Scotch from a mortification, paid by the Laird of Braco. This Town has the advantage of different Turnpike roads to the coast. There are the remains of several Druidical circles ; and here are- several Chalybeate springs, which are said to equal the mineral water of Peterhead. A little below the old Village of Keith, the river Isla precipitates itself over a pretty high rock, and forms a fine Cascade, called The Linn of Keith. A part of this Parish, called Allanbui, is situate in the Shire of Elgin. KEITH, or KEITH MARSHAL, in the Shire of Hadington : an ancient Rectory, now united to the Parish of Humbie. It is 8 m. SW. b. S. from Had ington. The Barony of Keith, together with Inch-Keith and other Lands, were given, along with the office of Hereditary Great Marshal of Scotland, by King Malcolm, to one Robert, as a reward for killing with his own hand, Camus the King and Champion ofthe Danes, at the battle of Barry, in the year 1010. From these lands Robert took the surname of Keith, and they remained in the pos session ofthe family, until they were sold for the purpose of affording aid to General Leslie. The ruins of Keith- House, a seat of The Earls Marshal, are noticed, for the extent and elegance which they still exhibit : and, it is said. vol. h.

KEITH-HALL, anciently MONTKEGGIE, in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, with two-thirds ofthe ancient Parish of Kinkell united, in 1754 ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was nearly 89 bolls of meal and bear, and \u00a343.. 13.. 5. in money : the glebe contains the legal extent: Patron, The Earl of Kintore : The Church, and manse, were built in 1771 and 1772, at^a place in the centre ofthe District, called Legate; so named, because the Pope's Legate staid there, at a small Chapel, which still retains the appel lation of Monk's Hillock, the night before the great battle of Harlaw ; as Legate's Den, in the Chapelry of Garioch, was the place, where he in vain attempted to reconcile the contending parties. It is in the Presbytery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801, wras 853, and, in 1811, was 883. It is 1 m. N. E. from Inverury. The United Par ishes contain nearly 11,000 acres. Along the banks ofthe rivers Don and Ury, which are subject to frequent inundations, the soil is abundantly fertile ; but, towards the East, it is very unproductive. The air is moist, but salubrious, ex cept near the marshy grounds. Fuel is expensive. The knitting of stockings is the principal manufacture here. The rents are paid in oat-meal, and bear. Several services are exacted. Keith-Hall, the Seat of The Earl of Kintore ; and Balbithan, the Seat of General Gordon, are fine Mansions, surrounded with extensive and flourishing Plantations. There are three Druidical circles ; and a multitude of small cairns on the muir of Kinmnck, are said to point out the place of a dreadful engagement between the Scots and Danes. The famous modern Latin Poet, Arthur Johnston, M. D., was born at Caskiebean, which he celebrates : and also mentions a curious fact, viz., that the shadow of the hioh mountain of Bennochie, which is distant about 6 miles, extends to the house of Caskiebean at the Equinox ; and hence the Gaelic name Caskiebean, i. e. The Shadow ofthe Hill. In the Church-yard are interred Scrimgeour, the Hio*h Constable of Dundee, and many ofthe Nobility who fell in the battle of Harlaw.

This is the fine Seat of the Ancient and noble Family of Erskine, Earl of Kellie, Viscount Fenton, Baron Dirlton, Premier Vis count of Scotland, and one of the Sixteen Representative Peers for North Bri tain, in the Imperial Parliament. The first ofthe Noble family of Erskine, Earl of Kellie, was Sir Alexander Erskine, of Gogar, third son of John, Twelfth Lord Erskine, and Fifth Earl of Marr, by Lady Margaret Campbell, daughter of Archibald, second Earl of Argyle. Kellie, from whence the title is taken, is a District ofthe Shire of Fife, which was anciently called, Kellie-Shire.

It is in the Presbytery of Kirkcud bright, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Royal Borough of New Galloway) was 778, and, in 1811, was 941. It is f m. N. W. from New Galloway. This Parish is about 15 miles in length, and at the North end, 6 miles in breadth, gradually diminishing till it terminates in a point, at the junction ofthe rivers Ken and Dee. The surface is hilly : along the banks ofthe rivers, the soil is partly a rich clay, and, on the higher grounds, is partly thin and dry, but when properly cultivated, is very Q2"], [130, "K E L abundant. There are six Lochs, besides Loch Ken, which is 5 miles in length, and from half a mile to three quarters of a mile in breadth : Loch Ken and Loch Dee (though sometimes considered as two) are but one Loch, that is con tinued 10 miles long ; they abound with pike of an enormous size, trout, perch, eels, and salmon : they are also navigable, and boats of consider able burden are frequently employed in bringing up marl from the Carling- Work Loch, and carrying down fir, ash, and oak-wood, with which this hilly country abounds. The air is healthful. Black, and red game are in plenty. In all parts ofthe Parish, except in the neighbourhood of New Galloway, peats are abundant, of easy access, and of good quality. The Roads are tolerable. The Bridges are in good repair: one of which, of two arches, over the large burn of Paharrow, is the private and patriotic donation of Quintin Maclurg, a Tailor, who resided in that neighbourhood. Near the summit ofa high ridge of Mountains, called The Kells Range, is a huge stone, which is so poised as to be moveable with a very small exertion of force : the particular hill on which it is situate, is called Mull\u00e6, and the stone itself is named The Mickle Lump, or The Laggan Stone : near it, is a small pool of water, which covers about half a rood of land: the dimensions of. this stone are, its greatest length 8 f . 9 in., its height 5 f. 1-| in., and its circumference 22 f. 9 inches. Mr. Grose has pre served two views of it. Glenlee Park is the -elegant seat of Lady Miller, relict ofthe late Sir Thomas Miller, Lord President Glenlee. The Castle of Dind cuck, which is now in ruins, has all the appearance of having once been a place of great strength. Thomas Gordon, the Translator of Tacitus, and Author of the Independent Whig, was a Cadet ofthe Family of Kenmure, and born in this Parish ; and not at Shermers, in the Parish of Balmaclellan, as is generally sup posed.

There are twelve High Markets in the year, two be fore and one after the term days of Whit-Sunday, and Martinmas ; the two first are for hiring male and female Servants, the last is generally employed by the servants in mirth, and in laying out their wages before they enter into ser vice again : on these days, the concourse of people being great, and beyond what is known on the like occasions in any part of Scotland, it is productive of considerable profits to the Shopkeepers : the other six High Market days are in March, and the end of Autumn ; the former for purchasing horses for summer work, such as, driving lime, coals, &c. ; which being over, they sell ihe horses again before winter sets in, owing to the high price of fodder at that season. There are three Fairs in the Parish, including St. James's, which is holden on the 5th of August ; the other two being holden in the Town, viz., on the 10th of July, and the 2nd of November. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate at the confluence of the rivers Teviot, and Tweed, on an ex tensive plain, bounded on all sides by rising grounds, which are covered with plantations, and is much and deservedly admired for the beauty of its scenery : this is particularly noticed by Patten, who accompanied the Lord Protector, Somerset, into Scotland. During the Border Wars, which long spread deso lation and misery over this country, Kelso was thrice burned down by the Eng lish ; it was also reduced to ashes in the year 1686, by an accidental fire ; and nearly so by another, about 68 years ago. It seems to have derived its ancient name of Calc-How, from a Calcarious Eminence, that is conspicuous in the middle of the Town, and which is still called, The Chalk Heugh : the Monks also denominated the Seal of the ancient Monastery, Sigillum Monasterii de Calco. The Duke of Roxburgh, as Lay Proprietor of the lands and abbey of Kelso, is Lord ofthe Manor : His Grace's Ancestor, Sir Robert Ker, of Cess ford, obtained this grant from James the First of England, in 1605, on the for feiture of Francis Earl of Bothwell, Admiral of Scotland, when the Town was erected into a Burgh of Barony. It is governed by a Baron Baillie, appointed by The Duke, and fifteen Stent-Masters, of whom the Duke nominates seven ; the other eight consist of the Preses of the Merchant Company, and Deacon Convener, and the Deacons ofthe five following Corporations of Hammermen, Skinners, Shoemakers, Tailors, and Weavers ; together with the Deacon ofthe Butchers, although they are not incorporated : these, under the authority ofthe Baron Baillie, have the power of imposing a stent or tax upon the inhabitants,"], [132, "K E L according to their circumstances, to defray the necessary expenses of the Burgh. The principal trade carried on here, is the manufacture of woollen cloth ; and the dressing of sheep and lamb skins. It is but justice, due to merit, to make particular mcntiou of Mr. John Gibson, the Optician, as a man of genius, who has made several improvements in optical instruments. Here is a public Sub scription Library, which contains a valuable collection of good books; anda Dispensary, conducted upon the most humane and generous plan. This Dis trict formerly consisted of the three separate Parishes of Kelso, Maxwell, and St. James: it is of an irregular triangular figure, and contains from five to six thousand acres. The land, in this part of the country, is all measured by the English acre. The soil, for a considerable tract on both sides of the river Tweed, and in that part ofthe Parish which lies between the Tweed, and the Teviot, is in general composed of a deep rich loam, upon a bottom of gravel, producing early and luxuriant crops: in the North West extremity, and in the South, the soil is a wet clay, and the crops are much later. There was formerly a hand some Bridge over the Ticeed, which was washed away in 1798, but it has since been re-built : there is a Bridge also over the Teviot, a little above its junction with the Ticeed. Kelso is a place of great gayety ; it is often the seat of The Caledonian Hunt : and its Races, which are holden upon a Moor about 4\\ miles distant, in the Parish of Eckford, called Cavertown Edge, are well attended. It has been the scene of many transactions of importance ; it was here that a mutual friendship was conceived between Henry the Third of England, and Alexander the Third of Scotland, who with their Queens and an attend ance of the Nobility of both Kingdoms, met each other with the utmost cordiality. In 1460, homage was paid to James the Third at Kelso by the Noblemen and Gentry on his Coronation in this Town, which was performed with the usual solemnity. The noble Palace of The Duke of Roxburgh, called Fleurs, is at a short distance from hence, presenting a front of considerable extent, with immense woods on each side. In the vicinity of this superb Mansion, is a small, but elegant Seat ( Spring wood Park), of Sir George Douglas, Bart., whose pleasure grounds are laid out with great taste and neatness. The Castle of Roxburgh, situate on an eminence of considerable extent near the confluence of the Teviot and Tweed, and about a mile South-West from Kelso, is remarkable for the thickness and solidity of the remaining walls. The numerous struggles, which the two Kingdoms had, for the possession of this Fortress, render its history of more importance than that of any other near the Borders. According-"], [133, "KEL to Mr. Camden, it was anciently called Marchidun, from its standing on the Marches. It frequently changed masters ; and, in the reign of Henry the Sixth, was in the possession of that Monarch. James the Second of Scotland hav ing laid siege to this Castle, his army made themselves masters of it, and in a great measure destroyed the works, and reduced it to ruins ; but, previous to the victory, the King was killed by the bursting of a piece of ordnance. A Holly tree is said to stand on the spot where this happened, on the North side of the river Ticeed, and a little below Fleurs. Near this Tree, stood a large Village, which, from a Cross that remained within these few years, was generally called Hie Fair Cross. But the probable origin of the Name, as it has been handed down, though not generally known, is this : James the Second's Queen, having very soon reached the place where the lifeless body of her husband laid, is re ported to have exclaimed, \" There lies The Fair Corpse,\" whereupon it received the name of Fair Corpse or Corse ; and, in process of time, the change from Corse to Cross was easily effected. From this period the Castle has remained in ruins, although it was in some degree repaired, by the Lord Protector Somerset, in the reign of Edward the Sixth ; and who was so intent upon this work, that he laboured at it with his own hands two hours every day whilst it was going on ; and his example was followed by most ofthe principal men of his army ; the place was accordingly made defensible in six days, and a Garrison of three hundred Soldiers and two hundred pioneers was left in it, under the command of Sir Ralph Bulmer. The adjoining territory from the old Castle and Town, is called The Sheriffdom of Roxburgh, of which the Family of Douglas are Hereditary Sheriffs, and usually denominated Sheriffs of Teviotdale. Upon the Estate at Wooden, there are the vestiges of an ancient tumulus; and near a small rivulet on the same Estate, skeletons have been discovered, inclosed in stone coffins. Here are two established Schools, one for Latin, and the other for English. The Grammar Master has a Salary of \u00a322. per annum, a House, and Garden, and 5s. per quarter for each of his Pupils. The office of Session Clerk, is generally annexed to his employment, which is worth about \u00a312. a year. The English Master's Salary is \u00a35..13..0., and 2s. 6d. and 3s. 6d. per quarter from his Scholars, according to what they are taught. There are also four other English Schools, one of which is kept by the Clerk of the Chapel, and is in good reputation. Besides these, there are Schools for the instruction of Girls ; and, a School of Industry has been instituted, which does credit to the founders. Here are also three Benefit Societies. A considerable"], [134, "KEL part of The Abbey of Kelso, formerly an immense edifice, still remaius, and exhibits a venerable monument of that taste for magnificence, which distinguished ancient times. It was built by David the First, when Earl of Northumberland, and before his accession to the throne of Scotland, who had a predilection for the Order of Monks of the Tyronenses, whom he first planted at Selkirk : but that situation being found to be inconvenient, he removed them to Roxburgh, in 1 126 ; and finally translated them to Kelso, where, in 1128, he founded for them a superb Church, and other buildings in the Saxon style. This Abbey was dedicated to The Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist : its privileges were very considerable, and its endowments liberal ; all of which were confirmed by Pope Innocent the Second, whodied in the year 1143. The Monks were exempted from toll, and leave was granted to them and the Abbot, to receive the Sacraments of the Church from any Bishop they pleased, in Scotland and Cumberland. The Abbot was allowed to wear a Mitre, to make use of other Pontifical distinctions, and to be present at all general Councils. It is related, that this Order was particularly attentive to Agriculture, and that, besides Husbandmen, they maintained within their Monastery' all kinds of Mechanics, whose profits were deposited in the common stock, for the support of the Order. The Revenues of this House amounted, on its suppression, to \u00a32000. Scotch per annum, chiefly arising from money payments. Its last Abbot was James Stuart, natural son to King James the Fifth, who died in 1559 ; after him the Cardinal de Guise was nominated Abbot by Mary of Lorrain, but never obtained pos session ; it being granted to Francis Earl of Bothwell, upon whose forfeiture, as has been already observed, King James the Sixth bestowed it on Sir Robert Ker, in 1605; to whose immediate descendant, His Grace The Duke of Rox burgh, it now belongs, and who also enjoys the title of Earl of Kelso.

It is in the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Castle-Douglas, and Rhon-House or Kelton- Hill) was 1905, and, in 1811, was 2263. It is 1\u00b1 m. S. from Castle-Douglas. This Parish contains about 9500 square acres. The soil is exceedingly various, and generally thin ; but, when properly cultivated, is very fertile; and, in the North end of the Parish, there is abundance of the finest shell marl. The air is dry, and salubrious. Here are three Schools, but they are all very poorly endowed ; one of them having- only an annual Salary of \u00a32.. 8.. 9., another of \u00a32..10..0., and the principal one of about \u00a315..0..0. Sterling, exclusive of the School fees, which are very low here. Fuel is expensive. The great Military road, from Dumfries to Port-Patrick, runs through the Parish for the space of four miles. One great obstacle to improvements here, is the high multures. The staple commodity is black cattle, and sheep. See, Castle-Douglas, and Rhon-House. KELTON-HILL, v. RHON-HOUSE. KELTOWN, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Caerlaverock. This is an improving Village, situate on the Eastern bank of the river Nith, at the distance of 3 m. S. from Dumfries. Here is a Harbour for vessels of from 30 to 90 tons burden, in which the tide rises 15 feet, at the full and change of the Moon. A considerable trade is carried on from hence in the exportation of grain, and potatoes ; and in the importation of lime, and coals from Cumberland ; and from Liverpool, of such groceries as are consumed in the neighbourhood. The Nith abounds with fish, of various kinds. KELTY, in the Shire of Kinross ; and in the Parish of Cleish. It is 21 m. N. N. W. from Edinburgh. This is a small, but improving Village, with a bridge over the Burn of the same name. A General Post-Office is established here. KEMBACK, in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was about \u00a3180.

This Parish contains about 1850 acres ; of which, VOL. II. R"], [136, "KEN upwards of 1500 are arable. The soil is various, but generally fertile, especially on the banks ofthe river Eden, which bounds it on the North. The climate is healthy. Free-stone is abundant: and on the estate of Blebo, a vein of lead ore was discovered in 1722, which was worked for some time, but given up on ac count of the great expense attending it. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with a School-house, and dwelling, and the usual School fees. The principal Seats are Kembach, the property of John Macgill, Esq., and Blebo, of Miss Bethune.

This Parish is about 4\\ miles in length, and nearly 3 miles in breadth. The surface is hilly, a chain of little hills running through it, called The Kembs. The soil is, for the most part, a light mould, very stony, and lying upon a bed of sand ; but, on the banks of the Don, there are some haughs ofa fine rich loam. Peats are the common fuel. The public roads are in good repair. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, the interest of some legacies, and a rood of land. Kemnay, the Seat of Mr. Burnett, is delightfully situate on the banks of the Don, and is surrounded with parks and pleasure grounds, laid out with great taste. KEMPLAW, CASTLE, v. DUNDONALD. KEMP'S CASTLE, or KAIM'S CASTLE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Muthil. Here was a small, but strong Roman post ; being situate on an eminence, and commanding an extensive prospect. General Roy has preserved a plan of it. pi. xxxi. KEN ED AR, v. KING EDWARD. KENEDAR, in the Shire of Elgin : an ancient Parish, now constituting part of the Parish of Drainy : The vestiges of the old Church are still to be seen in the Church-yard here ; and adjacent to it, are the remains of an old Palace or Castle belonging to the Bishop of Moray, where he resided before the Castle of"], [137, "KEN Spynie was built. It is 6 m. N. b. E. from Elgin. This was formerly the seat of the Treasurer of St. Andrew's. KEN-LOCH-EW, v. GAIRLOCH. KENMORE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is large, handsome, and commodious : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent, to which is annexed a small farm, which the Incumbent enjoys by the beneficence ofthe Breadalbane Family, at the yearly rent of 5s. : Patron, The Earl of Breadalbane : The Church is ex ceedingly neat, and plain. . It Is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (includ ing the village of Stronfernan) was 3346, and, in 1811, was 3624. It is 6 m. SW. b. W. from Aberfeldy. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth, stretching along both sides of Loch Tay: but a part of the vale of Glen Lochay which belongs to it, extends much farther, and some places of it are not less than 28 miles from the Parish Church : a small part also of Glen Quaich belongs to it, which lies to the Southward, and is separated from the body ofthe Parish by a lofty mountain, five miles over. The soil on the banks of Loch Tay is a rich loam, and the arable parts ofthe hills are ofa light mossy nature, not unfriendly to vegetation. The Village of Kenmore is neatly built, and delightfully situate on an isthmus projecting into the Eastern extremity of Loch Tay, from which point an elegant bridge, of 5 arches, is built over the Tay. Here is a Parochial School : and The Society for Propagating Christian Know ledge also maintain four Schools within the bounds of the Parish. On a small Island, at the East end of Loch Tay, are the ruins of a Priory, formerly dependent on the Religious establishment at Scone: it was founded in the year 1122, by Alexander the First of Scotland, and in it the remains of his Queen Sibilla, the natural daughter of Henry the First of England, were deposited. From the ancient inhabitants of this Holy Island, the present Noble Owner has liberty to fish in the Lake at all times of the year ; which is denied to the other Land owners in the neighbourhood : but it was necessary for the Monks to be indulged with that privilege, as their very existence depended upon it. To this Island the Campbells retreated at the approach of The Marquis of Montrose, where they defended themselves for some time : a shot having narrowly missed him, he was enraged to such a degree as to cause fire and sword to be instantly carried through the whole country : it was taken, and garrisoned ; but, in 1654, was surrendered to General Monk. Taymouth, the principal seat of The Earl of Breadalbane, R2"], [138, "KEN lies nearly two miles to the North-East of the Village ; it was originally called Balloch Castle, or Tlie Castle at the discharge of the Lake ; and was built by Sir Colin Campbell, sixth Knight of Loch Ow, who died in the year 1583. This place has been much modernized since the days of its founder ; and is now sur rounded with extensive pleasure grounds, in the finest taste, and cultivation. Burns, the poet, has given a beautiful description of the scene. See, Glen Lochar/. By a Memorial, which was presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges by the great Land Owners, in the month of July 1807, it appears, \" That much inconvenience is experienced by the inhabitants of the country which is situate along the sides of Loch Tay, from the want of a more direct communication with the Low-iands, than is afforded by the roads which proceed from the exremities of that district, at Kenmore, and Killin. These places are 16 miles (the length of Loch Tay) distant from each other ; and, although they are connected by good roads on each side ofthe Loch, yet the Inhabitants ofthe intermediate district in using these roads as a communication with Comrie, Crieff or Stirling, make a very circuitous journey, compared with that which they would have to perform were a good road made from about the middle ofthe District, on the South side of the Loch through Glen Lednaig to Comrie. The distance from Stirling to Kenmore, by Crieff and Tay Bridge, is 46 miles, to which if 8 miles be added as a medium distance from Kenmore to the Country situate between Kenmore and Killin, the total distance from Stirling to that District will be 54 miles ; in like manner the distance from Stirling by Callander and Loch-Earn-Head to Killin, being 38 miles, and 8 miles more being added as the distance from Killin to the District opposite the centre of Loch Tay, the total distance of that district from Stirling by Killin will be 46 miles. The distance from Perth to Kenmore is 37 miles, aud 8 miles more being added as above, the total distance from Perth to the district above mentioned is 45 miles. \u2014 Stirling and Perth are the nearest, and the only Sea- Ports with which Breadalbane is connected ; and it is from these places, that all the coals used in that district are brought. \u2014 There is another district of country, to the Southward of that which has been described, which sustains at present the similar inconvenience of a very circuitous communication with the Ports of the Forth and Coal country situate along that river, while a much more direct communication might be made, vis., The Village of Comrie- and that part of Strath Earn, which is situate in its neighbourhood. The distance from Stirling to Comrie by Crieff is 28 miles. \u2014 To remove the inconvenience thus experienced"], [139, "KEN by the country situate along Loch Tay, and by that around Comrie, it has been long and frequently proposed to open a Road from the South side of Loch Tay, near the Village of Ardeonich through Glen Lednaig to Comrie, and to continue this line of road from Comrie, through Glen Lichorn by Ardock and Kinbuck towards Dunblane and Stirling. The effects of this line of road being carried through, would be, to reduce the distance from Stirling to Comrie from 28 to 20 miles, and to reduce the distance from Stirling to the centre of Loch Tay, from 54 miles by Kenmore, or 46 miles by Killin to 34 miles, being a reduction of total distance of 20 miles in the former, and 12 miles in the latter case. \u2014 There exist at present, in the course above described, unformed tracks, and accessible only to horses or the lightest country carts with very small loads. \u2014 The expense of making these roads, if wholly defrayed by the voluntary contributions of the Landholders through whose estates they pass, would very greatly exceed the benefit and advantage which would result to them individually from the execu tion of such a work. At the same time the Memorialists are willing, to a certain extent, to devote to the improvement of that part ofthe country in which their estates are situate, a very considerable portion of their private fortunes, for the attainment of that object : and they are willing to subject themselves to the con dition of advancing one-half of the expense, in terms of the Act of the 43\u00b0 Geo. HI., provided The Commissioners, appointed by that Act, shall be of opinion, that the circumstances ofthe case which they have stated, fall under the intendment of that liberal and most beneficial enactment. \u2014 The Districts, above described, would derive from these roads their whole supply of coal, which it is of very great consequence to obtain at such a rate as to enable the inhabitants along the sides of Loch Tay to avail themselves of it, for burning the lime-stone with which the country abounds. These roads would form the great lines of communication with the Lowlands and with the Sea-Port of Alloa, and they would facilitate to a great degree the intercourse of Districts of country between which a very con siderable traffic would exist, arising from the exportation of timber, oak, bark, slates, lime-stone, wool, &c, and the importation of all sorts of manufactured goods and merchandize.\" \u2014 Upon a deliberate consideration of this Road, The Commissioners did not think fit to extend Public aid to that part of it South of Comrie, aud the event has justified their decision, as it has since been made under a Turnpike Act. But the Northern portion ofthe road between Loch Tay side and Comrie, has recently been completed ; and its future maintenance placed on a proper footing, by the Act for the repair of certain Roads in the Shire of Perth."], [140, "K E P The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday, O.

The Pow or Harbour, on the Forth, has 17 feet of water at Spring tides, and is capable of being greatly enlarged : it is the property of Alexander Bruce, Esq., of Kennet, who has built an elegant modern House there. Here was formerly a Salt pan ; at present a Colliery is worked to a considerable ex tent, and a great Distillery has lately been established. Mr. Bruce is a Claim ant, in opposition to The Earl of Elgin, for the Chiefship of the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Bruce : And he has also a Claim to the Attainted Title of Baron Burleigh. The Pow of Kennet Pans is within the District of the Port of Alloa. KENNOWAY, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 80 bolls of meal and bear, and 500 merks in money : the glebe consists of 6 acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church, and manse, are old. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1466, and, in 1811, was 1517. It is 20|* m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established at Windygales, within a mile of the Village. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth : the soil is all arable, and gener ally fertile, and the greatest part is inclosed. Coals are the common fuel, brought from the neighbouring Parishes. The air is dry, and salubrious. The turn-pike road is in good repair. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, including a donation of \u00a320. Scotch, is upwards of \u00a316..0..0.

This is a small Village, situate on the North- Eastern shore of Loch-na-Gaul: its Resident Population, in 1811, was 129. It is also a Farm at the junction ofthe Roy and Spean in Lochaber, formerly the Seat ofthe Chieftains ofthe name of Macdonald. Even so lately as in the last"], [141, "K E R years of King William, a battle was fought at Mull Roy, on a plain a few miles to the South of Inverness, between the Clans of Mackintosh, and Macdonald, of Keppoch. Colonel Macdonald, the Chief of a small Clan, refused to pay the dues demanded from him by Mackintosh, as his Superior lord. They dis dained the interposition of judges and laws, and calling each his followers to maintain the dignity ofthe Clan, fought a formal battle, in which several con siderable men fell on the side of Mackintosh, without a complete victory to either. This is said to have been the last open war made between the Clans, by their own authority. KERERA, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part of the Parish of Killmore. This Island is separated from the Mainland of the district of Lorn by a Sound of about a mile broad, over which there is a safe and convenient Ferry, about two miles from Oban. It is about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth ; the surface is mountainous, and many ofthe rocks have a volcanic appearance. Here are two good harbours, called the Ardintrive, and Horse-Shoe Bay; at the latter of which King Alexander the Second died, when upon an expedition against the Danes, on the 8th of July 1249. The whole Island is the property of Mr. Macdougal, of Dunolly Castle, (once the residence of the ancient Chieftains of Lorn, from whom he is descended) except a small farm, which belongs to The Earl of Breadalbane. Here is a Charity School. From hence is a Ferry, of about eight or ten miles broad, to the Inn of Achnacraig, in the Isle of Mull. KERLOACK, MOUNTAIN, v. STRACHAN. KERRILA, CASTLE, v. STEVENSTON.

On the top of Kers hope Hill, there stood a monumental stone, called Taits Cross; but the cause"], [142, "KET of its erection cannot now be traced to its origin. Mr. Chalmers informs us, from a manuscript description of the Shire of Selkirk by Mr. John Hodge, in 1722, \" that there was then to be seen, at Tait's Cross, bonghted and milked, upwards of 12,000 ewes, in the month of June, about eight o'Clock at night, at one view.\" Boughted is a verb, formed from the substantive bought or bright, which meant in the speech of the Shepherds, a fold for ewes, while they were milked. There is an old Song : \" Will ye go to the ewe-buchts, Marion? \" And wear in the sheep wi' me.\" KERSIE FERRY, v. AIRTH. KERSWELL, v. CARNWATH. KESSOCK, WESTER, v. KILLEARNAN.

KETTINS, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 12 chalders of victual, and \u00a35. for Communion elements : the manse was built in 1792: the glebe consists of nearly 4 acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church was built in 1768, and anciently had six Chapels depend ent upon it, viz., one at the Village of Peatie, another at South Coston, a third at Pitcur, a fourth at Muiry-Faulds, a fifth at Denhead, and a sixth on the South side of the village of Kettins. It is in the Presbytery of Meigle, arid Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1207, and, in 1811, was 1241. It is 1 m. S. E. from Cupar of Angus. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and nearly 4 miles in breadth. The soil is generally good, consisting in many parts of a rich black loam : and it is mostly inclosed, and well cultivated. Fuel is scarce. The Salary of the Parochial School is the maximum, together with School-fees, and an excellent School and School -house built in 1808, and about half an acre of land : besides which, there are mortifications for the education of children belonging to the Parish. Hali burton House, a modern Mansion, is the residence of the very respectable Family of Haliburton, who were very active in effecting the Reformation ofthe Church of Scotland, and are the chief Heritors ofthe Parish. Lintrose, formerly called Todderance, belonged to Mr. Haliburton, whose Grandfather, Lord Todder ance, was a Senator ofthe College of Justice, and a Nephew of the House of Pitcur: it is now the residence of John Murray, Esq., and is surrounded with"], [143, "KET fertile fields and thriving plantations. The Castle of Pitcur, now in ruins, gave the title of Baron (now extinct) to the Ancient and Noble family of Haliburton, the Chief of that name. The Castle of Dores was situate on the summit of the Hill of this name, about three miles to the South ; but scarcely any vestiges of it now remain ; and tradition reports it to have been for some time the residence of Macbeth. At Baldowrie is an ancient Danish Monument with some figures upon it, but they are now almost obliterated. A number of stone coffins have lately been dug up in different parts of the Parish ; together with several urns of very rude manufacture, in many of which were ashes and bones, and some pieces of metal. Bandirran, though locally situate in the Shire of Perth, never theless belongs to the Parish of Kettins ; from which it is detached about six miles to the South-West, and is the residence and estate of Miss Drummond, of Gardrum. General Roy has preserved a plan of one of the temporary works of Agricola at a place, called Camp Muir, near Lintrose, pi. 14. KETTLE, or KING'S KETTLE, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 24 bolls of barley, 41 bolls of meal, and \u00a350..0..0. in money, together with \u00a38.. 6. .8. for Communion elements, and \u00a32.. 3. .4. for Pasturage : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of the legal extent : Patron, The Crown : The Church was built in 1636. It is in the Presbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Balmalcolm, and Coalton) was 1889, and, in 1811, was 1968. It is 4 m. E.N.E. from Falk land. This Parish contains 5668 Scotch acres, stretching along the Vale which extends from Kinross to St. Andrew's. On the banks of the Eden, which is subject to inundations, the soil is of an excellent carse; and even in the hilly districts, it affords good pasture for all kinds of cattle. The climate is, for the most part, dry and healthy. There are inexhaustible Quarries of free-stone, moor-stone, lime-stone, and iron-stone, all of an excellent quality ; together with coals of a superior kind. The amount of the School-master's salary, including the dwelling and Session-clerkship, is about \u00a322. per annum, besides School-fees. A considerable quantity of linen is manufactured here. The roads are in good repair. Services of all kinds are entirely abolished. The Lands of Kettle were formerly the property of the Crown, and were afterwards feued in eight Divisions, in perpetual tacks, at the rents then received; which are still paid to the King, under the name of Crown Rents. Lathrisk, the elegant modern Mansion of William Johnstone, Esq., is surrounded with extensive Plantations. On vol. h. S"], [144, "K I L Bandon Hill, and Down Hill\\are the remains of circular encampments : there are also several barrows. Clatto, an ancient Castle of great strength, is said to have been the residence ofa Family of Seatons. KILDA, ST., or HIRTA, the most remote ofthe Western Isles, and in the Shire of Inverness. It is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0 50' North, and 20 leagues West from the Sound of Harris. This Isle is about 3 miles in length, and 2 in breadth, and about 9\\ miles in circumference. It is encircled with one continued perpen dicular face of rock, of prodigious height, except a part of the Bay or landing place, which lies towards the South-East, and even there the rocks are of great height ; and the narrow passage to the summit ofthe rock is so steep, that a few men with stones, could prevent any hostile attempts from landing on the Isle. The Bay is also difficult of access, as the tides and waves are so impetuous, that, unless in a calm, it is extremely dangerous of approach. The surface ofthe Isle is rocky, rising into four or five high mountains, of which Congara is the most lofty ; and is covered to the depth of 6 or 18 inches with a blackish loam, except on the tops of the hills, where there is 3 feet depth of moss. The soil, though naturally poor, is, however, rendered fertile by the singular industry of the In habitants, who manure their fields, so as to convert them into a sort of garden. They sow and reap much earlier than in other Islands in the same Latitude : the Harvest is commonly over before September ; but, if it unfortunately happens otherwise, the whole crop is liable to be destroyed by the Equinoctial storms, which in this Isle are attended with the most impetuous hurricanes, and exces sive rains. Barley, and oats, are only sown ; and, of the former, about 50 bolls are annually exported to Harris, the grain of which is of a very superior quality to that produced by the other Western Islands. Potatoes have lately been intro duced ; and cabbages, and other garden plants, are now begun to be used. There are several springs, that form a small burn or rivulet which runs close past the Village ; and which is situate about a quarter of a mile from the Bay, on the South-East, the houses being built in two pretty regular rows, facing one another, with a spacious street in the middle : This Village is called, Their Country: and the little Isles of Boreray, and Soay, which are about 6 miles dis tant and well stocked with sheep, are named, The North Country. The Gaelic is the only language spoken here. The Resident Population, in 1764, was only 88 : formerly it was more populous, but, in 1730, one ofthe Inhabitants going to Harris, was attacked with the Small-pox, and died : unluckily, his clothes were carried back to St. Kilda the following year by one of his relations, aud thus was"], [145, "K I L the infection communicated, which made such havoc, that only four adults were lest alive. Mr. Martin, and Mr. Macaulay, who visited this Isle, have given us the most interesting descriptions of it, and especially the method of catching wild fowls, which, during the season of incubation, absolutely cover the whole Isle, and every interstice in the impending rocks. These birds are of various kinds ; but the Fulmar, a grey bird about the size of a moor-hen and with a strong bill, is, according to The Rev. Mr. Buchanan, the most highly esteemed by the inhabitants, for its many good qualities; as they think the world cannot produce any thing to equal it in value : the Fulmar furnishes oil for the lamp, down for the bed, the most salubriousybod, and the most efficacious ointment for healing of wounds: in a word, say the poor inhabitants, \" Deprive us of the Fulmar, and St. Kilda is no more :\" this bird lays only one egg in a season ; the least offence makes her quit her nest, so nice are her feelings ; and it is, therefore, a high crime in St. Kilda to plunder its nest. The Laird of Macleod is the Proprietor ; and the Isle is visited annually by his Steward, to collect the rents, which are paid in sheep, butter, cheese, and wild fowl. They profess the Protestant Religion : and their Minister is engaged to explain the English Bible into Gaelic : the Salary annexed to this office is about \u00a325. per annum, being mostly a mortification of 300 merks left by a gentleman of the name of Macleod, to be given to any name-sake, who can answer the above purpose ; and the rest to be made up by The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge in Scotland. This Isle is rendered remarkable, for its having been the place of imprisonment, and of the mysterious death, of The Honourable Lady Grange, in 1733. KILDINGUIE, WELL of, v. STRONSAY, ISLAND.

From the Proprietors of a certain District in this Parish, the Minister of Eglesham receives annually, 16 bolls of Craig-Mul- loch corn ; so called from a hill in that District. The corn which this hill usually produces, is uncommonly bad ; hence Craig-Midloch corn is a Proverbial ex- pression, for corn of the worst quality. The inhabitants of this part of Kill- bride have a claim on the Minister of Eglesham, for a Sermon to be preached among them every ten weeks, and a Ministerial visit once a year. This claim, however, is either not made or not complied with : but care is taken, that there shall be no risk ofa proscription, with regard to the payment ofthe corn.

The first of this branch of the-LiNDSAY family was John, the second son of Sir David Lindsay, of Edzel, in Angus, by Jane his wife, daughter of Sir John Campbell, of Calder : He was made one of the Senators of the College of Justice by King James the Sixth, Secretary of State, and a Commissioner ofthe Treasury : He married Margaret Luvan, and deceasing in 1598, left David his heir, who was, on the 7th of June"], [157, "K I L 1663, created Lord Lindsay; and whose son Alexander was created Earl of of Balcarras, in 1651, by Charles the Second.

The Castle of Rires, the property of Mr. Bayne, merits also particular notice, although its ancient magnificence is much decayed. The Fairs are holden on the 14th of May, and the 8th of November. KILLCOY, v. KILLEARNAN. K1LLDALTON, in the Island of Islay, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was for one-third of the Teind and Tack duties of the Island \u00a346.. 10.. 4\\, including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion ele ments, and \u00a3111..16..3|. by Parliamentary augmentation: the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe is large : Patron, The Crown : The Church, which is situate near the Farm of Bailie Naughton, is in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery of Cantyre, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1990, and, in 1811, was 2269. It lies on the South- East side ofthe Island, and is about 15 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth. The soil is various, and poorly cultivated. The principal exports are black cattle, horses, and linen yarn. There are many good anchoring places along the shore, especially in the bay of Loch Knock, and at Lagamhuilin about 3 miles to the South-West of it, where there is a small village, and a quay. Peats are in plenty. Mr. Campbell, of Shawfield, is proprietor ofthe whole parish. Here is a Parochial School, and also a Charity School, both of which have good School houses, and dwellings. The roads are bad. Upon a Promontory, called Dun- Aidh, are the remains of a large Danish Fort. The Castle of Dun- Naomhaig, now in ruins, is said to have been the residence ofthe Macdonalds, of Islay. KILL-DONAN, in the Shire of Sutherland : formerly a Vicarage, the Sti pend of which, in 1795, being the full Teind of the Parish, was \u00a387.. 18.. 10. in money, including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, 2 firlots 1 peck 2-f- lippies of victual, and \u00a369.. 15.. 10. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse is in tolerable repair: Patron, The Countess of Sutherland : The Church was built in 1786, and is dedicated to St.Donan. It is in the Presbytery of Dornoch, and Synod of Sutherland and Caithness. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1440, and, in 1811, was 1574. It is 15 m. N. b. E from Golspie. This Parish is computed to be 20 miles in length, and from a quarter ofa mile"], [158, "K I L to 8 miles in breadth. It is situate along each side of the river Helmsdale, for about 13 miles ; where it then stretches out into the three districts of Strath Tilney, Frigh, and Strath Beg, whose respective small streams are contributary to the Helmsdale. There are ten Lochs, which contain plenty of trout, and some salmon: and six mountains, not very high, but covered with heath. In the vallies the soil is light, fertile, and productive of tolerable crops, but subject to frequent inundations from the sudden swellings of the river. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with perquisites, and School fees. The Society have also a School here, with a Salary of \u00a39. Sterling. The Gaelic is the only language spoken here. There are several tumuli ; and three subterranean passages, which, it is said, extend under the bed of the river Helmsdale, from cairns on each side of it. This has long been the residence of the martial tribe of the Gunns ; a family of Norwegian extraction, who contri buted materially to extirpate the Danes out of Sutherland. KILL-DRUMMIE, in the Shire of Nairn ; and in the Parish of Nairn. It is 2f m. S. W. from Nairn. Here is the Seat of Hugh Rose, Esq., of Brae, to whom those Lands were sold by Patrick Hepburn, Bishop of Moray, in 1545. KILLDRUMMY, in the District of Alford, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a380.. 8. .1.

It is in the Presbytery of Alford, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 430, and, in 1811, was 470. It is 6 m. W. b. N. from, Alford. This Parish is situate in a Valley, from two to three miles square, and intersected by the river Don. The soil is a deep rich loam, exceedingly fertile, and the modern improvements in agriculture are now introduced. There is a considerable extent of natural wood on the banks of the Don ; and around the Mansions of Brux, the Seat of Jonathan Forbes, Esq., and of Clova, the Seat of Harry Lumsden, Esq., of Auchindore, are some small Plantations. The, Castle of Killdrummy, anciently a seat of King Robert Bruce, is a ruin of great antiquity : soon after the forfeiture of The Earl of Marr, in 1715, it came into the possession of a Proprietor, who suffered the whole to go to decay : But the Family of Fife having acquired the Superiorities ofthe Earldom of Marr, by purchase from the Crown, it is said, that they still retain the privilege of holding meetings, and transacting business, with the vassals in the Snow-Tower : it is"], [159, "K I L however, certain, that this never was, and it is much more than probable, that it never will be, ascertained by actual practice. KILL-DUICH, v. KINTAIL. KILLDUSCLAN, v. KNAPDALE, SOUTH. K1LLEAN, in the District of Cantyre, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Killchenzie united : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 6 chalders ofbear, Cantyre measure, and \u00a318..10..0. Sterling, together with a glebe, and \u00a312..10..0. in lieu ofa manse : Patron, The Duke of Argyle : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Cantyre, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2520, and, in 1811, was 2934. It is 18 m. N. N. W. from Campbell-Town. This Parish is 18 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, being bounded on the West by the Atlantic Ocean. The soil along the coast is in general sharp and sandy, but is very productive, from the abundant application of sea-ware, which is driven in by the storms, and collected by the Farmers for manure: the moun tains are chiefly covered with heath. The climate is very rainy, but not un healthy. Here are several Danish Forts, some rude Obelisks, and the remains ofa vitrified tower. There are four Schools in the Parish ; one of them being supported by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge, another by the Royal Bounty, and the other two by the Heritors. The roads are good. Fuel is scarce. Here is a Ferry to the Island of Giga. The Duke of Argyle is the principal Proprietor. KILLEAN, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Clyne. This is a beautiful Village, situate near the Eastern extremity of Loch Brora. KILLEARN, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : Patron, The Duke of Montrose : The Church was re-built in 1734, and is conveniently seated. It is in the Presbytery of Dum barton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1039, and, in 1811, was 997. It is 4 m. E. S. E. from Drymen. This Parish is 12 computed miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth, on the average. The soil is various, but in many parts fertile : and few places in Scot land afford a greater diversity of the grand and picturesque scenes of nature, grouped together in such pleasing varieties. It is watered by the Blane, and Enricki on the latter of which the village is situate. This Parish contains many ancient Family Seats, which, with their extensive policies and plantations, give vol. il U"], [160, "K I L it a rich and ornamented appearance : among these are, Tlie Place of Kill-earn, the property of The Right Honourable James Montgomery, Lord Chief Baron for Scotland : \u2014 Croy, of William Richardson, Esq., Professor of Humanity in The University of Glasgow : \u2014 BalUkinrain, of Robert Dunmore, Esq. ;\u2014Bal quhan, of Thomas Buchanan, Esq. : \u2014 and Carbeth, of John Buchanan, Esq. The Woods produce great varieties of indigenous Plants. On the Estate of Balglass, the property of Mr. Dunmore, is a large castellated Mansion, in which it is said Sir William Wallace, of Elderslie, the brave defender of his Country, found a safe retreat, when the power of Edward the First over-run Scotland : Near this are The Corries or Curries of Balglass ; these are semicircular excavations, naturally hollowed out in the Western extremity of that ridge of hills, commonly known by the name of Campsie and Strath Blane Fells : some of these Corries are very spacious, being more than a mile in diameter ; and, in several places, they beautifully exhibit the various mineral strata, of which the mountains are composed. At a Place, called The 3foss, George Buchanan, the celebrated Poet, and Historian, was born in 1506 : this is a small Farm-house on the bank ofthe water of Blane, and about two miles South-West from the Village of Killearn, and is so called, because it is situate in the vicinity of a Peat Moss, which is part ofthe Farm : This Farm was the property of George Buchanan's father, and was for a long time possessed by the name of Buchanan. It is now the property of Mr. William Finlay, of Moss, and holds ofthe family of Drum mikill, from whom the Ancestors of George were descended : Part of this hum ble dwelling has been re-built ; but Mr. Finlay is highly to be commended for preserving, as much as possible, the ancient construction and appearance of this far-famed and much honoured House : adjacent to the house are some old trees, which are reported to have been planted by George, when a boy In 1788, the gentlemen of this Parish and neighbourhood, impressed with a laudable ambition to contribute a testimony of respect to their learned Countryman, erected, by voluntary subscription, a beautiful Monument to his Memory ; which is a pleasing and patriotic evidence of what the Good and Great may always expect. The Pot of Gartness, in the water of Enrick, is a bea< tiful and romantic spot, well known for its entertainment to the Angler ; and adjacent to the Mill, are the remains of an old House, in which John Lord Napier, of Merchiston, the celebrated inventor of the Logarithms, resided for some years, whilst he made his calculations. The climate is wet and cold, but not unhealthy. The Public Roads are in good condition. The nearest coal is at the distance of 10 or 12"], [161, "K I L miles ; but this scarcity is supplied by turf and peat, for obtaining which the feuars and tenants have a servitude on the Moors. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees. Three or four Private Schools have also been kept, for some time past, in different parts of the Parish. A few superstitious Customs still prevail. The kippering of Salmon is successfully practised here. At Blaressen Spout-head, a severe battle, according to tradi tion, was fought between the Romans and the Scots; and several stones, set on edge, have continued ever since to distinguish the spot. This Parish and neigh bourhood were, for a long time, unhappily exposed to the plundering inroads of large companies of migratory Free-booters, who, for safety, lurked on the borders of the Highlands : this infamous practice prevailed so late as the year 1743, and perhaps later : Long before that time, however, some Gentlemen near the Border ofthe Highlands undertook, for certain sums of money, to pro tect the property of their neighbours, or to make a full recompense for what was stolen from them : the money paid for this protection was called The Black Mail, and was paid agreeably to a bargain concluded upon by the two con tracting parties: One ofthe original qontracts, dated in 1741, and which is a literary curiosity, still remains in the possession of Mr. Dunmore, at Balli kinrain. KILLEARNAN or KILL-IRENAN, in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 9 chalders and 1 boll ofbear, 3 chalders and 3 bolls of oat-meal, and \u00a398.. 9. .8. Scotch in money, together with a manse, anda glebe of 6 acres : Patron, The Hon. Mrs. Mackenzie : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Chanonry, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1131, and, in 1811, was 1390. It is 67 in. W. N. W. from Inverness. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern shore of Loch Beauly. The soil is various, and in general favourable to cultivation ; but agricultural improvements are in their infancy here. Fuel is expensive. Chapel- Town, and Spital, the names of two villages in the Parish, seemingly corroborate the confused traditions of the existence of two Religious Houses at some remote period. Here is a Parochial School ; and also one ofthe Society's Schools, which is well attended. There are several cairns, and tumuli, some of which are of uncommon magnitude. This Parish is wholly the property of the two residing Heritors, Mr. Grant, of Red-Castle, and Mr. Mackenzie, of Killcoy: but these Manor Houses have evidently been built more for defence than for elegance, or comfortable accommodation. Red-Castle, which was annexed U2"], [162, "K I L to the Crown, with the Lordship of Ross, in the year 1455, has the rights of a Burgh of Barony, and of a free Port, and of holding weekly Markets, levying tolls, and anchorage dues, together with all other Baronial privileges, not expressly abrogated by the Jurisdiction Act in 1748 : It is now surrounded with extensive and flourishing plantations. The lands of Wester Kessock are annexed, quoad sacra, to Killearnan. KILLERNY, CASTLE, v. SALINE. KILL-FIN AN, in the District of Cowal, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of oat-meal, Dutch weight, 8 stone to the boll, one chalder of barley, Linlithgow measure, and \u00a327.. 15.. 8^. Sterling in money: the manse was built in 1746: the glebe con sists of 3a. 2r. 12p. , together with a servitude of grass for two cows, and a horse, upon the Farm of Kill-Finan : Patron, Mr. Lamont, of Lamont: The Church is small, and in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1432, and, in 1811, was 1382. It is 30 m. S. S. E. from Inverary. This Parish is about 15 miles in length, and from 3 to 6 miles in breadth, being bounded on the West and North-West by Loch Fyne, and on the South by an arm of the sea, about 17 miles over, which separates it from the Isle of Arran. It is divided into two unequal parts, by a small water that runs past the Church into Loch-Fyne : \u2014 the Southern Division, called Kerriff or Kerry, is by far the most extensive, the Church standing upon it ; the whole Parish often goes by the name of the Par ish of The Kerry, and is fully as well known in the neighbourhood by that name, as by its real one, but it is never written so : \u2014 The Northern Division is called Otter, from a sand bank about 1800 yards long, which juts out into Loch Fyne, in a serpentine form, near the Seat of Mr. Campbell, of Otter, proprietor of the whole Division, except one Farm. The surface is rugged ; and the soil is thin, and poorly cultivated. The climate is changeable, and the rains often fall in torrents in the months of August and September, and do great injury to the crops. Fuel is expensive. The fisheries are prosecuted with success. The roads are bad. There are no real harbours upon this coast ; though there is safe anchorage for vessels of almost any burden in The Kyles of Bute, a narrow Sound which divides this Parish from that Island. There are three Ferries ; one of them at Otter, across Loch Fyne, to the Parish of Kill-Michael, in the dis trict of Argyle, which is very much frequented: \u2014 another on the line of road from Rothesay to Tarbert ; \u2014 and the third, from Bute to this Parish, across The Kyles. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, which is taught at the Church, is"], [163, "K I L \u00a34.. 6.. 3., together with \u00a34.. 15.. 6f., being the Interest ofa mortification for the benefit of the School, partly by a Mr. Lamont, in 1737, and partly b\\ a Lady whose name is unknown. Game is in plenty. Upon a rocky point, on the coast of Loch Fyne, about a mile below the Church, are the vestiges of a building called Caisteal Mhic Eobhuin, i. e. Macewen's Castle: this Macewen was the Chief ofa Clan, and proprietor of the district of Otter; and many of the Clan still reside upon the estate. The principal Heritor is Mr. Lamont, of Lamont, whose ancestors have long possessed property in the Shire of Argyle ; and who formerly resided in the Parish of Dunoon, until the reign of Charles the First, when the then proprietor, Sir James Lamont, of Lamont, supporting the cause of that unhappy Monarch, his family seat, the Castle of Towart, was taken and destroyed by The Marquis of Argyle. There are also the ruins of an old Castle, called Asgog : which was, at the above period, in the possession of a Cadet of that family, who, taking the same side with his Chief, had his Castle also demolished, by order of The Marquis. The taking and de stroying of these Castles, composed part of the indictment, upon which The Marquis was tried and convicted, as appears by the State Trials. The present family seat of Lamont, of Lamont, is at Aird-Lamont, a beautiful, rich, low lying farm, consisting of some hundreds of acres, in the Southern extremity of the Parish; which commands an extensive view of the Firth of Clyde, the coast of Airshire, the island of Arran, and the coasts of Kintyre and Knapdale. KILLFINICHEN, in The Isle of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Killviceuen united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : no manse : the glebe consists of 70 acres, including moss ; Patron, The Duke of Argle : There are four places of Worship in the Parish, one in each district, but there has been no Church in any of them since the Reformation, except in Ross, which is ruinous, and Divine service is performed at the others, at the side of a hill. It is in the Presbytery of Mull, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1791, (comprehending the Dis tricts of Killsinichan in Airdmeanach, Killviceuen in Ross, Brolass, and the Island of I-Colm-Kill) was 3002, and, in 1811, was 3205. It is 15 m. S. S.W. from Aros. The several Parishes into which the Isle of Mull was divided in the time of Popery, were all united at the Reformation, and called Hie Parish of Mull: it was then a part of the Presbytery of Lorn. About the time of the Re volution, all that part of Mull, North ofthe Isthmus of Aros, was erected into a Parish, called the Parish of Kill-Ninian. The rest of the Isle of Mull continued to be one Parish for upwards of 40 years aster this period, and was called The"], [164, "K I L Parish of Ross. But being too extensive a charge, a new Parish was erected, called the Parish of Torosay. What remained was in writings, called the Parish of Kill- finichen and Killviceuen, from two places of Worship, the one in Airdmeanach, called Killfinichen, and the other in Ross, called Killviceuen ; But in the coun- try, it is only known by the name of The Parish of Ross, from a large district of it so called. This very extensive Parish is situate in the South-West part ofthe Island ; its greatest length being 22 miles in a straight line, exclusive of the Island of I-Colm-Kill ; and its greatest breadth, about 12 measured miles. The Districts of I-Colm-Kill, Ross, and Brolass, lie to the South of Loch Scredan, an arm ofthe sea that runs 12 miles from West to East into the Parish, the whole of which may be called a Road, but the best anchoring ground is at Kill- finichen, and another place at the head ofthe Loch, called The Narrows, where vessels may ride in safety from all storms. The District of Airdmeanach lies to the North of Loch Scredan, and parallel to Ross, and Brolass ; and is about 12 measured miles in length, and from 3 to 6 measured miles in breadth. The Districts of Ross, and Brolass, are nearly of equal extent, and are separated from each other by a ridge of hills, of no great height ; they stretch in a line from the Sound of I, to the Parish of Torosay, about 22 measured miles, and are from 3 to 6 measured miles in breadth. The general appearance is mountainous and barren, and is principally appropriated to pasturage. The climate is temperate, but very rainy. The coast is bold, and rocky, indented with several creeks, but few of them afford safe anchorage, except the creeks of Barachan, and Poll- tairve or the Bull Pond, and Loch Lahich. Fish of various kinds are in great abundance. A considerable quantity of kelp is annually made here. In many parts ofthe Parish there are basaltic pillars, like those of Staffa, but not so large, so regular, nor so elegant. Marble, granite, free-stone, and lime-stone, of excel- lent quality, are in great plenty ; and there are appearances of coal in several parts, but they are not worked. The Duke of Argyle is the principal Heritor, and is highly aud justly beloved by his numerous tenantry, for his unbounded humanity and benevolence. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, which is sta tioned in Ross near the Church, is 300 merks, together with a rood of land. Though the inhabitants are by no means superstitious, they still retain an opi nion, handed down by their ancestors, that the Spirit ofthe last person who was buried, watches round the Church-yard until another is interred, to which the charge is delivered. There are several remarkable Caves, one of which was explored by Dr. Johnson, but he has not mentioned its name. See, Mull, Isle. KILLGOUR, v. FALKLAND."], [165, "K I L K1LLHEAD, v. CUMMERTREES.

The Holy or Consecrated Hill, it is probable that this was the most ancient place of Christian Worship in the Parish, and was the residence of The Culdees. KILLICRANKIE, v. MOULIN. KILLIGRAY, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inver ness : it constitutes part of the Parish of Harris. This Island is about 2 miles long, and one mile broad: the South end is a deep moss, and for the most part uncultivated : the North end is a sandy soil, but under excellent culture.

The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, paid by the Heritors, together with School-fees, and per quisites. Besides which, there are three other Schoolmasters in the Parish, who teach only English and Gaelic, with writing and arithmetic ; and three School mistresses, for sewing, and knitting of stockings : One of these School-masters has a Salary of \u00a314. Sterling from the Society for Propagating Christian Know ledge ; and each of the other two, have \u00a38.

The Parish of Killin is situate in the District of Breadalbane, being about 28 miles in length, and, in most places, from 6 to 8 miles in breadth ; comprehending Glen Dochart, aud Strath-Fillan, and part of Glen Falloch, and Glen Lochay. The surface is mountainous ; and the soil ofthe greater part ofthe Parish, is light and dry, but abundantly fertile when the season is favourable. The lakes, and rivers, are well stocked with"], [166, "K I L salmon, and trout. Game, of various kinds, are in plenty. The climate is moist, and cold, but not unhealthy. The Earl of Breadalbane is the principal Pro prietor ; and all the lands are holden of the Crown. Fuel is scarce. The great Military Road, from Stirling to Fort William, passes through a part of the Parish ; and it is otherwise well supplied with good roads, and bridges. Lime stone is abundant. The Gaelic language is generally spoken here. On the small plain of Dalrie, a battle was fought in 1306, between Robert Bruce, and the forces of the Shire of Argyle, under Macdougal, Chieftain of Lorn, in which the former was defeated.

The Castle of Duchal, the ancient seat ofthe family of Porterfield, is now in ruins. The four silver Communion cups (originally used for the purpose of Candlesticks) were kept with great care by the family of Glencairn, at Finlayston, and are holden in great veneration by the people ; having been used by the celebrated John Knox, when he first dispensed the Sacrament in Scotland. .KILL-MA-LEMNOC, v.

For that part, which is in the Shire of Argyle, - 1279. 2600. 4520. 4645. It is 3 m. N.W. from Fort William. This extensive Parish is of an irregular form, and is intersected by three arms ofthe sea : it is about 60 miles in length, and 30 miles in breadth : the greater part of it consisting of high mountains and hills, covered with heath, and affording excellent pasture for numerous flocks of sheep : the principal Mountain, Ben Nevis, being elevated 4370 feet above the level ofthe sea. In the vallies, upon the banks of the rivers Lochy and Nevis, and in several other places, there is a good deal of arable ground, of different qualities : but, in general, the soil is sandy, and shallow. On the coast, which extends nearly 70 miles, the soil is fertile, and early. The Climate is moist, but not unwholesome. The Herring fishery is prosecuted here with great suc cess. Loch Archaig, which is 16 miles long, and one broad, is the only fresh water Lake of any consequence in the Parish : from it issues the River Archaig, which, after running about a mile, discharges itself into Loch Lochy: the rivers, and lakes, abound with salmon. Game, and aquatic birds of all kinds, are plen tiful. There is no coal in the Parish : there are several veins of lead ore, and one in particular on the West side of Ben Nevis: lime-stone is abundant: and there are also quarries of beautifully variegated marble. On the borders of Loch EU, at the village of Ballachulish, partly in this Parish, and partly in the District of Appin, is an excellent Slate quarry. There are several extensive Caves ; one of which, in 1746, afforded a safe retreat to some Highlanders, who had been engaged in the Rebellion. Just opposite to this Cave, is a beautiful Cascade, on a small rivulet, which, falling down the side of Ben Nevis, forms an uninterrupted torrent for half a mile, before it joins its waters to the river Nevis in the vale below. There are at present about 14,000 acres of Wood. The Gaelic is the principal language spoken here. The Proprietors in the Parish, and the Superiors of whom they hold their lands, are, Proprietors.

There are 93 farms in the Parish, the average extent of each being 6\u00a3 square miles, and the annual rent about \u00a350. Sterling: of these farms, 54 belong to Loch EU, and 18 to Ardgour. On the banks of the river Lochy, are she re mains of an ancient Castle, which, tradition says, was built at the same time with the Castle of Inverness: this would seem to have belonged to Bancho, Hiane of Lochaber, and ancestor ofthe Royal House of Stewart, who had his Castle in this neighbourhood ; and, a little below the site of Tor Castle, there is a beauti ful walk, about a quarter ofa mile long, that still retains his name. On the side ofthe glen, opposite to the South-West part of Ben Nevis, lie scattered in ruins, the last vestiges of Dundhairdghall, an ancient vitrified Fort : its figure is nearly oval, and occupies the summit of a green hill, about 1200 feet in height. The Parish, in general, is well provided with excellent Peats, which are the chief fuel that is used. The prevailing name is Cameron ; many of whom have greatly distinguished themselves for their eminent learning, probity, and enter prise. Near the Eastern extremity of Loch Arkegg, was Auchnacarie, once the seat of Cameron, of Loch EU, Chief of the Clan Cameron, but burnt in 1746. He was, according to Mr. Pennant, esteemed by all parties the honestest and most sensible man of any that embarked in the pernicious and absurd attempt of that and the preceding year, and was a melancholy instance ofa fine understand ing and a well-intending heart, over-powered by the unhappy prejudices of edu cation. By his influence he prevented the Rebels from committing several excesses, and even saved the City of Glasgow from being plundered, when their army returned out of England, irritated with their disappointment, and enraged at the loyalty which that City had shewn. The Pretender came to him as soon as he landed. Loch EU seeing him arrive in so wild a manner, and so unsupported, entreated him to desist from an enterprise from which nothing but certain ruin could result to him and his partizans. The Adventurer grew warm, and re proached Loch Eil with a breach of promise. This affected him so deeply, that he instantly went and took a tender and moving leave of his lady and family, imagining he was on the point of parting with them for ever. He was wounded at the battle of Culhden, and died in France, Colonel of a regiment, in 1748.

These extensive estates are now the property of his worthy descendant Colonel Donald Cameron, of Loch EU. Mr. John Innes, author ofthe \" Treatise on the Muscles,\" and \" Anatomical Tables ofthe Human Body,\" was a native of this Parish. There are eight stated Fer ries ; five of which are on the salt water. The Government Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair ; and here the Eastern extremity of the great Loch-na- Gaul road terminates. Besides the Parochial School, which is situate at Fort Wil liam, there are five other Schools, on the establishment ofthe Society for propa gating Christian Knowledge; to one of these, they grant a Salary of \u00a322., and to the rest \u00a312. each. There is also a Catechist, employed between this Parish and that of Kill-Manivaig, with a Salary of \u00a312. Sterling.

It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Tarf, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 2541, and, in 1811, was 2407. It is 10 m. N. N. E. from Fort William. This Parish is about 60 miles in length, and about 20 miles at its greatest breadth : its surface is much diversified by ranges of lofty mountains, intersected by extensive glens in different directions, and rapid rivers, most of which empty themselves into the river Lochy, the common reservoir, that runs into Loch EU, a branch ofthe Atlantic Ocean, at Fort Wil liam. The Climate is extremely rainy, though not unhealthy ; but the wetness is an invincible bar to the raising of corn, sufficient for the subsistence of the Inhabitants. Owing to the irregular surface, and vast extent of this Parish, the soil is extremely various, but chiefly partakes ofa light sandy nature, and some times of a black loam. The number of Sheep is computed to be 60,000, and that of black cattle 1500. Civilization, and Industry, are making daily progress here. The Gaelic is the general language. There are two Missionaries who are partly connected with this Parish, and two Roman Catholic clergymen. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and per quisites. There are also two Society Schools : but two other Schools at least, of the same description, are necessary. In this District is the ruin ofthe ancient Castle of Inver Lochy, the only remnant of the once thriving Burgh of that name and which some of the old Scotch Historians call, The Emporium of the West"], [171, "K I L of Scotland. By whom this Castle was built, is unknown : but, from the name ofthe Western Tower, it is probable that it was occupied by the Cummings, in the time of Edward the First of England, when they were most powerful : and, previous to that time, by the Hianes of Lochaber, among others by the noted Bancho, predecessor ofthe Royal House of Stewart. There is a tradition, that this Castle was once a Royal Residence, and that the famous league between Charles Hie Great of France, and Achaius King of the Scots, was signed here, about the end ofthe Eighth Century. But the most remarkable antiquity, which this Parish can boast, is the famous Parallel Roads, which, if really artificial, are, one of the most stupendous monuments of human industry. They are to be seen in the Eastern part of this Parish, on the declivities of steep and lofty mountains, which extend for seven or eight miles on each side of the water of Roy, in the direction of South-West and North-East, and the opening between which forms the Valley, that goes by the name of Glen-Roy. There were originally three lines of these Roads on each side ofthe glen, each corresponding in height to the one opposite to it ; the lowermost, however, is in some parts, effaced, particularly on the South side. They all run parallel to each other, and in an horizontal direction, accommodating themselves to the windings of the Mountains. Their dimensions are various ; in general, they are from 60 to 70 feet in breadth ; and the distance between two of them has been found to be 180 feet. Similar Roads are likewise to be seen in two ofthe adjacent glens, but not in such perfection. There is nothing left upon record respecting the time when, the persons by whom, or the purposes for which, these roads were constructed. It is said, that they were made by the Kings of Scotland, when the Royal Resi dence was in the Castle of Inver- Lochy, which is not above 11 miles distant from the nearest of them : According to another tradition, which is that of the Natives, they were made by the Heroes of Fingal ; and, under the name of Casan, or The Roads, they are still known in this country. But it is much more likely, that these roads, which are all absolutely level, are the stones of an ancient Lake, which, by some extraordinary convulsion, has been converted into dry land. At High-Bridge, is a fine bridge of three arches over the rapid torrent Spean, which was built by General Wade ; it is situate upon the great Military road, between Fort William and Fort George.

This Parish is situate in a beautiful Valley, watered by the river Motray, and contains 3963 Scotch acres ; of which, 3216 are arable, and in a high state of cultivation. Several plantations have lately been made here, and are in a flourishing condition. Fuel is expensive. The principal Family Seats are Rathillet, Loch Malony, and Mount Whanna. KILLMARNOCK, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : a Collegiate Church, with a handsome Chapel erected in 1731: the Stipend of the First Minister, in 1811, being 8 chalders, wanting one boll, which are wholly paid in meal, together with a glebe of 12 acres : the Stipend ofthe Second Minister was \u00a39..13..7f in money, a yearly annuity payable by the Town, being the proceeds ofa Subscription, \u00a326.. 13.. 4., 79 bolls 1 firlot 3TV lippies of meal, \u00a34.. 3.. 4. for Communion elements, and \u00a333..8..10. by Parliamentary augmen tation, and a glebe of 4\\ acres : Patron, of both Benefices, The Duchess of Port land : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 8079, and, in 1811, was 10,148. It is 65 m. S W. b. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on Fasten's Eve in February, the First Tuesday, O. S., in May, the third Wednesday, O. S., in July, and the third Wednesday, O. S., in October. It is an irregularly built Town, situate in a Valley, on each side of a rivulet, which is a tributary stream to the Irvine. It is a Burgh of Barony, governed by 2 Baillies, a Council of 12 of the Merchants, and the Deacons of the 5 Incorporated Trades. The first Charter in its favour,was granted to Thomas, Lord Boyd, in 1591 ; which was renewed and amplified in favour of William, Earl of Killmarnock, in 1672, and ratified by Act of Parliament the same year. In 1700, the Magistrates and Town Council obtained a grant from the Killmarnock family, of the whole common good, and customs of the Burgh ; and it is in virtue of this grant, that the Cor poration holds its present property, and is considered as an heritor in the Parish. Upon the attainder of The Earl of Killmarnock in 1745, the Superiority of the Burgh became vested in the Crown. A considerable trade is carried on here in the manufacture of carpets, serges, and other woollen cloths, and in sadlery,"], [173, "K I L shoes, and leather. The Salary of the Grammar School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a voluntary offering at Christmas : The Salary of the English School is \u00a310., together with School-fees : both of these Schools are ably conducted, and are in a flourishing condition. A General Post-Office is estab- lished here. The Parish of Killmarnock contains about 5900 Scotch acres. The soil is deep, strong, and fertile, inclining a little to moss, on the Northern border; and the greater part is inclosed, and highly cultivated. The climate is moist and damp, but not unhealthy. Coals, of an excellent quality, are in the greatest abundance. The Public roads are in good repair. The greater part of the Parish is the property of Miss Scott, now The Duchess of Portland. Colonel Crawfurd is the only considerable resident Proprietor, at his beautiful Seat of Craufurdland : and, it is a singular circumstance, in regard to the Crawfurd- land family, that its present respectable Representative, is the Twenty-first lineally descended from the original stock, without the intervention of even a second brother. The Countess of Loudon (now married to Francis Earl of Moira), another Proprietor, represents the Ancient and Illustrious family ofthe Muirs, of Rowallen, from whom the greater part of the Sovereigns of Europe are descended ; Robert the Third, King of Scotland, being the son of Robert the Second by Elizabeth Muir, daughter of Sir Adam Muir, of Roicallen. About half a mile North-East from the town, is Dean Castle, a very ancient edifice, and formerly the residence of the noble and unfortunate family of Killmarnock : in 1735, it was accidentally destroyed by fire, and still remains in the same desolate condition ; Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. In an area ofthe Town, stands a stone Pillar of elegant workmanship, erected in memory of Lord Soules, an English Nobleman, who was killed on the spot, in 1444, by an arrow from one of the family of Boyd.

It is beautifully situate on the Southern bank of the river Enrick, at the distance of a mile W. b. S. from Drymen. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth. On the banks of the"], [174, "K I L river, the soil is a deep rich loam, very favourable for pasturage or tillage ; on the rising grounds above the plain, it is in general a cold wet till ; and, towards the moors, it degenerates into a moss. There are three corn-mills, to which the greatest part of the lands are thirled. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees. Peats are the common fuel ; but coals are used by some families, which are brought from Kill-Patrick, at the distance of 12 or 14 miles. The Roads are in excellent repair. There are several woods, the value of which has considerably increased of late years ; and in those on the banks of Loch Lomond, belonging to Miss Buchanan, of Drumkill, and John Buchanan, Esq., of Ardoch, woodcocks abound in the beginning of winter. At Catter, now the property of The Duke of Montrose, is a large artificial Mound of earth, where, in ancient times, the Baronial Courts were holden ; near to which The Dukes of Lennox had a residence, but there is not now the smallest vestige ofthe building. The Castle of Kill- Mar onock, the property of Robert Macgoune, Esq., of Mains ; and the Castle of Batturret, the property of George Haldane, Esq., of Gleneagles, both in ruins, appear to have been formerly very magnificent edifices. So late as the year 1745, the tax, called Black mail, was paid for protection against the depredations of certain freebooters, who infested the neighbourhood. Near the confluence ofthe river Leven with Loch Lomond, is the Village of Balloch, where a large Fair for horses is holden annually on the 15th of September. There is a Ferry over the Leven to Bonhil. KILL-MARTIN, in the District, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse was built in 1789, and is a tolerably commodious house : the glebe is supposed to be legal as to extent, with 4 soums grass, in common with the cattle ofthe Farm : Patron, The Duke of Argyle: The Church was built in 1601. It is in the Presbytery oflnverary, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1501, and, in 1811, was 1453. It is 7| m. N. N. W. from Loch-Gilp-Head. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. In the South- West district, the soil is rather light, and fertile : towards the North-East, the soil is deeper, but from its cold and elevated situation, the crops are very uncer tain. The valley, from the Church to Loch Awe. is one ofthe most beautiful in the Highlands ; and through it, is the great line of road from Cantyre to Fort William, on which this Village is a stage, with a commodious Inn. Three large Markets are annually holden here, viz., one for black cattle, and two for horses The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. The Salary of the Parochial School"], [175, "K I L js 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites : and the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge, have also a School here, with a Salary of \u00a39. Loch Awe, the only considerable Lake in the Parish, is computed to be 24 miles in length, and abounds with salmon, and trout of a great size. Fuel is scarce. Game, of various kinds, are in plenty. The extent of coast is about 8 miles, and is formed by an arm ofthe sea, called Loch Craignish : the shore is, for the most part, high and rocky, except the Bay of Crinan, and the end of Loch Craig nish, which are fine flat sands. In the excellent Harbour of Loch Crinan, which is not only the principal one in this Parish, but is considered as the best upon a great tract of the Western coast, almost the whole of the Buss Herring fleet anchor, in their voyages to and from the fishing ground : and on a survey made by Mr. Rennie, an eminent engineer, it having been found practicable to make a navigable canal for large vessels, from Loch Crinan to Loch Gilp, a distance only of 5 miles ; a subscription was accordingly set on foot, and the plan being happily completed, a communication is opened between Loch Fine and the Atlantic, which thereby avoids the long and very dangerous voyage round The Mull of Cantyre, and promises the greatest advantages to this part. of the kingdom. Poltalloch, pleasantly situate on the Eastern shore of the Bay of Craignish, is the residence of Neill Malcolm, Esq., whose active and patriotic exertions are truly exemplary. It is now under the consideration of The Par liamentary Commissioners to make a road Westward from Inverary, across the middle of Loch Avie, at the Ferry of Portansherry, to Loch Feochan, on the Atlantic Ocean, a distance of twenty miles ; and which will doubtless be of great benefit to the adjacent district.

Montgomery : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Popu lation of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1288, and, in 1811, was 1432. It is 2 m. N. from Killmarnock. It is pleasantly situate on a gentle ascent, and was erected into a Burgh of Barony by James the Fifth, at the instance of Cuthbert, Earl of Glencairn, who formerly had extensive possessions here. It is governed by two Baillies, whc are annually elected by the majority of Por tioned. It formerly had a considerable trade in cutlery, and \" as sharp as a Kill maurs whittle,\" is still proverbial. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth.

On the banks of the Carmel, is The Mote or Carmel Bank, the charming Seat of Mr. John Cuninghame, whose benevolence and patriotic exertions are most exemplary. Bushy Castle, now in ruins, was long the property of a family of Barclays ; but now, with the adjacent lands, belongs by purchase to The Duchess of Portland. The Kirk of Killmaurs was made Collegiate by Sir William Cuninghame, on the 13th of May 1403, and endowed by him with certain lands, for the support of a Provost, eight Prebendaries, and two Singing Boys : it is difficult to deter mine where these lands were situate, though it is probable, that part of them are now the property of Mr. Watson ; as the ancient Tower, probably the resi dence ofthe Religious, is only separated from the Church by a garden, and the contiguous lands, consisting of nearly 80 acres, pay no Teind either to the Titular or Minister. Killmaurs gives the title of Baron to the dormant Earldom of Glencairn. KILLMAUX, v. SCOONIE. KILLMAVEONOG, i. e.

It is 12 m. S. from Oban. It is situate at the head of Loch Melfort, a beautiful and safe roadsted, and which abounds with a variety of fish. An excellent line of road has been made through the glebe to the Inn of Kinlraw, a distance of 8j miles, under the auspices of The Parlia mentary Commissioners: and which completes the great and useful line of road from Loch-Gilp-Head, by the West end of the Crinan Canal, to Oban ; and from thence branching off to the Northward by the Ferries of Connel, Shean, and Ballahulish, to Fort William. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1811, was 372. See, Killninver.

KILL-MODAN, anciently GLENDUISK, and GLENDARUAIL, in the District ofCowal, and Shire of Argyle: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse was built in 1773 : the glebe consists of 10 acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church was built in 1783. It is in the Presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 502, and, in 1811, was 622. It is 16 m. N. N. W. from Rothesay. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and the inhabited part is nearly half a mile in breadth, being a long narrow Glen, watered by the river Ruail. The soil is deep and fertile : the extent of the sea-coast is about three miles : the shore is flat and sandy, with a very shallow Bay at the mouth ofthe Ruail, which discharges itself into Loch Ridan. The climate is moist. Fuel is expensive. Lime-stone, and pipe-clay, are in great abundance. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. The celebrated Mathematician, Mr, Colin Mac laurin, late Professor of Mathematics in The University of Edinburgh ; and Mr. John Maclaurin, an eminent Divine, were born at the manse of this Parish, of which their father was Minister. The vale of Glendaruail owes much of it* beauty to the three principal Heritors who reside in it, viz., Duncan Campbell, Esq., of Glendaruail, John Campbell, Esq., of Ormadale, and Angus Fletcher, Esq., of Dounans; who, to the natural woods upon their estates, have added considerable plantations of Scotch fir, larch, and hard Wood. The late Mr. Campbell, of Ormadale, who had made the subject of wood his particular study, was very successful in adapting the different kinds to their proper soil, and has thereby both ornamented and improved the estate for his son. Were this subject generally attended to, much ofthe expense of procuring fuel might be saved to the Highlands, by planting coppices of quick growth in soils calculated for raising such kinds of wood : which, by being frequently cut over, would afford a cheaper and less precarious kind of fuel than peats, in this rainy climate. The Y2"], [178, "K I L Highland Cottages which, in general, are still wretched hovels with no chimnies, are not adapted for burning pit-coal, otherwise, all circumstances considered, this would perhaps be the cheapest fuel. The country is so much indented with arms of the sea, as that coals might be conveyed by water within a very few miles of most places ; and the good roads now making in all directions, render the land carriage very easy. Much praise is due to the late Duke of Argyle, and the Gentlemen of the County, who concurred with him, in obtaining an Act of Parliament which imposes an assessment of five per cent., upon the real rent of lands, for the purpose of making roads, and building bridges. The Gen tlemen of this District, instead of carrying their dead to a distant Church-yard, for the sake of burying in consecrated ground, generally inclose a small spot of ground near their houses, for a sepulchre. By a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in December 1804, by the great landed Proprietors of this District, it appears, \" That the Coun ties of Argyle, and of the Island of Bute, are much connected in the trade of fishing, and are still more connected in civil and military Policy, the Circuit Courts for both being holden twice in the year at Inverary, and the Counties having only one Regiment of Militia between them. \u2014 That the mak ing of a proper road between Inverary, and the Island of Bute, would there fore be highly beneficial to the Public, as well as accommodating to the Inhabitants of these parts, by shortening the communication of land not less than ninety seven miles out of one hundred and seventeen, the present Post-road from Inverary to Rothesay in Bute, by Dumbarton, Glasgow, Greenock, and Largs, being 117 miles, whereas the road proposed to be opened by the Memo rialists will only be twenty miles ; besides, the ferry from Bute to Largs in Ayr shire, which is the line of the present Post-road, is five or six miles wide, and often not passable, whereas the ferry from Bute to the proposed new road is not a quarter of a mile wide, and is passable at all times. \u2014 In Loch Fyne not fewer than 500 large herring-boats are annually employed ; and the Town of Rothesay annually sends out from eighty to ninety large vessels for the Bounty Fishing; which sufficiently shows the importance of establishing an easy com munication between these places, not only as enriching the country by the quan tity offish caught, but also as affording an extensive nursery for hardy seamen to the Royal Navy. \u2014 That in order to accomplish these very desirable National objects, the Memorialists propose that a Road shall be made from the Ferry of Cuilintrive, nearly opposite to the Town of Rothesay, along The Kyles of"], [179, "K I L Bute, and through the Valley of Glendaruail, to the line of road on the East side of Loch Fyne, which leads to Inverary, and communicates nearly in a straight line with the great line of road leading to Fort William and The Caledonian Canal. \u2014 That by making this road the communication between the Continent of Argyle and the extensive Islands of Bute and Arran, as well as the fishing Towns of Inverary and Rothesay, would be rendered much more certain, easy, and direcf, to the great advantage ofthe numerous Fishermen, as well as the other inhabit ants of these places, who are often put to much inconvenience in attending Circuit Courts and other public Meetings at Inverary, owing to the want of Bridges, and the almost impassable state of the tract through which it is proposed to carry the intended road. \u2014 That besides these great national and local advantages, this road would open up an extensive district of country, well adapted to the purposes of agriculture, and other improvements. \u2014 That the extent of this pro posed line of road, as already said, is about twenty miles; and the expense of making it, is computed at \u00a32500.\" \u2014 In the month of December 1805, the same Memorialists observe, that their application for the Parliamentary aid towards making a good road from Bute to Inverary, through the valley of Glendaruail, being granted by The Commissioners, a survey, plan, and estimate thereof had accordingly been made, and that the work would speedily commence. In their second Memorial they add, \" at the place marked on Mr. Langland's Plan, \" Ballochindrain,\" this road joins a line of road already made from the Ferry of Otter to the Ferry of Dunoou, being the direct and nearest communication from the Crinan Canal, and the villages now forming in its neighbourhood, to Green ock, and the other Towns on the Clyde, so that this may be considered a point from which four roads diverge, viz. The intended road leading up through the valley of Glendaruail to Inverary, \u2014 the continuation ofthe same road leading to Bute, \u2014 and, in the same manner, the road leading by Otter Ferry to the Crinan Canal, \u2014 and, by the Ferry of Dunoon, to Greenock. That to render the junction of all these roads complete, a Bridge will be necessary over the dangerous and rapid river of Glendaruail, in attempting to ford which, at this place, lives are lost almost every seas-on.\" This Bridge was accordingly finished about the year 1808, and is found to be of great utility to the Public. And, in consequence of a further Memorial of the Heritors of this Parish, on the 13th of January 1809, a branch of road from Ballochindrain Bridge to Loch Riddan head, a space of nearly two miles, and also a bridge to complete the road between the Ferries of"], [180, "K I L Dunoon and Otter, have been made. The Fairs are holden, in Glendaruail, on Monday before Whitsunday, and the second Tuesday, O. S., in October.

Much ofthe barren ground, and many ofthe hills almost to their summits, are covered with large plantations of Scotch fir, and a variety of natural wood : and many thousand fir-trees are annu ally cut in Lovat's, the Chisholm's, and Struie's woods. The Falls of Kill morack and Teanassie, the picturesque scenes in the Dreum, and the Island of Aigash, have often been admired by the man of taste. In every district of this extensive Parish, from the Village of Beauly upwards, even in the highest hills, there are Lakes, all plentifully stored with pike, and trout : but the most remark able is, Lochan Uain, or The Green Lake; it is on the Chisholm's property, about 40 miles to the West of Beauly, surrounded by mountains as lofty as any in Scotland ; the highest, is called Maum Souil: this Lake is constantly, both in summer and winter, covered with ice ; except in the middle of June, when the Sun is vertical, a very little ofthe ice in the center ofthe Lake is dissolved. Here is both a Parochial, and a Society's School. The Salmon fishery of the Beauly is the sole property of The Honourable Archibald Fraser, of Lovat.

Ardkinglass, late the residence of Sir Alexander Campbell, Bart., possesses every advantage from nature, lying close to the beautiful Lake of Loch Fyne : the house is new, large, and conve nient, but the architecture is by no means elegant : and the old Castle of Ardkinglass, a large and venerable pile of ruins, has been entirely demolished to make way for Offices! Sir Alexander Campbell dying in September 1810, without leaving any offspring, the title of Baronet is no longer in the family. The estate now belongs to Colonel Callander, of Craigforth, who will probably take the name of Campbell.

Sterling in money, and 16 stone weight of cheese : the manse is in good repair : the glebe contains 14 a.. 2 r..l5 f, besides an acre and a half Scotch measure, which has been possessed by the Minister for time immemorial, and is allowed to belong to the Church : Patron, The Crown : The Church, which is situate at Monaeburgh, was erected before the year 1586. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (comprising in The East Barony, Auchincloch,"], [190, "K I L Auchinrivoch.Banton, Cobziumboa, Dundaff, Tomfin, onrfThc District adjacent to the Town: \u2014 in Tlie West Barony, Balmalloch, Drumbreck, Old Place, and Quinzie : \u2014 the North-West, South-West, North-East, and South-East Quarters ofthe Town, and The New Town) was 1762, and, in 1811, was 3206. It is 35| m. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the second of January, the first Tuesday in March, the last Thursday in May, the 16th of August, and the 23d of November. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 3j miles in breadth : the general appearance is bleak, rugged, and elevated, commanding an extensive prospect : the soil is for the most part light and gravelly, and is tolerably fertile. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. It is watered by the river Kelvin on the South ; and on the East, \" The bonny Links of Carron water\" are well known, and justly deserve the appellation. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. It abounds with coal, and iron-stone ; in the Garrel Glen, there is a quarry ofthe finest white free-stone, of which upwards of a thousand Tons are annually sent to Glasgow by the Forth and Clyde Canal, and many streets in The New Town of Glasgow are paved with it : and near Auchensterrie Bridge, is a valuable and inexhaustible Quarry of basaltes or whin-stone, several thousand tons of which are yearly exported by the same Canal to Glasgow, and its neighbourhood. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and an excellent Dwelling-house and School ; and it is conducted by a Gentleman of a liberal education, excellent moral character and abilities ; and he takes boarders. There are private Schools also in different parts ofthe Parish. This Parish consists of two Baronies, The East, and The West: the former has for many ages been called Monaeburgh ; the latter, Killsyth, but until the year 1649, it belonged to the Parish of Campsie. The Heritors are not numerous, and few of them have property in it to a great extent: Sir Archibald Edmonstone, Bart., of Duntreath, is Proprietor of five sixths of the Parish, and Superior ofthe whole, except a valuation of \u00a380. Scotch : he is also Titular of the Teinds. At Wester- Wood, and Bar- Hill, there are two distinct Roman Forts, and of which plans are preserved by General Roy ; and opposite to them, are two Pictish Forts, one at Cunny Park, and the other at Balcastle or Castle Town, which is perhaps the most beautiful and entire Pictish Fort in Scotland. There are also several circular fortifications, called"], [191, "K I L Chesters, which bear evident marks of great antiquity. This Parish derives con siderable advantage from its vicinity to The Grand Forth aud Clyde Canal, which unites the Eastern and Western Seas. Killsyth formerly gave the title of Viscount to the Family of Livingstone, attainted in 1715. A few years ago, the bodies of Lady Killsyth, and an Infant, were discovered in a vault under the Church, preserved in an admirable manner. Here a victory was obtained by Montrose over The Covenanters, many of whom perished in a marsh. KILLTARLATY, in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Rectory and Vicar rage, with the Parish of Conveth united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 48 bolls 1 firlot 1 peck of barley, and \u00a3217..0..4. Scotch of money ; the Vicarage and grass-money, by a composition, is \u00a339. .19. .5. Sterling ; the glebe is rather larger than usual, but the soil is very thin and poor : Patron, The Honourable Archibald Fraser, of Lovat : The Church is dedicated to St. Thalargus. It is in the Presbytery of Inverness, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2588, and, in 1811, was 2601. It is 3 in. S. W. from Beauly. This Parish is at least 30 measured miles from the North-East to the North-West extremity, and is, at an average, 6 miles broad, containing 91,638 Scotch acres ; of which, 3054 are arable, the same extent under meadow grass, and the remainder under Wood and heath. The climate is salubrious. It is watered by the river Beauly, which is formed by the two rivers Farrar, and Glass ; and which abounds with salmon, and different kinds of trout. The prin cipal Lakes are, Loch Bruiach, Loch Neattie, and Loch Gorm. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 18 bolls 1 firlot and 2 pecks of barley, together with School-fees. In the heights of this Parish, and that of Killmorack, a Missionary officiates, who is paid by the Royal bounty : he has four different places of preaching, and some of them at a considerable distance from each other, so that this is a laborious charge. The Language principally spoken here is the Gaelic. There are several peat-mosses, of great extent, in the Parish. Beaufort, the pre sent Seat of the Family of Lovat, is built on a part ofthe ground, originally occupied by a Fortress ; it lies about a mile to the North of the Church, on a beautiful eminence, near the river Beauly, and is surrounded by extensive plan tations, made by The Honourable Archibald Fraser. Belladrum is the Seat of Major Fraser ; and Bruiach, that of Colonel Fraser, both of which Gentle men are indefatigable in their improvements ofthe country, and their desire to promote the comforts and happiness of their Tenantry. There are six Druidical Temples, within a mile ofthe present Church ; one of them being in the Church- vol. ii. A a"], [192, "K I L yard. About two miles North-West from the Church, by the side of the river Beauly, is a vitrified Fort, called Dun- Thionn, or Fingals Fort : it is a complete circle, of about 60 yards in circumference, situate on the summit of a conical hill, which is only accessible on the East side. About two miles due East from the Church, is Castle Spynnie, or The Fortress of the Spoil: it is 54 yards in cir cumference, the walls being 9 or 10 feet thick, built of dry stones without cement: it stands on the summit of a hill, about 700 feet above the plain below, and commands a most extensive prospect. This Parish abounds with game. KILLTEARN, in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 136 bolls of victual, one half oatmeal, and the other half barley, and \u00a332. Sterling : the manse, and offices, were built in 1762 ; the glebe consists of 4 acres of arable land : Patron, The Crown : The Chuch was hand- somely re-built in 1790. It is in the Presbytery of Dingwall, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1525, and, in 1811, was 1552. It is 8 m. N. N. E. from Dingwall. This Parish is situate in the District of Ferindonald, stretching along the North side ofthe Firth of Cromarty for about six miles : its breadth is various ; but the cultivated land extends two miles from the sea shore : and there are several grazings at the distance of 5, 10, and even 15 miles from the coast. The Highland district is, for the most part, wild and uncultivated, consisting of lofty mountains, separated from each other by rapid rivulets, and extensive tracts of muir and mossy ground : In this district is a considerable Strath, called The Clare, upon the banks ofthe river Skiack ; in which are the goat-whey quarters ofthe Minister of Killtearn, and of Mr. Munro, Sheriff-Substitute of Lewis. Ben-Uaish, the most lofty moun- tain, is mostly covered with snow ; and, in allusion to this circumstance, the Family of Foiclis hold the Forest of Uaish, on condition of the payment of a snow-ball to His Majesty on any day ofthe year, if required ; and, it is said, that a quantity of snow was actually sent to The Duke of Cumberland in the summer of 1746, when at Inverness, to cool his wine : this Forest is well stocked with deer, and a variety of moor game. The climate is pure, and healthy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Parochial School is conducted with great attention, and success. At Balcony, Fowlis, and Ardullie Point, vessels of from 80 to 100 tons load and unload, and anchor with the greatest safety. Free-stone, of excellent quality, is in abundance. The Gaelic is the language commonly here. There are several cairns, and tumuli ; and also the ruins of five chapels, at tbe church-yard of one of which, near the sea-shore, called St. Mary's"], [193, "K I L Chapel, several families still continue to bury their dead. About five-sixths of the Parish belong to the Munros, of Foiclis, a family long and deservedly dis tinguished for the eminent and military characters which it has produced ; of their martial spirit, Buchanan takes notice, and a comprehensive account of this ancient and truly respectable family is given in the Appendix to the Life of Colonel Gardiner, by the late Dr. Doddridge. KILLVICEUEN, v. KILLFINICHEN. KILL-VORRIE, v. STRATH-LACHLAN. KILLWINNING, or SAIG-TOWN, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse was built in 1773, and is in excellent repair : the glebe consists of between 4 and 5 acres : Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church is a very beautiful structure, built partly in the Gothic style, to correspond with the vener able ruins ofthe Monastery. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2700, and, in 1811, was 3291. It is 3| m. N. N. W. from Irvine. A Fair is holden here annually on the first day of February, called Winning's day Fair. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and nearly the same in breadth. It is partly a strong clay soil, and partly a light sand, and loam : the whole is inclosed, and agriculture is much attended to. The surface is beautifully diversified with many rising grounds ; the summits of which, particularly in the neighbourhood ofthe Town, are covered with extensive and flourishing plantations. The cli mate is rainy. Coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, of excellent quality, are in great abundance. It is watered by the Garnock, and the Lugton one oi its tri butary streams, both of which are well stocked with fish ; as well as the Lake, called The Ashen-Yard Loch. The roads are in bad repair. A great part of the Parish is heavily thirled to the Killwinning Mill, called The Abbey Mill, and to the mill of Seven Acres, the property of Lord Eglintoun : some farms paying no less than the twelfth peck, as multure. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a School-house, School fees, and other emoluments. Eglintoun Castle, which has been the seat of the Ancient and Noble family of Montgomerie, Earl of Eglintoun, for upwards of 400 years, is surrounded with plantations and pleasure grounds, containing 2000 Scotch acres, laid out in the finest taste ; \u2014 a family, eminently remarkable for their Patriotism, their Loyalty, their high sense of Honour, and distinguished Abilities in Peace and War! \u2014 The Abbey was founded in the year 1140, by Hugh de Moreville, Lord High Aa2"], [194, "K I L Constable of Scotland, for Monks ofthe Tyronensian Order, brought from Kelso, and dedicated to St. Winning. The buildings of this House, when entire, ac cording to tradition, occupied several acres : but at present their situation cannot be exactly traced out. In 1560, Alexander, Earl of Glencairn, one ofthe most distinguished and active promoters of the Reformation, in consequence of an order from the States of Scotland, in a great measure demolished this stately and beautiful pile. A few years afterwards, part ofthe Abbey Church was repaired, and converted into the Parish Church ; and, as such, it was used till about the year 1775, when being found ruinous and unsafe, it was wholly taken down, and a very elegant modern Church was erected on its site : in 1789, the steeple was repaired at the expense of The Earl of Eglintoun. The last Commendator of this Abbey was Gavin Hamilton, a firm and zealous friend ofthe Queen Regent, and of her beautiful but unfortunate daughter, Queen Mary ; and was employed by them in several important negotiations : he was killed in the Canongate of Edinburgh, on the 28th of June, 1571. At the general Dissolution of Religious Houses, Alexander, Earl of Glencairn, obtained a grant of this Abbey, on the resignation of Mr. William Melville, of the family of Raith: and, on the 5th of January 1603, Hugh, Earl of Eglintoun, got a new grant of the same, with all the lands and tythes, and patronage ofthe Churches, at that time belonging to it, either in property or superiority, which were erected into a Temporal Lord ship to him and his heirs : it would seem that the lands of the Barony afterwards passed into the family of Balfour; but they were again restored, in 1615, to Hugh, the fifth Earl of Eglintoun, with whose successors they still remain. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of it. Killwinning is celebrated for being the seat of the first Mason Lodge in Scotland, which was erected here about the middle ofthe Twelfth Century. Archery was also very early established here, and a prize is still annually shot for, by the Burgesses ofthe Town. KILLYSPENDY, v. ABER-LADY. KILLYSPENDY, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Rait united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe lies detached in several different places, and some part of it is a rugged bank, but there are 6 or 7 acres of it, of a tolerably good soil: Patron, Mr. Robertson, of Killyspendy: The Church is in tolerable condi tion. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 762, and, in 1811, was 762. It is 3 m. N.W. from Errol. This Parish lies partly in the Carse of Gowrie,"], [195, "K I N and partly among the Stormont hills, extending about 5 miles in length, and 3f miles in breadth. The hills are barren, and covered with heath ; but the glens, and low ground, are exceedingly fertile, and well cultivated. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy. Coals are the general fuel. The roads are indifferent. KILSPINDIE, v. KILLYSPENDY. KILSTAY, BAY, v. KIRK-MAIDEN. KINBEACHY, v. URQUHART. KINBLYTHMONT, v. INVER-KEILOR. KINCAID, or EASTER FIELD, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Par ish of Campsie. In 1785, Messrs. Henderson, Semple, and Company, erected a very extensive Calico Printfield, upon this Farm, which they have rented from the Laird of Kincaid : and where they have also constructed a set of works for the manufacture of all kinds of grain. Several ofthe Printers have feued stead ings on the grounds, and a neat Village has now arisen in consequence of these Works. KINCALDRUM, HOUSE, v. INVERARITY. KINCARDINE, in the Shire of Kincardine ; and in the Parish of Fordoun. It is 5 m. N. W. from Laurence Kirk. This Village gives name to the Shire, and was anciently the Shire Town, until the reign of James the Sixth ; who re moved the Courts from Kincardine to Stonehaven, and which has continued to enjoy that privilege ever since. Here are the ruins of a Castle, which is said to have been a Royal Palace, belonging to Kenneth the Third, where he sometimes resided; and who was killed by St.Finella, during his progress from thence to Fordoun, to worship at the Shrine of St. Palladius. That St. Fi nella had her residence in this neighbourhood is highly probable ; as the Hill, which runs between Fordoun and Kincardine, bears the name of Strath Finella. Here the unfortunate Baliol made his submission to Edward the First, on the 2d of July 1296. At Clattering -Bridge, there was a Roman Fort, which is now known by the name of The Green Castle : it was advantageously placed here, according to Mr. Chalmers, who has given a plan and section of it, for the obvious purpose of guarding the well known passage, through the Grampian mountains by the Cairn-o '-mount, into the valley of The Mearns. KINCARDINE, in the Shire of Perth, though locally situate in the Shire of Fife ; and in the Parish of Tulliallan. It is 25 m. W. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Markets are on Wednesday, and Saturday, and are well supplied. A Gen eral Post-Office is established here. This Village is pleasantly situate on the"], [196, "K I N Northern bank ofthe Forth, and was originally called West Pans, from the num ber of Salt Pans that were worked in it, amounting in 1780 to 15, though they are now reduced in number to two or three. Here is a valuable salmon fishery in the Forth, by means of cruives. The harbour is commodious ; and opposite to the Village is an excellent roadsted, where numerous Vessels of any burden may ride in safety. Ship-building is carried on to a great extent here. It is subject to the Jurisdiction of the Custom-house of Alloa. There is a regular Passage boat between Kincardine, and Higgin's Neuk. It was from this Barony, that the Ancient and Illustrious family of Bruce took the title of Earl, now conjoined with Elgin. KINCARDINE, in the Shire of Perth ; formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 16 bolls of bear, 64 bolls of oat-meal, and \u00a345. in money : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of 5f acres : Patron, Lady Perth : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunblane, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Norriston, and Thornhill) was 2212, and, in 1811, Avas 2419. It is 6 m. N. W. from Stirling. This Parish contains upwards of 6000 acres ; of which, about 4000 acres are carse lands, lying along the Forth, and the remainder dry-field, upon the banks of the Teith. Agriculture is much attended to here, and inclosures are become general : But the greatest exertions that have been made in the way of improvement, have been the cultivation of the Moss of Kincardine, on the estate of Blair Drummond, which originally covered 1800 acres : and where various Roman antiquities have been discovered. The climate is rainy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Blair- Drummond, the Seat of Drummond Home, Esq. , is an elegant House, surrounded with extensive plantations. KINCARDINE, partly in the Shire of Ross, and partly in the Shire of Cro marty : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was only \u00a370. Sterling .- the manse is in decent repair : Patron, The Honourable Mrs. Mac kenzie : The Church is in tolerable condition : besides which, there are two Preachiug stations, viz., Amat in Strath Carron, and Doun in Strath Oigeal, the one 10, and the other 14 miles distant from the manse. It is in the Pres bytery of Tam, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1865, and, in 1811, was 1666. It is 14 m. W. b. N. from Tain. This Parish is upwards of 30 miles in length, stretching along the Southern shore of the Firth of Tain : at the East end it is very narrow, but widens gradually to the"], [197, "K I N Western extremity, where the great Forest of Balnagown is situate, and which is remarkable for the large size of its Deer. The soil is various ; and it is princi pally mountainous, and appropriated to pasturage ; though there are about 3000 acres of arable, and meadow land. Game is abundant. On Craig chonichan the gallant Marquis of Montrose fought his last battle, and was defeated by Colonel Strachan. The Fair is holden in the last week in November. Here Janet Macleod, the remarkable fasting woman, resided ; who is particularly mentioned in Mr. Pennant's Tour, vol. iii. p. 393. Balnagown is a Seat of Sir Charles Ross, Bart., Chief ofthe ancient and powerful Clan of Ross. KINCARDINE, CASTLE, v. BLACKFORD. KINCARDINE O'NEIL, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Rectory, belonging to the Chapter of Aberdeen ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : the manse is in good repair: Patron, Sir William Forbes, Bart. : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1710, and, in 1811, was 1645. It is 112 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Fair is holden on the second Wednesday and Thursday in September. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the banks of the Dee, commanding an extensive prospect up that river, towards the Grampian Mountains, and is much resorted to as a place of Summer retirement by Invalids. This Parish contains about 5560 acres of arable land, and a considerable quantity of muir, which is appro priated to the pasturage of black cattle, and sheep. Peats are the common fuel. Free-stone is abundant. Here is a Parochial School. Near the Town, is a neat and commodious House, lately built by Mr. Grant, and surrounded by about 300 acres of plantation. Here was an ancient Hospital, founded before the year 1296. By a Memorial presented by John Gordon, Esq., of Craigmile, and other great landed Proprietors, in the month of June 1810, to The Commis sioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, it appears, that \" the great Military road leading from Brechin by Fettercairn, Kincardine O'Neil, and the Boat of Forbes, to Huntley, and which is commonly called Cairn O Mount Road, from its being carried through a very difficult Pass ofthe Grampians, has been long very much frequented by travellers, and by the Miliary in their passage to and from Fort George, and in general is ofthe greatest consequence to the Commer cial interests of a large District of country to the Northward, in so much, as the distance from Brechin to Huntley is thereby shortened at least 20 miles. This"], [198, "K I N road is intersected by the river Dee, near Kincardine O'Neil, and by the river Don at the Boat of Forbes. Both these rivers are large and rapid, particularly the Dee, generally reckoned the third river in Scotland. This river descends from a mountainous and highly elevated District, and either when in floods in the Summer and Autumn months from heavy falls of rain, or in Spring from melting ofthe Snow in the Upper District, or in Winter when gorged with ice, the passage of Kincardine O'Neil is rendered extremely precarious, and often impracticable altogether for days. The interruption occasioned to, and the danger incurred by, travellers on this road, from the want of bridges on these rivers, has been long severely felt, and for more than a century past it has been in contemplation to build a bridge over the Dee, at a place called Potarch, a little below Kincardine O'Neil, and in the line of this road. This place possesses superior advantages for the site of a bridge to any other situation on the river Dee, and perhaps almost any other river whatever. Here a ridge of solid rock extends completely across the river, through a fissure or opening, in which the river in its ordinary state flows. The Memorialists and their Predecessors, fully sensible ofthe necessity for such a bridge, hav\u00a7 made frequent attempts to raise money by subscription for that purpose, but unfortunately these attempts have always hitherto proved abortive, and the accomplishment of this desirable object, from such repeated failures, was almost despaired of. The Memorialists, how ever, encouraged by the aid promised by Government to such necessary under takings in similar situations, have again set on foot a subscription, which they have no doubt will soon be filled up ; but, that no time may be lost, they have obtained a plan, section, specification, and estimate of a bridge, including the necessary embankments proposed to be built over the river Dee at Potarch, which are herewith forwarded, and humbly submitted to the consideration of The Commissioners.\" \u2014 The same Memorialists in another Memorial observe, \" the long-wished for bridge on the river Dee, near Kincardine O'Neil, it is hoped, will now be obtained by aid from Government and voluntary contribution ; and which bridge being once built, it then remains to have proper communica tion roads South and North from the same. On the North side of the river there is only one road at present, which runs in a Northward direction towards the Boat of Forbes on the river Don; and in the humble opinion ofthe Memorialists, as well as that of other Gentlemen connected with that mountainous District of country betwixt the Dee and Don, another road running from the site of the proposed bridge, through the wood of Cordach, by the Mill of Mid-beltie and"], [199, "K I N Torsins Northward, till it joins the Mid-Mar turnpike road at the farm of Tillen turk, in all a distance of about 7 miles in length, and from its direction would be ofthe utmost consequence to the Public in general, as well as this District of the country in particular.\" \u2014 The Commissioners, in their Fifth Report of April 1811, remark, \" We hereupon directed Mr. Telford to examine the spot (at Potarch) in August last, and to suggest any improvements which might occur to him in the plan proposed by the Memorialists : and he has found it expedient to prepare a new plan and estimate, with accurate specifications ofthe required workmanship. The Bridge, as now proposed, is to consist of three arches, the middle arch to be of 70 feet span, the total water-way 200 feet. We have trans mitted this new plan to the Memorialists, and hold ourselves ready to proceed upon it so soon as they shall have paid the necessary moiety of the estimate into the Bank of Scotland.\" KINCARDINE, SHIRE, or THE MEARNS. This Shire is about 30 miles in length, and 20 miles in breadth, stretching along the German Ocean. A part ofthe Grampian mountains runs through it, and forms the North side of The How or Hollow of Tfte Mearns, the North-Eastern extremity of Strathmore: South ofthe Grampians, the soil is in general fertile ; and, since the late intro duction of the improvements in agriculture, the appearance has been greatly improved. It is divided into 19 Parishes ; the Resident Population of which, in 1801, was 26,349, and, in 1811, was 27,439. It sends one Member to Parliament. KINCHARDINE, or KINIE CHAIRDIN, i. e. The Clan of Friends, in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Vicarage, united to the Parish of Aber-Nethy : Patron, The Earl of Seafield : The Church is a good plain building, 8 miles distant from Aber-Nethy ; the Church-yard is inclosed with a wall and hedge, and a belt of wood about three yards broad. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-r Nethy, and Synod of Moray. It is 4 m. N. E. from Aviemore. Here is one of the Society's Schools, with a Salary of \u00a39., and one ofthe best School-houses in the Highlands. It is situate on the Eastern bank of the river Spey. The Barony of Kinchardine is the property of The Duke of Gordon. Here are several Lakes; the most considerable of which, is Loch Morlich, situate in the bottom ofthe glen in Glenmore, and which is nearly two miles in diameter. The Cairn Gorm, or Blue Mountain, is the most remarkable range of mountains that bound this Parish to the Southward : its altitude is 4050 feet above the level ofthe sea, and 1780 feet above Loch Avon, from whence the river of that name issues, and vol. ii.

Mr. Wallace very poetically thus describes Cairn Gorm : \u2014 \" His crumbled rocks are strew'd with brilliant gems, Whose brightness, sparkling in Altera's hair, Or blissful on her panting bosom hung, The Topaz envies.\" \u2014 The Resident Population ofthe Parish of Kinchardine, in 1801, was 530, and, in 1811, was 72 1 .

It is in the Presbytery ofDunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the small Villages of Arntully, and Knockshinan) was 1035, and, in 1811, was 1066. It is 5 m. S. b. W. from Blair-Gowrie. This Parish is pleasantly situate in the District of Stormont, stretching along the Southern and Western banks ofthe river Tay, over which there is a Ferry, with a good and commodious Inn. The soil is mostly light, and sharp ; but agriculture is particularly attended to here. The elimate is mild, and healthy The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, and perquisites. The thirlage is in some places considerably high, and is considered as a great hardship. The ruins of Kinclaven Castle, on the banks ofthe Tay, show it to have been formerly a place of great strength. Kinclaven gave the title of Baron to the family of Stewart, in 1652. KINCRAIG, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 646, and, in 1811, was 621. It is \\\\ m. \u00a7. E. from Perth. This Parish contains about 3780 Scotch acres ; of which 2520 are rich arable land, and well cultivated ; and the remainder are under flourishing plantations. The air is exceedingly pure, and healthful. The Tay, which abounds with excellent salmon, and fine trout of different kinds, is here navigable for vessels, cutter built, of 100 tons burden : the neap tides rising 6, and the spring tides from 9 to 10s feet. The Roads are in good repair. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and per quisites, and a School-house, and dwelling. Coals are in plenty, and at a moderate rate. The Estate and Barony of Kinfauns formerly belonged to Sir Thomas Charteris, commonly called Thomas de Longueville, the faithful friend of Sir William Wallace, and whose antique sword is still preserved in the Castle : it afterwards belonged to a Gentleman ofthe name of Carnegie, of the family of Northesk : from whom it passed to that of Blair, whose heiress was married to John Lord Gray, an ancestor of the present Noble Proprietor. In the Castle of Kinfauns, which stands upon an eminence, overlooking the Tay, is a large iron vane, with the date 1688 cut in the middle ; and which was wont to be placed on the top ofthe building. This was a mark, or badge of an Herit able office, or power of Admiralty over the river, annexed to the estate of Kinfauns, for preserving the fishery, and punishing all trespasses committed in destroying the salmon. In a Charter under the Great Seal, in the year 1671, the old Jurisdiction is explained and confirmed ; and, according to the tradition ofthe country, it was acknowledged by all vessels passing in the Tay, by a salute, or lowering of their colours to the Castle. This power extends from Drumlie Sands below Dundee, to the heart of the river, and entitles the family of Kinfauns to a salmon annually, out of every fishing-boat on the river Tay. KINGARTH, in the Island, and Shire of Bute : formerly a Prebend, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 78 bolls of victual, half meal, half barley, the meal at 9 stone weight per boll, and the barley at 4 firlots per boll, together with \u00a336.. 15. .4. Sterling in money: the manse, and offices, were built in 1769: Patron, The Marquis of Bute, who is almost the sole Proprietor ofthe Parish: There are three Churches ; one of them, which is built near the South end, is Bb2"], [202, "K I N very ancient, and is now almost in ruins ; the second, which is erected on the Shore, near Mount Stuart House, has Divine Service performed in it only when any ofthe Family are there ; the third is the ordinary place of Worship, and is called The Mid Kirk, from its central situation. It is in the Presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 875, and, in 1811, was 854. It is 5| m. S. from Rothesay. This Parish if about 7 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, lying in the Southern extremity ofthe Island: when viewed at a distance, the surface has a flat appearance, although there is a gradual ascent from the East and West shores to the middle ofthe Parish : the soil is light and sandy, but very fertile; and nearly the whole is inclosed. About one half of the rents is paid in barley ; and the remainder in oats, and cattle. The herring fishery is pursued with great success here. Game, and aquatic birds, of various kinds, are abundant. The climate, though damp, is mild and temperate, and very healthy. The Gaelic language is the most prevalent. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and a rood of land. At the North-West side of the Parish, the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge have established a School, with a Salary of \u00a36., a free house, kale yard, and a cow, maintained summer and winter by the District : There is also a third School in the North-West quarter, the teacher of which is paid by the resident Inhabitants there. The great disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the want of coal. There is a ready sale for every kind of produce, either at Rothesay, Greenock, or the Largs. Two Packets sail every week from Rothesay, and a Ferry-boat once every week from Scoulay, near Mount Stuart, to the Largs. Few ofthe Inhabitants export their own commodities ; as buyers come to the Island, and are at the expense of ferrying them over to the other side. Mount Stuart, the elegant Seat of The Marquis of Bute, is delightfully situate near the Eastern shore , and is surrounded with beautiful and extensive Planta tions ; and from hence His Lordship takes his second title of Baron. This is the only Parish in the Synod of Argyle, where the Minister does not officiate in the Gaelic language. According to Mr. Pennant, two Cemeteries belong to the old Church, a higher and a lower : the last was allotted for the interment of females only, because, in old times, certain women being employed to carry a quantity of Holy earth, brought from Rome, lost some by the way, and so incurred this penalty for their negligence, \u2014 that of being buried separately from the other sex. Near this is a circular inclosure, of excellent masonry, but without mortar, called The Devil's Cauldron."], [203, "K I N KINGCAUSIE, v. MARY CULTER.

Customs and personal services are nearly abolished. The Heritors ofthe estate of Bahnad enjoy only the increase of rent which has taken place since the year 1750, when it was sold by King's College ; as the rent, which it bore at the time ofthe sale, continues to be paid to the said Col lege and the School of Fordyce. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a316., together with School-fees, and perquisites The Public roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. Peats are the common fuel.

Kinghorn was invested with the privileges of a Royal Burgh by King David the First, and, about that time, is said to have been a Royal Residence. It is pleasantly situate on the side of a hill, fronting the Firth of Forth, and consists of one principal street, inter- sected by cross lanes. In the centre ofthe Town is an ancient building, called St. Leonard's Tower, now used as the Court-House, and common Prison. The trade is inconsiderable. A cotton and flax manufactory has lately been esta- blished. Kinghorn, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Dysart, Kirkaldy, and Burnt-Island, sends one Member to Parliament ; the Number of Voters being Four, and the Delegate for Kinghorn, in turn with the other three Burghs, is the Returning Borough. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is paid wholly by the Town, is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perqui- sites, and a dwelling, and small garden. It has two Harbours ; one of them below the Town, which is called The Kirk-Harbour, from its vicinity to I he Church, and another, called the Petty Cur, at about half a mile's distance to the South-West: the former of these is of very ancient date; but the latter is of modern erection, as a more convenient situation for the passage over the Forth to Leith, and, lately, a Light-House has been built at the extremity of the Quay, for the benefit ofthe Passage-boats. A little to the Westward ofthe Petty- Cur the land rises very high, forming a precipice, which used formerly to be a Wood; over which precipice Alexander King of Scotland was killed while hunting, and whose death was the occasion of much bloodshed. The Rock is called The King's- Wood End. Near this, is a medicinal Spring, commonly called the Kinghorn Spa, the waters of which were much celebrated by Dr. Anderson, Physician to Charles the First, who wrote a Treatise upon their nature and properties, with directions for using them. The Parish of King- horn contains about 3400 acres, stretching along the coast for about 3 miles : the surface is beautifully diversified, and the soil is fertile. Coals are abundant.

KINGOODY, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Long-Forgan."], [206, "K I N This village is built on the Estate of Mr. Mylne, of Mylnefield, to accommodate the numerous labourers in the Quarry of Kingoody. The stone of this Quarry is of a grey colour, and of that kind of free-stone which is termed Grain-stone by Mineralogists : it is difficult to \"work, but is hard and durable to an uncom mon degree. This is certainly the best stone for building in Scotland; and, as it produces slabs of any size, it is much in demand, and is exported to a consi derable distance. The navigable Canal, called Tlie Gippon's Navigation, near Ipswich, and the Chelmsford Canal, in Essex, were both of them furnished with stone from this Quarry. KINGORNY, v. KINNEFF.

Lime-stone is abundant ; and an excellent quarry has been opened on the estate of The Right Honourable The Earl of Kellie. This Parish is said to have received its name from some Royal Store-houses, which were erected here by King John, when he resided at a Castle nearly half a mile distant, which was demolished some years ago. Cambo House, the ele gant residence of The Earl of Kellie, stands near the sea-shore, about a mile from the Village.

E. from Pitmain. This Parish is situate in the District of Badenoch, and is nearly 17 miles from East to West, and upwards of 20 miles from North to South : but of this extent, only the low part and the glens along the rivers are well inhabited, the rest being in general a range of hills appropriated to pas turage, where only a few Hamlets are thinly scattered, for the accommodation of those who attend their cattle during the Summer months. In the lower grounds, the soil is a mixture of sand and mud, deposited by the inundations of the river Spey, to which they are subject : the other parts consist of a light loam, and clay. The climate is cold, and unhealthy: storms are fre quent at all seasons ; frosts are uncommonly intense ; and as they continue late in spring, and begin early in autumn, with heavy falls of rain during the harvest months, crops are always rendered uncertain. The river Spey, intersects the Paris-h from East to West, winding in a number of beautiful curves, through a rich fertile meadow ; besides which, it is watered by the Truim, Colder, Tromie, Gynag, and Fe side ; all of them abounding with trout, and some of them with pike, salmon, and char. The hills abound with a great variety, and plenty of game. The village of Kingussie is neat, and thriving. The Gaelic language is most frequently spoken, though the English is tolerably well understood by many of the Inhabitants. There was formerly a Monastery in this Parish, and also a Priory with very liberal endowments, but very little is known concerning them.

The Rector of Kinkell was formerly of great importance in the Chapter of Aberdeen; for he was Parson of the seven Churches of Kinkell, Kintore, Kinnellar, Skene, Kemnay, Dyce, and Drumblade. This Patronage, and Parsonage, by the influence of Arch bishop Sharp, about the year 1662, were annexed to the Principal of St. Leon ard's College, in St. Andrew's. Here was anciently a House of the Knights' Templars. KINKELL, CASTLE, in the Shire of Nairn, though locally situate in the Shire of Ross ; in the Parish of Urquhart.

The Public Roads are in good repair. The hill of Cochrage, belonging to Colonel John Campbell, of Achal ader, is of considerable extent, and affords a plentiful supply of peat-moss. Game, of various kinds, is abundant. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks,"], [209, "K I N and perquisites. The principal manufacture here is that of linen. At Glass clune is an ancient Castle, now the property of Colonel Campbell.

The air is sharp, dry, and healthy. The Findhorn is the only river in the Parish ; it runs South and West, and falls into the Moray Firth at the Village of Findhorn ; it abounds with sal mon. In 1150, a famous Abbey was founded here by David the First, for monks ofthe Cistertian Order. Boethius, in speaking of this place, informs us, that there was a bridge upon the water, under which Duffus, king of Scotland, who had been murdered by thieves, was concealed ; but, on the discovery of his body, it was removed to Iona, and there interred with the respect due to his merit. Near the Abbey, is an orchard of apple and pear trees, which are said to be coeval with the last Monks. At the Reformation, Mr. Edward Bruce was Commendator ; who, procuring the lands to be erected into a Temporal Lordship, was, in 1604, created Baron Bruce, of Kinloss, by King James the Sixth : to this Dignity his son Thomas Bruce succeeded, and who, in 1633, was created Earl of Elgin, by Charles the First. The Abbey Lands, and Superiorities, are now the property of Miss Brodie, of Lethen: but, in 1651 and 1652, the stones of the Abbey were taken away, to build the citadel at Inverness.

The air is moist, but not unhealthy. Considerable plantations have lately been made here. The Salary of the Parochial School, including School-fees, and perquisites, is upwards of \u00a318. Sterling per annum. Near the Church are the ruins ofthe old Castle of Kinnaird; the Barony lands of which belonged originally to the Noble family of that name, by a grant from one ofthe Kings of Scotland ; and from them they derived their name and Baronial title, though no part ofthe Estate is now in their possession. KINNAIRD, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Larbert. It is 3| m. N. from Falkirk. Here are extensive Collieries ; and also a School, for the benefit of the children of the workmen.

This Parish contains 6408 English acres ; nearly two-thirds of which are arable, and cultivated on the principles of Mr. Barclay, of Ury; a Gentleman, whose acknowledged merit entitles him to have his name transmitted to posterity as the first, the most extensive, and judicious systematic improver of land in the North of Scot land. The coast is bold, and rocky. The air is very healthy. The only fuel used here is coals, either Scotch or English. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, and perquisites. The Public, and Private Roads are very indifferent. This Parish is supposed to have taken its name from a Castle, erected by one of the Scottish Kings called Kenneth, and to have been a Royal residence : the ruins of it are still to be seen on the margin ofthe sea, about 100 yards from the Church. There are also the remains of a Religious House, called St. Arnty's Kill, probably St. Arnold's Cell, situate between the Church and the Castle. Upon Kingorny are the remains of a small Chapel, said to be erected on the very spot where King David Bruce, landing from France in 1342, with his Queen and retinue, had High Mass performed for his return ; and it is thought to have been a Royal Chapel for some time after. Near the Castle of Kinneff, and beyond a small head-land about one hundred paces North-East, are the remains of an old work, upon the summit of a peninsular rock, called The Castle of Cadden : A little farther, is another peninsular rock, upon which are the ruins of a small house and other buildings, called The Castle of Whistleberry : And still farther to the North-East, are the remains of a third fortress, very much like that of Cadden in every respect, but much larger, called Adam's Castle. The rocks upon the coast are used for mill-stones, and are in great repute for that purpose. KINNEIL, in the Shire of Linlithgow : an ancient Rectory, now compre hended in the Parish of Borrowstown-Ness : The ruins ofthe Church, with its burying-ground, are still to be seen, a little Westward from Kinneil House.

A considerable part ofthe Parish is inclosed, and great attention is paid to the improvements in agriculture here. The climate is pure, and salubrious. Opposite to the Church, the river Tay divides itself into two parts, and forms a small Island ; one half of which is in this Parish, and the other in the Parish of Perth ; that branch of the river which belongs to Kinnoul, is called The Willow Gate, and admits the navigation of boats, and small sloops. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is well conducted, is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a free house, and garden. The Public roads are in good repair.

S. of October. This town is pleasantly situate in an extensive plain, at the Western extremity of Loch Leven. It is the Capital of the Shire, and the Seat of the Sheriff, Justice of Peace, and Baron Baillie Courts. It was formerly famous for its Cutlery ; at present, the principal manufacture is a coarse kind of linen, called Silesias: some branches ofthe Cotton manufacture have also lately been introduced. The Salary of the School, which is in a very flourishing state, is 300 merks, with a good house and small garden, and about an acre and a half of land. The Parish of Kinross extends about three miles in every direction : the surface is flat, and the soil partly a strong clay, but chiefly a thin light black earth, on a gravelly bottom. A spirit of industry, and a taste for improvement prevail here ; and, in order to excite emulation among the servants, an annual Ploughing-match has been established, with suitable prizes. Much flax is raised both for the Market, and for private use. It is watered by the three small rivers, the North and South Quiech, and the Gairney, which flow into Loch Leven vol. h.

This is a very small Shire, containing only four entire Parishes ; the Resident Population of which, in 1801, was 6725, and, in 1811, was 7245. The surface has in many parts a rich and beautiful appearance ; and coals, and limestone, are abundant. The Shires of Kinross, and Clack mannan, alternately divide the right of sending a Member to Parliament. KINTAIL, in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was upwards of \u00a3150. Sterling, and a glebe: Patron, The Crown: The Church, which is called Kill- Dutch, is in excellent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Loch-Carron, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1038, and, in 1811, was 1058. It is situate at the Eastern extremity of Loch Duich. This Parish is about 13 miles in length, and in general 6 computed miles in breadth ; comprehending the three Districts of The Side of Croe, Glen-Elchaig, and Glasletter. It is surrounded with lofty hills; the most eminent of which is Tulloch-Ard, and which commands an extensive view of the Hebrides. This mountain claims particular attention, on accoimt of the veneration in which it was holden in ancient times : like the temple of Janus, it indicated peace or war ; the voice of hostility was sure to roar upon its summit : for, when war commenced, a burning barrel of tar, on the highest ridge, was the signal ; and all the vassals and tenants of Seaforth appeared next morning, armed pro aris et focis, at the Castle of Donan, the usual place of rendezvous. This burning Mount the family of Seaforth bear for their Crest : and those who relish the music of the bagpipe, show no little regard to the tune of Tulloch-Ard, or Seaforth's gathering. The chief production is black cattle. Fuel is scarce. There is a Parochial School at The Side of Croe, with a Salary of 300 merks : and another School at Glen-Elchaig, supported by subscription from the Tenants. There is"], [217, "K I N also a Catechist at Glen-Elchaig, with a small Salary ; and the Priest lives in the Town of Dornie, where he has built a dwelling ; but he has no Meeting house. Here is a mortification of 50,000 merks Scotch, by the late Mr. Alexander Macrae, of Dornie; which is under the management of The King's College of Aberdeen, for educating the children of his nearest descendants. The Castle of Donan was built in the reign of Alexander the Third of Scotland, to resist the depredations of the Danes : it had the full command of Loch-Duich and Loch-Long, so far as to secure the Parish from annoyance by water : Colin Fitz-Gerald, from whom the present family of Seaforth is descended, was made Constable of this Castle, for the valour which he displayed at the battle of Largs, in 1263 : at full sea, it is surrounded by water, and formed into an island ; but at ebb, it is connected with the main-land. It was demolished in 1719, after the battle of Glen-Shiel, by a ship of war. Lord Seaforth, who is a principal Proprietor, is Baron Mackenzie of Kintail. KINTESAK, in the Shire of Nairn ; and in the Parish of Dyke. It is 3 m. W. b. N. from Forres. See, Dyke. KINTORE, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, with part ofthe Parish of Kinkell annexed : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was nearly 10 chalders of victual, one-third whereof is bear, and \u00a311..13..0. in money: the manse was built in 1784 : the glebe consists of about 9 acres : Patron, The Earl of Kintore, who is also chief Heritor ofthe Parish: The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resi dent Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 846, and, in 1811, was 876. It is 133! m- N. b. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. This is a Royal Borough of great antiquity, but none of its records are extant, of a later date than a Charter of confirmation by James the Fifth. It is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and 8 Counsellors. As the Set of the Burgh does not oblige them to change the Office bearers, The Earls of Kintore have accordingly been Provosts for upwards of a century. The bounds ofthe freedom ofthe Burgh are pretty large, particularly towards the East, where they extend above two miles. The Revenue is said to have been once considerable, but is now much diminished. The Town is small, but is tolerably built, and has a neat Town-House, and Prison. Kintore is one ofthe Contriljutary Royal Boroughs with Elgin, in sending one Member to Par liament. This Parish (including the annexed lands of Creechy, and Thainstown, which formerly constituted part of the Parish of Kinkell) contains upwards of Dd2"], [218, "K I P 7000 acres, besides a large Common. The haugh grounds along the banks of the river Don, are rich and fertile, but subject to inundations : towards the West, the soil gradually becomes worse, and covered with heath. Peats are the common fuel ; but the mosses are almost exhausted. The Salary of the Paro chial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. The roads are good. Here are very extensive Plantations by The Earl of Kintore, but there are no remains ofthe ancient Forest. Kintore gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble family of Falconer, to whose ancestor, Robert de Keith, Great Marischal of Scotland, a great part of the Parish, with the old Castle of Hall Forest, were given by King Robert Bruce, after the battle of Bannockburn. There are numerous cairns, and tumuli, which are said to point out the place where King Robert Bruce overtook and destroyed the army of Edward the First, after the defeat of Cumyn, Earl of Buchan, near Inverury, Thainstotcn, the residence of Duncan Forbes Mitchell, Esq., is surrounded with considerable plantations : this estate is said to have belonged for some time to the Thanes ofthe county ; but while in possession ofthe family of Forbes, previous to its becoming the property ofthe Mitchells, it was called Cammiestane, which is still the name of a Farm upon the estate.

A General Post-Office is established here. The Fairs are holden on the first Wednesday in January, the second Wednesday in April, the 26th of May, and the 23d of October. Besides which, there is a weekly Market in Kippen, on each Wednesday, for three or four Weeks, in the month of December. By an Act of Parliament of Scotland, of the 15th of June 1686, William Leckie, then proprietor of the Barony of Dasher or Deshoar, and his successors, are authorised to keep three Fairs in the year, at certain specified times, each to continue three days ; and also a weekly Market every Wednesday, to be holden on the Castle Hill of Dasher, upon which Part ofthe village of Kippen now stands : two of these Fairs still remain : that which was appointed to be holden in the month of September, has been long disused, as also the weekly Market, if indeed it was ever observed at all : the weekly Markets in December are probably all that remain of it; but a fresh attempt to establish a weekly corn Market at Kippen was made in 1795, and which it is believed, if properly established, will prove very beneficial to the country. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth. The soil is divided into carse, and dry field; the former lying on the banks ofthe Forth, in terspersed with extensive mosses ; the latter, occupying the higher grounds. The surface of the country exhibits a rich and extensive Prospect : at the head of the Strath, stands the House of Gartmore, the seat of Robert Graham, Esq., who is the principal Heritor; and a few miles below, the House and policy of Cardross, the seat of James Erskine, Esq., which greatly enliven the Landscape. In Moss Logan, a Roman road was lately discovered; and, in 1768, a Roman Camp kettle was found in the lands of Ochtertyre, which was presented to The Society of Antiquaries in Edinburgh: from whence it is conjectured, that the ancient Forest in this part of the Country was cut down by the Romans, and probably in the expedition of Severus, in the year 207. Peats are the common fuel. Of the Castles of Arnfindlay, and Garden, no vestiges now remain ; but the remains of the Castles of Arn prior, and Broich, may still be traced. On the summits of several small hills, are the marks of some ancient military works, called Keir (or, Caer,) \u00abnd which are ascribed to the Picts. The climate is wet, but not unhealthy. The rents are generally paid, partly in money, and partly in victual : and most of the Landlords exact various services: but thirlage is for the most part abolish ed, being only retained in a few instances. The great Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. A quantity of waste and barren land in Glen Tirran Moor, has"], [220, "K I R within these few years been divided into small lots, and feued off, and thus ren dered productive : and a part of the same Moor has lately been cultivated by General Campbell, whose extensive improvements on the estate of Boquhanare highly beneficial, and ornamental to the country. There are two established Schools ; one of them at Kippen, with a Salary of 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and an indifferent house ; the other at Claymires, with a Salary of \u00a340. Scotch, and a School-house and dwelling, which were erected in 1782. A School is also kept at the Burn of Arnprior. In 1745, the Rebel army passed the Forth by the ford of Freiv, on their way to Stirling ; when the Inhabitants were obliged to furnish them with provisions, but their march was not marked by any other act of violence : in 1783, a good Bridge was built at Frew. In the Perthshire part ofthe Parish, is an extensive Malt distillery.

It is in the Presbytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 3248, and, in 1811, was 3747. It is 12 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Mar ket, which is well supplied, is holden on Saturday ; and has this peculiarity, that it begins between three and four o'Clock in the morning, and is generally over by six. The Fairs, which were holden on the third Wednesday in July, and the last Wednesday in September, are now discontinued. A General Post- Office is established here. The Town is pleasantly situate on the Northern coast ofthe Firth of Forth, and is a well frequented Sea-bathing place. It is not known at what particular period it became of any considerable size, nor are there any traces of its history prior to the year 1334, when it was given to the Abbots of Dunfermlin, as a Bhrgh of Regality : it continued in their possession until the year 1450, when the Commendator and Convent disponed to the Baillies of"], [221, "K I R Kirkaldy, and their Successors for ever, the Burgh and Harbour, with all the cus toms, immunities, and privileges. It was soon after created a Royal Borough, and its privileges were especially ratified by a Charter of confirmation granted by Charles the First, in 1644; and the Burgh, \"for good and gratuitous service donebyit,\"wa& erected, de novo, into a free Royal Borough and free-Port, with new and larger immunities. At this time, it is said to have been more populous than it is at present, and to have had an hundredsail of ships belongingto the Port : but the Civil War breaking out, in which the Town of Kirkaldy took an active share on the part of the Parliament, it suffered so severely, and from subsequent events, that it was not until the year 1763, that its commerce begun to revive. Kirkaldy is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Kinghorn, in sending one Mem ber to Parliament. It is governed by a Provost, 2 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, and Treasurer, with a Council of 21 Members. The Revenues of the Burgh amount to about \u00a3300. Sterling per annum. The Harbour is narrow, and in commodious, and much exposed to a heavy sea from the Eastward, but about 10 or 12 years ago, a commodious bason was built which contains from 15 to 20 square rigged vessels, and where they usually lie up in winter. The duties pay able on exports and imports in all the towns on the North side of the Firth of Forth, from Aber-Dour to Largs inclusive, are under the Jurisdiction of the Custom-house at this Port ; the business of which is conducted by a Collector, with principal and junior Clerks, a Comptroller, a Land- Surveyor, 3 Land waiters, and 14 Tidesmen. This office has also the management of the Salt Duties within the same district ; the collection of which employs a Supervisor, 7 officers, and 20 watchmen. The principal manufacture is that of linen : be sides which, manufactures of leather, cotton, stockings, and salt, are carried on to a considerable extent. In 1785, a Branch of the Bank of Scotland was estab lished here. The Public School is under the care of two Masters, who teach in separate rooms, and without any dependence on each other: the Salary of the first, for grammar and arithmetic, is \u00a320., which, together with School-fees and perquisites, amount to \u00a3100. per annum: the Salary of the second Master, for English and writing, is \u00a316., which, with School-fees, amount also to about \u00a3100. : the stated Salaries of both the Masters are paid by The Town Council. The Parish of Kirkaldy contains about 870 Scotch acres. The surface rises gra dually from the coast to the Northern extremity ; the soil is mostly a fine black loam ; and it is ornamented with the beautiful Mansion and extensive plantations of Dunikier, the Seat of Mr. Oswald. The air, though often moist and cold,"], [222, "K I R especially when the wind is from the East, is not unhealthy. The Parish con tains free-stone, iron-stone, and coal ; the last of which is now wrought to a great extent by Mr. Oswald. The Public road is in good repair. Kirkaldy has produced many eminent men ; among whom must be enumerated Michael Scot, the Friar Bacon of Scotland, who flourished in the Thirteenth Century ; and, in the Eighteenth Century, it gave birth to Dr. John Drysdale, the well-known author of one volume of sermons (Posthumous;) \u2014 The distinguished Statesman and Patriot, the late Mr. Oswald, of Dunikier ; \u2014 and to that eminent benefactor to Society, Adam Smith, LL. D., the enlightened Author of the \" Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,\" who here spent most ofthe time that he has employed in writing that incomparable Book. Several elegant and extensive Villas have also been built in the vicinity of the Burgh, particu larly that of Walter Fergus, Esq. The Street of the Burgh being very narrow and dangerous for passengers in dark nights, the inhabitants have applied for and obtained a police Act for widening, lighting, and repairing it. Accord ing to Mr. Chalmers, there appears to have been an establishment of the Cul dees here ; whence the place was named Kill-Celedei, which was changed dur ing the Scoto-Saxon period to Kirk-Caledie. KIRK ANDREAS, in The Isle of Man. This is a Rectory, and Archdea conry.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Dum fries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Kirkbean, Preston, and Salterness) was 696, and, in 1811, was 800. It is 12 m. S. from Dumfries. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the coast ofthe Solway Firth. From the West to the North there is a ridge of Hills, that terminates in the Crow-Fell Mountain, a considerable part of which is within this Parish, and is elevated about 1900 feet above the level ofthe sea: in the border laws, corrected and improved by William Earl of Douglas, the last Warden ofthe West Marches, in 1440, this Mountain is mentioned as one of the Beacons for alarming the country, during the frequent incursions made by the English into Scotland : from this ridge of hills, the surface inclines towards the shore, and presents a rich, beautiful, and extensive prospect, of fields well inclosed, and in a high state of cultivation, surrounded and sheltered with clumps and belts of planting. To the superior knowledge, and unwearied attention of William Craik, Esq., of Arbigland, the great improvements in agriculture here are much indebted. The climate is healthy. Carsethorn Bay, on the East shore, and at the entrance of the river Nith, affords safe anchorage, in three fathoms water: here several palls of wood, for vessels to make fast to, have been driven into the beach by the Magistrates of Dum fries, who levy a sum for tonnage, on all vesselsthat discharge their cargoes upon this shore. The tides flow 5 hours, and ebb 7 : it is high water on the full and change ofthe Moon, at half past Eleven o'Clock. Many sand banks lie off this coast, and such is the rapidity ofthe tides, that vessels getting aground upon them, are sometimes upset and wrecked. It is the general opinion ofthe Inhabitants, that the Firth is gradually shutting up ; as they find by experience, that the navigation of it is daily becoming more difficult. Several kinds of fish abound upon the coast. The Parochial School funds amount to \u00a31008.. 4.. 0. : the interest of which supports two separate free schools ; one of them being under the direction ofthe Heritors and Minister, and possessing \u00a3608..4..0. ; and the other, \u00a3400., being a most benevolent donation ofthe late Mr. Andrew Marshall, Merchant in Glasgow.

KIRKBOST, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of North Uist, being situate to the Southward. It is one mile long, but very narrow ; the soil is sandy ; it lies quite exposed to the Western Ocean, wThich makes encroachments annually upon it, and is in danger of being blown away by the violent winds. KIRK BRADDAN, in The Isle of Man. It is situate about a mile and a half West-South-West from Douglas, and is the Parish Church of that Town. It stands in a very pleasant Valley, surrounded by trees ; and its Resident Popu lation, in 1792, was 1121. At the upper end ofthe Church-yard is a lofty, plain monument erected to the memory of Lord Henry Murray, brother to The Duke of Athol. Besides The Nunnery, there are several Houses delightfully situate in the neighbourhood of Douglas. Of these, Athol-Lodge, belonging to Lord Henry Murray, \u2014 Ballaughton, to the generous Captain Southcote, \u2014 \u25a0 and The Hague, the Seat of the late Richard Betham, LL. D., are the most considerable. KIRK BRIDE, in The Isle of Man. This is a Rectory, but it rhas no Par sonage-house. The Church is dedicated to St. Bridget; in the Church-yard is a stone Cross, with a Runic inscription upon it. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1792, was 678. At the Point of Ayre, the Northern extremity of the Island, the land lies very low ; and the shallowness ofthe water for a con siderable distance, has been the cause of numerous shipwrecks. It is 5 m. N. N. W. from Ramsay. KIRK-BUDDO, in the Shire of Forfar; and in the Parish of Guthrie : The Chapel is demolished. It is situate on the Northern bank of a rivulet to which it gives name, at the distance of about 6 m. S. S. E. from Forfar. This is the Southern part ofthe Parish of Guthrie, being 6 miles distant fram the Northern part ; and from which it is divided by the intervening part of four other Parishes : it contains about 1107 acres of various soil: most ofthe low, wet grounds have been drained and otherwise judiciously improved by the Proprietor, Colonel Erskine. Here is part of a Roman Camp, called Hare Faulds, the remainder"], [225, "K I R being situate in the Parish of Inverarity : the vallum, tmdfosse, are very distinct, and are still of a considerable height, and depth ; this is supposed by General Roy, who has preserved a plan of it, pi. 14., to have been one of the smaller temporary Camps occupied by Agricola on his return Westward, after his victory over the Caledonians under Galgacus, their Chief. On the 10th of November 1808, Charles Buchan, Esq., ofthe General Post-Office, Edin burgh, exhibited to The Society of Antiquaries of London, a small Urn which was discovered in a tumulus of loose sand, about 200 yards to the South ofthe Camp, near a Spring, which is the source of one of the streams that fall into the Isla. The Camp itself, according to the Archaeologi a, vol.

It is said to take its name from the Church being built on the side of a rushy bog. The Resident Popula tion of this Parish, in 1792, was 1590. It is3^m. W. from Castle-Town. Near this, are two very lofty square Pillars, placed at a considerable distance from each other, called The Giants Quoiting Stones, concerning which the neigh bouring Cottagers have a very chimerical tradition. And, at a little distance, is Fairy Hill, a noble tumulus or barrow, which was most probably raised by the Danes over the ashes of many of their countrymen, who were here slain in battle : but tradition says, that it was intended to perpetuate the remembrance ofthe death of Reginald, King of Man, who was killed in single combat on this spot by Ivar. This romantic Hill, in the opinion ofthe credulous natives, is still the scene of many a nocturnal revel :\u2014 - Ee2"], [226, "K I R \" What time, all in the Moon's pale beam, Dancing by mountain, wood, or stream, To magic melody, the Fays In green and gold and diamonds blaze.\" KIRK-COLM, in the District of The Rhyns, and Shire of Wigtown: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 4 bolls ofbear, 12 bolls of meal, Wigtown measure, and \u00a353. in money : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe consists of about 9 acres : Patron, The Earl of Galloway, who is also Titular ofthe Teinds, and by far the most considerable Proprietor ofthe Parish : The Church is dedicated to St. Columbus. It is in the Presbytery of Stranraer, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1191, and, in 1811, was 1465. It is 6 m. N. b. W. from Stranraer. This Parish is a sort of Peninsula, being bounded by the Atlantic on the West, Loch Ryan on the East, and the Parish of Leswalt on the South : it is about 6 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, with a level surface, which is almost entirely under tillage : the soil in the interior is a rich fertile loam, but round the shores it is thin, sandy, and gravelly. On the West coast of Loch Ryan, partly formed by the shores of Kirk-Colm, is a beautiful Bason, called The Wig, which is large enough to afford a safe retreat for a great number of small vessels in bad weather ; and, in other parts of the Bay of Loch Ryan, there is a sufficient depth of water for ships of any burden, and either good anchoring grounds, or a soft beach, as maybe most convenient; there are neither shoals nor sunken rocks near the mouth, to obstruct the entrance. Beyond a small point of land, called Tlie Scar, is a fine bank of excellent Oysters. The climate is mild and temperate, and the air salubrious. Great quantities of lime are imported as manure from Whitehaven, and Loch Lame in the North of Ireland : shells, and a soft sea sand, are also much used for that purpose. At the North-West extre mity ofthe Parish, are the ruins ofthe ancient and spacious Castle of Corshill, which gives name to the adjacent Promontory. This Castle was the Seat ofthe family of Cuningham. The last person who dwelt in it was Su-David Cuningham, thence denominated of Corshill: his descendant is now Lord Lisle. KIRK CONCH AN, v. ONCAN.

It is in the"], [227, "K I R Presbytery of Penpont, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1096, and, in 1811, was 1017. It is 5 m. W. N. W.from Sanquhar. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday in May. and the first Tuesday in November. This Parish is from 10 to 14 miles in length, and about 8 miles in breadth. It is intersected by the river Nith, from the banks of which the surface rises into lofty mountains, and irregular hills, covered with heath and grass, and interspersed with narrow vallies : the soil is, in general, cold, marshy, and deep. The air is moist and raw, but not unhealthy. Coals, and Peat, are abundant. Here are two mineral springs, one of them on the summit of the Rig-Hill, and the other at the Rig-Burn, both of which have been used with efficacy in stomachic and scorbutic complaints. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, besides School-fees, together with a gratuity of one pound Sterling from The Marquis of Queensberry ; and 10s., for which the Master is to teach a poor orphan or two, when any happen to be in the Parish, in consequence of a mortification to that effect, by The Rev. Mr. Hunter, a late Minister here. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The Marquis of Queensberry is Proprietor of nearly the whole Parish. It is supposed, that the surname of Kirkconnel originates from the name of this Parish ; and that the Chief of that family was, in ancient times, Proprietor ofthe whole or greatest part of it. This supposition is not a little confirmed by the consideration, that there are lands, in different Parishes of this Shire and its vicinity, named Kirkconnel, doubtless from the same Family. Ofthe lands thus named, the most considerable is, the Estate of Kirkconnel, in the Parish of Troqueer, and Stewartry of Galloway : the proprietor of this estate was formerly Kirkconnel, of that Ilk ; but afterwards, the very respectable and amiable Family of Maxwell, of Kirkconnel, in conse quence of a marriage, between the Heiress and a Gentleman who was a branch of the Nithsdale Family. KIRK-CONNEL, in the Shire of Dumfries : an ancient Parish, now com prehended in the Parish of Kirk- Patrick Fleeming : The Burying-ground is situate on a beautiful and romantic spot, on the winding banks of the river Kirtle. Here is abundance of free-stone of a grey colour, porous, but hard and durable. On the farm of Branteth, is a highly celebrated spring, of a strong sulphureous quality, distinguished by the name of The Branteth Well : and on High-Moor, and the Farm ofGouk-hall (which is known by the name of Charley's WeU) are two Chalybeate Springs, which are said to possess all the power and medicinal virtues ofthe famous Hartw ell Spate, near Moffat. The Mansion-House"], [228, "K I R of Springkell, which was erected in 1734, near the place where the old Man sion-House and Town of Kirk-Connel formerly stood, is the elegant residence of Sir William Maxwell, Bart. \u2014 In the Burial-ground of Kirk-Connel, are still to be seen theTombstones of Fair Helen, and her favourite lover Adam Fleeming. She was, it is said, a daughter ofthe Family of Kirk-Con nel, and fell a victim to the jealousy of a suitor. Being courted by two young Gentlemen at the same time, the one of whom thinking himself slighted, vowed to sacrifice the other to his resentment, whenever he discovered him in her company. An opportunity soon presented itself, when the faithful pair, walking along the romantic banks ofthe Kirtle, were discovered from the opposite banks by the Assassin. Helen perceiving him lurking among the bushes, and dreading the fatal resolution, rushed to her lover's bosom, to save him from the danger ; and thus receiving the wound intended for her beloved, sunk and expired in her favourite's arms. He instantly revenged her death, and slew the murderer. The inconsolable Adam Fleeming, now sinking under the pressure of grief, went abroad and served under the banners of Spain, against the Infidels. The impression, how ever, was too strong to be obliterated. The image of woe attended him thither ; and the pleasing remembrance of the tender scenes that were past, with the melancholy reflection, that they could never return, harassed his soul, and deprived his mind of repose. He soon returned, and stretching himself on her grave, expired, and was buried by her side. Upon the Tomb-stone are engraven a Sword and Cross, with \" Hie jacet Adam Fleeming.\" The memory of this is only preserved in an old Scotch Ballad, which relates the Tragical event, and which is said to have been written by Adam Fleeming, when in Spain. As this pathetic Song is little known, and affords a pretty good specimen of the vulgar dialect spoken at present in this country, which must have undergone little varia tion for upwards of 200 years, it is very judiciously inserted in the 13th volume of The Statistical Account, p. 275. This circumstance is said to have happened either in the latter end of the reign of James the Fifth, or the begin ning of that of Mary. \u2014 Excepting a Glen near Springkell, most of this District is very naked. It is said to have been cleared of the woods by Act of Parliament, in the reign of James the Sixth, in order to destroy the retreat of the Moss troopers, a pest which this part of the country was infamous for ; in fact the whole ofthe Borders then was, as Lindesay expresses, \" no other thing but theft, reiff and slaughter.\" \u2014 See, Kirk-Patrick Fleeming.

It is 98| m. S. b. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well sup plied. The Fair is holden on the 6th of September. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the Eastern bank of the river Dee, about five miles above its confluence with the Sol way Firth. Kirkcudbright, the head Burgh ofthe Stewartry, where the Courts of Justice and Public Records are kept, was anciently a Burgh of Regality, and holden of the Douglases, Lords of Galloway, as Superiors. Upon the forfeiture of the estates of James, the Ninth Earl of Douglas, and the last Lord of Galloway, at Edinburgh, on the 4th of August 1455, King James the Second erected the Town into a Royal Burgh by a Charter, dated at Perth, the 26th of October 1455 ; which was re newed and confirmed by a novodamus from King Charles the First, dated at Holyrood House, the 20th of July 1633. By this Charter, and the Sett of the Burgh, the Town Council is unalterably fixed to consist of 17 persons, viz., a Provost, 3 Baillies, a Treasurer, and 13 Counsellors, who are to meet annually at Michaelmas, and vote out three of their number, and elect three new Coun sellors in their place ; but this regulation has never been duly attended to. Kirk cudbright, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Annan, Dumfries, Loch maben, and Sanquhar, sends one Member to Parliament. The revenues of the Burgh arise chiefly from the rents of its landed property, and fisheries. By Act of Parliament it is expressly stated, that the Steward's Courts are to be holden in the Burgh, and no where else : this Court consists of a Steward Depute, who is the Supreme Judge, a Steward Clerk, and 7 Solicitors or Procurators: and"], [230, "K I R consent of Parliament, the Castle and Castle-Mains to the Town : at this time, it was not under the Jurisdiction ofthe Burgh ; but, since the King's grant, it has been alienated by the Corporation, though the land still continues subject to a Burgage tenure. The present Castle of Kirkcudbright is situate in a different part of the Town from Castle-Mains: it stands higher up tbe river, and was built, in the year 1582, by Thomas Maclellan, of Bombie, ancestor to thepre sent Lord Kirkcudbright : it is a strong, massy building, ofthe Gothic order; and is mostly entire, except the roof, which was stripped off and sold by the late Sir Thomas Maxwell, of Orchardton, to whom it had come by succession, and who afterwards sold it to The Earl of Selkirk. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. Besides the Castle of Kirkcudbright, there was another much more ancient within this Parish, which belonged to the family of Maclellan, called Raeberry Castle: it hung over a dreadful precipice above the Solway Firth, but at present nothing remains except the fosse. This Castle was besieged, and taken, by William, Earl of Douglas, and Lord of Galloway, in 1452. Sir Patrick Maclellan, of Bombie, the proprietor, having incurred the displeasure of this proud and lawless Baron, partly from his connection with Lord Herries (who had withdrawn his dependence upon the Earl, and was hanged), and partly from his attachment to his Sovereign, was seized in his own Castle, car ried to the Castle of Thrieve, condemned, and disgracefully put to death. This Family had another Castle at Bombie, within this Parish, from whence they took their title, and which is now a heap of ruins. In tracing the various re mains of old Castles, continues The Rev. Robert Muter, D. D., which for merly belonged to this powerful Clan, together with their vast possessions in land, one cannot help reflecting on the great instability of human affairs, and the sad train of misfortunes, which sometimes attend particular families more than others : of all the great estates that once belonged to this powerful and respect able family, there does not now remain a single foot of land to the heir male of the Title, the present Lord Kirkcudbright. In Spottiswood's Account of Re ligious Houses in Scotland, notice is taken of the Franciscans or Grey Friars, having been established here in the Twelfth Century. Brother John Carpenter, who is said to have been an excellent engineer, and dextrous in contriving all instruments of war, was one of the persons professed in this House : But there are no records here, that can throw any light on the history of this Order, whilst they continued at this place : the ancient records of this country, especially what belonged to the Church, having been carried off at the Reformation, by the"], [231, "K I R Popish Clergy, and lodged either in the Vatican at Rome, or in the Scotch Col lege at Paris : the present Church, however, seems to have been built on the same spot of ground, which was formerly occupied by the Fratres Minores, or Grey Friars. \u2014 St. Mary's Isle, now the beautiful Seat of The Earl of Selkirk, was formerly a Priory, which was founded in the reign of David the First, by Fergus, Lord of Galloway: it was called Prioratus Sanct\u00e6 Mariee de Trayll, and held of the Abbey of Holyrood-House ; The Prior was a. Lord of Parliament; there are now no vestiges of its original character. It is worthy of notice, that although the retreat of the sea is observable along the whole coast, yet it is more particularly remarkable around St. Mary's Isle. The sea, in former times, had flowed, not only round the whole Isle, but had also covered at least one half of all that is now verdant, at every flux ofthe tide. The former line of high water can be traced with great accuracy, by the large shell banks, that have lately been discovered all along the East side of the Peninsula : the West side is high ground, defended by a border of rocks, which constitute a bar, nearly across the Harbour. At ordinary Spring tides the depth of water here is about 20 feet ; and vessels may either pass over, or run channel-course close in with the rocks on the South shore, according to the wind and time of the tide. After passing the bar, the channel becomes narrow ; and it is necessary that large vessels should have a leading wind to carry them up the river Dee. Upon the shore, close by the Town, there is a fine shelving beach, where the shipping lie, or ride at anchor in the channel : here the depth is 8 feet at low water, and 28 at high water. The rise being about 20 feet, the river is navigable to Tongueland, two miles above the Town : where there is sufficient water for vessels of 200 tons burden, though it is but seldom that any, except coasting sloops, ascend so high, The distance from the entrance into the Harbour at the Solway Firth, up to the town of Kirkcudbright, is five miles ; and the widest part, at the point of St. Mary's Isle, is a mile and three quarters. The late Dr. Maxwell Garthshore, an eminent accoucheur, in London, was born at Kirkcudbright on the 28lh of October 1732. KIRKCUDBRIGHT, STEWARTRY. This Stewartry comprehends the Eastern district of Galloway, and contains 440,081 Scottish acres. It is rugged and mountainous, and is principally appropriated to the pasturage of black cattle, and sheep. The Resident Population of this Stewartry, in 1801, was 29,211, and, in 1811, was 33,684.

In 1783, a Society was established by a few bene volent persons, under the designation of The United Society of Kirkcud bright : the sole object of which is, to relieve the distressed, by preventing their want of subsistence while in sickness, and, in case of death, to defray the ex penses of their funerals : it extends also to the relief of the widows and orphans of deceased members : and, in aid of such laudable purposes, the number of con tributors is increased, and the happy effects of the Institution are daily experi enced.

Here is an excellent Subscription Library. About a quarter of a mile from the Borough, there is an old Church-yard, which, from time immemorial, has served the purpose of a burying-ground to the Town, and a part ofthe Parish annexed to it : in former times, a large Church was built in the middle of this field, but it is now so completely demolished, that there is not the smallest vestige of it to be seen : this Church was dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and the Church-yard is called at this day St. Cuthbert s Church-yard: the contiguity of this burying ground to the Town, together with the different ways of spelling Kirkcudbright, in old authentic writings, lead on to the supposition, that whatever might have been its ancient designation, its present name is derived from St. Cuthbert, in honour of the Tutelary Saint of this Place. \u2014 The Parish of Kirkcudbright is"], [233, "K I R about 7 miles in length, and from 3 to 4 miles in breadth, and contains 12,325 Scotch acres. The surface is mostly hilly, and has but little extended plain ; the hills, how7ever, are of small elevation, and are either arable, or afford excel- lent pasture, to their summits. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. Here are inexhaustible stores of sea-shells, which are beneficially used for enriching the contiguous grounds. The Earl of Selkirk possesses above five-sixths of the whole property, and has planted several hundred acres, with various kinds of Forest trees. The Dee (called by the Romans Deva, as the Town itself was styled by them Benutium, according to Baxter) abounds with fish : and many vestiges of British, and Roman Camps are still visible, in the neighbourhood. In the farm of Loch Fergus, is a large artificial Lake, with two small Islands, on both of which are evident marks of ancient fortifications, and which were un- questionably the seats or castles ofthe ancient Lords of Galloway. In the farm of Torrs, there are vestiges of a strong battery, erected by King William the Third, when his fleet was wind-bound in this Bay, on his voyage to raise the siege of London-Derry. Adjoining to the Burgh, is the vestige of an old fortification, called in ancient writings Castle-Mains, now Castle-Dykes: this Castle be- longed originally to the Lords of Galloway, whilst Galloway continued a sepa- rate Province from Scotland, and seems to have been built for the purpose of pro- tecting the entrance into the harbour. John Baliol having married Dornagilla, the eldest daughter, and one of the Co-heiresses of Alan, the last Lord of Galloway, succeeded to a considerable share of the property of her father, and also to this Castle. When the contest between the descendants of Baliol and Robert Bruce, for the Crown of Scotland, terminated in favour of the latter, the property of Baliol in Galloway was forfeited, and bestowed by the king upon Archibald Douglas, brother to James, Lord of Douglas, for his eminent ser- vices in driving Edward Baliol out of the Kingdom. This Castle remained in the hands ofthe Douglases, Lords of Galloway, 'till the year 1455, when their vast possessions in this country were forfeited, and annexed to the Crown. James the Fourth gave a grant of this Castle, and some lands belonging to it, to the Burgh of Kirkcudbright, by a Charter, dated at Edinburgh, the 26th of February 1509. It appears by another Charter, dated at Kirkcudbright in 1508, that the King had been here in person ; and the tradition is, that His Majesty had been hospitably entertained by the Burgh, and that they claimed some reward for their former services to James the Second, when he was besieging the Castle of Tlirieve, and for recent services to himself; Wherefore His Majesty granted, with VOL. ii.

Within the Burgh are, a Rector of the Grammar School, a teacher of writing and arithmetic, and a teacher of English : the Rector enjoys a Salary of \u00a330. per annum, the other two masters have \u00a330. between them : the Scholars, and Boarders, are numerous, and the greatest praise is due to the respective Masters for their unwearied attention to the morals and education of their pupils. Here is an excellent Subscription Library. About a quarter of a mile from the Borough, there is an old Church-yard, which, from time immemorial, has served the purpose of a burying-ground to the Town, and a part ofthe Parish annexed to it : in former times, a large Church was built in the middle of this field, but it is now so completely demolished, that there is not the smallest vestige of it to be seen : this Church was dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and the Church-yard is called at this day St. Cuthbert s Church-yard: the contiguity of this burying ground to the Town, together with the different ways of spelling Kirkcudbright, in old authentic writings, lead on to the supposition, that whatever might have been its ancient designation, its present name is derived from St. Cuthbert, in honour of the Tutelary Saint of this Place. \u2014 The Parish of Kirkcudbright is"], [235, "K I R about 7 miles in length, and from 3 to 4 miles in breadth, and contains 12,325 Scotch acres. The surface is mostly hilly, and has but little extended plain ; the hills, however, are of small elevation, and are either arable, or afford excel- lent pasture, to their summits. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. Here are inexhaustible stores of sea-shells, which are beneficially used for enriching the contiguous grounds. The Earl of Selkirk possesses above five-sixths of the whole property, and has planted several hundred acres, with various kinds of Forest trees. The Dee (called by the Romans Deva, as the Town itself was styled by them Benutium, according to Baxter) abounds with fish : and many vestiges of British, and Roman Camps are still visible, in the neighbourhood. In the farm of Loch Fergus, is a large artificial Lake, with twro small Islands, on both of which are evident marks of ancient fortifications, and which were un- questionably the seats or castles ofthe ancient Lords of Galloway. In the farm of Torrs, there are vestiges of a strong battery, erected by King William the Third, when his fleet was wind-bound in this Bay, on his voyage to raise the siege of London-Derry. Adjoining to the Burgh, is the vestige of an old fortification, called in ancient writings Castle-Mains, now Castle-Dykes: this Castle be- longed originally to the Lords of Galloway, whilst Galloway continued a sepa- rate Province from Scotland, and seems to have been built for the purpose of pro- tecting the entrance into the harbour. John Baliol having married Dornagilla, the eldest daughter, and one of the Co-heiresses of Alan, the last Lord of Galloway, succeeded to a considerable share of the property of her father, and also to this Castle. When the contest between the descendants of Baliol and Robert Bruce, for the Crown of Scotland, terminated in favour of the latter, the property of Baliol in Galloway was forfeited, and bestowed by the king upon Archibald Douglas, brother to James, Lord of Douglas, for his eminent ser- vices in driving Edward Baliol out ofthe Kingdom. This Castle remained in the hands ofthe Douglases, Lords of Galloway, 'till the year 1455, when their vast possessions in this country were forfeited, and annexed to the Crown. James the Fourth gave a grant of this Castle, and some lands belonging to it, to the Burgh of Kirkcudbright, by a Charter, dated at Edinburgh, the 26th of February 1509. It appears by another Charter, dated at Kirkcudbright in 1508, that the King had been here in person ; and the tradition is, that His Majesty had been hospitably entertained by the Burgh, and that they claimed some reward for their former services to James the Second, when he was besieging the Castle of Tlirieve, and for recent services to himself; Wherefore His Majesty granted, with VOL. ii. F f"], [236, "K I R consent of Parliament, the Castle and Castle-Mains to the Town : at this time, it was not under the Jurisdiction ofthe Burgh ; but, since the King's grant, it has been alienated by the Corporation, though the land still continues subject to a Burgage tenure. The present Castle of Kirkcudbright is situate in a different part of the Town from Castle-Mains: it stands higher up the river, and was built, in the year 1582, by Thomas Maclellan, of Bombie, ancestor to thepre sent Lord Kirkcudbright : it is a strong, massy building, ofthe Gothic order; and is mostly entire, except the roof, which was stripped off and sold by the late Sir Thomas Maxwell, of Orchardton, to whom it had come by succession, and who afterwards sold it to The Earl of Selkirk. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. Besides the Castle of Kirkcudbright, there was another much more ancient within this Parish, which belonged to the family of Maclellan, called Raeberry Castle : it hung over a dreadful precipice above the Solway Firth, but at present nothing remains except the fosse. This Castle was besieged, and taken, by William, Earl of Douglas, and Lord of Galloway, in 1452. Sir Patrick Maclellan, of Bombie, the proprietor, having incurred the displeasure of this proud and lawless Baron, partly from his connection with Lord Herries (who had withdrawn his dependence upon the Earl, and was hanged), and partly from his attachment to his Sovereign, was seized in his own Castle, car ried to the Castle of Thrieve, condemned, and disgracefully put to death. This Family had another Castle at Bombie, within this Parish, from whence they took their title, and which is now a heap of ruins. In tracing the various re mains of old Castles, continues The Rev. Robert Muter, D. D., which for merly belonged to this powerful Clan, together with their vast possessions in land, one cannot help reflecting on the great instability of human affairs, and the sad train of misfortunes, which sometimes attend particular families more than others : of all the great estates that once belonged to this powerful and respect able family, there does not now remain a single foot of land to the heir male of the Title, the present Lord Kirkcudbright. In Spottisw^ood's Account of Re ligious Houses in Scotland, notice is taken of the Franciscans or Grey Friars, having been established here in the Twelfth Century. Brother John Carpenter, who is said to have been an excellent engineer, and dextrous in contriving all instruments of war, was one of the persons professed in this House: But there are no records here, that can throw any light on the history of this Order, whilst they continued at this place : the ancient records of this country, especially what belonged to the Church, having been carried off at the Reformation, by the"], [237, "K 1 R Popish Clergy, and lodged either in the Vatican at Rome, or in the Scotch Col lege at Paris : the present Church, however, seems to have been built on the same spot of ground, which was formerly occupied by the Fratres Minores, or Grey Friars. \u2014 St. Mary's Isle, now the beautiful Seat of The Earl of Selkirk, was formerly a Priory, which was founded in the reign of David the First, by Fergus, Lord of Galloway: it was called Prior atus Sanctce Marice de Trayll, and held of the Abbey of Holyrood-House ; The Prior was a Lord of Parliament; there are now no vestiges of its original character. It is worthy of notice, that although the retreat of the sea is observable along the whole coast, yet it is more particularly remarkable around St. Mary's Isle. The sea, in former times, had flowed, not only round the whole Isle, but had also covered at least one half of all that is now verdant, at every flux ofthe tide. The former line of high water can be traced with great accuracy, by the large shell banks, that have lately been discovered all along the East side of the Peninsula : the West side is high ground, defended by a border of rocks, which constitute a bar, nearly across the Harbour. At ordinary Spring tides the depth of water here is about 20 feet ; and vessels may either pass over, or run channel-course close in with the rocks on the South shore, according to the wind and time of the tide. After passing the bar, the channel becomes narrow ; and it is necessary that large vessels should have a leading wind to carry them up the river Dee. Upon the shore, close by the Town, there is a fine shelving beach, where the shipping lie, or ride at anchor in the channel : here the depth is 8 feet at low water, and 28 at high water. The rise being about 20 feet, the river is navigable to Tongueland, two miles above the Town : where there is sufficient water for vessels of 200 tons burden, though it is but seldom that any, except coasting sloops, ascend so high. The distance from the entrance into the Harbour at the Solway Firth, up to the town of Kirkcudbright, is five miles ; and the widest part, at the point of St. Mary's Isle, is a mile and three quarters. The late Dr. Maxwell Garthshore, an eminent accoucheur, in London, was born at Kirkcudbright on the 28th of October 1732. KIRKCUDBRIGHT, STEWARTRY. This Stewartry comprehends the Eastern district of Galloway, and contains 440,081 Scottish acres. It is rugged and mountainous, and is principally appropriated to the pasturage of black cattle, and sheep. The Resident Population of this Stewartry, in 1801, was 29,211, and, in 1811, was 33,684. It sends one Member to Parliament. KIRK-DALE, v. KIRK-MABRECK.

This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and from one to three miles in breadth, stretching along Loch Beauly ; and forming a plain of four miles in extent, from which the surface gradually rises to the hilly district: in the vallies, the soil is a rich clay loam, exceedingly fertile ; higher up, it becomes more thin and gravelly, but which, in good seasons, is tolerably productive. The climate is mild, and temperate. The Chalybeate Spring at Achnagairn, which was formerly much frequented, is now quite neglected. The river Beauly runs along the North-West boundary of the Parish, for about two or three miles, and is navigable at high water, by vessels of about 50 tons burden, so far as the Village of Beauly : it produces abundance of excellent salmon, and several kinds of trout. The Salary of the Parochial Schoolmaster is 300 merks Scotch, besides School-fees. The Society for propa gating Christian Knowledge have also established a School here, with a Salary of \u00a312. The language chiefly spoken here is Gaelic. The great disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the scarcity of fuel. Here are the remains of two Druidical temples, much defaced : and on the moor, between Achnagairn and the Ferry of Beauly, through which the Public road leads to the Northern Counties, are many small tumuli, which are said to point out the place of a des perate engagement between two rival Clans. A little above this Ferry, a bridge of considerable magnitude is erected, which will be of infinite service to the Northern Counties. KIRK-HOPE, v. ETTERICK. KIRK-HOPE, v. WAAS.

The appearance of the country is hilly, but no where mountainous ; the soil is, in general, thin and light, except the carse land of Balder n, which is. a deep ar,d rich clay. Agriculture is much attended to here. The air is pure, and healthy. Peat is the common fuel. There are the vestiges of two ancient camps, of a circular form ; and, on the Farm of Burness, some old coins have been discovered, which are now in the possession of The Earl of Selkirk. KIRKINTILLOCH, in the Shire of Dumbarton, though locally situate in the Shire of Lanark: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe : Patron, Lord Elphinstone : The Church is in decent order. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow arid Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 3210, and, in 1811, was 3740. It is 7 m. N. b. E. from Glasgow, and 40 m. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the banks ofthe Luggie, near its confluence with the river Kelvin. This Town is a very ancient Burgh of Barony ; it was erected about the year 1170, by William the Lion, King of Scotland, in favour of William Cumyn, Baron of Leinzie, and Lord of Cumbernauld ; and it still holds ofthe latter Barony, for the payment of 12 merks Scotch, of yearly feu-duty. Its privileges are very extensive, and its Burgesses elect their own Magistrates, independently ofthe Lord ofthe Barony. It is governed by two Baillies, who are chosen annually; and who are empowered by the Charters ofthe Burgh, to hold Courts, levy Fines, imprison Offenders, or even to exercise the punishment of Banishment, and every right with which the Baron himself was vested, before the erection of the Burgh. These rights the Community have ever since continued to enjoy without molestation ; and, on the abolition of Heritable Jurisdictions in 1748, they were in no degree affected by the Act. A large tract of land was annexed to this Burgh at its erection ; and is now feued out, from time to time, in small portions, as purchasers offer. The Weavers are the most numerous class of manufacturers here. A Fair is holden on the 20th of October. This Parish is about 5-j miles in length ; its breadth varies considerably : around the Town, the soil is a light black loam, on a reddish tilly bottom ; but a strong deep clay prevails through the Southern, and the Eastern parts of it. Lime-stone, coals, and free-stone, are found in great abundance."], [240, "K I R The grand Canal, between the Forth and Clyde, passes through the whole length ofthe Parish. The District, which now constitutes the Parish of Kirkin tilloch, made, in the time ofthe Romans, a part of the Northern boundary ofthe Province of Valentia: and when the country was afterwards divided into Parishes, it acquired the name of Wester Leinzie. Under that denomination, it was given by Robert the First of Scotland to Sir Robert de Fleming, in consideration of the eminent services he had performed, in the course of the long and bloody contest, which that Monarch carried on with the English, for the possession of the Scottish throne. The great Roman Wall, commonly called Graham's Dyke, passes through its whole extent ; the remains of which, and of three large Forts, and as many Watch-towers, may still be distinctly traced : and General Roy, in pi. 35, has given a plan of The Peel. In the beginning of the Fourteenth century, the whole Parish, except the Burgh lands of Kirkintilloch, and the small Barony of Wester Gartshore (which has, for many generations, been possessed by that ancient and respectable Family, the Gartshores, of Gartshore), were the entire property ofthe Noble Family of Fleming. But, in the long series of years/which have elapsed since that period, this great Estate has been gradually dismembered, and nothing now continues in the possession of the former Pro prietors, but the Feu-duties, and some other casualties of Feudal superiority. KIRKLAND, or KIRKLAND of METHIL, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife: in the Parish of Wemyss. It is If ra. W. b. S. from Leven. This is a neat, and improving Village, situate on the Southern bank of the river Leven ; and has entirely arisen from the establishment of a large Spinning Work, under the firm of Messrs.

A Penny-Post Office is established here. This Parish is about 5\\ miles in length, and about 3f miles in breadth on the average : the soil varies from a strong clay, to rich black mould ; the only exceptions being a few Haughs on the banks ofthe river, composed of a light loamy soil : the whole ofthe Parish is under tillage, and agriculture is in a high state of improvement. The Hamlet of Old-Liston, and about a fourth part ofthe Parish, lie on the South-East ofthe river Amon, in the Shire of Edinburgh. The Manor of Liston, according to Mr. Chalmers, was granted, during the Twelfth century, to the Knights of the Temple, from whom it acquired the name of Temple- Liston. Their Successors, the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, enjoyed this Manor till the Reformation, though not without dilapidations ; when Sir James Sandilands, the Chief of the Order of St. John, acquired their whole Estates, as a Temporal Lord ship. The Church, with the Village, the Mill, and much of the adjacent lands, called The Mains, or Demesne, and Kirk-lands of Kirk-Liston, were granted to the Bishop of St. Andrew's, though at what time is uncertain : but, Liston was formed into the'Seat of the Regal Jurisdiction, which the Bishop, and his Succes sors, acquired over their Estates on the Southern side ofthe Forth: The Hall, in which the Baillie of this Jurisdiction held his Courts, was standing about the year 1700. On the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, in 1748, The Earl of Hope toun claimed for the Regality of St. Andrew's, South ofthe Forth, \u00a31500. In 1543, the Familyof Dundas, of Craigton, obtained the estate of New Liston,whose descendants enjoyed it, till the Revolution ; when it was carried into the Noble Family of Dalrymple, by Elizabeth, the Daughter of Sir John Dundas, who married the second Viscount of Stair : in 1703, he was created Earl of Stair, and with other titles, Lord New- Liston. New-Liston, now a Seat of The Earl of Stair, is a most delightful place ; the pleasure grounds and policies, nearly three miles in circumference, were entirely laid down on the plan of the cele brated John Earl of Stair, Field Marshal, who retired to this estate, where he died in 1747, and was buried in Kirk-Liston Church, without a Memorial. The remarkable antique inscribed Monument, called The Cat-stane, is situate on the Farm of that name in this Parish : near which, according to Buchanan and vol. ii.

This Parish, which comprehends part of the ancient Parish of Kirk-Dale, is 8 miles in length, aud about 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the Eastern side of Wigtown Bay, and the river Cree. The surface has in general a mountainous appearance ; but the vallies are well adapted for culture, and by the industry of the inhabitants, and the vicinity of inexhaustible treasures of sea-shells, have been rendered very fertile, either for pasturage or tillage. The great Military road, from Carlisle to Port- Patrick, passes through the Parish, and presents the most beautiful and diversified scenery in the South of Scotland. Game, of all kinds, are abundant. The climate, though rainy, is particularly healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees : Besides which, there are several private Schools. Peats are the principal article of fuel, of which there are abundance of the best quality : coals are imported from England. This Parish is famous for an excellent granite, of which immense quantities are exported. Kirk-Dale House, the elegant Man- sion of Sir Samuel Hannay, Bart., of Mochdrum, is built of this stone. Barholm is the beautiful Seat of John Macculloch, Esq. The Church of Kirk-Mabreck, which formerly stood in a brake near the banks of the Bay, was removed many vears ago to Creetown, where it now stands ; but the inhabitants still continue to bury at the old Church. The most memorable place of antiquity is called Cairn Holy, or Tlie Holy Cairn, from a tumulus, which, according to tradition, was raised over the Bishop of Whitehorn, who was there slain in an engagement with the English, in 1150.

The general appearance is hilly; but a great part ofthe flat ground is arable, and produces excellent crops. The coast, particularly near The Point of Mull, the ancient Novantum Chersonesus, is bold and rocky : but, on each side, there are several safe anchoring places, especially at Mary Port, Drummore, Curgie, Kilstay, and Port Nessock.

The Forest of Glen-Builg, which is also the property of The Duke of Gordon, is about 5 miles in length, and between 2 and 3 miles in breadth. In many of the Grampian mountains are found those beautiful stones, called Cairn Gorm Stones. There are two Schools ; a Society one at the Vil lage of Tomintoul or Tammtoul, with a Salary of \u00a313..10..0. ; and a Parochial one at Tamch-Laggan, with the usual legal Salary. A superstitious regard is still paid to particular times and seasons by the inhabitants of this Parish. At Camdale, in the upper end of it, there was formerly a Chapel of Ease, which was dedicated to St. Bridget. See, Burgh-Head.

Sterling in money, 4 chalders of barley, and 4 chalders of oat-meal : the manse is very small, and improperly situate on swampy ground, below a brae : the glebe con sists of 25 acres of poor arable soil, and 6 acres of barren stony moor : Patron, Mrs. Urquhart, of Braclangivell and Newhall : The Church is neat, and com modious. It is in the Presbytery of Chanonry, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1792, was 1234, and, in 1811, was 1168. It is T\u00b1 m. N. N. W. from Fortrose. This Parish extends along the South side ofthe Firth of Cromarty, and is nearly 8 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The soil is various ; but is chiefly a light black loam, on a cold gravelly clay: and agriculture is quite in its infancy here. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is situate at the East end of the Parish, is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have also established a School, at the Western extremity, for spinning, knitting stockings, and reading English, with a Salary of \u00a37. Rich shell-marle, and free-stone, abound here. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. There are numerous ancient encampments : And, on the shore of Cullicudden, is a Building that has the appearance of great antiquity, called The Castle of Craighouse ; about 200 years ago, the Castle, with the lands adjoining, be longed to the Williamsons, of Craighouse : the Representative of which Family lately died a Count, in Germany. The Castle and Lands of Craighouse, after wards became the property, and occasional residence, ofthe Bishops of Ross, and are now a part of the Estate of Neivhall. There are seven Heritors ; of whom, Mrs. Urquhart, of Braclanguell and Newhall; and George Gun Monro, Esq., of Poynter field, are resident, and have added much to the beauty and value of their estates, by inclosures and extensive plantations. A small part of this Parish extends into the County of Ross. See, Cromarty, and Newhall. KIRK-MICHAEL, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parish of Garrel united: the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is a cold, uncomfortable dwelling : the glebe consists of about 14 acres, of high lying land, together with a garden : The Marquis of Queensberry is Patron ofthe old Parish of Kirk-Michael, by a Charter from the Crown ; but, as the Patronage of the old Parish of Garrel is not in that Charter, and as Garrel was a Mensal Church of the Archbishoprick of Glasgow, the Crown claims the right of being Vice-"], [247, "K I R Patron of the United Parishes : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Michael, has been considerably enlarged by a decrees of the Court of Session, and the Church-yard surrounded with a good stone and lime wall, and coped with free- stone. It is in the Presbytery of Lochmaben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthe United Parish, in 1801, was 904, and, in 1811, was 1035. It is 7 m. N. W. from Lochmaben. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth : the Upper or North-West part is hilly, and chiefly covered with heath, except only a few spots of arable ground on the sides of the river Ae, and the rivulet called Glenkill-Burn .- the Lower or South-East part is in general plain and very fertile, but interspersed with several rising grounds that are covered with heath, and some large peat mosses which supply the Inhabitants with fuel. Besides nearly 200 acres of natural Wood, there are some extensive Plantations : but the wood, called Knock- Wood, in the Barony of Ross, having been cut down some years ago, sufficient care was not after- wards taken to protect the young shoots from the sheep and cattle in the neigh- bourhood. Game, of various kinds, are abundant. The climate, though moist, is remarkably healthy. There are two Lochs ; one of which, of about two or three acres in extent, is apparently very deep, but without fish of any sort ; and in the other, which contains ten or twelve acres, are great numbers of pike, aud eels, though not so numerous as to serve the neighbouring inhabitants as an article of food. There are several indistinct remains of ancient fortifications ; but there are no traditionary accounts about any other than a small Fort in the Knock- Wood, called Wallace's House, said to \u25a0 have been thrown up by Sir William Wallace, aster he had slain Sir Hugh of Moreland, and five of his men, at a place still named, from that event, the Sax Corses, i. e. The Six Corpses; and where there are two or three large stones, which seem to have been set np in remembrance of some such transaction. A branch of the great Roman Road, that led from Netherby in Cumberland to the chain of Forts built by Lollius Urbicus, between the Forth and the Clyde, may still be traced through a mosss, and seems to have terminated at a Castellum, which is now the Minister's garden, and of which two sides still remain very distinct. Near this line of Road, in a small piece of peat moss, a pretty large pot, of a sort of base copper, and a vase of the same metal, both supposed to be Roman, were discovered a few years ago, and are now in the Museum of The Society of Antiquaries of Edinburgh. KIRK MICHAEL, in The Isle of Man : The Church is dedicated to The"], [248, "K I R Arch-Angel. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1792, was 1003. It is 8 m. N. N. E. from Peel. This Village is pleasantly situate near the Sea shore ; and almost contiguous to it, is the Village of Glen- William. Opposite the entrance ofthe Church-yard, is a lofty pillar of blue stone, figured over with Runic characters, and devices curiously involved with each other, from the base to the summit ; and which is supposed to have been erected in honour of Thu rulf, a Norwegian hero. Near the Eastern end of the Church, is the Tomb stone of Bishop Wilson : This venerable Prelate, aster a life of exemplary piety and benevolence, died on the 7th of March 1755, in the 93d year of his age, and in the 58th year of his Consecration : And the very modest inscription, prefixed by his Son, Dr. Wilson, late Dean of St. Paul's, concludes with, \" Let this Island speak the rest !\" KIRK-MICHAEL, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a355..11..1\u00a3, including \u00a38.. 6..8. for Communion elements, and \u00a3102.. 15.. 6^. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse is in good repair: the glebe consists of 4 acres of indifferent arable land, and a steep sand bank for pasture: Patron, James Farquharson, Esq., of Invercauld : The Church, which was built in 1792, is sufficiently large and commodious. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1568, and, in 1811, was 1460. It is \\2{ m. N. W. from Blair-Go wrie. The Market is on Friday. There are three annual Fairs holden within the Parish; one of them at Kirk -Michael, called The Michaelmas Market, and two at The Spital of Glen Shee. This Parish is 17 miles in length, and from 6 to 7 miles in breadth ; comprehending the greater part of Strath Ardle, the whole of Glen Shee, and a District lying at the lower extremity of that Glen, on the West side of the river, called Black-Water, which gives name to the country through which it flows. The soil on the banks of the Ardle, is thin and dry, yielding light crops ; in the higher grounds, it is wet and spongy, and un friendly to vegetation ; and indeed, the greater part of the Parish is more adapted to pasturage than to tillage. The climate is cold, but not unhealthy. The fuel generally used, is peat and turf. Lime-stone is plentiful. The great Military road, from Cupar of Angus to Fort George,' passes along the Black-Water, and through Glen Shee. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, and perquisites. Various old Customs are still preserved here. Some Services are exacted. There are several cairns, and Druidical circles. By a Letter"], [249, "K I R from His Grace The Duke ofATHOL to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, dated the 28lh of April 1809, it appears, that the Bridge at this place over the Ferry being now completed, \" I beg leave,\" continues His Grace, \" to submit to The Honourable Board, that the forming of two lines of road, under the direction ofthe Board, and upon the principle of a moiety of the expense being defrayed by individuals, would tend greatly to the improve ment ofthe Centre Highlands, and to the Public Utility as connected with the Bridge here. \u2014 The first line I have to submit to your consideration, begins at the Bridge of Kynachom (over the river Tumel), keeping on the South side of the Lake of that name, passing the river by a Bridge which might be made at a small expense near the foot of the Lake, and joining the Road at the present Bridge over the Garry, thereby forming a junction with the Military Road to Inverness, fifteen miles above Dunkeld. This line would open a tract of High land country, the Inhabitants of which are at present obliged to take a very cir cuitous route ; and this line, I conceive, might afterwards be protracted so as to open (along Loch Rannoch) the easiest communication with the West High lands. \u2014 The other line I have to submit, is meant to give a communication to Highland Glens, North of Dunkeld, by making a road from the village of Kirk- Michael in Strath Ardle to Dowally, which is five miles above Dunkeld ; at present no passable road (for a cart even) exists in this direction under a detour of more than double the distance, which, by a proper line, would not exceed ten miles.\" \u2014 In consequence of His Grace's request, The Commissioners directed Mr. Telford to examine this line, and it is reported to be very practicable ; but, for extensive utility, it ought to form a junction with the Braemar Road, a few miles South ofthe Spital of Glen Shee, whereby cattle coming from the Shire of Aberdeen, and even from the East coast ofthe Shire of Ross, and from Inverness, would turn down Strath Ardle, and travel by Dunkeld to Crieff through an open and grazing country, saving ten or twelve miles in distance, and the inconvenience of passing through an inclosed and populous District. These considerations have been submitted to His Grace The Duke of Athol, and this important ob ject may be expected to be soon completed. See, Moulin.

William Cameron, the Incumbent : Patrons, by turns, The Duke of Buccleugh, and The Earl of Morton, formerly the sepa rate Patrons of East Calder, and Kirk-Newton : A new Church was lately built for the United Parish, in a central situation ; to which was given the appropriate name of Kirk-Newton, to distinguish it from the neighbouring village of East Newton. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweed dale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1071, and, in 1811, was 1300. It is 2\u00a7* m. E. from Mid Calder. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth : it is bounded on the North by the river Amon, and, on the South, by the water of Leith. The surface towards the South is hilly ; but, towards the North and East, it becomes level and fertile ; great num bers of sheep are fed in the hills, and the low lands are mostly inclosed, and Avell cultivated. Here is plenty of lime, of excellent quality. The air is re markably pure, and healthy. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. Meadowbank is the beautiful seat of The Right Honourable Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, one of the Lords of Ses sion, and is surrounded by extensive Plantations. Ormiston-Hill was formerly the estate of the celebrated William Cullen, M. D. ; he died on the llth of October 1790, and is interred in the Church-yard here. KIRK-OSWALD, in the District of Carrick, and Shire of Ayr: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 43 bolls 1 firlot of meal, 20 bolls 3 firlots of bear, and \u00a355.. 5.. 2.

It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1679, and, in 1811, was 1689. It is 4 m. SW. b. W. from Maybole. This Parish contains about 11,000 Scotch acres, stretching along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean ; where the soil is a rich loam, with a mixture of clay, and abundantly fertile : the mountainous district being appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together"], [251, "K I R with School-fees and perquisites, and a School-house, and garden. The air is pure, and salubrious. All personal services are entirely abolished, except the leading of a stipulated quantity of coals. The great road, from Ayr to Port- Patrick, passes through the Village, where changes of Post-horses may be ob tained. Several Plantations have lately been made here, which are in a flourishing condition. Upon a small Promontory in the Barony of Turnberry, now the pro perty of The Earl of Cassillis, are the ruins ofthe famous Castle of Turnberry, the ancient seat ofthe Earls of Garrick. In 1274, Martha, Countess of Carrick, resided here, and was in that year married to Robert Bruce, Earl of Annan dale ; from whence sprung the Kings of Scotland, of the Stewart race. In 1306, it was holden by an English garrison, under Earl Percy ; but it was after wards stormed, and destroyed, by King Robert Bruce. The situation of this Castle is most delightful, having a full prospect ofthe whole Firth of Clyde: its ruins, as they now lie, cover an acre of ground. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. The Abbey of Cross Regal or Cross-Raguel is situate two miles East from the village, and was founded by Duncan Earl of Carrick, in 1244, for monks of the Cluniac Order. The last Abbot of this place was Quintin Kennedy, brother to The Earl of Cassillis : the famous George Buchanan had afterwards \u00a3500. Scotch paid to him yearly from this Abbey, which gave him occasion to denominate himself Pensionarius de Crosragmol: both the Temporalities and Spiritualities of this Abbey were annexed to the Bishoprick of Dumblane, in 1617, by James the Sixth. It is the most entire Abbey in the West of Scotland, and stands in the middle of 8 acres of ground, commonly called The Abbots Yard, or Precinct of Cross-Regal: it belongs to the Chapel Royal, and is let in tack to the family of Killkerran, who subset it to one of the tenants of the rich and extensive Barony of Baiter san, in the center of which it stands : this ruin is preserved with great care and attention, the tenants not being allowed on any account whatever, to take down and use any stone from the Abbey. Mr. Grose has preserved three views of it. About half a mile to the South-East of Cullean, is the House or Castle of Thomaston, which, according to tradition, was built by a nephew of Robert Bruce, in 1335: it has been exceedingly strong, and of very considerable extent : it is uninhabited, and is now the property of The Earl of Cassillis. Cullean Castle, the seat of The Earl of Cassillis, was built in 1777, after a plan of Mr. Robert Adam, Senior: this noble edifice is situate upon a perpendicular rock overlooking the sea, and commanding a most exten sive prospect : the policies contain about 700 acres, interspersed with flourishing Hh2"], [252, "K I R plantations, laid out with great taste and judgment. Near to the Castle, and immediately under some ofthe buildings, are the extensive Caves of Cullean. KIRK-OWEN, in the District of Machers, and Shire of Wigtown : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in decent repair: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent: Patron, Agncw, of Bambarrow : The Church is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Wigtown, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 787, and, in 1811, was 1006. It is 7^m. N.W. from Wig town. This Parish is about 15 miles in length, and from one to seven miles in breadth : the surface is partly moor-land, and partly arable ; but the soil is poor and thin, and is better adapted for pasturage than for culture. The Roads are in good repair. It is watered by the rivers Bladenoch, and Tars which unite in the Parish, and which abound w-ith fish. Game is in plenty here. KIRK PATRICK, in The Isle of Man : This Church was erected in 1710, and, with many others, is owing to the Religious zeal and exertions of the late Bishop Wilson. It is 2j m. S. from Peel. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1792, was 2153. Near this, is the beautiful and romantic valley of Glen-May. KIRK-PATRICK DURHAM, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : the manse and offices, are in good repair : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Dumfries. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 1007, and, in 1811, was 1156. It is 5~ m. N. from Castle-Douglas. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and from 3 to 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the Eastern bank ofthe river Urr. The Northern part of the Parish is, in a very large proportion, covered with heath ; \u2022being appropriated to the pasturage of black cattle and sheep, and abounding with game : the Southern part is inclosed, and almost entirely arable, but the soil is thin and sandy. Agriculture here is much indebted to the patriotic example and exertions of The Rev. Dr. Lamont : though this spirit is con siderably checked, and the progress of improvement very much retarded, by \" a severe servitude,\" laid on a great part of the Parish, in consequence of an astriction to the Mill of Loch Patrick : this, after a deduction of seed and horse corn, amounts to about the Twelfth part of the whole crop, produced on each farm, within the limits ofthe astriction: \" this is a burdensome, and mostoppres sive taxation : the farmers loudly complain of it ; and though their complaints"], [253, "fcl R Tfcre not heard, yet they seem to be reasonable.\" The air is extremely pure, and healthful. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, a free house, and the interest of a mortification of nearly \u00a3300. Sterling. A Society has been instituted here, called \" The Sympathetic Society of Kirk- Patrick Durham ;\" the intention of which is, to provide a source of relief for the sick, and the old, for widows and orphans, and has very deservedly met with encouragement. A considerable Fair is annually holden here, on the last Thurs day of March ; and, some years ago, horse races were established, which have given a great degree of publicity to the place ; these are numerously attended by the Nobility and Gentry, and the Sports ofthe day are always concluded by a Ball in the Evening, in an Assembly-room lately built in the Village, and which is fitted up in a superior style of elegance and accommodation. The Pub lic Roads are in tolerable repair. Peats are very abundant. KIRK-PATRICK FLEEMING, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parishes of Irving, and Kirk-Connel united: the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a360. in money, together with \u00a38.\u201e6..8. for Communion elements, and 5 chalders of victual, one-half of which is payable in oat-meal, and the other in barley : the manse, and offices, are in tolerable con- dition : the glebe consists of 5-j acres, and 14 acres of moor, which, The Rev. Alexander Monelaws, the Incumbent (in 1794), has inclosed and improved at a considerable expense : Patrons, The Earl of Hopetoun, and Sir William Maxwell, Bart., of Springkell, by turns : The Church is in good condition. It it is in the Presbytery of Annan, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Popu- lation ofthe United Parish, in 1801, was 1544, and, in 1811, was 1664. It is 7 m.W.b. N. from Lonsrtown. This Parish contains about 9000 Scotch acres, and is, in several parts, in a high state of cultivation, and covered with thriving Plantations. The impolitic astriction to the Mills are happily abolished in all the farms, except two, which are astricted to the mill of Kirk-Patrick, The climate is rather moist, but healthful. Both the Public, and Private Roads are in excellent repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with the usual School-fees, and some small perquisites, and \u00a35. per annum mortified by the late I)r. Graham, of Moss-Know, and for which the Master is to educate eight poor children. Free-stone, and lime-stone of an ex cellent quality, are abundant. There are four mineral Springs in the Parish ; which, although not hitherto generally known, have from time immemorial, been frequented by the neighbourhood, and justly celebrated for their Medicinal vir-"], [254, "K I R tues, especially Tlie Branteth Well, which is of a strong sulphureous quality the other three are all of the Chalybeate kind, and do not differ considerably from each other, with respect to the qualities of their waters. This Parish still exhibits marks of having been frequently, in former times, the scene of action : of this kind, a circumstance occurred in the Family of the Fleemings, which, on account of the bravery and courage displayed by the determined and resolute band, may justly be compared with the most Illustrious actions of antiquity. The Family ofthe Fleemings, who seem to have been more distinguished for their gallant defence of their native confine, and nobly repelling a foreign foe, than that predatory manner of life, which in these times was styled the spirit and joy of the Borders, in the Thirteenth and beginning of the Fourteenth Centuries, possessed certain lands in this Parish, by the tenure of defending them at all times against the English. Their chief Seat and Castle was at Red-Hall. This Tower, towards the conclusion ofthe reign of John Baliol, in one of Edward's incursions into Scotland, was attacked by an English army, against which it held out three days, though occupied only by Thirty of these brave Fleemings, who defended it to the last extremity ; and who, rather than survive its destiny, or live to see their habitation in the hands of the English, chose all to expire in the flames. Not a vestige of this Tower now remains ; the place only where it formerly stood being pointed out. Two other Towers, at a moderate distance, and both within view, are likewise said to have belonged to the Fleemings : of these, the one at Holm-Head, in this Parish, was only demolished a few years ago : the other at Stone-House, the property of The Earl of Mansfield, is partly standing ; and though at present comprehended within the limits of Graitney Parish, yet, from its standing directly upon the Border, there is the greatest reason to think, that it also, in ancient times, formed a part of the Parish of Kirk-Patrick Fleeming. There are several tumuli, along the South bank of the river. On the estate of Cove, belonging to Mr. Irving, is a large artificial Cave : and in a moss there, a piece of gold inscribed with the word Helenus, was dis covered some years ago. The old Tower of Woodhouse, though not inhabited for many years past, is still standing : this is reported to have been the first House in Scotland, to which Robert Bruce came, when flying from Edward Longshanks : from thence, he carried one of the sons of the Family of Irving then in possession of it, whom he afterwards made his Secretary ; and who hav ing attended him in all his troubles and prosperity, to his death, was created a Knight ; and, as a reward for his fidelity and services, was presented with the"], [255, "KIR lands of The Forest of Drum: and, in a branch of the same Family, it still re- mains. A little to the Northward of this Tower, stands the Cross of Merkland: it is an octagon of solid stone, 9 feet high, and is elegantly sculptured : the time and occasion of its erection are uncertain, but the following appears to be pro- bable ; \u2014 In 1483, The Duke of Albany, and Earl of Douglas, who, for some time, had been exiles in England, wishing to learn the disposition of their coun- trymen towards them, made an incursion into their native land, went to Loch- maben, and plundered the Market there. In the mean time, a Master of Max- well, son of Baron Maxwell, of Caerlaveroc, upon whom the Wardenship of the Borders had devolved, in consequence of his father's imprisonment in Eng- land, receiving intelligence of this affair, assembled his friends and dependants, to repel and chastise the insolence of these Rebels. He came up with them at Burnsivark, where the action commenced, and was fought to Kirk-Connel, when Douglas was taken prisoner, (and finished his life in the Convent of Lindores), but The Duke of Albany made his escape. Having now recovered the booty, and obtained a complete victory, he was pursuing the broken remains ofthe hos- tile army ; and being wearied with the fatigues of the engagement, and the wounds which he is said to have received in battle, was supporting himself with his spear, when a person ofthe name of Gas, from the Parish of Cummertrees, who had fought under him in the engagement, coming up, thrust him through ; in revenge of a sentence, which Maxwell, as Master Warden of the Marches, had passed upon a cousin of his. And this Cross is said to have been erected upon the spot where the execrable deed was committed, to perpetuate its remem- brance to posterity. Here the late eminent Physician, James Currie, was born in 1756 : and, after receiving a proper education at Dumfries School, he was sent to Virginia in a Commercial capacity. The intricacies of Commercial business, however, had no attraction for him, and he returned with eagerness to study medicine at Edinburgh, where, after three years residence, he took his degree of M. D. He settled at Liverpool, and acquired deserved celebrity, not only from his practice, but the candour and benevolence of his heart, his classical taste, and his general information. He afterwards removed to Bath, on account of ill health, and died at Sidmouth, in Devonshire, on the 31st of August 1805. Dr. Currie was well known as the author of a Letter, commercial and political, to Mr. Pitt, published under the assumed name of Jasper Wilson, in 1793, which passed through several editions, and attracted much ofthe public atten tion from its own merits, and from the answers that were made to it. Besides"], [256, "K I R his medical reports on the effects of water, cold and warm, as a remedy in fe brile diseases, he wrote some valuable Papers in the Manchester Transactions, the Collections of the London Medical Society, and The Philosophical Trans actions: And he also edited Burns's Poems in 1800, with a pleasing account of the Poet's life, and a learned criticism on his Writings.

KIRK-PATRICK IRONGRAY, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright : for merly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a manse, and glebe : Patrons, Mr. Ferguson, of Craigdarroch, and Mr. Oswald, of Auchen cruive, by turns : The Church is ancient. It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 730, and, in 1811, was 841. It is 5 m. N W. b. W. from Dumfries. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the Southern bank of the river Nith. The soil, though not very deep, is generally dry, and of a kindly nature : on both sides of the river Cluden, there is a tract of low land ; but, to the Northward and Westward of that winding stream , \u00bbthere rises a Mountain, called Tlie Bishops Forest, which is partly skirted with wood, aud partly cultivated to its summit. The climate is healthy. No services are paid by the tenants in general. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, to gether with School-fees ; and the master is obliged to teach two years in a house near the Church, and alternately other two years, three miles higher up the Parish. Fuel is very scarce, and expensive. A custom prevails all over this country, of carrying the dead for interment to a distant Church-yard, if the an cestors ofthe desceased were buried there : and, in consequence, there are more funerals here from other Parishes than from the Parish itself ; though the inhab- Hants follow the same custom, if they have burying-places elsewhere. Game, of various kinds, is in plenty. Close to a romantic Water-fall which discharges itself into the river Cairn, is an excellent stone Bridge of one arch, called The Routing Bridge; evidently from the noise made by the water immediately above it, and which constitutes a picturesque scene, that is much frequented. KIRK-PATRICK JUXTA, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Mensal Church to the See of Glasgow : the Stipend of which, in 181 1, was \u00a3150., to gether with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse was built in 1788 : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent: Patron, The Earl of Hope toun, as Curator for The Marquis of Annandale : The Church, which was built about the year 1676, is in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery of Lochmaben,"], [257, "K I R and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 596, and, in 1811, was 821. It is 3\u00a3 m. S. from Moffat. This Parish is of a triangular form, each side being about 8 miles in length: it is situate on the South-West side ofthe river Annan. The general appearance is rather bleak, interspersed with moss and muir, and almost without inclosures : the soil is shallow, but dry, and moderately fertile. At the Western extremity stands the Mountain of Queensberry, whose summit is elevated about 3000 feet above the level ofthe sea. The roads are in good repair. The air is rather moist, from frequent rains from the South and South-West, but healthy, and free from agues. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with some small Sehool-fees. The common fuel is peat, which is procured on almost every farm. There are distinct vestiges of a Roman Road, leading from the great camp at Burnswark in the Parish of Middlebie, to a small rectangular encampment in this Parish, called Tatius-Holm, where various fragments of earthenware, and coloured glass, have been discovered. There are numerous Cairns ; and circular inclosures upon the hills : and also several ruinous Towers, the most remark able of which is, The Park of Achancas: the walls, which are about 150 feet square, and, in some parts that are still standing, 20 feet high, are ne less than 15 feet in thickness. This Parish comprehends the lands of White-Holm, in the Shire of Lanark. KIRK-PATRICK, NEW and OLD, v. KILL-PATRICK, EAST and WEST. KIRK-POTTIE, v. DUNBARNY. KIRK-STYLE, v. RUTHWELL. KIRKTOMIE, in the Shire of Sutherland : and in the Parish of Far. It is 3 m. E. b. N. from Far. This is a small Village, situate near the North sea ; into which a lofty Promontory projects, from whence it takes its name. KIRK-TOWN, in the District of Hawick, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. ; the glebe contains about 5 acres ; the manse is in decent repair : Patron, The Crown : The Church is au old, incommodious edifice, and not sufficient to contain the Parishioners. It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 320, and, in 1811, was 287. It is 3 m. E. S. E. from Hawick. There is neither town nor village : but annexed to each Farm-stead are a few Cottages, which are erected, in general, of turf and stone : the Inhabitants are poor and indolent, contented and frugal. From the vol ii. I i"], [258, "K I R purity ofthe air, and the temperance ofthe Inhabitants, fewer diseases prevail here than perhaps in any other part of Scotland. This Parish is 8 miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth. Though without any distinguished Mountains, the face ofthe country presents a continued range of hills, separated only by small rivulets, and gradually ascending from East to West. The soil, in general, is dry, light, and shallow, and is chiefly adapted to the pasturage of Sheep. The great Road, from Edinburgh to Newcastle, by Selkirk and Ha wick, passes through the middle of it. There are vestiges of some wood ; but, at present, not a tree, and scarcely a bush is to be seen in the. whole district. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with perquisites, and a School-house, and Dwelling. KIRK-TOWN-MAINS, v. DRYFE'S-DALE. KIRK-URD, in the Shire of Peebles : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was only \u00a366.. 13.. 10., and \u00a33.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, together with a Manse, and a Glebe of 19 acres : Patron, Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael, Bart., of Skirling : The Church was re-built in 1766, when it was removed about half a mile Westward from its former situation; around it there is a piece of ground appropriated for burying ; but, though this Burial- ground has now been opened for upwards of 30 years, the old Church-yard, for various reasons, is still very much used : the manse, offices, and glebe, which were formerly at a considerable distance from both Kirks, are now in the neigh- bourhood ofthe new one : the manse, and offices, were all new built, in 1788 : the greatest part of the new glebe has been inclosed by The Rev. David An- derson with hedges, at his own expense. It is in the Presbytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 327, and, in 1811, was 387. It is b\\ m. S. b. W. from Linton, and 22 m. S. S. W. from Edinburgh. This Parish contains, by actual survey, 6620 acres English measure ; of which, 600 are inclosed. The surface is finely diversified, and the low or arable land bears almost an equal propor- tion in point of extent, io the high or sheep grounds. The soil is of dif- ferent kinds : towards the small river Terth, it is mostly loam ; in one large farm, is a rich clayey loam ; but the prevailing soil is gravel. Though the air is sharp, it is pure and healthful. The highest Hill is Hell's Cleugh, being 2100 feet above the level of the sea; and, on its summit, is a small cairn, called The Pyked Stane, which is the boundary of the three Parishes of Stobs, Broughton, and Kirk-Urd. The Mansion of Kirk-Urd"], [259, "K I R is a modern building, which was greatly beautified and improved by the late worthy proprietor, John Earl of Hyndford, who left Kirk-Urd, and other valuable estates, to his Grand-nephew, John Carmichael, Esq. , of Skirling. Mr. Lawson has lately built at New Cairn- Muir or Nether- Urd, a large and elegant House ; around which are several inclosures, and plantations of great value. A few Services are still performed by the tenants. Two great Roads pass through this Parish, one of them from Edinburgh to Moffat, the other, lately made, from Peebles to Glasgow : they are upholden by road-makers, and are kept in tolerable repair : the Statute labour was converted some years ago by Act of Parliament. The Bridges are kept in excellent order. The School- master's Salary is 300 merks, with a good House and Garden, and School-fees. Near Kirk-Urd House is a copious sulphureous spring, similar to that at Har- rowgate ; and which has been used with efficacy in several diseases. Coals, peat, and turf, are all used here: and the tenants have a privilege of casting peats in different mosses in the Parish of Linton, and consequently avail them- selves of it. Until 1752, the large estate of Kirk-Urd was the resident property of Geddes, of Rachan, for 1100 years ; while Rachan, from whence the title was taken, is reported to have been in the possession ofthe Geddes's, for 1300 years. James Geddes, of Rachan, who was born in this Parish in 1710, was educated for, and practised several years at the Bar, but died of a consumption before he arrived at the age of 40 : He published an Essay on the Composition and Manner of Writing ofthe Ancients, and left behind him several other tracts. In the Parks of Kirk-Urd are two small Mounts, called The Castle, and Laiv : they are surrounded with a dike of an irregular form : Mr. Gordon, in his Itinerary, thinks them artificial, but does not form any conjecture as to their use. To the East of these is a circular fortification, upon an eminence near Lady-Urd, called The Rings ; and another to the West, on the farm of Loch- Urd, called The Chesters ; hence they are supposed to have been a military erection ; and a place, called Camp-rig-end, one mile South from the last of these, farther confirms this idea. In the Mount-Hill, various antiquities have been discovered. Hair-Stanes, so named, perhaps, from a few erect stones arranged circularly, is said to have been a Druidical temple. In the immediate neighbourhood, is the Kirk-Dean, and Temple Lands. Thirlage is much com plained of here. KIRKW ALL, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : here are Ii 2"], [260, "K I R two established Ministers, who officiate by turns in the Cathedral of St. Magnus: the Stipend ofthe First Minister, which is paid in malt, butter, and money, to gether with a manse, and a glebe, is upwards of \u00a3160. Sterling : the Stipend of the Second Minister, which is paid in nearly the same articles, but who has neither manse, nor glebe, is about \u00a3150. Sterling: These Stipends are paid out of the cumulo rent of the Bishoprick : Patrons, The Magistrates, Town- Council, and Community. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Town, in 1801, was 1921, and, in 1811, was 1715. It is 327 m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here, with tw7o arrivals and two departures weekly, when the state ofthe Pentland Firth admits. An annual Fair is holden here, in the month of August, which lasts about ten days. The ancient Town of Kirkwall stands on the North side of an extensive plain, and towards the South-East side of the Bay to which it gives name : it is divided by a little rivulet which runs through the middle of it, and over which there is a stone Bridge of one Arch, into The Old Town, that bends along the Bay, and The Neio Town that stretches a con siderable way to the Southward. The Old Town bears strong marks of great Antiquity, the Streets being very narrow, and by no means either straight, or of the same breadth throughout : the houses, instead of fronting the streets, are built with their ends to them ; the roofs are very high and steep ; the doors and windows are small in proportion to the size of the building ; and the rooms in some of them are ill lighted, small, and irregular. This, however, is the case only with those that have stood very long, or are very old, especially those on the sea shore, or its vicinity ; for such as have been rebuilt, and particularly those in Tlie New Town, are in every respect different from the others, and are as beautiful and commodious as those of the Towns in the other parts of the Kingdom ; it consists of one street, nearly a mile long, with neat little gardens attached to each house. Since the introduction of the kelp manufacture into Orkney, a great change has taken place in the state of Society in Kirkwall. Country Gentlemen have thus acquired from their bleak estates, sums of money, great beyond all former experience. This has gradually induced many of them to abandon, especially during winter, their lonely and dreary habitations in the Isles, and to draw together in Kirkwall, where they may not only enjoy Society, but can command better education for their children. In dress, and polite beha viour, the superior class of Inhabitants in Kirkwall equal those ofthe South ; in Hospitality they even excel. During winter, there are dancing assemblies and"], [261, "K IR card assemblies, alternately, every week: and popular Lectures on Chymistry were lately delivered twice a week by Dr. Thomas Stewart Traill, a Medical Gentleman ofthe place, but now of Liverpool, and the profits generously given to the Poor. A Public Market for butchers' meat, fish, poultry, or other articles, is much wanted ; and the Magistrate who shall first establish this great convenience, will long be holden in esteem by the community at large. By a Memorial pre sented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in the month of March 1807, by Brigadier General John Randoll Mackenzie, Representa tive in Parliament for the District of Burghs, of which Kirkwall is one, Malcolm Laing, Esq., one of the Magistrates of this Burgh, and Patrick Fotheringhame, Town Clerk thereof, it appears, \" That the chief trade of the Orkney Islands centres in Kirkwall, which is the Custom-House Port, and the only Royal Burgh in the whole County. Its trade consists in the exportation of kelp, corn, butter, fish, skins, linen, platted straw, &c. : and in the importa tion of coals, wood, flax, groceries, manufactures, and other articles necessary for the consumption of the County at large. Its shipping consists of vessels from 60 to 160 tons burden ; and the Inhabitants amount to Two Thousand, composed of merchants, manufacturers, mariners, artificers, and the Gentlemen ofthe County, who reside mostly in Kirkwall, where the Courts of Justice are also holden. \u2014 The Burgh of Kirkwall is situate on the North side of a narrow Isthmus in the Mainland of Orkney, between the Northern and Southern Islands, and at the bottom of a deep Bay, to which cruisers, and vessels fishing on the coast, are accustomed to resort: and vessels on their voyages to the Eastward or Westward, particularly to or from the Baltic, are frequently obliged to run for Kirkwall Roads from stress of weather, or for repairs or supplies. From its local advantages, it has for some years past been progressively improving, and it promises to 'become a flourishing Sea- Port Town. But the Bay is an open Road-stead, exposed to the North and North-East winds, without any Pier or Harbour for the protection of shipping, or the accommodation of trade. Vessels are obliged to lie at anchor about a mile from the shore, and as boats are often unable, to approach the beach for many days, and in the Winter Season even weeks are consumed in unloading and loading a single ship, while the ves sels are constantly exposed to the danger of Shipwreck, of which frequent in stances have lately occurred. \u2014 The want of a Pier or Harbour, for landing and shipping commodities, operates as a discouragement, not only to the trade and navigation of the place, but to the agricultural improvement of the County, in"], [262, "K I R which there is little or no lime-stone, aud no quantity can be imported with ad vantage without a Quay where it may be expeditiously unshipped. \u2014 The place is, moreover, peculiarly and naturally adapted either for the formation of an inner Harbour, or for the construction of a Pier. A narrow neck or tongue of land of hard gravel runs across the bottom of the Bay, forming an outlet ofthe Sea, with an opening at the further end Vvhere the Bason empties itself at low Water, and through which the tide flows to the depth of five or six feet. By cutting across the neck of land at its junction with the Town, and deepening a part ofthe Bason with Jetty-heads without, an Inner Harbour would be formed for the reception of vessels of 160 tons burden. \u2014 Or a Pier extending from the same place Northward into the Bay, with a Jetty-head or Break-water towards the North-East, would form at perhaps a cheaper rate an Harbour equally secure and fully sufficient for the trade of the place. It is supposed, that the sum not exceeding \u00a32500. would suffice the purpose ; and, as the Re venue Vessels frequent the Bay at all seasons of the year, a Pier or Harbour at Kirkwall becomes an object of public utility, as well as the greatest loGal benefit to one ofthe most remote and hitherto neglected portions of the British empire.\" \u2014 By an additional Memorial, in April 1808, they state, that Mr. Telford's Esti mate of the Pier and excavation necessary for forming an Harbour amounts to \u00a33,106.. 10.. 10. Sterling. In their Fifth Report, of April 1811, The Commis sioners observe, \" The Pier intended for the protection of the Road-stead at Kirkwall in the Orkneys, has been carried on by Mr. George Burn with stea diness and effect, so that it is nearly finished ; and perhaps would have been taken off the hands ofthe Contractor before now, had not the progress ofthe work proved the necessity of extending the Pier 120 yards instead of 100 yards ; in order that the Return Pier, which forms the New Harbour or Landing-Place, might be advan tageously placed on the natural Bar, which before produced an imperfect shelter. The prolongation of the Pier was estimated at \u00a3662., and being evidently de desirable and proper, We have not hesitated to engage to pay a Moiety of that Sum towards the expense. We have recently been informed that the Pier, in cluding the Return Pier, is finished, except the Parapet Wall and part of the Causeway from the Town ; and we have the satisfaction to learn from good authority, that since June last, it has served every purpose in the loading and unloading of Vessels that was expected or requisite, and affords every accom modation to the trade of the Place.\" \u2014 The Country Parish, in the middle of which the Town stands, is named St. Ola ; which, before the Cathedral of"], [263, "K I R St. Magnus became the ordinary place of worship, or even perhaps before its foundation, had a Church appropriated to it, which it is well known stood near the shore of the road or bay of Kirkwall. Around its site many of the houses yet standing bear such evident marks of Antiquity, that no doubt can be enter tained of their very early erection ; and these, perhaps, were some of the very houses that, from their situation, had conferred on them, as we learn from Torf\u00e6us, the name of Kirkiovog or Tlie Kirk on the Bay, a name afterwards corrupted or converted into Kirkwall. Even in very old times Kirkwall appears to have been a place of no small consequence ; but the nature of its constitu tion, and the extent of its immunities and privileges, as enjoyed under a foreign Government, we are in a great measure unacquainted with, by want of such documents as might furnish us with information. Its being a place of much note, gives us reason to believe that they must have been more than ordinary ; and whatever they were, they were all, soon aster the cession of the Islands, confirmed to it by a Charter from the Scottish Sovereign James the, Third, erecting it into a Royal Borough, which was confirmed by two succeeding Monarchs ; and the whole rights and advantages it conveyed, were at last so lemnly ratified by an Act of Parliament. The Government is in the hands of a Provost, four Magistrates, a Dean of Guild, Treasurer, and fifteen other Mem bers, which together compose a Council, .who meet at Michaelmas every year for the purpose of alternately electing and being elected, and at other times to collect aud dispense the Public Funds, and transact the other branches of busi ness of the Community. Kirkwall, with the four Northern Royal Burghs, Wick, Dornoch, Tain, and Dingwall, choose one Burgess to represent them in the Imperial Parliament. In this Town, the Courts ofthe Sheriff, the Admiral, the Commissary,* and Justice of Peace, are also occasionally convened for the Ad ministration of Justice ; and for the cognizance and regulation of Ecclesiastical matters, the three Presbyteries of which the Provincial Synod is composed, and also the Synod itself, meet at least once a year, or oftener, according to circum stances. Here is also a Custom-house, and a Store-house, into which are col lected the rents, that are mostly paid in kind, of both the Bishoprick and Earldom ; which are generally let in lease to merchants, who sometimes dispose of them here, and sometimes send them out of the country. The Towrn-House, supported on pillars, and forming a Piazza in front, is in every respect a neat and commodious building ; the first story being divided into apartments for a common Prison, the second for an Assembly-Hall, with a large room ad-"], [264, "K I R joining for the Courts of Justice ; and the highest is set apart as a Lodge, for the accommodation ofthe ancient Fraternity of Free-Masons. To the West of this, and at no great distance, are the School-houses, in which are taught the several branches of English education, Greek, Latin, and Mathematics. Towards the South-East side of the Harbour, there are still to be seen the vestiges of a very rude temporary Fort, thrown up on the spur of the occasion by Oliver Crom well ; and, on the opposite side ofthe Bay, another ofthe same kind has evi dently been marked out, in order that they might co-operate in either annoy ing or protecting the Harbour. Most of the lands in the Parish of St. Ola, that lie round Kirkwall, formerly made a part ofthe Temporality ofthe Bishoprick of Orkney, and were feued either at the Reformation, or on the prospect of the Abolition. Some of them also belonged to the Prebends. As the soil in many parts of them is good, such as have fallen into private hands have been partly inclosed and cultivated ; but those that have been granted to the Town, on con dition, it is said, of their supporting the Cathedral of St. Magnus, and are still in the hands ofthe Community, remain, from various causes, in the same rude and uncultivated state as before, though equally susceptible of improvement : a very great proportion of them is still an undivided Common, belonging jointly to the Town and private Gentlemen, all of which almost is capable of substant ial melioration : and if ever agriculture should surmount its present neglected state here, this Common will not only serve to increase the revenue of individuals, and augment the Funds ofthe Town, but also furnish more ample provision for the inhabitants. The air is damp, though not unhealthy. The harvest generally commences about the first of September, and unless the weather is very bad, it is all concluded by the first or second week of October. The language commonly spoken, is a mixture of Scotch and English, which seems to have superseded the Norse or Norwegian. The fuel that is principally used, is peat and turf, which is procured from mosses at about two or three miles distant. The state of the Roads is very indifferent. To the credit of the landed Pro prietors, the impolitic custom of demanding services from their tenants, is wear ing fast away ; and, with many Gentlemen, they are entirely abolished. The Bay of Ing aness, on the Eastern extremity of this Parish, is so well sheltered from the West wind, which is commonly the most violent here, and so commo dious in other respects, that some sea-faring men of reputation prefer it as a Harbour, even to the Road of Kirkwall. The Bay of Scalpa, on the South side ofthe Parish, is the ordinary landing-place from Caithness. About a mile and"], [265, "K 1 R a half cm the Post -road to Holm, is a Mineral Spring, called Blakeley's Well: it is a Chalybeate, and has been found efficacious in complaints of the stomach and intestines,. Fish, and especially lobsters, are in great abundance : the Linen manufacture is on the decline, but a considerable quantity of Kelp is made here ; and, although the commerce of this place cannot by any means be called flou rishing, yet it is without doubt in an improving condition. \u2014 The Castle^ which is now in ruins, is commonly called The King's Castle ; an appellation which it probably received, from its having been the ordinary residence of the Royal Governors, Chamberlains, or Farmers of the Islands, subsequently to their annexation to the Crown of Scotland. This Fortress, which is situate on the West side ofthe principal street, and nearly fronting the Cathedral of St. Magnus, seems to have been a place of great strength, if we may judge from its extent, the thickness of its walls, and the almost impenetrable nature of its ce ment. The arms and mitre, engraved on a stone on its front, have led to the supposition of its having been erected by some of the Prelates of this See ; but, if ever they had a Palace on its site, it must have been early, and previously to this erection, which took place in the Fourteenth Century, by Henry Sinclair, the first of that name who was Earl of Orkney. Of this ancient Fortress, Patrick Earl of Orkney, after he had been three years in confinement, commanded his natural son to regain possession ; which, at the head of a considerable force, he accordingly effected, and defended it for some time writh determined valour. But he was at length overpowered by the King's troops, supported by artillery advantageously placed, when the Castle was reduced and almost demolished, and he himself surrendered, on the condition that no torture should be employed to extort from him a confession of his father's guilt. \u2014 Towards the East side of the Town, and almost on a line with the Cathedral, from which it is not far distant, stands that ancient ruin, known by the name of The Bishop's Palace. As early as the middle ofthe Thirteenth Century, it seems to have been a place of consequence, as it then accommodated, in one of its upper stories, the cele brated Haco King of Norway, with his Courtiers and Servants, after his return from his last expedition. As this Palace was evidently built at different times, it now exhibits a motley mixture of various sorts of Architecture, and is exten sive rather than regular. Towards the North-East corner of the building, and near the Church, stood a square Tower, called The Mass or Mense Tower, which, from the style ofthe structure, as well as from its very decayed state, vol. ii. K k"], [266, "K I R appears to have been of the greatest antiquity. Almost close to it, there was another, nearly ofthe same form, but of smaller dimensions, which seems to have been re-built, if not entirely erected, by Bishop Reid ; as there were, on several parts of it, the initials of his name cut, on stone, above his mitre and arms : the large round Tower, which, with these, forms a triangle, was entirely a work of his, as a rude statue of him, still standing in a nitch in the South wall, fully demonstrates : these three Towers bounded the Northern extremity of the building, which stretched Southwards, with a breadth of little more than twenty feet, while its length in that direction was not less than one hundred. The walls were high, strongly built of grey stone, and the doors and windows of red free stone ; the latter of which are some of them small, some large, some high, some low, and are very different in their forms as well as in their dimensions. In short, this spacious fabric, reared perhaps in early times, and since often repaired aud altered, has great appearance of irregularity, and is so fast hastening to decay, that, in the course of a few years, there will scarcely be so much of it left, as to mark the place of its foundation. \u2014 The Cathedral, which, considering the time it was built, the people by whom it was constructed, and the place where it was situate, strikes us with wonder, as a performance that shows equal bold ness in the design and pious industry in the execution. Ronald, Count of Ork ney, some time before the middle of the Twelfth Century, founded it in honour of his uncle St. Magnus, to whom it was dedicated. Dr. Stewart, a Reverend Prelate in the reign of James the Fourth, added three Pillars to the East end of it, with a fine Gothick window, which, for beauty, is far superior to any other in the building : and, Dr. Reid, another Prelate, in the reign of the unfortunate Mary, added as many to the West end ; which, on account of his death, per haps, were never finished, and are therefore, in point of elegance, not only infe rior to the former, but to those in the rest ofthe structure. As to its dimensions, the body of the building stretches in a line from East to West, 236 feet ; its breadth through that extent amounts to 56 feet ; the arms of the Cross are 30 feet long and 33 broad ; the height of the main roof is 71 feet; and, from the level of the floor to the summit of the steeple, is nearly 140 feet. The roof, which is vaulted with a number of Gothic arches, is supported by twenty eight pillars, fourteen on each side, besides four of uncommon strength and beauty, that serve to support the spire ; and, while the rest of the Pillars are only fifteen feet, these are twenty-four, in circumference. The present Spire,"], [267, "K I R however, is low and paltry, being built in the room of one that was burned or struck down with lightning ; and which, in all probability, was of such a large size, as to require Pillars of that solidity to support it. It contains an excellent Chime of Bells, which are said to have been a donation from Bishop Maxwell. The East Window, which, in point of size and symmetry, excells all the rest, is 12 fees broad and 36 in height, including one at the top, which was Called a Rose Window, twelve feet in diameter. In the South arm of the Cross there is another Rose Windoic, of the same dimensions, which has lately been renewed and ornamented, through the taste and care of the venerable and senior Clergy- man, Mr. Yule ; and, in the West end ofthe Church, there is a third Window, constructed on the model of that on the East end, but far inferior to it, both in size and proportion. And, though built at different times, and by different persons, this Cathedral must be admitted to be an Edifice not only grand and simple, but also particularly regular. Fortunate in its remote situation, and in the disposition of the people, it escaped the intemperate rage ofthe Reformers, and remains entire to this day, a monument of the exalted ideas of its Illus- trious Founder, and the superb ornament of these Islands. Much care and ex- pense have been bestowed, for preserving it in that state ; and without the most judicious and faithful management ofthe scanty fund allotted for that purpose, it must, long ere now, have fallen into ruins. To support it, neither the Town-Council, nor the Heritors ofthe Country Parish, have ever, in these capacities, contributed any thing, though it is the only established place of Worship which they are bound to maintain ; but the burden has, from time im- memorial, been laid on the Kirk-Session, who, in this respect, have discharged the trust reposed in them, in such a manner as to reflect the highest honour on their integrity. Since the abolition of Episcopacy, the money arising from the Crown rents here, has been sometimes considerable ; and, as it has been annually paid into the Exchequer, applications have frequently been made, but in vain, to procure something from that fund, to support this venerable Fabric. In sev- eral parts of this Parish, are the remains of those ancient structures, well known in many places by the name of Burghs- Castles, or more commonly Picts' Houses: many of them are of a very large size, and all of them are situate in souiq pleasant spot by the sea-shore, generally three, or at least two of them, within view of, and at no great distance from each other : such of them as have been examined, are of a circular form ; and, when measured as near to the foundation as could be effected, they have been found to be from 100 to about 50 Kk2"], [268, "K I R feet in diameter. In the Valley, formed by the Hill of Wideford on one side, and-those of Orphir on the other, there is a deep Marsh, of considerable extent, which has frequently supplied the inhabitants of Kirkwall with fuel. The Name ofthe little Estate of which it forms a part, together with the Proprietor's house, situate in its vicinity, is Caldale ; it lies at nearly an equal distance from the bay of Frith, the bay of Scalpa, and the Burgh of Kirkwall : here various Coins of Canute the Great, and several pieces of silver in the shape of fibulae, were dis covered, inclosed in two horns ; of which a description, and plate, were published by the late Richard Gough, Esq., intituled, The Caldale Coins. The House of Corse, belonging to Captain Gibson, stands on the brow of a green hill, and possesses one ofthe most pleasing situations in the vicinity of Kirkwall. Kirk wall gives the title of Viscountess to Mary O'Bryen, Countess of The Islands of Orkney, and Baroness of Deghmont. Her Ladyship is descended from the Ancient and Illustrious House of Douglas.

It is in the Presbytery of Forfar, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 4421, and, in 1811, was 4969. It is 66 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden in Jnly, and October. It is pleasantly situate near the foot of the Braes of Angus, along the Northern brow of a beautiful glen, through which the small river Gairie winds its course : and from the higher grounds a very extensive prospect is obtained of almost the whole of Strathmore. The air is pure, and salubrious. It is a Burgh of Barony, governed by a Baron Baillie,who is appointed by Lord Douglas, the Superior, and is of considerable antiquity ; but the date of its Charter of erection is unknown. A considerable manufacture of Osnaburghs, and other coarse linen, is carried on here : and from November 1809 to November 1810, there were stamped 3,216,970 yards of different kinds of linen, which might at an average amount to \u00a393,800. Sterling: but this quan tity was far more than was ever manufactured before in one year. Within these"], [269, "K I R two years, the manufacture of Sheeting has been introduced, which is the prin- cipal branch of trade at present. As a remarkable instance of ingenuity it may be mentioned, that about 20 years ago, David Sands, a weaver in this place, and father of the late Mr. James Sands, Baillie of Forfar, wove three shirts without seam : he completely finished them in the loom ; buttons, button-holes, hem- ming, stitching, and ruffles being put to them : one of them was sent to The King, another to The Duke of Athol, and the third to The Society for the encou- ragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce : but the whole benefit which he received was only \u00a35. : He wove cloth of a peculiar kind for Staymakers, saving every part of their labour, except shaping and putting in the whale-bone : but like many other ingenious men, he died unknown, except in the immediate circle where he lived. It appears that there were formerly four Chapelries, besides the Parish Church, and the Chapel in Glen Prosen where the Minister still officiates five or six times a year. There is also an elegant Episcopal Chapel in the Town ; which, as well as the Parish Church, are each adorned with handsome Spires, designed by the late Mr. Playfair, Architect, and erected together with the Chapel itself at the expense ofthe late Charles Lyel, Esq., of Kinnordy: and they are seen through the whole of Strathmore. The Salary of the Parochial School is 400 merks, together with a commodious house, and \u00a31..15..0. Sterling in lieu of garden ground. The Sum of \u00a31400. was many years ago bequeathed to the Minister, and Elders, by the late Mr. Hendry, of Kensington, near London, a native of this Parish: the Interest of \u00a31200. to be expended in educating, and furnishing with books, pens, ink, paper, and other school articles, twelve boys, or as many more as it would educate ; and the In- terest ofthe remaining \u00a3200. to be paid to the School-master for keeping the accompts : Before this bequest could be applied to these benevolent purposes, an amicable process in the Court of Chancery became necessary : at the issue of which, after deducting the necessary expenses and \u00a3150. for purchasing a piece of ground and building a School, the aggregate Sum by the accumulation of Interest was \u00a31651.. 14.. 6. This was laid out in the purchase of \u00a32600.

There are also two private Schools in the Town, and four Schools in the Country district, where Children are taught to read English. Fuel is scarce. A General Post-Office is established here. \u2014 The Parish of Kirrie-Muir is about 8 miles in length, and upwards of 6 miles in breadth. The surface is beautifully diversified ; and the soil is, in general,"], [270, "K I R good ; but, from its elevated situation and moist atmosphere, the harvests are often late, and the grain of an inferior quality. It is watered by the Esk, the Carity, the Gairie, and the Prosen ; the last of which gives the name of Glen Prosen to a considerable district of the Parish. Agriculture is much encouraged here : and there is an inexhaustible supply of fine shell marl in the Loch of Kin nordy, and the Meadows of Logie : the former of which was drained in 1740 and 1741, and the last a few years ago. Kinnordy, formerly in the possession ofthe Ogilvies, is now the seat of Charles Lyel, Esq., and is surrounded with ex tensive plantations. Logie is the seat of Colonel Thomas Kinloch, of Kilnie : near it, are some Ashes and Plane-trees, of very extraordinary beauty and dimen sions ; and to the West of it, about half a mile, is a very copious spring of fine soft water, called Lady Well : where the late Proprietor remembered a large Thorn which overhung the water, and upon which it was the practice to suspend an image of The Virgin, to whom the Well was dedicated.. At Inver-Carily, is a large Gothic Castle of cut stone, and in good repair : and to the East of it, are some vestiges of a wing, which was demolished, it is said, in 1445, by The Earl of Craufurd, in some family feud between the Lindsays and Ogilvies, one of the latter being then Proprietor of the Castle. About a mile to the West of the Town are distinct vestiges of a Roman Road, about 20 feet broad and a mile in length : its further progress being now obliterated by the plough. To the East, is the Forest-Muir, or Forest of Platane : it belonged of old to the Earls of Craufurd, who appointed a Forester over it: the vestiges of whose house are yet visible in the muir, and are called Lindsay's Hall. This Forest was also in the possession of The Earls of Strathmore, and one of their titles was Herit able Forester of the Forest of Platane : it is now chiefly attached to the properties of Kinnordy, Balinshoe, and Phinhaven. According to tradition, it was formerly all wood from the hill of Kirrie-Muir to the Castle of Phinhaven, about 7 miles distant, and trees are occasionally dug up by persons casting turf. History also informs us, that, in the reign of David Bruce, in 1337, Sir Andrew Murray, then Guardian of Scotland, with the Earls of March and Fife, were encamped during the winter in the Forest of Platane ; when hearing of a considerable English army having entered the Kingdom, with whom they were then at war, they marched immediately to Panmure, where a bloody battle was fought, and the English were routed with the loss of 4000 killed, among whom was Lord Henry Mountfort. The greater part of this Forest is now replanted, and con tains between seven and eight Hundred acres of thriving wood. KISHORN, v. APPLECROSS."], [271, "K N A KISIMUL BAY, and CASTLE, v.

This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, bounded on the East by Loch Fine, and on the West by the Sound of Jura; and it is intersected nearly into two equal parts by Loch Swin, an arm of the sea. The surface is mountainous ; but the soil, both for pasture and tillage, is excellent, and there is a great proportion of arable ground. The climate is very rainy, but not unhealthy. The fisheries are prosecuted here with great success. In ancient times, the Chieftain ofthe Clan was entitled to a considerable quantity of cattle and corn, which were con sumed at their feasts ; and until very lately, in this neighbourhood, Campbell, of Auchinbreck, had a right to carry off the best coiv which he could find upon several estates, at each Martinmas, by way of mart. The Island of Islay paid 500 such cows annually, and so did Cantyre, to the Macdonalds ; but the Crown has now converted these Cows at 20s. a head, and taken away this badge of Feudal manners.

This Parish is 20 miles in length, and 16 miles in breadth, being bounded on the East by Loch Fine, and on the West by the Atlantic Ocean. The soil is chiefly of a mossy nature, lying upon a stratum of sand, but in the lower grounds it is a good loam ; very little ofthe Parish, however, is arable, as that which is cultivated, produces such very light crops, that it is found more advantageous to throw it into sheep walks, or pasture lands for cattle. The country is mountainous, and subject to very heavy rains, and the winter months are exceedingly stormy. The roads are bad. The Fisheries are prosecuted here with great success. Fuel is scarce. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have established three Schools here. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. On the North side of the bury- ing ground ofthe ruinous Chapel of Killmory- Knap, is an inscribed Obelisk or Cross, consisting of a single stone, neatly cut, and 12 feet high : on one side is represented a stag chase ; and on the other, the crucifixion of Our Saviour, sus pending a balance. There is also a small Chapel at Killdusclan, on the shore of Loch Gilp.. The ancient property ofthe Macmillans, whose charter was in scribed in the Gaelic language and character upon a rock, at the extremity of their estate, was long contested for by the Campbells, and Macneils, the latter of whom were a powerful Clan in North Knapdale, and was decided in favour of the former by compromise : in that family it continued until the year 1775, when, after the death of the tenth possessor, the estate was purchased by the late Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Campbell, of Inverneil, in whose fa mily it still remains. Of the estate of the Macalasters, formerly by far the most considerable family in South Knapdale, not a single acre is now in their possession : \u2014 and the ancient stock of Macneils, once all powerful in North, and numerous in South Knapdale, are masters of no more than two farms in the for mer, and one in the latter Parish, Sic transit gloria mundi!

It is situate along the West bank ofthe river Tweed; where the Salmon fishings are rented at about \u00a3100. per annum. The ancient Parish of Up-Setlington took its name from the Kirk-town, -which standson the North- Western margin ofthe Tweed, somewhat higher thanNorham, on the opposite bank. The ancient Parish of Horndean belonged to the Monks ofKelso, till the Reformation; when the Parishes of Up-Setlington and Horndean were united, and the whole of the Union assumed the name of Lady- Kirk, in honour of Our Lady, the Patron Saint ofthe Church.

Although this Parish is one of the highest in Scotland with regard to its elevation above the sea, there are in it many Glens and narrow Vallies : it extends, from North- East to South-West, upwards of 20 miles ; the breadth of the inhabited part is about 3 miles ; but, taking its boundaries South and North, it will measure more than 20 miles. It is situate in the District of Badenoch, and is bounded on the North by the Monagh Lea, or The Grey Mountain, a prodigious ridge of inac cessible rocks. The river Spey takes its rise from a very small Lake ofthe same name in the Western parts ofthe Parish, and is formed by currents falling down from the Mountains : it runs through the middle of the Parish, and in its pro gress, besides many rivulets, receives the rivers Maashie, and Truim. Along the banks ofthe river, is a very rich and deep soil ; which, were it not for the dis advantages of inundations, frosts, and mildews, would produce as abundant crops as any in the Kingdom : the lands that lie in the slopes and declivities^"], [277, "LAG without the water-mark, are, though stoney, of a good quality, and very fruitful.

On the South side is the Coille More, or Great Wood, the most considerable remain of The Great Caledonian Forest : this wood, which extends five miles along the side of the Loch, is the scene of many traditions ; and in the middle of it, is a place called Ard Merigie, or The Height, on which a Standard was wont to be erected : here is a spot holden sacred by the most remote antiquity, and said to be the Burial place of seven Kings ofthe ancient Caledonians. At the East end of Loch Laggan, are the remains ofthe old Church, which was dedicated to St. Kenneth: the greatest part of the walls of that venerable edifice are still standing ; and it is sur rounded by a consecrated Burying-ground, that is more frequently used than any other. By a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, on the 9th of August, 1804, by His Grace The Duke of Gordon, \u00c6neas Macintosh, of Macintosh, and Colonel Duncan Macpherson, of Cluny, it appears, \" That a large District of country, in the Shire of Inverness, compre hending the whole ofthe higher and more remote parts of Badenoch and Loch aber, the property ofthe Memorialists, labours under very great disadvantages by the want of proper roads and bridges. The Memorialists are therefore most desirous to open up the communication of that part of the country by a line of road from the Inn at Pitmain in Badenoch (where the present Military road passes from Stirling, Perth, and Edinburgh to Fort George) by the North side of Loch Laggan to Fort William on the West coast. The Memorialists are of opinion, that this line of road would be of infinite service to the inhabitants of Badenoch and Lochaber, and all the neighbouring districts ofthe county of Inver ness, and for the purposes of commercial intercourse among themselves ; and they beg leave to state, that when it is opened, and bridges thrown across the rivers, it will make the best and safest, as well as the shortest and most expeditious com munication yet proposed, between the South of Scotland and Fort William and"], [278, "L A I the West end of The Caledonian Canal, being nearly on the level through its whole course, and from its low direction along the margin of Loch Laggan, (which seldom freezes), it may be travelled in perfect safely at all times and seasons ofthe year, and even in the deepest falls of snow that have happened in the memory of man. From these considerations Lord Adam Gordon, when Commander in Chief in Scotland, ordered a Survey to be made by George Brown, in the view of a Military road being made in that direction from Stirling to Fort Augustus and Fort William, instead ofthe present one by Garviemore over Corry- Arrick, which, from its height, is at all times dangerous, and gener ally impassable for four months in the year, to the prejudice of His Majesty's service, and the loss ofthe lives of many of his soldiers and subjects.\" This road is now in progress, and will extend from the bridge of Lundie near Fort William, through Glen Spcan, by the North-West side of Loch Laggan, to Pitmain in Badenoch, a distance of46| miles.

The Parish of Lamberton, after the Reformation, was annexed to the adjoining Parish of Ayton, to enlarge the Stipend ; and, in 1650, it was dis joined from Ayton, and annexed to the still smaller Parish of Mordington. The Church of Lamberton is noted to have been the place where King James the Fourth of Scotland was married to the Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry the Seventh of England, in the year 1503; which paved the way, first for the Union of the two Crowns, and afterwards of the two Kingdoms. Some allege, that it was built on purpose for the celebration of that marriage. A Tradition has also long prevailed in this part ofthe country, that, on account of the ceremony of his marriage having been performed in this chapel, the King of Scotland granted to the Clergyman of this Parish, and his Successors, in all time coming, the liberty of marrying people without proclamation of Banns. It, however,"], [280, "LAM appears, that the marriage treaty ofthe Princess Margaret stipulated, that she should be delivered to the Scottish King's commissioners at Lamberton Church, without any expense to the Bridegroom ; that she was spoused at Windsor, and the contract consummated at Dalkeith.

This is a vast mountain, in great part covered with heath ; but has sufficient pasture and arable land to sup- port a few inhabitants, who live in a small village of the same name, at the bottom of the Bay. It extends before the mouth ofthe excellent Harbour of Broadwick, securing it from the East winds, and leaving on each side a safe and easy entrance, (though the Southern one is mostly preferred by mariners), where vessels of any size, and almost in any number may lie in safety. This is the place of Quarantine, for the Ports in the Clyde. In the yfear 1558, the Eng- lish fleet under The Earl of Sussex, after ravaging the Coast of Cantyre, at that time in possession of James Mac-Connel, landed in this Bay, and burned and destroyed all the neighbouring country. Buchanan gives this Island the Latin name of Molas and Molassa, from its having been the retreat of St. Maol Jos ; and, for the same reason, it is called The Holy Isle. The cave of St. Maol Jos, the residence of that holy man, his well of most salutary water, a place for bathing, his chair, and the ruins of his chapel are shown to strangers; but the walk is far from agreeable, as the Island is greatly infested with vipers. The Dean of Tlie Isles says, that on the Isle of Molas \" was foundit by John Lord of The Isles ane Monastry of Friars which is decayit :\" but notwithstanding, it"], [281, "LAM contributed largely to the support of other Religious Houses on the Main-land ; the lands round the Bay, and those from Corry to Loch Ranza, being annexed to the Abbey of Kill- Winning. There was also a Castle, belonging to the suc cessors of Somerled ; and whose owner, Angus, Lord of The Isles, gave pro tection during his distresses to Robert Bruce. It is bounded upon the Arran side by hills of red and white sandstone, traversed by basaltic veins. Upon the East side of the Bay, attempts have been made to discover coal, but without success.

LAMINGTON, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Vic arage, with the Parish of Wandel annexed; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a343.. 12.. 6. from the Barony of Wandel, and \u00a314.. 12. .6. from the Barony of Lamington, I65 bolls of oat-meal, and 1\\ bolls ofbear : the manse is in toler able repair: the glebe, at Lamington, consists of 4 acres : Patron, Sir Charles Lockhart Ross, Bart. : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presby tery of Biggar, and Synod of Lothian and Twreeddale. The Resident Popula tion of the United Parishes, in 1801, was 375, and, in 1811, was 356. It is 6j m. SW. b. S. from Biggar. The Barony of Lamington contains about 4000 acres ; of which, 1000 are arable, and tolerably productive, the remainder being high land, and appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The climate is wet, and cold. The Salary of the Parochial School, till lately, was only \u00a3100. Scotch, together with School-fees, and a School-house, which was built in 1788 : In 1738, a sum was mortified by the late Countess of Forfar, for a Bursar to the Grammar School and College of Glasgow, with a vice every 13 years, for a boy born in the Barony of Wandel. Coals are the common fuel. There are several Roman encampments, and strong Towers ; especially that in The Mains, which was built by a Laird of Lamington, ofthe Ancient and Honourable name of Baillie, to whom the Barony belongs. LAMMER-MUIR HILLS, in the Shire of Berwick. This District con stitutes one of the three Divisions of the County, and is a hilly and elevated tract, stretching from near a bold coast on the North-East to Lauderdale, and the marches ofthe high lands of Mid-Lothian on the South-West. The summits of the hills, being covered with heath, give a barren appearance to the whole tract : but, at the foot ofthe hills, and along the sides of the rivulets, there is a great deal of improveable soil, the chief part of which is appropriated to theculture of turnips, and the pasturage of sheep. Upon the hills are numerous vestiges of ancient encampments. vol ii. M m"], [282, "LAN LAMONT, v. K1LL-FINAN. LANARK, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 87 bolls 1 firlot 2 pecks and 2^ lippies of meal, 9 bolls 3 firlots 1 peck and 2j lippies ofbear, and \u00a3528..10..6. Scotch in money: the manse, aud offices, were built in 1757 : the glebe consists of 4 acres, together with the grass ofthe Church-yard, a right of common pasturage in the moor, and a small garden : Patron, The Crown : Lord Douglas being Titular of the Teinds ofthe Borough lands, and Mr. Lockhart, of Lee and Carnwath, of those ofthe remainder ofthe Parish : The Church was re-built in 1777. It is in the Presbytery of Lanark, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Popula tion of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of New Lanark) was 4692, and, in 1811, was 5667. It is 32 m. S W. b. S. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs, which are all well frequented, are holden on the last Tuesday in February, the last Wednesday in April, the last Wednesday, O. S., in May, the first aud second Tuesdays in June, the last Wednesday, O. S., in July, the last Friday, O. S., in August, the Fourth Fri day in October, thefirst Wednesday, O. S., in November, and the last Tuesday in December. It is pleasautly situate upon the slope of a rising ground near the river Clyde, and 656 feet above the level ofthe sea. It is a very ancient Royal Burgh, having received its Charter from Alexander the First ; which, together with subsequent ones from Robert the First and James the Fifth, was finally confirmed by Charles the First, on the 20th of February 1632. It is governed by a Pro vost, 2 Baillies, a D^an of Gurld, 13 Merchant Counsellors, and 7 Deacons of Trades. The Town contains sive principal Streets, besides lanes and closes ; and, since the introduction ofthe Cotton Manufacture, many new Houses have been erected. Lanark is one ofthe Contributary Royal Boroughs with Peebles, in sending one Member to Parliament. A General Post-Office is established here. The Grammar School has always b\u00a3en deservedly in great repute : the Rector's Salary being \u00a316..13..4., together with School-fees, and an excellent School-house, built by the munificence of the late William Smellie, M. D., who also bequeathed his Library to it, which is kept in the room immediately above the School. This appears to have been, in former times, a place of con- siderable note ; for, according to Buchanan, an Assembly or Parliament was holden here by Kenneth the Second, being the earliest that is mentioned in Scottish history : in 1244, it was burned to the ground. Here the gallant Sir"], [283, "LAN William Wallace, in 1297, made his first effort to redeem his country from the tyranny of the English ; taking the place and slaying the Governor, Wil liam de Hesilrig or Hesliope. In 1310, it was finally recovered from the English by Robert Bruce : and, at The Union, Standard weights were trans mitted to Lanark from London. The Castle, which stood on a mount on the South-West ofthe Town, is supposed to have been built by David the First : in 1197, the Charter by William the Lion, in favour of the Town of Ayr, is dated from it : it was frequently in the hands of the English during the Thir- teenth Century, and several coins of Edward the First have been discovered here ; a bowling-green now occupies its site. About a quarter of a mile to the South-East of the Town, are the ruins ofthe old Parish Church; and around it, is the burial ground and cemetery of the Town and Parish. The Monastery of Franciscans, founded here by Robert the First, in 1314, was situate to the West of the present Parish Church : there was also a Chapel, dedicated to St. Nicholas. About half a mile to the Eastward ofthe Town, were the ruins of the Hospital of St. Leonard, which were lately dug up and ploughed. The Hospital Lands now belong to the Borough, and are holden by them ofthe Family of Carnwath, for payment of 20 merks annually, and which, by the Charter, are declared to be for the use ofthe Poor. The Parish of Lanark contains upwards of 6000 acres ; of which, Lanark Moor, consisting of about 1500 acres, is the property of the Community ; and, Lee Moor, consisting of about 300 acres, belongs to the estate of Lee. The greater part is flat, and capable of culture : but, along the Clyde, for more than three miles, the banks are high, precipitous, and rocky ; which are, however, fringed with natural wood and plantations, and form, with the celebrated Falls of the river, the most picturesque and romantic scenery. The climate is pure, and healthy, though subject to heavy rains in July and August. The public roads, and bridges, are in tolerable repair. In one ofthe Parks to the East of Cleghorn House, are the remains of a large Ro- man camp, which General Roy supposes to have been the work of Agricola, pi. 9. ; and, on the opposite side of the river Mouse, was another exploratory camp, which formed the connection with another of a later construction at Castle Dykes, in the Parish of Carstairs. Lanark has generally been supposed to be the Colania, of Ptolomey ; and General Roy has given a plan of its En virons, pi. 27. LANARK, NEW, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : in the Parish of Lanark. This is a charming and populous Village, built in 1785 to accommodate M m2"], [284, "LAN the work people at the Cotton Mills, which were erected there by the patriotic and enterprising David Dale, Esq., of Glasgow. It is about a short mile from Lanark, upon the banks ofthe Clyde. Great attention is paid to the morals of the children, and others at these mills, the Proprietor having always exercised the most commendable care in procuring proper teachers and instructors. LANARK, SHIRE. This Shire is sometimes called Clyde 's-Dale , from the noble river Clyde, which has its source in the upper confines ofthe District; and traversing it in a winding course of upwards of 60 miles, bisects it longitu dinally, and afterwards wafts the trade of Glasgow to the Atlantic Ocean. Its greatest length is about 47 miles, and its breadth about 32 miles : containing 556,800 English acres. This Shire is subdivided into Three inferior Divisions, called Wards, each of which are under the particular Jurisdiction of a Substitute, appointed by the Sheriff Depute of the County. The surface is mostly moun tainous, and appropriated to pasture. This was formerly one of the Kingdoms into which Scotland was divided prior to, or about the time of the Roman inva sion. It also included a great part of the Shires of Stirling, Dumbarton, and Renfrew, being denominated Strath- Clyde ; and Alcluyd, or Dumbarton, is men tioned as the Capital. After the dissolution ofthe petty Principalities, and their Union under the Scottish Monarchy, the greater part of this District fell into the two powerful Families of Douglas, and Hamilton, which still possess very con siderable estates here. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 146,699, and, in 1811, was 191,752. It sends one Member to Parliament. LANERICK, or LENDRICK, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Killmadock. It is 2| m. N. W. from Doune. The Chapel is demolished, but its remains have long been used as a Burial-place for the Family of Lanerick. It is situate on the South bank of the river Teith. LANGHOLM, in the Shire of Dumfries : this was erected into a Parish, in 1703, from the suppressed Parishes of Wauchope, and Staple Gordon, formerly a Mensal Parish belonging to the Bishop of Galloway, part of which last men tioned Parish now belongs to Wester-Kirk : the Stipend, in 1811, was \u00a3150.. 0..0. in money : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patrons, The Crown, and The Duke of Buccleugh, by turns : The Church, which was re-built in 1779, is commodious, but not elegant; it stands East from the Town, on the side of a hill, which, in winter, renders it not only cold, but also, when the frost sets in, of difficult access. It is in the Presbytery of Langholm, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of"], [285, "LAN th's Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of New Langholm) was 2039, and, in 1811, was 2126. It is 70 m. S. from Edinburgh. Here is a good Market. The Fairs are holden on the 16th of April, the last Tuesday, O. S., in May, the 26th of July, called Tlie Lamb Fair (and which is the greatest Fair for Lambs in Scotland), the fourth Tuesday in September, and the Wednesday before the 22d of November. At the confluence of the Esk and the Ewes, stands a small fragment of Langholm Castle, formerly the property of the Nithsdale Family; the Chieftain of which, at the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, was Lord ofthe Regality of Esk-dale, and first erected Langholm, in 1610, into a Burgh of Barony, which is designated in the Charter by the name of Arkin- holm: he afterwards, in 1622, granted a new Charter of erection to Ten Cadets ofthe Family, upon condition, that each of them should build a House in the Town, which is thence called Langholm; along with the houses, of which four only were built, he granted to each of them a merk land; and of these, Mr. Maxwell, of Broom-Holm, still possesses five and a half. The Salary of the Parochial School, including the Interest of \u00a350. bequeathed by John Read, for the educa- tion of poor children, is upwards of\u00a3l6., together with School-fees, anda School- house and Dwelling. A General Post-Office is established here. The Parish of Langholm contains, exclusive of Half- Morton, which is annexed to it, about 14,320 acres ; of which, 12,600 belong to The Duke of Buccleugh, \u2014 1500 to Mr. Maxwell, of Broom- Holm, \u2014 200 to the heirs ofthe late Mr. Lothian, of Staf fold, \u2014 and the remaining 20 to Mr. Little, proprietor of one half of one of the Ten merk-lands of Langholm. The surface, along the banks ofthe Esk and the Ewes, is flat, and, in general, consists of a light loam, which is well cultivated, and very productive : the gentle eminences are covered with verdure to their summits, and are parcelled out into Sheep farms. The wood lands on the bank of the beautiful river Esk, occupy about 500 acres. The climate is very raiuy, but not unhealthy. The Parish abounds in game, of all kinds ; and the rivers in excellent trout, particularly the Wauchope; and there is no district in the South of Scotland that affords more amusement to a Sportsman, either for fishing or fowling, than Langholm. The roads are in good repair. There are inexhausti- ble mosses, within two miles ofthe Town ; and a fine bridge having been thrown over the Esk at Gill-Knocky, in 1793, easy access is thereby afforded to The Duke of Buccleugh's coal-pit at Byreburn, at the distance of five miles. There is also a bridge of three arches over the Esk, where the road leading up into Esk-dale begins, and which unites the Town and the New Village, on the West"], [286, "LAN side ofthe river: it was built by subscription, in the year 1775. And a little way to the Northward, there is another bridge of two arches, upon the Post-road, over the Ewes: these bridges stand nearly parallel, and are only a very short distance from each other, the two rivers uniting immediately between them. Some years ago, Lead was discovered upon the Farm of West- Water, which a Company from Derbyshire have contracted to work. Langholm Lodge, the hand some seat of The Duke of Buccleugh, is much admired for its elegant simpli city, and beautiful situation in the middle of a delightful vale, about half a mile North from the Town. The Roman road of communication between Netherby in Cumberland, and Castle-oer or Overbie, in Esk-Dale-Muir, can still be traced through this Parish : and near which some Roman coins have been dis covered. The principal manufactures are those of woollens. The Castle, which is now in ruins, formerly belonged to the Armstrongs. The Brank, an instru ment of punishment for all excessive exertions of that unruly member the tongue, is always in readiness here. LANGHOLM, NEW, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Langholm. It is \\ m. W. from Langholm. This Village is pleasantly situate between the confluence ofthe Wauchope and the Esk, and is built on a regular plan, on feus granted by The Duke of Buccleugh. It is principally inhabited by tradesmen, and, in 1793, contained about 600 persons. LANGHOPE-BIRKS, v. LANGTON. LANG-NEWTON, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh : an ancient Vicarage, valued, in 1220, at Eight merks: The Church has long been demolished, but the Church-yard continues to be used by those Parishioners, who regard the remains of their ancestors. It anciently belonged to the Monas tery of Jedburgh. This Parish is now annexed to the Parish of Ancrum. See, Ancrum. LANGRIGG, v. WHITSOME. LANG SIDE, in the Shire of Renfrew ; and in the Parish of Cathcart. It is 2| m. S. S.W. from Glasgow. This is now a small Village; but, from the number of ruinous dwellings, it would seem to have been formerly a more con siderable place. The Field of Lang side is memorable for being the scene ofthe last and decisive effort of the unfortunate Mary, in 1568, to regain her crown and authority. Upon the summit ofthe hill are the vestiges of a small Roman encampment, vulgarly called Queen Mary's Camp. LANGTON, in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of"], [287, "LAN which, in 1811, was \u00a328..17..8. in money, 50 bolls of oats, 32 bolls 2 firlots 2 pecks of barley, with a manse which was built in 1766, a glebe of 10 acres of very indifferent Out-field land, and \u00a34. 2..0. of money in lieu of pasturage : Patroness, The Countess of Breadalbane : The Church was built, in 1736, and is in a ruinous stale. It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 428, and, in 1811, was 418. It is 2 m. S. W. from Dunse. This Parish contains about 7200 English acres. The surface rises from the East and South towards the North, where the highest ground is named Langton Edge, and from whence the prospect over the low land of the Shire of Berwick, and Northumberland, is very extensive : in the lower part of the Parish, the soil is generally a light loam ; but there are several fields of a deep and rich loam ; and the whole is inclosed, and well cultivated. The leases are usually for 19 years : the Rent is all paid in money ; and no kain, or services, are asked by the Proprietors. There are two corn mills in the Parish, to which the tenants are thirled ; but this restriction, it is said, is not considered as any hardship. The Salary ofthe Schoolmaster is 300 merks, 10s. for acting as Precentor and Session Clerk, together with the estab lished School-fees, and a small House. Here are several Quarries of good free-stone. Peats, and turf, may be had in the vicinity ofthe Parish, and at a moderate price ; but coals are brought from Northumberland. The Roads are bad. The ancient Village of Langton was a long straggling place, as the name implies ; it suffered, like the rest ofthe Border towns, from the incursions ofthe English, having been burned in 1558, by Sir Henry Percy and Sir George Bowes ; and, at other times, was pillaged by the marauding parties from Berwick and Northumberland. On the farm of Raecleugh- Head, are the remains of two ancient military Stations ; which, it is thought, were occupied during the wars between the two Kingdoms. In the reign of William the Third, there was a considerable encampment of both horse and foot, on the farm of Langhope-Birks : which, tradition says, were sta tioned there at the desire of Patrick Earl of Marchmont, a Nobleman who very deservedly possessed much ofthe confidence of his Sovereign. In 1792, several earthen Urns, of different sizes, were dug up on the summit of the Crimson or Cramestone Hill ; and, in the lands of Middlefield and Crease, are several stone coffins, containing human bones, in the neighbourhood of which is a field that still retains the name of Battle- Moor. \u2014 David Gavin, Esq., the late Proprietor of this Parish, finding a dirty, irregular town so near his House, an obstacle to his improvements, offered the inhabitants to feu, on easy terms, a piece of ground,"], [288, "LAR in a pleasant and healthy situation about half a mile distant. This offer was accepted; and, in a short time, not one stone was left upon another of the old town of Langton ; and the new and thriving Village, named Gavin- Town, in honour of its founder, arose in its stead. Among Hadington's Manuscripts in the Advocates' Library, is a Charter of James the Fourth, dated the 20th of February 1504-5, of the Ostiarius Parliamenti, which was thereby annexed to the Manor of Langton. From the Cockburns, the Manor, and Church, of Langton, were acquired by Mr. Gavin ; whose daughter, The Countess of Breadalbane, now enjoys the estate, and patronage ofthe Church. LANGTON, in the Shire of Selkirk, though locally situate in the District of Hawick, and Shire of Roxburgh; in the Parish of Ash-Kirk. It is 4^ m. N. from Hawick. LANGWELL, in the Shire of Caithness ; and in the Parish of Latheron. It is 7 m. S. S. W. from Dunbeath. It is situate on the banks of the river Lang well, which unites with the Berriedale, a little before it falls into the German Ocean. Here is a strong old ruin, which is said to have been the Castle of Ronald Chein, a chieftain who lived in the Fourteenth century, and was parti cularly attached to the amusement of the Chace. A third part of Caithness be longed to him ; and on his death, his great estate was divided between his two daughters ; one of whom became a Nun, the other married the ancestor of the Lord Duffus. Here is the hospitable mansion of Mr. Sutherland ; the country around which abounds with stags and roes, and all sorts of feathered game, while the adjacent river brings salmon almost up to his door. LANTON, v. NISBET. LARBERT, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Chapelry, with the Cha pelry of Dunipace annexed: the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resi dent Population ofthe Parish of Larbert, in 1801, was 3269, and, in 1811, was 3842. It is 3 m. W. N. W. from Falkirk. The United Parishes are about 8 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth : the surface is, in general, level ; and the soil is partly of alight dry nature, and partly clay, both of which are exceedingly fertile. This Parish abounds with coal, and free-stone ; but coals are at present only worked at Kinnaird, and Quarrole. There are very considerable manufactories ; but especially at the Village of Carron, where the famous Carron Works are situate, and which is one ofthe greatest Iron Founderies in Europe."], [289, "LAR On a dry muir, belonging to Sir Michael Bruce, the great Falkirk cattle Tryst is holden on the second Tuesdays in August, September, and October. The great Roman Causeway from Carmuirs, which crossed the river Carron by a Bridge, West of the Village of Larbert, and which went almost in a straight line to the Castle of Stirling, is still entire in many parts, both in the Parish of Larbert, and Dunipace. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, which is situate in Stone-House Muir, is 300 merks Scotch, together with perquisites, and school fees. There is also a School in the Village of Larbert. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. There are six Heritors in this Parish, each of whom have elegant seats here ; and who, from their general benevolence and patriotic exer tions in the improvement of the country, are justly and highly respected ; these are Sir Michael Bruce, Bart., Colonel Dundas, Mr. Bruce, of Kinnaird, Mr. Strachan, of Woodside, Mr. Cadell, of Banton, and Mr. Miles Riddell, of Larbert. This Parish derives a great advantage from its vicinity to The Grand Forth and Clyde Canal, which unites the Eastern and Western seas. LARDIFF, v. KINLOCH. LARGO, in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 6 chalders of victual, \u00a336.. 6.. 4., and \u00a320. Scotch for foggage : the manse is in excellent repair : the glebe con- sists of 5 acres, and a garden : Patron, Mr. Durham, of Largo: The Church is old, but in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Drumochy) was 1867, and, in 1811, was 1973. It is 3 m. E. N. E. from Leven. This Parish contains 5469 acres, stretching along a spacious Bay to which it gives name, on the Northern Coast of the Firth of Forth : the whole is inclosed, and well cultivated; and the scenery is rendered particularly delight- ful by the numerous Gentlemens' seats and extensive thriving plantations. The air is often damp and cold, but not unhealthy. Coals, lime-stone, and free- stone, are in abundance. The principal manufacture is that of linen. The Har- bour of Largo is formed by the influx of the water of Keil, where vessels of 200 tons may receive or discharge their cargoes. Largo Law, a mountain of a conical form, is elevated about 930 feet above the level ofthe sea. The funds for the support of the Public School amount to about \u00a330. per annum. In 1659, an Hospital was founded here, by John Wood, Esq., a Cadet, for 12 old men ofthe family of Largo, who are accommodated with lodgings, and an annuity of \u00a313. Sterling. On the Western bank of the Keil, are the ruins of the ancient vol. ii. N n"], [290, "LAR Castle of Balcruvie, a place of considerable strength, and formerly a residence ofthe powerful family of Lindsay. Ofthe old House of Largo, only one round Tower now remains, which forms a fine contrast to the elegant modern building, erected as the Mansion-house of that ancient Barony, now the property of Major General James Calderwood Durham. About a mile to the Westward, is the an cient Tower of Lundin, which now constitutes a part of a modern building, in the Gothic style, the property of Sir William Erskine, Bart. This Parish is said to have given birth to Alexander Selkirk, rendered famous by the pen of Daniel de Foe, under the title of Robinson Crusoe. Three large stones (erroneously placed by St. Fond, who gives a drawing of them, between Kirkaldy and King horn) are situate in one of the inclosures of Lundin near the road-side : they are rude, and unshapely, without any figures or inscriptions, and are about 12 or 14 feet high above the ground : and are supposed to commemorate some military event. LARGS, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 8 chalders of victual, and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of 7j acres: Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church is old.

A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the Firth of Clyde. This Parish contains about 19,743 acres : of which, about 4200 are arable, a\u00bbnd the rest are appropriated to pasturage. The soil is light, and shallow, but tolerably productive. The cli mate is particularly pure, and healthy. Few districts exhibit more romantic scenery. The great road, from Glasgow to Port-Patrick, runs through the whole extent of it. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is about \u00a320., together with School-fees. There are several Castles, and Houses of considerable anti quity, in the Parish : particularly Skelmurly Castle, the property of Colonel Hugh Montgomery ; and Knock Castle, now- in ruins, formerly belonging to an ancient family ofthe name of Fraser, and now to Mr. Brisbane. Kellburn is the beau tiful Seat of The Earl of Glasgow, in which Noble family this estate has been upwards of 500 years. Brisbane, is the seat of Thomas Brisbane, Esq., Chief"], [291, "L A S ef the very ancient and respectable family of that name ; in whose possession their large estate, consisting of 9748 acres, has been for several centuries. Here are various tumuli, which are generally supposed to have been raised over the bodies ofthe slain, aster the memorable battle of Largs, between the Scots and Norwegians, in 1263 : in which the latter were defeated with great slaughter. The Poem of Hardyknute alludes to this battle. LARIG-NA-LOONE, PASS, v. RANNOCH. LARIG-EILIE, PASS, v. RANNOCH. LARK-HALL, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark : in the Parish of Dalserf. This is an increasing Village, situate upon the great Road leading from Glasgow to Carlisle. It is principally inhabited by Weavers. LASWADE, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Rectory and Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a370..16..5|* Sterling, 44 bolls 2 lippies of oats, and 26 bolls 1 firlot 2 lippies of barley, together with an excellent manse, which was built in 1789, and a glebe containing upwards of 5 acres of arable land, besides pasture: Patron, Sir George Clerk, Bart., of Penycuick: The Church was built, in 1793. It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. When the Parish of Pentland was suppressed, after the Reformation, the Barony of Roslin, the lands of Pentland, and other Districts of that Parish, were annexed to Laswade ; these districts form the Western di- vision of this Parish : And, in 1633, the Barony of Melville, which had formed the greatest part of the old Parish of Melville, was, upon the Suppression of Melville Parish, annexed to Laswade. The Resident Population of this Parish, thus enlarged, in 1801, was 3348, and, in 1811, was 3723. It is 2 m. W. S.W. from Dalkeith. Here is a good Market for Butcher's meat. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth : it is divided nearly into two equal parts by the river North Esk: on the North, it includes the Eastern extre- mity ofthe Pentland Hills, which is partly covered with heath, and partly with fine green pasture ; on the South, there is an extensive tract of moor and wet moss ; about 1000 acres are covered with wood ; and the remainder, which is by far the greatest part ofthe Parish, is arable, and the soil is rich. Gardening is carried on here to a considerable extent, but especially the cultivation of Strawberries. The climate is extremely various. Here are two extensive Bleachfields, one Barley and two Meal Mills, and five Paper Mills, all in a flou rishing state. The whole Parish abounds with seams of excellent coal, lime stone, and free-stone. Here is a well conducted School, the Salary and perqui- Nn2"], [292, "LAT sites amounting to about \u00a336. per annum, together with a good House. On the banks of the North Esk, which flows beautifully for several miles within this Parish, are many of those favoured spots, which Nature and Art have combined to adorn to an uncommon degree. In the midst of this pleasing Scenery, is situate the House of Ha wthornden, remarkable not only for its having belonged to William Drummond, the Poet and Historian, but also for the caves in the vast precipice beneath it ; and which are thought to have been places of refuge in turbulent times : detached from the principal cave, is a smaller one, called The Cypress Grove, where Drummond is said to have composed many of his Poems. It was in these Caverns that the brave Sir Alexander Ramsay, in 1341, one of the Ancestors ofthe DALHousiEFamily, and who performed such exploits of valour during the contest for the Crown between Bruce and Baliol, used to conceal himself. Here, he was resorted to by the young warriors of the day, who con sidered it as a necessary piece of military education to have been of his band ; and from thence he sallied forth as occasion presented itself, and attacked the English, then in possession of Edinburgh. Near Mavisbank, the elegant Man sion of Sir George Clerk, Bart., is a mound of earth of considerable height, which is supposed, from the various Roman antiquities discovered in it, to have been a Roman Station; aud, accordingly, the late General Roy has pointed it out in his Military Antiquites, as the place where the Romans passed the North Esk, in their way from the South to Cramond. Mr. Grose has preserved three views of the Castellated Mansion of Hawthornden. The Editor of\" Select Psalms in Verse\" justly regrets, that Dryden never undertook the task of rend ering some ofthe sublimer Psalms, nor Drummond, of Hawthornden, any ofthe pathetic ones ; with what spirit would the former great Poet have paraphrased the 24th, the 68th, or the 89th, and how admirably would the42d, and the 137th have suited the delicious melancholy of Drummond's Muse ! See, Melville, Pent land, and Roslin. LATHALLAN, v. KILLCONQUHAR. LATHALMOND, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Dunfermlin. It is 4 m. E. from Saline, and 3| m. N. from Dunferm lin. Here is an extensive Lime-rock, and a large Draw-kiln on an improved construction for burning it : which being of excellent quality, is carried to a great distance by the Farmers. LATHERON, in the Shire of Caithness : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 1000 merks Scotch, besides \u00a360. Scotch for Communion"], [293, "LAT elements, and 6 chalders of victual, half meal, half bear : a manse, and a glebe of 6 acres of arable land, and some grass: Patron, Sir John Sinclair, Bart. : The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Caithness, and Synod of Caithness and Sutherland. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 3612, and, in 1811, was 3928. It is 4 m. N. F. from Dunbeath. This Parish was formerly divided into two Parishes at least, if not more. In the Title deeds of Bor g, a part ofthe estate of Dunbeath, it is called the town and lands of Nether Borg, lying in the Parish of Dunbeath, aud Shire of Inverness: And, in the history of the wars of Scotland, mention is made, that, in consequence of some dissensions between The Earls of Sutherland and Caithness, the former sent 200 men into Caithness, in the month of February 1588, who over-ran the Parishes of Dunbeath and Latheron in a hostile manner. This Parish is situate at the Southern extremity of the Shire, and extends 27 miles Northward from The Burn ofthe Ord, along the Sea-coast, and is from 10 to 15 miles in breadth. The surface is partly flat, and partly mountainous : near the coast, are several Straths, surrounded with high lands, that are covered with heath or pasture : the soil is in some places a strong rich clay, biit mostly inclines to gravel, and Where cultivated, is tolerably productive. The climate, in general, is dry, and healthy. The coast is bold and rocky, but possesses several natural harbours, which are stations for the vessels employed in the fisheries. The tracts of moss and muir ground are immense. The principal Mountains are Morvine, Scarabine, and Maiden-Pap; the former of which is said to be elevated more than a mile above the level of the sea ; and near its summit is a fine spring. There are three small rivers, Dunbeath, Lang well, and Berriedale, the two last uniting within one hundred yards ofthe sea: they all contain salmon, and trout. There are likewise two small Lakes, Ranga and Stempster, where trout and eels are found : on the side ofthe first, are the ruins of a small fortification, and contiguous to the latter are the remains of a large Druidical Temple. A Missionary is at present employed, between the extremities of this Parish and the Parish of Halkirk, who is principally supported by the Inhabitants of those districts. The Salary of the Parochial School is 100 merks Scotch, together with perquisites. The Societv have also two Schools here ; and there are three or four private schools in distant parts of the Parish. The impolitic and detrimental system of unlimited Services is continued in many respects here. There are several old Castles at Berriedale, Dunbeath, Knockinnon, Latheron, Forse, Swinzee, and Clyth : most of them are situate on lofty rocks above the sea, and were anciently places of"], [294, "L A U considerable strength : Part of the walls ofthe old Castle at Achaistal still re main entire, and human bones are occasionally discovered in the ruins : it was built, and possessed by John Beg, third son to The Earl of Sutherland. There are also the remains of many Picts' Houses ; and likewise of several Cairns, some of them of a square, and others of a circular form. LATHRISK, v. KETTLE. LATRICK, v. C AMBUS-LANG. LAUCHOPE, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark : in the Parish of Bothwell. This was the Seat of a very ancient family, the Chief of the Muirheads : it has since passed through several hands. Part ofthe old Tower is still inhabited. LAUDER, or LEDAR, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Rectory, with the ancient Chapels of Kedslea, and St. Leonard's, annexed : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe : Patron, The Earl of Lau derdale : The Church, which formerly stood at the Northern end ofthe Town, opposite to Lauder Fort, was relinquished on the 28th of June 1617, when the present Church was erected in the South-East quarter of the Town. The Chapel of Kedslea stood on the West side of the Lauder, on a site which was actually named Chapel, in a detached part of the Parish of Lauder, on the South. St. Leonard's Chapel stood on the Western side of the Lauder, Southward from the Town, and somewhat West from the site of St. Leonard's Hospital: Richard Morville, who died in 1189, granted St. Leonard's Chapel with its pertinents, to the Monks of Dryburgh ; and \" St. Leonard's Banks\" are still celebrated in Scottish Song. It is in the Presbytery of Lauder, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1760, and, in 1811, was 1742. It is 25 m. S. E. from Edinburgh, and 355-j m. N. b. W. from London. The Fairs are holden on the Third Friday in June, and the 4th of July, August, October, and November. Lauder is one ofthe Contributary Royal Boroughs with Jedburgh, in sending one Member to Parliament. It is noted for an insolent act of Justice done by the Nobility on the upstart favourites of James the Third, in 1482; when, the Nobility who were assembled here with their vassals, in obedience to His Majesty's summons, in order to repel a foreign invasion, took this opportunity to free themselves from their wretched governors, by seizing the favourite Minister, Sir Robert Cochrane, who had been raised from a common Mason to be Earl"], [295, "L A U of Marr, and hanged him and his associates over Lauder Bridge, in sight of the King and the army ; and the House, in which the King also was seized, is still standing. It is a General Post-Office Town. Lauder, and its Territory, were the property ofthe Baliols ; but when they ceased, by forfeiture, to be so, they became, by grant, the Estate of Sir James Douglas. Lauder now followed, the fortunes of that ambitious family, when, by their overbearing behaviour, it was forfeited, and was transferred to The Earls of Angus, who succeeded them also in their practice of domination. At the Accession of Robert the Second, Lau- der was a Regality, within the Constabulary of Lauder. At length, this Town was created a free Borough, in December 1502, by a Charter of James the Fourth, to be holden ofthe King, and his Successors, in free burgage, for ever : this Charter was confirmed by an Act of Parliament, dated the 28th of June 1633. The Corporation consists of 17 members; namely, of Fifteen Counsellors, and two Baillies. The whole Revenue of this Corporation, as returned to Par- liament, in 1788, was only \u00a385. per annum. There is a peculiar custom here ; the King having of old conveyed 105 acres to 105 persons, thereby made 105 burgesses, with this condition annexed to their burgage tenure, that there never should be more burgesses than there are burgess acres. Aster Berwick had ceased to belong to North Britain, in 1482, Lauder was often used as the Shire Town, and the Seat of the Scottish Parliament : but its present appearance is mean, and conveys no idea of its former splendour. This Parish extends about 8 miles from North to South ; but the bulk of it is contained in four miles, upon the Strath of Lauder water : the soil is rather light and sandy ; it is in general fertile, and, of late, has been highly cultivated : the surface rises gradually from the river on each side, to hills of moderate height, mostly green, though occasionally covered with a mixture of heath and juniper. Copper ore has been discovered in several places, but it is not sufficiently rich to defray the expense of working. Muir- stone is abundant, and there is plenty of slate, but of an inferior quality. Adder- stones, and arrow points of flint, commonly called Elf or Fairy arrows, and other stones in the most fanciful shapes, are frequently found here after heavy rains. The air is pure, and healthy ; and this Town has often been called the Scotch Monlpelier. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. Peat and turf were formerly used here for fuel ; but, since the turnpike Roads were made, coals, though transported from the distance of 15 miles, are used for that pur- pose, both in the Town, and country. There are the remains of several circular encampments, commonly called Rings; the largest of which is on Tollis or"], [296, "L A U Tullius Hill. A considerable number of Roman, Spanish, English, and Scottish coins, have been dug up here. Many tumuli are to be seen on Lauder Muir, where, it is probable, some battles have been fought, as fragments of swords, bows, arrows, &c, have been found there. Near the Town, by the river side, stands Thirlestane Castle or Lauder Fort, the principal Seat of The Earl of Lau derdale : it was built by Edward the First, when he over-run all Scotland ; it was repaired, about the end of the Seventeenth Century, and converted into a Dwelling-house by The Duke of Lauderdale, in the reign of Charles the Second: there are some noble apartments in it, which are rich in stuccoed wrork, and one ofthe largest is preserved as a curious example ofthe taste ofthe age. And we are told in a beautiful song, that there is a Peel on Leader-Haughs, \" Which stands, as sweet on Leader-side, \" As Newark does on Yarrow.\" LAUDERDALE, in the Shire of Berwick. This is one of the three Divi sions of the County, being that extensive tract on both sides ofthe Leader water, and which rises from the river to the heights of Lammer-Muir on the one hand, and to the heights of The Lothians on the other. From this District the Ancient and Illustrious family of Maitland, first Earls, then Dukes, and now Earls again, take their title: His Lordship being a Peer ofthe United Kingdom, by the title of Baron Lauderdale, of Thirlestane, Keeper of the Great Seal, and Hereditary Royal Standard-Bearer of Scotland, and a Baronet. His Lordship's ancestors have been, for several centuries, Lords of Thirlestane; and are origin ally descended from James the Second, King of Scotland. The Grandson ofthe first Peer enjoyed the distinguished confidence of Charles the Second at the Restoration, by whom he was, in 1672, created Marquis of March, and Duke of Lauderdale ; and, in 1674, was farther advanced to the English honours of Baron Petersham, and Earl of Guildford ; but deceasing, without issue male, in 1682, these titles became extinct. Here are various Roman, and British remains. LAURENCE KIRK, anciently CONVETH, in the Shire of Kincardine : for merly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. ; the manse was built in 1731 : the glebe consists of 19 acres, and the Kirk lands belonging to the College : Patrons, The Masters of the New College, of St. Andrew's : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Laurence, is too small for the Congregation. It is in the Presbytery of Fordoun, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. This Par ish consists of one large ridge, extending longitudinally from East to West, and"], [297, "L A U sloping gently to its Northern and Southern extremities: and contains 4381 square acres. The soil is fertile, and mostly on a bottom of clay. It is watered by the river Leuther, and its tributary streams. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1215, and, in 1811, was 1309. It is 10 m. N. E. from Brechin. The Fair is holden on the second Tuesday, O. S., in Augusi. The climate is healthy. The Roads, and Bridges, are in tolerable repair. Peats are abundant. There is very little waste ground, and no Common in the Parish : and a great part of it is inclosed. The Village of Laurence Kirk, which is partly the property of The Earl of Kintore, and partly of Lord Gardenstown, is in a very flourishing condition. In 1730, the number of its Inhabitants did not exceed 80 : In 1762, when the estate of Johnston was purchased by the late Lord Gar denstown, they had decreased to 64 : In 1765, this patriotic Nobleman laid down a plan of a New Village, and began to feu lots of land for houses and gardens, and to give leases of small Farms for 100 years, at a low rent, and on the most liberal terms : Settlers flocked rapidly to the New Village ; and, in 1799, it was erected into a Burgh of Barony ; its territory being fixed to the length of the King's Highway, within Lord Gardenstown's estate, and to 838 yards in breadth on each side of the road : The Burgesses are empowered to elect every three years, from the 1st of June 1780, a Magistracy, consisting of a Baillie, and four Counsellors, to regulate the Police and manage the concerns ofthe Burgh ; with the privilege of holding weekly Markets, and an annual Fair on the 3d of January. The public spirited Proprietor also erected a commodious Inn, with a well selected Library adjoining to it, for the amusement of travellers who stop there : His Lordship also encouraged, aud liberally contributed to the establishment of a linen manufactory and bleach-field, which are now in a thriv ing state. A General Post-Office is established here. In the neighbourhood, is a Seat of the Noble Family of Gardenstown. The House of Halkerton, long the residence of the Noble Family of Falconer, and from whence they took the title of Baron, now belongs, together with the estates, to The Earl of Kintore. \" We stopped,\" says Mr. Boswell, \" at Laurence Kirk, where our great Gram marian, Ruddiman, was once School-master. We respectfully remembered that excellent man and eminent Scholar, by whose labours a knowledge ofthe Latin language will be preserved in Scotland, if it shall be preserved at all. Lord Gardenstown, one of our Judges, collected money to raise a Monument to him at this place, which I hope will be well executed.\" This Monument, it is be lieved, has not been erected. vol. ii.

This is a small Village, situate in the bosom of a deep glen, upon the banks of a retired creek, which opens, on the East, into a fine bay. It is a place of little trade ; and neither the herring, nor salmon fisheries are considerable. Its neighbourhood is chiefly interesting on account of its lead, and copper mines. LEAD-HILLS, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark: in the Parish of Crawford. It is 46 m. S. b. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The lead mines here are the most famous and ancient in Scot land. There are two Companies, the most considerable of which is known by the name of The Scotch Mining Company ; and their affairs are conducted with great judgment and economy. The Earl of Hopetoun, who is Proprietor ofthe soil, receives the Sixth bar of lead for rent. The Miners work only 6 hours a day ; and having therefore much leisure time, they employ themselves in read ing, and have accordingly fitted up a public Library at their own expense, to the support of which almost every Miner contributes. There is also a very good School in the Village, and a Chapel. A great part of the lead is sent to Leith, where the silver is extracted from it by a Company established for that purpose. LEALDIE, v.

This Parish contains about 2000 acres of land ; one half of which is carse, and the other dry-field : they are separated by a beautiful bank, from whence there is one of the finest prospects in this part of the Island. It is watered by the rivers Teath, and Allan. Agriculture is much attended to here. The climate is healthy. The roads are bad. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. There are several ancient forts, which are supposed to have been erected by the Caledonians, to watch the motions of the Roman troops that were stationed on the Wall of Antoninus. On the site of one of these Forts is situate The House of Keir, the elegant Residence of James Stirling, Esq., who is the Proprietor of more than one half of the Parish, and whose Family has been long and justly respected for their benevolence, and for their example and influence in the improvement ofthe Country.

KIRKINTILLOCH. LEITH-HALL, v. KINNETHMONT. LEITH, NORTH, anciently IN VER LEITH, within the Jurisdiction ofthe City and Burgh of Edinburgh : formerly a Chapelry ; Patrons, The heads of Families : Both the Church, and Manse, are as old as the times of Popery, but they have undergone a variety of repairs ; the Church received a very consider- able one in the year 1736, when it was in a great measure re-built : they are upholden by the Kirk-Session, wholikewise pay all the Stipend, except 400merks, which are paid by the Parish of St. Cuthbert, in consequence of the Baronies of Newhaven, and Hill-House Field being annexed to North Leith. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (includingNorth Leith, Coal-Hill, The Citadel, Newhaven, and Hill-House Field) was 3228, and, in 1811, was 4875. It is 2 m. N. from Edinburgh. Both a General, and a Penny-Post Office, are estab- lished here. It is situate at the influx ofthe water of Leith with the Forth, which forms the Harbour, and divides the Town into two Districts, called North and South Leith, that communicate by a Draw-bridge over the Harbour. The Harbour, which is the principal source of wealth to the place, has nine feet depth of water at commonNeap tides, and sixteen atthe Spring tides. In thebeginningof the Seven- teenth Century, the Town Council of Edinburgh improved it at a great expense, by carrying out a stone Pier a considerable way into the sea ; and, in 1777, they erected a new Quay on the North side, widening and deepening the Harbour at the same time : it is accommodated with wet and dry Docks, and other conve- niences for Ship-building, which is carried on to a great extent, as many vessels come to Leith from the neighbouring Ports to be repaired. In 1800, the Town Council of Edinburgh, always active in promoting improvements, begun to build a new Bason, with extensive Docks on the North side, which, when completed,"], [301, "L E I will render it a very capacious, as well as a safe and convenient station, for trading vessels of almost any burden. Ships5 indeed, can only enter at full tide ; but The Roads of Leith, which lie about a mile from, the mouth of the Harbour, afford excellent anchorage at all times, for ships of any size. The Harbour of Leith was granted to the Community of Edinburgh by King Robert the First, in 1329 ; and, in 1561, they obtained the Superiority ofthe Burgh by purchase, which has been confirmed to them by the grants of successive Sovereigns. North Leith originally belonged to the Parish of Holyrood-House, from which it was disjoined and, erected into a separate Parish, in 1606. It then compre hended only the Village of North Leith, and the Coal Hill, which are a part of the Barony of Broughton ; but, in the year 1630, the Baronies of Newhaven, and Hill-House Field, which belonged to the Parish of St. Cuthbert or West Kirk, were annexed to it. The Parish is of an oblong figure, extending along the sea shore about an English mile in length, and is a quarter of a mile in breadth : it is bounded by the Firth of Forth on the North, by the Parish of St. Cuthbert on the West, and by South Leith on the South and East. The face of the country is flat ; its soil is light, and sandy ; and it is all inclosed. There are properly no farms in the Parish, and it does not exceed 170 acres; of which, about 20 acres are in Kitchen gardens. The only Heritor is Mr. Robertson, of Lady- Kirk ; the rest are feuars, who hold ofthe Trinity-House at Leith. The air, in general, is sharp, clear, and healthy. It has been much frequented, of late years, for Sea-bathing, and a number of handsome Houses have been erected for the accommodation of strangers. The Tythe of Fish, which belongs to the Kirk- Session, yields annually about \u00a363..10.0. ; but that arises chiefly from the dry fish imported from Shetland, amounting to about 5 per cent, on the Twentieth fish; this was purchased from Lord Holyrood-House, who succeeded the Abbot of that Name (and to which Abbey this Chapel was subordinate), at 1800 merks, and is part of the fund for paying the Minister's Stipend ; but, Mr. Neill esteems this a most ungracious tax, considering that the fish had already paid tythe in Shetland. Lobsters, oysters, and muscles abound in the neigh- bourhood. Coal is the general fuel here. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, besides School-fees, and a few small perquisites. A Sunday-School has been established, which is found to be of great benefit'; and the Master is allowed Five guineas per annum, by the Society for promoting Religious Knowledge among the Poor. At the time of its being made a free Burgh of Barony, by the Queen Reo-ent, Mary of Lorraine, the inhabitants of Leith were divided into four Classes, viz., the Mariners, Malt-men, Trades, and Traffickers, who were"], [302, "L E I erected into Corporations by the same Charter : of these, the Mariners were the most numerous ; they obtained from the same Queen, a gist, afterwards ratified by William and Mary, of one penny duty per ton, on goods in the harbour of Leith, for the support of their Poor ; and for the same benevolent purpose, every Shipmaster or Mariner pays six pence per pound out of their wages ; by which the Corporation is enabled to make charitable donations to a great amount. The four Corporations still retain their Charters : and the Government of the Town is vested in a Magistrate sent from Edinburgh, having the power and Title of Admiral of Leith, and in two residing Baillies, who are elected from the Inhabitants of Leith by the Town Council of Edinburgh. The Bridge is the property of the Town Council of Edinburgh. There is only one Turnpike road in the Parish, upon which there is a Toll-bar close by the Church-yard. At the mouth of the Harbour is a Light-house with reflecting Lamps ; and a Beacon a mile distant from thence. The Town is supplied with good water, and the Streets are properly cleaned and lighted, under an Act of Parliament obtained, in 1771. Leith was strongly fortified by the Queen Regent, at the time ofthe Reformation, and was surrounded with a wall having eight bastions. The Fortifications, erected by Oliver Cromwell, in North Leith, called Tlie Citadel, for the purpose of defending the Harbour, were demolished by order of Government, at the Restoration of Charles the Second, and the ground given to The Duke of Lauderdale ; from whom the Council of Edinburgh, in their ardour for pre-eminence, purchased it at the enormous price of \u00a36000. About the year 1781, a Battery of nine guns was erected to the West ofthe Citadel, in consequence ofthe appearance of Paul Jones ; who, with only three armed ships of small size, had the audacity to threaten the destruction ofthe ships both in the Road and the Harbour : an Officer with eighteen or twenty Artillerymen reside in this Battery, and keep it in excellent order. Besides The Mariners' Corpor ation, to which belongs the Trinity Hospital for -their poor, there is another Hospital, called King James's Hospital, for the poor belonging to the Corpora tions. A considerable trade is carried on betwixt Leith and various foreign parts, but the principal commerce is with the Baltic, for which it is very conveniently situate. The London traders are commodiously fitted up for Passengers, and one generally sails every three or four days. Here are large manufactures of glass, soap, candles, carpets, sail-cloth, cordage, and several iron forges. The Edinburgh Races are holden on the sands of Leith, lying to the South and East ofthe Town.

A Collegiate establishment was made in the Parish of Restalrig, by James the Third, improved by James the Fourth, and completed by James the Fifth, for a Dean, nine Prebendaries, and two Singing-boys: but, this Collegiate erection seems not to have interfered with the Parsonage, which remained entire, until the Reformation : the first General Assembly of the Re formed Church, which met, without authority, at Edinburgh, in December 1560, ordained the Kirk of Restalrig to be utterly destroyed, as \" a Monument of Idolatry:\" and, the Parishioners were ordered to perform their future devo tions in the Chapel of The Virgin in South Leith : the Revenues of the Chap lainries were now appropriated as a Stipend, for the Officiating Ministers of the Parish of Restalrig : in 1609, the Parliament divested the Church and Parish of Restalrig of their legal rights, which were conferred on Mary's Chapel, in South Leith, with the whole revenues, and pertinents ; and South Leith was now made a separate Parish :- The Patronage of this Parish belonged, in 1604, to Robert Logan, the profligate Baron of Restalrig, who sold it to the first Lord Balmerino, the Secretary of State ; and whose descendant forfeited it, in 1746. It is now served by two Ministers : The Patronage of the First belonging to the Crown ; and that ofthe Second, to the Kirk-Session, and Incorporated Trades : The Church-yard, which surrounds the ancient Church of Restalrig, continues to be the Cemetery of the Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Calton-Hill of Edinburgh, Abbey-Hill, Leith Walk, Res talrig, and South Leith) was 12,044, and, in 1811, was 15,488. It is 2 m. N. from Edinburgh. During the reign of Robert the First, a family ofthe name of Logan, according to Mr. Chalmers, obtained a right to Restalrig, with its per tinents. In 1398, Sir Robert Logan, Knt., of Restalrig, sold to the Magistrates of Edinburgh some ground, lying between the river and the houses of South Leith, for the convenience of lading and unlading their ships, and the use of a passage or l-oad between Edinburgh and Leith, through his Barony of Restalrig ; and he gave them also the right of erecting granaries for corn, and of keeping shops for the sale of commodities in the Town of South Leith: such is the origin ofthe rights of Edinburgh, in South Leith. \u2014 In 1555, the Queen Regent, Mary of Lorraine, purchased from Robert Logan, of Restalrig, the Superiority ofthe Town, and Links, of South Leith : and, the Inhabitants of the Town of South Leith advanced \u00a33000. Scotch ofthe price, on an engagement, however, that she"], [304, "L E N would erect South Leith into a Royal Borough : and this the Queen Regent, iu some measure, carried into effect ; she even erected a House, for her resi dence, at South Leith, and she thus attracted several of the Nobles to follow her example : But, the Reformation darkened all their prospects ; and the siege of Leith, in 1560, ruined the whole. In 1566, Queen Mary, amidst her dis tresses, borrowed 10,000 merks of Edinburgh, and mortgaged the Superiority of South Leith, for the re-payment : When the Queen was dethroned, in 1567, the Town Council of Edinburgh, taking advantage of the existing anarchy, took possession of South Leith by an armed force : and, aster various oppressions, the Magistrates of Edinburgh, by watching occasions, at length obtained a com plete title to the Superiority of it. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of the Church of Restalrig. The Calton, is a lofty Hill close to the City, on the North : and round it is a walk, lately laid out, which commands avast extent and variety of prospect. The Hill itself is also a beautiful object ; and on its summit is the Observatory \" a half-finished work,\" and a lesser building belonging to it, in the shape of a Gothic Tower. On the South-West end of this Hill is a Burying ground ; at the utmost verge of which, upon the brow ofthe rock, are deposited the remains of that ornament of his Country, David Hume : over whom a Monument, in the Greek taste, designed by Mr. Adam, has lately been erected. LEMPIT-LAW, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh : a Rectory, anciently valued at \u00a34. : the Ruins of the Church may still be seen, and the Church-yard continues to be used occasionally. It belonged to the Monks of Kelso ; and was, in early times, annexed to Sprouston. Afterwards, Richard Germyne, the Lord of the Manor, granted to the Hospital of Soltre, for the support of that House, and the Paupers, and Pilgrims resorting to the same, the Church of Lempit-Law, together with the Tythes. It is 5 m. E. b. S. from Kelso. LENDRUM, v. MONTQUHITTER. LENEY, in the Shire of Perth : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Callander : The Church is in ruins, but the Church-yard is still in use. This Parish comprehends the village of Kilmahog, of which John Hamilton Buchan nan, Esq. , of Leney, is Superior, and Proprietor. At The Pass of Leney is a beautiful cataract. The site of Norie's Chapel, at Little Leney, is now used as a cemetery by those of the name of Buchannan. LENNAL vi COLDSTREAM LENNOX, SHIRE, v. DUMBARTON, SHIRE."], [305, "LEO LENNOX TOWER, v. CURRIE. LENNOX TOWN, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Campsie. In 1786, Messrs. Lindsay, Smith, and Company, erected a very extensive Calico Printfield, on a Farm of about 30 acres, at the Lennox Mill, or Wester Field, which has been carried on with great spirit and success : another Field has also been laid out there for bleaching Lawns. The workmen are commodiously ac commodated at the New Village here LENTRATHEN, or GLEN TRATHEN, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a351..11..4|., and 49 bolls of victual : the manse is a good house, and in repair : the glebe consists of 4 acres : Patron, Walter Ogilvie, Esq., of Clova: The Church is a new, and elegant fabrick. It is in the Presbytery of Meigle, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 919, and, in 1811, was 958. It is 5 m. N. b. E. from Alyth. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the skirts of the Grampian Mountains, and is of a bleak and barren aspect : The surface is uneven, and the greater part ofthe arable land is a thin, moorish soil ; the seasons are late, and the grain is rather of an inferior quality. It is watered by the river Isla, and one of its tributary streams, called the Melgam, which formerly gave the title of Viscount to the Noble family of Gordon, extinct in 1631: Upon the Isla are numerous fine Water-falls, of which Tlie Reeky Linn, and The Slug of Achrariie, are the most remarkable; Tlie Reeky Linn is a cataract of about 80 feet in height, the rocks are lofty and grand ; and it only requires the ornament of wood, and a little more water to make it altogether equal to Cora on the Clyde: Immediately upon the brink of Tlie Slug of Achranie is a mound, which has the appearance of having once been used as a place of strength. The Melgam issues from a beautiful circular Lake, of about a mile in diameter ; the East Side of which, bounded by steep rocks, is of immense depth ; it abounds with pike, perch, and trout. On the South West declivity ofthe Knock of Formal, near the banks ofthe Isla, are the ruins of a Castle, which is said to have been built several Centuries ago, by Sir Allan Dorret or Dorward, one of the ancestors of the family of Airly. The only Fuel is peat or turf. The Salary of the Parochial School , and perqui sites, amount to about \u00a330. Sterling. Here, as on other scenes of feudal con tention, are numerous cairns.

Sterling in money; together with 50 merks Scotch, and some small services, paid by the tenants of Corse, for serving that Cure : the manse is small, but commodious : the glebe, though not legal, is a piece of the best ground in the Parish : Patron, Sir William Forbes, of Craigievar. The Church is old, and in bad repair. It is in the Presbytery of Alford, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1792, (including the lands of Corse) was 571, and, in 1811, was 390. It is 3| m. S. b W. from Alford. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth. The surface is hilly ; but none of the eminences are of great elevation, except the Hill of Corse ; all of them are covered with heath, and abound with game of various kinds. The arable land is abundantly fertile, but the seasons are in general rather late. The Roads are indifferent. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a good school-house, and a rood of land. Around the Castle of Craigievar, the Seat of Sir William Forbes, of Craig ievar, are several thriving Plantations. The Castle of Lenturk, now in ruins, belongs to the family of Forbes. The Castle of Corse, which was built in 1581, is likewise in ruins, and is also the property of the family of Forbes, which has produced many eminent Divines. LEONARD'S, ST. v. LAUDER. LEONARD'S, ST., in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife: for merly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of victual, one half of which is payable in oats, and the rent of a mortification of an acre and a half of land: But there is no decreet of locality of the Stipend of this Parish on record : And, from the Report transmitted by the Presbytery and the Minister to the Teind Court, it appears, that The College of St. Leonard's, now united to St. Salvator, was endowed by Prior Hepburn in 1512, who conveyed to The College, or the founded persons therein mentioned, certain lands and Teinds lying in the Parishes of St. Leonard and King's Barns, with an exemption from all public or parochial burdens ; and this mortification or endowment is said to have been confirmed by sundry Royal Charters and Acts of Parliament, in virtue of which these lands, have, for 300 years, remained free from all public or Parochial burdens. Prior Hepburn, also provided a Stipend for the Minister of St. Leonard's, which he allocated upon his vassals in the Parishes of St. Andrew and Leuchars; Patron, The Crown. It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's,"], [307, "L E R and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including part ofthe Suburbs of Argyle) was 363, and, in 1811, was 381. The Parish of St. Leonard consists of a few Districts in different \"quarters of the City and Suburbs of St. Andrew's, together with two Farms in the Country, about three miles distant from the City ; all originally belonging to the Priory, afterwards to The College of St. Leonard, and now to the United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard. It is probable, that the erection of the Parish is of the same date with the foundation of the College whose name it bears. Although the Principal of St. Leonard's did not always officiate as Minister of the Parish, and in the instance of Mr. George Buchanan, was not even a Clergyman, it is ne vertheless, certain, that, for some time before the Revolution, the two offices were holden by the same person ; and ever since that period, the Prin cipal of the College has been a Clergyman and Minister of this Parish. See, Andrew's, St. LERWICK, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 500 merks payable out of The Bishop of Orkney's rents, 300 merks from the stent of the Town, 200 merks from the Tythes ofthe Country part ofthe Parish, andlOO merks allowed for Com munion elements : there is neither manse, nor glebe ; but the rent of a house is paid by the Town : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church was built, in 1782, on a very handsome, and commodious plan. It is in the Presbytery of Shetland, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Parish of Gulberwick) was 1706, and, in 1811, was 1949. A General Post-Office is established here ; from whence Letters are diffused over all the Shetland Isles : but a Post-Office Packet direct to this place from Leith, and to sail every fortnight, is much wanted. This Parish, extends, from North to South, about six miles along the sea-coast, and is no where above a mile in breadth : on the East and North-East, it is bounded by the sea, which separates it from the Island and Parish of Bressay, and forms that excellent Harbour, commonly called Bressay Sound. The Parish, and Country around it, are rocky and mountainous. The soil of the mountains is generally peat or moss, and is deep to their very summit. The arable land lies in patches along the sea-coast; where the soil is light and sandy, but as fertile and productive as can well be supposed, from the situation and climate. The highest hill in the Parish rises little more than 300 feet above the level of the sea. The air, though moist, is far from being unhealthy. In the vicinity of the Town Pp2"], [308, "L E R is a Chalybeate Spring, which is generally believed to be efficacious, but it is very little used, and is not highly impregnated. The principal Fishery, carried on by the Inhabitants of Shetland, is that of Ling and Tusk, in the months of June and July ; these are sold fresh to the Landholders, or their Tacksmen, at various prices ; and the annual export of this article is, on an average , 800 tons from all the Islands. There is also a very considerable Her ring Fishery on the coast, which is carried on wholly by Foreigners. But there is no Fishery more universally beneficial, than that of a small fish, called Sel locks, which are both used as food, and afford great quantities of oil. About six tons of kelp are made here annually. The Ebb Tides here run North, and the Flood Tides to the Southward, unless on the North and South extremities ofthe Country, where they run East and West : their rapidity is inconsiderable, at least when comparedwith that of the Firths of Orkney. If a Light-House were erected upon Noss, a small Island East from Bressay, it is thought, that it would be of essential service, as many ships have been lost on the East Coast of Shetland, which such a guide might, in all probability, have saved. The only Harbour in this Parish, is that of Lerwick or Bressay Sound ; a capacious Bay, in which Vessels, well furnished, may ride at all seasons in perfect safety ; and what renders this Harbour particularly commodious is, its having two entrances, one from the South, and the other from the North : On the outside of the North en trance, lies a sunken Rock, called The Unicorn : so denominated, from the Unicorn man of War having been wrecked upon it, when in pursuit of The Earl of Bothwell, who had fled hither, on his way to Norway. The Town of Ler wick consists of one principal Street, next the Quay, with several Lanes branch ing off from it No regularity has been observed, in former times, in the posi tion ofthe Houses, some of which project almost quite across the Street: the general appearance ofthe Town has, however, of late years been much improved by several handsome houses built in the modern style. Here is a straw platting manufactory, but not on so extensive a scale as that at Kirkwall : it is carried on by a London Company : several persons are also employed in the knitting of stockings, and in making woollen bed covers, commonly called rugs. At Ler wick, and indeed thoughout Shetland, Dutch and Danish coins are more common than British \" We had scarcely landed,\" says Mr. Neill, \" when some ofthe Inhabitants asked of me, whether we were direct from Scotland ? \u2014 a question that rather surprised me, as seeming to imply that the Shetland Islands them selves did not constitute a part of that Country.\" Lerwick is the seat of Justice"], [309, "LES and ofthe Admiral and Commissary Courts, and the residence ofthe Sheriff- Substitute. There has not, as yet, been any established School in the Parish ; but there are always one or two teachers of English, writing, arithmetic, book keeping, and navigation in it, who depend entirely on their quarterly payments : those persons, therefore, who wish to give their sons a Grammatical education, are under the necessity of engaging masters from the Continent of Scotland, upon Salaries paid according to their respective subscriptions. This Parish contains about 250 merks of arable land, besides very extensive grass, meadow, and pas ture grounds ; but the merk of land is very indefinite, and here it is not nearly a Scottish acre. There are the ruins of two Popish Chapels, and also of two Picts' Houses. On a rising ground, near the North end ofthe Town, is a Fort which commands the Harbour, and which is said to have been erected during the Pro tectorate of Oliver Cromwell : in the year 1781, it was completely repaired, under the direction of Captain Fraser, Chief Engineer for Scotland, and called Fort Charlotte, after Her Majesty : it was garrisoned, until the peace of 1783 ; and is now in charge of a part of the Royal Artillery. About half a mile South from Lerwick, to a projecting Point, called The Knab, Government has caused a road to be made, by means of which cannon could be conveyed thither in the course of a few minutes ; and here they would effectually command the South ern entrance of Bressay Sound, at least against an enemy's cruiser or privateer. One of the principal means of improvement to this Parish would be good roads ; as, at present, no cart or carriage whatever can be used for the transport of goods on the soft surface, particularly to the Northward \u2022 two roads are therefore espe cially wanted, viz., from Lerwick to Scalloway, the two principal Towns of Shetland, the distance between which is only four miles ; \u2014 and from Lerwick, through the Parish of Tingwall, to the Parish of Delting, and thence to Yell Sound, through the very heart ofthe Country, which is not above 12 miles ; but, in some places, the peat-moss is so deep as to be impassable on Horseback. Near Fort Charlotte, there is a Quarry of very hard sand-stone breccia, in which vast numbers of large water- worn nodules of red granite, are compactly im bedded. See, Bressay, Isle.

It is pleasantly situate on the banks of the Gady, a beautiful stream, sweetly celebrated by Arthur Johnston, in his elegant Latin poems ; and was erected into a Burgh of Barony by James the Second, at the instance of George Dominus de Lesly, with the pri vilege of a weekly Market on Thursday, and a yearly Fair at Michaelmas ; both of which have long been discontinued. This Parish is about 2 miles in length, and nearly the same in breadth. The surface is uneven, but the small hills are arable to their summits ; and, in the lower grounds, the soil is a deep, strong, rich mould, producing good crops, with very indifferent culture. The only manufacture carried on here, is a coarse kind of stockings, in which almost all the females are employed. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, to gether with a rood of land, and \u00a31..13..4., being the interest of a half year's vacant Stipend bequeathed by the family of Leith- Hall. Fuel is expensive. There are several cairns, and two Druidical circles.

Sterling iu money : the manse was rebuilt in 1811 : the glebe is very indifferent : Patron, The Earl of Rothes : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Pres bytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1609, and, in 1811, was 1882. It is 8 m. N. b. W. from Kirkaldy. This is an extensive Parish, lately augmented, and stretching along the North ern bank ofthe river Leven,from which the surface rises with a very slight ascent to the Northern boundary : it is entirely arable, and the soil is in general good, and well cultivated. The principal manufacture is that of linen. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with very moderate School-fees, and a dwelling. Coals, and lime-stone, are in abundance. The original name of this Parish was Fetkill ; but, when the Noble Family of Leslie, Earls of Rothes, became the principal Proprietors, they gave their own name to their possessions here, and the whole District came at last to be known by the same appellation. Leslie House, a magnificent Seat, was built by The Duke of Rothes, round a Court, like the Abbey of Holyrood-House : it was unfortu nately burned to the ground on the 28th of December 1763, but the front of the square was repaired by the late Earl of Rothes, in 1767. The old Castle of Strathendrie, which formerly belonged to a celebrated family of the same"], [311, "LES name, is situate on the Northern bank of the river Leven; in which, about Michaelmas, great numbers of eels are taken in their passage from Loch Leven to the sea ; and, on this account, the lands of Strathendrie were, before the Re formation, subject to an annual tax of some thousands of eels to the Abbey of Inch-Colm. The House of Pitcairn, now in a ruinous state, was formerly the residence ofthe well known Physician David Pitcairn. The Scene of\" Chrysts Kirk on the Green,\" said to have been written by King James the Fifth, is allowed to have been at the East end of the Town, called The Green, or Douglas Croft.\u2014 Was ne'er in Scotland heard or seen Sik dancing nor deray ; Nowther at Falkland on the Green, Or Peebles at the Play.

It is in the Presbytery of Lanark, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Par ish, in 1801, was 3070, and, in 1811, was 4464. It is 6 m. S. W. from Lanark. This Parish is about 14 miles in length, and 12 miles in breadth, stretching along the banks of the Clyde, which are particularly romantic and beautiful. The surface is mountainous ; and the soil, upon the whole, is far from being fer tile, and is more adapted to pasturage than tillage. The climate is damp and cold, but not unhealthy. Coals, lime-stone, iron-stone, free-stone, and slates, are in great abundance. It is watered by the Logan, the Nethan, and the Poniel, which are tributary streams to the Clyde. Part of the Estates of Blackwood, Stonebyres, and some Farms formerly belonging to the Hamiltons, of Raploch, are holden immediately ofthe Crown : all the rest ofthe Parish being either the property of The Duke of Hamilton3 or holden of His Grace in feu. The Salary"], [312, "LES ofthe Parochial School is 400 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and per quisites, and a School-room, dwelling-house, and garden. There is likewise a Salary of 200 merks Scotch, for two schools in distant parts of the Parish, viz., 100 merks for each school, and the heritors or tenants of the district provide a School-room. The turnpike road, betwixt Glasgow and Carlisle, runs through this Parish, which has been in very bad repair, ever since the establishment of the Mail-coach upon it. The turnpike road betwixt Lanark and Hamilton, by the banks ofthe Clyde, likewise runs through this Parish for several miles, and presents a variety of picturesque views to the traveller. The heritors are mak ing laudable exertions to put the other roads and bridges into good repair. The Monastery of the Tyronenses, which was founded by King David the First in 1140, and dependent on the Abbey of Kelso, is now all demolished. Upon a lofty promontory, in the romantic vale of the river Nethan, stand the ruins of Drqffin or Craig-Nethan Castle, anciently a seat of the Hamilton Family, but now the property of Lord Douglas : in this fortress, the unhappy Mary., Queen of Scots, found a short asylum, after her escape from her prison in Loch Leven. In a Farm, called Sadlerhead, an ancient Pitcher, of curious and exquisite workman ship, and materials, being richly plated with gold, was discovered about the year 1807. It is supposed to be Roman, and was very obligingly exhibited to The Society of Antiquaries of London, by The Rev. David Dow, of Cathcart Manse ; and a description, and engraving of it, are preserved in the Arch\u00e6o logia, vol. 16. p. 350. LESSUDDEN, or LYS-AIDAN or EDWIN, i. e.

This Parish consti tutes part of that Peninsula, commonly called Tlie Rhyns of Galloway: it is"], [313, "LET about 7 miles in length, and from 3 to 6 miles in breadth, stretching along the Western side ofthe Bay of Loch Ryan. The surface is much diversified ; adja cent to Loch Ryan, it is almost level, and the soil is light and sandy, with a mixture of gravel; here it is well cultivated, and, in moist seasons, yields excel lent crops of oats, and bear: on the South, the ground is hilly, wet, and spongy, partly green, and partly covered with heath, and there little improvement has been made. The Coast is high, bold, and rocky ; but the fishing in the Irish Channel is very productive. The climate is moist, but mild, temperate, and salubrious. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees and perquisites, and a School-house near the Church. There is also a School at a contiguous Village ; but the perquisites are small, and no Salary has been paid for many years past. Lochnaw Castle, the residence of Sir Stair Agnew, Bart., is a very ancient edifice, and was formerly strongly fortified. The Villages of Clayhole, and Hill-head, in the Eastern extremity of the Parish, are close upon Stranraer, and are separated from it only by an ideal line . Robert Vans Agnew, Esq., of Schuchan, is the proprietor of both of them ; who lets out the ground in small lots for building, at an easy feu duty of 3d. a foot in front, and allows 100 feet behind the house for garden ground : those who choose to slate their houses, are exempted from feu-duty for four years, and this has encou raged many to make use of that durable covering. The inhabitants of these Villages are generally tradesmen, sailors, and^abourers ; and some of them rent small pieces of ground. They are subject to the Jurisdiction of the Custom- House of Stranraer ; and pay Vicarage teind of the herrings taken in Loch Ryan, to the Minister there.

The West ern district is a blackish mould inclining to a reddish clay, exceedingly rich, and well adapted to all kinds of crops : towards the East, it becomes blacker, more wet, and less productive. The climate is healthy. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The roads are bad. Fuel is expensive. LETHINGTON, v. BOLTON.

It is in the Pres bytery of Brechin, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801, was 489, and, in 1811, was 511. It is 7 m. N. W. from Brechin. It is surrounded by the Grampian hills on all sides, ex cept towards the East, where there is a small opening, through which the Wes ter- Water issues , and the plain of the Mearns is seen: the cultivated land is about 5 miles in length, and three quarters of a mile in breadth : but the muirs, and a number of small Farms which lie scattered on the Wester- Water and other small rivulets, extend much farther among the Mountains : the soil is partly a clay, and partly a rich loam on a till bottom, and adjacent to the rivulets there is some valuable haugh ground : the whole of the arable land is about 1200"], [315, "LEU acres. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a318., and some trifling perquisites, together with an excellent school-house, and good garden surrounded with trees, which were planted by the present respectable master. There is also a private School, erected about the year 1750, on two benevolent donations, and is fixed on the Wester- Water about four computed miles from the Parochial School, but it is kept only during the Winter months. Here the industrious and patriotic James Black was born, in 1677 : he afterwards rented a Farm, in the Parish of Edzell, called Wood: to him the Country is indebted for the Bridge of Ganno chie, which was built entirely at his own expense over the North Esk, immedi ately below The Burn, a beautiful Seat, now in the possession of Mr. Brodie, but formerly belonging to the late Lord Adam Gordon, whose genius, taste, and munificence converted the barren wild into a fruitful and delightful Residence. The general Fuel ofthe United Parishes is turf, peat, and heath: the providing of which is a work of great expense and labour, on account of the steepness of the hills, and the distance of the mossy ground. The Roads, and Bridges, are in tolerable repair. The source ofthe Wester- Water is an immense number of Springs, in a large plain commonly called Sauchs, which is about 8 or 9 miles North-West from the Church. LETTEREW, v. GAIRLOCH.

This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadih. The soil is various ; but the greater part is well adapted for the growth of wheat, and agriculture is highly encouraged. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks.

Sterling, by a late eminent Clergyman of this Parish, the famous Covenanter Alexander Henderson. The principal manufacture is that of coarse linens. It is bounded by the German Ocean on the East, and by the river Eden on the South and South-West, which is navigable nearly as far as the Inner-Bridge. The Fairs are holden on the second Wednesday, O. S., in April, and the third Friday, O. S., in October. Fuel is expensive. Sheughy- Dyke, or Tents Muirs, a very large flat district on the East, is now much brought under cultivation. On the estate of Leuchars, containg 3736 acres, lately pur chased from Sir David Carnegie by The Honourable Robert Lindsay, were the remains of an ancient building, called The Castle of Leuchars, which ap peared to have been strongly fortified. Pitlethie, the Seat of Mr. Lawson, is a small Mansion, built with the stones, and near the site of one of the hunting seats of King James the Sixth. The principal Seats in this parish are Air dit, John Anstruther, Esq., Sheriff of the County, \u2014 Pitcullo, Andrew Pitcairn, Esq., \u2014 Earl's-Hall, Robert Bruce Henderson, Esq., \u2014 and, Clayton, David Meldrum, Esq. William Haig, Esq., of Logie, has lately built an extensive and convenient Distillery at high flood mark near the Inner-Bridge, where he exports his Whisky, and receives Coals, &c, at a small Quay close adjoining the Work : he has also a considerable Brick and Tile work, which are exported at Guard Bridge, \\ of a mile from thence. LEUCOPHIBIA, Urbs, of Richard of Cirencester, v. WH1TEHORN. LEURARY, LOCH, v. HALK1RK. LEVEN, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Scoonie. It is 22 m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. This is a considerable Village, situate upon the Eastern bank of the river Leven, at its confluence with the Firth of Forth: forming a kind of beach, for vessels of 200 tons burden. This beach is sandy, and the shore quite flat. It belongs to the Barony of Durie. A General Post-Office is established here. The Fairs are holden on the second Wednesday in June, the first and last Wednesdays in July, and the third Wednes days in August, September, and October. LEWIS, a District of The Long Island, one ofthe largest of The Hebrides. Its Northern extremity, called The Butt of Lewis is in the Latitude of 58\u00b0.. 34' North. It is divided from Harris, the Southern District, by a tremendous ridge of very high mountains, abounding with deer, which, until the game laws were vigourously enforced by the Proprietor, were considered as common"], [317, "LEW property. It contains 561,200 acres : and comprehends the Parishes of Barvas, Lochs, Stornoway, and Uig. By a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, by The Right Honourable Francis Lord Seaforth, on the 31st of March, 1808, it appears, \" That he is desirous to sub- mit to The Commissioners the following considerations, from which, he trusts, it will appear, that the making of a Road across the Island of Lewis, would be an expedient application of part ofthe Funds under their charge, so wisely de- signed for the improvement ofthe communications in The Highlands. The Island of Leicis, politically a part of the County of Ross, of which the Divi- sion called Harris in the Shire of Inverness is a part, extends from Hie Butt of Lewis to The Sound of Harris, and contains a Population of about 17,000 Inhabitants. The East side of the Island is mostly a grazing coun try. The West side of the Island is a grain country, and may, in that respect, be considered as more productive than any other District of The Hebrides or Western Islands of Scotland. All around the coast the seas abound with fish of various kinds, and the principal produce ofthe Island, exclusive of grain, kelp, and black cattle, is cod, ling, and herrings, which are caught here every season, particularly the two first kinds offish in great abundance ; and on the produce of the fisheries the inhabitants of Lewis may in a areat measure be said to depend for the means of paying their rents, and procuring those neces- saries, which are not the produce of their own country. On the East side ofthe Island is situate the Town of Stornoway, which contains about 2400 souls. This small Town has in time past had a considerable trade to the Baltic and Norway, and to the North of Ireland, and the inhabitants have been pretty deeply engaged in the cod, ling, and herring fishery, most of their capital being invested in ship- ping and fishing materials. The Town has been annually increasing ; but one great drawback to it has been, that although situate in a plentiful Island, it is almost cut off from all communication with those Districts productive in the necessaries of life, by means of a moss or muir which extends over the centre of the Island, and which is impassable except on foot. To remedy this has been the study of the Memorialist, and accordingly he has at a very great expense opened up the communication betwixt certain Districts of the Island and Storno- way, and particularly by a road leading from Stornoway across to the West side ofthe Island at the Church of Barvas. A road from the Town to the Penin sula on the East side, called The Aird ; a road along the North coast towards The Butt of Lewis, and he has likewise made a number of Bye-roads iu and"], [318, "LEW about the Town. One great line of road, and that the most necessary of the whole, remains yet to be opened, and that is a road from Stornoway to Loch Roag, which, it is proposed, should proceed by the head of a bay called the Loch Luerbost, in the Parish of Lochs, and from thence across the Island to the head ofthe bay called Kenhulawick, one ofthe bays and inlets that pass by the general name of Loch-Roag : the length of the line would not probably exceed 20 miles, nor the expense the sum of \u00a35000. The road would pass through a moss or muir nearly the whole way, a tract the most dreary and waste of any in The Highlands, where there is not a human habitation, and where the traveller, worn out with fatigue, is frequently lost, of which an instance occurred so recently as February last. Yet in this direction is carried, even on women's backs, most of the disposeable produce of the West side of Lewis sent to Stornoway Market. Loch-Roag, as will be seen by looking at Mr. Arrowsmith's map, or Mr. Mac kenzie's charts, consists of a number of bays interspersed with islands on that part of the coast facing The Flannen Isles. It has always been famous for the great quantity and good quality ofthe Herrings that resort to it, and for the quantities of cod and ling caught there, but except in the Summer season there is no commu nication with it by sea. The coast, and islands, in that quarter produce great quantities of grain and kelp, and it is likewise a good grazing country. By opening up the proposed line of road, the following objects amongst others, would be attained. First, it would enable the tenants of the West and South-West division of Lewis to carry to the Stornoway Market those necessaries of life, of which they have a super-abundance, and of which the inhabitants of Stornoway are always in want, viz., corn, meal, potatoes, cheese, butter, fish, beef, &c. Secondly, on the other hand, it would enable the Inhabitants of Stornoway, to carry over land to Loch-Roag, &c, salt, nets, lines, casks, fishing boats, and other goods of different sorts for prosecuting the fisheries, and for the use of the people inhabiting that quarter of the island. It has more than once happened in former times, that nearly the half of a fishing has been lost for the want of salt and casks, it being not only always dangerous but often impracticable to go to Loch-Roag by sea for six or seven months of the year, and that at a period when the herrings usually appear on the coast. But, should a road be ever opened up in the direction proposed, no such loss or inconvenience would happen, and much prosperity would arise in that hitherto neglected and unknown quarter. The effecting of such an improvement, the Memorialist has much at heart, and should The Commissioners, who have extended their patriotic views to the"], [319, "L I B welfare ofthe most remote districts of The Highlands and Isles, think proper to order a Report, Survey and Estimate of the Road to be made, he will cheerfully on his part contribute the one-half of the estimated expense of the work, and in terms of the Act of Parliament engage to pay the whole of any ex cess which shall attend the execution of it beyond the estimated sum.\" The Commissioners being desirous of procuring a Survey and estimate, which may enable them to form an opinion of the expediency of such an undertaking, it is hoped that it will soon be accomplished; especially as the Ullapool road is essential for convenient communication with the extensive Island of Lewis.

LIBBERTON, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Rectory, with the Parish of Quothquan united, in 1660 ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : the manse was built in 1761 : Patron, Mr. Lockhart, of Carnwath ; The Church is very old. It is in the Presbytery of Biggar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Libberton, Quothquan, and White Castle) was 706, and, in 1811, was 749. It is 2\\ m. S. b. E. from Carnwath. This Parish contains upwards of 6000 acres ; of which, 3500 are in tillage, being a deep rich clay, and yielding good crops without any other manure than what is derived from the fertilizing overflowings ofthe Clyde, with which these haughs are frequently inundated ; the remainder is appropriated to pasturage. It is watered also by the two branches of the river Methven, which unite and here fall into the Clyde. From the remains of antiquity in the neighbourhood ofthe Vil lage of Libberton, it appears to have been formerly a place of considerable im portance. The air is dry and penetrating, but not unhealthy. Peat, and coals, are both brought from a distance. The roads are bad. The Salary ofthe Paro chial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and a house, and garden. Free-stone is abundant. LIBERTON, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 21 bolls 14j pecks of wheat, 50 bolls of barley, 63 bolls of oats, and \u00a323..11..3^T in money; to which an augmentation was made, in the year 1700, of \u00a310., with the appellation of The Prebends' Fee, and \u00a38..6..8. is allowed for Communion elements : the glebe is very inconsiderable, and more"], [320, "L I B than half of it is almost a mile from the manse : Patrons, by turns, The King, and Wauchope, of Nidderie Marischal : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting ofthe Villages of Gil- merton, Kirk Liberton, Nether Liberton, and Upper or Over Liberton) was 3565, and, in 1811, was 4033. It is 2 m. S. from Edinburgh. This Parish con- tains 4140 Statute acres of arable ground, which are very fertile, and, owing to the vicinity of the Metropolis, are rented high. The established School-master has a Salary of 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and 52 merks as the interest of a mortification. There are private Schools also in different parts ofthe Parish. At Gilmcrton, and Drum, are very extensive Collieries, and Lime works. Here is a benevolent donation ofthe late Commodore Alexander Horn, a native of this Parish, amounting to \u00a340. per annum, and which is dis- tributed at Christmas, to certain poor labourers, whose work is mostly without doors, aud who, on that account, may then be prevented from working, by the severity or inclemency ofthe season : the Magistrates of Edinburgh are the Trus- tees of this excellent Charity. The Climate is healthful. There are two small Rivulets, which supply eight mills, besides a considerable Bleachfield, at Peffer- vnill. Craigmillar Castle, a favourite residence of Queen Mary, is situate on a rising ground, about 360 feet above the level of the sea : it has a venerable ap- pearance, and the view from the windows is most delightful. About the time ofthe Restoration, this Castle and Lands came to the family of Gilmour, and at present belong to Sir Alexander Gilmour, Bart. ; part of it is habitable, and occupied by a farmer. Mr. Grose has preserved two Views of this Castle. In this Parish are the Seats ofthe two oldest Families of Mid-Lothian : \u2014 the Lords Somerville, and the Wauchopes: \u2014 the former having acquired the estate of Drum Hall, by marriage in 1375, still possess it ; and the latter have had their residence at Nidderie Marischal, for nearly 470 years. According to Mr. Chal- mers, Liberton is probably a corruption of Leper -Town ; and which, perhaps, may derive some support from the consideration, that of old an Hospital existed at Upper Liberton, where the Church stands ; and whence the place may have been called Spital-Town. There were in this Parish, of old, two Chapels, which were subordinate to the Church : The most ancient was St. Catherine's Chapel, near which there is a remarkable Spring, called The Oily Well, and dedicated to St. Catharine ; in former times, St. Catharine's Well was resorted to, with salutary effect, by persons having cutaneous complaints ; and of supposed"], [321, "L I F miracles of this Well, Boece delighted to tell : the Nuns of Tlie Sheens, on the Borough moor, made an annual procession to St. Catharine's Chapel, and Well: when King James returned to Scotland, in 1617, he visited The Balm Well of St. Catharine : and caused it to be inclosed with a stone wall, with a door, and steps, for the accommodation ofthe afflicted patients : but, in 1650, this charit able building was demolished, and the Well choaked up, by Oliver Crom well's soldiers, who were regardless of its medicinal use : around the Chapel was a consecrated Burying-ground : after the Reformation, St. Catharine's Chapel became a ruin ; and was completely destroyed, early in the Seventeenth Century, by some sacrilegious person, who was remarked by the neighbouring people, not to have afterward prospered: near its site, is a Mansion, which continues to bear the name of St. Catharine's, The other Chapel was dedicated to Tlie Virgin, by Wauchope of Nidderie, the Lord ofthe Manor, in 1389: the descendant of the Founder, re-endowed this Chapel, with a manse, and glebe, for the Chaplain ; reserving the Patronage to his Family ; and, James the Fourth confirmed this endowment: at the Reformation, this Chapelry, and its Revenues, were annexed to the Church of Liberton : the Chapel was demolished, at the Revolution, by the same zealots who defaced the Chapel of Holyrood ; and there remains now only the Burial-place of the Family of Nidderie Marischal. LICKPRIVICK, CASTLE, in the Middle Ward, and . Shire of Lanark : in the Parish of East Killbride. This very ancient Castle, and the adjoining lands were, for time immemorial, possessed by the Lickprivicks, of that Ilk. This Family made a considerable figure long before the reign of King Robert Bruce ; and continued to flourish a long time after. One ofthe descendants was Printer to James the Sixth of Scotland. To this ancient Family was granted, in 1397, for singular services, the Heritable Title of Serjeant and Coroner, in the Lord ship of Killbride, along with considerable emoluments inseparable from the title. This Charter was afterwards renewed by James the First, Fourth, and Sixth of Scotland. The title, with the profits, belong at present to Torrance : the greatest part ofthe Estate is the property of JohnBoyes, Esq. The Castle is completely demolished. LIDISDALE, v. CASTLE-TOWN.

Sterling in money, including \u00a38..14..0. which is no part ofthe Teinds of this District, but of a Grant conjointly to two other Ministers and the Minister of Benvie : the manse is in bad repair : the glebe, and garden, contain about 10 vol. h. R r"], [322, "L I F acres : The Patronage of Benvie is in dispute between The Crown, and Lord Gray: The Church is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801, (including the small Perthshire Division of the old Parish of Inver-Gowrie) was 2194, and, in 1811, was 2442. The Church is about 5 m. W. N. W. from Dundee : but the roads, on all sides leading to it, are in very bad condition. The Parish of Liff comprehended the old Parishes of Logie, and Inver-Gowrie; both of which, as appears from the Records of the Kirk-Session, were united to it before the middle of the Seventeenth Cen tury: But Logie, quoad sacra, has, from the same remote period, belonged to the Parish of Dundee, and a considerable proportion of the Stipend payable out of it, has been allowed to the Minister, who has the charge of the Country Parish there. The United Parishes are about 3 miles in length, and nearly the same yi breadth. The surface rises with an easy ascent from the Tay, except towards the South- East where it joins to the Parish of Dundee. The higher grounds form a ridge, stretching obliquely in a direction from East to West, and behind these, is a bleak, extensive tract of moor, where there are some thriving plantations of fir, and some marks of cultivation now appear. The soil is partly a light loam, and partly clay, and is tolerably fertile. The air is pure, and wholesome. The principal manufacture here is the weaving of linen cloth. Here is a Druidical Temple, and also the vestiges of a Roman Camp. Near to the present Church, and immediately within Lord Gray's inclosures, are some remains of the foundations of a Palace, long known in the country by the name of Hurly Haukin, and which was built by Alexander the First, King of Scotland : but which, however, he did not long occupy ; for, having narrowly escaped assassination there, he, in gratitude for his deliverance, founded the Church of Scoon, and made over to it his Palace and Lands of Liff and Inver- Gowrie. In the neighbourhood of Lundie House, a subterraneous building was lately discovered, containing several compartments ; the whole of which was extremely rude, and the walls were put together without mortar : an elegant Fruit garden, comprising a Pinery and Hot-Houses of every description, accord ing to the latest style of improvement, have been finished here ; and adjoining to it, a Flower and Kitchen garden are now constructing : the plantations are extensive and flourishing. The Anniversary ofthe battle of Camperdown, since the death ofthe late gallant Admiral, Viscount Duncan, has been celebrated by a dinner by voluntary subscription in Dundee, at which many persons attend out of respect to the memory of His Lordship, and, as a laudable incentive, to"], [323, "L I L impress his bright example on the minds of the rising generation : His Lordship having been accustomed to observe that day with heart-felt gratitude aiLundie- House, in the company of his family and a few select friends. The Salary of the Parochial School is 400 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. Coal is the principal fuel. Free-stone is abundant ; and there are several Quarries of gray Slate. The House of Gray is the ancient seat of the Noble Family of Gray ; but the family residence being changed to Kinfauns near Perth, there has lately been no embellishment or alteration made on this their paternal Estate : This great Family is more ancient than that of most of the Nobility of Scotland, and they once possessed more extensive domains in this district : Besides Gray, and the small Parish of Benvie, the estates of Castle Huntley and Mylnefield in the Parish of Long-Forgan, and the Parish of Foulis Easter, are said to have belonged to them : The Family burying-place is still within the Church of Foulis, which, report says, was erected by one of the Ladies, out of pious gratitude for her Husband's safe escape from The Holy War. \u2014 Balrudery, the Westernmost portion ofthe Parish of Benvie, lies upwards of two miles distant from Liff, the Church, Village, and a great part of the Parish of Foulis Easter in the Shire of Perth, being interposed between them. Few ves tiges remain of the Village of Benvie : the ground upon which the principal part of it stood, being now included within the old Orchard, or occupied as part of a Farm : the manse, which is still standing, is converted into a dwelling house for the Tenant. An early Pear in the Orchard, distinguished by the name of Benvie Pear, is ripe about Lammas. Since the Union of Liff and Benvie, they have always, in the Presbytery Records and other public concerns with them, been mentioned together, and termed \" The United Parishes of Liff and Benvie.\" See, Logie.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Hamlets of Chapel, Riddel, and Riddel-Shiel) was 673, and, in 1811, was 755. It is 5 m. S. E. from Selkirk. This Parish contains between 7000 and 8000 acres of land : The soil is various, being partly clay, and rich loam, and partly a gravelly light sand. At the head of the Parish, the river Ale, remarkable for the fine quality of its trout, divides it for a mile, and then becomes the boundary to the North and East. Agriculture has been much improved here, chiefly by the exertions of Sir John Buchanan Riddel, Bart., one of the greatest Proprietors. The principal inconvenience under which this Parish labours, is the distance from coals. The roads are much improved of late : and the Village is more free from agues. In the Inquisitio of Earl David, this Parish was found to have belonged to the Diocese of the Archbishop of Glasgow, before the year 1116: it was aster wards, by the Bulls of several Popes, confirmed to that See ; and there is now paid to that University \u00a35.. 7.. 6-j. per annum, which is called The Bishop's Coat. On inclosing the grounds of Beudie- Hill, the workmen coming to loose earth, soft and black, discovered a great number of human bones, seemingly burnt to a certain degree : the space was upwards of 20 feet in diameter, being of a circular form, and seems to have been an out-post of a Roman camp, the vestiges of which are to be seen in a neighbouring parish, at the distance of three miles. Frequent skirmishes occurred in this Parish with the soldiers of Charles the Second, and military weapons and human bones have been found where those contests hap pened. A numerous party of Presbyterians, who were marching to join their brethren at Bothwell Bridge, being attacked by some troops of dragoons, fled to Bewlie Moss for refuge ; where, being unable to extricate themselves, many perished in the marsh. Riddel is the seat of the respectable family of Riddel, one of the most ancient of the Kingdom : they are said to have fixed themselves here, in the seventh or eighth Century: Walter Riddel, of Riddel, married Violet Douglas, in 936: about, and after that period, grants of land were made by the Kings of Scotland, and by some ofthe Popes, particularly by Pope Alexander the Second: a place of Worship was erected near the House of Riddel, which had a burying-ground, called Chapel Park, and where human bones were occasionally ploughed up : this Burying-place has been transferred to the present Church-yard : on the outside of Riddel aisle, there is inscribed"], [325, "LI N H. R. 1110. There was anciently a Church at Herdmanslun, in this Parish; which, together with the church of Lillies-Cliff, were confirmed to the Bishop of Glasgow by Pope Urban, in 1186. The Barony of Lillies-Leaf was formerly comprehended in the Regality of Glasgow. LIME-KILNS, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : in the Par ish of Dunfermlin. It is 3 m.

Near it, are the pro digious Lime- works of The Earl of Elgin, and which have been carried on from a very remote period. To the North of the Village, is Broom-Hall, the elegant Mansion of The Earl of Elgin. LIME-KILNS, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark : in the Parish of East Killbride.

LINLITHGOW, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally si tuate in the Shire of Linlithgow : formerly a Rectory and Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., besides \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements ; the Town allow annually 100 merks Scotch, in lieu of a manse ; the glebe lies about half a mile from the Town, and being\" small, and not inclosed, it has usu ally been let at \u00a36. a year : Patron, The Crown : The Church, which is dedi cated to St. Michal the Archangel, is a noble piece of Gothic architecture, with a fine spire, ornamented with the figure of an Imperial Crown. It is in the Pres bytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 3594, and, in 1811, was For the Burgh. - - - 2557 For the Parish. - 1465 4022. It is 17 m. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is on Friday. The Fairs are holden on the first Friday after the second Tuesday in January, the 25th of Feb ruary, the third Friday in April, the second Thursday in June, the 2d of August, and the first Friday in November. During the reign of David the First, he had here a Castle, and a Grange, which formed, on this agreeable site, a Town,"], [327, "L I N that was an inconsiderable part ofthe Royal Demesne ; since that period, it has received several Charters, which were confirmed, in 1540, by a writ of n-ovoda mus from James the Fifth, by which the government of the Burgh was vested in a Provost, four Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, twelve Merchant Counsellors, and the Deacons of the Eight Incorporated trades. The Magis trates and other Members of the Town Council, with the Corporations and Seven Fraternities, make an annual procession on horseback, in the month of June, which is termed, \" Riding their Marches.\" The Revenue of the Town, which arises chiefly from the Mills, and Customs, amounts to about \u00a3400. per annum. Linlithgow, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Peebles, Sel kirk, and Lanark, sends one Member to Parliament. It is a Post-Office Town; and was anciently a place of great trade, and opulence, and had first the Harbour of Blackness, and afterwards that of Queen's Ferry, assigned to it as its Port. Its Criminal Courts are holden at Edinburgh. The Family of Livingstone, who took the title of Earl from this place, were Hereditary Keepers of the Palace, Bailiffs of the Royal Demesne, and Constables of Blackness Castle ; but, by their concern in the Rebellion of 1715, all these Honours, and their Estates, were forfeited to the Crown ; and the King granted them to the Family of Hamilton. On the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, in 1747, The Earl of Hopetoun then claimed for the Sherijfdom of Linlithgow, redeemable, \u00a33000. Under the new regimen, Jchn Gillon, of Wellhouse, Advocate, was appointed Sheriff- Depute of Linlithgow, and Bathgate, at a Salary of \u00a3150. per annum. The pre sent Parish of Linlithgow comprehends the ancient Parishes of Linlithgow, and Binning, which were united after the Reformation. It is supposed to contain 7600 Scotch acres : it is bounded by the river Avon on the West, which divides this County from that of Stirling: and on the opposite side, is a House and Field, near the Bridge, that belong to this Parish, from whence it is inferred that the river has altered its course : towards the South the surface is hilly, and the soil a cold clay : the North, West, and East parts are a light free soil : and it is in general well cultivated, and almost the whole is inclosed and sheltered with stripes of plantation. Cocklerue, the highest land on the West, is elevated about 500 feet above'the level of the sea ; and, opposite to it, on the East is Binny Craig, nearly ofthe same height, and formerly considered as a favourite haunt of Fairies. The high grounds, in the middle, take their name from the small Village of Riccarton, which lies at the foot of them. The roads through the Parish, in all directions, are excellent Here is abundance of Lime-stone,"], [328, "L I N of an excellent quality. The chief manufacture is Leather ; though the art of tanning is said to have been imperfectly known here, until some of Cromwell's soldiers both instructed others, and practised it themselves : \u2014 Shoe-making, and the Woollen trade, are also carried on to a considerable extent ; \u2014 and, about a mile from the Town, a Bleach-field and Print-field, on a large scale, have been established. Coals are the only fuel used here. From its natural healthiness, as well as easy access, Linlithgow is peculiarly adapted for a place of Educa- tion: the Rector has a Salary of 400 merks, together with a House, and Garden : the Master who teaches English and Writing, has about \u00a314. a year ; which, as well as the Rector's Salary, are entirely paid by the Town. The Palace, which was built on the site of a Roman Station, stands upon an eminence that projects almost into the middle ofthe Loch ; it was one ofthe noblest ofthe Royal Re- sidences ; and, even in ruins, appears majestic. It was greatly ornamented by James the Fifth ; and one side ofthe grand square was entirely built by James the Sixth, and kept in good repair, till 1745, when it was accidentally set on fire by the King's forces, who had been accommodated with lodgings in the Parliament Hall. The other sides ofthe square are far more ancient, with long Halls, and Galleries, communicating with the rooms : in one ofthe.se, on the 8th of December 1542, the unfortunate Queen Mary was born : her father James the Fifth, then dying of a broken heart for his misfortunes at Solway Moss, predicted the miseries which impended over her and Scotland ; \" The Kingdom,\" said he, \" came with a Lass, and it will be lost with one.\" Sir Thomas Livingston, Bart., is now Honorary Keeper ofthe Palaces of Linlithgow and Blackness. The Town-House is an elegant building, erected in 1668 ; and immediately opposite to it is the Cross- Well, built in 1620, and distinguished by a variety of grotesque figures. In the Town also, there was a Monastery ofthe Carmelites founded by the Citizens, in 1290 ; and near it, an Hospital of the Lazarites, dedicated to St. Alary Mag- dalen. On an eminence, in the South East part ofthe Parish, above Ochiltree Mill, are the remains of an ancient Military Station : and, some years ago, several Roman Coins were discovered in the Borough-muir. When Edward the First came to assert his claim to the Superiority of Scotland, he laid with his vast army, the night before the battle of Falkirk, on the Borough-muir. Here The Earl of Lennox lost his life, in the bloody conflict with The Earl of Arran, during the minority of James the Fifth. In one ofthe Streets, is shown the gallery from whence the Regent Murray was shot, in 1570, \" with a blameless revenge\" by Hamilton, of Bothwell-Haugh. According to Mr. Chalmers, Lin-"], [329, "L I N lithgow alone has the honour or the shame, of having burnt, in 1662, \" The Solemn League and Covenant,\" that wretched tissue of fanaticism and faction. During the plague in 1646, which made such dreadful havock in Edinburgh, The Courts of Justice were transferred to Linlithgow, and holden in the Palace : and the Professors of The University are also said to have removed hither at that awful time. Ninian Winzet, the great opponent of John Knox, was formerly the Rector ofthe School here. But, ofthe several persons connected with this Parish, it would be unpardonable not to name, Robert Henry, D. D., a Gen- tleman well known to the world by his valuable History ; and who, having expe- rienced the pleasure of knowledge himself, benevolently wished others to share the same : with that view, he bequeathed his books, under certain regulations, to the Magistrates and Town Council, and Ministers of the Presbytery of Lin- lithgow, as the foundation of a larger Collection ; and which, much to the honom ofthe Guardians of this sacred trust, are now carefully arranged and preserved in a commodious apartment in the Town -House. During the struggle between Edward the First and the Scotch Patriots, the garrison stationed here by that Prince were dispossessed of it by a curious device of William Binnoch. He supplied the Castle with hay, and being well known, had free access at all times. He proposed to Bruce to conceal some men in his cart. Being introduced with- out suspicion, and completely armed, they easily made themselves masters of it. This Story is generally believed. Binnoch was rewarded for this service with some lands in the South ofthe Parish, which still bear that name, a little softened. TheBiNNiNGS, of Wallyford, were said to be descended from him ; and, in allusion to that transaction, had for their arms, a Hay Wain, with this Motto, \" Virtute doloque.\" Mr. Grose, has preserved a view of the Palace. Tartreven Castleh&s, long been in ruins. The Lake abounds with pike, perch, and eels ; and considerable quantities ofthe latter are collared, and sent to different parts ofthe Kingdom. LINLITHGOW-BRIDGE, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Muir- Avon-Side. This is an increasing Village. LINLITHGOW, SHIRE, or WEST LOTHIAN. This Shire is about 19 miles in length, and 13 miles in breadth, stretching along the Southern shore of the Firth of Forth and containing about 57,000 Scotch acres, the customary measure : of which, nearly a fifth part has never been cultivated, being partly a thin wet soil, and partly high rocky grounds, inaccessible to the plough ; the other four-fifths are all, either in tillage, pasture, or woods. The soil is various ; but, in general, it is a rich loam, and highly cultivated. It abounds with coals, vol. h. S s"], [330, "L I N lime-stone, iron-stone, and lead ore. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 17,844, and, in 1811, was 19,451. It sends one Member to Par liament. The Criminal Courts are holden at Edinburgh. Here are various Roman remains. LINTON, v. PRESTON-KIRK. LINTON, in the Shire of Peebles : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a glebe: the manse was re built in 1779: Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry: when the old Church of Linton was pulled down, in 1782, it appeared to have been built with stones of a more ancient Fabric. It is in the Presbytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Town of Linton, the Village of Blyth, and the Country district) was 1064, and, in 1811, was 1186. It is 16| m. S. S. W. from Edin burgh, and is a Post-Office Town. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden invariably on the third Wednesday of June, O. S., and on that day week. It is said to have been a\" Borough of Regality, having The Earl of March for its Superior, who distributed Justice by his Sheriff-depute : but, on the abolition of Heritable Jurisdictions, in 1747, The Earl of March claimed no thing for the Regality of Linton, but was allowed a compensation for the Regal ity of Newlands. This Parish contains about 25 square miles. It is situate among the hills, which border on the Shire of Edinburgh, and is watered by the rivers Lyne, and North Esk. The surface is generally mountainous ; but the banks ofthe rivers contain about 900 acres, which are exceedingly fertile, and are under good cultivation : the principal attention, however, ofthe Farmer is di rected to the breeding of sheep, for which this country is well adapted. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. Free-stone, coals, and lime-stone are abund ant: and there are several extensive beds of excellent marl. About a mile North from Linton, in Mr. Chatto's land, is a Spring, called Heaven- Aqua Well, which somewhat resembles the Tunbridge watersv The School-master's Salary is 300 merks, together with perquisites, and a House, and Garden. An Act was obtained for the Linton and Noble-House Roads, from Edinburgh to Moffat, aboutthe year 1756. They are made, and now upholden at 50s. per mile ; Statute labour is commuted. In a deep sequestered glen in the land of Carlops, at the junction of two deep glens which communicate with the first, stands a projecting Rock of freestone, forming a natural nich, with an impending canopy ; it is called Harbour- Craig ; and, it is said, was a retreat of Conventiclers under"], [331, "L I N Charles the Second ; great numbers of initials are carved rudely in the rock, with dates corresponding to the tradition. Near it is the Moor, called Harlai- Muir, probably from some skirmish there. In the Thirteenth Century, a Cha pelry was established at Inglis-Toun, in the South-West corner ofthe Parish, which was dedicated to The Virgin Mary. There was also of old a Chapel attached to an Hospital, near Spital-Haugh on Lyne water, at a place called from it Chapel Hill, and where stone coffins have been discovered. A Roman urn was found in a Cairn at Garwald-fooi, by the late General John Douglas. Linton gives the title of Baron to The Earl of Traquair. LINTON, or LINTON RODERICK, i. e. The Manor of Roderick near the Lake, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a380., three chalders of victual, and a glebe of nearly 8 Scotch acres: Patron, John Pringle, Esq., of Clinton : The Church is in good repair : the manse, and offices, are situate in the most agreeable and rural part ofthe Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Kelso, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 403, and in 1811, was 462. It is 6\\ m. S. S. E. from Kelso. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The surface is finely diversified, and the cli- mate is milder than in many ofthe adjacent districts ; the soil varies greatly ; on the banks of the Kail Water, which bounds it on the West, there is a fine Haugh of 300 acres, all inclosed, which has a deep rich clay soil, but is liable to be inundated : from this plain, the ground rises gradually, and the soil becomes a red sandy loam, exceedingly fertile : agriculture is well conducted, and great numbers of Sheep are bred here. Park, the residence of John Pringle, Esq., is an elegant Mansion, pleasantly situate to the Westward ofthe Church, in an extensive grove - and more than one half of the Parish belongs to this Gentle- man. Over one ofthe Church doors, a man on Horseback is carved in stone, killing, with a spear, a fierce animal, which, it is said, was the lastthaX. infested this district, when the woods were cut down ; this seeems to have been a deed of valour, as the memorial of it, we are told, is preserved on the Crest of Baron Somerville's arms, whose ancestors once possessed a large estate in this Par ish. In the centre of this District, five or six stones form a pretty large circle, called The Tryst: here, according to tradition, the parties that made incursions into Northumberland, used to meet ; but, when those who come first could not wait for the arrival of their companions, they cut with their swords upon tht Ss2"], [332, "L 1 S turf, the initials of their names ; the heads of the letters pointing to the place whither they were going, that their friends might follow them. LINTROSE, v. KETTINS. LINWOOD, in the Shire of Renfrew : and in the Parish of Killbarchan. It is 2j ra. W. N. W. from Paisley. A regidar Village, on an elegant plan, has been built here, to accommodate the persons employed in the extensive Cotton Manufactory, which has been established at this place. LISMORE, ISLAND, anciently KILL-MULUAG, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Cathedral, with the Parish of Appin united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 21 bolls 2 fir lots of barley, 52 bolls 2 firlots of oat-meal, at 9 stones per boll, and \u00a338.. 18.. 3. in money : the manse is in bad repair: the glebe consists of 4\u00a7* acres of arable, and about 6 acres of pasture land, mostly bog or marsh : Patron, The Duke of Argyle : The present Church consists of the Chancel ofthe old Cathedral. It is in the Presbytery of Lorn, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes,in 1801, was 3243, and, in 1811, was For the Parish of Appin - 2084. For the Parish of Lismore - 1323. 3407. It is 3 m. W. from Appin. The Island of Lismore is about 10 miles in length, and from half a mile to two miles in breadth. The surface is very rugged and uneven : but the soil is a rich fine loam, upon a lirae-stone rock, and is exceed ingly fertile. The climate is subject to heavy rains. The coast abounds with fish ; and there is also a great variety of game. The Salary of the Parochial School is from \u00a318. to \u00a320. Sterling, together with School-tees, and a good house. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. Fuel is expensive. The Roads are indifferent. According to tradition, this Island was originally a great Deer Forest ; and, as a proof, numbers of stags' horns of uncommon size are frequently dug up in the mosses. At present there is scarcely any wood ; but the lesser vegetables grow with uncommon vigour. Lismore was formerly a part of the Bishoprick of Argyle, the See having been disjoined from that of Dunkeld about the year 1200, at the request of John the Englishman, then Bishop ofthatDiocese, and the Seat ofthe new Bishoprick established here. The Font, and Confessional Chair, belonging to the old Cathedral, are still remaining. The ruinous Castle"], [333, "L I V of Achanduin, on the West side ofthe Isle, is supposed to have been latterly the residence ofthe Bishop. The old name ofthe Parish was Kill-Muluag, i. e. The Cell or Chapel of Muluag, a Saint of the Seventh Century, who was probably interred here ; and it is still so designed in the Teind records at Edinburgh. But the Island of Lismore forms only a small part of the prodigious extent of the United Parishes ; which stretches from the South-West end of Lismore to the extreme part of Kenloch-Beg, at the North-East in Appin, 63 miles in length, by 10, and, in some places, 16 miles in breadth. They are intersected by several considerable arms of the sea, and comprehend Lismore, Airds, the Strath of Appin, Duror, Glencoe, Glen-Crenan, and Kingerloch ; the last of which is of itself 9 computed miles in length, being situate on the North side of Linnhe Loch, an arm ofthe sea about 3 leagues across, which divides it from Lismore. The Missionary of Strontian preaches four times in the year at Kingerloch. The posterity ofthe Sextons hold a small piece of free land here, which is supposed to be among the oldest properties in the Parish, handed down regularly in a lineal succession : they held their charter originally from the Bishops, on the express condition that they were to preserve the baculum more. LISTON, v. KIRK-LISTON. LITTLE CLYDE, in the Shire of Lanark ; and in the Parish of Crawford. Here are the remains of a Roman Post, placed upon the Northern declivity of Erickstane-Brae ; and which, according to Mr. Chalmers, is obviously the long sought for Gadanica, the Town of the Damnii. The Minister of Crawford claims for his Parish, the honour of having three Roman Posts, within it ; but, he can only be allowed Gadanica, the other two strengths being merely the cir cular Hill Forts ofthe British people. LITTLE-DEAN, v. MAXTON. LITTLE FERRY, v. DORNOCH. LTTLE STRATH, v. LOCH BROOM. LIVINGSTON, in the Shire of Linlithgow : formerly a Vicarage, the Sti pend of which, in 1811, was 16 bolls of barley, 32 bolls of meal, and \u00a31060. Scotch in money, together with a glebe : Patron, Sir William Augustus Cunyng hame, Bart. : The Church, and manse, which are delightfully situate on a dry mount, in a curve ofthe river Aman, are both modern, and convenient. It is in the Presbytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Blackburn, and Livingston) was 551, and, in 1811, was 879. It is 3 m. S. W. from Mid"], [334, "L L A Calder. The Fair is on the first Friday in November. This Parish contains nearly 4000 acres of land, all arable, and inclosed. The soil is in general inclined to clay, with a tilly bottom ; and agriculture has been greatly improved of late, chiefly by the example and influence of Sir William Augustus Cunynghame, Bart., who is Proprietor of about two-thirds of the Parish, and of George MoNcrieff, Esq., of Blackburn. The Schoolmaster's salary, independent of his house, school, and other perquisites, is 300 merks ; besides 15 merks, which arise from an old mortification. The Peel of Livingston is said to derive its re- mote origin from a person ofthe name of Living, who flourished under the reign of David the First, and was undoubtedly a Baronial residence. The descendants of Living, having acquired the name of Livingston, became Peers, in the eleventh transmission ; Alexander, the seventh Baron, being created Earl of Linlithgow, in 1600; James, the fourth Earl, who, engaging in the Rebellion of 1715, lost his Estate and Honours, by attainder. Sir James Livingston, the second son of Alexander, the Earl of Linlithgow, was created Lord Almon, in 1633, and Earl of Calender, in 1641 ; but, after a few descents, these titles, by failure of issue, became merged, in 1695, with the elder title of Linlithgow. When in the possession ofthe Murrays (a branch ofthe Elibank family) a small rivulet that runs past the Castle, received the name ofthe Eliburn, which it still retains. About half a mile North-East from the Castle of Livingston, stands the Farm-house of New-year Field; where part of a square Tower remained, \u25a0until within these few years : Tradition says, that this was a Royal Hunting- Seat, frequented by the Kings of Scotland, when they resided at Linlithgow : and that a Spring adjoining, was a specific for the scrofula, when applied by the Royal hand upon a Neiv- Year's morning, before sun-rise; hence the name of Neic-year Field. Ofthe **' Bonny Lass of Livingston,\" so famed in Song ; it is said, that she kept a Public-House, at a place called Tlie High House of Livings- ton, about a mile West from the Church, \u2014 that she was esteemed handsome, and knew how to turn her charms to the best account. The Parish of Livings- ton was formerly of great extent : it comprehended the present Parishes of Li vingston, and Whiteburn ; the latter whereof, containing nearly two-thirds of the ancient Parish, was disjoined, and made a separate Parish, in 1730. See, Blackburn.

The whole of the Barony of Cockstown is now the pro perty of The Earl of Fife. LOAN-HEAD, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Denny. It is If m. S. from Denny. Here is a Meeting-House of the Seceders of the Anti burgher persuasion. LOCHABER, a District, in the Shire of Inverness. It is so called from a Lake not far from Inverness, and was the property of Bancho, Thane of Lochaber, and ancestor of the Royal House of Stewart. This is qne ofthe most dreary, mountainous, and barren Districts in Scotland. It is very thinly inhabited, and its chief produce is black cattle, and sheep. Upon one of the wildest mountains in this wild country, The Pretender erected his Standard in, the year 1745 ; who, immediately on his landing, engaged the deluded but highT minded Cameron, of Loch EU, in his pernicious enterprise.

It is situate upon the Northern shore of an arm of the sea to which it gives name, on the Atlantic Ocean. This is an extensive Parish: the general appearance is mountainous, and it is principally appropriated to pasturage. The climate is exceedingly moist and rainy, but not unhealthy. The fisheries are prosecuted here with great success : and a considerable quantity of kelp is ma nufactured annually. Game, of all kinds, are in great abundance.

This beautiful Lake is about 3 miles in length, and one mile in breadth, and abounds with pike, trout, and eels. It is the last of a chain of Lakes, through which the Forth passes, at a short distance from its source, and which contribute to form it into a river : at the lower extremity of this Lake, it bursts forth with great magnificence, over a rock nearly 30 feet high. In a very small Island in Loch Ard, are still the ruins of a Castle, which tradition reports to have been built by The Duke of Albany, uncle to James the First of Scotland : and it is said to have been intended for a retreat, almost inaccessible from its situation, when he was under apprehension of being prosecuted on account of his ambitious designs. LOCH ARKEGG, in the Shire of Inverness : and in the Parish of Kill- Malie. An excellent road has been made along the Northern side of this Lake, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners and Colonel Donald Cameron, of Loch EU; a distance of 22| miles, from Loch Nevish Head, by Glen Desserie, to Bon-Arkegg below Auchnacarie. At the Western extre mity ofthe Lake, is the Stage House of Arkegg. This road communicates with the Lochie Side road. It is a mountainous, and rugged district. LOCHAR MOSS, in the Shire of Dumfries. This is an extensive tract of moss, 12 miles in length by two or three miles in breadth, stretching down to the Solway Firth. It is divided into two parts by the Lochar Water, which winds through it.

It is an extensive Parish, stretching along the Atlantic Ocean, and is intersected by an arm of the sea to which it gives name. It consists princip ally of wild uncultivated mountains and hills, covered with moss, and heath ; but which afford pasturage to numerous herds of black cattle. The climate is very rainy. Here is a Parochial School , and also two of the Society's Schools ; one of which is at Ullapool, and the other at Little Strath. The Herring fishery is prosecuted here with great success. Mr. Mackenzie, of Dundonnel, is the only Resident Proprietor. LOCH BRUIACH, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Kill tarlaty. It is 8 m. S. S.W. from Beauly. This Lake is about a mile and a half long, aud nearly a mile broad, and in the middle of it is a small Island : it con tains four different kinds of black trout, and also abounds more than any other Lake in Scotland with the finest char.

At the Ferry-Town of Strom, are the remains of an old Castle, which formerly belonged to the Macdonells, of Glengary ; but of which they were dispossessed in one of their feuds by the family of Seaforth. Loch Carron has produced some good Gaelic poets, particularly the three Mackenzies ; some of whose poems are to be found in Macdonald's collection. An important line of Road is now making under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, from Kyle-Haken Ferry to Dingwall, by Loch Alsh, Jean Town, Luip, Auch nasheen, and Contin, a distance of nearly 60 miles.

A small stream of water passes from Mile-House through Lochee, which, on the South-side, forms a boundary to a portion ofthe Lands of Logie and Bal gay, as they extend there : on the South side of the stream, are very few houses comparatively, but they all come under the name of Lochee ; hence a few of the inhabitants belonging to Logie, Lochee may perhaps be said to be partly in the Parish of Dundee. A considerable manufacture of coarse linen is carried on here: it owed its rise chiefly to a family of the name of Cock, and their descendants with equal spirit and advantage pursue the same occupation. An office is now appointed in Lochee, at which a person, commissioned by the Stamp-Office in Dundee, attends once a Week, to inspect and stamp the webs manufactured for sale in these Parishes : and which has been found highly convenient and useful.

The United Parishes are about 30 miles in length, and from 6 to 20 miles in breadth ; exclu sive of a District belonging to them, on the Western side of Loch Fyne, which is 5 miles in length, and annexed, quoad sacra, to the Parish of Inverary. The surface is in general very rugged, and deeply intersected by three arms of the sea, viz., Loch Goil, Loch Long, and Loch Fyne. The soil, upon the coast, is light, sharp, and sandy ; and some of the low vallies are rich, and fertile ; but by far the greater part is mountainous, and appropriated to pasture. The rains are frequent, and heavy. In the mountains are many natural caves of great ex tent, which were used as places of concealment when predatory incursions ren dered the lives and property ofthe inhabitants insecure. Game, of various kinds, are in great plenty. Loch-Goil-Head being a much frequented Pass, especially in summer, between the West Highlands and the Low Country, is accommo dated with a good Inn. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. Fuel is ex pensive. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites, and a house, and garden. The ancient Castle of Carrick is situate upon a Rock, on the Western Coast of Loch Goil: it was burned by the Athol-men, nothing now remaining but the walls, and these are not entire : This was formerly a Royal Residence, and The Duke of Argyle is Hereditary Keeper of it. Ardgartan, the property of Campbell, of Strachur, is pleasantly situate on the banks of Loch Long, and surrounded with fine woods. Near this is a deep and wide Glen, called Glencroe, which forms one of the Passes into the Highlands. The Scenery of Glencroe is sublime in the highest degree ; and down the middle of it, runs a considerable brook, formed by a hundred little rills, which, being increased by the ruins with which the Glen is almost con stantly deluged, tumble in beautiful cascades from the steep and rugged moun tains on both sides. The length of this Glen is between four and five miles : the road ascends gently through the whole of it, except the last mile, where it is veny steep, and carried in a zig-zag form to the summit ofthe hill ; where there is a Seat, and a stone inscribed \" Rest and be Thankful,\" placed here by the Twenty- Second Regiment, who made the road. There are a few miserable cottages in Glencroe, inhabited by the Shepherds. By a Memorial presented to The"], [342, "LOC Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in the month of April 1805, by The Lord Provost, Magistrates, and Council of The City of Glasgow, The Magistrates and Council of The Town of Greenock, Sir Alexander Campbell, of Ardkinglass, Bart., and Archibald Campbell, of Drimsynie, Esq., it appears, \" That by the several roads which are now executing under your direction, a certain and easy communication will be opened from the Northern aad Western Highlands, and the coasts contiguous to the Western Highlands with Fort Wil liam, from whence there is a good road to Inverary. \u2014 But, it must also be of very great importance to open an easy and expeditious communication from Inver ary to the Clyde, as at present Travellers have no road by which they can get to Greenock from Inverary, except going round by Glasgow, a distance of Eighty-four miles, or travelling to Dumbarton, a distance of Forty-four miles, and hiring a Boat from that place ; besides being extremely difficult and often impos sible to procure horses, or any other means of conveyance, the usual resource of persons who can afford it, being to order Post-chaises from Glasgow, or Dum barton, which, besides the expense, occasions a delay of some days. \u2014 To remove these difficulties, the Memorialists beg leave to point out a very short communi cation between Inverary and the Clyde, that is, from Ardnoe on Loch Fyne through Hells Glen, to the Head of Loch- Goil, the distance being only six miles. And supposing the Traveller to start at Inverary, and to ferry over at St. Catherine's, the distance from St. Catherine's to Loch-Goil-Head, is not eight miles. \u2014 The advantages of this road are obvious ; Travellers may reach Loch-Goil-Head from Inverary in less than three hours. Foot-travellers are generally encumbered with heavy burdens, but by having a hired Cart at St. Catherine's, and another at Loch-Goil-Head, they will be enabled to propeed with ease and expedition.\u2014 This road will also be of great advan tage to the Herring Fishery on Loch Fyne, as well as to the great and populous Towns on the river and Firth of Clyde, by procuring a speedy con veyance for fresh Herrings from Loch Fyne to Glasgow, Paisley, Greenock, and all that neighbourhood ; and, from time immemorial, Herrings have been carried from Loch-Fyne to Loch-Goil-Head, and from thence carried fresh in boats to Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock. \u2014 Hitherto, owing to the want of a good road, the Herrings have been carried on Horseback, in creels or baskets, and in that way a horse could not carry more than five or six Hundred at once ; but, on a good road, and in a cart, it is well known that a horse can draw a load of many"], [343, "LOC Thousand Herrings at a time ; besides, after arriving at Loch-Goil-Head, should contrary winds prevent boats from proceeding to the Clyde, the Herrings can easily be conveyed to Portincaple, and from thence carried in carts into the inland Counties of Dumbarton, Perth, and Stirling.\" \u2014 This short road (6^ miles) was, in consequence, completed in terms of the Act ; it has now been extremely useful to the Public for some years, and has been kept in repair by the Statute labour of the District. See, Killmorich. In the month of February 1808, The Commissioners received a Memorial from The Road Com mittee ofthe Shire of Argyle, offering to contribute a moiety towards a proposed improvement ofthe road between the Head of Loch Long and the Head of Loch Fyne (15 miles by measurement), over the Mountain between Glencroe and Glen-Kinglass. The road now in use having been made as a Military road at the expense ofthe Public, The Commissioners did not think themselves author ized to entertain a proposal for a mere improvement, the expense of which was estimated at nearly Seven Thousand Pounds ; and so they informed the Memorialists.

At the distance of four miles from the Parish Church, near the confluence ofthe river Tars with the North Esk, a new Chapel belonging to the Scotch Episcopalians, was built in 1810: it is neat, and commodious, but very indifferently seated. It is in the Presbytery of Brechin, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 541, and, in 1811, was 521. It is 20 m. N. W. from Brechin. The inhabited part ofthe Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth ; but the pasture, and waste lands, make it 12 miles long, and 6 miles broad. It is surrounded by the Grampian Mountains on all sides, except at the East end, through which the river North Esk directs its course. The hills are for the most part steep, rocky, and covered with heath ; even the vallies are covered with heath, except the cultivated land, the extent of which is inconsiderable : and the soil is thin and light, generally on a bottom of gravel, intermixed with stones. About 10,000 sheep are fed upon the hills, and nearly 200 black cattle are annually reared in the Parish. The climate is late, and the crops are often injured by the severity ofthe weather: but it is not unhealthy. The Honourable William Maule, of Panmure, is Proprietor ofthe Parish. It is watered by the rivers Lee, Mark Branny, and Tars; the three former of which unite opposite to the New Church, and constitute the North Esk. The Lee, passing through Loch Lee, gives name to the Parish ; this Loch is about a mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad, and abounds with trout, eels, and char. The Roads, and Bridges, are in toler able repair. As the mosses in the low grounds are nearly exhausted, fuel will be obtained with greater difficulty and labour, in a few years hence ; the hills, although in many places covered with deep moss, being, at present, inaccessible.

The present worthy Minister, The Rev. David Inglis, most obligingly adds, \" The rocks abound with lime-stone ; and a vein of lead ore, containing a sixty-third part of silver, has been traced for several miles, in a direction from East to West, but it has not been found adequate to the expense of working. The hills abound with game, and a few ptarmagans frequent Mount- Keen, and Mount- Battock, the summits of which are elevated between two and three thousand feet above the level of the sea. The rents are paid foreh and ; that is to say, the rent for the crop of 1812 is paid, the first half at Whitsunday 1811, and the last half at Martinmas ofthe same year. Services of all kinds are abolished, except that each Tenant is to furnish a man and horse for two days in the year, to attend the Proprietor, if desired ; and, in proportion to their rents, to carry materials for building and repairing the Church, manse, school, and public edifices in the Parish. Agriculture is now more attended to than for merly ; and the crops are oats, Chester bear or big, with a few pease, potatoes, and turnips.\" The Castle of Inver-Mark was the ancient residence ofthe family of Lindsay.

An excellent road has been made, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, and Colonel Donald Cameron, of Loch EU : a distance of 18| miles nearly, from Clunes to the head ofthe Lake ; and also from Corpach Moss, near Kill-Malie, by the West side of the river Lochy to Clunes, and a branch from thence towards Loch Arkegg, a distance of 12^ miles. A Ferry boat over the river Lochy, near Fort Wil liam, has likewise been established, similar to that which is in use upon the river Clyde at Renfrew, and affords at all times a safe and speedy passage to travellers. A Quarry of suitable stone has been discovered in a convenient situation on its Northern shore, which is applied for the construction ofthe Lock and Bridge over the river Lochy. The Soundings in this Lake are from 7 to 68 fathoms, with bold shores and good anchorage. LOCH LOITTER, v. MEIKLY. LOCH LOMOND, in the Shire of Dumbarton.

In it are several Islands, finely wooded ; and the variety and grandeur of its scenery are highly and deservedly extolled. Its surface has for several years past been observed gradually to increase and invade the adjacent shore : and there is reason to suppose that Churches, houses, and other buildings have been lost in the water. At the time of the remarkable Earthquake at Lisbon, in 1755, the water of Loch Lomond was affected in a very surprising manner : when the agitation subsided, a boat was found on the dry land, at the distance of more than forty yards from its station on the lake ; and, where the banks were low, the country was overflowed to a considerable extent.

It is in the Presbytery of Lochmaben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2053, and, in 1811, was 2392. It is 65 m. S. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The Fairs are holden on the last Tuesdays O. S., in January, April, July, and October. This Royal Burgh is of very an cient erection, being said to have received its Charter from King Robert Bruce, whose paternal estate was the great Lordship of Annandale : and it is certain, that that Monarch presented the Borough with lands from his own possessions. The oldest Charter is a writ of novodamus granted by James the Sixth, on the 16th of July 1612; giving, as a reason for the renewal, the inroads ofthe Eng lish, who had plundered and burnt the Town, and destroyed its Records. It is governed by a Provost, 3 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, Treasurer, and 9 Common Council-men : and unites with Annan, Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Sanquhar, in sending one Member to Parliament. The Borough Roods, and Town Com- Uu2"], [348, "LOC monty, are very extensive. A considerable manufacture of coarse linen is car- ried on here. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with the Interest on \u00a3200., bequeathed by the late James Richardson, of Reading ; and for which the master is to teach 10 poor Scholars of this Parish, English, Latin, writing, and arithmetic, gratis ; the same benevolent Gentleman also left \u00a3100., for supporting a Library, and keeping in repair a good house, built by him, for the use of the School-master, and for preserving, supplying, and continuing the said Library : and he further left \u00a3100., the Interest of which is to be applied lo a School in Hightae, for the benefit ofthe whole Four Towns. Close to the Town, is the site of a very ancient Castle, which was originally the Seat of Robert Bbuce, Lord of Annandale, before that Family came to the Crown of Scotland : and here, it is said, that Robert the First was born. The ground upon which it stood, now belongs to Robert Maxwell, Esq. , whose pre- decessors have been in possession of it upwards of 200 years ; their ancestor David Maxwell having been then appointed Sub-Governor of this Castle, by Lord Maxwell, Warden of the Western borders, and Keeper of the same : And Mr. Maxwell, the present worthy Provost, and his predecessors, have been often and long the chief Magistrates ofthe Town. \u2014 The Parish of Lochmaben is about 10 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, extending along the banks of the Annan. The soil is exceedingly rich, especially on the banks ofthe rivers ; and great improvements have lately been made in the moor lands, by the \"assistance of lime. Peat is the fuel mostly used, but the mosses are wearing out : coals are brought from England, at the distance of 30 or 40 miles. There is a fine salmon fishery on the Annan, which belongs principally to this Parish, The Roads are in good repair. There are seven or eight Lochs in the Parish. but the Castle Loch is the largest: this is a beautiful sheet of water, lyiu\u00b0- South of the Town, being a mile and a half in length, and a mile in breadth, and abounding with a variety of fish : among which there is one species that seems to be peculiar to this Lake ; it greatly resembles a small herring, both in appearance and flavour, but is esteemed more delicate, and is called Vendace or Vendise. Upon a Peninsula of this Loch stands the Castle which is by far the largest and strongest of any on the Border, next to Carlisle against which it was a frontier garrison. ThisCastlewasalsobuiltbyKingRoBERT Bruce, and before the Unionofthe Crowns, a garrison of 200 men was constantly kept in it. The Governor had a Salary of \u00a3300. Scotch, together with the fishing of the Lochs. The Earl of Hopetoun is Keeper of this Fortress : for, among the titles of"], [349, "LOC The Marquis of Annandale, he assumes that of Constable, or Hereditary Keeper of the Castle of Lochmaben. But the great estate of Murray Earl of Annandale, of which the Castle and Barony of Lochmaben are a part, having gone, by succes- sion, to Murray Viscount Stormont, Earl of Mansfield in England, his Lordship likewise claims the title of Hereditary Keeper, and Constable of this Castle. It has long been in ruins, and is surrounded by a large uncultivated tract of land, called The Castle Mains: in former times there was a deer park, and a very extensive oak forest. Both of these castles, and this part of the country in general, were the scenes of various military exploits, and of some of the heroic actions of the renowned Sir William Wallace, of Ellerslie. Contiguous to The Castle Mains is the Barony of Lochmaben, or, as it is more commonly called, The Four Towns, (from the circumstance of the district comprehending four populous Villages), a very large tract of fertile land, on the banks ofthe Annan. The Tenants are commonly called, The King's kindly Tenants. The original pos- sessors were the garrison of the Castle, to whom the lands were granted for their attendance on the duties of the garrison, or, according to the opinion of others, the domestic servants of the Castle. The Tenants hold by Udal tenure, that is, with- out charter or seisin, the property being transferred by delivery and possession only : a species of tenure, which obtains also in the Crown lands in the Orkney and Shetland Islands. The tenants pay a small rent to The Earl of Mansfield, as Viscount Stormont : aud the transfer of property requires only to be inserted in His Lordship's rental (which is done without expense), to render the transac- tion valid. The right ofthe Tenants was renewed by James the Sixth, and Charles the Second ; it was also confirmed by The Court of Session, and by a decree of The British House of Peers, on the 28th of December 1726, and the 14th of January 1727. Their possessions and valuations are distinguished by acres : in which there is a peculiarity, as the Ell by which their acres have been measured, called Tlie Barony Ell, contains 42 inches, whereas the common Ell, that is used in the country, is only 38. Contiguous to The Four Towns, there was an extensive Commonty, in which they had an interest : it was divided some years ago, and they had a large share of it. Their several proportions are mostly now improved, and are of higher value than their original property acres. On many of their shares small Farm-houses have been erected, which have con- siderably increased the number of Inhabitants of the Parish. The prevailing names in this District are, Richardson, Rae, Kennedy, Nicholson, and Wright, but the Richardsons are by far the most numerous : And some of"], [350, "LOC these names are to be found among the companions of Wallace and Bruce, in his wars for the recovery of his ancient inheritance of the Kingdom of Scotland. Spedlin's Castle is situate about three miles to the Northward of Lochmaben, on the Western bank of the river Annan: it has long been, as it is at present, the property of an ancient and respectable family, the Jardines, of Applegarth : who have a handsome modern seat, and plantation, on the opposite side ofthe river.

LOCH-NA-GAUL, an Inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, upon the Western Coast of Inverness. In the year 1796, Mr. Brown, Road Engineer, by orders from the then Commander in Chief, in Scotland, surveyed a line of road to lead from the Ferry ofthe river Lochy near Fort William, up Loch Eil, to Loch-na- Gaul, on the confines of the Counties of Inverness and Argyle, extending to 37| miles : which road was first undertaken by the Trustees for the Estate of Macdonald, of Clanranald, and a great part executed solely at his expense. By the Report of Mr. Telford to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, on the 16th of December 1803, it appears, that \" the general importance of this road has been fully stated by The Highland Society, and also in his Report made to The Lords ofthe Treasury in 1802. It opens a commu nication from Glasgow, Greenock, and Oban, by Fort William, to The Islands and Fishing grounds to the South of Skye. The termination of the road on Loch-na-Gaul, being nearly opposite to the point of Sleat in Skye, it will afford an opportunity of establishing a Ferry there, and Clanranald has already built a very excellent Inn at Arasaig, with that view upon the shore of Loch-na- Gaul ; and the Post-master General, satisfied ofthe utility of this Station to the Public, has already established a Post-Office there. The advantages which the"], [351, "LOC extensive tract of country lying between Loch-na-Gaul and Fort William will derive from this road, are many and evident. It will open a direct communica tion with the Military road at Fort William, which connects with the East and West coasts also to the Southward ; and the usual intercourse of the country also, with black cattle and sheep, will be along this road from various parts of the country. A branch may readily be carried from this road at Loch-na- Gaul to Loch Mor'ar, which will probably lead to a further extension to Loch Nevish, by which that part ofthe coast will be completely opened, and it may, in time, connect with the Glen-Garry road at Loch- Hourn .\" \u2014 LOCH-NAN-KELL, or LOCH-NAN-GAUL, v.

From the Survey and Report of The Coasts and Central Highlands of Scotland made by the Command of The Right Honourable The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, in the Autumn of 1802, by Thomas Telford, Esq., Civil Engineer, it appears, \" that Loch Ness is 22 miles in length, and from one to two and a half miles in breadth ; that its extreme depth is 135 fathoms, and generally 15 to 20 very near the Shores ; that there are six anchoring places on the North, and four on the South side, and that at each end of the Loch there is good anchorage in from 3 to 5, 8 and 10 fathom's water. \u2014 That a vessel passing from the West to the East end before a Westerly wind, or in a contrary direction before an Easterly wind, has nothing to do but run before the wind the whole way, which she would do in from three to five hours, and with contrary winds in moderate weather she would work it in from 24 to 36 hours. \u2014 That the Easterly winds generally prevail from March till the end of September, when the Westerly winds set in and continue for the rest of the year.\" The surrounding scenery is remarkably grand. Its water is extremely clear and pleasant, and is imagined by the natives to be me dicinal. It never freezes in the severest winter. At the time of the great earth-"], [352, "LOC quake at Lisbon, in 1755, this lake was agitated in an extraordinary manner. It now constitutes a prominent feature in the line of The Caledonian Canal.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 514, and, in 1811, was 563. It is 5 m. W. S. W. from Dumfries. This Parish contains about 7000 acres. The extremities are hilly ; but the remainder lies in a valley of arable land, which is interspersed with eminences, mosses, and meadows. The soil is in general a light shallow loam, on a gravelly bottom ; and is neither very barren, nor very fertile. The climate is cold, but not unhealthy. The Lake or Loch, from which the Parish derives its name, is a mile in length, and about half a mile in breadth : it abounds with pike, perch, and eels ; and in the centre, is a small Island, which is much frequented by sea-gulls, during the season of incubation. Here is a Chalybeate spring, called Merkland Well, which is in considerable repute in stomachic complaints. Peats are the common fuel. The great Military Road, from Dum fries to Port-Patrick, runs the whole length of the Parish. Upon a Hill at the Eastern extremity, are the vestiges of a Druidical temple, commonly called The Seven Grey Stones; though, in fact, there are nine upright stones, surrounding an eminence, and forming a circle of about 170 feet in diameter. Adjacent to the Lake, is The Castle of Loch-Rutton, or The Hills Castle. The pre sent building, from its style, does not seem older than the middle of the Six teenth century ; and, indeed, from the dates of 1598 and 1600 over the Gate and Inner Court, it is most likely that some re-edification, or great repair^ took place at those times. From the Wardrobe Account of the year 1300, published by The Society of Antiquaries of London, it appears, that there was at that time a Castle, or Mansion, of sufficient size and consequence to receive King Edward the First, who remained here one night, in his way from the Castle of Caerlaverock to Kirkcudbright, and in his Chapel here offered up his Oblations ; the words ofthe Original are, \" 17 die Julii in Obac' Regis ad Altare in Capella sua amid Loghroielon, 7s.\" This Fortalice was afterwards one of the strong holds, which were possessed by the Douglas family, when Lords of Galloway ; and, upon the ruin of that House, it was granted to the Herries family, from whom it came to the Lords Maxwell, and devolved to a Cadet of that House, thence denominated Maxwell, of The Hills, according to a copy of an ancient Pedigree of the Nithsdale Family, preserved at Friars' Carse. Mr. Grose has given a view of this Castle. vol. ii. X x"], [354, "LOC LOCH RYAN, in the District of The Rhyns, and Shire of Wigtown. This is a considerable Bay, which extends in a South-East direction from the Atlantic Ocean ; forming by its approximation to the Bay of Luce, that Peninsula which is called The Rinns or Rhyns of Galloway. It extends about 10 miles in length, and is about two miles broad at its entrance, and continues ofthe same breadth for about three miles ; it then spreads out very beautifully into a circular figure, about four miles in breadth. The whole Bay affords excellent anchorage, par ticularly opposite to the Village of Cairn, in Portmore Bay, The Wig, the Bay of Soleburn, the Bay of ' Dalmennock, and the Harbour of Stranraer. Loch Ryan, according to General Roy, is undoubtedly the Rerigonus Sinus of Ptolomey, and Richard of Cirencester, near which they place the Rerigonum Urbs. The situ ation in Richard's map leads to Loch Ryan House, which stands on the East side of the Loch, about the middle of it, where it is narrowest. Either her'e, then, or at Stranraer, which is situate at the bottom of the Bay, according as ves tiges or coins (if either are discovered) may seem best to authorize, the city of Rerigonum may be fixed.

It is situate at the Southern extremity of Lewis, and is separated from Harris by Loch Seaforth, on the East, and Loch Resort, on the West, and an intervening ridge of lofty mountains. This is an extensive Parish, intersected by numerous arms of the sea, which afford excellent anchorage for vessels of considerable burden, espe cially Loch Resort, and Loch Shell, at the entrance of each of which is an Island, that render them secure retreats for vessels at all seasons. The coast is bold and rocky; but the interior is more level, and agriculture has been much im proved here of late. The air is very moist, but not unhealthy. Fish of various kinds are abundant, but cod and ling constitute the principal fishery. The Gaelic language is their mother tongue. Peats are the common fuel. Lord Seaforth is sole heritor ofthe Parish. Here is both a Parochial, and a Society's School.

This Parish extends about 6 miles square; of which, 5476 acres are arable, and are all inclosed, and well culti vated: Tlie Misty Laic , a remarkable hill, which is elevated about 1240 feet above the level of the sea, is surrounded by the muirland part, and abounds with game. The Loch of Castle Semple, is a beautiful piece of water, covering up wards of 400 acres : it is well stocked with pike, perch, and eels, and is much frequented by various kinds of aquatic birds. The Loch of Queenside, which is situate in the muirs, contains about 21 acres, and forms an excellent reservoir, for supplying two large cotton mills erected in the village. The climate is rainy. The roads are good. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites : besides which, there is a School in the South ern district, with a Salary of 50 merks, a School-house, and emoluments amount ing in the whole to about \u00a317. Sterling. Coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, are in great plenty : and a remarkable magnetic rock has been discovered, by which the compass is strongly attracted, at the distance of 150 yards. In 1739, a print was taken by J. Cooper, of Margaret Patton, a native of this Parish, and then resident in the Work-house of St. Margaret's Westminster, \" aged 138 years.\" Mr. Macdowall is proprietor of a considerable part ofthe Parish, and the re mainder holds of him as Superior, with a few exceptions : the other proprietors are numerous, and seem to have arisen from the feus granted by the Noble fami lies of Dundonald and Semple, who were formerly proprietors of the greater part of this Parish. The old Chapel or College of Castle Semple, which was founded by John, first Lord Semple, for a Provost, and three Prebendaries, in the year 1505, is still entire : it is beautifully covered with ivy, and is used as a burying-place. On an Island in the Lake, is an old Castle, which appears to have been formerly of considerable strength, and to which the Lairds of Semple are said to have retreated in feudal times, when unable to hold out in the Castle of Semple against their more powerful enemies.

This Town, so called from having been a place or Tower of safety on the English Border, is situate"], [357, "LOC between and almost Surrounded by two Lochs, or Lakes, now drained ; the one, on the East side of the intervening ridge, is converted into a rich bog meadow, in the bottom of which is a deep bed of shell marl ; the other, on the West side, is partly meadow and partly moss, lying also on marl, very deep. The Town consists of one long Street, from North to South, in extent about half a mile, and another, at a right angle to the East of about a quarter of a mile : and, in 1793, it contained 700 Inhabitants, but since that time it has been greatly en larged. At the head or North end ofthe Town, stands the Parish Church upon an eminence : it is a neat edifice, handsomely fitted up in the inside, and may contain about 750 persons : It was built in the year 1757, being at that time re moved from Dryfe-side, about a mile and a half North from Lockerbie ; it is said, that, in the year 1670, the river Dryfe swept away the original Church and Burying-ground, which were in the middle of the Holm, now called The Sand Bed ; after this, in 1671, the late Church and Burial ground were estab lished at a small distance, and upon the Skirts of the present glebe or Kirk-hill, then thought to be perfectly secure from the swells of the river Dryfe ; but the water in process of .time, approaching the new burying-ground, carried a good deal of it away, and threatened the Church itself, verifying the Prophecy of Rymer, u Let spades and shoels do what they may, \" Dryfe will have Dry' s-dale Kirk away.\" Partly from the above circumstances, but principally through the influence ofthe Family of Lockerbie, the Church was removed to the Town, for the ornament and convenience of the place and parish.

The Church is 5 miles North from Montrose, and 5 miles N. E. from Brechin. The United Parishes contain 3860 acres ; of which 1850 are cultivated, and 770 are under wood : the soil, on the banks of the river, is a deep clay : on the higher grounds, it is partly a light loam, and partly of a black moorish cast, on a cold till bottom. The air is sharp and salubrious. The North Esk, commonly called, Tlie North Water, is the only river ; it divides the Shires of Forfar, and Kincardine, and the Parishes of Logie, Pert, and Mary-Kirk ; and gives the title of Earl to the Noble Family of Car negie, Earl of Northesk, who formerly possessed a large tract of land in the Parish of Pert, and its neighbourhood, on both sides of the river, and which now belongs to The Earl of Kintore, and others : Rose Hill, in the Parish of Mary- Kirk, which gives the title of Baron to the Eldest son of The Earl of Northesk, is an eminence on the road side, near the gate of Inglismaldie, a Seat belong ing to The Earl of Kintore, and a little to the Northward ofthe North Water Bridge. William, the present and Seventh Earl of Northesk, is a Vice-Ad miral ofthe Blue, and Knight ofthe Bath, which Honour, and certain honour able augmentations to his Armorial Ensigns, and the ancient Supporters ofthe Earldom, were conferred upon him in consequence of his distinguished conduct, as third in Command, at the glorious and decisive victory off Cape Trafalgar. The river South Esk, which runs past the Town of Brechin, gave the title of Earl to the Family of Carnegie, attainted in 1715. On the Hill of Pert, are extensive Quarries of lime-stone, of an excellent quality. Here are two Bleach fields, and two flax spinning mills. A new bridge is erecting on the North Esk, nearly opposite to the Village of Mary-Kirk. Coals are the principal fuel. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a322.. 4.. 0., and perquisites, together with a free house, and garden.

The House of Balgay is modern and elegant, and the situation is beautiful and picturesque. The old House of Blackness stands within a small inclosure, edged with trees : and from thence to Dundee the whole space is co vered with Kitchen Gardens, and Nursery ground, let at \u00a312. per acre. The House of Logie, situate upon an eminence, and nearly surrounded with old and lofty trees, has been much improved and enlarged by the present Proprietor. See, Lochee.

This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and nearly as much in breadth, lying along the banks of the Forth .' one half of the Parish is a strong carse soil, producing most luxuriant crops, the other half being dryfield, and hilly, which affords excellent pasture. Provisions of all kinds are plentiful. Coals are within the distance of four miles ; as are also peats in great abundance, in Moss Flanders. Poor's Rates are adopted in this Parish ; one half of which are paid by the Heritors, and the other by the Tenants : the Poor live in their own houses, and none are allowed to beg. On a Peninsula, formed by the windings of the Forth, stands the ruinous Abbey of C ambus-Kenneth ; it was founded by David the First, King of Scotland, for Canons Regular ofthe Order of St. Augustine, in 1147; and here King James the Third, and his"], [361, "LOG Queen, were buried. This Abbey was once an extensive building, and the richest in Scotland : several Parliaments were holden in it, and here the Clergy, Earls, and Barons, in 1326, with a great number of an Inferior Rank, swore fealty to David Bruce : and, at the same time, here was solemnized the marriage be- tween Andrew Murray, of Bothwell, and Christian Bruce, Sister to King Robert : Many of the Abbots of this House were men of eminence in Politics, as well as in Literature. After the Accession of James the Sixth to the Crown of England, the Temporality of Cambus-Kenneth, together with that of Dry- burgh and the Priory of Inch Mahome, were conferred on John Earl of Mark, son to the Regent, that he might be in a better condition to provide for his youngest sons, whom he had by Mary Stuart, daughter of The Duke of Len- nox, and a relation to His Majesty. The Barony of Cambus-Kenneth, in which the Abbey was situate, was settled by The Earl on Alexander Erskine, one of his sons, who dying without issue, it came to Charles Erskine, of Aha, his brother, whose posterity continued in the possession of it till about the year 1737, when it was purchased by the Town-Council of Stirling, for the benefit of Cowan's Hospital, to which it still belongs : Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. It is, however, remarkable that the small Village, called The Abbey, which occupies the place where this celebrated Abbey once stood, has hitherto, along with the Barony of Cambus-Kenneth, in which it is situate, been reckoned part ofthe Parish of Stirling. What gave rise to this arrangement is not known, unless it was, that the Servants belonging to the Abbey worshipped in Stirling, or that the Canons, Monks, or Friars of that Monastery, performed Divine Ser- vice in the Church of Stirling, and formed a kind of connection wrhich continued to subsist after the Reformation: that such a connection must have subsisted, is certain ; for there is actually a Seat in the Church of Stirling, allotted for the Inhabitants of that Village ; and it appears, that an Elder from it has sat in the Session of Stirling, almost uniformly since the year 1559. The Barony of Cam bus-Kenneth pays a part of the Stipend of the First Minister of Stirling ; but it is subject to Poor's Rates in the Parish of Logie, and to the Jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Clackmannan. The Commissary of Stirling also exercises his Juris diction over it, as a part ofthe Parish of Stirling ; and the Commissary of Dun blane exercises his Jurisdiction, as lying within the Parish of Logie. Near to the Abbey, is a rock of considerable height, called The Abbey Craig; on the summit of which are the remains of a battery, said to have been erected in the time of Oliver Cromwell, when he laid siege to the Castle of Stirling.

From the top of the hill of Dunmyatt, which rises in a conical shape from the plain, part of twelve Counties may be seen ; and this beautiful and varied scenery is thus described by Mr. Macneil, in his Poem ofthe \" Links o' Forth.\" \"0! grander far than Windsor's brow ! \" And sweeter, too, the vale below ! \" Whar Forth' s unrivall'd windings flow \" Through varied grain, \" Bright'ning, I ween, wi' glittering glow \" Strevlina's plain. **\u2022* There, raptur'd trace (enthron'd on hie), \" The landscape stretching on the ee, \" Frae Grampians heights, down to the sea \" (A dazzling view), \" Corn, meadow, mansion, water, tree, \" In varying hue.\" At Manor, is a small creek on the Forth, which is within the Jurisdiction ofthe Port of Alloa ; and it would seem, that this part of the river had been frequented by the Romans, as a passage from the South to the North ; for there are vestiges of a Roman causeway, running into the river at Manor, and it is only within these, few years, that the remains of a small castellum, for protecting the passage, have been destroyed. LOG1E-ALMOND, commonly called THE NEW PARISH, in the Shire of Perth: this District has lately been disjoined from the Parishes of Foulis Wester, and Monzie, and annexed, quoad sacra, to the Parish of Monedie. It is situate upon the Northern bank of the river Almond, and is about three miles square, containing between seven and eight hundred Inhabitants. The soil ad jacent to the river, is partly a light loam, and partly gravelly : but, on the rising ground, it becomes a deep till, mixed with moss. The hills are divided into sheep walks ; and abound with all kinds of game. The climate is sharp, and subject to frequent rains : but it is not unhealthy. Here is an ancient Tliorn, which is holden in superstitious veneration. All the ancient Servitudes are con verted into money. William Drummond, Esq., is the only Proprietor. LOGIE-BRIDE, in the Shire of Perth: an ancient Parish, now annexed to"], [363, "LOG the Parish of Auchtergaven : the glebe consists of 4f acres : The Inhabitants of the district that belonged to this Parish, continue to bury in this Church-yard ; and a part ofthe Church is yet standing, which is used as a burying-place by the Robertsons, of Tullybelton. It is 2 miles distant from Auchtergaven. Above 70 years ago, the Ministers of Auchtergaven preached occasionally at Logie- Bride, but none of the Parishioners remember any Minister residing there. Robert Robertson, Esq., of Tullybelton, is a principal Heritor. LOGIE-BUCHAN, in the District of Ellon, and Shire of Aberdeen : for merly a Rectory, and Vicarage, belonging to the Chapter of Aberdeen ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of victual, one half payable in meal, and the other half in bear, and \u00a324.. 8.. 0. Sterling: the manse was built in 1775 : the glebe consists of 5 acres : Patron, Mr. Buchan, of Auchmacoy: The Church was built in 1787. It is in the Presbytery of Ellon, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 539, and, in 1811, was 580. It is 2\\ m. E. S. E. from Ellon. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, aud from 1^ to 2 miles in breadth, being intersected by the river Ythan, which is navigable for small vessels for about three miles. The surface is pretty flat, with some rising grounds, all of which are capable of cultivation : and the soil is in general fertile, except on the banks of the river, where it is barren, rocky, and covered with heath. The pearl fishery in the river Ythan, was formerly considered an object of great value, as it appears that one ofthe pre decessors of Mr. Buchan, of Auchmacoy, had obtained a Patent for it ; and in the List of unprinted Acts ofthe first Parliament of Charles the First, in 1633, there is an Act \" repealing the Patent for the Pearl Fishery, granted to Robert Buchan.\" The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, anda rood of land. Peat-moss is scarce, but coals are easily procured. Auchmacoy is the residence of Mr. Buchan, one ofthe principal Heritors. LOGIE-COLDSTONE, v. COLDSTONE. LOGIE-DURNO, v. GARIOCH.

Sterling, and a right to the small tythes in kind: the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of 26 acres : Patron, The Hon. Mrs. Mackenzie : The Church is particularly neat. It is in the Presbytery of Tain, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 180L Yy2"], [364, "LOG was 1031, and, in 1811, was 928. It is 4 m. S. b. W. from Tain. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The soil varies from a deep strong clay to a light loam ; and agriculture is greatly improved here of late. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. Peats, turf, and brushwood, are the general fuel : though coals are now introduced. LOGIE-RAIT, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. ; the manse was built in 1756 : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent: Patron, The Duke of Athol : The Church is in to lerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2890, and, in 1811, was 3001. It is 8 m. N. N. W. from Dunkeld. This Parish is of an irre gular triangular shape, lying either between the rivers Tummel and Tay, or upon the North side of the Tummel: the distance between those rivers is about 7 miles : but a detached part of the Parish stretches about a mile South from the Tay, on the road to Taymouth ; and another division of it is situate in Rannoch, at the distance of 30 miles. Ofthe whole extent, about 3000 acres are arable, and nearly 1000 acres are covered with wood : the hills are covered with heath, and afford excellent sheep pasture. The air is dry, and healthful. The staple arti cle of manufacture, and export, is linen yarn. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, to which are added 100 merks per annum, given by the Trustees for managing the rents ofthe Bishoprick of Dunkeld. The language spoken here, is a corrupted dialect of the Gaelic. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. About half a mile from the village, upon a high bank, near the Ferry of Tummel, are the ruins of an old fortified Castle, which is said to have been the residence of Robert the Second, aster he gave up the administration of the government to his Brother, The Duke of Albany. The name ofthe Parish is compounded ofthe two Gaelic words, Logan, a hollow place, and Reite, the ending of strife ; which it seems to have received from its low situation, and from its having been the Seat ofthe Regal ity Court of Athol : His Grace the Duke of Athol being still the Superior, and principal heritor. Various Services are exacted from the tenants. Dr. Adam Ferguson, so respectable for his learning and eloquence, was a native of this Parish. Many superstitious Customs are retained here : \u2014 Lucky and unlucky days are by many persons anxiously observed : that day of the week upon which the 14th oi May Happens to fail, is esteemed unlucky through all the remainder"], [365, "LOG ofthe year ; none marry, or begin any serious business upon it : None chuse to marry in January or May ; or to have their Banns proclaimed in the end of one Quarter ofthe year, and to m?.rry in the beginning of the next : Some things are to be done before the full Moon ; others after : In fevers, the illness is expected to be more severe on Sunday, than on the other days of the week ; if easier on Sun day, a relapse is feared : \u2014 Immediately before the celebration of the marriage ceremony, every knot about the Bride and Bridegroom (garters, shoe-strings, strings of pettycoats, &c.) is carefully loosened : After leaving the Church, the whole company walk round it, keeping the Church always upon the right hand: The Bridegroom, however, first retires one way with some young men, to tie the knots that were loosed about him; while the young married woman, in the same manner, retires somewhere else to adjust the disorder of her dress : \u2014 When a child was baptised privately, it was not long since customary, to place the child upon a clean basket, having a cloth previously spread over it, with bread and cheese put into the cloth ; and thus to move the basket three times successively round the iron crook, which hangs over the fire, from the roof of the house, for the purpose of supporting the pots on culinary occasions : this was probably in tended to counteract the malignant arts, which witches and evil spirits were imagined to practise against new born infants : \u2014 Recourse is often had to charms, for the cure of diseases of horses and cows, no less than in the human species : In the case of various diseases, a pilgrimage is performed to a place, called Strath- Fillan, 40 miles distant from Logie-Rait ; where the patient bathes in a certain pool, and performs some other rites in a Chapel which stands near it: It is, however, chiefly in the case of madness, that the Pilgrimage to Strath-Fil lan is believed to be salutary : The unfortunate person is first bathed in the pool, then left for a night bound in the chapel, and if found loose in the morning, is expected to recover : \u2014 There is a disease, called Glacach by the Highlanders, which, as it affects the chest and lungs, is evidently of a consumptive nature : It is also called, \" The Macdonald 's Disease ,'' because there are particular tribes of Macdonalds, who are believed to cure it with the charms of their touch, and the use of a certain set of words : no fee of any kind must be given . and their faith in being so touched by a Macdonald, is implicit : \u2014 On the 1st of May, O. S., a festival, called Beil- Tain, is annually holden here : It is chiefly celebrated by the Cow-herds, who assemble by scores in the fields, to dress a dinner for them selves, of boiled milk and eggs : these dishes they eat with a sort of cakes baked for the occasion, and having small conical lumps raised all over the surface ;\u2014"], [366, "LON On the evening of the 31st of October, O. S., among many others, one remark- able ceremony is observed : heath, broom, and dressings of flax, are tied upon a pole : this faggot is then kindled ; a person takes it upon his shoulder, and run ning, carries it round the village ; a crowd attend ; when the first faggot is con sumed, a second is bound to the pole, and kindled in the same manner as before : Numbers of these blazing faggots are often carried about together, and when the night happens to be dark, they form a splendid illumination : this is Hallow-E'en, and is a night of great festivity. \u2014 \" These several particulars,\" says the very worthy and intelligent Minister, The Reverend Thomas Bisset, D. D., \" if con- sidered separately, may appear trifling ; but, taken altogether, they form no in- considerable part of what (with only some slight variations) the religion ofthe vulgar will always be, in every age, and in every stage of society, and indeed, whatever be the religion which they profess ; unless they are so grossly stupid, or so flagitiously immoral, as to be incapable of feeling the restraints of any sys tem of Religion, whether rational or superstitious.\" \u2014 A Roman medal of Trajan was discovered here.

Sterling : the manse, and offices, are in excellent repair: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent, together with a good garden : Patron, The Crown : The Church was re-built in a handsome style, in 1795. It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resi- dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Kingoody, and Lochtown) was 1569, and, in 1811, was 1809. It is 5|- m. W. from Dundee. The Village of Long-Forgan, which belongs entirely to the Estate of Castle- Huntly, is beautifully situate on the rising ground that bounds the Carse of Goiv rie on the East, and commands a fine prospect ofthe course ofthe river Tay for above 20 miles. It appears to have been originally called Forgund, from a grant ofthe lands and Barony of Long- Forgund to Sir Andrew Gray, of Broxmouth."], [367, "LON by King Robert Bruce, in the year 1315. In 1672, it was erected into a free Burgh of Barony by Charles the Second, in favour of Patrick Earl of Strath more and Kinghorn ; with power to elect and constitute Baillies, Burgesses, Clerks, Officers, and Serjeants, and to admit all kinds of trades to a variety of privileges ; and to have a weekly Market within the Burgh, and two annual Fairs ; one of which is now holden on the third Wednesday in June, and the other on the third Wednesday in October. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a School-house, and dwelling: this School is well conducted, and Mr. Paterson, with a liberality which redounds to his honour and benevolence, pays for the education of twelve poor scholars, and distributes premiums to the most deserving. Coals are the common fuel. The climate is healthy. This Parish contains about 7,000 acres, and is bounded on the South by the river Tay, which is here between two and three miles broad, and when the tide ebbs, it leaves near a mile of dry sand. The surface is irregular ; but the soil is in general a rich clay, and exceedingly fertile. Free stone, of an excellent quality, is abundant. Here are considerable plantations in a flourishing condition. Game is in plenty. Services of all kinds are abolished. The roads are in good repair. Castle- Huntly, which is built on the top of a rock, that rises in the middle of a plain, commands one of the most extensive and varied prospects that can be imagined : it is said to have been erected about the year 1452, by Andrew the second Lord Gray, of Foulis, and named in honour of his Lady, who was of the family of Huntly. In 1615, it came by purchase into the possession of the family of Lyon, Earls of Kinghorn, who changed its name to Castle-Lyon; and, in 1672, Earl Patrick having obtained a Charter in favour of Long-Forgan, the Barony was erected into a Lordship, to be called The Lordship of Lyon. In 1777, this Castle was purchased, together with the Estate, by the present proprietor, George Paterson, Esq., who has repaired it in the most elegant manner, and laid out the plantations and pleasure grounds in the finest modern style : and has also restored the ancient name of Huntly, by which it was so long known, while in possession of the Noble family of Gray. Dr immie- House, belonging to Lord Kinnaird, has become the residence of that Noble family, in consequence of their Castle of Moncur having been burned down in the beginning of the Eighteenth Century. Mylnefield, the Seat of Mr. Mylne, is beautifully situate on a rising ground, and is surrounded with fine plantations. LONGFOR-MACUS, properly LOCHER-MACUS, in the Shire of Ber wick : formerly a Rectory, with the ancient Parish of Ellam conjoined, some"], [368, "LON time before the year 1750 ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., with a manse, and glebe : Patron, Mr. Home : The Church is in decent order. It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 406, and, in 1811, was 444. It is 5jtn. N W. b. W. from Dunse. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth : its surface is hilly, being in the midst of the great Lammer-Muir ridge : it is mostly covered with heath, and supports about 10,000 sheep. The air is dry, cold, and piercing. It is watered by the rivers Whittadder, and Dye. The Roads are bad. There are some appearances of a rich copper ore, but it has never been worked. The two beautiful conical hills, called The Dirrington Laws, which are seen at a great distance, are in this Parish. At a place, called Byrecleugh, is a heap of stones, of considerable extent, which, it is supposed, was collected to perpetuate some remarkable event. The mosses, and moors, in tlie Parish, supply the inhabitants with fuel ; but some coal is brought from a distance. LONG-HAVEN, in the District of Ellon, and Shire of Aberdeen: in the Parish of Cruden. This is a small Fishing Village, upon the German Ocean. LONGHOPE, v. WAAS.

This Parish is an irregular square, of about 5 miles : and the surface is so very level, that when the river Ugie, which intersects it, overflows its banks, it lays almost the whole Parish under water. The soil is in general light, and easily improved. The number of acres is about 12,000 ; of which, 7000 are in a state of culture, 1800"], [369, "LOR are moss, 257 are planted, and the remainder is muir. Nearly one-half of the whole Parish belongs to Mr. Ferguson, of Pitfour, who has made considerable improvements upon his estate. Besides the spinning of flax to a great amount for the thread-manufactures in Peferhea.-. , a manufacture of woollen cloth has lately been established at Nether Kinmundy, the property of Francis Garden, Esq., of Troup, which is attended with success. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with school-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood of land. Peats are abundant.

It is in the Presbytery of Deer, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1607, and, in 1811, was 1627. It is 6 m. S. E. from Fraser's-Burgh. The Fair is holden on the first Tuesday, O. S., in June. This Parish has at different times been called St. Colm, from the name ofthe Saint to whom the old Church was dedi cated ; and Longmay or Lonmay, from the name of the estate to which the Church was removed in 1787. It is about 10 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the German Ocean. The soil is various: but in general fertile, and well cultivated. The air is rather moist, but not unhealthy. The sea-coast is flat and sandy, and Mr. Gordon has lately built two consider able fishing villages upon his estate. Peats are in abundance : and lime-stone is also found in great quantities on the estate of Craigellie, which is much used for manure. Cairness, the elegant Seat of Mr. Gordo\"n, is surrounded with ex tensive pleasure grounds and plantations, laid out with great taste. LORETTO, v. MUSSELBURGH. . LORN, a District, in the Shire of Argyle. It is about 30 miles in length, and 9 miles in breadth, and is bounded on the West by the Atlantic Ocean, and The Sound of Mull. It is watered by many Lakes and Rivers, on the banks of which there is much arable land; and it is the most pleasant and fertile District in the County. It consists of three Divisions, which were, in the time of Robert Bruce, possessed by the Macdougals, opponents of that Prince ; they passed from them to the Stuarts ; but in the Fifteenth Century were trans- vol. ii.

This is a flourishing Village (containing 273 In habitants, in 1811), situate at the confluence ofthe river Lossie with the Moray Firth : and has a small Harbour, capable of admitting vessels of light burden. It was formerly the property of the family of Brodie, from whom it was purchased by the Magistrates of Elgin, and who pay a small feu-duty. Two fishing Boats ara employed here, which principally supply the Town of Elgin, and the adja cent Country, with fish of various kinds. The river Lossie has its source in the hills of Dallas, and, after a course of nearly 26 measured miles, discharges itself here into the sea, and gives name to the Village. It is subordinate to the Cus tom-House at Inverness. Here are strata of red-coloured argillaceous sand stone. LOTH, in the Shire of Sutherland : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of bear, and \u00a326.. 7.. 9\\. Sterling, including \u00a350.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of The Glen) was 1374, and, in 1811, was 1330. It is 12 m. N. E. from Golspie. This Parish extends about 14 miles along the German Ocean, and is from a quarter to three quarters of a mile in breadth. The soil along the coast is in general fertile ; but in the interior, the surface becomes elevated, and the hills are covered with a short black heath. The coast is in some places rocky, in others, a sandy beach : there are several boat harbours, but that of Culgour is accounted the best, and might be rendered a safe harbour for Ships at a moderate sum. Fuel is expensive, on account of the dis- tance ofthe peat mosses, and the badness ofthe roads. The climate is healthy. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, and a decent School- house. The hills in this Parish were of old famous for hunting ; and the deer of the Forest of Steitil are often very troublesome to the inhabitants of The Glen in summer and harvest, by their depredations among the corn. The last unhappy woman who suffered for witchcraft in Scotland, went from this Parish : she was burnt at Dornoch : and the common people entertain strong prejudices against her relations to this day. It is watered by the rivers Helmsdale, and Loth, both"], [371, "LOU of which abound with fish ; and in the latter is a fine cataract. Here is an' en tire Picts' house. At Craiag, there was formerly a square tower, which was erected by Lady Jane Gordon, Countess of Sutherland ; but not a vestige of it now remains. LOTHERS, or LAUDERS, a lofty range of Mountains, which, beginning at Cheviot, on the East, runs quite across the Island, to Loch Ryan, on the West. The steep face of this range fronts the North, particularly towards the East side of the Island, where, for along way together, it makes the boundary between South and North Britain. The middle and western parts of it are all comprehended in Scotland. It is highest in the centre of the Island, near the sources of the Tweed, the Annan, the Clyde, and the Nith, where it is known by the general name of The Lothers. LOTHIAN, an extensive and fertile District, which comprehends the Three Shires of East Lothian, or Hadington, \u2014 Mm Lothian, or Edinburgh,\u2014 and West Lothian, or Linlithgow. It is of high antiquity, and Polydore Virgil informs us, that Laudonia, in his time, was an extensive District, beginning at the Tweed, and stretching considerably beyong the City of Edinburgh. Lothian gives the title of Marquis and Earl to the Ancient and Noble family of Kerr. These three Shires are not included in any Circuit, but have their Criminal trials at Edinburgh. LOUDON, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 76 bolls of meal, 12 bolls ofbear, \u00a321. in money, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse was built in 1768 : the glebe consists of 12 acres : Patron, The Countess of Loudon : The Church was lately rebuilt. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glas- gow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting of the Villages of Auld-Town, Derval, Loudon, and New Mills) was 2503, and, in 1811, was 3170. It is 8 m. E. from Killmarnock. This Parish contains about 10,000 acres ; of which, about 7500 are arable. The soil is, in general, a rich deep loam ; and agriculture is well attended to. Four-fifths ofthe Parish are the property of The Countess of Loudon : the other Heritors, and feuers, are nu- merous, but they all pay feu to the family of Loudon, except Captain Nisbet, of Carfin, near Hamilton. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School fees, and perquisites, and an excellent School house and dwelling. The climate is rainy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Coals, and lime-stone, are in the greatest abundance. Provisions of all Zz2"], [372, "LOW kinds are in plenty, and cheap. The House of Loudon, an Earldom in the Ancient and Illustrious family of Campbell, is an extensive building, surrounded with extensive woods, and contains a Library of about 10,000 volumes. The ancient custom of kindling fires on the high grounds, in honour of Bealtain, still prevails here : but it is now observed on St: Peter's day. It formerly belonged to the Monastery of Killwinning. LOUISBURGH, in the Shire of Caithness; and in the Parish of Wick. This is a Fishing village, near the town of Wick, lately erected on the estate of Sir Benjamin Dunbar, Bart., of Hempriggs: and is so named, in compliment to Lady Dunbar, whose Christian name is Louisa. LOVAT, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Kirk-Hill. It is f m. S. E. from Beauly. Here stood the Tower aud Fort of Lovat, anciently the seat of the Bissets, and now of The Honourable Colonel Archibald Fraser. It is pleasantly situate near the Eastern bank of the river Beauly, in a rich and fertile country ; and formerly gave the title of Baron, attainted in 1745. The Barony from which Lord Lovat took his title came into the family by the mar riage of Sir Simon Fraser, a little before the year 1300, with the heiress of Lord Bisset, a Nobleman of great possessions in these parts. Legislature gave the most honourable testimony to the merit ofthe son, by restoring, in 1774, the for feited fortunes of the father : and no patent for Nobility conveyed greater glory to any one, than the Preamble to the Act has done to this worthy Gentleman. See, Beauly. LOWLAND-MAN'S BAY, v. JURA. LOWLANDS, one ofthe greater Divisions of Scotland. The principal part ofthe Lowlands of Scotland are situate on the North ofthe Lammer-Muir Hills, extending quite across the Island from sea to sea, and reaching as far as the Grampian Mountains ; that stupendous and seemingly impenetrable barrier, which, like a mighty wall, stretches along the Southern front ofthe Highlands. Into this extensive Plain the Firths of Forth and Clyde indent themselves from opposite seas, thereby forming that remarkable Isthmus which is by far the nar rowest part of Britain ; and along this neck of land the Romans conducted their second Wall. But besides many detached hills, situate in this level tract, there are two ranges, which, though by no means so formidable as the Highland Mountains, yet seem conspicuous enough in a low country, and therefore deserve to be mentioned. The first is composed of The Pentland Hills, which, begin ning near the Firth of Forth on the East, run Westward, and end at the borders"], [373, "LUC of Clydesdale. The second is of equal extent with the Grampian Mountains, to which it is nearly parallel, beginning at Stonehaven, on the German Ocean, and reaching South-West across the Island, for the space of 112 miles, to Dum barton, on the Firth of Clyde. This long range is sub-divided into three princi pal sections : that towards the East extends as far as the Tay, under the general name of the Sidlaw or Sadley Hills : The Ochil Mountains form the central part thereof, between the Tay and the Forth: and, from the Forth to the Clyde, its Western Division is continued under the names of The Killsyth and Camp sey Hills. Though the long valley, comprehended between the Grampian Mountains and this smaller range, may be denominated, in general, Strathmore, signifying The Great Strath, or Valley : yet Strathmore, properly so called, is situate in the Eastern division of it, between Stonehaven and the Tay.

This Parish, previous to the year 1646, constituted part ofthe Parish of Glen Luce ; when, for the better accommodation of the Inhabitants, that ex tensive tract was divided into two Parishes, one of them being named New, and the other Old Luce. It is about 10 miles in length, and from 5 to 6 miles in breadth : the surface is irregular, rising from the banks of the river Luce, to the high lands which occupy by far the greater part of the Parish ; these exhibit either the bare rocks, or are sparingly covered with heath, moss, or a species of coarse grass, called sprett, which is cut for hay : the arable land is small in pro portion, and principally lies along the banks ofthe rivers. The roads are in bad repair. The Earl of Stair is the chief Proprietor.

It is situate at the confluence of the river Luce with the Bay of the same name, and possesses the small Harbours of Auchenmalg, Kirk-Christ, and Pooltanton. The surface though hilly, is not very elevated, and about one half of it is arable : the remainder being appropriated to the pasturage of sheep, and black cattle ; but great improvements in agriculture are making here. A considerable Salmon fishery is carried on in the rivers Luce, and Pooltanton. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and per quisites, and \u00a31. Sterling annually from a mortification by the late Rev. James Tweddale, Minister of Old Luce, for the education of four poor children.

The Abbey of Glen Luce was founded in the year 1190, for Monks of the Cistertian Order, by Roland Macdoual, Lord of Galloway, and Constable of Scotland. The Monks of this Abbey were brought from Melross. In 1602, King James the Sixth erected Glenluce into a Tempor ality in favour of Laurence Gordon ; which, in 1606, was confirmed by an Act of Parliament. It was afterwards united to the Bishoprick of Galloway ; and at length, Sir James Dalrymple, President of the Session, a gentleman of an ancient Family in Carrick, was created Lord Glenluce; his Son, Sir John Dalrymple, King's Advocate, Justice Clerk, and Secretary of State, was like wise Lord Glenluce and Earl of Stair. A Thomas Hay was appointed Com mendator so late as the year 1560 ; and the Pope's Bull, dated at Rome, on the 2d of May 1560, appointing him Commendator Vallis Lucis atque de Glenluce, is still in the possession ofthe Commendator's Family, Sir Thomas Hay, Bart., of Park, in this Parish ; and whose property the ruins of The Abbey now are.

The Loch of Auchlossen, which is a mile in length, and upwards of half a mile in breadth, abounds with eels, and pike of a very large size, and a variety of aquatic birds. Fuel is expensive. The public roads are in tolerable repair. There are several ancient fortifications, and cairns ; one of which, about a mile North from the Church, is called Macbeth's Cairn, and is said to contain the ashes of that Usurper. LUMSDEN SHORE, v.

The soil is, in general, light and gravelly, but in some parts there is good loam : the greatest part is hilly and mountainous. The climate is mild and temperate ; and the air, though often moist, is remark- ably healthful. Fuel is expensive. At Camstradden, the property of one of the ancient Family of Colquhoun, there is a very valuable Quarry of excellent blue slate ; and another also upon the estate of Luss. In the South end of the Parish, there is likewise a very good free-stone Quarry, but it is only worked occasionallY.

LYNE, in the Shire of Peebles : formerly a Rectory, with the Parish of Megget united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a glebe: the manse is indecent repair: Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry: The Church is ancient, but having lately undergone a thorough repair, is now a commodious place of Worship ; the Pulpit is said to be a remarkable piece of mechanism, which was imported from Holland, in 1644, by Lady Yester, whose Pew bears the same date ; the Pew of the Family of Vetch is dated in 1606. It is in the Presbytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and Tweed- dale. The Resident Population of the United Parishes of Lyne and Megget, in 1801, was 167, and, in 1811, was 194. It is 4\u00b1 m. W. from Peebles. The Parish of Lyne is between three and four miles long, and nearly three miles broad. The river Lyne, which runs from one extremity of the Parish to the other, is one ofthe largest that falls into the Tweed in this County. The lower part ofthe Parish is, in general, of a sharp gravelly soil : the upper part is hilly, and affords good pasturage for sheep. The distance from Coals, and Lime, is not great ; the Roads are good ; and there are two convenient Bridges over the river. It appears from the Scots Acts of Parliament, vol. i. p. 960, that the Parish"], [379, "MAC of Rodonno or Megget, was annexed to that of Lyne, about the year 1621 : and that this Union took place, in consequence of a joint petition from the Proprietor and Inhabitants ofthe former Parish, to the Lords Commissioners for Plantation of Kirks, desiring that they might henceforth be considered as a part ofthe latter. It is singular, that Megget should not have been united to one of the neighbour ing Parishes, rather than to Lyne, which is so distant from it. Perhaps the smallness both of the Stipends and Cures might be the chief reason : besides, both Parishes at that period belonged wholly to one Proprietor, Lord Hay, of Vester, and, it is more than probable, that he had considerable influence in pro curing the annexation. About half a mile West from the Church of Lyne, is a Roman camp of about 6 acres in extent, now called Randalts Walls : The situation of it appears to have been chosen with great judgement; the road leading to it is still visible, and runs through the present glebe : the ground within the encampment has frequently been ploughed, and it is said, that Roman Coins, and other antiquities, have been discovered there.

This is a considerable and improving Fishing Town on the Moray Firth, and contains 1000 Inhabitants. The Har bour, which has been formed at the expense of The Earl of Fife, and to whom the Town belongs, is one ofthe best in the Moray Firth. Several manufacturers, and other persons, have been induced to build substantial and commodious houses here, and from every appearance there is reason to believe, that this Town will rapidly increase in population and prosperity. It gives the title of Viscount to The Earl of Fife.

The climate is moist, but not unhealthy. Loch Goull, or The Bishop's Loch, is a beautiful small Lake, well stocked with pike ; and in it is an Island with the ruins of a Castle, which was formerly inhabited by the Bishops of Aberdeen. The public road is in good repair. Peats, and turf, are the common fuel : but the mosses are greatly exhausted. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. Some personal services are still exacted. Muir, and free-stone, are in plenty ; but lime-stone is very scarce. New and elegant Houses have lately been built at Elrick, and Straloch. In 1247, Ramsay Bishop of Aber- deen appointed a Chaplain and a Clerk at the Chapel of Monycabbuck in this Parish, about a mile South-West from the present Church, to preach to the Parishioners there : in the year 1639, a Church was built where the present one now stands ; and, in 1641, the Minister at the Chapel of Monycabbuck, was re- moved to it ; there are some remains of the Chapel, and the ground around it is still used as a Burial-place.

The climate is wet, and cold. The Parochial School is under excellent manage ment, and is deservedly in high repute, from the unwearied attention and great literary acquirements of The Rev. David Malcolm. Coals are the common fuel. The roads are bad. A part ofthe great Roman road, from the camp at Ardoch to the place where it crosses the Tay, runs for about a quarter of a mile through the Southern extremity of the Parish, and is still entire. The Abbey of Inch- Effray, which is situate on an eminence, nearly surrounded by the Pow, was founded in the year 1200 by Gilbert, Earl of Strathearn, and his Countess Matilda, and dedicated to the Honour of God, the Virgin Mary, and St. John the Apostle and Evangelist. It was endowed with many privileges by King David the First, and Alexander the Third, and was esteemed one ofthe richest Abbies in the Kingdom. The several edifices are now in ruins, and the stones have, in the most reprehensible manner, been applied to building houses, and making roads in the neighbourhood. The few remains of this ancient Abbey, together with six or seven acres of land around it, now belong to The Earl of Kin noul ; who, in consequence of this comparatively small possession, is Patron of twelve Parishes which were formerly attached to it. James Drummond, son to David Lord Drummond, having acquired a right to this Monastery from Alex ander Gordon Bishop of Galloway, then Commendator thereof, it was by the favour of King James the Sixth, in 1607, erected to him in a Temporal Lordship, by the style of Lord Madderty : which title was forfeited in 1715.

The Tweed is not navigable here. It is famous for its mutton. All the Coals, and Lime, used here, are brought from Northum berland, about 20 miles ; or from Mid-Lothian, at a still greater distance. A Turnpike road, which is in tolerably good repair, runs through the Parish. The Statute labour is not exacted in kind, but is commuted at a fixed rate. The Monks of Kelso had anciently a considerable property here. MALENY, v. CURRIE. MALEW, ST., in The Isle of Man : The Church is a gloomy and venerable building, situate, as the Manks Churches generally are, in a romantic solitude. The Resident Population of this Village, in 1792, was 1466. It is l\u00a3 m. N. from Castle-Town, the Metropolis ofthe Island, which belongs to this Parish. It has no Parsonage-house for its Minister. MALT AN WALLS, v. ANCRUM."], [385, "MAN MAM-RAATACHAN, in INVERNESS, v. RANNOCH. MANGERTON, v. CASTLE-TOWN. MAN, THE ISLE of, in The Irish Sea. It is situate 30 m. W. from St. Bee's Head in Cumberland, 16 m. S. from Burrow Head in Scotland, and 27 m. E. from Strangford in Ireland. The Latitude of the centre of the Island is 54\u00b0 16' North. It extends from North to South upwards of 30 miles, but rarely exceeds 12 miles in breadth. It was known to Ptolomey, and Pliny, by the names of Monoeda, and Monabia. This Island is divided into two unequal portions by a chain of mountains, running from North-East to South-West; the most lofty of which are Snaufel, and North and South Barrule. From the high land several small rivers descend, besides numerous small streams, that abound with trout, though of an inferior size. The Northern part of the Island is a light sand, resting on a bed of common clay ; but the greatest portion consists of a barren soil, resting upon slate : and the mountains are formed chiefly of strata of clay- slate, much intersected by veins of quartz. Its chief mineral productions are those of lead, and copper. All mines belong by Prerogative to the Lord Proprie- tor ofthe soil : they are let to a Company, and the Lord Proprietor, as Lessor, claims one-eighth part of their gross produce. Hares, partridges, woodcocks, snipes, and wild ducks, are abundant ; and, during the season of incubation, the rocks are covered with prodigious numbers of aquatic birds. The game laws are now nearly obsolete. Noxious reptiles are not to be found. This Island, like The Hebrides, is destitute of woods, and of almost all trees not planted, i The climate of The Isle of Man is rather milder than that of the neighbouring shores; frost and snow being of very short continuance. The heat of summer, on the other hand, is not so great ; and the harvests are consequently late, and immature. Gales of wind and heavy falls of rain are frequent, and of long duration. A spirit of improvement in agriculture has lately become more general, by the exten- sion of The Cumberland Agricultural Society ; though the Fisheries engage their principal attention. A conversion ofthe Tythe, now payable in kind, into an unalterable sum of money, equal to its present value, has been proposed as an improvement ; together with the lengthening the term of leases, which are limited by law to Twenty-one years. The uncultivated land is estimated at rather more than one-third of the Island. The roads have, for a long time, been in an im proving state : and by the Statute of 1776, new High ways are ordered to be eight yards wide, to have ditches on each side, aud to be well gravelled at the top, and which are made and repaired by a fund arising from a tax upon every retailer vol. ii. 3 B"], [386, "MAN of ale or spirits, upon lands and houses, dogs, and some few and trifling fines.

The History ofthe Island is involved in darkness and fable, until the descent of Orry, a Danish Prince ; who, after subduing the Orkneys and Hebrides, at last established his Throne in Mona. In the eleventh century it was seized by Godred Crovan, a Norwegian Hero ; from whom the Sovereignty descended to Magnus, the last Prince ofthe Norwegian line ; who, finding himself unable to retain the Sovereignty of The Western Isles, agreed to surrender them to Alexander the Third, King of Scotland, for a stipulated sum, and dying, in"], [387, "MAN 1265, was buried in the Abbey Church of Rushen. Alexander, an active and politic Prince, soon regained the Hebrides ; and Mona, no longer protected by the Crown of Norway, in 1270, increased the honours of his conquest. The Island was now governed by Thanes or Lieutenants appointed by the Scottish Monarchy : until Sir William de Montacute, who had married a descendant of Godred Crovan, having collected a body of English troops, under the sanction of Edward the Third, to prosecute his Lady's right, soon reduced the Island ; and, by command ofthe English Monarch, in 1344, was crowned King of Man. But Montacute did not long retain this honour ; for, having contracted a con siderable debt for this war, and being unable to discharge it, he mortgaged the Kingdom for seven years to Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham, who soon after obtained a Grant ofthe Island from Richard the Second. On this Prelate's de cease, the Kingdom of Man reverted to Montacute, now created Earl of Salisbury ; who soon after sold it to Sir William Scroop, Chamberlain to she King. Richard's fate is well known ; and Scroop, on Henry's assumption of the Crown of England, being beheaded, The Isle of Man was then granted by that Monarch to Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and his heirs ; on con dition that they should carry on their left shoulder, at the coronation of the Eng lish Monarchs, the sword with which Henry was girt when he returned from France in 1399. Four years afterwards, Percy was attainted for attempting to shake that throne, which he had so zealously contributed to establish ; but his perfidy was frustrated by the vigilance and policy of Henry ; and, although subsequently restored in blood, and to his estates in England, The Isle of Man was permanently forfeited ; and, in the sixth year ofthe same reign, was con ferred on Sir John Stanley for life ; and soon afterwards (in 1406), he enjoyed a new and ample Grant, which extended to his heirs and successors (afterwards Earls of Derby ;) \" to be holden ofthe Crown of England by liege homage, and the service of rendering to the English Monarchs two Falcons on their Corona tion.\" By this liberality of Henry the Fourth, Sir John Stanley and his descend ants enjoyed a plenitude of Regal power and dignity; which proceeded regularly, and without molestation, from ancestor to heir to the time of William, the Sixth Earl of Derby, against whose title some objections were started and legally re moved. But to put the matter beyond all doubt, William obtained from James the First a new Grant of The Isle of Man, which was confirmed by Act of Parliament. This Island was one of the last places that yielded to the authority of Cromwell. General Ireton having proposed to James, the Seventh and 3B2"], [388, "MAN magnanimous Earl of Derby, on the part ofthe Parliament, the re-possession of his Estates in England, provided he would surrender The Isle of Man, the proposal was treated with the highest indignation ; and his memorable answer, to \" forbear any further solicitations, for if you trouble me with any more mes sages upon this occasion, I will burn the paper and hang the messenger ,\" is re corded by Mr. Hume. This spirited Earl, being taken prisoner after the battle of Worcester, was executed on the 15th of October, 1651, at Bolton. His Countess, the gallant defender of Latham House, being then in The Isle of Man, resolved to preserve his possessions, and retiring into Castle Rushen, determined to defend that Fortress to the last extremity ; but Captain Christian, in whom she chiefly confided, and who had the command of the Manks forces, deeming her cause hopeless, capitulated to Colonels Birch and Duckenfield, who, with ten armed vessels, had invaded the island. Soon aster its reduction in 1652, it was granted by the Parliament to Lord Fairfax. But, on the accession of Charles the Second, The Isle of Man, with all its regalities and privileges, was restored to Charles, Earl of Derby, the Son ofthe Nobleman who suffered at Bolton. In this family it continued until the year 1735, when James, the tenth Earl, dying without issue, this ample inheritance devolved on James, the second Duke of Athol, who was descended from Lady Amelia Sophia, the youngest daughter of the Seventh Earl of Derby. He was succeeded by his Nephew, John, who was partly intimidated, and partly allured to resign the Kingdom of his Ancestors for \u00a370,000. And*, accordingly, on the 7th of March 1765, The Regal Dignity of Mona was lost for ever in the superior effulgence of The British Diadem. In 1781, The Duke of Athol presented a petition to Parlia ment, which stated, among other complaints, that many parts ofthe Act ofthe 5\u00b0 Geo. III., required explanation and amendment, and that proper remedies or powers were omitted to be given by the said Act to The Duke and Duchess of Athol, their heirs or assigns, seneschals or stewards, and moors and bailiffs, for the obtaining of the several rights and interests, or for the exercise or enjoyment of such as were intended to be reserved ; and, therefore, prayed that leave might be given to bring in a bill to explain and amend the said Act, and to enable the said Duke and his heirs, to obtain, exercise, and enjoy, certain powers and remedies : A petition was presented by The House of Keys against the passing of the Bill ; which, however, somewhat amended, passed The Commons, but was lost in The House of Lords. In 1790, the Duke again petitioned Parliament, which was again opposed by The House of Keys ; and, on the order of the day"], [389, "MAN for the commitment of the Bill being read, Mr. Chancellor Pitt observed, \" that notwithstanding his full conviction of the propriety and even necessity of proceeding with such a measure, yet, after the unfavourable impression which had gained ground upon the subject, he should think it in no degree prudent to attempt to push the Bill further at present, and should therefore move, that the Bill be committed for that day three months :\" the Bill was consequently lost. In 1805, a third Petition was presented by The Duke to Parliament, which, like the former, was referred to a Committee ; and which, after great opposition both in the House of Commons, and in the House of Lords, was finally carried, and the Bill soon afterwards received His Majesty's assent : The Duke being allowed one-fourth of the gross revenues of The Isle of Man to himself and his heirs for ever, which being then estimated at \u00a312,000., yields an annual income of \u00a33,000. His Majesty has the appointment of all the military, and all the chief civil officers. He alone has the power of pardoning criminals : and may in Council hear, and finally determine, all appeals from the decision of The Governor or of The Keys. His consent is necessary to the passing of all Laws. The Governor holds his office, by His Majesty's appointment. He is Chan cellor, ex officio, and, by himself or deputy, hears appeals, not relative to land, from the decision of inferior Courts, reversing or confirming them according to his judgement. The consent of himself or of his Lieutenant is necessary to the making of a Law ; but not that of The Lord Proprietor, at present The Duke of Athol, unless he holds one of those situations. The latter may, how ever, enter caveats against the King's consent, and have his petition heard ; and in, or about the year 1789, he actually did so. The Lieutenant Governor has now all the powers of the Governor during his absence ; and none during his presence, except what the Governor does not think proper to resume. The Council consists of Five Persons, holding their seats ex officio, viz , The Lord Bishop, The Water Bailiff, The Attorney General, The Clerk ofthe Rolls, and The Archdeacon. The consent of a majority of these, previously to that of The King, is necessary to the passing of a Law. The Twenty-Four Keys are the last branch ofthe Manks Legislature. The consent of a majority of them is necessary to the passing of a Law ; and a Bill usually originates in this House. They are considered the Guardians of the people, particularly so ofthe landed interest, and their power is as well judicial as legislative. An appeal may be made to them from the inferior Courts. In all actions real, and in appeals, their decision is conclusive between the parties, unless the cause be carried before the"], [390, "M A N King in Council. They determine in all cases by a majority. In intricate law cases they are required to decide what the law ofthe land is ; every determina tion forming a precedent for future cases. Bishop Wilson derives their name from their office of unlocking the difficulties of the Law. Their election of a Speaker is subject to the approbation ofthe King : he gives, when required, the casting vote. In their legislative capacity their debates are always private. The situation brings with it considerable honour, much trouble, but no emolu ment. The Keys always possessed, and seem never to have abused, the confi dence of the people. The Laws passed by the Legislature of this Island are called Acts of Tinwald. Before they become binding upon the people, they must, according to long usage, be promulgated from a certain artificial Mount, near the spot where the High-road from Castle-Town to Ramsay, and that from Douglas to Peel, cross each other, called Tlie Tinwald Hill, the day of the na tivity of St. John the Baptist being formerly the only usual time of such promul gation Hence il is, that the Acts derive their names. A High Bailiff resides at each of the four Towns, and holds his Court there once in every week : \u2014 The Parishes of Lonan, Oncan, Kirk-Braddan, andKirk-Marown, are under the juris diction of the Bailiff of Douglas : \u2014 Malew, Santqn, Kjrk Arbory, and Kirk Christ Rushen, under that of the Bailiff of Castle-Town :\u2014 Jturk Patrick, St. Germain, Kirk Michael, and Ballaugh, under that of the Bailiff of Peel :\u2014 and Jurby, Kirk Andreas, Kirk Bride, Kifk Christ Lezayre, and KickMaughold, under that of the Bailiff of Ramsay : \u2014 This Court was instituted in 1777. The High-Bailiff is the only Judge who takes cognizance of complaints and debts under the value of 40s. He usually determines them at the first hearing, in the presence ofthe par ties, who are summoned by his Warrant. There are Two Deemsters in the Island, one of whom is Judge or Chief Justice ofthe Southern Division, and usually holds his Court at Castle-Town ; \u2014 The other presides over the Northern Division, and usually holds his Court at Ramsay. Their Jurisdiction is extensive, being com petent to decide all causes exceeding the value of 40*., not being actions where damages are to be assessed, or such as come properly before the Chancellor ; all such as respect defamation, slander, or simple breach ofthe peace ; and all ap peals from the judgement of the High-Bailiff. A Court of Common Law is holden at Castle-Town, and at Ramsay, four times in the year ; the term com mencing one week later at the latter than at the former place. There are also Courts of Admiralty, of Exchequer, and of Chancery : together likewise with an Ecclesiastical Court, and The Great Inquest. The Inhabitants appear"], [391, "MAN to be content with their Laws ; and the decisions of the Governor, and Deemsters, are considered extremely equitable. The Isle of Man is a place of considerable resort for strangers, and is become so chiefly or altogether upon two accounts. The First is, that it is a place which is privileged by law from all debts not contracted here ; and from debts contracted here, if not with the inhabitants as far as respects the person and money of the debtor, but not his goods; and it is so much the resort of persons of this description, that a man, on his arrival, is immediately suspected of coming hither to avoid his Creditors: \u2014 The Second is, that a family may live, especially in the country, and more particularly at the Northern part, at a very small expense. All Letters for The Isle of Man are brought from Whitehaven to Douglas by a Packet, which ought to leave that Port every Monday night, but which is occasionally delayed by tempestuous weather : it contains good accom- modations for Passengers ; \u2014 Besides which, there is a Packet that sails weekly from Liverpool with Passengers only. The Passage from Whitehaven is 9*., and from Liverpool 10*. Qd. Markets for provisions are directed to be holden at Castle-Town, Douglas, Peel, aud Ramsay; but they are only regular at Douglas. Fairs for the sale of horses, cattle, and wearing apparel the manu- facture of the Island, and for the hiring of servants, are numerous; and about six of them are well attended. There is no established Market for grain ; .so that those who are likely to want that commodity, generally make a contract with the Farmers as soon as the harvest is got in. The principal exports are herrings, linen, potatoes, butter, coarse paper, kelp, and marble and paving stones. The imports are manufactured goods of almost every description, chiefly from Liverpool ; coals, wine, and spirituous liquors : the balance estrade being greatly against the Island. Gold, and silver coins are very scarce. The Copper coinage is peculiar to the Island, fourteen Manks pence making one English shilling. Greenock guinea notes are the chief substitute for gold ; and various one-shilling, half-a-crown, three-shilling, five-shilling, and seven-shilling tickets or cards, are issued by the merchants and manufacturers to prevent any inconvenience that might arise from the scarcity of silver. Until the Act of re-vestment in 1765, and the subsequent regulations, the chief business of the place was smuggling ; but, since that period, the contraband trade has been nearly annihilated. Hospitality, piety, and benevolence, are pre-eminent vir tues among the inhabitants. In every Parish is at least one Charity School, and often a small Library. These were founded by Bishops Barrow, and Wilson ;"], [392, "MAN they are supported by voluntary contributions, and many of them have funds arising from legacies and donations. The Earse is the prevailing language. The Religion ofthe Island is that ofthe Established Church of England. All sects are tolerated ; but no marriage is legal, unless the ceremony be performed ac cording to the custom ofthe Protestant Church. The care of the Church de volves upon the Bishop, the Arch-Deacon, the two Vicars General, and the Episcopal Registrar. The Act of re-vestment reserves in the Athol Family all its former Ecclesiastical patronage. The Bishop, having been nominated by The Duke of Athol, and received His Majesty's approbation, is consecrated by The Archbishop of York. He enjoys all the pre-eminences and spiritual rights of other Bishops; but, his See not being a Barony, has no vote in The British House of Peers. The Bishoprick of Sodor was first instituted by Pope Gregory the Fourth in the ninth Century. It is said to have been erected in Sodor, an imaginary Village either in Man or I-Colm-Kill. The Bishops ofthe Western Isles possessed the title of Sodor only, until the year 1098, when King Magnus, of Norway, conquering The Hebrides, and The Isle of Man, united the two Bishopricks of Sodor, and Man (this See having been erected by St. Patrick, in 447) ; which continued so united until the English were possessed of The Isle of Man, in 1333. And, although the Bishop of Man had no claim to the Bishoprick of JSodor from that time, the title is continued to the present day. Another deriv ation is, however, given of Sodor, it being, according to Torf\u00e6us, a corruption of Suder, i. e. Southern : the Norwegians being accustomed to call the most Northern Hebrides, Nordereys, from Noder, North, and / or Eye, an Island ; and the Southern, of which I-Colm-Kill is one, Sudereys ; all the last named being in the Diocese of Sodor, and lying to the Southward of the Point of Ardnamurchan. In most of the Parishes of Man, the Service is performed on alternate Sundays in the Manks, and in the English language. The Churches have no peculiar characteristic. MANOR, v. LOGIE. MANOR, in the Shire of Peebles : formerly a Chapelry, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3116. in money, and a glebe of 23| Scotch acres : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The old Church, which was four miles distant from the present one, and which was removed, about the middle ofthe Seven teenth Century, to the South part of the Parish, where it now stands, was called St. Gordian's Kirk : both the Church, and Manse, were lately repaired by the Heritors. It is in the Presbytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and"], [393, "MAR Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 308, and, in 1811, was 302. It is 2\\ m. S. S. W. from Peebles. This Parish is said to contain 18,1 10 acres of land. It is mountainous ; but towards the South, where it is more open, there is excellent arable ground, which is well cultivated. The hills in the Upper part of the Parish, on both sides of the water of Manor, -are very high, and so closely adjoining to each other, as to occasion very sudden inundations, when the rainy season sets in, on the approach of Winter. The arable land bears but a very small proportion to the pasture ; and lies mostly at the bottom ofthe hills, along the river Manor, and partly on the banks ofthe Tweed. It is naturally fertile, and of a sharp soil: and the Harvest is rather earlier than in the neighbouring Parishes. The air, though in some ofthe higher grounds intensely cold, is both pure and wholesome. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, and perquisites, together with a commodious School-house, but it is in a very inconvenient part of the Parish. The great disadvantage under which it labours, is the distance from coals : peats are generally used by the Inhabitants. Here are two lofty Hills, called Scrape, and Dollar-Burn; the latter of which is supposed to be 2840 feet above the level ofthe sea. There is a Roman Camp, which is pretty entire : and near it were discovered, some-years ago, a Roman urn, and some ancient coins. At a small distance from this Camp, there is an ancient Tower situate upon an eminence, and commanding the best view in the Parish : and which probably served as a Watch-tower, to give sig nals of alarm, when the enemy made inroads upon the country. Robert the Third granted to Sir William Inglis the Barony of Manor, to hold blanche of the Crown ; in consideration of his victory over Thomas Struther, an English man, in single combat ; reserving, however, to Sir William Gladstanes, the lands which he possessed in the same Barony, with the old Superiority.

It is 7 m. N. from Kirkaldy. This Parish contains about 7000 acres ; the greatest part of which is exceedingly fertile, and well cultivated. The climate is cold, but not unhealthy. It is watered by the rivers Leven, Lochty, and Orr, which abound with fish of various kinds. The Public Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair ; but the Cross-roads are bad; The New Inn, at Pittillock Ford, and The Plasterers, near Balbirnie Bridge, afford excellent accommodations. Coals, of a superior quality, are in the greatest plenty. The Multures are exorbitant, amounting to one-thirteenth part of the value ofthe grain carried to the mill. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a good house, and garden. On the Eastern extremity ofthe Parish, in the Farm of Duniface, which was mortified to The United College of St. Andrew's, by a gentleman ofthe name of Ramsay, for the education of four Bursars at that College, is an eminence ; upon which, are the vestiges of a fortification, called The Maiden Castle. On the Post road at the Southern extremity of the Parish, was an old narrow and inconvenient Bridge, which was built by Cardinal Bethune ; it was"], [395, "MAR lately taken down, and a very handsome and commodious Bridge, of three arches, built in its place.

It is in the Presbytery of Strath- Bogie, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1687, and, in 1811, was 2018. It is 8\u00a3 m. W. from Turreff. This Parish is from 9 to 10 measured miles in length, and from 4 to 5 miles in breadth. The surface is in general rather flat, being mostly surrounded with hills which are covered with heath : the river Doveron, bounds it on the South, on the banks of which the soil is a rich loam, and very fertile : towards the upper part of the country, it is wet, stony, and stiff ground. It is fully provided with good peats. There are several extensive Plantations of various kinds, all of them in a thriv ing condition. The air is pure, and healthy. The only language spoken here is Scottish. The Salary ofthe Parochial Schoolmaster is 300 merks, besides School fees, a dwelling, and a rood of land, and a few small perquisites. There is also a Charity School in Foggicloan. Great improvements are now carrying on by John Morison, Esq., of Auchintoul, whose House of Ar dmeally is uninhabited ; and who has established a manufactory in the Village of Aber-Cherder. James Rose Innes, Esq., of Netherdale ; and Alexander Ogilvie, Esq., of Culvie, are both laudably employed in the improvement of their Estates. The person of most eminence which Marnoch has produced was, Alexander Gordon, Esq., of Auchintoul, who entered into the army of Peter the Great, and by his personal valour and good conduct in the war carried on against Charles the Twelfth King of Sweden, was raised to the Rank of Major General, and wrote the history of the reign of that Prince. The new Turnpike road, from Banff to Huntley, passes through this Parish, which, with the excellent Bridge over the Doveron, makes an easy communication from the coast ; and for which, the Parish is chiefly indebted to the patriotic exertions of Mr. Morison, of Auchintoul.

MARYBURGH, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Kill-Malie. This Village is situate on the Sea-shore, on the South side of Loch EU, within a few yards to the South-West of Fort William. The place where it stands, was anciently called Auchintore Beg; and the Village was then built upon the ground,"], [397, "MAR where the Esplanade is now formed. After the accession ofthe Prince of Orange to the British throne, the Fort received the name of King William, while the adjoining Village took that of Mary-burgh, in honour of his Royal Consort. For some time past, it has been indiscriminately called Maryburgh and Gordons burgh, from the Illustrious family of Gordon, whose property it is. This is an improving place, the Inhabitants being successfully engaged in the Fisheries. A good Church was built here, about the year 1792, at the expense of The Duke of Gordon, and the Inhabitants. See, Fort William. MARYBURGH, in the Shire of Kinross ; and in the Parish of Cleish. It is 3 m. N. N. W. from Beath. At Blair Adam, the Estate of William Adam, Esq. , the present worthy Proprietor, the most substantial and patriotic improvements have been made in planting, inclosing, and raising artificial grasses. Here is a Bridge over the river Kelty. MARY CULTER, in the Shire of Kincardine : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was about \u00a375. Sterling, including the glebe, 10 acres of which have been rendered arable at a great expense by The Rev. John Glennie : Patron, Mr. Duff, of Fetteresso : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Mary, is in tolerable order. It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 710, and, in 1811, was 712. It is 7\u00a7* m. S.W. from Aberdeen. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, extending along the Southern side of the river Dee to the Grampian Mountains. The soil, on the river side, is naturally thin and sandy; on the rising midland it becomes deeper and blacker, with a bottom of clay in some parts ; but more Southward, it is swampy, and mossy. Indeed the whole Parish is so rocky, and encumbered with large stones, except some small haughs and dales near the river, that the obstacles to agricultural improvements are very great. It is in general uninclosed- There are five excellent salmon fisheries on \\A\\eDee; which is subject to heavy floods. There is a regular Ferry opposite to the Manse. In the glebe is a quarry of granite. A great portion ofthe Parish is covered with wood, both natural and planted : and in the woods of Kingcausie are some deer ofthe roe kind. The peat mosses are quite exhausted. It is with singular satisfaction the Author records, that \" the Heritors are always doing good, and contributing to the relief of the distressed.\" Potters' earth is found here. The road, along the South side of the Dee, is, in general, good. This was a residence of The Knights' Templars.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (includ ing the Villages of Luther-Moor, and Mary Kirk) was 1530, and, in 1811, was 1574. It is 6f m. N. N.W. from Montrosc. This Parish \"contains 7591 Scotch acres ; lying along the Northern bank of the river North Esk, and at the Southern extremity of Tlie How or Hollow of the Mearns. The surface is exceedingly level, and the soil, though various, is in general fertile. The appearance ofthe country is very beautiful, being interspersed with a number of handsome seats, surrounded with fine policies and plantations. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a School house and dwelling. The air is tolerably dry, mild, and temperate ; and the climate is salubrious. The great Roads are well finished, and kept in proper repair by Statute labour ; for which the Public are much indebted to the patri otic exertions of Sir Alexander Ramsay, Bart. There is no place where the Inhabitants are better supplied with good water than at Mary Kirk : the spring, and mineral waters are accounted excellent, especially one in Mary- Mill-bank, called Lady-banks- well, concerning which, many fabulous stories have been re lated. At Balmaleidie , the property of the Earl of Kintore, is a chalybeate spring, which is much resorted to. And, at Balmano, the estate of Patrick Cruikshank, Esq., is a fine Spring, called St. John's Well, which was in ancient times holden in great estimation. The chief Mansions are Inglismaldie , a Seat of Lord Halkerton, Earl of Kintore : \u2014 Balmakewan, of Thomas Gillies, Esq. : \u2014 Hatton, of Viscount Arbuthnot : \u2014 and New Thornton, of William Adams, Esq. MARY PORT, v. KIRK-MAIDEN. MARY'S, ST., one ofthe largest of The Scilly Islands. It is estimated to contain 1520 acres ; and its Resident Population, in 1810, was 1200, besides 150 in the Garrison. The climate is particularly pure, and salubrious. The hills are rocky, rising in some places to a great height, and are enriched with mineral stores ; the vallies are fertile. Fish, of various kinds, abound upon the coast. Hugh-Town is the capital ofthe Island, situate at the foot ofthe Gar rison Hill, and is furnished with a Custom-House, where a Collector, Surveyor, and four other Officers reside, under the direction of the two Principals : but,"], [399, "MAR from its low situation, it is subject to be destroyed by inundations of the sea, and by which it suffered severely in 1744. The Church stands at Church- Town, about a mile in the interior : and about a quarter of a mile from thence is Old Town, upon a sandy Bay, which contains several convenient houses. It is destitute of wood. The Harbour contains from three to five fathoms water, with good anchor age, but the entrance is difficult. It is commanded by a small Fort, called Star Castle, from the shape of its plan : which was built by Sir Francis Godolphin, Governor, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Here the Standard is hoisted daily : The Duke of Leeds commands as Governor of all the Islands, with a Lieutenant Governor, who is here commissioned by His Majesty to act under his Grace ; but as they never reside, the trust devolves upon the Captain of the Compauy, whose emoluments of office are pretty considerable. Here are several Druidical monuments. It is in the Latitude of 48\u00b0. 55. North. MARY'S, ST., in the Shire of Selkirk : a Rectory, anciently valued at \u00a313.. 6. .8.

Sterling in money, including \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is excellent ; the glebe consists of about 6 acres, of very good land : Patron, The Crown : The Church is substantial and commodious. It is in the Presbytery of Brechin, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting ofthe Estates of Old Mon trose, and Dysart) was 596, and, in 1811, was 473. It is 3| m. W. S. W. from Montrose. This Parish contains about 3000 acres of land ; the soil, on the lower grounds, is a strong deep clay, commonly called carse land : on the small ridge of hills that runs through the Parish from East to West, it is in general a very fine loam, and exceedingly fertile. The air is damp, but not unhealthy. A great variety of aquatic birds frequent The Bason, or, as it is commonly called, Tlie Back Sands of Montrose, in the winter season ; and, at stream tides, vessels of 50 or 60 tons burden can load with ease at the Harbour of Old Montrose, on the Western side of the Bason ; where coals are landed for the fuel of the In habitants, and also vast quantities of lime for manure. Of late years consider-"], [400, "M A U able quantities of Salmon have been catched, by what is commonly called Tlie Stake Net Fishing, in The Bason or Back Sands ; but the question regarding the legality of that mode of fishing depends upon the decision of a process, which is at present before The Court of Session. In the river South Esk, which is the Northern boundary ofthe Parish, there is great plenty of fish. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is between three and sour hundred merks Scotch, together with perquisites. From the summit of Mary Town Law, is one of the most beautiful prospects in Scotland. The Estate of Old Montrose was the pro perty ofthe great Family of Montrose, until the reign of Charles the Second : it then came into the possession of the famous Earl of Middleton : since which time it has passed through various hands, and is now the property of Sir James Carnegie, Bart., of South. Esk: from its name, it might be inferred, that there had been a Town here, before the present Town of Montrose was built ; but of this there are no traditionary accounts. Bonnyton, which is now joined to Old Montrose, was the Seat of the Family of Wood ; and it is only within these few years, that the remains of the old Castle fell down, but the fosse, which sur rounded\" it, is still entire. The Estate of Dysart belongs to Thomas Carnegie, Esq., of Craigo, having been purchased a few years since by his Family. MARYWELL, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen : in the Parish of Birse.

S., of October, and the second Tuesday, O. S., in December. A General Post-Office is established here. It is a neat built Town, pleasantly situate on an eminence near the river Ayr. It was formerly a Burgh of Barony, and had power to elect its own Magistrates ; but its Charter being lost, its rights have never been renewed. This Parish is about 7\\ miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern bank of the river Ayr. The soil is chiefly a rich clayey loam ; and the whole is arable, with the exception of two small mosses, and some declivities by the side of the river, which are covered with plantations. Coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, are in great abundance. The climate is wet, but not unhealthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and per quisites. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair ; particularly the beautiful bridge at Barskimming, which was built by the late Sir Thomas Miller. In 1647, there was an engagement on Mauchline moor, between the King's party and the Covenanters, in which the former were defeated. This was formerly a Priory or Cell of Cistertians, belonging to the Abbey of Melros : and when that Abbey was erected into a Temporal Lordship, the lands and barony of Kyles mure, and Barmure, and the Patronage ofthe Church of Mauchline, were given to the Earl of Loudon. The Castle, which stands in the Town, formerly belonged to The Ancient and Noble family of Campbell, and gives the title of Baroness Mauchline to The Countess of Loudon, who succeeded her father in 1786, and who, in 1804, married Francis Earl of Moira : In 1789, it went by purchase to Gavin Hamilton, Esq. ; when Mr. Grose took a view of it.

It is in the Presbytery of Selkirk, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (in cluding the ancient Parish of Rutherford) was 368, and, in 1811, was 438. It is 6 m. S. E. from Melros. This Parish is nearly 4 miles in length, and about 3 miles in breadth. It lies along the South bank of the river Tweed; and the soil is partly a stiff clay, and partly a light loam : much attention is paid to agriculture, by the spirited exertions of Adam Walker, Esq. ; but the great distance from coals, and lime, is severely felt. Here is a good Schoolhouse, and the master enjoys the legal Salary of 300 merks. Upon the estate and farm of Little-Dean, there are the remains of an old Tower, which was formerly a place of some strength : it was long the residence of the Kers, of Little-Dean, and still belongs to that ancient Family ; who have also a vault, adjoining to the Church of Maxton, where they continue to bury, and have done so, for many generations. Upon Rutherford Common there are the remains of a Roman Camp, on a rising ground, not far from the banks ofthe Tweed, called The Ringly Hall, from its circular figure ; upon the opposite side of that river, is a deep hollow, called The Scots Hole, in which, according to tradition, the Scots were encamped, while the ancient Roman camp was possessed by the English : they were some days in this situation, with the Tweed only between them ; when, at length, the English, being superior in numbers, ventured to ford the Tweed, at a place where the Village of Rutherford now stands, and the Scots met them on a rising ground, on the opposite side, which is still called Tlie Pleabrae: an ob stinate battle ensued, in which the English were worsted, many of them slain, and interred in the Burying-ground at Rutherford : from this battle, the place was called Rue-the-Ford, on account ofthe great loss sustained by the English, in fording the Tweed, to attack the enemy : the time of this battle is not known. \u2014 The Lands, and Barony of Rutherford, belong to Sir Alexander Don, Bart., of Newton, the representative of a very ancient and respectable Family in Tlie Merse. \u2014 Near the Border, betwixt the Parishes of Maxton and Ancrum, is the ridge of a hill, called Lilliard'sEdge, formerly Ancrum Muir: where a dreadful battle was fought in 1543, between the Scots and English, soon aster the death of King James the Fifth, when the Earl of Arran was Regent of Scotland: Sir Ralph Rivers and Sir Bryan Laiton, coming to Jedburgh with an army of 5000 English to seize upon Merse and Teviotdale, in the name of Henry the Eighth,"], [403, "MAX then King of England, the Regent and the Earl of Angus advanced with a small body to oppose them : The Earl of Angus, it is said, being greatly exasperated at the English, because, some time before, they had defaced the tombs of his ancestors at Melros, and had done much injury to the Abbey there : the Regent and the Earl of Angus, without waiting for the arrival of greater force, which was expected, met their enemies at Lilliard' s Edge, where the Scots obtained a great victory, considering the inequality of their number : a young woman, of the name of Lilliard, fought along with the Scots, with great courage, but was unfortunately slain ; in memory of which, a Tomb-stone was erected over her grave, in the field of battle, with this doggerel Inscription : \u2014 \" Fair Maiden Lilliard lies under this stane, \" Little was her stature, but great was her fame ; \" On the English\\a,ds she laid many thumps, \" And when her legs were off, she fought upon her stumps.\" Some remains of this Tomb-stone are still to be seen : it is near a Roman Road, which runs about two miles through the Parish of Maxton on its West side, proceeding from the river Jed on the South, towards the foot of the Eildon Hills on the North. MAXWELL, or MACCUS-VILL, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh. This Parish is now included in the Parish of Kelso. There was anciently here, South ofthe Teviot, and nearly opposite to Roxburgh Castle, a,Mai son Dieu, for the reception of pilgrims, the diseased, and the indigent. The site of this House is well known ; and upon the spot where it stood, there is a Ham let, which still bears the ancient name. To this establishment, the charity of David the First granted a carucate of land, in Ravendene. In 1296, Nichol de Chapelyn, the guardian of this House, did homage to Edward the First. It belonged to the Monks of Kelso ; together with the Chapel of Harlaw, that stood at a farm, called Chapel, about a mile from Maxwell. The Chapel of Harlaw appears to have been founded in his court by Herbert de Maccuswell, and by him dedicated to St. Thomas the Martyr, according to the practice in the reign of William the Lion. In 1389, Richard the Second granted to Allan Horsle, and his heirs, the Vills of Maxwell, and Softlaw. Robert the Second granted to John de Maxwell the lands of Softlaw, in the Barony of Maxwell. The Church of Maxwell was a Rectory, and was anciently valued at \u00a311.. 16..8. 3D2"], [404, "MAY per annum, when the Monks of Kelso were in possession. It formerly gave the titie of Baron to the family of Maxwell, attainted in 1715. MAXWELL-TOWN, formerly BRIDGE-END, in the Stewartry of Kirk cudbright ; and in the Parish of Troquere. This Village is situate on the Western side of the river Nith, contiguous to the Bridge of Dumfries ; and is so named from the Proprietor of it, and its local situation. It contains many beggars, who are loudly and justly complained of. Here is a School, with a Salary of \u00a32..10..0. ; besides which, there are three other Schools, for teaching young children the first rudiments of education ; the master of one of them receives 10s. yearly from the Session ; the other two teach for School vVages. The Resident Population, in 1791, was 1302. MAXWELTON, in the Shire of Renfrew ; and in the Parish of The Abbey of Paisley. It is \\ m. S. W. from Paisley. This is a very neat little Village, erected since the year 1746, and has a considerable manufacture of silk gauze. MAYBOLE, or MINNIBOIL, in the District of Carrick, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Collegiate Church, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 63 bolls and 2 pecks of meal, and \u00a373.

It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Sy nod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, aud Parish, in 1801, was 3162, and, in 1811, was 3946. It is 84^ m. SW. b. W. from Edin burgh. It is pleasantly situate on a small eminence, and is defended from the Northerly and Easterly winds by a range of high hills, which surround it in the form of an Amphitheatre. It is well supplied with excellent water, and is noted for the health and longevity of its Inhabitants. It was erected into a Burgh of Barony in favour of The Earl of Cassillis, by a Royal Charter dated at Edin burgh on the 14th of November 1516. The principal manufacture is that of blankets ; which are sold at the four annual Fairs, holden in the Town. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and a house, and garden. A General Post-Office is established here. The Col legiate Church of Maybole, now in ruins, was founded in the year 1441, by Sir Gilbert Kennedy, of Dunure, ancestor to The Earl of Cassillis, for a Provost or Rector, and three Prebendaries ; and was consecrated in honour of The Blessed Virgin Mary: the area within is now used for the Burying place of the Family of Cassillis. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. The Parish of Maybole is"], [405, "M E A about 12 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth. On the banks of the rivers Doon and Girvan, there are many excellent Farms ; but the surface is in general mountainous, and appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The old House of Cassillis, one ofthe seats of The Earl of Cassillis, is pleasantly situate on the banks of the Doon, and is surrounded with beautiful Policies, and extensive Woods : here are many Family portraits, and divers other paintings. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. MAYEN, v. FORGUE. MAYEN, v. ROTHIEMAY. MAY ISLAND, off the coast of Fife. This small Island is situate in the mouth ofthe Firth of Forth, and is 6 m. S. E. from Anstruther Wester, and the same distance from Crail. It is about a mile in length, and three quarters of a mile in breadth ; being very precipitous to the West, but shelving gradually to the East: and affords excellent pasture for sheep. Here is a Well of fine water, and a small Lake. There are the ruins a Priory, which was founded by David the First, and formerly belonged to the Abbey of Pittenweem ; and of a Chapel, which was dedicated to St. Adrian, whose shrine was much resorted to in cases of barrenness. Here is a Light-House, erected upon a Tower 45 feet high, in the reign of Charles the First ; for the support of which, two-pence per ton is exacted on all vessels passing this Island ; and, in 1791, this revenue was let at \u00a3970. Rabbits breed here in considerable numbers ; and, during the sea son of incubation, it is frequented by a great variety of aquatic fowls. The Island of May has always been considered, quoad sacra, since the Reformation as part of the Parish of Crail. It is in the Lordship of Pittenweem : and in the Latitude of 56\u00b0 16' North. MAYNE, in the Shire of Inverness : and in the Parish of Killtarlaty. It is 8 m. S. W. from Beauly. Here are three Farmer Villages, consisting of a few Houses called East, West, and Mid Mayne. It is situate by the South side of the river Beauly, where the rocks are very extensive, and rugged : the large blue Hawk, one ofthe most ravenous birds in this Country, nestles here. MEADOWBANK, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Paisley, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Newton) was 1714, and, in 1811, was 1941. It is 3 m. N. W. from Eaolesham. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 3| miles in breadth. The soil is light and early : and it is noted for the excellence of the pasture lands, and the produce of the Dairy. The heritors are numerous ; several of whom are resident, and have excellent modern Mansions on their estates ; and are exemplary and active in promoting a spirit of industry and improvement around them. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with the usual small School-fees and perquisites, and a large garden. The roads are good. There are neither free-stone, lime, nor coals in the Parish ; but all these may be procured in plenty at no great distance. The old Castle of Mearns, now in ruins, is the property ofthe Family of Stewart, of Blackhall. MEARNS, THE, v. KINCARDINE, SHIRE. MEGDALE, v. WESTER-KIRK. MEGGET, in the Shire of Peebles ; Here is neither Church, nor Chapel ; Divine Worship is, therefore, performed in the different farm-houses by rotation, which is far from being either decent, or convenient : At Henderland, in the Eastern extremity ofthe Parish, there are the ruins of a Church, which is sur rounded by a Cemetery, that is still in use ; and, as there are no other remains of any Ecclesiastical Edifice, this may be supposed to have been the ancient Church of Megget : the inscription on the Tomb-stone of the famous freebooter, Cockburn, of Henderland, is still legible. It is 14 m. S. b. W. from Peebles. The Parish of Megget is between six and seven miles in length, and nearly six miles in breadth. The surface is very uneven. The summits of the hills are, in general, covered with heath, and coarse grass ; but the lower parts produce ex cellent pasture both for sheep and cattle. The climate is not upon the whole unhealthy ; though from the elevated situation of the country, it is damp and cold. The water of Megget rises at the head of the Parish, and, after running the whole length of it, falls into St. Mary's Loch, a beautiful expanse of fresh water. The Marquis of Queensberry is Proprietor of the whole ofthe two Parishes of Megget, and Lyne, except the Farm of Henderland, and a small Heritage, called Lyn-Townhead. Lord Henderland, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, is Proprietor of the former, and takes his title from that Farm. Boethius, Buchanan, and other Historians, inform us, that gold was formerly found in Glengaber Water, and some small traces still remain of the"], [407, "M E I researches which had been made in pursuit of that precious metal. The want of a School at Megget is severely felt, as there is no School of any kind nearer to it, than that at Yarrow, which is 8 or 9 miles distant. The great distance from Lyne Church, being about 14 miles, is also a particular inconvenience ; as the river Tweed runs between them, and the Road is remarkably bad, and steep. A passable road up Manor water, is much recommended. See, Lyne. MEG-HILL, v. GALA-SHIELS. MEIDHOPE, CASTLE, v. ABERCORN.

This Parish is about A\\ miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth, lying in the extensive plain of Strathmore. The soil is fertile, and well cultivated. It is watered by the rivers Isla, and Dean, which unite about half a mile North-West from the Town : and in the neighbourhood, there is a Ferry-boat on the Isla, in the road from Dundee to Alyth. The Town of Meigle is ancient, and is pleasantly situ ate on a rivulet ofthe same name. The Market is on Wednesday. The Fairs are holden on the last Wednesday in June, and October. A General Post-Office is established here. The principal manufacture is linen ; and it has for several years been furnished with a Stamp-Office. Fuel is expensive. The climate is healthy. This Benefice was formerly annexed to the See of Dunkeld ; several of the Bishops of that Diocese resided here ; and two of them were interred in the Church : and the greater part of the Stipend of Dunkeld is paid out of this Parish. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a dwelling-house, and small garden. In the Church-yard, are the remains of the grand sepulchral monument of Vanora, said to have been the wife of Prince Arthur, of England, whose history is so much involved in fable : the monument, which is now nearly destroyed, was composed of many stones neatly joined, and decorated with a variety of Hiero glyphics, of which Mr. Pennant has preserved accurate drawings in his Tour, vol. 3. p. 178.

MELDRUM, anciently BETHELNY, in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 3 chal ders of victual, one-half paid in meal, and the other half in barley, and \u00a345. in money : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe measures between 8 and 9 acres : Patron, James Urquhart, Esq., of Meldrum, who is also Proprietor ofthe whole Parish : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presby tery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Town of Old Meldrum) was 1584, and, in 1811, was 1655. It is 3 m. N. W. from Old Meldrum. This Parish contains nearly 6000 Scotch acres. In the South part, the soil is a strong rich loam, upon clay,"], [409, "MEL and very productive ; but, towards the North, it is thinner, and less fertile. The climate is healthy. Here are several Quarries of excellent granite. The roads are very indifferent. Peats are the principal fuel. Meldrum, the elegant seat of James Urquhart, Esq., is surrounded with extensive plantations. The ancient name of this Parish was Bethelny ; the Church, and manse, being at that time situate in apart ofthe Parish, which retains that name, and where there is still a Church-yard, and Burial-place for the Family of Meldrum. The present Church was built near to the Village of Old Meldrum, with a view, it is said, to annex the Parish of Bourtie to the Parish of Meldrum, for so it has been called since this Church was built, about the year 1684 ; but this annexation did not take place. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. There is also a Sunday's School well endowed by a native ofthe place, which is highly beneficial. The only servitude here complained of, is the payment of mill multures. It gave the title of Viscount to the Noble Family of Gordon, extinct in 1631. MELDRUM, OLD, in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen: in the Parish of Meldrum. It is 139 m. N. b.

It was erected into a Burgh of Barony in 1672, and is governed by two Baillies, elected by Mr. Urquhart, of Meldrum, who is the Superior. It has a good weekly Market, and one well attended Fair on the second Tuesday, O. S., in January. The only manufacture is that of hosiery.

It is in the Presbytery of Selkirk, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2625, and, in 1811, was 3132. It is 35 m. S E. b. S. from Edinburgh. This is a considerable Town, with a weekly Market on Saturday, and four Fairs in the year ; pleasantly situate on the North side and at the foot of the Eildon Hills, and on the edge of a fertile Valley, which is upwards of a mile in length, and is intersected by the river Ttceed, that runs through it in a serpentine direction. In this valley, besides the Town of Melros, are the Villages of Daniel-Town, Darnick, Bridge-End, Gal- ton-Side, and Newstead, most ofthe Inhabitants of which hold their possessions in Feu ; as do also the Inhabitants of Eildon and Newtown, two Villages far- ther down the river, and of Blainslie, a Village on the West side of the river Lauder, which is at the Northern extremity of the Parish. A General Post- Office is established here. Before the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, Mel- ros was a Burgh of Regality, the Superiority of which was vested in the Family of Hamilton. It is now a Free Burgh of Barony, with a Magistracy, elected by the Burgesses. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and from 5 to 7 miles in breadth. The soil is various, and around the Town, it is well adapted for Orchards and Gardens. It has long been famed for the manufacture of Linens, called Melrose Land Linens, which were formerly in great demand for export- ation. In the year 1668, the weavers were incorporated by a Seal of Cause, from John Earl of Hadington, then Lord of the Regality of Melros, when the linen trade was very flourishing ; but, for several years past, it has, from a variety of causes, been very much on the decline : though this decay has been attended with a proportionable increase ofthe woollen manufactures, for which Melros is excellently situate. The Schoolmaster's Salary, and other emoluments, are about \u00a320. ; and he has also a commodious dwelling-house, and a tolerable garden. For the accommodation of the Highland part of the Parish, Mr. Robert Moffat, portioner of Threepivood, mortified, in the year 1759, the sum of 1000 merks Scotch, the interest of which is, in terms ofthe deed of mortification, ap- plied towards the maintenance of a Schoolmaster in that district There are several Roman encampments in the Parish, particularly on the North-East of the Eildon Hills : There is also another Roman Camp near the Village of New stead, which is upwards of three quarters of a mile in circumference, and is called The Chester Know or Knoll. The Name is remarkably descriptive of a"], [411, "MEL little Peninsula about a mile to the East, formed by the windings of the Tweed, which is still called Old Melrose, situate upon a lofty Promontory, but now re duced to a single house : it was famous for its ancient Monastery, founded in 664, and said to be one ofthe first seats ofthe Culdees in this Kingdom : this place was a celebrated nursery for learned, and religious men : its situation was beau tiful and agreeable : and there are still to be seen the foundations of the old wall. About a mile to the West from this Monastery, is the Village of New stead ; near which was another Abbey, called The Red Abbey. Between these, is the Bridge of Drygrange, thrown over the Tweed at its confluence with the Lauder: and near it are the handsome Houses of Drygrange, and Kirkland. A short distance from the Town, on the South side ofthe Tweed, stands the present Abbey of Melros, one ofthe largest and most magnificent in the King dom : its remains consist of some fragments ofthe cloisters, richly ornamented ; and the ruins of the Church, the Nave of which is still used for Divine Ser vice : nothing can exceed the elegance and finishing of the windows, and the beauty of the ornaments, with which this building was profusely adorned : it was founded by King David the First, in 1136, who dedicated it to The Virgin Mary, and endowed it with extensive privileges, and almost princely revenues : the Monks were of the Cistertian Order, brought from Rievaulx in Yorkshire, and it was the Mother Church of all establishments of that Order in Scotland : the Church is built in the form of St. John's Cross ; the dimensions of what is yet standing, being 258 feet in length, 137^ feet in breadth, and the circumference about 943 feet : it suffered dreadfully, during the barbarous ravages between England and Scotland : it is said, that Alexander the Second, King of Scot land, lies buried below the High Altar, and that an inscription once denoted his tomb : on the South side of the High Altar is a marble monument, which is sup posed to be that of Waldevus or Walter, the second Abbot, who was canon ized : many of tlie noble line of Douglas also lay here ; among whom is James, the son of W illiam, Earl of Douglas, who was slain at the battle of Otterburn, and interred here with all the pomp that either the military or the religious pro fession could bestow. The Lord of Liddisdale, who was styled \" The flower ofChvalry,\" de Valoniis, Vauxs, Somerviles, Balfours, and many other men of eminence and rank, are also interred in the Chapter-House. The late Duke of Buccleugh, the munificent Proprietor of those ruins, directed a new Church to be built for the Parish, and The Abbey to be preserved for the public admira tion : which, upon the whole, is the most beautiful ruin in Scotland, and affords, 3E2"], [412, "MEL as Mr. Grose observes, more specimens of Gothic ornament than are any where else to be met with. On a part ofthe Parish of Melros, which lies im mediately contiguous to the Parish of Gala-Shiels, several Dwelling-houses were built by Mr. Scot, of Gala, some years ago, for those families which removed thither from Gala-Shiels, for the sake of getting feus, in a spot more convenient for carrying on their business. \u2014 According to Mr. Chalmers, the ancient name of the Parish of Melros, was Fordel. But, upon the re-establishment of the Monastery of Melros, in 1136, the name ofthe old Monastery was transferred to the new ; and has, in the progress of change, entirely superseded the ancient appellation of Fordel, which, however, was confined rather to the Village, than to the Church, that stood near the prior establishment. Aster the re-founding ofthe Religious House, the Annals ofthe Abbey, and the History ofthe Parish, were the same, until recent times. There were of old, three Chapels in this Parish ; one, at the Village of Galton-Side, on the North bank ofthe Tweed ; another at Colms-lee, on the Alan water, where the Monks had their Dairy ; and the third, lying in the Northern extremity ofthe Parish, was called Chield helles Chapel: \u2014 The Chapel of Galton-Side must have been appurtenant to some Manor, if we may determine from its materials of free-stone, and its regu larity of architecture : \u2014 The Chapel of Colms-lee was dedicated to the far-famed founder of Iona Abbey, St. Columba, the ruins of which may still be traced : \u2014 The Chield-helles Chapel was a handsome structure of hewn stone, and the place, where it stood, still bears its name. In 1460, James the Third, when yet an infant, was crowned here. After the Reformation, the Town, Monastery, and Regality, came, by a grant from the Crown, lo Sir Thomas Hope, who preferred, however, the title of Hadington. By several transmissions, this Re gality came into the Family of Buccleugh ; and, in 1747, on its abolition, the Lady Isabella Scot, received \u00a31200. as a compensation for her rights.

In 1633, the Parish of Melville was sup pressed ; and the Barony of Melville, forming the greater part of it, was united to the Parish of Laswade ; while the Barony of Lugton, forming the smaller portion, was annexed to Dalkeith. It is 1 m. W. from Dalkeith. The ancient family of Male-ville ending in a female heir, Agnes, she gave her possessions, with her person, to Sir John Ross, of Halkhead : the descendants of this mar riage acquired the Peerage of Lord Ross, from James the Fourth : and the"], [413, "MEL Barony of Melville remained with William, Lord Ross, in 1705. It was pur chased in the Seventeenth Century, by David Rennie, whose daughter carried it by marriage to The Right Honourable Henry Dundas ; who, on the 24th of December 1804, was created Viscount Melville, after long executing the high est Offices in the State. Melville Castle, the Seat of His Lordship, is an elegant building, in the Gothic style, after a plan of the late Mr. Adam : it is built on the site ofthe old House of that name, which, tradition erroneously says, belonged to David Rizzio, and was occasionally inhabited by Queen Mary : \u2014 \" MelvilFs tow'rs, sae white and stately, Dim by gloamin glint to view, \" Thro' Laswade 's dark woods keek sweetly, Skies sae red, and lift sae blue,\" Macniel. The late Viscount Henry, it is well known, underwent along and serious Im peachment, in 1806 ; of which he was honourably acquitted. The esteem in which his merits, and family, are holden in Scotland, may be seen from the Speech of The Right Honourable William Calder, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, to The Right Honourable William Dundas, on his election as Member of Parliament for that City, in the room of Sir Patrick Murray, Bart., who vacated his Seat: \u2014 \" Mr. Dundas, \" It is with much satisfaction that I have now to inform you, that the Electors of the Capital of Scotland have made choice of You to be their Repre sentative in Parliament. A long connection has now subsisted between the City and the Family of Arniston. Indeed, a Family so remarkable for eminent talents, for generations, marked them for distinction, and the City of Edinburgh has not been blind to their merits. Your Uncle, whom I scruple not to call The Great Lord Melville, represented the City for many years ; I believe he was gratified with the appointment, and his Constituents had reason to be proud of their Representative. 1 will not hesitate to say, That he was the best friend that Scotland ever saw. We rejoice to see his son (The Right Honourable Viscount Robert, First Lord of the Admiralty) emulating his talents and his usefulness, and You, Sir, his Nephew, also rising to importance in the State.

The distance from coal, aud lime, is a serious inconveni- ence, as both of them must be driven 26 miles. It appears from the description of The Abbey of Dryburgh, by The Earl of Buchan, that so early as the year 522, St. Modan, one of the first Christian Missionaries in Britain, was Abbot of Dryburgh, and in the neighbourhood of Stirling and Dumbarton, his memory is still to be traced. It is probable, that the Abbot and Monks of this place were soon after transferred to Melros, since no mention among the early Historians is made of them aster this time, so that some centuries undoubtedly elapsed before their re-establishment at Dryburgh. About the middle of the Twelfth century, Hugh de Morville, Constable of Scotland, with the consent of his wife Beatrix de Bello Campo, became the Founder of a new Abbey here, in the reign of David the First, who granted a charter of confirmation, in which he assumes the name of Founder, although it is sufficiently apparent from the Chroni- cle of Melros, that it owed its origin to the former persons. It received sub- sequent benefactions from several Illustrious Personages. About the year 1556, David Erskine, a natural Son of the Lord Erskine, became Abbot ; he was one ofthe Sub-preceptors to James the Sixth, the Monarch who aster- wards dissolved this Abbey, and bestowed it as a Temporal Lordship under the Title of Cardross, on John Earl of Marr, and Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, (in 1606), with the Privilege also annexed of assigning that Title of Peerage, in 1615 : And which singular right he made use of by con- veying it to Henry, his third son, ancestor of the present Earl of Buchan, by a deed dated the 13th of March, 1617, and this assignation was confirmed by the King and Parliament. In 1544, the Market Town of Dryburgh was all burnt down, except the Church, by the English army, under Sir George Bowes : and, in the subsequent year, the Monastery was plundered and burnt by the obdurate fanaticism of The Earl of Hertford. The Church of Mertown belonged to the Canons of Dryburgh, till the Reformation. In 1786, this Abbey was purchased by The Earl of Buchan from the Heirs of Colonel Tod, who bought it from Haliburton, of Newmains, the Heir of the ancient family of Haliburton, of Mertown, a very old Cadet ofthe Oue/Tamily of Halyburtons, of Pitcur, and of Halyburton, of Halyburton. \u2014 It is distant four miles from Melros, and is beau- tifully situate on the banks ofthe Tweed, embosomed in trees, in a retired and agreeable country. Of this once interesting place, there are less remains than are to be met with in other Ruins, for which this part of Scotland is celebrated ; but, under the auspices of the present Noble possessor, who resides in a house"], [417, "MET with very pleasant gardens closely adjoining to it, further dilapidations are not to be feared. The Nave of the Church is almost wholly demolished, and nothing but the foundations of the Pillars remain. The most considerable part that re mains is the North Transept, attached to one of the Pillars which supported the Tower ; with respect to the remaining parts, the Refectory has fallen down of late years, being standing when visited by Mr. Pennant, in 1769 ; now only the gable ends are to be seen, in one of which is a curious radiated Window, similar to that at Jedburgh, but scarcely visible from the Ivy surrounding it. The Earl of Buchan, who is particularly charmed with this agreeable spot, has fitted up one of the ruined apartments in an appropriate style of architecture. These ruins present a venerable appearance from the opposite side of the Tweed, whose banks are of a red earth, and uncommon steepness. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of this famous Abbey ; and it is further commemorated, in two plates, by the taste and judgement of Mr. Caley and Mr. Moore. This Parish is highly indebted to Mr. Scott, for the substantial improvements in agriculture which he has introduced, and for the beauty of his plantations and pleasure grounds, at Harden.

It is 1 m. S. from Leven. It is pleasantly situ ate on the Northern coast of the Firth of Forth, and has a good harbour, which was erected by David Earl of Wemyss, about the year 1650 ; but which was several years ago almost demolished by a storm. In the neighbourhood are very extensive Collieries, and Salt-works, between which a waggon-way has been conducted to the Pier, where vessels are loaded with great convenience.

The Barony of Methven was formerly part of the Dowery lands usually appropriated for the maintenance of the Queen Dowager of Scotland, together with the Lord ship and Castle of Stirling, and the lands of Balquhidder, all of which were settled on Margaret (the eldest daughter of Henry the Seventh of England), Queen Dowager of James the Fourth; who, afterwards marrying Henry Stewart, procured a Peerage for him, under the title of Lord Methven, iu 1528 : and, on"], [419, "M I C this occasion, the Barony of Methven was dissolved from the Crown, and erected into a Lordship, in favour of Henry Stewart and his heirs male, on the Queen's resigning her jointure ofthe Lordship of Stirling. In 1540, the Queen died at the Castle of Methven ; and was buried at Perth, beside the body of King James the First. In 1584, the Lordship of Methven and Balquhidder was conferred on Lodowick Duke of Lennox, in whose Illustrious Family it continued until it was purchased, in 1664, by Patrick Smyth, of Braeo, great Grandfather ofthe present Lord Methven, from Charles, the last Duke. While this estate re mained in the Crown, various portions of it were granted in feu to different per sons ; and the feu duties of these lands are now paid to Lord Methven, as Pro prietor of the Lordship, although the lands are holden ofthe Crown. Here Robert Bruce, soon after his Coronation, in 1306, was defeated by the English army under the command of Aylmer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke. In 1433, a Collegiate Church was founded here by Walter Stewart, Earl of Athol, who amply endowed it with lands and tythes, for the salvation of his soul ; having, it is said, been a principal actor in the horrid murder of King James the First, his own nephew. It consisted of a Provost, and five Prebendaries: and an Aisle, which was connected with it, is now the Burial-place of the Noble Family of Methven.

Its name is derived from the early and luxuriant verdure on what is called The Bank Head, in the Spring months. Here are the ruins of an ancient Tower, which belongs to Sir John Sinclair, Bart. MICHAEL'S, ST., in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife : an ancient Parish, now comprehended in the Parish of Cupar. The Church, which is com pletely demolished, formerly stood on that beautiful spot, now known by the name of St. Michael's Hill. This small Parish is situate on the South side ofthe river Eden. MICHAEL'S, ST., ISLE, off the Southern coast of The Isle of Man. It is 3 m. E. b. N. from Castle-Town. In this little Island, a Fort was erected by one ofthe Earls of Derby, with a view of defending the entrance of Derby Haven: this Tower is now falling to decay, but part of the Derby Arms may still be 3F2"], [420, "M 1 D traced over the entrance, dated 1667.

MIDDLEBIE, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, with the an cient Parishes of Carruthers, and Pennersaughs united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of victual, \u00a366.. 13.. 4. in money, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Com munion elements : the manse is in good order : the glebe consists of 12 acres : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Annan, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1507, and, in 1811, was 1683. It is 2\\ m. N. E. from Eccles-Fechan. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and A\\ miles in breadth. The surface is flat, interspersed with gentle eminences ; and the soil, upon the whole, is tolerably fertile. The air is generally moist. It abounds with free stone of a reddish colour ; and with lime-stone, which is worked to a great extent both for the purposes of building, and for manure. The principal disadvantages of this Parish are the scarcity of fuel, and the wetness ofthe soil. The roads are good. From the etymology ofthe name it appears, that Bie signifies a Station; and that the addition, Middle, has been given to it from the circumstance of its being the Middle Station between Netherbie in Cumberland, and Overbie or Up perbie in the Parish of Esk-Dale-Muir ; at both of which places, as well as at Middlebie, are distinct vestiges of a Roman Station ; especially at Birrens, which is supposed to have been the Blatum Bulgium of Antonine's Itinerary : it is situate on a commodious flat, upon the Northern bank of the small river Mein, having on its East side a rivulet, which here joins the Mein; it is of a rectangular form, and is surrounded by five earthen ramparts, and four fosses, a part whereof have been carried away by the floods ofthe river, that once formed its ornament and strength. General Roy has given a plan, and section of this station, pi. 24. Here the Statue ofthe Goddess ofthe Brigantes, that of Mercury, with the altar dedicated to him, as well as several other curious antiquities were discovered; and of which the late Sir John Clerk has given a description.

This Parish, including part of The Hill of Fare, contains about 9780 acres ; of which, 3500 are under tillage, 940 are appropriated to pasture, 210 are planted, 584 are moss, and the remainder are muir. The surface is in general level ; the only eminence deserv ing notice being The Hill of Fare, which is elevated 1793 feet above the level of the sea, and affords excellent pasture for numerous flocks of sheep. Game, of various kinds, are in the greatest abundance. The climate is particularly healthy. Here are three Druidical circles, and several cairns. The Vale of Corrichie, near the Southern boundary, is well known as the scene of a battle fought there during the reign of Queen Mary, wherein the contending parties were headed by The Marquis of Huntley (who fell in the engagement), and The Earl of Murray. This Parish gave birth to Mr. William Meston, late Professor of Philosophy in The Marischal College of Aberdeen, and Author of a small volume of burlesque and satirical Poems, of which a Sixth edition was published at Edinburgh, in 1767. MIGVIE, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen: an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Tarland: The Church was lately re-built ; and near it, is a Farm, called Pitten- Taggart, i. e. The Priests Croft, about 3 acres of which, together with a House and small yard, are occupied by the Minister of the United Charge, or his Sub-tenant, as glebe. It is 3 m. N. W. from Tarland. This Parish is very much detached, and moun tainous ; except a Glen, watered by the Deskry a tributary stream of the Don, which is about two Scotch miles in length, and half a mile in breadth. The soil is in general thin, and the crops often late and precarious. See, Tarland. MILBURN HOUSE, v. DALSERF. MILE-HOUSE, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Liff. The Lands comprehended under this name, were formerly called Nether Dryburgh, and those adjoining on the North and West, Upper Dryburgh ; and some per-"], [422, "M I L sons still continue to give them these appellations. A considerable Farm in the neighbourhood, has the name of Dryburgh : this quarter seems to owe its pre sent distinction to its being at the distance of a computed mile from Dundee, and from the site of a House now standing, and which happened to be among the first that were erected here. A manufacture of coarse linen has been carried on here for some years past, by Mr. James Patterson, a native of the place, and which employs a great number ofthe inhabitants. The road, from Dundee to Meigle and Cupar of Angus, passes through Mile-House, and proceeds along the whole of the North part of Liff. This village is connected with the lands of Logie on the East, being only divided from them by a Toll-bar, called Logie Toll-bar ; from thence it stretches West and North, till it joins Lochee : and in short, Mile-House and Lochee are names given to two portions of one exten sive tract of land from two to three miles in length.

This Parish is 24 miles in length, and 12 miles in breadth : the surface is exceedingly rugged, some ofthe mountains being very lofty, especially Cairns-Muir, which is elevated 1737 feet above the level ofthe sea. It is watered b\\ the river Cree, the banks of which are beautifully covered with wood ; and is navigable for small vessels for several miles into the interior; it abounds with salmon. The climate, in all the lower grounds, is mild, and healthy. Great quantities of lead are obtained in the Mountains. The Military Road, from Carlisle to Port Patrick, passes through this Parish for several miles ; besides which, there are several other Roads of great utility. Coals, and lime, are imported"], [424, "M I S from England. Sheep are the staple commodity of this Parish ; of which, it is thought, the number is not less than 30,000. There were formerly several large tumuli on the banks of the Cree ; the site whereof, according to Buchanan, pointed out the place of an engagement between the Romans and the Scots. MINTO, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a glebe con- taining 35 English acres : Patron, Lord Minto : The manse was removed to its present situation, in 1773, and is in good repair ; it is about a mile from the Church, which is neat, clean, and well seated. It is in the Presbytery of Jed- burgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 477, and, in 1811, was 514. It is 5| m. N. E. from Ha- wick. The present Parish of Minto, was fornood from the old Parish of Minto, and from a large part ofthe ancient Parish of Hassendean: it is an oblong figure, extending from East to West about 3^ miles, and from North to South about 2\\ miles : it contains 5213 acres, of which 475 are planted with forest trees. The soil is various, and well cultivated. The Harvest, in general, is early. The whole Parish is inclosed with boundary fences, and by far the greatest proportion of it is subdivided with hedge and ditch, inter- spersed with strips and clumps of planting, which serve both for shelter and ornament. The principal Roads are good. The established Schoolmaster is the only teacher within the Parish : he has a House, Garden, and an excelleut School-house, with a Salary of 300 merks, and perquisites. The air is pure. The principal disadvantage under which it labours, is the distance from fuel. It gives the title of Baron and Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Elliot, who have an elegant and commodious Mansion here. From the summit of Minto Craigs, there is a beautiful and extensive prospect of the different windings of the Teviot, and the adjacent country, for many miles round : here are the re mains of a square Tower, of which Mr. Grose has preserved a View. Four Cottages have been built at Deans oot, since the year 1801, all of which are now (in 1811) occupied by industrious Families. MIRESCOGE, alias BALLAMONA, in The Isle of Man. A Monastery was built here, in the year 1176, by the Abbot Silvanus, who had land given to him for it by Godred, King of Man.

W. from Wigtown. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and from 4 to 5 miles in breadth, stretching along the Eastern side of the Bay of Luce : the general appearance is diversified with plains, and rising grounds : for several miles along the coast, the soil is a fine and fertile loam ; in the centre, it is thin and stony ; and on the West side, there is a great extent, consisting mostly of rocky eminences or mossy swamps and lakes, exhibiting a bleak and barren aspect, and is chiefly used for pasture. The climate is remarkably healthful. The coast abounds with a variety of excel lent fish. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites, and a very neat School-honse ; and it is well conducted by an able and assiduous Master. There are the vestiges of two old fortifications ; and close to the shore, are the ruins of a small manse, and Church, called St. Finian's Chapel. In the middle ofthe moor-land, is a very picturesque and an cient Castle, called The Old Place of Mochrum ; it formerly belonged, together with a considerable estate contiguous to it, to an ancient family ofthe name of Dunbar, who resided there, and were created Knights of Mochrum, which title they still enjoy ; but the Castle, and the Estate, have long been in the possession of The Earl of Dumfries, who has made several extensive Plantations. Merton House, is the elegant Residence of Sir William Maxwell, Bart., of Monreith ; whose liberal and patriotic plans in the improvement of his large Estate, are most exemplary and deserving of the highest commendation. MOFFAT, partly in the Shire of Dumfries, and partly in the Shire of Lan ark : formerly a Rectory, and Mensal Church, to the See of Glasgow : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., in money: the manse, though small, is a very sufficient, and well executed building : the glebe consists of 12 acres : Patron, The Earl of Hopetoun : The Church is a large plain edifice, lately erected, and is completely fitted up on a regular plan.

The Village of Moffat is pleasantly situate near the banks ofthe Annan, at the head of an extensive valley, and is encompassed on all sides, except the South, by hills of different heights, partly inclosed and cultivated, and partly planted : the Street is wide and spacious, and being kept exceedingly clean and well gra velled, affords a most agreeable walk. The Lodging Houses are excellent. The climate, though rainy, is remarkably healthy. Fuel is expensive. There are two Mineral Springs in the Parish ; both of which are well known, and justly cele brated for their medicinal virtues : \u2014 the first has long been distinguished by the name of Moffat Well, and is a strong Sulphureous water ; it is about a mile and a half from the Village, from which there is a good carriage road, with conve nient accommodations at the Well, for the use ofthe company, while drinking the water : \u2014 the other Spring is known by the name of the Hartfell Spaw, and is four miles distant from the village ; it is a powerful Chalybeate, and is used with great efficacy : it was discovered in 1748, by John Williamson, an eccentric but benevolent character, over whose grave a monument was erected in the old Church-yard, by his Friend and Patron, the late Sir George Max well, Bart., to transmit his name, and the date ofthe discovery to future ages. As an additional inducement to the Invalid to repair to Moffat, a considerable number of Goats are kept in the neighbourhood ofthe Well ; the pasture is thought to be excellent, and the milk of the best kind ; it is sent new to the Village every Morning, and Evening : or, it may be procured at the Farm-house, where it is m *ked, close to the Well, from the first of June to the end of August. ** \u00a9 The principal part ofthe Parish of Moffat lies in the Stewartry of Annandale, wdiich is now united to the Shire of Dumfries ; The Village of Harthope, and the adjacent Farms, belong to the Shire of Lanark, and are under the Civil Jurisdiction of that County : its greatest length, from East to West, is about 18 miles, and its breadth from North to South, is about 11 miles. The surface is, in general, very mountainous ; the most elevated land being that of Hartfell, which is upwards of 3300 feet above the level ofthe sea. It is watered by the rivers Avon, Moffat, and Annan, which join near the Southern boundary of the District, and the united streams from thence bear the name of Annan to the Solway Firth : the Clyde, and the Tweed, both of which are well known in Song and in the Annals of Commerce, have also their sources a little to the Northward of the Village. Upon the banks ofthe Annan, and the Moffat, there"], [427, "M O F is a considerable extent of meadow and arable land ; the soil of which is a mix ture of clay, sand, and loam, that has been washed down, in the course of ages, from the higher grounds. Game, of various kinds, are abundant. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. There are many large and thriving Plantations, made by the late Sir George Clerk Maxwell, which do honour to the judg ment and taste of that public-spririted Gentleman ; and have rendered a place, formerly bare and bleak, one of the most delightful spots in Annandale. The Earl of Hopetoun has likewise made several considerable Plantations, to the North and West of the Village, which are a great ornament to the place, and are a splendid example of his Lordship's zeal and patriotism. One half of the Parish belongs to The Marquis of Annandale, and The Earl of Hopetoun ; there are eleven or twelve other Heritors, and there are many feuers in the Vil lage. Near the Village, is a House of The Earl of Hopetoun, in which His Lordship frequently resides ; and, about a mile and a half South-South-East from Moffat, is Dumcrief the delightful Seat of the late benevolent James Currie, M. D., of Liverpool, well known as a Medical writer, and as Editor of the last edition of Burns's Poems, and as the Author ofthe celebrated letter, coiar. mercial and political, to Mr. Pitt, published in 1793 under the assumed name of Jasper Wilson. Loch Skeen, is the only Lake in the Parish ; from whence issues a considerable rivulet, which, after running nearly three quarters of a mile, falls from one precipice to another, from a great height, and forms the beau tiful cascade, known by the name of The Grey Mare's Tail. The Roman Road, from Esk to Stirling, passed through part of this Parish, to the West of the Vil lage ; the vestiges of which, and of some military Stations near it, are still vis.ble. Some large Roman encampments may also be distinctly traced in the neighbour hood : and a piece of gold was discovered, some years ago, in a moss not far from the road, supposed to be part of a military ornament, marked with the number of the Legion to which it belonged. About three miles South-East from the village, near Moffat water, are the vestiges of an encampment, which is conjectured to be British. Near the Road to the Well, is a Moat of considerable height, of a conical form, with a deep ditch round it ; and being inclosed and planted by Lord Elliock, upon whose property it stands, is a beautiful object : at a few hundred yards West from it, is another Moat of a smaller size. A mile East from the Roman road, and not far from one of the Roman encampments, are two caves, excavated out of the free-stone rock, which are capable of contain ing a number of persons, or cattle : when they were formed, or by whom, is 3G2"], [428, "M O N unknown : they are in a deep sequestered glen, and were probably designed for refuge in turbulent times : they serve at present for offices to the Farm-house, which is situate near them. There are the ruins of many old Towers in different parts ofthe Parish, but none of them appear to have been large : they are sup posed to have been used as places of security, against the invasions ofthe Bor derers, or retreats for the inhabitants, when returning from their own predatory excursions. MOIDART, a District, in the Shire of Inverness: and in the Parish of Ardnamurchan, This is an extensive District on the South West extremity of the County, with the spacious and safe harbour of Loch Moidart ; and is chiefly the property of Macdonald, of Clanranald. A very valuable Fishery might be established in this Lake. An excellent road of 34 j miles has been made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, and the great land owners, from Loch Moidart to the Bay of Saline upon Loch Sunart, to the Village of Strontian, and from thence to the Corran of Ardgour ; from whence there is a commodious and safe Ferry across Loch EU to the Military road from Fort Wil liam to the Low Country.

The District of Moll comprehended the country, on the Upper branches of Bowmont Water, which lies under the Eastern range ofthe Border mountains. The Church, and Village of Moll, stood upon the Boicmont : and there is even now, on the banks of that mountain stream, a Hamlet, commonly known by the corrupted name of Mow-haugh ; and a little lower may he seen the ruins of Mow Kirk. Moll, in the British, accord ing to Mr. Chalmers, signifies what surrounds or includes ; Moel, in the same language, signifies bare, bald, a naked hill : The Village of Moll stood near the base of Hownam-Law, a very high and naked hill, of a conical shape : and it is more than probable, from all those coincidences, that the term Moel was applied by the British Settlers here to that conical hill, and extended, by design or acci dent, to the country and village adjacent. This ancient Parish is now com prehended in the Parish of Morbottle. It is 12 m. S E. b. E. from Kelso. See, Huntlaw. MONABIA, of Pliny, v. MAN, ISLE OF."], [429, "M O N MONA CASTLE, v.

It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 852, and, in 1811, was 849. It is 1| m. S.W. from Pittenweem. This was formerly one ofthe most considerable Fishing Towns upon the coast, but since the had docks and herrings have disappeared, the fishery has much declined. The sea coast is flat and rocky ; consisting of free-stone, and lime-stone, and great quan tities of iron-stone upon the surface. There is no School-house in the Parish, but the Heritors allow the interest ofthe money appointed by law, for building a school and dwelling, to the Master, to rent one. Previous to the year 1646, the name of the Parish was Abercrombie ; since which period it has improperly acquired the appellation of St. Monance, and from the following circumstance: \u2014 The Lands of Newark, which gave the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble Family of Leslie , were formerly a part ofthe Parish of Killconquhar ; the Tythes of which (\u00a31..6..8 ) are still paid to the Incumbent of that Benefice : but, iu the year 1646, when the lands of Newark and Abercrombie belonged to two near relations of the name of Sandilands, the one bearing the title of Lord Aber crombie, now extinct, and the other Sir James Sandilands, of Newark ; they, for their convenience, having previously agreed with the then Minister of Aber crombie and a Parish by itself, applied to the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, to have the lands of Newark disjoined from Killconquhar, without prejudice lo the In cumbent, and annexed to Abercrombie ; which was accordingly granted by the Presbytery, quoad sacra: but whether any application was afterwards made to"], [430, "M O N the Lords of Plantation, and the same confirmed by them or not, does not appear: from that time, the name ofthe Parish has stood in the records of Presbytery, \" The Parish of Abercrombie with St. Monance ;\" and the Church of Abercrombie was suffered to go to ruins. The Lands of Newark con tain about 266 acres, the whole of which are inclosed, and well cultivated. Upon this estate, the property of Sir John Anstruther, Bart., is abundance of coal ; and extensive Salt-works, upon the coast, called St. Philip's. The Harbour is capable of admitting ships of burden, but the entrance is narrow, and the anchorage rocky: aud it is principally used by the Fishing boats. See, Abercrombie. MONCRIEFF, HILL,t>.

This Parish, both in length and breadth, is about two computed miles. On the banks ofthe river Scochie, the soil is partly a light loam, and partly gravelly; on the rising grounds, it is a rich loam, upon a strong deep clay; and in the places more distant from the river, it is a cold wet till, inclining to muir. Agriculture is greatly improved here of late. The air is dry, and salubrious. The rents are paid in money, and victual ; and the various servitudes of the tenants are now converted. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School -fees and perquisites, and a good School-house. There is no peat moss in the Parish ; coals are brought from Perth. Here are several cairns, and the vestiges of a Roman camp. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair : fer which the public are indebted to the patriotic exertions and liberal spirit of Mr. Graham. This Parish is noted, for having afforded an untimely grave to the fair friends, Bessie Bell, and Mary Gray, two neighbouring beauties, who are celebrated in an elegant Scotch Ballad, composed by a Lover deeply ena moured with the charms of both : one was the daughter of the Laird of Kinvaid,"], [431, "M O N the other ofthe Laird of Lednoch: a pestilence that raged in 1666, determined them to retire from tbe danger : they selected a romantic and sequestered spot, on the side of Brauchie Burn, where \" They bigged a bower on yon Burn Brae, \" And thick'd it o'er with rashes.\" Here they lived for some time, and, as should seem, without jealousy, for they received the visits of their lover, till catching the infection, they both died, and were both interred in the lands of Lednoch, at Dronach Haugh.

The House of Fintry, or Lumleythen, the Seat of James Erskine, Esq., is an elegant modern Mansion; and near where the Dighty falls into the \u00c6stuary, stands The House of Grange, the Seat of David Kerr, Esq., which still displays fine marks of ancient magnificence : both these Houses are surrounded with extensive and beautiful Plantations. On the most Southern point of the Parish, projecting into the Tay, stands the Castle of Broughty, formerly the key to the navigation of the river, and much connected with Historical events, but now in ruins. Of the Fort of Balgillo, dismantled in 1550, only a few vestiges now remain. The fisheries let for above \u00a3 1500. Sterling. The principal manufacture is the -weaving of coarse linen cloth.

Servitudes are few, and these are wearing away. Melville House is the fine Seat of the Ancient and Noble Family of Leslie', Earl of Leven and Melville, and to whom it gives the title of Baron : it was designed by the famous Sir William Bruce, and executed by Mr. James Smith, and built in 1692.

The general appearance is romantic, and hilly ; but the mountains are of less elevation than those in the neighbouring Parishes, Benchonzie, which is the most lofty, being 2922 feet above the level of the sea : the soil is light, and gravelly ; and the haughs on the banks of the Earn, which are frequently overflowed, produce rich crops. Considerable plantations have lately been made here. Game, of vari ous kinds, are in great abundance: and Glen Turret was famous, in former times, for producing falcons of the best kind, when Hawking was a favourite amusement in this Country : it furnished the pair, which the late Duke of Athol presented to The King at his Coronation in 1761, as a token of his holding The Isle of Man, of the Crown of England. The air is particularly salubrious. Coals are expensive. Ochtertyre, the elegant Seat of Sir Patrick Murray, Bart., is beautifully situate on the banks of the Lake of Monivaird.

Here are very extensive Plantations, and natural woods ; and the whole Parish has the appearance of an immense garden, being beautified with numerous seats and villas, belonging to the Merchants of Glasgow. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Canal from hence to the City of Glasgow, and the river Clyde, has been of material service to this part ofthe country, in promoting trade and manufactures. Coals, and free-stone, of excellent quality, are in great abundance : iron-stone is also in plenty, and here The Clyde Company established extensive works in 1786. There are likewise several Bleach-fields, and Print-fields.

This Parish is about 10f miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth ; and is watered by two considerable streams, one of which is tributary to the Deveron, and the other to the Ythan: by the side of these streams, the soil is deep, and fertile, but the seasons are generally late ; and the greatest part is mossy and heathy ground, with a wild and forbidding appearance. Peats, of the best quality, are in great abundance. The roads are tolerably good. At Lendrum was fought the hard contested battle of three"], [437, "M O N days, in which Donald, Lord of The Isles, received a final overthrow by the forces ofthe North, commanded by the powerful Thane of Buchan.

The Market is on Friday, and is well supplied. A General Post- Office is established here. This is one ofthe neatest, and most agreeable Towns in Scotland ; and is enlivened by a greater number of genteel Families than in most Towns of its size. It has an excellent Public Library, Assemblies during the Winter months, and a good Race Course on the adjoining Links, but the Races have been discontinued for several years past. It is pleasantly situate upon a Peninsula, on the German Ocean ; and the Town derives great advantage from a Bridge of wood, erected in 1794, over the river South Esk, by the Island of Inch Brayock. Montrose, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Aberdeen, Aber-Brothock, Brechin, and Inver-Bervie, sends one Member to Parliament. The Corporation consists of a Provost, 3 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, Treasurer, Hospital Master, 10 Merchant Counsellors, and two Counsellors from the Trades. The revenues of the Town are about to be considerably augmented, by some works of public utility which are going to be effected. The Port of Montrose com prehends within its bounds all the coast, from the Tod-Head on the North, to The Lights ofthe Tay on the South. The Harbour is one ofthe best on the East coast of Scotland, and is capable of great improvement. A considerable quan tity of salmon is taken in the two neighbouring rivers, and sent chiefly to the London Market : and, for several years, the cod fishery has been prosecuted with great success. The principal manufactures are linen yarn, and thread, sheeting, sail-cloth, and bagging, which are the staple manufactures of the County : and some years ago, James Ford, Esq., of Finhaven, erected a large fire-proof Flax spinning-mill, which is worked by steam. There are also several"], [438, "M O N rope walks, an extensive tannery, salt work, starch works, ship-building, foundery, soap works, and beer and porter breweries : and, at Hedderwick, are lime-kilns where upwards of 40,000 bolls are sold annually. The Old Town- House has been converted into the public Prison. The New Town-House, built in 1763, is a neat plain edifice, but commodious. The Public Schools, under the Patronage of The Town-Council, are deserving ofthe highest enco mium, for the excellence of their accommodation, but especially for the well deserved character which they have acquired from the great abilities and at tention of the Masters. The Lunatic Hospital is situate in the Links, at a short distance from the Town ; it was established in 1779, by the benevolent exertions of a few public-spirited individuals, particularly the late Provost Christie, and Mrs. Carnegie, of Charleton: it is capable of accommodating 55 patients, and is generally full, being designed not only for the reception of Lunatics, but also for the Indigent sick, and as a Dispensary for the relief of Out-Patients. It was lately incorporated under the name of \" The Royal Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary, and Dispensary of Montrose.\" The ancient Hospital or Maison de Dieu has been allowed to go to ruin ; but the revenues are preserved, and are under the management of The Town Council. Here is an elegant Chapel for the English Episcopalians. A few years ago, an ancient House, then converted into an Hotel, was pulled down ; which was famous for the birth ofthe celebrated Marquis of Montrose ; and in which The Pretender slept on the 13th of February 1716, the night before he made his escape to France. This was also the first Port which the French Fleet made, on the 22d of December 1715, when they had James on board ; having so far overshot the mouth ofthe Firth of Forth, for which they were originally destined. \u2014 The Parish of Montrose is about 3 miles in length, and about 2\\ miles in breadth, and contains 3080 acres of land ; the surface is nearly level for about a mile and a half from the sea : it is fertile, and well cultivated ; and is ornamented with several elegant seats, particularly Rosemounf, the Residence of John Duncan, Esq. ;\u2014 Charleton, of Mrs. Carnegie; \u2014 Neicmans- Walls, of Alexander Rennie Tailyour ; \u2014 Hedderwick, Borroufield, Dubton, Gayfield, and Kinnabar. It lies between the mouths of the rivers North and South Esk : over the former of which, there is a handsome stone bridge, and over the latter, a very long one of wood. The shore is sandy ; and the Tide of flood runs South-West. Mont rose gives the title of Duke, Marquis, and Earl to the Chief ofthe Ancient and Illustrious Family of Graham ; who also derives the title of Baron from the"], [439, "M O N estate of Kinnabar. \u2014 \" The Town of Montrose,\" says Mr. Macrie, in his Life of John Knox, p. 6. \" is distinguished by being the first place, as far as I have been able to discover, in which Greek was taught in Scotland ; and John Erskine, of Dun, is entitled to the honour of being regarded as the first of his Countrymen who patronized the study of that polite and useful language. As early as the year 1534, that enlightened and public spirited Baron, on returning from his Travels, brought with him a Frenchman, skilled in the Greek tongue, whom he settled in Montrose; and, upon his removal, he liberally encouraged others to come from France, and succeed to his place. From this private Sem inary many Greek Scholars proceeded, and the knowledge ofthe language was gradually diffused through the Kingdom of Scotland.\" \u2014 The House of Dun is four miles North from Montrose.

The Fairs are holden on the second Wednesday in February, and the third Wednesday in August. A General Post-Office is established here. Its name appears to be a compound of two Gaelic words, Monaugh, i. e. High or hilly, and Mousick, which signifies, Low and marshy ground : and the nature and situation of the country renders this conjecture more than probable, as the Parish consists, partly of Farms lying along the sides of Hills, which bound it on the West and North, and partly of low lands or haughs, which occupy a large space on both sides ofthe river Don. This Parish contains 9337 acres; of which, 3892 are arable, 2050 are under wood, 732 are pasture, and the remainder are muir and moss. Agriculture is much attended to here, chiefly by the patriotic exer tions and example of Sir Archibald Grant, the sole Proprietor ; and who re sides at his Seat of Monymusk, an elegant building, surrounded with very exten sive Policies. Game, of various kinds, are in abundance. The Roads are good. Here was formerly a Priory for Canons Regular ofthe Order of St. Augustine, founded by Gilchrist Earl of Mar, in the reign of King William the Lion, and dedicated to The Virgin Mary. It was formerly possessed by.The Culdees."], [440, "M O N MONZIE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Prebend, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 22 bolls of meal, 10 bolls of bear, and \u00a353..6..6. in money : the manse, and offices, were lately rebuilt : the glebe consists of two parts ; one of them near the manse, containing about 5 acres of good arable land ; and, the other, about a mile from the manse, upon a small eminence, containing about 3 acres of very bad ground : Patron, The Crown : The Church was built in 1685, and is well seated, and very commodious.

It is a very mountainous district, lying on the South side of the Grampian Hills ; the only habitable part being two narrow vallies, called The back and The fore Part, which are separated from each other by a ridge of lofty hills four miles broad. The soil is in general light, dry and good, but shallow : and, on the whole, not above one third part is arable ; the remainder being covered with heath, coarse grass, and moss, and appropriated to the pasturage of vast flocks of sheep. It is watered by the rivers Almond, Skaggie, and Kellie, which abound with trout ; and afford several very romantic cascades. The climate is variable, but not unhealthy. Fuel is scarce. Game is abundant. Various services are still exacted from the tenants. The principal manufacture is that of weaving linen, and woollen cloth. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites, together with School-fees, and a free house and garden.

The"], [441, "MOR Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. That part ofthe Parish, called Glen Almond, is annexed, quoad sacra, to the Chapel of Amulrie. As the ancient Caledonians and Romans continued their contests long, at the foot ofthe Gram pians, here area number of camps, forts, and similar remains of antiquity : and especially in the district of Findochs, about two miles East from the Church, there is a very large camp, and upon the summit of the hill of Dunmore, is a strong fort, which had the complete command of the passage through the mountains. There are also many cairns ; one of which is called Cairn Com hal, in memory of Fingal's father ; and it is said, that the famous Caledonian bard, Ossian, lies interred here.

The soil is light, but tolerably fertile. The Duke of Roxburgh is by far the largest Proprietor ; there are eleven other Heritors. Little more vol. ii. 3 I"], [442, "M O R than one fourth part ofthe Parish is at present under cultivation ; it is certain, however, from the traces of the plough which yet remain on the higher grounds, that much more of this, and the adjacent country, were anciently under tillage : it is generally believed, that, during the long and cruel contest between the two kingdoms, a great portion of the lands on the Borders were kept under tillage, as it was not so easy for the plundering parties, in these unhappy times, to carry off crops of grain, as it would have been, if the land had been in pasture, to drive away the cattle. The Salary annexed to the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, and perquisites, with a free house, and kail-yard. The Session- Records of this Parish commence in 1697. No register of Burials is kept. The principal source of support ofthe Poor arises from \u00a31600.. 3. .8. Sterling, which was, many years ago, bequeathed to this Parish by Mr. John More, a native of Morbotle, who acquired a fortune in the East Indies, and where he died : it was left to the management of the Heritors and Kirk-Session, and is lent out to in- terest on landed security : and it is partly owing to this fund, that the number of Poor is probably greater than it otherwise would be, as people from the neigh- bouring Parishes resort here, from a motive of being supported in their old age : a small assessment on the Parish is sometimes found to be necessary. The Inhab- itants are, in general, healthy, and many of them live to a great age. There are the remains of several encampments, and rows of stones, called Tryst- Stanes ; these Tryst-Stanes are commonly on high ground ; they are placed perpendicu- larly in rows, and not unfrequently in a circular direction : it is said, and the name also imports the same, that, in times of hostility, they marked the places of resort for the borderers, when they were assembling for any expedition of import- ance. Anciently there were two Chapels in this Parish, which were subordinate to the Church of Morbotle ; one was at Clifton, on the Bowmont Water ; the other was at Whitton, now called Nether Whitton. The ruins of Whitton Castle, and of Corbet-House, still show that they have been places of great extent and strength. The Roads in the Parish, of which none are turnpike, are very far from being good, and are often almost impassable. The chief dependence for fuel, is on coals brought from the English border, and which consequently sell at a high price. In 1228, the Church of Morbotle was declared to be a Prebend of Glasgow, yielding annually twenty merks : and, in an ordinance of the Bishop, and Chapter of Glasgow, rating the Prebends, in 1401, Morbotle is valued at \u00a35.

It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 330, and, in 1811, was 275. It is 4 m. N. W. from Berwick upon Tweed. This Parish is situate in the South- East corner of the Shire of Berwick : its borders are washed on the South by the river Whittadder, and, on the East, by the German Ocean, near which it joins the lands belonging to the Town of Berwick upon Tweed, commonly called Berwick Bounds. Its length from South to North is between three and four miles ; its breadth towards the Northern extremity is above two miles, though at one place, towards the South, it is only the breadth of the Minister's Glebe, which is all that separates the Parish of Foulden from Berwick Bounds. On the South, towards the river Whittadder, the ground is flat, and of a fertile clay soil, rising gradually towards the North where it is thin and moory ; towards the East, it is a light loam, upon a rocky bottom. The air is pure, and healthy. Fish, of all kinds, are abundant, and at very reasonable rates. Coals, and iron-ore, also make their appearance ; and immense blocks of free-stone, ofthe finest sort. The Roads are good. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks. The original extent ofthe Parishof Mordington was very small, consisting only ofthe Barony of Mordington, and the estate of Edrington, till the year 1650 ; when the Lands of Lamberton (of much greater extent than the whole of what before that period constituted the Parish) were disjoined from the Parish of Ayton, and annexed to Mordington. The celebrated Bernard de Lynton was Parson of this Church, in 1296: he commemorated the victory of Bannock- Burn, in 1314, in a Latin Poem, a fragment of which has been preserved by Fordun : in 1320, he con vened the Scotish Barons, at his Monastery of Arbroath, (of which he became Abbot, about the year 1303), where they subscribed that famous Manifesto addressed to Pope John, the Magnanimity of which has been justly admired, in every age : he died in 1333, Bishop of Sodor and Man, and was buried at Arbroath. In 1633, Sir James Douglas, the second son of William Earl of Angus, obtained from Charles the First a Grant of Over Mordington, and other lands ; and he was afterwards created Lord Mordington, a title which became extinct in 1794. It was in the Mansion-House of Mordington, that Oliver Cromwell, when he passed the Tweed for the first time, established his quar ters. Edington Castle, the ruins of which show its former strength, is situate on the summit of a steep rock, at the foot of which the river Whittadder flows. 312"], [444, "MOR On a hill, called Hab or Hob-chester, is a camp of considerable strength, which, from its form, appears to be Danish : And a little to the South-East of it, is a hill of no great height, called The Witches Know, where, so late as the beginning of the Eighteenth Century, several unfortunate women were burned for Witch craft: the spot upon which the execution took place, was plainly to be seen about fifteen years ago, but is now ploughed up and cropped with the rest of the field ; a veneration for the place, where \" innocent Human blood\" had been shed, having preserved it for so many years.

It is 2\\ m. S. E. from Hadington. This Parish contains about 1400 Scottish acres : and the property is almost equally divided between two Heritors, The Earl of Wemyss, and Miss Dalrymple. The soil is in general good, being mostly clay, with a mixture of loam ; the whole is inclosed, and well cultivated. The Schoolmaster's salary is 300 merks, besides School-fees, and perquisites. The Castle, which stood on an eminence, near the Church, is now completely demo lished ; but it was evidently of such strength and magnitude, as to have been the means of raising a considerable Village around it ; for, although there are only a few houses remaining near the site of the old foundations, yet the Village had extended much farther Westward ; as, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, a few cottages still remain, which retain the name of The West-Gate End.

It is in the Presbytery of Strath-Bogie, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Popu- lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 1876, and, in 1811, was 1767. It is 140 m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and ofthe same extent in breadth : It consists ofthe lands of Edinglassie and Glen-Marky, which are remote and disjoined from the rest ofthe Parish, of Dullan-side and a part of the Lordship of Balveny, all the property of The Earl of Fife; \u2014 of the Lordship of Auchindown, Glen-Fiddich, and the greater part of Glen-Rinnes, the property of The Duke of Gordon ; \u2014 and ofthe Barony of Kinninvie, which is, and for centuries has been, in the pos- session of a branch of the old and respectable Family of Balquhan, and of which James Leslie, Esq., the only residing Heritor, is the present most worthy and indulgent Laird. Mr. Duff, of Drummuir, has also a small estate here, called Lochend. The appearance of the country is rich and beautiful ; being variegated with hill and dale, corn land and pasture fields, and rivers which are fringed with wood in the most pleasing manner. The arable soil is, in general, a light loam, abundantly fertile ; but about one-twentieth part ofthe Parish only is cul- tivated, the remainder being coarse pasture, muir, and meadow land. It is wa- tered by the Fiddich, and Dullan, two beautiful streams, which are tributary to the Spey: and, on the South, it is bounded by the Doveron for a few hundred yards. The hills abound with all kinds of game. The air is pure and whole- some, though it is rather moist and rainy. Near the Castle of Auchindown, is a Spring of Mineral water, which, on analysis, is found to resemble the Peterhead water. Lochpark, a small, but deep Lake, is the source ofthe Isla, which flows into the Doveron in the Parish ofRothiemay: it is frequented by wild ducks,"], [446, "MOR and is said to contain large pike : it belongs to Drummuir. Among the moun tains, Bell-Rinnes towers conspicuous ; its altitude being 2650 feet above the level ofthe sea, and is a land mark for vessels sailing into the Moray Firth. The language spoken here, is an intermixture of the Scotch and English; the Erse is scarcely heard, except in Glen-Rinnes, where the Inhabitants still retain the look, manners, and genius of the Highland Caledonian. The Salary of the Schoolmaster, including fees, and a donation by William Duff, of Dipple, is about \u00a321. Sterling per annum. There are four Bursaries at The King's Col lege of Aberdeen, for boys educated here, being an endowment of \u00a3600. Sterl ing by the late Alexaner Moir, M. D., a native of Auchindown. Services \" still disgrace the rentals of some ofthe Heritors ;\" and thirlage to particular mills is also continued. A new Turnpike road is brought to this place from Banff. Fuel is scarce. Balveny House, one of the seats of The Earl of Fife, is a large and modern Mansion, but it is placed in a bad situation. The Castle of Auchindown stands on a green Mount of a conical shape, over the river Fiddich; its situation is bold and commanding ; and the centre apartment is an admirable piece of grand and Gothic architecture ; it has been in the possession of the Family of Gordon, since the year 1535, and of that name, there have been both Knights and Lords of Auchindune : before that period, it belonged to the Ogilvies, and, with all its Barony, was a part of the Lordship of Deskford. The Castle of Balveny, which is a very magnificent structure, is placed on a beautiful eminence also on the banks ofthe river Fiddich, a little below its confluence with the Dul lan: tradition calls the oldest part of it, for it has evidently been built at different times, a Pictish Tower: in days of old, it successively owned as its masters, the Cummings, the Douglasses, and the Stewarts ; and, after them, passing through several other Familes in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth centuries, it be came the property of Alexander Duff, of Braco, about the year 1687, and is now the property of The Earl of Fife : in 1444, there was a Lord Balveny, of the name of Douglas, which was forfeited in 1555 ; in the front, and high over its iron and massy gate which still remains, is a motto of the Stewarts, Earls of Athol, descriptive of the savage valour and unhappy circumstances of the times. Of both these Castles, which are now in ruins, Mr. Cordiner has pre served correct Views. There was also another old building here, called Edin glassie, and which was burned by some ofthe Highland Clans, in 1690, on their march from Strathspey, through Mortlach to Strath-Bogie ; and for which, the Laird, whose name was Gordon, took his opportunity of revenge in their return a"], [447, "MOR few weeks after, by seizing eighteen of them, and hanging them all upon the trees of his garden : there is a piece of moor -land on this Estate, called The Highlamdmens' Mossie, where, it is currently reported, they were all interred. Mortlach is famous as the scene of the signal victory gained by Malcolm the Second, in 1010, over the Danes; by which, those invaders were obliged to quit the fertile Province of Moray for ever : Upon which occasion, Malcolm, in gra titude for his victory, raised Mortlach to Episcopal Dignity ; and, in point of pre cedence, made it only inferior to St. Andrew's, whose Bishop at that time was designated Episcopus Scoti\u00e6. The See of Mortlach continued 129 years : but its Jurisdiction and Revenues were small, comprehending no more than the Churches of Mortlach, Cloveth, and Dulmeth, with all their lands : Bishop Nectan, who was the fourth and last of Mortlach, was, in his fourteenth year, translated by King David the First to Aberdeen, which soon got the name, and became the seat ofthe Diocese. Since the year 1706, this Parish has been, by an act of The General Assembly, in the Presbytery of Strath- Bogie, and Synod of Moray ; before that time, it was in the Presbytery of Fordyce, and Synod of Aberdeen : and in a connection with Fordyce, the Minister of Mortlach, it is said, has still a vote for Delegates, from that Presbytery, to elect the Professors of Divinity of King's College, of Aberdeen ; and has also some trust and manage ment, in certain lands or sums of money bequeathed to that University.

It is in the Presbytery of Penpont, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (in cluding the improving Villages of Carron- Bridge, and Thornhill) was 1255, and, in 1811, was 1570. It is 1 m. N. E. from Thornhill. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 3| miles in breadth, and contains about 6340 Scotch acres ; of which, 1800 are arable, tolerably fertile, and well inclosed: the hills are covered partly with verdure, and partly with heath and rocks. The air is pure, and wholesome. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, toge ther with a house, a Cow's grass, three roods of Croft land, and some small School-fees. The Public Roads are in good repair. The price of fuel is"], [448, "MOR moderate. It is watered by the rivers Nith, Cample, and Carron, over each of which is a good stone Bridge. The Marquis of Queensberry is Proprietor of the whole Parish, with the exception of two small Farms. The remains of Morton Castle are still very great; which, according to Mr. Pennant, was originally the Seat of Dunenald, predecessor of Thomas Randolph, afterwards created Earl of Murray by King Robert Bruce ; at which time, this Castle, together with that of Auchincass, near Moffat, were disposed of to Douglas, of Morton, predecessor ofthe Earls of Morton. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of this Castle, and erroneously adds, that the Earls of Morton had their title from this place. In the Eleventh volume of Archaeologia, p. 106, a description, and engraving, are given of its ancient octagon stone Font. See, Calder, East. MORTON HALL, v. COLLINGTON. MORVERN, or A MHOR EARRAN, i. e. The Great Division, in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : formerly aVicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a383..11..0. together with \u00a35. for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, were built in 1780 : the glebe consists of 46 acres : Patron, The Duke of Argyle : There are two Churches, at the distancce of 8 computed miles from each other, and in which the Minister officiates alternately, but they are both in very bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Mull, and Synod of Ar- gyle. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2083, and, in 1811, was 1883. It is 18 m. W. S. W. from Strontian. This Parish contains about 60,000 acres, stretching along The Sound of Mull. The general appearance is hilly, but without mountains of any remarkable height, affording pasture for great numbers of black cattle and sheep, and abounding with deer, and other game. The inhabited part is mostly along the coast, where cultivation is also principally pursued ; but the soil is poor, and light, and the crops are very pre- carious, from the heavy autumnal rains. About 70 tons of kelp are annually made upon the coast. The roads are bad. There is a stated Ferry from Ferenish to the Mull; and another from Dor lin, at the entrance of Loch Sunart, to Ardna- murchan. There are numberless fine creeks for small boats ; and, along the coast, there is scarcely a bay wherein a vessel of any tonnage may not pass a tide : besides which, Loch Aline Bay, running in from the Sound of Mull in the Southern part of the Parish, forms a safe and capacious Harbour, though it is rather narrow at the entrance, and not of easy access, unless either with a favourable tide or fair wind : but Drumby, at the mouth of Loch Sunart, and on the Morvern side, affords a safe and commodious harbour ; being formed by a"], [449, "M O U deep and clear inlet, between the Island Oronsay, and the Main-land, The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and per quisites, and a rood of land. There is also a School established by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge, with a Salary of \u00a310., besides a free house, fuel, and pasturage for a cow : The Society likewise allow \u00a36. for a spinning Mistress. Fuel is expensive. Around the whole of Loch Aline, free stone, and lime-stone, of excellent qualities, are found in great abundance. At a Farm, called Ardterinish, on the Sound of Mull, are the ruins of a Castle, where Macdonald of The Isles used to reside, and hold his Courts and Parliaments. One ofthe Scotch honours of The Duke of Argyle is Lord Morvern. See, Inversanda. MOR VINE, MOUNTAIN, v. LATHERON. MOSCROPS TOWER, v. TERREGLES. MOSSALEE, v. GALA-SHIELS.

The Tower is nearly entire, and is built, and divided in the same manner as that at Dolphiston, but is far inferior in strength.

From a passage in Mr. Ridpath's Border History, p. 635., it appears, that The Earl of Sussex, in 1570, with an English army, burnt and razed Moss Tower, then belonging to the Laird of Buccleugh ; and it is still part of His Grace's estate. A medal of the Empress Faustina was discovered in a peat-moss here.

It is 13 m. N. N. W. from Dunkeld. A great Fair is annually holden here at the end of February, for the sale of linen yarn. This Parish is divided into two Districts, Tlie Athol, and The Strath Ardle ; \u2014 the former lying on the banks of the rivers Tummel and Garry, which meet within the bounds ofthe Parish, and extending 7 miles in length, and varying from 4 to 6 miles in breadth ; \u2014 the latter comprehending Glen Briarachan, and Glen Fernat, and a part of Strath Ardle, so called from the river Ardle, which is formed by the junction of the Briarachan, and Fernat .- it extends 7 miles in length, and 6^ miles in breadth : \u2014 these two divisions, which lie in a direction nearly parallel to each other, are separated by a hill of inconsiderable height, that is about sour miles over. The greater part of the Parish is mountainous, with several high and abrupt precipices, though there are no mountains which deserve particular notice from their great elevation : the hills are almost wholly covered with heath, and are pastured by numerous flocks of sheep. In the Athol district, the soil is tolerably deep, and fertile ;\u2014 -in the Strath Ardle district, it is shallower, and yields lighter crops. The air is dry, and extremely healthy. Limestone is abundant, but very little is burned, on account ofthe dearness of fuel. Several extensive Plantations have lately been made here. The principal branch of manufacture is the spinning of linen yarn. The rate of multure paid at the mills, is one eleventh part of the victual that is ground. The Gaelic is the language chiefly spoken. The Salary ofthe Grammar School is 300- merks Scotch, of which 200 are paid by the Heritors, and 100 are given out of the confiscated lands of tlie Bishops ; together with School-fees, and perquisites, besides which the Master receives some small gratuity from^each Scholar on Handsel Monday, or Shrove Tuesday. The great Road, from Perth to Inverness, passes through the Parish, and is always kept in good repair : the cross-roads are few, but are also kept in tolerable condition. Over the Garry there is a Bridge, at the South end of The Pass of KiUicrankie, which was built by subscription in 1770, soon after the"], [451, "MOU Ferry-boat there was lost, when Eighteen persons were unfortunately drowned. Several old customs are still preserved here. Near the confluence ofthe Tummel with the Garry, is the famous Pass of Killicrankie, which is noted for the defeat ofthe Royal forces of King William, commanded by General Mackay, on the 17th of July 1689, by the adherents of King James, commanded by Graham, Viscount Dundee : the place where that gallant Nobleman fell, and with him all the hopes ofthe abdicating Monarch, still bears the name of Tomh Clovers, i. e. Mount Clavers, from that circumstance ; but it is believed, that he was af terwards carried to Blair, where he died of his wounds ; his body was interred in that Church, where, there is an elegant Latin epitaph, composed by Dr. Archibald Pitcairn. In the neighbourhood ofthe Village of Moulin, is an old Castle, said to have belonged to the Family of Comyn ; but Sir James Balfour ascribes it to Thomas, of Galloivay, Earl of Athol, and acquaints us, that it was the residence of the ancient Earls. Captain Campbell, of Finnab, well known for his gallant defence of the unfortunate Scotch Colony at Darien, and his subsequent misfortunes, was a native of this Parish. In the month of April 1809, a road extending Westward from The Pass of Killicrankie by the South side of Loch Tummel, was brought under the consideration of The Commissioners for Highland Roads, and Bridges, by His Grace The Duke of Athol, whose spirit of improvement has been so conspicuously useful at Dunkeld. The pro posed line was accordingly examined with all the care it deserves, \" and though it remains questionable,\" according to the Report of The Commissioners, \" whether the North side of Loch Tummel should not be preferred, the general utility of penetrating an extensive Valley hitherto almost inaccessible, and open ing a communication with the Southern Fairs and Markets is such, that We have readily agreed to meet His Grace's wishes in the manner which shall be found most advisable.\" By a prolongation Westward, this proposed road may hereafter be combined with the future great Drove Road of Scotland. The Earl of Dunmore is Baron Murray of Moulin. See, Kirk-Michael. MO UNT-BL AIRIE, v. ALVAH. MOUNT CAMERON, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark: in the Parish of East Killbride. It is a small eminence, about three-quarters of a mile South-East from Killbride ; and upon which is erected a neat and commodious Dwelling-house. This place, formerly called B lac klaw, takes its present name from Mrs. Jean Cameron, a Lady of a distinguished family, character, and beauty. Her zealous attachment to the House of Stuart, and the active part 3K2"], [452, "MOU which she took to support its interest, in the year 1745, made her well known throughout Britain. Her enemies, indeed, took unjust freedoms with her good name, and put the worst construction on the purest and most disinterested mo tives. Mrs. Cameron, after the public scenes of her life were over, took up her residence in the solitary and bleak retirement of Blacklaiv. But this vicissitude, so unfriendly to aspiring minds, did not throw her into despair : retaining to the last the striking remains of a graceful beauty, she spent a considerable part of her time in the management of domestic affairs : and her whole deportment was consistent with that good-breeding, unaffected politeness, and friendly gen erosity, which characterize the people of Rank in The Highlands of Scotland. She died in the year 1773, and was buried at Mount Cameron, within a clump of trees adjoining to the house. Her grave is distinguished by nothing but a turf of grass, which is now almost level with the ground. MOUNT GOWER, v. DURRIS. MOUNT-HILL, v. KIRK-URD. MOUNT-LOTHIAN, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Chapelry, now comprehended in the Parish of Penycuick : The Church stood at a Hamlet, which still retains its name, and was dedicated to St. Mary. A part ofthe lands of Mount- Lothian was granted to the Monks of Newbottle, in the Twelfth cen tury ; and this grant was confirmed to them by William the Lion : and from hence it has sometimes been called Monk Lowden: the name, in the Chartulary, being \" Monte Laodonice.\" This Parish was annexed to the adjoining District of Penycuick, about the year 1638. MOUNT STUART, v. KINGARTH. MOUNT TEVIOT LODGE, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Rox burgh ; in the Parish of Crailing.

MOUNT WHANNA, v. KILLMANY. MOUSWALD, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150..0.,0., exclusive of \u00a38..6..8. as the allowance for Communion elements : the manse is in decent repair: the glebe consists of about 15 acres : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The Church is ancient. It is in the Presbytery of Lochmaben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, (including the small Villages of Banks, Cleugh-"], [453, "MOU Brae, and Woodside) was 705, and, in 1811, was 769. It is 10 m. NW. b. W. from Annan. This Parish is a part of that District, formerly called The Stew artry of Annandale, now united to the Shire of Dumfries ; and is about 5 miles in length, and the same in breadth, including 882f acres of the Lochar Moss. The surface is mostly level ; with some rising grounds, the ascent of which is so gentle, as to permit culture to their very summits : the soil, adjacent to the moss, is wet and marshy ; the remainder is light and sandy, except two or three farms in the Eastern part, where it is a rich and moderately deep loam. The climate is healthy. There are some thriving natural Woods, and extensive Plantations, on the estate of Sir Robert Grierson, Bart., of Lag. Here are several old build ings, the most considerable of which is that at Mouswald Mains, sometimes called The Place: it was the Seat of Sir Simon Carruthers, the Laird of Mous wald, who was, what the old people called, \" a belted Knight\" his only daugh ter, it is said, married into the Queensberry Family, by which means they came into possession ofthe Estate. The Roads, and Bridges, are in excellent repair. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with a good School-house, and School-fees. In winter, there is also a private School kept in another quarter of the Parish, to which an annual Salary of between 30s. and 40s. was left by a late School-master, a native of this place. Peats are the fuel commonly used. The thirlage to the mills is light and easy: but some of the Tenants have various services still exacted from them. In the Eleventh Volume of Archaeologia, p. 106., a description, and engraving, are given of its ancient circular stone Font. The ruinous Castle of Lag, according to Mr. Grose, belongs to the ancient family of Grierson, who took their territorial designation from it. The family of Grierson is descended from Gilbert, the second son of Malcolm, Laird of Macgregor, who died in 1374: his son obtained a Charter from the family of Douglas, of the lands and barony of Lag in Nith's-dale, and of Little Dal ton in Annandale ; since which, his descendants have continued in Nith's-dale, and married into the best families of that part ofthe country. This Castle stands in a deep narrow ravine, called Tlie Glen of Lag, whence it derives its name ; it is so covered by lofty hills, as not to be seen at any considerable distance. It was anciently surrounded by a lake, which is now a marsh ; so that it must, even in its best days, have been a damp and dreary mansion ; the masonry of the Gate is executed in the rudest manner ; The last inhabitant of it, was the late Sir Robert Grierson. An old stone, formerly placed over the Gate, is now at Friars' Car se, upon which are engraven the letters I. G., and the arms of the"], [454, "M O Y fhmily. At Barnside Hill, near this place, about the end of the Seventeenth Century, Sir Robert Grierson, Bart., exercised his Prerogative as a Baron of the Regality, and Barony of Lag, by trying, condemning, and hanging, a sheep stealer. This is said to have been the last instance in Nith's-dale of a criminal suffering death by the sentence of a Baron Baillie. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of this Castle. MOY, in the Shire of Elgin: an ancient Rectory, now comprehended in the Parish of Dyke. It is 2 m. W. N. W. from Forres. This Parish being remark able for its fine level extent and fertility is, by way of distinction, called Tlie Moy, and formerly Tlie Mey. In this Plain were two distinct contiguous Estates, now vested in one Proprietor, Hugh Grant, Esq., called The Easter and Wester Mey. Each of these had a village of its own Name. In the Village and Lands of Easter Moy stood a Prebendal Church ; and the Burying-ground around it is still in use. Easter Moy is also one of those insulated Districts, which has been appended to a different County from that wherein it lies, and is subject to the Jurisdiction ofthe County of Nairn ; because it had belonged to the Thanes of Calder, while they were Hereditary Sheriffs of Nairn. MOY, or MAGH, i. e. The Plain or Meadow, partly in the Shire of Inver ness, and partly in the Shire of Nairn : formerly a Rectory, with the ancient Vic arage of Dalarossie united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 800 merks, and 50 merks for Communion elements, together with a small glebe in each Parish ; the manse was built in 1765, and is in tolerable repair : Patron, Rose, of Kill ravock: These Churches, in which Divine Service is performed alternately, are nine miles distant from each other ; the road is at all times rough, and, in the stormy season, it is frequently impassable: The Church of Moy was built in 1765, and is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Inverness, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes was, In 1801. In 1811. For that Part, which is in the Shire of Inverness. - 1321. - 1359.

This Parish is about 30 miles in length, and about 5 miles in breadth, stretching along both sides of the river Findhorn, and is strictly called Strath-Earn, a part of the ancient Earldom of Moray. The country is bleak and barren, rugged and mountainous, except some small stripes"], [455, "M O Y on each side ofthe river, where the soil is of a good quality, and, in favourable seasons, produces plentiful crops : but the climate, from the great height of the mountains, is much colder here than in the neighbouring Parishes, and the crops are liable to suffer by the lateness of the Harvest. Upwards of 12,000 sheep, 1800 black cattle, and 900 horses, are fed among the hills, which abound with game of all kinds. There is a good deal of natural wood on the banks of the river Findhorn, chiefly birch and alders : and the Laird of Mackintosh has very considerable thriving plantations of Scotch firs, mixed with forest trees, to which he is making great additions annually. Besides the rent in money, Customs are paid in kind by most of the tenants ; and personal Services are likewise exacted. The Salary ofthe Established Schoolmaster is 300 merks, and a School-house, which, with School-fees, and perquisites, make upwards of \u00a320. Sterling per annum. Fuel is abundant in every part of the Parish. There are various roads of communication between the different parts of the Parish, formed by the Sta tute labour: and besides a large and useful Bridge on the river Findhorn, there are a number of smaller ones on the Military road, which were built and are kept in repair at the public expense. In their manners, the Inhabitants are re markably attached to old customs and practices. The language, dress, and most ofthe peculiarities ofthe old Highlanders, continue in this place, with A^ery little alteration. Except the gentry, few of the inhabitants speak English; nor do they discover much inclination to acquire that language. The tartan Plaid and Kilt, and the other parts of dress peculiar to the Highlanders, are still in general use among the Men ; the Women, in like manner, retain the Highland dress of that sex. Their Houses are of the same construction with those of their prede cessors for ages past : and they still place the fire in the middle of the House, rejoicing, as Dr. Johnson observes, \" in the comforts of smoke.\" The ancient Name of the Parish is Star sach-na- Gal, i. e. The Threshold ofthe Gaels, or Highlanders, being the Pass, by which the Highlanders entered into the Low Countrv so narrow between, high mountains, that a few men could defend it against numbers. It was of great consequence to the proprietor iu those times, as he could make inroads into the Low Country, and easily prevent any pursuit beyond that Pass: he could likewise hinder any ofthe neighbouring Clans from passing this place without his consent : and so sensible were they of their de pendence on him, on this account, that they agreed to pay him a certain tax, as often as he gave them permission to take this road with their booty ; which tax is still known by the name of Stuic-chriach, i. e., The Steak or Collop of the Booty,"], [456, "M U C expressive ofthe quality of this plunder, which was cattle. After the district was cleared of wood, and cultivated, it obtained the present name of Moy. It came into the possession of William, the Seventh Laird of Mackintosh, in the year 1336, and was conveyed to him by David Bishop of Moray. The Laird of Mackintosh, who is undoubted Chief of that powerful and respectable Clan, is likewise Captain of Clan Chattan. The Clan Chattan consisted of sixteen tribes, each having their own Chieftain ; but all volun tarily united under the government of one leader, of whom the present Laird of Mackintosh, Sir \u00c6neas Mackintosh, Bart., is the Representative. Tlie Lake of Moy is If mile in length, and f of a mile in breadth; it abounds with char, commonly called red names, and a great variety of trout: in the middle of it, is an Island of about two acres in extent, on which are the remains of a Castle, and other extensive buildings, where the Lairds of Mackin tosh resided in times of trouble * in 1422, it contained a garrison of 400 men. There is also in this Lake an artificial Island, called Ellan-na-glach, i. e. Tlie Stony Island, on which malefactors were usually confined, before the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions. During the season of incubation, cranes and wild ducks frequent this Lake in great numbers. The river Findhorn takes its rise among the hills in this Parish, from a few inconsiderable springs ; the principal one of which issues in a copious stream from a large rock, called The Cloven Stone. Under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, an excel lent road has been made from Inverness, by the Kirk of Daviot, to the Kirk of Moy, a distance of 12 miles : and which supersedes the use of the old Military road, which being constructed without regard to the ruggedness ofthe country, is very ill adapted to the present state of commuuication and traffick among the inhabitants. MOYNESS, v. AULDEARN. MUCHALS, in the Shire of Kincardine ; and in the Parish of Fetteresso. It is 3 m. N. b. E. from Stonehaven. This is a small Fishing Village, on the German Ocean. Great improvements in agriculture have been made here. MUCKAIRN, in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vic arage, now united to the Parish of Ardchattan : The Church is in tolerable repair. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 893, and, in 1S1 1, was 873. It is \\\\ m S. W. from Bunawe. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a310. Sterling. Here is the lofty Mountain of Cruachan Beinn, the perpendi cular height of which is 3390 feet above the level of the sea: its sides are covered"], [457, "M U C with extensive natural woods, which abound with roes and red deer. On the summit of this mountain, is the fatal spring, from whence, according to a tradition ofthe country attributed to Ossian, issued Loch Awe, the beautiful ex panse of water that flows at its base. The sea-pink grows luxuriantly on its top, and sea shells have been found upon the very summit of it. MUCKARSEY, v. FORTEVIOT. MUCKART, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Rectory, belonging to the See of St. Andrew's ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3127..8..7., including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, being the full Teind : the manse is in decent repair: the glebe consists of about 10 acres: Patron, The Crown: The Church is in good condition.

This Parish contains about 4500 acres ; of which, 3000 are arable, and the remainder are hilly, and appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The climate is cold, and rainy, but not unhealthy. The whole ofthe lands are thirled to Muckart Mill, and are liable to pay a heavy multure. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a3100. Scotch, together with about \u00a316. Sterling, being the interest of various mortifications, a school-house, dwelling, and garden. Coals, and lime-stone, are abundant ; but, for some time past, the lime only has been worked, which is in great demand. The Duke of Argyle is Superior. It is watered by the river Dovan, which in its course forms the romantic scenes of The Rumbling Bridge, and The Cauldron Linn. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. This Parish suffered dreadfully in 1645, from The Marquis of Montrose, who, as the enemy and rival ofthe House of Argyle, carried fire and sword through it. MUCK, ISLE, or EILLEAN nan MUCHD, i. e. The Island of Swine, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Small Isles. The Harbour is 6 miles from that of Eigg ; and from whence the Minister performs Divine Service here, once a Month. The Resident Population of this Isle, in 1796, was 193, and, in 1811, was 200. It is about 3 miles in length, and one in breadth : the surface is low, except one hill of inconsiderable height : and the soil is, in general, fertile, and well cultivated. It is very con veniently situate for the fishing grounds. The coast is rocky, and indented with creeks, which afford shelter to small boats, but no safe harbour for vessels : in two of these creeks are small Piers.

This small Island, which is situate in the river Tay, opposite to New burgh, measures 31 acres ; of which, 21 are under cultivation, and produce lux uriant crops, and the remainder is esteemed valuable as a salt marsh for pasture. It is inhabited by one family, who rent it at about \u00a368. Sterling. It is the pro perty of Mr. Hay, of Leys, whose right of fishing in the Tay is rented at about \u00a3200. per annum. MUIR- AVON-SIDE, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. , and a manse : the glebe consists of 4 acres: Patron, The Crown : The Church is old. It is in the Presbytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweed-dale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Linlithgow-Bridge) was 1070, and, in 1811, was 1330. It is 3 m. W. from Linlithgow. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, extending along the Western bank of the river Avon: near the river, the soil is light and gravelly ; the rest is clay, with a mix ture of moss and muir : a considerable part of the Parish is inclosed. On the side ofthe Avon, about half a mile above Linlithgow-Bridge, are the ruins of an old Priory, called Fmianuel, which was founded in 1 156, by Malcolm the Fourth. Near the Church, is an old Castle, called Almond Castle, formerly a seat ofthe Earls of Callander : and as the Barony of Almond has lately been all inclosed, and let out in commodious Farms, and considerable Plantations made on the estate, the beauty and population ofthe place are greatly increased. There are several coal mines, and iron-stone is in great plenty : both of which are worked"], [459, "M U I to a considerable extent.

It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Estates of Wester Gaigie, Muirhouse, Wester Powrie, Wedder burn or Easter Powrie, Ballumbie, West- Hall, and part of Easter Gaigie) was 591, and, in 181 1, was 652. It is 5 m. N. E. from Dundee. This Parish is of small extent, and the greater part of it is good arable land. The air is dry, and very healthy in the Southern district ; but, towards the North, it is more moist, and frequently affected with thick fogs. It abounds with free-stone ; and on the property of Mr. Guthrie, was a valuable marl-pit, which is nearly exhausted, and is now only used upon the land in his own possession. A Turn-pike road passes through the Parish, in a line from Dundee to Brechin : and another Turnpike road, from Broughty Ferry into the inland part of the Country, is chiefly used for a more convenient supply of coals and lime. The estate of Muirhouse is the property of John Guthrie, Esq. , of Guthrie. West-Hall has long been in the possession ofthe truly respectable family of Ogilvy, \u2014 to the worthy descendant of which, William Ogilvy, Esq., the Author feels a peculiar pleasure in re cording his valuable assistance in the progress of this Work.

MULL, ISLE, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Argyle. This Island is about 25 miles in length, and nearly as much in breadth: it is intersected by several arms of the sea, and separated from the district of Lorn by a narrow channel, called The Sound of Mull. The interior parts are mountainous, and covered with heath, but, towards the coast, there are some slips of arable ground, though the extent is trifling when compared with the whole Island. Great num bers of black cattle are annually reared, and exported ; and, indeed, it is chiefly from the sale of these that the farmers make up their rents, which are paid in money. The climate is very moist, the rains being frequent and heavy, and often attended with severe gales of wind from the West : the winters are, how ever, mild, the ground being seldom wholly covered with snow, and the frosts are of short continuance. It abounds with free-stone, lime-stone, and granite ; and some seams of coal have been discovered in different parts. Mull is calcu lated to contain about 425 square miles, and is divided into the three great"], [461, "M U L Parishes of Kill-Ninian and Killmore, Killfinichen and Killviceuen, and Torosay, which also comprehend the adjacent Isles of Gometray,Ulva, Staffa, and I-Colm- Kill. This Island was originally part of the dominions of The Lords of The Isles : but, in after times, became the possession of the ancient and valiant family ofthe Macleans, who still retain half of it; the other moiety being the property of The Duke of Argyle, whose ancestor possessed himself of it in 1674, on account of a debt ; and one of His Grace's Scotch honours is Lord of Mull. There is a stated Ferry from Aros to Morvern, and another from Achnacraig to the Island of Kerrera, and thence to Oban. By a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges by the great landed Proprie tors, on the 24th of February 1808, it appears, \" That the chief obstacle to car rying on any improvement in the extensive and populous Island of Mull, is occasioned by the want of communication by roads from one part of it to another, and to tbe valuable and improveable Islands which lie situate in the vicinity of Mull, such as Tir-Y, Coll, Ulva, Gometray, Staffa, and I-Colm-Kill. With a view to the public advantage, and in order to facilitate the access from the Islands towards the Sea-port Town of Tobermory, and to open a communication from thence through the populous Parishes of Kill-Ninian and Killmore, it is proposed that a line of road should be made from the Town and Harbour of Tobermory, by Ballochroy and Ardow across the country, until such proposed road shall fall into the line of road leading from Tobermory to Achnacraig, near to the Kirk of Salem ; and that the proposed line of road shall have off-set branches, from the most convenient points of communication with the harbour of Croig, being the outlet of Tir-Y ; to the Ferry to The Sound of Ulva; and to Poll-Laich, being the Ferry place to the Island of Coll ; a distance of 31 miles by measurement.\" This line of road is now carrying into effect: \u2014 besides which, it is hoped, that another line of road will ultimately be accomplished, and which had been previ ously surveyed and estimated at the expense of the public ; extending from the Ferry of Achnacraig, by Loch Spelvie, Loch Scredan, and LochBunesson, to the Port of Kintra, opposite the Isle of I-Colm-Kill, a distance of 35J miles.

MUNGO, ST., or CASTLE MILK, in the Shire of Dumfries: formerly a Mensal Church, having been given as such, in the Thirteenth Century, by King Robert Bruce to the Archbishoprick of Glasgow : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 4 chalders ofbear and meal, and \u00a352..10..0. in money: the manse, and offices, are in bad repair: the glebe is upwards of 40 Scotch acres, of the best land in the Parish : Patron, The Crown : The Church, which was built in 1754, seems never to have been properly finished. It is in the Presbytery of Lochmaben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 644, and, in 1811, was 727. It is 4 m. W. b. N. from Eccles- Fechan. This Parish lies in that part ofthe Shire of Dumfries, which was for merly called The Stewartry of Annandale, and contains about 4000 Scotch acres, all inclosed, and well cultivated : the whole Parish is level, except some emi nences of small elevation in the centre, called The Nut-Holm Hills, on which are the vestiges of a Roman, and of several British Camps. It is watered by the Milk, and the Annan, both of which contain salmon; the banks ofthe former river being beautifully clothed with natural wood ; and in many places, the hills are ornamented with flourishing plantations. In some parts of the Lowlands there are lime-stone, and several valuable marl pits. The climate, though sub ject to heavy rains, is nevertheless very healthy. The Church, and Manse, are situate in the very extremity of the Parish, to the South-West, on the bank of the river Annan ; where the lands, which rise by a gradual ascent, to the dis tance of half a mile, in every direction, constitute a most delightful vale : in the centre of this retired spot, wdiere the manse is placed, there are some remains of an ancient Village (built probably by the Friars from Glasgow), and likewise of an extensive garden, with a fish-pond in the middle of it. The greatest part of the Parish is thirled to the Mill of Castle Milk, and pays, of multure, nearly one ninth part ofthe whole ; which is \" a very heavy drawback on the improvement ofthe country.\" Game is abundant. Fuel is expensive. The great turnpike road, from Carlisle to Glasgow, runs through the East end ofthe Parish, by the bridge over the river Milk : but another bridge is wanted over the river Annan, by which an advantageous communication might easily be opened with the Solway Firth. Castle Milk, now the property and residence of Robertson Lidder dale, Esq., is situate on a beautiful sloping hill, in the centre of a fine Valley,"], [463, "MUR which is watered by the Milk : it was formerly a seat of the ancient Lords of Annandale, and came from the Bruces to the Stewarts by Walter, High Steward of Scotland, who married the daughter of King Robert Bruce ; and so descended to Robert, High Steward of Scotland, their son, the first of the Stewarts who came to the Crown, in 1371 : it afterwards belonged to the Maxwells, and the Douglases. It was besieged by The Duke of Somerset, Protector in the Minority of Edward the Sixth : it again suffered all the miseries of war under Oliver Cromwell; and though his entrenchments (still dis tinctly visible) had greatly the command of the place, it nevertheless held out for a considerable time. The Castle was demolished in the year 1707, and con verted into a dwelling-house, which has since been much improved : and it is now one ofthe most delightful and romantic situations that can well be conceived. Sir John Stewart, Bart., of Castle Milk, near Glasgow, takes his designation from this place. The Proprietor ofthe estate of Castle Milk, which extends to about one-third of the Parish, is now carrying on considerable improvements with great vigour. St. Mungo or Kentigern, from whom the Parish takes its name, was a celebrated British Saint : And, according to Mr. Chalmers, \" in the Bishoprick of Glasgow, according to the custom of St. Mungo, the widow of a tenant, on the Bishop's Rental, was entitled, while she remained single, to hold her husband's lands, for life : This Custom was sustained by the Court of Ses sion, as late as 1633.\" \u2014 MUNLOCHY, in the Shire of Ross ; and in the Parish of Knockbain.

It is a considerable Sea-Port Town, situate at the mouth ofthe river Esk, and is said to derive its name from an extensive -Muscle bank, which lies in the Firth of Forth below the Town, and was probably the cause of its early population. Musselburgh is a Very ancient Burgh of Regality, and was once called Musselburgh- Shire : the Mill, to which this Regality was astricted and thirled, is called The Shire-Mill, and the wood along the banks ofthe river, of which little now remains, is called Shire-icood; and Sher iff- Hall, at the extremity of the Regality, has acquired its name in the same manner. Before the Reformation, it was an Ecclesiastical Burgh belonging, among other possessions, to the Abbacy of Dunfermlin : It was disjoined by King James the Sixth from that Abbacy, who gave the super iority of it to his Chancellor, Lord Thirlestane, the worthy progenitor of the Earls of Lauderdale. And when the whole Abbacy was given to Queen Anne of Denmark, she re-claimed the Regality of Musselburgh, as comprehended under the gift : but the Proprietor contended, that it had ab ante been gifted to him, which defence was sustained. Certain parts, however, of this Regality and Parish have been disjoined, and added to the Parishes of Cranston, Newton, and Dalkeith. Much of this vast estate, notwithstanding the profusion of the cele brated Duke of Lauderdale, and the dangers of forfeiture, descended to Earl John, who died in 1710 : and from him, in 1709, Anne Duchess of Buccleugh and Monmouth, purchased what remained of that great property. It is now holden by The Duke of Buccleugh, as Lord Superior of the Regality ; and pays annually to that Nobleman, certain sums as quit-rent and feu-duty. The Territories of the Burgh stretch along the sea-coast, the whole extent of the Parish, and are about two measured miles and a half in length, and from one-half to one-fourth of a mile in breadth ; comprehending in the Division of Mussel burgh, the Town of Musselburgh, West Pans, and Newbiggin, \u2014 and in the"], [465, "M U S Division of Fisher-Row, the Suburb of Fisher-Row, Market-Gate, Bridge-End, Timber-Bush, Spring-Garden, Brunstane-Mill, and Magdalen-Pans. At the East end of Musselburgh, was the celebrated Chapel of Our Lady of Loretto, with the Hermits Cell adjoining : during the ravages of The Earl of Hertford, in May 1544, he destroyed this famous Chapel, with a part ofthe Town : it was soon repaired : but, it was finally abolished, at the Reformation ; and, in 1590, the materials ofthe Chapel which had once so many votaries, were converted to the building of the Tolbooth, of Musselburgh: This is said to have been the first Religious House in Scotland, whose ruins were applied to an unhallowed use, for which the good people of Musselburgh are said to have been annually excommunicated until very lately, at Rome. The site of this Chapel, and Her- mitage, is now comprised within the garden ofthe Gentleman who possesses the Villa, called Loretto. - Within these forty years, there was a middle row of houses Eastward from the Tolbooth, one of which had been a Chapel, called Chapel Gavel. There were various other old Chapeb in different situations ; one was in a garden in the West end of Market-Gate, and one in New Hailes grounds, called Magdalen Chapel, near to Magdalen Bridge, of which. there are now no remains ; besides an Alms-house in Market-Gate, which is now a Dwelling-House. It is reported, that it received its first Charter about the year 1340, from The Earl of Marr, for their attention to the great Randolph Earl of Murray, who died of the stone in this Town, in the month of July 1332 : and Sir John Sinclair, with a due regard to antiquity, has preserved the ground plan and elevation ofthe house of this eminent man, which is still pointed out to strangers,. But the most ancient Charter of this Burgh now extant, is dated the llth of December 1562, and is granted by Robert, Commtndator of Dun- fermlin, with consent ofthe whole Members ofthe Convent : it narrates, \" That the Title-deeds belonging to the Burgh were burnt by their enemies the English, after the fatal battle of Pinkie ; therefore, they, of new, grant, dispone, and confirm to the present Baillies, Community, and Inhabitants of Musselburgh, and to their Successors .\" This Charter is confirmed by many subsequent Char- ters, and Acts of Parliament ; particularly by a Charter from The Duke of Lauderdale, in 1670, in which all their ancient Rights and Privileges are nar rated and confirmed. In 1632, it was erected into a Royal Burgh, by a Charter under the Great Seal ; but the Magistrates of Edinburgh obtained a decreet of reduction of that Charter before the Privy Council, on the 30th of November of the same year, in consequence of a compromise with the Magistrates of VOL. ik 3 M"], [466, "M U T Musselburgh. It is governed by a Town-Council of 18 members, 10 of whom are elected from Musselburgh, and 8 from Fisher-Row ; the whole Regality in this Division being considered as Fisher-Row, except what is within the ancient Ports of Musselburgh : out of these, two Baillies and a Treasurer are annually elected, but may not be re-elected more than two years without intermission ; two Counsellors go off annually by a vote ofthe Council, and two are chosen in their room by the same body. There are also seven incorporated Trades. The annual Revenue arising from Shores-dues, Feu-duties, Mill-rents, &c, amounts to upwards of \u00a31500. The Magistrates are empowered to hold a Court of Record, to issue Precepts both on their decrees and registrations, and to grant infestments ; and, upon the whole, it possesses all the Privileges ofa Royal Burgh, except those of voting for the election ofa Member of Parliament, and of sending a Delegate to the Convention of Burghs. Great quantities of Salt are annually made here. This Port is subordinate to the Custom-House at Preston Pans. Between the Sea and the Town, lie the extensive downs, called Mus selburyh Links, excellently adapted for the healthful exercise of the Golf. The manly exercise of Archery is also practised here, where an ancient silver Arrow is preserved, which is shot for annually by the Royal Company of Archers. There is now, and has long been, a flourishing Grammar School in this Town, under the Patronage ofthe Magistrates, the Town-Council, and the Minister: the Salary is \u00a328. per annum, with a good house, and garden. There are also three Boarding Schools for Young Ladies, which have met with great encou ragement. On the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, in 1747, The Duke of Buccleugh claimed for this Regality, \u00a33000. Musselburgh gives the title of Baron to The Earl of Lauderdale.

Sterling: the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of 8 acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church is very ancient. It is in the Presbytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2880, and, in 1811, was 3090. It is 4 m. S. from Crieff. The Fairs are holden on the 19th of January, 6th of May, 5th of August, and 31st of October. It is situate on the great Military road, from Stirling to Inverness. This Parish is from 8 to 10 miles in length, and from 6 to 9 miles in breadth, being situate on the Borders ofthe Highlands. The surface is hilly : but on the haughs ofthe Earn and the Allan, there is a considerable extent of arable land, of alight loam, and exceedingly fertile : the higher grounds"], [467, "M Y R are barren, and wet ; and, in the South-West district, there are many thousand acres, completely covered with heath, or deep moss. Several extensive plan tations have lately been made here. The climate is damp, and cold, but toler ably healthy. Game, of all kinds, are abundant. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites : besides which, The Society for propagating Christian Knowlege have established a School here, with a Salary of \u00a312. : And, at The Chapel of Ease, lately, built on the South side of the Parish, there is another School, the master of which is Precentor of the Chapel, and has a small salary, but chiefly depends upon the profits of his School. At Strageath, on the banks ofthe Earn, are the vestiges ofa small Ro man Station, which is supposed to have been the ad Hiernam, of Richard of Cirencester : But, at Ardoch, is the famous one, the area of which is an oblong of 140 yards, by 125 : this is supposed to be the most complete o\u00a3any in Great Britain, and, with a taste and zeal which do honour to the present worthy Proprietor, Sir William Stirling, Bart., whose valuable and hospitable Man sion is adjacent, it has been inclosed with a high stone wall, to preserve it from future demolition : from the ramparts of this important fortress may be seen the plain of Sheriff-Muir, where the ill-disputed battle of Dunblane was fought, in 1715 : The Earl ofMARR having laid the Evening before at Ardoch. By a cruel command of The Pretender, the Village of Muthil, with several others, were burned in the month of January 1716. Upon a rock, about a mile to the West ward ofthe Military road, is Drummond Castle, the ancient Seat ofthe Illustri ous Family of Perth, who are Proprietors of more than two-thirds ofthe Parish : it is delightfully situate at the head of the vale of Strathearn, and attracts the notice and admiration of every stranger, for the beautiful and unbounded pros pect which it commands.

JNaIRN, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Nairn: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of victual, \u00a327. in money, and \u00a35. for Communion elements: Patron, James Brodie, Esq., of Brodie : The Church, Manse, and Offices, are in toler- able condition. This was originally a Mensal Church, attached to the Deanry of Auldearn. It is in the Presbytery of Nairn, and Synod of Moray. The Resi- dent Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2215, and, in 1811, was 2504. It is 167 m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the 18th of February, first Tuesday in March, first Tuesday, O. S. , in June, the last Wednes- day in August, the 20th of September, or Friday after, and that day fortnight, and the 3d Tuesday in December. It is a neat Town, situate at the confluence ofthe river Nairn with the Firth of Moray, and has a small and convenient Harbour which might be much improved. At what period it was erected into a Royal Burgh, is uncertain ; the oldest Charter extant is one from James the Sixth, dated in 1589, being the renewal of one granted by King Alexander, probably the first of that name who swayed the Scottish sceptre. In 1661, this Charter was con- firmed by one from Charles the Second, by which the government ofthe Town is vested in a Provost, three Baillies, a Dean of Guild, and Treasurer, with eleven Counsellors, nine of whom make a Quorum. The Three Baillies, the Dean of Guild, and Treasurer, in consequence ofa late decision ofthe House of Peers, must be resident. The whole of the Trades make but one Corporation. Nairn, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Inverness, Forres, and Fort- rose, send one Member to Parliament. Its immunities and possessions were formerly very great, but, through lapse of time, they have been much diminished, though they are still considerable, and are increasing. The Town appears to have undergone many changes : it w-as originally situate half a mile at least from the place where it now stands, and was defended by a Castle, the ruins of which are so covered by the sea, that the foundations of it are only visible at Spring tides. It is a General Post-Office Town ; and the Seat of a Presbytery. This Parish is 8 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth. Along the coast, the soil is"], [469, "N A I sandy ; by the side of the river Nairn, it is clay ; and, in the Southern district, it is a rich heavy mould. On the North side of the river, the ground is level : but, on the South, it rises with a gradual ascent, terminating at one corner of the Parish, in The Hill of Urchany, which is elevated about 500 feet above the level of the sea. Few customs or carriages are exacted by the Proprietors. The Grammar School is, and has been in a very flourishing condition for many years past, the present Master, who is extremely attentive and assiduous, has been re markably successful ; and many gentlemen who now make a conspicuous figure in the World, are indebted to him for the excellence of their education. The Salmon fishery on the water of Nairn, is the property of The Earl of Seafield, and of Mr. Davidson, of Cantray ; who have also a Stell fishery at the mouth of the river; these fishings are let to two Tacksmen, who drag the river, and the stell fishings, alternately. James Brodie, Esq., of Brodie, has also a Stell fish ing on the East side ofthe entrance ofthe river. There are several fishing Boats in the Town, and in the Country part ofthe Parish. The great military Road, leading from Forres to Fort George, is in very good repair: and the Highland Road, from Nairn to the Bridge of Dulsie, is now put into good condition : Sta tute labour is not commuted. The only Bridge in the Parish deserving of notice, is that of Nairn : it was built in 1631 or 1632, and, in the year 1782, nearly one half of it was carrried away by a flood ; in that situation it now continues ; and were it not to the attention of the Magistrates and Council, who have made a temporary repair with limber, on many occasions, the river would be impassable. On the North side ofthe hill of Geddes are the vestiges of an old Castle, called Finlay's Castle, which appears to have been a strong edifice. And, on the East side of the same hill, are the remains of Rait Castle, which is said to have been the residence ofa branch ofthe powerful Family of Cumyn. At Easter Geddes, are the foundations of a Chapel, Avhich was dedicated to Tlie Virgin Mary, and which was endowed with \u00a35. Scotch, together with a small croft, as a glebe, and the site ofthe manse. The Thanes of Calder were, for a long series of years, Hereditary Constables, and Sheriffs of this County; and the site ofthe Consta bulary is still visible in the Town of Nairn. The climate is remarkably salu brious. All the necessaries of life are abundant, and are sold at a moderate price ; and it is well calculated for sea-bathing. It formerly gave the title of Baron to the Family of Nairn, attainted for their concern in the Rebellion of 1715. Several Roman coins have been discovered here. See, Inverness. NAIRN, SHIRE. This Shire stretches from the coast of the Moray Firth,"], [470, "N E I in a Southern direction to Lochindorb, about 20 miles, where it terminates nearly in a point between the Shires of Elgin and Inverness : Its breadth along the shore is 12 miles: its sides extend to 22 miles about the middle, from whence they begin to approximate each other. Exclusive ofthe hilly part ofthe district, it may be described as a narrow border of level ground along the shore, from one to nearly six miles in breadth, which is abundantly fertile, and well culti vated. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 8257, and, in 1811, was 8251. It was formerly a part of the Shire of Moray. NANTHORN, v. EDENHAM. NAVAR, in the Shire of Forfar : an ancient Parish, united to the Parish of Lethnot about the year 1723. It is bounded on the South and South-West by the Western ridge of Caterthun, which divides it from Menmuir ; on the West it is separated from the Glens of Fern, Tannadice, Cortachy and Clova, by a great extent ofthe Grampian Mountains ; and towards the North, others of these Mountains divide it from the Parish of Loch Lee. The only remarkable object in this Parish, is the lofty rock, which is distinguished by the name of Corny Birn. On the towering summit of this immense mass the Eagles nestle in secu rity : it is insulated by the two small rivulets Coskantry and Duskantry, both of which abound with trout of a most delicious kind : a little to the Eastward of this Rock, where these two rivulets unite, the Wester water begins.

Sterling: the manse was built in 1766: the glebe is not legal as to the arable land, and has no pasture, and it has this farther disadvantage, that there are four feus upon it: Patron, Archibald Speirs, Esq., of Elder slie : The Church was built in 1762, and is a neat, commodious edifice. It is in the Presbytery of Paisley, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Par ish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Barr-Head, Neilston, and Uplaw-Moor) was 3796, and, in 1811, was 4949. It is 54 m. W. S. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The cotton manufacture is carried on here to a great extent. This Parish contains about 13,570 Scotch acres. The surface is tolerably level, but divided into two districts by a range of hills, called"], [471, "N E I Loch Libo Side, and Faraneze, which extends through the whole length of it : the lower grounds are fertile, but the sides ofthe hills are barren, and are now covered with extensive Plantations. Coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, are abundant. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites, and an excellent dwelling, and garden. Here are several Gentlemens' Seats ; the principal of which are, Ralston, the residence of Gavin Ralston, Esq., \u2014 Faraneze, of A. Graham, Esq., \u2014 and Loch Libo Side, the property of Robert Fulton, Esq., of Heart field. Neilston was an ancient possession of the Crocs, of that Ilk, a potent family of great Antiquity in this Shire ; but, in the reign of Malcolm the Second, this district, together with the lands of Crocston and Darnly, were conveyed by the marriage of the heiress, daughter of Robert de Croc, to a younger brother of the Illustrious family of Stewart, of whom were descended the Stewarts, promiscuously designed of Crocston and Darnly, afterwards Earls and Dukes of Lennox. The Castle of Crocston, which is delightfully situate upon the summit of a little hill, appears from the fragments to have been of great magnificence, when in its full glory. To this place Henry Darnly retired with his enamoured Queen, Crocston being then, as Clifden in the time of Villiers, \" The Seat of wantonness and love.\" Here fame says, Mary first resigned herself to the arms of her beloved, beneath a great Yew tree, still existing ; \u2014 \" but no loves,\" says Mr. Pennant, \" would \" smile on joys commenced beneath the shade of this Funereal tree ; the hour \" was unpropitious, \u2014 \" Ille dies primus Lethi, primusque malorum, causa suit. \" It was even said, that Mary, unconscious of events, struck a Coin on the occa \" sion, with the figure of the fatal tree, honoured with a crown, and distinguished \" by the Motto, Dat gloria vires. But I have opportunity of contradicting this \" opinion, from an examination of the coins themselves, whose dates are 1565, \" 1566, and 1567. The tree is evidently a Palm, circumscribed, ExurgatDeus, \" dissipentur inimici ejus. Pendent from the boughs, is the Motto above cited, \" which is part ofthe following lines taken from Propertius, alluding to a snail te climbing up the body of the tree, \u2014 a modest comparison ofthe honours that \" Henry Darnly received by the Union with his Royal spouse: \" Magnum iter ascendo, sed dat mihi gloria vires, \" Non juvat ex facili, lata corona jugo.\""], [472, "N E S NENTHORN, anciently NAYTHANS-THIRN, in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Rectory, with the Chapel of Little Newton annexed : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3600.

This Parish contains about 1900 acres. The surface is in general level, with a moderate descent to the South; and the soil is remarkably good, except towards the North, where it is poor muir ground, on a cold tilly bottom. The air is pure, and healthy. There is plenty of whin and freestone, fit for building ; and clay, and shell marl, are found in considerable quantities. Coals are the common fuel, which are brought from the County of Northumberland, and from Lothian. On the banks of the Eden, are two re markable rocks, commonly called The Meikle and Little Thairn, and from whence tlie Name of the District is thought to be derived. The Parish of Nenthorn appears to have been established, during the Thirteenth Century; and, was formed ofthe ancient manors of Nay thans-Thirn, and Little Newton, which are joined together by a narrow isthmus, that is intersected by the Eden. In the Twelfth Century, both those Manors belonged to the opulent and liberal family ofthe Morvilles, Hereditary Constables of Scotland ; but they afterwards de scended to the Lords of Galloway, a more powerful family. Both Nay thans-Thirn and Little Newton were then considered as Chapels, subordinate to the mother Church of Edenham, and belonged to the Monks of Coldingham : but, before the year 1316, Naythans-Thirn was made a Parochial Church, while that of Little Newton continued only a Chapel ; and so they remained, until the Reformation. Here is a Lake, called Lurgie Loch. NESTING, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Rectory and Vicarage, with the Parishes of Lunasting, and Whalsay, and the detached Islands of The Skerries, annexed : the Stipend of this Minis try is at present (1811) one ofthe highest in the Shetland Isles, and is upwards of \u00a3107.

NEVAY, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Rectory, now united to the Parish of Essie : The Church, which is now in ruins, would seem to have been used anciently as a place of security, in turbulent times ; as it is built upon a tumulus, in the middle of a large morass, which must have been difficult of ac- cess ; and, within the recollection of persons now living, the morass has been drained, and the moss appropriated to fuel, to the depth of 15 feet : a consider- able part ofthe land is now under cultivation : About twenty years ago, Divine Service was performed in the Churches of Essie, and Nevay, alternately. The greatest part of this Parish is in a high state of cultivation ; and The Honour* able James Stewart Wortley Mackenzie, to whom it belongs, has, within these few years, very much ornamented the district, by building a number of ex- cellent and useful Farm-steads, for his thriving tenantry. It is enriched by Quarries of capital free-stone ; and one, ofa superior colour and quality, which is used for pavements. In digging for the foundation of a house, a stone coffin was found, containing bones of very large dimensions ; but the masons had broken the stones, and destroyed the contents, before they revealed the discovery.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 832, and, in 1811, was 1045. It is 7| m. S. b. W. from Dumfries. This Parish con tains about 7810 Scotch acres, stretching along the Western side of the river Nilh. Towards the South, it is level, and is regularly inclosed and highly cul tivated : but, in the Western extremity, it is hilly, and interspersed with mosses, and extensive muirs. The climate, though subject to frequent storms of wind, and heavy falls of rain, is nevertheless remarkably healthy ; insomuch, that invalids particularly resort hither in the summer months for the benefit of the pure air, goat's whey, and sea-bathing. Vessels of 60 or 70 tons burden come up a Burn in the Parish, called New Abbey Pow, importing lime and shells for manure, and some coals ; and exporting oats, oat-meal, barley, potatoes, and charcoal for England and Grenock. Loch Kindar is about a mile and a quarter long, and three quarters ofa mile broad, and abounds with fine trout : Lochend, and Craigend Lakes are each about three quarters ofa mile long, and half a mile broad, and abound with pike. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees and perquisites, and a comfortable dwelling-house : besides which, there are two other Schools with trifling Salaries, one at each extremity ofthe Parish. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. The impolitic system of multures is still continued, most of the lands paying one-thirteenth of all the corn they grind, to the proprietor ofthe mill, besides the miller's dues ; and they also pay one-seventeenth of all grain sold. Here was a famous Cistertian Abbey, founded and richly endowed in the beginning of the Thirteenth Century by Dervorgilla, daughter of Alan, Lord of Galloway, wife to John Baliol, Lord of Castle Barnard, and mother of John Baliol, King of Scotland, who died in 1269, and was here interred. Andrew Winton, Prior of Loch Leven, informs us, that, after his death, the Lady Dervorgilla caused his Heart to be taken out and embalmed ; and putting it into an ivory box, bound with silver and ena melled, closed it solemnly in the walls of the Church, near to the High Altar ; from which circumstance it was styled, Hie Abbey of Street Heart, though it was afterwards more generally called New Abbey. It is situate in the middle of a"], [475, "NEW level field of about 20 acres, called The Precinct, which is surrounded by a high wall : and is a lofty and beautiful building, of the light Gothick style of archi tecture. Aster the Reformation, it was in the hands of the Crown, from 1587, when the Annexation Act passed, to the year 1624, when it was granted to Sir Robert Spottiswood, of that Ilk, designed Lord New Abbey ; in whose time the yearly value ofthe Barony was \u00a3212..10..10|.

But it was afterwards burdened by Queen Anne, with a mortification in favour of the Second Minister of Dumfries, which is paid out ofthe lands of Drum, in this Parish ; and which, with several decreets of locality, amount to \u00a3141..4..8|. It now belongs to Mr. Copeland, by purchase. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. Near New Abbey are the remains of an ancient Tower, called The Abbots Tower, which was the residence of the Abbots of Siceet Heart, when they chose to retire for a short time from the cares of their Office. It commands an extensive prospect, and, when in repair, must have been a more healthy habitation than The Abbey, which lies low. It is now the property of Mrs. Maxwell, of Kirk-Connel. Mr. Grose has also preserved a view of this Tower. NEWARK, v. ANDREW'S, ST. NEWARK, v. MONANCE, ST. NEWARK, v. NEW PORT-GLASGOW. NEWARK, CASTLE, v. SELKIRK.

This Village has been possessed by portioners, who hold of The Marquis of Lothian, since the year 1611. The sole property of it, however, falls to His Lordship at Martinmas 1815, according to the decision of Lord Justice Clerk, to whom it was referred by both parties. NEWBOTTLE, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Vicarage, and now comprehending the ancient Parish of Maisterton ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 8 bolls of wheat, 24 bolls of barley, 24 bolls of oats, and \u00a360. in money ; together with a glebe, which lies at some distance from the Manse, containing 6 acres of good land: Patron, The Marquis of Lothian: The Church, which was built, in 1727, is a neat and commodious Edifice. It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Abbey was founded by David the First, in 1140, for Monks of the Cistertian Order : After the 3N2"], [476, "NEW Reformation, the small Parish of Maisterton was united to the Abbey Parish, in the Western part of which it is situate ; and The Abbey Church now became the Parish Church. The Patronage of the United Church, the Manor of Newbottle, the Lands of Maisterton , and other property, were possessed by Mark Ker, the last Commendator of The Abbey, who died, in 1584 : His son, Mark, obtained from James the Sixth, the whole estates ofthe Monks of Newbottle to be erected into a Barony, in 1587 ; a Lordship, in 1591 ; and an Earldom, in 1606; he died in 1609 : and His descendant, The Marquis of Lothian, now enjoys these exten sive possessions. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1328, and, in 1811, was 1651. It is -j m. S. from Dalkeith. This Parish is about four miles in length, and of the same extent in breadth. The greater part lies in a beautiful and romantic Vale, through which the river South Esk flowis, hav ing a rich and fertile soil, in some places upwards of four feet deep : from the low grounds the surface rises in a gradual manner for the course of two miles to a ridge, the highest point of which is elevated 680 feet above the level ofthe sea, and upon which are distinct vestiges ofa Roman camp, containing nearly three acres of ground : the soil in this upper district is fully as barren as the valley is fer tile, being marshy and muiry,upon acold till. Coals, and Lime-stone, abound here. The School was removed, many years ago, from this Village to Fuffel; which, though nearer to the centre ofthe Parish, is found inconvenient, on account of its remoteness from the most populous and frequented quarters : the Salary, toge ther with School -fees, and emoluments, amount to upwards of \u00a322. per annum.

It is 5 ra. S. E. from Ellon. This is a small village, plea santly situate on the Northern bank of the river Ythan, at its confluence with the German Ocean. The Ythan, which is much frequented, is navigable for vessels of from 100 to 150 tons burden about a mile from its entrance, but smaller ves sels can proceed about three miles further. Although it has no harbour, (but which, it 3s supposed, might be made at a moderate expense,) the exportation of grain and meal from hence is nevertheless considerable ; and great quantities of lime, coals, and wood, are annually imported. Near this, are the ruins ofa small Hospital, called The Red Chapel of Buchan, which was founded in the reign of Alexander the Third, by Alexander Earl of Buchan, Justice-General of Scotland.

The Town of Newburgh was, at an early period, erected into a Burgh of Regality, under the Abbot of Lindores: and, in 1631, after that Abbacy was erected into a Temporal Lordship, Charles the First granted a Charter to the Town, erecting it into a Royal Borough, with many immunities and privileges, which it still enjoys, except that of sending a Member to Parliament, and a dele gate to the Convention of Royal Boroughs. It is governed by a Baillie, and has a weekly Court of Record. The Revenue ofthe Burgh is inconsiderable. It is situate on the South bank of the Tay, most of the houses being lately rebuilt, and the streets well paved. The principal manufacture is that of linen. A General Post-Office is established here. The Harbour is spacious, and a number of ships belong to the place; the Tay being navigable for ves sels of 500 tons, as far as the Town.

The Parish of Newburgh is small, and its figure is very irregular ; one part of it being detached from the other, by the intervention of a part of the Parish of Abdie. The soil on the lower grounds is a rich clay ; but, on the hills, it is light and gravelly, and in some places mossy, on a till bottom. Here are two ancient Crosses, called The Cross of Macduff, and The Cross of Mugdrum ; both of which have been covered with Hieroglyphics, now defaced. At the North-East extremity of the Parish, on a gentle eminence, near the river Tay, are the ruins of the ancient Abbey of Lindores ; which was founded by David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother to William the First, on his return from The Holy Land, about the year 1178, for Tyronensian Monks, who were brought from the Abbey of Kelso. On the 25th of December 1600, it was erected into a Temporal Lordship by James the Sixth, in favour of Patrick Leslie, son of Andrew Earl of Rothes, which title is now dormant. In the 13th vol. of Arch\u00e6ologia, p. 196, is an explanation, and engraving ofthe Seal of this Abbey. About the year 1741, the Abbey, with a small part of the Abbey lands, which, till that time, had been retained by the family at Lindores, passed into the hands of the son ofa former Minister of Newburgh ; and, by a subse quent sale, are now in the possession of the Hays, of Mugdrum. \u2014 Mugdrum House, their residence, is a stately modern building, finely situate near the South bank of the Tay, at the East end of the Town.

This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The surface is diver sified with hill, and dale ; the eminences being mostly green, without heath. The arable land, which comprehends about 1300 Scotch acres, is chiefly a clayey loam, upon a close impervious tilly bottom. Trees thrive well in every part of the Parish ; the greater part whereof is inclosed by hedge-rows and fences, and sheltered by plantations. It is watered by the river Lyne, and a small tributary stream, called the Terth, which unite near the Church. The principal Mansions are The Wheam, a Seat of the late Lord Chief Baron Mont gomery : \u2014 La Mancha, the property of The Honourable Captain Cochrane: \u2014 and Magbie-Hill, the seat of Mr. Montgomery. There is also an old Building, called Drochil Castle, situate at the confluence of the Terth and Lyne, which was begun by Morton, Regent of Scotland ; but who was beheaded be fore it was finished. Here is plenty of excellent free-stone, and several rich beds of marl : there is likewise great abundance of a species of till, which contains allum. In the lands of La Mancha, are ten veins of iron ore, one of which affords a considerable quantity of native loadstone : all these veins are on the side of a hill of easy access, and are worked without pits. A manufactory for converting ochre into paint, has been established by The Honourable Captain Cochrane, which is now carried on with great success. Coal, and Lime-stone, abound in almost every estate in the Parish. Near La Mancha, is a Chalybeate spring. The Roads in Newlands are under the same Act as in Linton, and Statute labour is commuted at the same rates. In some parts of this Parish the lands are thirled to the extent of the sixteenth of all the Oats raised ; horse corn, and the seed sown on the farm, only excepted.

The great Road, from Dumfries to Port Patrick, passes through it; and it is also a convenient Stage between the Ferry-Town of Cree, and Glen Luce. This Village owed its origin to a younger branch ofthe Stewarts, Earls of Galloway, who possessed the estate of Castle Stewart, and first erected a few houses upon it, to which he gave the name of Newton Stewart.

Near these ruins, were until lately some vestiges of a more ancient Castle, called The Castle of Balcraig. At Auchtertyre, about a quarter ofa mile from the village, are the traces, very distinct, of the Camp, where Montrose's army is said to have taken their station for some nights, while The Marquis himself lodged at a neighbouring Castle, after burning the house of Newton of Blairgowrie, then the property of the father of the late Pro vost Drummond of Edinburgh : About a quarter of a mile South from this Station, were discovered one of those places called Pictish Houses ; it was of very large dimensions, being curiously and commodiously constructed, and capable of containing a very considerable quantity of stores : and was probably used as a safe deposit in times of war.

A spirit of industry and improvement prevails among all ranks of persons here : and mul tures, and embarrassing services, are totally abolished. This Parish compre hends Altens, Balnagask, North and South Kirkhill, North and South Loirstown, Middletown, Tulloes, and Reserved Lands in the Town of Aberdeen. NIGG, in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Mensal Church, belonging to the Bishoprick of Ross ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 10 chalders of barley, with the Vicarage teinds, a good manse, and offices, and a glebe of rather more than 4 acres of excellent land'. Patron, The Crown : The Church was built in 1727, and is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Tain, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1443, and, in 1811, was 1349. It is 3 m. N. from Cromartv. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and, in some places, between 2 and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern entrance ofthe Firth of Cromarty: over which there is a Ferry to that Town. The Hill of Nigg , which over-hangs the Moray Firth, is bold and rocky ; and, during the season of incubation, is frequented by prodigious numbers of birds : a considerable part of it is now covered with thriving plantations. The soil is light and sandy ; and the seasons are early. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites : And the Society for propagating Chris tian Knowledge have lately established a School-Mistress here. Near Shand wicke House, the property of Mr. Cockburn Ross, is a large Obelisk, with hieroglyphic figures upon it ; which, according to tradition, commemorates a dreadful shipwreck ofthe Danes upon the coast, and in which three sons ofthe King of Denmark perished, and were buried there. In the Church-yard, is"], [489, "N IN another Obelisk, which is also said to have been erected by the Danes; but, in 1725, it was thrown down by a remarkable storm of wind. At the Point of Nigg, are the remains ofa Fort, called Dunskeath, which, according to Lord Hailes, was built in 1 179, by William the Lion, King of Scotland : and, the Farm ad joining to it, is still called Castle Craig. On the Farm of Ankerville, more than a mile from the sea, and nearly 200 feet above its level, is a stratum of oyster shells of considerable extent, and above 6 inches in depth : they lie about three feet below the surface, and underneath them is a stratum of fine sand, like that on the sea-shore. The multures are exorbitant. Fuel is scarce. The roads are bad. NINE STONE RIDGE, v. CASTLE-TOWN. NINEWARE, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Dunbar. This is a beautiful Seat of Mr. Hamilton, of Bangour. It is 3 m. W. S. W. from Dunbar. NINE-WELLS, v. CHIRNSIDE.

It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Bannock- Burn, Charters-Hall, Clayhills, Mill-Town, Newhouse, Newmarket, Polmaise, and Powmill) was 6849, and, in 1811, was 7636. It is If m. S. from Stirling. This Parish, at a medium, is about 10 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth ; but, in one direction, the extremities are 15 or 16 miles asunder : it is divided into the carse, dry-field, and muir lands ; and the greater part of the arable ground is inclosed, and well cultivated. It is thought, that the Royal Forest of Dundaff must have covered the high lands, as they are still called by the name of Tlie Lands of Dundaff . At the Torr-Wood the Roman Causeway enters 3P2"], [490, "N I S this Parish, and passes through it in a North-West direction. Near the source of the Carron are some ruins, which are generally supposed to be the remains of a Castle, once the residence of Sir John Graham, who fell in the battle of Fal kirk, bravely defending the liberty of his country against the ambition of Edward the First. All the Roads, and Bridges, are in excellent repair. Gillies Hill is situate in the rauirlands, where the names both of Gillies, and Morison, still occur ; aud, as it is certain, that the fair Lady, mother of Gil Morrice, \" lived on the Carron side,\" it is thought, that this Parish was the scene of the Tragi cal Song, known by the name of Gil Morrice, or Child Maurice which is pro bably the original title. This little pathetic tale, according to Mr. Ritson, is said to have suggested the plot ofthe tragedy of Douglas : and Dr. Percy was assured, that the Ballad is still current in many parts of Scotland, where the Hero is universally known by the name of Child Maurice, pronounced by the common people, Cheeld. Here are four Tanneries. There are three Coal works, which supply the adjacent country to a very considerable extent. The Parish abounds with lime-stone, ofa remarkably good quality. The Salary ofthe Gram mar School is 300 merks, besides perquisites amounting lo about \u00a320. more, aud also an excellent dwelling-house, school-house, garden, and the ordinary school-fees. Beaton's Mill, the house where James the Third was put to death, is still standing, and may be ranked amongst the numerous monuments of that ambition, which often endangered, and, in the end, ruined the Royal Family of Stuart. The late Robert Henry, D. D., one of the Ministers of The Old Church in Edinburgh, and Author of \"A History of Britain, on a new Plan,\" was a Native of this Parish : this laborious work has merited the public appro bation by the large editions which have been printed in a Quarto and Octavo form : in his private character Dr. Henry was an amiable man, fond of society; and in his clerical conduct, he was exemplary and devout : he died in Edinburgh, in the month of November 1790. There are many elegant Residences, particu larly Sauchie, the Seat of The Honourable Major Hamilton; \u2014 and Touch- Adam, the seat of William Murray, Esq. NINI AN'S, ST. , ISLE, one of the Shetland Isles ; and constituting part of the Parish of Dunross-Ness. Between this Isle and the Mainland, is safe anchor age for small Vessels.

NISBET, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh : The Church"], [491, "NOR was demolished many years ago, but its Cemetery is still used by the old Fami lies. It is one ofthe Parishes, now included in the Union of Crailing. Nisbet is famous, by tradition, for being a strong-hold of some ofthe ancient marauders of the Border. By the forfeiture of William Soules in the reign of Robert the First, the Barony of Nisbet became the property of Walter, the Steward of Scotland : and, in 1371, the Baronies of Nisbet, and Ednam, were granted by Robert the Second to Sir Robert Erskine, and Christian de Keth, his spouse. There are the ruins of two strong Towers at the Village of Nether Nisbel, where stones of excellent workmanship are occasionally dug up. This Parish also deserves to be mentioned, ou account of its antiquity, and the singularity of its tenure ; \u2014 that the Proprietor of the Barony of Crailing is bound to furnish a Guard of his own Vassals, for the Circuit Court of Justiciary, when it meets at Jedburgh : On this account, there is annexed to that Barony, the property of some acres of land at' Lanton, in the Parish of Jedburgh, which is called \" The Crowner's Lands.\" See, Crailing. NITH'S-DALE, the Western District or Stewartry of the Shire of Dumfries : and is so named from the river Nith, which flows through it.

NORTH-MAVEN, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 55\\ lambs of Teind, 881 ling, 6\\\\ lispunds of butter, corn Teind in the drawn sheaf valued at \u00a313..2..5f, and corn Teind in money \u00a34.. 11. .8. ; but there is no valu ation ofthe Teinds, and the drawn Teind must be variable : the glebe is situate in four different places, each three miles distant from the manse, and threo merks-land, which are contiguous to it: Patron, Lord Dundas: There have been two Churches in this Parish, each of them nearly in the middle of it, one on the East and the other on the West side : the former has been in ruins since the year 1761 ; the latter, at Hillswick, is now the only place of Public Worship ; it was re-built in the year 1733, and repaired in 1764 : the Manse, which is also at Hillswick, was built iu 1768, but not being completed, it had repairs in 1790, and is now pretty commodious. The Rev. William Jack, the Incumbent, be cause ofthe vast distance that many persons are from Hillswick, preaches three or four times a year at the North, and most distant part ofthe Parish, and also at Ollaberry, on the East side, the former place of Worship. It is in the Pres bytery of Shetland, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2045, and, in 1811, was 2024. It is a Peninsula, united to the Parish of Delting by a narrow Isthmus, about 100 yards broad at high water, called Mavis- grind ; but so low, that, at high spring tides, it is almost covered by the sea : from this narrow isthmus the ground rises nearly perpen dicularly. This Parish is 16 computed miles from North to South, and 8 miles from East to West : its shores are very uneven, being intersected with numerous inlets ofthe sea, called Voes, which afford safe harbours for the Fishing boats : the principal Bay, called St. Magnus Bay, is on the South side of the Parish, and leads to the Harbour and Creek of Hillswick, where there is safe and excel lent anchorage, for any number of vessels, or of any burden ; having good moor ings from 7 to 20 fathoms water : here is a large and commodious beach for drying fish, with good warehouses, and salt, and fish cellars, and every other necessary accommodation ; from this Creek, all the fish caught in the Parish,"], [493, "NOR are loaded for exportation. The Climate is mild, equal, and temperate ; and the air is pure, and healthy in all seasons. High and sudden winds are frequent. Rona's Hill, on the West side ofthe Parish, is elevated 3944 feet above the level of the sea, and is a well known landmark. This Parish is surrounded on all sides with small Islands, Holms, and Rocks ; but only one of these Islands is inhabited, which is called Lamba, and is situate to the Eastward. The cul tivated lands in this Parish, as well as in all Shetland, are scattered spots, en vironed either by deep mosses, or by thin bare grounds, from whence the moss has been taken for peats, or by steep hills covered with heath and naked rocks: these cultivated spots are called Rooms, which have, atan early period been divided into merks, but not equally : the value of each merk, being ascer tained by the number of pennies of rent by which it is denominated. Besides the various payments and stipulations of the Tenants to the Grantees of the Crown, the Incumbent is paid Cow and Sheep teind, and a composition of 15 lings for every six oared boat, and 10 lings for every four oared boat ; and further, the tenant pays to the Proprietor a Hen and Cock for every two merks land, and three days work to the Proprietor, and as many to the Minister, being maintained during that time. The cultivated lands bear a very small proportion to the hills and pas*ure ground. In the winter, the sheep and horses feed on sea-weed, and endure all the rigour of the season without shelter. A legal School was estab lished here, in 1772, with a Salary of 300 merks, raised by 2s. Bd. Scotch on the merk-land. Here are the remains of several Picts' Houses. The Ward-Hills, or Watch-Houses, are built within sight of the sea, and one or more within sight of each other : besides the purpose to which they might have been applied, in giving an alarm in times of danger, they are also supposed to have been used, to apprise and collect the inhabitants in the vicinity, when any shoals of small whales appeared ; and they are still appropriated to that purpose in The Taws Islands. The Northernmost point of the Parish is a small Peninsula, inclosed by a stone fence, called Fetheland ; and about three miles from thence, are three high rocks called Ramna- Stacks.

This is a populous Village. NORTON, v. RATHO. NORWICK, BAY, v. UNST, ISLAND. NOSS-HEAD, v. WICK. NOSS, ISLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of Bressay. It is situate on the South-East side of that Parish, and is one of the best and most fertile in Shetland, yielding particularly fine milk and butter for the table. Sailors unacquainted with the Coast, especially in thick weather, and in dark nights, are ready to mistake the opening between the Islands of Bressay and Noss, for the entrance to Bressay Sound: who, if they come too near the rocks, are in danger of being dashed to pieces. A Light upon Noss Head, which would be seen at a great distance, might prevent such disasters : it could be erected at no great expense ; and it is a matter of such serious im portance, that it deserves the most particular attention of Government. Near the Island of Noss, there is a Rock or Holm, perpendicular on all sides, and about 150 feet high : the opposite rock on the Island is nearly of equal height, and distant from the other about 240 feet. This Holm, which is quite level on the top, produces excellent grass, which maintains several sheep during the summer : and by means of ropes which are stretched across, from one side to the other, and upon which a wooden cradle slides along, a safe conveyance is effected between the Island and the Holm : this far-famed cradle, has here been em ployed beyond the memory of man ; and is mounted and dismounted twice a year, in order to save the rope or cable from the effect ofthe weather. The Isle of Noss is wholly the property of Mr. Mowat, of Garth ; it forms one large Farm, and is let at the annual rent of \u00a340..5..0., the tenant being allowed to exert himself in the fishing of tusk and ling for his own emolument. The Peak of Noss is a lofty eminence in the neighbourhood of Tlie Holm : upon Charts, this Peak is named Hangcliff, \u2014 a name unknown to the natives, and which, it is be lieved, was first imposed by The Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks, when on his voyage to Iceland : it is perhaps more than twice the height of Noss Holm, and yet from the sea to the summit, the rock is perfectly mural: at some points, however, even the timid may advance without difficulty so as to behold the white foam ofthe waves at its base, which here seem diminutive and noiseless: this"], [495, "OAT Cliff is composed of many successive sand-stone strata, and is the resort of scarfs or corvorants.

This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, and is watered by the river South Esk. The general appearance is flat, rising towards the South to the summit ofthe hill of Findhaven, which is elevated 1500 feet above the level of the adjacent country ; and upon which are the vestiges of a vitrified Fort. There were formerly the remains ofa large rectangular Camp, supposed to be the Roman Station Ad \u00c6sicam, the site of which includes nearly the whole Farm, called Battle-Dykes, now pronounced Black-Dykes : General Roy has preserved a plan of it, pi. 13. The soil is partly clay, and partly muiry : and the climate is cold, and moist. According to tradition, this was part ofa great Forest, called The Forest of Claton, which extended from Findhaven to Kirrie- Muir, about the distance of six miles. Some centuries ago, a great part of this County was in the possession ofthe Lindsays, whose Chief, The Earl ofQRAW ford, had his residence at Findhaven. vol. ii. 3 Q"], [496, "OCH * OBAN, in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle ; and in the Parish of Killmore : Here is a Chapel of Ease.

It is 6 m. N. b. W. from Elgin. Gordonstoivn, the fine seat of the ancient Baronet Family of Gordon, was purchased from The Marquis of Huntley, in 1639. Sir William Alexander, of Menstry, having undertaken to plant a Colony in Nova Scotia, in North America, in the year 1621, was joined in that enterprise by the Earls Marischal, Melrose, and Nid's-dale, Viscount Duplin, and the Lairds of Lochinvar, Lesmore, Clunie, and Gordonstown. For their en couragement, the King granted them severally, large districts of land in that Country, and proposed to create a new Title of Honour which should be Hered itary. This Order was erected in 1625, and besides the privileges common to the Order, Sir Robert Gordon's Patent, which is dated the 28th of May 1625, declares, That he is the First Knight of the Order, and that no one has had, or ever shall have the precedence of him : and 16,000 acres of land in Nova Scotia were granted to him and his heirs, with ample privileges.

It was here that James the Sixth lodged with his retinue, the first night after he left Edinburgh, on his journey to London, in 1603: andon his return, he was again received here, on the 17th of May 1617. This fort was, by accident or treachery, blown up in the year 1640, when Lord Hadington, and a number ofthe neighbouring gentlemen, perished in its ruins. It was made a Burgh of Barony, in 1489. The present Mansion is erected on the spot, where the Castle stood. Near it is the old Collegiate Church of Dunglass, which was built in 1450, by Sir Thomas Home, of that Ilk, and though not now used for the purpose for which it was originally intended, is still kept in good repair : it was founded for a Provost, and several Prebendaries.

The oats of this Parish are in high estimation : and, by the exam ple and encouragement of James Traill, Esq. , of Hobbester, Sheriff-Depute of the County, agriculture has lately been much improved here. Moss is not very abundant ; and the want of good peat fuel may be reckoned one of the greatest inconveniences under which the Inhabitants labour. Along the sea-coast, and towards the rising grounds, the air is pure and salubrious ; but, in the neigh bourhood of the marshes, it is unhealthy. The Loch of Duran, which is nearly three miles in circumference, is very capable of being drained. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, besides School-fees, and perquisites. The coast is rugged and shelving, but not bold ; and the Bay of Murkle might easily be made an excellent harbour, and at no great expense ; all kinds offish abound here, and the cod and ling fisheries are prosecuted with considerable success. Limestone, free-stone, grey slates of a light durable kind, and blue flags of an uncommonly good quality, are in plenty. Here are the remains of several Picts' Houses; and on the summit of the Hill of Olrick, are evident vestiges of an ancient Watch-Tower, from whence the prospect is very extensive, Murkle or Mort- Hill, the Seat of Sir Robert Sinclair, Bart., is supposed to take its name from a great battle fought there betw-een the Danes and the Natives, in which the latter were victorious : There were formerly great buildings here, which were supposed to be those of an ancient Nunnery; and Torf\u00e6us says, that a Queen of Norway lived some time at Murkle; it was a Seat of the late Earl of Caithness. Castle-Hill, the residence of Mr. Traill, is so called from an old Castle, of which scarcely a vestige is now discernible ; and from the rising pros perity of the Tenantry on this estate, owing solely to the humane and judicious conduct of the Proprietor, it may be hoped, that every Heritor in Caithness, will adopt similar measures for the improvement of their estates, and the happi ness of their people. OMISTON-HILL, v. KIRK-NEWTON. OMOA IRON WORKS, v. SHOTTS. ONCAN, in The Isle of Man : The Church is dedicated to St. Onca, the mother of St. Patrick, and in the Church-yard the Aliens who die in Douglas are usually interred.

BRACADALE. ORANSAY, ISLE, one ofthe Hebrides, v. SLEAT. ORCADES, the ancient name of The ORKNEY ISLANDS. ORCHARD NOOK, v. RHYND. ORD, The, in the Shire of Caithness. According to Mr. Nimmo, the Shire of Caithness is divided from the Shire of Sutherland by an elevated chain of hills, running nearly parallel to the rivers Hallowdale and Helmsdale, and terminating in the Mountain, named The Ord. This range commences in the Parish of Reay ; nearly halfway between the Kirk of Reay and the river Hallowdale, in a ridge called Drim Hallistin, the boundary proceeds Southwards by the summit level to the sources of the rivers Halloiodale, Forse, and Tliurso, where it meets the cen tral chain of Sutherland. Continuing in this direction, we find Strath Ellie in the Shire of Sutherland, and the waters of Langwcll and Berriedale in the Shire of Caithness. The Boundary, therefore, proceeds along the ridge parallel to and about three miles distant from the Helmsdale river, by the summits of Morbheim Scurabein, &c, to The Ord. At The Ord, there is a tract of disputed ground. Both sides claim \" The Burn ofthe Ord,\" as their Boundary; and the question is, which of two streams is to be considered as this Burn 1 It was lately the subject of a Lawsuit between the parties. Beneath this Cape are immense caves, the resort of seals, and sea-fowls ; and the sides and summit being chiefly covered with heath and morassy earth, give it a black and melan choly aspect. An excellent line of road has been made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, from The Ord of Caithness to Dunbeath, and from thence to the town of Wick, a distance of 34f miles. ORDEQUHILL, i. e. The Hollow beside the Height, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Chapelry, the Stipend of which, in 1811, including the glebe, was about \u00a370. Sterling: the manse, and offices, are in bad repair: Patron, The Earl of Seafield, who pays most ofthe Stipend, although he has not an acre of ground in the Parish : The Church was built about the year 1622, on the spot where then stood St. Mary's Chapel, and is now in a ruinous state. It is in- the Presbytery of Fordyce, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of"], [502, "O R K this Parish, iu 1801, (containing the Village of Cornhill) was 510, and, in 1811, was 521. It is 11 m. S. W. from Banff. This was formerly a Chapelry in the Parish of Fordyce, where Divine Service was performed once a Month : and seems to have been erected into a separate Parish, about the year 1622. It is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth : the face ofthe country is wildly beautiful, and corresponds exactly with the signification ofthe name given to it : about two-thirds of the Parish are arable, the remainder being partly covered with heath. The soil is, in general, deep, and good, but cold and wet at the bottom. Many extensive Plantations have of late been made by Sir Ernest Gordon, Bart., of Park, who is sole Proprietor, and is generally resident ; and whose elegant and commodious Mansion is fitted up in a superior style. Here are several excellent Mineral wells, which were formerly much frequented ; and one of them, being dedicated to The Virgin Mary, was, at certain seasons, greatly resorted to by the superstitious, as well as the sick. The air is particularly salubrious ; and the inhabitants are healthy, hospitable, and industrious. The peat mosses are very extensive. Near the Village of Cornhill, during the Sum mer season, there are annually holden some well frequented Markets. The Salary of the Schoolmaster is 300 merks, and a rood of land, together with School-fees, and a few small perquisites. Servitudes are exacted. The Knock Hill, which is elevated about 2500 feet above the level of the sea, is a well known landmark to the Vessels that trade in the Moray Firth ; the Parishes of Grange, Fordyce, and Ordequhill, meet on its summit ; and, on the very spot of their union, is a terminus or mark, from whence is one ofthe most grand, beau tiful, and variegated Prospects North of the Tweed ;\u25a0 this is supposed to be the real Mons Grampius, of Richard of Cirencester. Mr. Walter Goodall, author of \" A Defence of Mary Queen of Scots,\" published in 1750 in two volumes 8vo., was a native of this Parish: and he also assisted Mr. Thomas Ruddiman, in several of his productions. The new turnpike road between Portsoy, and Huntley, runs through this Parish. OR1NSAY, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of North Uist. This is an Island only at high water, and is half a mile long. The soil is sandy for the most part, but fertile in favourable seasons. ORKNEY, ISLANDS, these are the Orcades ofthe ancients, and form the Southern division of TheNorthern Isles of Scotland, being separated from the Main-land by the Pentland Firth. These Islands are upwards of thirty in number ;"], [503, "O R K but many of them are uninhabited, being small, and appropriated to the past urage of Sheep. The whole District is divided into 27 Parishes ; the Resi dent Population of which, in 1801, was 24,445, and, in 1811, was 23,238. Agriculture is much neglected here, on account ofthe fisheries, and the manu facture of kelp. The climate is moist and cold, and during the winter months any communication between them and the Main-land is very precarious. Game is abundant ; eagles are numerous, and the King's Falconer visits the Islands annually, for the young hawks and falcons. The coast abounds with fish of all kinds ; and the precipices, during the seasdn of incubation, swarm with myriads of sea-fowls. The language is English, with the Scottish pronunciation and idiom. The Heritable property may be considered as divided into, First, The King's Lands, \u2014 Secondly, The Kirk Lands, \u2014 and, Thirdly, Udal Lands. The rents of the first, being demesne lands, were anciently paid to the Sovereign ; but these, in process of time, were feued by the Crown in parcels to Tenants, for payment ofthe old Rental. The Kirk Lands were in similar circumstances, having been feued from the Church by Ecclesiastics or Churchmen, at the for mer Rental. The Udal is a peculiar tenure for some of the Crown Lands, which prevails only in The Barony of The Four Towns of Lochmaben, and in The Islands of Orkney and Shetland. The lands which are holden by this tenure, are said to have been granted by Olaus, one ofthe Norwegian kings, upon con dition of receiving one-third of the produce ; and the property devolved in suc cession, without charter or seizin, from either the Sovereign or Superior; but the conditional payment of one-third ofthe produce is now given up, and at pre sent some ofthe Udal Lands pay a small rent to the Crown : some of them pay to the Church, and others are totally exempted. The Udal rights were renewed by James the Sixth and Charles the Second, and confirmed by The Court of Session, and a decree of The British House of Peers, in 1726 and 1727. The commerce ofthe Orkneys is likely to be much increased by the late improve ments in the Harbour of Kirkwall. These Islands were probably first sub dued by Julius Agricola : on the subversion of the Pictish Kingdom by Kenneth the Second, they became annexed to the Scottish Monarchy until the year 1099, when they were assigned by King Donald Bane to the King of Norway, for the assistance which he had received from that King in his Usurpa tion. They remained in possession of the Nortvegians until the middle of the Thirteenth Century, when Magnus, King of Norway, transferred them to Alex ander, King of Scotland, who gave them to a Nobleman, surnamed Spiere, vol. jk 3K"], [504, "O R M an heiress of whose family brought them to the Sinclairs, or St. Clairs, one of whom was created Prince of Orkney and Duke of Oldenburgh, upon his marriage with a daughter ofthe King of Denmark. One of his Successors hav ing forfeited, the litle and estate fell to the Crown ; but the Islands were of small advantage to the Scots, being often disturbed in their possession by the Norive gians, who again asserted their right of Sovereignty, and often recovered them, until the year 1470, when James the Third of Scotland marrying Margaret daughter of the King of Norway, they again passed with her to the Crown of Scotland in lieu of dowry ; and, upon the birth of her son, they were finally ceded. The Danes, however, continued to have pretensions to the Orkneys, which were never totally abandoned, until James the Sixth marrying Anne daughter of the King of Denmark, the possession was ultimately recognised in favour of the Scottish Crown. In 1567, Queen Mary advanced James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, her third husband, to the dignity of Duke of Orkney, which was forfeited in 1577. In 1581, James the Sixth created Patrick Stewart, a natu ral son of James the Fifth, Earl of Orkney, which he also forfeited in 1614. In 1689, the title of Earl was revived in the Illustrious House of Hamilton, with whom it still remains. The Isles of Orkney and Shetland constitute one Stew artry, and send one Member to the Imperial Parliament. The right of Supe riority to the Orkneys was dismembered from the Crown by The Union Par liament, and granted for a certain yearly consideration to The Earl of Morton, who was by Queen Anne appointed Hereditary Steward and Justiciary. Upon the Abolition of Heritable Jurisdictions in 1748, the appointment ofthe Steicard became vested in the Crown ; but, as The Earl of Morton possessed the Patron age of the Stewartry, that Nobleman long retained the office of Steward and Sheriff. The Superiority of these Islands was afterwards acquired by purchase from The Earl of Morton by Thomas Lord Dundas, who still possesses it, too-e ther with the right of patronage to all the Parishes of the Stewartry, except two. His Lordship is authorized to create particular Magistrates, called Bailiffs; of whom there is one in every Island and Parish, who have power to superintend the manners ofthe Inhabitants, to hold courts, and determine civil causes, ac cording to the Law of Scotland, to the value of 16s. 8d.

The village of Ormiston is neatly built on a rising ground, upon a dry gravelly soil, and in the middle of the street is an ancient Cross. About two miles South from the Church, on the summit of Dodridge Law, are the remains ofa Danish Camp. This Parish gave birth to the Cockburns, of Ormiston, celebrated as Statesmen and Lawyers ; they were early in possession of the Manor ; which, in 1747, John Cockburn, Lord Justice Clerk, sold toge ther with the Patronage of the Church to John Earl of Hopetoun, who then became Proprietor of the whole Parish. Near the village, is Ormiston Hall, a beautiful Seat of The Earl of Hopetoun ; in the garden of which is a Yetv Tree of remarkable size, its trunk being 11 feet in circumference, and 25 feet in length, and it is still growing in full vigour : it is supposed to be upwards of 300 years old.

This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and from two to three miles in breadth, and contains about 12,800 acres. The East side of it, for some length, is at first sight very unpromising, bleak and barren, the soil a broken Peat-moss cut down from time to time for fuel, or washed off by the rains ; here and there a solitary patch of cultivated land, with a few dreary straggling houses, and the surface 3R2"], [508, "O R P even scantily covered with heath : but the centre of the Parish makes ample amends for this scene of sterility ; in advancing to the Westward, the soil improves first into a mixture of moss, and clay; then into one compounded of sand, clay, and gravel ; and at last it discovers a rich loam, that predominates over a large tract in the middle district. The grain raised here, more on account ofthe excellence ofthe soil than the skill ofthe Farmers, is rather better than in some other places ; and what adds to the same effect, is their making use of compost manure in preference to sea- weed, which is known, where-ever it is used solely, to spoil the quality ofthe grain. Besides cultivating their little farms, the ordi nary employment of the people is to furnish Peat to some of the neighbouring districts that are in want of this article, and to burn a little Kelp in the season : and while they are employed occasionally through the whole year in catching cooths or sillocks, properly coal-fish, a part of their time in summer is spent in fishing the dog-fish, for obtaining its oil. Mackrel, and Herrings, often visit these coasts ; the former of which are sometimes caught in small numbers, but the latter, either from want of skill, industry or capital, are suffered to pass by in myriads: but this great neglect of what might contribute so much, not only to their wealth, but their comfort, is so far from being confined to the Parish of Orphir, that it attaches equally to the other inhabitants of Orkney. Besides these and many other kinds offish, they have Trout in the Loch of Kirbister or Waukmillin abundance, which is perhaps the reason that Otters haunt it sq often, and with so much seeming satisfaction. Here is a Chalybeate spring, called Tlie Water of Scoridale, in the virtues of which they place such implicit confi dence, as supersedes the necessity of medicine. The Name of this Parish is said to be compounded of the Norwegian words, Jord, Land, and Fior, Fire : and this Etymology is the more probable, as the Parish of Orphir serves the neigh bouring towns of Kirkwall and Stromness with a species of Peats, distinguished by the name of Yarfo, i. e. Fire-land, or earth fit for burning : and to the present day, there is a House and District called Yarfo, from its neighbourhood to a large moss of this description. A Harbour, fit only for small ships, at Howton, is the only one in the Parish ; but it has acquired celebrity from being the scene of some remarkable transactions, when the Parish contained the Palace, and was the chief residence of Earl Paul, and other ancient Counts of Orkney. From the high ground to the North, called Tlie Wart or Warder Hill, and near the place where that Palace is supposed to have been situate, there is a view as extensive as it is pleasant. The shore, except in the Bays, is in general bold,"], [509, "O R W consisting of rocks from 40 to 50 feet high, and composed partly of whin, but chiefly of free-stone : and the water, within a gun-shot of the shore, is from 12 to 20 fathoms deep. Here are a few Slates, of an inferior quality, and some excellent Flags : some coal-stone has been discovered, and there is abundance of iron-ore, but no attempts have been made to work them : there is plenty of blue stone, fit for building, and also of free-stone beautifully variegated. There are numerous Barrows or Tumuli, but none of them have been opened. Here is a Parochial School, the salary of which is 300 merks, and a small House. The false Weights and Measures of this County have long been a source of grievance and complaint ; and, in no instance, is the oppression more glaring than in the measure of Peats paid here by the Tenants, under the denomination of a Fathom. The ancient Proprietors of this Parish were the Halcros, the Sinclairs, and the Stewarts. The only considerable Proprietor at present is William Honyman, Esq., of Gr\u00e6msay, a Gentleman possessed ofthe largest property in this County, next to Lord Dundas, and lineally descended from Andrew Honyman, Bishop of Orkney, whom he has the honour to represent. In the Church-yard are the re mains of an ancient Building, called The Girth-House, to which great antiquity is ascribed. It is a Rotundo of 18 feet in diameter, and 20 feet high ; open at the top ; and, on the East side, is a vaulted concavity, where probably the Altar stood, with an opening in the wall to admit the light; two-thirds of it have been taken down to repair the Parish Church : the walls are thick, and consist of stones, strongly cemented with lime : from its resemblance to the Pantheon, some per sons have ascribed this building to the Romans ; but, in all probability, it has been a Popish Chapel, dedicated by the Piety of its founder to some favourite Saint. For his unwearied endeavours to improve the Morals, and to cultivate the minds of his Parishioners, The Reverend Mr. Liddell, the present worthy Minister, deserves the best thanks ofthe Public ; and especially for his manly and patriotic proceedings in the suppression ofthe baneful practice of Smuggling here.

This Parish is generally known by the name of the Village, Milln-athwart, which is perfectly expressive of its real situation ; a mill being placed upon a small rivulet, which nearly divides it into two equal parts. It is between 5 and 6 miles in length, and about 5 miles in breadth: the greater part ofthe surface is flat, rising gradually towards the Ochil Hills : the soil is mostly fertile, and nearly two-thirds are inclosed. There are four free-stone Quarries, ofa good quality. The public Roads, and Bridges, are in excellent order. The Quiech is the largest rivulet ; which, flowing from the West, terminates in Loch Leven. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees and emoluments, and a School house and room, built in 1769. The climate is very salubrious. Coals are the fuel principally used ; and which are brought from Kelty, about 6 miles distant. In the Eastern part ofthe Parish, near the foot of the Lomond Hills, are the ruins of The Castle of Burleigh, formerly the residence ofthe Lords Burleigh, and which appears to have been a place of great strength.

It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Dolphiston, Mossburn-Ford, Newbiggin, Oxnam, Plenderleith, and Swinside) was 688, and, in 1811, was 727. It is 4 m. S. E. from Jedburgh. This Parish is of an irregular rectangular figure, 9f miles in length, by 5 miles in breadth, except at one place, where it is only 2 miles broad. The general appearance is rather bleak, and hilly ; but the hills are of small elevation, and most of them are covered with green pasture: The soil is various, and it is principally uninclosed. The air is often moist, by the frequent rains from all directions, and, in particular, from the East. It is watered by numerous rivulets, especially the Coquet, the Jed, the Kail, and the Oxnam, all of which abound with Trout of an excellent quality ; though, in point of quan- tity, the Coquet is the most distinguished, and also affords a Salmon fishery. There is a Chalybeate Spring near Fairloans, on the South end ofthe Parish, but it is not in much repute. Game abounds here ; amongst which may be enumerated the beautiful Black-Cock, and Grouse. There is a remarkably distinct Echo from the Church to a small eminence, 170 yards directly East from it, in the level of the Gallery. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, together with \u00a34.. 3..4., interest of money mortified by Lady Yester, for teaching poor Children, and perquisites. Dame Margaret Ker, Lady Yester, by her Letters of Mortification, dated the 4th of November 1630, and the 14th of March 1638, caused a School to be built, and a Schoolmaster's House, at Oxnam Bridge-End, and little Dwelling-houses, for accommodating four poor people, commonly called Alms Houses, at Oxnam Rawfoot ; and like- wise mortified \u00a31000.

The Harvest begins, for the most part, with September ; and the produce far exceeds the consumption of the Inhabit- ants. On the upper end of this, and ofthe neighbouring Parishes which border on Northumberland, the Sheep have been greatly improved of late. Here is also a good breed of Horses. There are the remains of various military operations : the great Roman road from Borough-bridge to the Lothians byBoswell's Green, is the Eastern boundary of the Parish, and runs the whole length of it. Several years ago, a Head-piece of plate Iron, supposed to be Roman, was turned up by the plough in a field belonging to Cap-hope, on the North point of the Parish ;"], [512, "O Y N and, in the Autumn of 1791, a shilling of Robert Bruce was discovered in a garden at Newbiggin. The people are industrious, sober, and \u0153conomical ; they are friendly to each other, and hospitable to strangers. There is a tradition, that, during the animosities between England and Scotland, one of the principal Bells, now in the Cathedral of Durham, was carried from this Parish : certain it is, that Oxnam is inscribed upon it ; but whether it be the name of this Parish, or ofthe Founder, is not known: some persons are of opinion, that as Oxnam was subject to the Abbacy of Jedburgh, The Crag Tower might have been a Religious House, and that this Bell was hung upon.it. On Millheugh-Farm, there is a Hillock, called Gallala-Know, which is reported to have been used in the Border wars, as a place of Execution. Many buildings, called Peels} are scattered over the country, and especially on the Borders. On the forfeiture of Sir Robert Colvill, David the Second granted the Barony ofOxenham to Duncan Wallace. The strong banks ofthe Oxenham water were of old covered by impervious fastnesses, which were called The Henwood ; and which furnished a Rendezvous, for the Border warriors, when invaded by their \" an cient adversaries :\" And this commodious circumstance, says Mr. Chalmers, gave rise to the war-cry, \" A Henwoody ! A Henicoody !\" which made every heart burn with ardour, every hand grasp a weapon, and every foot hasten to Henwoood.

It is in the Presbytery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 518, and, in 1811, was 564. It is 2 ra. S. from Old Rayne. This Parish is from 3 to 4 miles in length, and the same in breadth. It is watered by the Don, the Ury, the Shevock, and the Gady ; along the banks of which, the soil is ex tremely fertile, and early. The roads are bad. The high multures at the mills are loudly and justly complained of, as a great bar to agriculture. The air is pure, and healthy. Peats, and turfs, from the high Mountain of Bennochie, are the common fuel. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. Here are two Druidical tem ples. There are considerable plantations around the Mansion-Houses of West hall, Tillyfovr, and Pittodry ; the latter of which, is an elegant building, and the residence of Colonel Knight Erskine."], [513, "P A I P JtABAY, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness: it constitutes part of the Parish of Barray, from which it is 8 miles distant, to the Southward.

PABAY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part of the Parish of Harris. This Island is of a conical appearance, and rises to a Peak considerably higher than any part ofthe other Islands in the Sound. Its greatest diameter is about 2\\ miles. This was once the Granary of Harris, but it has lost much of its fertility by the encroachment of the sand drift, which now covers its South-East side to the very summit, exhibiting a most desolate appearance : The South-West side is verdant, and well cultivated : The North-West side, being exposed to the Atlantic, yields little or no vegeta tion, as the spray of the sea, in stormy weather, washes over it. Divine Service is performed here only once a Quarter. PABAY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part of the Parish of Strath, from which it is distant about two-thirds ofa mile, to the Eastward. This is a low Island, used only as a wintering place for cattle; but it has a valuable kelp shore. The blue lime-stone rock here, and on the opposite shore of Skye, abounds in petrifactions. PAISLEY, in the Shire of Renfrew. This Town continued a part of the Original or The Abbey Parish of Paisley, until the year 1738, when the Magis trates and Council having purchased the right of Patronage from the then Earl of Dundonald, a new Church was built, and the Town was erected into a sepa rate Parish ; in 1756, another Church was built upon a very extended plan, to accommodate its multiplied inhabitants; and, in 1781, the number of inhab itants still rapidly increasing, a third Church was built, not quite so large as the former, but very handsomely and elegantly finished ; and, in the following year, the Town was divided, and erected into three separate Parishes, viz., The Low Church, The High Church, and The Middle Church Parishes. The three Parishes are an area of about a mile and a half square, taken out of the old vol. ii. 3 S"], [514, "PAN original Parish, by which they are bounded ; and the Stipend of each Minister is \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe.

The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the third Thursday in February, the third Thursday in May, the second Thursday in August, and the second Thursday in November. The Old Town of Paisley is pleasantly situate on the West bank ofthe river WhUe- Car/,and is one ofthe most considerable manufacturing Towns in Scotland. In 1488, it was erected into a Burgh of Barony by James the Fourth, under the Superiority of George Shaw, then Abbot of the Monastery, and is governed by three Baillies, the oldest of whom is commonly in the Commission of the Peace, a Treasurer, Town-Clerk, and 17 Counsellors, who are annually elected on the first Monday aster Michael mas : but it is not represented in Parliament. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. The river Cart, over which there are three stone Bridges, is navigable for small vessels up to the Town. The Public Grammar School is ably conducted ; besides which, there is an established English School in each of the three Parishes, that are well attended; and, as each Master is Session Clerk of the Parish to which he belongs, the emoluments of the two offices afford a decent and comfortable living. The water is indifferent ; but it has lately been much improved, by being filtered through gravel. PAISLEY, ABBEY, v. ABBEY PARISH of PAISLEY. PALACE-BRAE, v. BLAIRINGONE.

E. from Muir-Drum. This Parish is about 5\\ miles in length, aud 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the coast, at the mouth of the Firth of Tay. The general appearance is level, with a considerable declivity for some miles from the North towards the German Ocean. The shore is flat, and very rocky. The soil is various ; being sandy on the coast, loam or clay in the interior, and muiry in its Northern extremity. The House of Panmure, the property of The Hon. William Ramsay Maule, is surrounded with extensive inclosures and plantations : and near it, are the vaults and found ations of the old Castle of Panmure, long the seat of the Earls of that name. The ancestors of Hector Boethius or Boece, were for several generations Lairds of the Barony of Panbride; and, it is generally said, that that Historian was born in this Parish ; but this report is incorrect, as he was born at Dundee, 12 miles distant from Panbride, in the year 1470.

PAPA STOUR, ISLAND, one ofthe Shetland Isles: formerly a Vicarage, constituting part of the Union of Walls : The Church is in bad repair. This Island is two miles in length, and somewhat more than one mile in breadth ; and lies at the distance of one mile West from the Mainland. It is flat, and extremely agreeable in Summer. When the season is mild, it produces very abundant crops ofbear, oats, and potatoes : and the pasturage is excellent. It, however, labours under two great disadvantages ; the Scatald or Common is very small, and the fuel is neither good, nor plentiful. A Light-House here would be of great service. It has several small Voes or Inlets ofthe sea, which serve as secure Harbours for Fishing sloops, during the summer. There are some beaches in this Island, where the fish are cured ; and convenient houses have been erected by the proprietor, and are let annually at a moderate rent. A Charity School has also been established, with a legal Salary of \u00a310. Sterling per annum.

This is a pleasant little Island, situate within half a mile of Stronsay, on the North-East, and gives name to the channel which separates them, called Papa Sound. Its circumference is about three miles ; and, as it is of a level surface, distinguished alike for its beauty and fertility, it furnishes a very comfortable abode for a pretty extensive Farmer, with his servants and other dependants, who make a part ofthe Congregation of Stronsay. Even in this small place, there were formerly two Chapels for Religious Wor ship, one of them dedicated to St. Bride, and the other to St. Nicholas. In the middle ofthe space between these, is an eminence, known by the name of EarVs Knoll, upon which are still apparent some old ruins and graves. There are two entrances into Papa Sound, one from the North-West, which is the widest and safest ; and the other, from the East ; a stranger, however, would require a Pilot, as the West channel is intricate, and the East one is narrow and danger ous : small Vessels can ride here in safety at all seasons. PAPA WESTRAY, ISLAND, one of the Orkneys : a Chapelrv, annexed to the United Vicarages of St. Mary, and Cross Kirk, in the Island of Westray. It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. It is 24 m. N. from Kirkwall. This beautiful little Island is situate on the North-East side of Westray, and is separated from it by a Sound or ferry, between two and three miles broad. Its length is between three and four miles ; the form is oval, and it lies in a direction from North to South, being about an English mile in breadth in most places: the land rises gently towards the middle, and shelves towards the sea on both sides, till it terminates towards the North, in what is well known by the name of The Mull of Papa. This is a very fertile Island, containing some ofthe best pasture and arable lands in the whole County. About 70 tons of kelp are made here annually. Here is a water-mill. In a beautiful Loch of fresh water, at the South-East corner of the Island, is a small Isle, little larger than is sufficient to serve for the foundation ofa Picts House, and on which was afterwards erected the once noble Chapel of St. Tredwall; but the wonders which superstition formerly fabricated, and ascribed to this Female Saint, are no longer believed here. The Resident Population of this Island, in 1801, was 200, and, in 1811, was 211. It is excellently adapted for the prosecution ofthe white Fishery, a fine cod bank being situate about two English miles only off Tlie Mull Head: but this field of industry, and source of wealth, is at present entirely neglected. The whole Island is the properly of one Gentleman, who is resident, in the midst of many contented, though poor, cottars ; whose happiness"], [517, "PAR it is his study to promote, and with whom he mingles with the most perfect familiarity.

This Parish is of a square form, comprehending about 20 square miles. The surface is very unequal ; but none of the eminences deserve the name of mountains : the flats and bilk are generally covered with heath, except the cultivated lands on the banks of the river Ken, which unites with the Dee about half a mile above the Church ; and from whence it is denominated the Dee, until it enters the Solway Firth at Kirkcudbright ; it abounds in pike, and perch.

It has long been famous for the manufacture of Nails: the weaving of linen is also introduced. A Fair used to be holden here annually, for white cloth and wool, but it is now little resorted to. Here is also a good Market for Butchers' meat. There are several private Schools. The Castle of Raven's- Craig, which is situate upon a rock, projecting into the Firth of Forth, was given by James the Third to William St. Clair, Earl of Orkney, with the adjacent lands, when he resigned the title of Orkney. It has ever since been possessed by the family of St. Clair. It was inkafcUod during the usurpation of Oliver Cromwell, and was fixed upon by a party of his troops : but it has, for many years since, been uninhabited, and is now in a ruinous state.

The Landward part of the Parish extends from East to West 5-J miles, and from North to South 10 miles, and contains 18,210 acres. The river Tweed, running through it from West to East, divides it into nearly equal parts."], [520, "PEE Peebles, called also Edlestowe Water, subdivides the North part of it. The Royal Burgh of Peebles stands in the centre, and in a situation remarkably pleasant. It is built in a beautiful and healthy opening, with a hilly country around. The soil is dry, and fertile ; and the climate is salubrious. Improvements in agri culture have of late years made a rapid progress in this Parish ; 1500 acres have been inclosed for some time, and 700 acres of In-field ground were lately inclosed: of Out-field ground, which is sometimes in tillage, but more com monly in natural grass, for pasturing cows and horses, there are 800 acres : the other lands, being hilly, afford excellent pasture for sheep, and are conse quently employed for that purpose. The Peebles grey pea has long been in high estimation all over the country, for seed ; as are also the oats. As The Burgh constitutes the greatest part ofthe Parish, the Magistrates and Council have al ways appointed Schoolmasters for the use of the whole Parish ; one for teaching the Grammar, another the English School, and have provided them with proper Houses, and Salaries. Private Schools also have long existed, and of late have become rivals for fame with the public ones. Poor children are educated by the Kirk-session from the Poor's funds, and no part of them is more properly applied. At present, Peebles is a place of considerable consequence, from its woollen, and other manufactures ; and it has also become famous for the excellence of its Beer. From the earliest records it appears, that Peebles was a Town of the Royal demesne, which yielded a firm into the Exchequer. The Kings resided, occasionally, at Peebles, until the sad demise of Alexander the Third, who left it various marks of his munificence. On the 20th of September 1367, David the Second granted a Charter to Peebles, which made it a Royal Borough ; this was confirmed by a Charter of James the Second, and by another, from King James the Sixth, in 1621. Robert Bruce granted it a free Market. The Baronial Family of Hay, of Yester, enjoyed the office of Sheriff of Peebles, throughout three centuries, till John, the second Earl of Tweeddale, sold it, in 1686, with his whole estates in Tweeddale, to William Duke of Queensberry, who settled the office and Estates on his second Son, The Earl of Marc^i. In 1724 The Earl of March was Hereditary Sheriff of Peebles ; which office he held until the abolition of heritable Jurisdictions in 1748; when His Lordship claimed for the Sheriff ship of Peebles \u00a34000.; for the Regality of Newlands \u00a31500. ; and he was allowed for both of them \u00a33418..4..5. James Montgomery, of the Family of Magbie-Hill, who rose to be Chief Baron ofthe Exchequer, was appointed the first Sheriff of the Shire of Peebles, after the abolition of the heritable Sheriff-"], [521, "PEE doms, at the Salary of \u00a3150. per annum. That there was a Church here, belonging to the ancient Episcopate of Glasgow, at the commencement of the Twelfth century, is certain : and in it, the Bishops of Glasgow used some times to hold their Synods. Until the Reformation, the Archdeacon of Glasgow was Rector of Peebles, and of Manor; and enjoyed of course the Parsonage Tythes of those Parishes, which are said to have been worth annually 6000 merks : at that epoch of Ecclesiastical change, a part of the Vicarage Tythes (the Rectory having been converted into a Vicarage, about the year 1260) Was assigned, by the Patron of the Parish, to the Master of the Grammar School here. There were formerly three Churches, and several Chapels within the Town, and Parish. The High Church of Peebles, which was dedicated to Tlie Virgin Mary, is supposed to have been erected, or rather re-built, in the Eleventh century : from the appearance of some ofthe free-stone, it should seem to have succeeded a Church more ancient. King David granted to the Chap lains of St. Mary's Church, the corn, and the fulling mills of Inver-Leithen, with extensive multures, and the adjacent lands. The ruins of this ancient Church still remain, at the Western extremity of The Old Town, and are sur rounded by a large Cemetery, which continues to be used. \u2014 The Cross Kirk owed its foundation to the superstition of the times. On the discovery of the remains ofa human body, on the 7th of May 1621, according to Fordun, that had been cut in pieces, and buried in a shrine of stone, and ofa magnificent and venerable Cross deposited near it, bearing the name of St. Nicholas, it was be lieved, that St.Nicolaus, of the Order of the Culdees, and who was said to have suffered Martyrdom about the end ofthe Third century, during the Dioclesian and Maximian persecution, had been buried in that place. About the year 1257, Alexander the Third, at the request of William then Bishop of Glas gow, to which Diocese Peebles belonged, erected on this sacred site a large Conventual Church, which he dedicated to God and The Holy Cross, and called it, The Cross Kirk of Peebles; It was of the Order of Churches, called Ministries, and contained 70 Red or Trinity Friars: an Order instituted in honour of The Holy Trinity, and for the redemption of Christians who were made Slaves by the Turks, to which a third part of their yearly income was to be applied : besides other endowments, its Royal Founder gave to The Cross Kirk, about 50 acres of excellent land, lying around it. Friar Thomas, its Min ister, was Chaplain to King Robert the Second, who gave to it the lands, called Tlie King's Meadow, juxtavillam de Peebles, from whence it is probables, that vol ii. 3 T"], [522, "PEE Peebles was not as yet erected into a Royal Burgh. \u2014 A mile and a half below Peebles, stood the Hospital of St. Leonard's, called afterwards by corruption, Chapel Yards, which was founded for infirm and indigent Persons. In 1427, James the First gave this Hospital to his Confessor David Rat, ofthe Order of the Preachers ; a probable Evidence, that James lived frequently at Peebles, and wrote there his Poem, intituled, \" Peebles, to the Play,\" in which he repre sents a great annual Festival of music, diversions, and feasting, that had long been in use to be holden at Peebles, attended by multitudes from The Forth, and The Forest, in their best apparel. The time of this Festival was at Beal tine, which, in the Gaelic language, signifies The fire of Bell or Baal, because on the First day of May, tbe heathens, by kindling fires and offering sacrifices upon eminences or the summits of mountains, held their great anniversary Fes tival in honour of the Sun, whose benign influence on all nature begun to be strongly felt at this time. The name Bealtine-day, continued and gave desig nation to the Bealtine Fair of Peebles, long aster the religion ofthe country, and the festivals of the season, were changed. \" At Beltane, quhen ilk bodie bownis To Peblis to the Play, To heir the singin and the soundis ; The solace, suth to say.\" \u2014 The Kings of Scotland made Peebles their usual summer residence, for rural diversion or the administration of justice: Many ofthe Nobility accompanied them, whose Houses in Peebles still bear their names. Extensive lands all around, were afterwards granted by Royal Charter in property or commonty to the Burgh. Cadmuir, Hornidoan, Venlaw, and Glentorie, were the King's property and hunting grounds. On the South East of Peebles, and the other side ofthe river, is the Gallows- Hill, where criminals were executed. On the King's Moor, between that place and Peebles, the ancient Tournaments were exhibited : There the County Militia amounting commonly to 300 Horsemen, muster every year at their Weapon- Shawing, in the months of June, and October: and there Horse-Races continued to be holden at Bealtine, till the middle of the last Century; and lately, when a part of that Moor was converted from its original to a more improved state, there was disco vered in a Cairn of stones, a Roman Urn inverted, containing the blade of a dagger, and pieces of human bones and ashes. \u2014 The Town of Peebles"], [523, "PEE originally extended from Edlestown Water Westward to The Meadow Well Strand, the Cross standing opposite to Ludgate. It was several times plund ered and burnt by the English ; so that nothing was left undestroyed but the Churches, the Manse, and the Cross, which being holden sacred, were com monly spared. This induced the inhabitants to build a Neio Town on the East side of that water, as being a situation more easily fortified, and to surround it with strong walls and gates, which continued till the Union of the two King doms. In consideration of these great losses, and that the Town of Peebles had always been distinguished for loyalty, fidelity, and good services, not only the usual privileges of Royal Boroughs, but the extensive lands already men tioned, and a Toll on the Bridge of Tweed, were, by Royal Charters,granted to it at the Reformation of Religion in Scotland in the year 1560, when the needless multiplicity of Churches was abolished, and Convents were dis solved. The High Church in the Old Town was demolished : And, The Cross Church, as being nearer to the New Town, was converted into the Parochial one, and employed in the offices of Reformed Religion until January 1784, when The New Church having been built within the Town, was opened for Religious worship by The Rev. William Dalgliesh, D. D. The Cloister was converted into Houses for the School-masters, and Public Schools, and was used for these purposes till the beginning of the Eighteenth Century, when it became ruinous. In the Church of The Holy Rood, as well as in the Church of St. Andrew, there were established a number of Chap lainries and Altarages, with endowments of lands, all of which were granted to the Community of Peebles, in 1621 : paying a small annual rent into the Exchequer, and offering their daily prayers for King James, the grantor, and his successors. The Castle of Peebles had of old a Chapel, which was granted, in the Twelfth century, to the Monks of Kelso, with a carucate of land adjacent, and ten shillings outof the firm ofthe Town. There was also, in Peebles, a Cha pel which had been dedicated to The Virgin Mary, and which was usually called Lady Chapel: And there was likewise a Chapel, at a place, which was called from it Chapel Hill, upon Peebles Water, about a mile and a half above the Town. Numerous vestiges of antiquity still remain in this Parish, and in the neighbourhood. At Lyne, four miles West from Peebles, is a distinct Roman Castra Stativa, 500 feet square, with two ditches and three ramparts, containing between six and seven acres. Three miles South from this Camp, and on the 3T2"], [524, "PEE other side ofthe Tweed, is a Hill called Cademuir, anciently Cadhmore, sig nifying in Gaelic, \" the great fight ;\" on the summit of which are four British camps, one of them much stronger than the rest, surrounded with stone walls without cement, in some places double, and where single, no less than sive yards in thickness ; without which, and out of the ruins thereof, have been erected nearly two hundred monumental stones, many of them still standing, and others fallen down, \u2014 being indications, that in very early times, when the Gaelic was the common language of the country, and when the Romans had as yet been the only invaders of it, a great battle had been fought upon that hill, and that, at the strong camp upon its summit, numbers had been killed, and were there interred. On the extremity ofthe Parish, towards the North-West, is a high Hill called Melden, properly Meltein, \" the Hill of Fire,\" from the fires kindled on the top of it, anciently in worship of the Sun, or afterward to give signal to the surrounding country, when enemies appeared in the Firth of Forth ; and round its summit, a large inclosure or camp, is still visible. To wards the East part of the Parish, is a Hill calleJ Frineti, or properly Daneti or Danes' Brae, with two circular Camps ; the highest of which has been sur rounded with a ditch above ten feet in depth. Many other camps are to be seen on eminences and on the tops of hills, all over the country. In later ages, when the ancient smaller Kingdoms in the Island were formed, into the two larger ones of Scotland and England, as the Cheviot Hills were a natural bar rier between them in the middle ofthe country, invasion and war were made by the mouth ofthe Tweed on the East, and of the Solway on the West ; yet small parties often penetrated for plunder into the interior parts. The preda tory disposition, but too much exemplified by the Nations, was practised all over the Country, and particularly towards the Borders, where troops of freebooters made incursions into this part of the country every summer, for carrying off, under cover of the night, Horses, Black Cattle, and Sheep. In defence against these various depredations, strong Castles were built by the Kings of Scotland, on the lower parts ofthe Tweed, and were continued by the Landholders along the higher parts of it, and on the waters which fall into it on each side. They were built of stone and lime prepared in the best manner, and where larger, or situate near the castra of former times, they were called Castles, or when smaller, were called Towers. They were, by general consent, built alternately on both sides the river, and in a continued view of each other. Afire kindled on the top of these Towers, was the known signal of an incursion ofthe enemy :"], [525, "PEE the smoke gave the signal by day, and the flame in the night ; and over a tract of country of 70 miles long, from Berwick to The Bield, and 50 miles broad, intelligence was, in this manner, conveyed in a very few hours. As these build ings are not only antiquities, but evidences ofthe ancient situation ofthe country, and are now most of them in ruins, it may not be improper to mention those along the Tweed for ten miles below Peebles, and as many above it. Thus, Elibank Tower looks to one at Holloiv-lee, this to one at Scrogbank, this to one at Caberrton, this to one at Bold, this to one at Purvis Hill, this to these at Inver-Leithen, Traquair, and Griestone, this last to one at Ormistone, this to one at Cardrona, this to one at Nether Horseburgh, this to Horseburgh Castle, this to these at Haystone, Castle-hill of Peebles and Nidpath, this last to one at Caverhill, this to one at Barns, and to another at Lyne, this to these at Easter Happreiv, Easter Datvic, Hill-House and Wester Dawic now New Posso, this last to one at Dreva, and this to one at Tinnis or Thanes Castle near Drummel zier. Of these, the Castle of Nidpath, not far from the old town of Peebles, and in the line of its principal streeet, is the strongest and in the best preservation : its walls are eleven feet in thickness, and cemented with lime almost as hard as the strong whin-stone of which they are built. It was anciently the property and chief residence ofthe powerful family ofthe Frasers, first proprietors of Oliver Castle, and afterwards ofa great part ofthe lands from thence to Peebles, and Sheriffs ofthe county; and from whom spring the families of Lovat, and Sal toun, in the North. The last of that family, in the male line, in Tweeddale, was the brave Sir Simon Fraser, who, in 1303, along with Sir John Cummin, with only 10,000 men, repulsed and defeated 30,000 English, in three battles fought on one day, upon Roslin Moor. He left two daughters, co-heiresses to his great estate ; one of whom was married to the ancestor of The Marquis of Tweeddale, and the other to the ancestor of The Earl of Wigtoun ; which Families, therefore, quartered the arms ofthe Frasers with their own. And the Castle and large Barony of Nidpath, continuing the property ofthe Tweed dale Family, and the Town of Peebles being much under its Patronage, the Frasers arms are to be seen on the Cross to this day. When King Charles the Second marched for England, John, second Earl of Tweeddale, gar risoned his Castle of Nidpath, for His Majesty's service ; and it held out against Oliver Cromwell, longer than any place South of the Forth. The banks hereabout, particularly from the High road, a little above the Castle, afford a most beautiful prospect, terminated by a view of the Town, and Bridge of"], [526, "PEE Peebles. This Castle was for some time the residence of the Earls of March : it is now, however, in ruins; and belongs at present to The Marquis of Queens berry. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. PEEBLES, SHIRE, or TWEED-DALE. This Shire contains about 150, 528 Scotch acres ; of which, about 15,000 are arable, and the remainder are in pasture, wood, and water. Although from a distant view, this Shire may appear to be one continued chain of hills, yet when internally investigated, there is found along the sides of its principal rivers, many rich and fertile Straths of arable land, which, when well cultivated, produce almost every kind of grain in abundance. It is watered by a number of small streams and rivers, especially the Tweed, which is the fourth great river in Scotland, and which for several miles serves as a boundary between the two United Kingdoms: it derives its source from a well of the same name, among the hills of Tweeds-Muir, in the Western extremity of the Shire, and meandering through its centre, a beautiful serpentine course of 36 miles, divides it nearly into two equal parts. On the banks of this river are many beautiful and romantic country seats, embosomed in plantations of various kinds of trees. Being near the Southern borders ofthe Kingdom, and exposed to the frequent incursions of the English, there is perhaps no river in Scotland, upon the banks of which there have been erected so many places for private defence against their hostile depredations. The sheep bred upon the banks of the Meggot Water are reckoned among the heaviest, and are the hardiest in Tweed-Dale. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 8735, and, in 1811, was 9935. It sends one Member to Parliament. Tweeddale gives the title of Marquis, and Earl, to the Ancient and Illustrious family of Hay, Earl Gifford, Viscount Walden, Lord Yester, and Hereditary Chamberlain of Dunfermlin. William Hay was one of the Peers, who joined with great zeal in the Reformation in the reign of Queen Mary. PEEL, v. CASTLE-TOWN. PEEL, anciently HOLM TOWN, in The Tsle of Man ; and in the Parish of St. Germain : The Church is dedicated to St. Peter. The Resident Popula tion of this Town, in 1792, was 880. It is 12 m. W. from Douglas. Provisions are cheap; and the Bay is spacious, and abounds with a variety offish, particu larly with the red cod, which is an exquisite delicacy. Its commerce is decayed. The Castle stands on a small rocky Island, about an hundred yards North from the Town: the Channel which divides it from the Main-land, being very deep at high water; but, when the tide is out, it is scarcely mid-leg deep. The walls inclose"], [527, "PEN an irregular polygon, whose area contains about two acres : they are flanked with towers, which are remarkably rough ; and are said to have been constructed by Thomas Earl of Derby, about the year 1500. Here are the remains of two Churches ; one of them being dedicated to St. Patrick; and the other, called St. Germain's, or The Cathedral, built about the year 1245, and dedicated to the first Bishop of the Isle : it is now extremely ruinous : it was the Episcopal Cemetery ; and the inhabitants still bury within, and about its walls: beneath it Eastern part, is the Ecclesiastical Prison. It was in this Castle that Eleanor, wife to Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, Lord Protector, was confined, on a charge of witchcraft; but probably for her turbulent spirit, which, according to tradition, makes her still haunt the place. About three miles to the Eastward of Peel, is The Tinwald Mount, an artificial Hill, of singular appearance, and unknown antiquity. The vestiges of two gates, and of a wall which encircled it, are now scarcely visible ; but the rest of this important Mount is entire. The approach to the summit is up a spacious flight of grassy steps, fronting the ancient Chapel of St. John. Below the summit, there are three circular seats raised for the different orders of the people. The lowest is about four feet in width, and eighty yards in circumference. In the circuit and width of the two higher, there is a proportionable diminution; and each seat is regularly advanced three feet above the other ; while the summit, upon which was anciently placed the Chr.ir of State, does not exceed two yards in diameter. Here Sir John Stanley, King and Lord of Man, in 1417, convened the whole body ofthe people, to witness the first promulgation of the laws; which, until that \u00e6ra, had been locked up in the breasts of their venerable Deemsters. The Tinwald Hill is, in some degree, still the scene of legislation ; for all laws, respecting the internal Polity ofthe Island, are never constitutionally binding, till, according to imme morial usage, they are promulgated at this place: from which custom, the Legislature, framing such Acts, are denominated a Tinwald Court: and the Laws of the Island are designated, Acts of Tinwald. At a little distance, is the Chapel of St. John the Baptist, which was re-built about the year 1800; but it is destitute of pews, and is used only on the day of the promulgation of the Laws. Mr. Grose has preserved two Views of The Tinwald Hill. PEFFER, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of White-Kirk. It is 4s* m. S. E. from North Berwick. It is situate on the North bank of Peffer Burn, which here discharges itself into the German Ocean. PENCAITLAND, properly PEN-CAETH-LAN, in the Shire of Hading-"], [528, "PEN ton : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3179., includ ing a glebe of 5 acres, of excellent soil : Patron, Hamilton, of Pencaitland : The Church is in good repair, and is fitted up in a decent manner. It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting of the Villages of Easter and Wester Pencaitland, Winton, and Nisbet) was 925, and, in 1811, was 970. It is 3| m. SE. b. S. from Tranent. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth : the soil is in general wet, and clayey, and indifferently cultivated : about 346 acres are covered with Forest trees, some of which are of great size. It is watered by the Tyne, a muddy slow running river, which flows through its whole extent, dividing it into two equal parts : the small rivulet of Kinchey separates it from the Parish of Ormiston. Coals, and lime-stone, every where abound; and there is plenty of excellent free-stone. There are several springs of Mineral water, which are highly esteemed by the common people, in scorbutic disorders. The Roads are bad. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, besides School-fees. The principal Mansions arc, Fountain- Hall, the Seat of Sir Andrew Lauder Dick, Bart.: \u2014 Pencaitland, of John Hamilton, Esq. ; \u2014 and Winton- House, formerly the residence of The Countess of Winton, previous to the attainder of that Family, in 1715 ; this house is entirely out of repair, though the gardens, which are very spacious, are kept in tolerable order, by The York Buildings Company, who purchased the Forfeited estates, hav ing let them to a gardener. This Parish is supposed to take its name from its situation ; the Church, and Mansion-House of Pencaitland, standing on the edge ofa narrow flat or meadow, on the Northern bank of the Tyne: and, the village of West Pencaitland being situate on the edge of a high bank, on the South side of the same river. Aster the Reformation, the lands of Paystoun, comprehending the Hamlets of East Paystoun, West Paystoun, Paystoun Bank, and Paystoun Mill, were disjoined from the Parish of Pencaitland, and annexed to Ormiston, which adjoins it, on the West. In 1681, the lands of Winton were taken from the Parish of Pencaitland, and given to the Parish of Tranent: but, after the forfeiture ofthe Earl's descendant, in 1715, Winton was ao-ain an nexed to the Parish of Pencaitland, to which it naturally belongs. PENELHEUGH, v. CRAILING. PENNERSAUGHS, in the Shire of Dumfries : an ancient Parish, now com prehended in the Parish of Middlebie. It is situate on the Eastern bank ofthe river Mein, at the distance of a mile South-East from Eccles-Fechan."], [529, "PEN PENNINGHAM, in the District of Machers, and Shire of Wigtown : for- merly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 1240 merks Scotch, in- cluding the allowance for Communion elements ; and \u00a38..14..0. is also allowed by the Heritors yearly, in lieu of a manse : the glebe is very indifferent, and not ofthe legal extent: Patron, The Earl of Galloway: The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Wigtown, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of New- ton Stewart) was 2569, and, in 1811, was 2847. It is 2| m. S. from Newton Stewart. This Parish is 16 miles in length, and from 5 to 6^ miles in breadth, being intersected by the Military Road from Dumfries to Port Patrick : the greater part is wild and uncultivated, but the whole is capable of being rendered exceedingly fertile by the improved system of husbandry. Tlie' Moss of Cree, extending about 4 miles in length, and about the same distance in breadth, along the Western side ofthe Water of Cree, from the Port of Carty, appears to have been formerly covered with the sea, and afterwards with wood ; it is of a deep clay bottom, and is uncommonly fertile. The wool of this Parish is in general good, and superior to that of most ofthe neighbouring Districts. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together w;th Schools-fees, and perquisites ; the whole amounting to about \u00a330. per annum. The climate is healthy. The river Cree, by the assistance ofthe tides from the Bay of Wigtown, is navigable to the Port of Carty, within two miles of Newton Stew-art and Minniegaff ; whi ther small vessels can be navigated with safety, either with merchant goods from the English side, or with lime, coals, and shells. PENPONT, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150..0. .0. : the manse is in good repair: the glebe con sists of 9 acres : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The Church was rebuilt in 1782, and is pleasantly situate upon an eminence on the Scarr. It is in the Presbytery of Penpont, of which it is the Seat, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 966, and, in 1811, was 987. It is 2\\ Tn. S. W. from Thornhill. This Parish is 21 miles in length, and about 5 miles in breadth : the whole district is mountainous, the most remarkable ele vation being that of Cairn- Kinnow; in the North East ridge, is Glenquhargen Craig, which rises almost perpendicularly to the height of 1000 feet. The hills are mostly covered with excellent pasture, and are interspersed with many fertile arable vallies, of which the soil is light, early, and has of late been much improved. It is watered by the Scarr, over which there is a very ancient Bridge of one vol. ii. 3 U"], [530, "PEN semicircular arch, supported by two steep rocks. Free-stone, and whin-stone, are abundant. Dow Loch, a small Lake on the summit ofa hill, was famous in the ao-e of superstition, for curing all kinds of diseases. Coals are brought from Sanquhar, at the distance of 14 miles. The Roads, and Bridges, are in toler able repair. There are the vestiges of a Roman Causeway along the banks of the Scarr: and near the union of the Scarr and the Nith, are the remains ofa large building, called Tibbers Castle, which is said to have been a Roman Station : this castle was taken by surprise from the English by Sir William Wallace ; and from hence the Barony of Tibber derives its name. General Roy has preserved a plan of it, pi. 49. PENSHIEL, v. WHITTINGHAM. PEN-TI-ACHOB, v. EDLESTOWN. PENTLAND, in the Shire of Edinburgh : an ancient Rectory, which was valued at \u00a35.. 6.. 8. : The Church stood at the village of Pentland, in the North- East part ofthe Parish, where its ruins may still be seen. Some time aster the Reformation, the Parish of Pentland was suppressed ; and the Northern part was annexed to Laswade : and, in 1616, the Southern portion, comprehending the Barony of Fulford, was united to the new formed Parish of St. Catherine's, which was, afterward, popularly called Glencross. About half a mile South- West from the Church, stood the Mansion, which is now known by the familiar appellation of Pentland Mains. When The Earl of Orkney founded the Colle giate Church of Roslin, m 1446, he granted to it the Church-lands of Pentland. It is 5 m. S. from Edinburgh. PENTLAND FIRTH, is that Strait, which separates the Mainland of Scot land from The Orkney Isles. It is 24 miles in length, and varies from 4 to 5 leagues in breadth ; and forms a communication between the German and the Atlantic Oceans. In the mouth of the Firth, towards the East, and nearly half way between Duncan's-Bay Head and the Orkneys, are situate the Pentland Skerries; two small uninhabited Islands, upon one of which a Light-House is erected. The parts ofthe Firth, most dangerous to navigation, are two currents, stretching from Duncan's-Bay Head and St. John's Head, to a considerable dis tance from the land ; the former is called The Boars of Duncan's Bay, and the latter The Main of Mey ; where the billows are often elevated to a tremendous height, even in the finest summer day. They seem to arise from the collision of tides in opposite directions, and recoiling with increased impetuosity from the Head-lands above mentioned: Without the aid of skilful pilotage, they are"], [531, "PEN dangerous even in the calmest weather. The tides in every part of the Firth are various and irregular, and of course the navigation is difficult ; especially in the night, when a very small deviation from the proper course may be attended with fatal consequences. PENTLAND HILLS, a range of Hills, which, beginning near the Firth of Forth on the East, run Westward, and end at the Borders of Clydesdale. Some of these hills are of considerable elevation, and in general afford excellent pas ture to numerous flocks of sheep. See, Lowlands. PENTLAND SKERRY, one ofthe Orkneys ; and constituting part of the South Parish of South Ronaldsay. This Isle is about a mile long, and half a mile broad, and is appropriated to the pasturage of-sheep, and cattle. It is about 6 miles South from South Ronaldsay, near the middle ofthe East entrance ofthe Pentland Firth. A Light-House has lately been erected here, which is of great advantage to shipping. Near this Skerry, there are two or three other Skerries or rocks, which are perfectly barren. PENYCUICK, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Rectory, compre hending the ancient Parish of Mount-Lothian ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a369..16..10-f. Sterling, \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and \u00a380..3..1-\u00a7*. by Parliamentary augmentation : with a manse, and a glebe : Patron, Sir John Clerk, Bart. : The Church, which was built in 1771, is a handsome edifice, with a Portico, supported by four Doric pillars : the old Church was dedicated to St. Kentigern, popularly called St. Mungo; it retained the name of St. Kentigern, as late as 1733 ; and there is near it, a spring, which was called St. Mungo's Well, and which is now inclosed in the Minister's garden. It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1705, and, in 1811, was 1827. It is 9 m. S. from Edinburgh. A Penny-Post Office is established here. This Parish compre hends the greatest part ofthe ancient Parish of Penycuick, and the whole ofthe old Parish of Mount-Lothian. It extends from 1 1 to 12 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth ; and is watered by the river North Esk, which, rising in its Western extremity, runs through its whole extent: towards the Northern border, it includes a considerable part of the Pentland Hills, upon which are constantly fed great flocks of sheep, about 8000 being reared in this Parish : the Southern parts are more level ; and the surface is exceedingly various, exhibiting every kind of soil, from clay and moss to the poorest gravelly loam. The roads are good. The fuel is coal and peat, of both which there is plenty in the Parish,, but 3U2"], [532, "PEN the coal is not worked at present. Near the village is Penycuick- House, an elegant Mansion, erected, in 1761, by the late Sir James Clerk, Bart. : its situ ation is delightful, commanding a fine prospect ofthe valley in which the North Esk flows, and terminated by the Western extremity of the Pentlands, and the ruins of Brimstone Castle : the Library contains an excellent collection of Books and Paintings: and the Proprietor has also collected a great number of Roman antiquities, principally from tbe Wall of Antoninus, and the Roman Camp at Netherby ; the surrounding policies are highly ornamental, and near the river is Ossian's Hall, the much admired work of Runciman : at the back of the house is an exact model ofthe celebrated Roman Temple, which formerly stood on the banks ofthe Carron, and which Buchannan termed Templum Termini, but is better known by the name of Arthur's Oon : on the opposite side of the river, to the South, is an Obelisk, which is raised to the memory of Allan Ramsay, the celebrated Poet, who frequently resided here, and is supposed to have laid the scene of his beautiful Pastoral, \" The Gentle Shepherd,\" on the borders of this Parish, and Glencross. New Hall, about three miles above Penycuick, on the North side ofthe North Esk, was, in 1529, and during the rest of that Century, in the possession of a family of the name of Crichtoune. How long it was a place of consequence, and inhabited by them, before that period, is uncertain : but the Castle of Brimstone , the ruins of which still remain, about two miles down the river, and on the same side, was also occupied by a family of that name, in 1568 ; at which time, as appears by this date on the Avail, a part of it at least seems to have been built. Whe ther, prior to the date of the earliest writing, it had received the name of New Hall, in contradistinction to an Old building that had formerly existed, is not known; but that this was the case is probable, from its having been the opinion of one of its proprietors that it was once a Religious House ; and also from the name of New House having been given to a building in somewhat similar cir cumstances, close by it, on the lands of Spittal. New Hall passed from the Families of Crichtoune, Penycuick, and Oliphant, into that of Forbes, in 1703, to whom it now belongs. The Spittal was probably an Hospitium or Inn, and the road, with its Crosses, which also served as land-marks, ran accom modation for travellers passing from one Monastery to another ; the Back Spittal suiting such as went by the North side ofthe hills. In confirmation of this, the weary and benighted traveller is still considered as having a right to shelter and protection at the Old Spittal ; and one of the Out-houses, with some straw, is"], [533, "PER generally allotted for that purpose. It is also remarkable, that there is still an Inn upon these lands, though indeed on a different foundation, making the first stage on the great Roads from Edinburgh to Moffat, and Dumfries and Biggar, along the foot ofthe Pentland Hills : and farther, it is called the New House, though now a very old one, seemingly to distinguish it from the Spittals, in the place of which it had been built. These Lands, till lately, held of Herriots Hos pital, in Edinburgh : the last Proprietor who resided at Spittal, where there is still a comfortable slated house, and some fine old ash trees, was a gentleman ofthe name of Oswald, who was accidentally shot by his servant who was walk ing behind with his gun, in going to Slipperfield-Loch, in the Parish of Linton, to shoot wild ducks ; he lies in that Church -yard, with a Latin Epitaph ; and aster his death, the property was acquired by Mr. Forbes. In the bed of the Esk, are often found beautiful pebbles and bloodstones, which are esteemed by lapi daries. The remains of several encampments, both circular and rectangular, are still visible in this neighbourhood. Ravens-Nook Castle, which is situate on the Esk, was the property of the Sinclairs, of Roslin. Two Paper Manu factories here have lately been converted by Government into depots, for the custody of French Prisoners. PERCIE-TOWN, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Dreghorn. It is 2| m. E. N. E. from Irvine. PERSY, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Bendothy. This is a detached Estate, situate on the river Shee : it is divided into North and South Persy, and belongs to two Proprietors, who have inclosed the greatest part of it. It formerly constituted part ofthe possessions ofthe Monks of Cupar of Angus. A Chapel of Ease was built a few years ago at North Persy, for the accommo dation of the Inhabitants in the neighbourhood ; but not being endowed, the seat-rents and collections, which amount to about \u00a330., are the only Salary of the Preacher, This Chapel is 9 miles distant from the Parish Church. PERT, in the Shire of Forfar : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Loo-ie : The Church is situate on the Banks of the North Esk, very near the Old North Water Bridge. The whole of the Parish of Pert is under thirlage to the meal mill there ; some of the tenants 'paying \u25a0?'-, and others T'T peck of multure, besides knaveship, &c. PERTH, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Perth : The Parish Church, which formerly belonged to the Abbey"], [534, "PER of Dunfermlin, and was dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is a large and ancient Building, now divided into what are called The East, Middle, and WestChurches : the Rectory Tythes usually paid, are divided between two Ministers : each of whom has yearly from the Heritors, 80 bolls of oat-meal, and 70 bolls of barley, and \u00a33..14..5| of Vicarage Tythes ; besides which, The Town Council pay to each of them annually, out ofthe Seat Rents, \u00a321..5..6y, and have lately added, during their pleasure, \u00a320. more : The Town Council pay yearly to the Ordained Assistant \u00a3100. ; and, during their pleasure, to the Asssistant ofthe Senior Minister, \u00a350. per annum.

The Markets are well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Friday in March, the first Friday in April, the 15th of June, the 5th and third Tuesday, O, S., in July, the 9th of September, the 20th of October, the llth of December, and on Friday before Christmas day. A General Post-Office is established here. The City of Perth is of great anti quity, and is supposed to have been in existence at the time when the Romans extended their arms to the banks of the Tay : and it would appear from the Itinerary of Richard of Cirencester, that there were three Roman Towns in this Neighbourhood, called Alauna, Lindum, and Victoria; the last of which was built by Agricola, on the river Tay, 28 miles from the exit of that river into the German Ocean. The Picts, after their conversion to Christianity, consecrated the Church, which they had built here, to St. John the Baptist, whom they chose as the Tutelar Saint of the place, and which, from this cir cumstance, received the name of St. John's Toum. It is situate in the middle of a verdant plain, which it divides into two parts, called The North and Smith Inches ; each of which is about a mile and a half in circumference. About the year 1210, it was strongly fortified, and was reckoned the Capital City of the Scottish Kingdom, and now ranks next in pre-eminence to Edinburgh, and"], [535, "PER GI asgow. Prior to the reign of the Stewart family it was the usual residence ofthe Scottish Monarchs ; and the Parliament House, and many ofthe Houses of the Nobility, still remain, though altered according to modern convenience. In early times, it was a place of great trade : an extensive commerce was long carried on between Perth and the Netherlands ; and many German merchants or Flemings, after trading with Perth for a length of time, seem to have settled there. It was considerably benefited also by the Civil Wars ; for a great num- ber of Cromwell's officers and soldiers settled in it, and taught the Citizens of Perth to improve their modes of life by the English arts, and excited among them a spirit of industry. But, the great improvement of the Town is to be dated from the year 1745, it being supposed to have increased nearly one-half since that turbulent period ; as the government of this part of Great Britain had never been properly settled, till a little after that time. The Castle, which stood near the Skinner-Gate Street, rendered it a place of Military importance, and made it frequently experience the calamities of war. In its Municipal capacity, Perth is now a Royal Borough, and joins with Dundee, Forfar, Cupar of Fife, and St. Andrew's, in sending one Member to Parliament. It is governed by a Provost, who exercises the office of Sheriff and Coroner within the Royalty, three Baillies, a Dean of Guild, Treasurer, and Town Council, the greater part of whom are elected from the Incorporated Trades. The funds of the City are very con- siderable, and have been expended with great judgment in making the various improvements. The Tay, which is navigable up to the Quays for vessels of 120 tons burden, admits of great extension of commerce. The staple manufacture of Perth is linen : but there are also considerable manufactures of cotton good, leather, boots, shoes, and gloves ; and the Printing business has been carried on to a vast extent by the patriotic firm of Morison. A respectable Bank- ing Company, under the title of The Perth Bank, has been established for many years ; and there is also a branch of The Bank of Scotland. This is the County Town, the Seat ofthe Presbytery, and where the Circuit Court of Justiciary, for the Northern Circuit, is holden twice a year. The Gram- mar School has long been esteemed one of the best in Scotland, and has produced many eminent Statesmen, and Scholars ; among whom must be mentioned The Admirable Crichton, and the late celebrated and excellent William Earl of Mansfield. There is also an Academy, in a deservedly flou- rishing state, where every branch of Natural Philosophy, Drawing, French, and the Italian language, are taught by the most able Masters. On the 16th of"], [536, "PER December 1784, A Literary and Antiquarian Society was established here, who have a considerable collection of Books and subjects of Antiquity, suitable to the design of their Institution. The manners ofthe Inhabitants are gay ; and politeness, good sense, and moral rectitude, are their distinguishing features. By a Decreet in 1602, they enjoy some particular Privileges ; one of which is, that they are the only persons, who, in the course of trade, are exempted from paying what is called \" The Shore Silver at Dundee A In 1798, a New Town was begun to be built upon feus from Mr. Anderson, on the ground where once stood the Monastery of Black Friars, in which James the first was murdered by The Earl of Athol and his accomplices : and already contains a Circus, and a Terrace, of elegant houses. The magnificent Bridge over the Tay, which was executed from a design ofthe late Mr. Smeaton, and which opens a communi- cation with the various great roads that centre here, was completed in 1771, at the expense of \u00a326,000. Sterling. Besides the Tay, the City is supplied by a part of the water of the Almond, which is conducted by an ancient Canal to the Mills ; it also affords water for culinary purposes, and formerly filled the ditches, when the Town was fortified. A little to the North-West of the New Town, large and convenient Cavalry Barracks were lately erected, where generally half a regiment of Horse are stationed. \" It is to no purpose,\" says Mr. Pennant, \" to search for any remains of the Monastic antiquities of this Place : fanatic fury having in a few hours prostrated the magnificent works of mistaken Piety.\" It was at Perth, that The Reformed Religion was first publicly avowed. Mr. John Knox, attended by many of the chief Nobility ofthe Kingdom, preached a Sermon in the Parish Church here, against Idolatry, on Thursday the llth of May 1559 : After the Sermon, one ofthe Priests having given a trifling provo- cation, a number of the people broke down all the Altars and Images, in the Parish Church, and then proceeded to the entire demolition ofthe Monasteries : Ever since that remarkable \u00e6ra, a weekly Sermon has been preached at Perth, on the Thursday forenoon. On the South-East side ofthe City, stands Gowrie Castle, formerly the residence of The Earls of Gowrie, until forfeited by that Noble family, on account of that strange and mysterious transaction, called Goicrie's Conspiracy, the scene of which was this House : and certain it is, that the Attainder of this family caused very considerable Escheats to the Crown, and afforded the means of gratifying a number of ' ' rapacious Courtiers.\" After Lord Gowrie's forfeiture, the Magistrates obtained the property of this Castle, which, in the year 1746, they presented, together with the freedom of the Town,"], [537, "PET to His Royal Highness William Duke of Cumberland, from whom the Board of Ordnance, as report says, purchasedit for \u00a35000.: and it has ever since served as Barracks, for the detachment of the Royal Artillery in Scotland. In the garden of Gowrie House, in a walk near the river Tay, stands The Monks' Tower : but neither the origin of its name, nor its use, are correctly ascertained. Mr. Grose has preserved views both of this Castle, and Tower. \u2014 The Parish of Perth is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The soil is partly loam, and partly clay : and is exceedingly fertile, and well cultivated. The sur rounding scenery is truly delightful ; but, most of the estates in the neighbour hood being entailed, there are few Gentlemens' Seats : the most remarkable houses are, The Castle of Balhousie, an ancient Seat of the Earls of Kinnoul: \u2014 The Castle of Pit-theveless, an ancient Seat of the Lords Oliphant : \u2014 and Feu-House, a Seat belonging to Mr. Marshall, of Hill-Cairney. The principal Villages are Craigie-Mill, Muir-toivn of Balhousie , and Tulloch. The British title of Lord Perth, has lately been revived in an Ancient and Loyal branch of the family of Drummond. , PERTH, SHIRE. This is one ofthe largest Shires in Scotland; extending 77 miles in length, and 68 miles in breadth, and containing 4,068,640 English acres. On the North and West, it is covered by heathy mountains, part of the Grampians, which are intersected with numerous vallies full of natural wood; and it is principally adapted for pasture, and the rearing of sheep and cattle. On the South and East, the soil is of a stronger quality ; and, when properly cultivated, is abundantly fertile : through this part ofthe County, there runs a remarkable range of green hills, from South-West to North-East, called The Ochils, which have long been famous for their large and hardy breed of sheep. Strathearn is that great valley, through which the fine river that gives its name to the District, flows almost in a straight line for about 40 miles : its fertile banks are adorned with Noblemen and Gentlemens' Seats, surrounded with flourishing plantations-; and enjoy prospects equally grand, extensive, and beautiful. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 126,366, and, in 1811, was 135,093. It sends one Member to Parliament. PETCOKS, v. STENTON.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Aberdeen. The Resident Popula- tion of this Parish, in 1801, was 871, and, in 1811, was 1032. It is 7 m. S.W. from Aberdeen. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and from 5 to 6 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern bank ofthe river Dee. The surface is rugged and uneven ; the arable soil varies from a light loam to clay, with a mix- ture of peat-moss, and is in general tolerably fertile : but the far greater part is appropriated to the pasturage of black cattle, and sheep. Here is a consi- derable extent of wood, both natural and planted. The principal manufacture is that of paper, which is conducted with great success. The climate is particu- larly healthy. Partridges are very numerous. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a rood of land, and \u00a31..14..2. from a fund left by two of the late proprietors of Culter, Sir Alexander Cuming, and Patrick Duff, Esq., for teaching particular Scholars.

It is in the Presbytery of Deer, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including The Kirk-Town, Ronheads, Keith Inch or Quenzie, and the Town of Peterhead, properly so called ; and the Village of Boddom) was 4491, and, in 1811, was 5070. It is 154 m. N. N. E. from Edinburgh. The weekly Market on Friday is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the third Tuesday, O. S., in May, and the second Tuesday, O. S., in November. A General Post- Office is established here. The Town is built upon a Peninsula, which projects into the German Ocean, and forms the most Easterly point of land in Scotland : the Isthmus, which connects it with the country, being only about 800 yards broad. The Town, together with the adjacent lands, of considerable value and extent, formerly belonged to the Abbey of Deer. In 1587, the Abbacy was"], [539, "PET erected inlo a Temporal Lordship in favour of Robert Keith, then Commenda tor of Deer, by the title of Lord Altree ; which Peerage becoming extinct, the Superiority of the Town fell to The Earl Marischal ; who, in 1593, erected it into a Burgh of Barony, under the name of Keith Inch, and granted feus of ground for building. After the forfeiture of The Earl Marischal in 1715, the Town and Lands adjacent were bought by a Fishing Company in England ; which failing in 1726, \\he property was purchased by the Governors of the Merchant Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh, of whom the Town at present holds as Superiors. The government is vested in a Baillie, and 8 Counsellors : the Baillie is named by the Superiors, and has his Commission from them : the Counsellors are chosen annually by the Feuars, at a general meeting called for that purpose ; four of whom are chosen from among the merchants, two from the Ship-masters, and two from the trades. The Revenue of the Burgh, which is pretty considerable, is annually expended in the improvement ofthe place. It is a commodious, and well pui\\\\. Town, and is much frequented in Summer for its opportunities of Sea-bathing ; and the Mineral Well, called The Wine Well, from the water sparkling in the glass, like Champagne, which has been long and justly celebrated. Dr. Laing, who has published an analysis of its water, recommends it strongly in cases of general debility, disorders of the stomach and bowels, nervous affections, and female complaints. Great exertions have been made to accommodate the company who resort hither for their health ; and, during the season, there are Assemblies every fortnight. Upon the Keith Inch, there are many elegant Houses ; and, on the South side, is an old Castle, built in the beginning of the Seventeenth century, by George Earl Marischal, which is now used as a granary and store-house. Near it is a small Fort, and a Guard- House, with a battery of four 12, and four 18 pounders, erected during the late American war, after the attempts of Fall, the Pirate, upon several Sea ports on the Eastern coast. It has long been a place of considerable trade; and has two Harbours, the North and the South; the North Harbour, which is the oldest, has a pier of very large rough stones, and is chiefly used for laying up vessels for the winter, and for receiving the large fishing boats from the Moray Firth, and the fishing and Pilot boats of Peterhead : there is eleven feet depth of water at stream tides in this harbour, but the channel is narrow. Here are extensive manufactures of thread, woollen cloth, and cotton, and a large salt work. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is ably conducted, is 13 bolls and 3 firlots of meal from the Country part of the Parish, \u00a310. from the Town of 3X2"], [540, "PET Peterhead, and \u00a35- from the Merchants' box, together with School-fees, and perquisites: besides which, there is a School for writing and arithmetic, settled by Dr. Anderson's Trustees, with a Salary of \u00a320. Sterling. \u2014 The Parish of Peterhead, anciently called Peter Ugie, extends around the Town to the South of the river Ugie, and comprehends about 7000 acres ; of which, 5000 are arable, and 2000 are muir and moss. The sea coast extends about four miles, and comprises the two Bays of Peterhead, and Invernetlie; and the three Promontories of Satie's Head, Boddom Head, and Keith Inch; the latter of which is unquestionably the Easternmost point of land in Scotland, and ought to be termed Buchan-Ness, though that name is more generally given to Boddom Head. The surface is in general flat ; and the soil varies from a sandy loam to a rich black earth or strong clay, producing excellent crops. The air is rather moist, and foggy. Fish of various kinds, and of an excellent quality, are in great plenty. Old Craig, or Raven's Craig Castle, now in ruins, was formerly, and for a long time, the seat of a branch of The Marischal Family. Here are inexhaustible Quarries of excellent granite. The roads are indifferent. The peat mosses are nearly exhausted ; but coals are procured at a moderate rate. Every species of Servitude is abolished, except thirlage to the mills, which is universally considered as a heavy burden, and a great obstacle to improvement. Sir Walter Farquhar, Bart., so well known for his Medical practice in the higher circles ofthe Kingdom, is a Native of this Parish. The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges in their Fourth Report observe, \" on the Coast of Aberdeenshire, about 15 miles South of Frazerburgh, the flourishing Town of Peterhead lies in the bottom ofa small Bay ofthe same name, exposed towards the South-East. The Harbour is in great want of improvement even for its present purposes, and a scheme was furnished by Mr. Rennie in 1806, embracing ulterior views to a great extent, but confined for the present to an expenditure of \u00a37,800. The Committee on the Forfeited Estate Funds recom mended \u00a34200. to be allotted towards this purpose, and an application for that sum was made accordingly in September 1806. The intended improvement consists in extending the Jetty Head of the West Pier twenty yards further out, and in deepening the Harbour four feet and a half by excavating 30,000 cubic yards of rocky ground. An Act authorizing Tolls for the improvement of Peterhead Harbour was obtained in 1807, and from that source the Inhabitants intended to raise money sufficient to meet the sum expected from the Public ; but upon information that this could not be permitted, they without hesitation"], [541, "PET agreed to raise a Moiety of \u00a37,800. among themselves, We paying the other Moiety ; and further, that if we would allow the full sum of \u00a34200. mentioned in the Report of 1806, they would extend their Subscription in proportion, and excavate the Harbour to a greater depth. This latter proposal we have declined, until we shall be convinced, in the progress of the excavation, that such an increase of expenditure would produce an adequate benefit. By a certificate from Mr. Rennie, We find that the proposed extension ofthe Jetty ofthe West Pier has been executed according to his Plan, and with considerable effect (as we learn from Peterhead) in quieting the water within the harbour. The Inhabitants of Peterhead have moreover entered into a Contract and Obligation to complete the intended excavation by the end of the year 181 1, and We under stand that two moveable Cofferdams are prepared for the difficult part of the work, which can only be carried on in'calm weather. The easier portion ofthe work, which consists in removing rocks dry at ordinary low-water, is mostly finished : and there appears to be considerable eagerness in the Inhabitants to improve their Harbour, and consequently to fulfil their Contract as soon as possible. We are assured, that, besides thus raising a Moiety of \u00a37800., they have mortgaged their Tolls for \u00a34500. with a view to further improvement. The entrance of this Harbour is eighteen feet deep at Spring tides , and it is expected that, from the improvement now in operation, the Harbour itself at ordinary tides will accommodate vessels of fourteen to sixteen feet draft of water.\" \u2014 Bya Letter, dated the 8th of April, 1808, from Robert Robertson, Esq , the Chief Magistrate of Peterhead, to The Commissioners, it appears, that \" a situation more favourable than Peterhead for the general advantage of the Coasting Trade can scarcely well be conceived ; if a good Harbour was made there, it would not only be of great advantage to vessels trading to and from it, but to all vessels passing along the East coast of Scotland, as they could in stormy weather, when they cannot with safety keep the sea, find shelter there. If the North Harbour, and Wet Dock (of about three acres), were to be made, there is scarcely a Wind that blows which is dangerous on that coast, but what they could enter it, and having the advantage of a South and North entrance they could sail out of it with almost any wind, that would enable them to proceed on their voyage ; viewing it in this light, Mr. Rennie is of opinion that carrying the whole scheme into execution is an object of great Public Interest. \u2014 The improvements proposed are, 1st. To extend the Jetty-Head ofthe present West Pier about 60 feet nearly"], [542, "PET in the same direction as the present Jetty, and to deepen the present Harbour over the whole of its bottom about 4 feet or 4| feet (except where the slanting Beach is proposed,) the expense of which Mr. Rennie estimates at \u00a37,800. 2dly. To form a communication between the South and North Harbour, and to form a Wet Dock of about three acres, and having 17 feet water at ordinary- Spring tides, the expense of which is estimated at \u00a322,275. 3dly. To protect the Northern Bay or Harbour from the sea, and to form a North Harbour by means of two large Piers, the expense of which Mr. Rennie estimates at \u00a334,860. These improvements are such that they may be carried into execution pro gressively, and each part, so far as it goes, will produce a certain degree of benefit.\"\u2014 In their Fifth Report, dated the 1st of May, 1811, The Commissioners state, \" The Inhabitants of Peterhead engaged to remove 30,000 cubic yards of rocky ground from the bottom ofthe Harbour, by the end of tlie year 1811 ; and their eagerness to prosecute the intended improvement has been such, that they have already called upon us for a final inspection : nor is there any reason to suppose that they have not already fulfilled the contract, ninety men having been employed by them during the last season, and their plans of improvement extending farther than the bare completion of their engagement with Us. We are sorry to learn, that they have not been entirely successful in deepening the Harbour Mouth, which has been attempted by means of moveable Cofferdams ; as these, machines have only enabled them to sink holes in the rock, but not so to clear it away, as to leave a smooth surface at bottom.\" \u2014 Peterhead is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0 27' North, and the Longitude of 1\u00b0 17' West from Greenwich.

S. from Lanark. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the banks ofthe Clyde; where the haughs are very extensive, and being enriched by the^ frequent inundations of the river, are"], [543, "PET exceedingly fertile : the hills are appropriated to pasture. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, exclusive ofthe annual produce ofa mor tification, together with School-fees, a good house, and a small garden. The climate is1 healthy. On the confines ofthe Parish to the South, are the vestiges ofa strong military Station ; in which, urns and other antiquities have been dis covered. The House of Westraw, or Westerhall, has undergone so many alter ations, that it has lost, in a great measure, the appearance of antiquity. The lands of Weslraiv were given to Sir Adam Johnston, of that Ilk, in the time of James the Second, King of Scotland, in reward for his loyalty; and, in particular, for his activity in suppressing the Rebellion of The Earl of Douglas : they were afterwards alienated, and now belong to The Earl of Hyndford. The Public roads are in tolerable repair ; but the cross-roads are bad. Coals are the general fuel, which are brought from Ponfeigh about 7 miles distant. PETTY, in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Rectory, with the Vicarage of Brachla united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 78 bolls of barley, 2 bolls of oat-meal, and \u00a330. Sterling, together with about 10 acres of glebe land, most of it a poor light soil; the manse is in tolerable repair: Patron, The Earl of Moray : The Church, which is situate inconveniently for the Parishioners, is dedicated to St. Coluim. It is in the Presbytery of Inverness, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1585, and, in 1811, was 1615. It is 6| m. N. E. from Inverness. This Parish extends along the South East side of the Moray Firth, about 8 miles in length, and about 4 miles in breadth : the greater part is flat, but rises considerably to the South : the arable soil, which is nearly two-thirds of the Parish, is in general light and sandy, though easily improved. The air is serene ; and the climate is dry, and healthy. The great disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the scarcity of fuel. The Gaelic language continues in general use ; and the Highlaud dress is still in a great measure retained. Personal Services are totally abolished. The land ing places on this part of the Moray Firth (for there are no Harbours) are but indifferent : the water is shallow at and near the shore, and at low water the sea retires to a great distance : but there are two or three places, where safe and commodious Harbours for small Vessels might be made at a trifling expense. Two or three Fishing boats are employed here. The great Military Roads, and Bridges, are in excellent repair. The Salary ofthe Schoolmaster is twelve bolls of Oat-meal, allocated on and paid by the Tenants, together with a School house built in 1784 at about half a mile from the Church, the School-fees which"], [544, "P I E are low, and some small perquisites. On the Estate of The Earl of Moray, is an ancient Seat, called Castle Stuart, which was once designed for the Family mansion ; but it has been for many years out of repair, and uninhabitable : it, however, gives the title of Baron Stuart, of Castle Stuart, to that Illustrious Family, so created on the 4th of June, 1796. In different parts of the Parish are vestiges of Druidical circles; and, near the Church-yard, are two artificial mounds, which are said to have been places for administering Justice ; they are called Tom Mhbit, i. e. Tlie Court Hill. A small part of this Parish belongs to the Shire of Nairn. PETTY-CUR, v. KINGHORN. PHARNUA, v. KIRK-HILL.

Sir James Murray, who had been concerned in treasonable practices, during the turbulent reign of Charles the Second, was, in 1689, made a Lord of Session, by the Title of Philiphaugh : \u2014 In 1707, Mr. John Murray, who was probably ofthe same family, was elevated to the same Seat, by the Title of Lord Bowhill. Near this, is a mineral Spring. Within a mile of Philiphaugh, there once stood on a height, near Broadmeadow , a monumental stone, called Wil liam's Cross : which, it is said, was raised, where one of the Earls of Douglas was killed : This tradition points to the place, where William Douglas, the Knight of Lidsdale, was slain by William Earl of Douglas. Godscroft says, the Knight was hunting in \" Galse Wood,\" when he was killed ; he was carried the first night to Lindean Church, a mile from Selkirk ; and was buried in Melros Abbey. - PHILLAN'S, ST., v.

PITTENWEEM, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : the manse was built in 1720 : Patron, Sir John Anstruther, Bart. : The Church is in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Popu lation of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1072, and, in 1811, was 1096. It is 33| m. NE. b. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. It is situate on the Northern coast ofthe Firth of Forth, and had formerly a considerable trade : but having suffered much in its commerce between the years 1639 and 1645, and the fishery having also decayed, it was greatly de creased : of late, however,' its trade and population have begun to revive. Pit tenweem was erected into a Royal Borough by James the Fifth, in 1547 ; and it is now one of the Contributary Boroughs with Crail, in sending one Member to Parliament. This Parish is about a mile and a quarter in length, and about half a mile in breadth. The surface is flat ; and the soil is a fertile black loam. The air is dry, and healthy: and the water is remarkably soft, while that ofthe neighbouring Parishes is hard and brackish. The roads are good. About 8 tons of kelp are annually made here. The Priory of Pittenweem, now in ruins, was a House of Canons Regular of the Order of St. Augustine, dedicated to The Vir gin Mary, and a Cell to the Mitred Abbey of St. Andrew's. It had large landed endowments, together with the Churches of Rhind, Anstruther Wester, &c, which are now erected into a Regality, called The Regality of Pittenweem, of which the Lairds of Anstruther are Heritable Baillies. In 1567, Colonel Stuart, Captain of His Majesty's Guards, was appointed Commendator of Pittenweem : in 1609, his son, Frederick Stuart, was raised to the dignity of Lord Pitten weem, by the favour of King James the Sixth : but, dying without male issue, the Honour became extinct. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of this Priory. The learned John Douglas, late Lord Bishop of Salisbury, and author ofthe vindication of Milton from the charge of plagiarism against Lauder, was a native of Pittenweem : in 1786, he was nominated one ofthe Vice-Presidents of The Society of Antiquaries of London, and was also one of the Trustees of The British Museum; and, after a life actively devoted to the cause of 3Y2"], [548, "P L A literature and religion, retaining his faculties to the last, he died of a gradual decay, without a struggle, on the 18th of May 1807, aged 86, and was buried in St. George's Chapel, Windsor. PITTENSEIR, v. LLAN BRIDE, PIT-THEVELESS, CASTLE, v. PERTH. PITTILLOCK, v. MARKINCH PITTODRY, v. OYNE. PITVAR, in the Shire of Perth ; in the Parish of Fossawsy. These Lands originally belonged to The Earls of Tullibardine. But a Clan then at variance with the Murrays, having committed some depredations on them, the aggres sors were pursued ; and being found in a Church, feasting on the cattle which they had stolen, the Murrays shut the gates, and setting fire to the Church, consumed every person in it. This action which appeared so cruel, and being committed in the Church, which was reduced to ashes, was highly offensive to the clergy: who represented it in terms so aggravated, that the Murrays were excommunicated by the Pope. Hence, as an atonement, and to make peace with the Church, the Chieftain of the Murrays made over the lands ofPitvar to the Abbots of Culross. These lands now hold of the Crown, as having come in the place of that Abbacy ; and theirs/ Minister of Culross, at present, receives the duties payable out of these lands, as part of his Stipertd. As this was the most Southern part of the Lands belonging to the Murrays, and on the extre mity ofthe County, it is highly probable, that it obtained the original name of Pitvar, by way of distinction ; Pit, signifying a Hollow, and Varar, an old name of Murray: and hence, Vararis \u00c6stuarium was the Latin name for Tlie Moray Firth. Here also is The Monk's Grave. -i PLADA, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part of the Parish of Killbrandon, and is pro ductive of slate. PLADA, ISLE, in the Firth of Clyde, and Shire of Bute. It is situate to the Southward ofthe Isle of Arran, about a mile from thence, and constitutes part ofthe Parish of Kill-Mory. Here a Light-House has lately been erected, with two different lights, to distinguish it in the night from those on the Mulls of Can tyre, Galloway, and Cumbray. It is a low, small Island ; and was probably at some ancient period severed from that of Arran, as the name Bladhan, i. e.s to break, seems to indicate. PLAIDS, in the Shire of Cromarty, though locally situate in the Shire of"], [549, "P L U Ross ; and in the Parish of Tain. It is situate on the Bay of Tain, at the dis tance ofa mile North-East from the Burgh. See, Cromarty. PLATANE, FOREST of, v. KIRRIE-MUIR. PLEABRAE, v. MAXTON.

PLEASANTS, Tlie, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of St. Cuthbert. This is a Suburb of the City of Edinburgh, on the South-East. It formerly belonged to the Earls of Roxburgh, and was purchased from one of them by the Magistrates of Edinburgh, in the year 1636. Here was a Priory of Nuns, dedicated to St. Mary of Placentia: and the Street still bears, corruptly, the Name of The Pleasants: the time, and the founder of this Religious estab lishment, are unknown. PLENDERLEITH, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Oxnam : The Chapel is demolished, but the Cemetery continues still to be used. This is a small Village, situate near the source of the river Oxnam, and at the distance of 9 miles SE. b. S. from Jedburgh. PLUNTON CASTLE, v. BORGUE. PLUSCARDEN, in the Shire of Elgin ; and in the Parish of Elgin. This Priory stands on the North side ofthe river Lossie, about six miles South-West from the Town of Elgin, and near the entrance ofthe Valley, at the foot of the North Hill. It was founded by King Alexander the Second, in the year 1230, and was dedicated to the Honour of St. Andrew, and named Vallis Sancti An drece. It was peopled with Monks of Vallis Caulium, in France, a reform of the Cistertians, following the Rule of St. Bennet. These Monks for some time strictly observed the constitutions of their Order, but at length relaxing in their discipline, and by degrees becoming vicious, the Monastery was reformed,' and from an independent House, was degraded to a Cell of the Abbey of Dunfermlin. By the munificence of divers pious persons, this Monastery became very rich. The whole Valley of Pluscarden, three miles in length ; the lands, and mills, at Old Mills, near the Town of Elgin ; some lands in Durres ; and the lands of Grange Hill, belonged to it ; and at the latter place, the Priory had a Grange and a Cell of Monks. The walls of the Precinct are almost entire, and make nearly a square figure : The Church, which stands about the centre, is a fine edifice, in the form of a Cross, with a square Tower in the middle, all of hewn stone. The"], [550, "POL Oratory and Refectory join to the South end ofthe Church, under which is the Dormitory. The Chapter House is a piece of curious workmanship ; the vaulted roof of which is supported by one Pillar. The lodgings ofthe Prior, and cells of the Monks were all contiguous to the Church. Here are, in different parts, paintings in fresco on the walls. Within the Precincts were excellent gar dens. The Prior was Lord of Regality within the Priory Lands, and had a dis tinct Regality, in Grange Hill, called \" The Regality of Staneforenoon.\" At the Reformation, Sir Alexander Seaton, afterwards Earl of Dunfermlin, was, in 1565, made Commendator of Pluscarden : he disposed ofthe Church lands and the patronage, the lands of Grange Hill, and the Barony of Pluscarden, and Old Mill, on the 23d of February 1595, to Kenneth Mackenzie, of Kintail, who got a new grant of that Barony, dated the 12th of March 1607 : and which after wards passed through the families of Caithness, Bateman, Grant, and Brodie, into that of Duff, and are now the property of The Earl of Fife. It is commonly reported, that the famous Book of Pluscarden, seen and perused by George Buchanan, was written here ; but that Book is supposed by many persons, with great probability, to have been only a copy of Fordun, belonging to this Monastery. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of it. POINT of AYRE, in THE ISLE of MAN, v. KIRK BRIDE. POLDOW, WELL, v. COLDSTONE. POLDOWN, in the Shire of Ross ; and in the Parish of Applecross. It is situate ou the Atlantic Oceau, and has a small Harbour ; close to which is abundance of shell marie. POLE, NORTH and SOUTH, v. DRIMSYNIE. POLG AVIE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Inchture. It is 9 m. S W. b. W. from Dundee. This is a neat Village, situate on the Northern bank ofthe Firth of Tay, with a pier and harbour for vessels of 60 or 70 tons burden. Great quantities of lime, and coals, are here imported. It is the property of Lord Kinnaird, who, in 1797, erected a large Granary here, capable of con taining 6000 bolls of victual. POLLOCK, v. EAST- WOOD. POLLOCK-SHAWS, in the Shire of Renfrew : and in the Parish of East- WTood. It is 3^ m. S W. b. W. from Glasgow. This is a populous Village, situate in a fine Valley, interspersed with trees, and watered by the river Cart, and Anldhouse Burn. On one side it is skirted with neat Bleach-fields in con-"], [551, "POL stant verdure ; on the other, with well cultivated inclosures : and affords from the surrounding eminence, a delightful prospect of a manufacturing yet rural Village. POLMAISE, in the Shire of Stirling; and in the Parish of St. Ninian's. This is a small Village. POLMONT, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 111 bolls 2 firlots 1 peck and 2 lippies of bear, 56 bolls of meal, and \u00a3152.. 10.. 10.

It is in the Presbytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2194, and, in 1811, war 1827. It is 3^ m. E. S. E. from Falkirk. This Parish is 5 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth ; and was disjoined from the Parish of Falkirk, in 1724. A considerable extent ofitisrich carse land, rising towards the South into the dry-field ; all of which, except a small muir and some Commonty, are under cultivation. It is bounded on the North by the Firth of Forth, and on the East by the river Avon : a small part of it is intersected by a short cut from Grangemouth, which is now the only navigable communication between The Great Canal and the Forth. Here are several con siderable Quarries of excellent free-stone. There are also several coal mines, ofa remarkably fine quality, chiefly belonging to The Duke of Hamilton: but the principal one, which was at Shieldhill, and which was let in lease to The Carron Company, has lately been relinquished by them, and the workmen re moved to their other coal-works in the neighbourhood of their extensive concerns. The climate is very healthy. Polmont gives the title of Baron to the Illustrious House of Hamilton. The Minister of Polmont has Stipend not only from his own Parish, but also from those of Falkirk, and Denny. POLMOOD, v. DRUMMELZIER. POLTALLOCH, v. KILL-MARTIN.

It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale."], [552, "POM The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 291, and, in 1811, was 307. It is 3 m. N. E from Greenlaw. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and about 2 miles in its utmost breadth. The soil is mostly clay, lying on a cold tilly bed ; other parts are gravelly, and some are sandy : on the North-West there is a considerable extent of muir. The whole of the Parish is inclosed, except a small Farm, and the Muir, which is allotted by The Earl of March mont, sole Proprietor ofthe Parish, to the use ofthe Village, for pasture and fuel. There are several extensive woods, and plantations. The Inhabitants are very healthy, although the Village is situate upon a wet and even swampy piece of ground ; in the middle of which, are two Thorn Trees, at about six yards dis tance from each other, around which, it was formerly the custom, for every new married couple, with their company, to dance in a circle : and from hence ori ginated the well known Scottish Song, \" At Polwart on the greeu, If you'll meet me the morn, Where lasses do conveen, To dance about the Tliorn.\" \u2014 Ramsay but this innocent custom has now fallen into unmerited disuse. Polworth gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble Family of Home, Earl of March mont ; having been made a Baronial Burgh, in 1587. In April 1696, Lord Polworth, when he was created Earl of Marchmont, was also made Lord Greenlaw7. POMONA ISLAND, or MAINLAND, one ofthe Orkneys. This is the largest ofthe Orkney Islands, extending from East lo West, which is its longest direction, not less than 30 English miles, and through that space discovers, in point of appearance, soil, culture, and elevation, a very considerable degree of variety : its breadth is by no means so great ; for, though it reaches nearly 16 miles on the West side, the East does not extend above five or six : and near the middle, it is so narrow, as to form a neck of land, which comprehends little more than a mile in length, dividing the Island into two Peninsulas. The spa cious and beautiful bay of Scalpa, bounds the one side of this Isthmus, and the Bay of Kirkwall the other: and the ground that lies between them is at once so flat, so damp, and, in other respects, of such a nature, as to render it probable that the sea some time or other has occupied the whole space between them. A ridge of hills, of no great height, rises towards its Eastern extremity, which,"], [553, "P O R stretches Westward along the North side ofthe Parish of Holm, suffers an interruption atrthe Bay of Scalpa, is continued again through a considerable part of the Parish of Orphir (where the direction is suddenly changed towards the North at nearly a right angle), and extends through the Parishes of Firth and Rendal, six miles distant from, and in aline nearly parallel to, the hills of Stroraness and Sandwick, the Western Boundaries ofthe Island. Through the whole of this extensive tract, the hills are generally green on the sides, many parts of which are very productive when cultivated ; and the summits are covered with such an excellent mixture of various sorts of grass and heath, as affords almost con stantly a secure haunt for multitudes of moor-game, as well as pasture for sheep, black cattle, and horses. This Island is divided into the Parishes of Evie and Rendal, Birsa and Harra, Sandwick, Stromness, Firth and Stennis, Kirk wall and St. Ola, St. Andrew's and Deerness, Holm and Paplay, and Orphir. The Mineralogy of this Island, according to Mr. Jameson, is by no means inter esting ; the whole of the Island, excepting a small portion near to Stromness, being entirely composed of sandstone, sandstone flag, shistose clay, and in one place limestone and basalt make their appearance. POOLEW, in the Shire of Ross ; and in the Parish of Gairloch. This is a Fishing Village, situate on the Northern bank ofthe river Ew , at its confluence with Loch Ew; and at the distance of 232-- m. N W. b. N. from Edinburgh. POOLTANTON, in the District of The Rhyns, and Shire of Wigtown; in the Parish of Old Luce. It is situate at the entrance ofthe small river ofthe same name, which unites with the river of Luce, within High-water mark. Here is a small Bay, but it does not afford sufficient depth of water for vessels above 60 or 70 tons burden, even at the highest Spring tides. PORT, or PORT of MONTEITH, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, Mr. Erskine, of Cardross \u2022' The Church is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunblane, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1569, and, in 1811, was 1659. It is 15 m. W. N. W. from Stirling. This Parish takes its name from the district of Monteith, in which it is situate. In the Northern parts, the surface is rocky and mountainous, and mostly covered with heath : but the Southern parts are more level, and, towards the banks of the Forth, are exceedingly fertile. Peats are in plenty, but are obtained with considerable trouble and expense. The climate is wholesome. vol. ii. 3 Z"], [554, "FOR There are several Lakes ; of which, the Loch of Monteith, and Loch Vennochar, are the most extensive, and noted for their romantic scenery.

A good road has been made from hence to Bridge-End, at the sole expense of Walter Camp bell, Esq., of Shawfield, the Proprietor: and, under the auspices of The Par liamentary Commissioners, an excellent road has been continued from Bridge- End to Port-na- Haven, the South-West extremity of Islay ; by which means an easy and perfect intercourse is effected across the whole Island. Port-Askaig is also connected with Keills, on the Main-land, by the Ferries of Feoline and Lagg, and the new line of road through the Island of Jura ; which supersedes the necessity of the Pacquet, to Loch Tarbert, and Loch- Gilp- Head, the ori ginal communication with the Main-land of Argyle.

This is a small Bay, situate a little to the South-West ofthe Promontory, called The Ord of Caithness, and where the Moray Firth is about 15 leagues in breadth. In the month of December, 1805, Mr. Telford \"reported to The Committee on the funds of The Forfeited Estates, that a small Harbour, capable of affording protection for coasting vessels and fishing boats, appears absolutely necessary for the improvement of this extensive County. The pro-"], [555, "P O R moting a Fishery along the Coast (where fish abound), and facilitating the im portation of coals, are alone important considerations, but the introduction of useful labour, suitable for the several adjacent districts, cannot be accomplished until there is a safe Harbour, and roads of Communication opened from the shore into the interior of the country.\" PORTINCAPLE, v.

PORT KINTRA, in The Isle of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : in the Parish ofKillviceuen. It is 35| m. W.S.W. from Achnacraig. A Fishing Station has been established here on the Farm of Creech, opposite the Isle of I-Colm- Kill, at which there are eight or nine boats constantly employed: and the an choring grounds in the immediate neighbourhood are so good, and so well pro tected by large rocks and high lands, that ships of large size frequently run there for shelter. Cattle are landed here every year from I-Colm-Kill, and from the Islands of Tir-Y, Barra, South Uist, &c, very frequently. Aline of road has been surveyed from hence, by Loch Bunesson, Loch Scredan, and Loch Spelvie, to the Ferry of Achnacraig, which, it is hoped, will ultimately be carried into effect. It is the property of The Duke of Argyle. PORT LETHEN, in the Shire of Kincardine ; and in the Parish of Ban chory Davinick. It is 7\\ m. S. from Aberdeen.

The name of this Parish is derived from St. Moak, in honour of whom a Priory was erected on the banks of Loch Leven : Port was pre- fixed to it, from its being the nearest land to the Isle of Servanus, and consequently the usual landing place from the Priory of Loch Leven, which was situate in that Island. It contains 6404 Scotch acres ; of which, about 4054 are arable. The surface presents an agreeable variety of landscape, of fertile fields, craggy mountains, rich meadows, and thriving plantations, lying around the beautiful expanse of water, Loch Leven. The arable land, which mostly lies at the East- ern extremity of the Lake, and on the banks ofthe river Leven, which issues from it, is light, early, and very productive. The climate is healthy. In the Bishop's Hill, are inexhaustible Quarries of lime-stone ; and there is also abun- dance of free-stone, and muir-stone, in several parts ofthe Parish. The Roads are in very bad order : and there is only one Bridge, across the Leven, which was built upwards ofa Century ago. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a good School, and School-house. Fuel is cheap, and in great abundance. On the Eastern bank of the Lake, stood the Monastery of Portmoak : it was founded by Eogasch, King of the Picts, deriving its name from St. Moak, the Prior of it, and was consecrated to The Holy Virgin: it originally belonged to the Culdees, and had considerable possessions : on the 5th of October 1570, it was united to St. Leo- nard's College, by John Winram, Sub-Prior of St. Andrew's ; and it is now so entirely demolished, that only as much of one corner of it remains, as to show the place where it was erected. The beautiful and spacious Lake of Loch Leven, which is half surrounded by this Parish, is about 12 miles in circumference, and is interspersed with four small Islands : it abounds with fish, and aquatic fowls, of various kinds, and is a source of very considerable emolument to the Proprie tors. On St. Serfs Isle, which contains about 48 English acres of good pasture, was situate tlie ancient Priory of Loch Leven, dedicated lo St. Serf or Servanus; it is said to have been built by Brudeus, the last but one of the Pictish Kings, who gave the Island to the Monks or Culdees of Servanus : in the begin ning of the Twelfth Century, it was annexed to the Priory of St, Andrew's, by David the First ; and Patrick Graham, Archbishop of St. Andrew's, who died a prisoner in Loch Leven Castle, in 1478, was buried within its Chapel : the ruins ofthe Monastery are still visible. The Caslle of Loch Leven, anciently a Royal residence, stands on another Island in this Lake, of about two acres in extent : it was granted by Robert the Third to Douglas, Laird of Loch Leven,"], [557, "P O R and was formerly a very strong place : In 1335, it sustained a memorable siege by Sir John de Stirling, one of the Partisans, and aprincipal officer of Edward Baliol, who, under the protection of Edward the Third of England, contested the Crown with David the Second: after the Assailants had several times attempted to take it by storm, and had as often been repulsed, they adopted the plan of damming up the river which flows from the Lake, expecting thus to raise the water so high, as to drive the besieged out ofthe Fortress : the water con tinued to rise daily, and they thought themselves sure of success, when the English General, and most ofthe troops, having left the camp, to celebrate the festival of St. Margaret, at Dunfermlin, the besieged then siezed the favourable opportunity, and broke down the dam ; on which the water rushed out with such impetuosity, as to overwhelm the camp ofthe English, and to throw them into the utmost confusion : the besieged then returned to the Castle in triumph, and were no more disturbed : at the Eastern extremity of the Lake, some remains of this dam are still to be distinguished. \u2014 The circumstance, however, which renders this Castle particularly conspicuous in Scottish history, is the confinement of the beautiful and accomplished, but unfortunate Queen Mary, after she had se parated from Bothwell, and was made captive by the Confederate Lords, at the battle of Pinkie : here she was under the care of the Mother of Murray, who had been married to Douglas, of Loch Leven: this woman, whose manners are repre sented to have been as rude as her conduct had been irregular, and who bore an implacable hatred towards Mary, treated her with great indignity ; here the disconsolate Queen suffered all the miseries ofa rigorous captivity, which she en deavoured to mitigate and solace, by practising those accomplishments which she had learned in happier times ; amusing herself alternately with her needle and the lute, singing those beautiful effusions of Lyric poetry, which are attributed to her pen ; here, too, she was forced to sign a resignation of her Crown to her son, and the appointment of Murray, as Regent, a person whom she utterly de tested : several attempts were made to rescue her, which the vigilance of her Keepers rendered abortive ; but, in the family who exercised the hateful office of Gaolers, she found a deliverer ; and that in a gallant Youth of Eighteen, George Douglas, her Keeper's younger brother ; who, captivated by her charms, and touched with pity for her misfortunes, stole the keys of the Castle from his brother, released the Royal prisoner, and conveyed her from the Island to the opposite shore, where she was received with the utmost joy by Lord Seaton, Sir James Hamilton, and a few more of her zealous friends.

No more the glance Of blazing taper through its windows beams, And quivers on the undulating wave : But naked stand the melancholy walls, Lash'd by the wint'ry tempests, cold and bleak, That whistle mournful through the empty halls, And piece-meal crumble down the towers to dust, Equal in age, and sharers of its fate.\" It is the property of the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Douglas, Earl of Morton, and to whom it gives the title of Baron Douglas, of Loch Leven, in England, so created on the 30th of July, 1791. Andrew Wintan, Prior of Loch Leven in the reign of James the First, was a native of this Parish : he wrote \" The Loch Leven Chronicle,\" in Scotch metre, a Copy of which is preserved in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh, and is frequently consulted by later wri ters. John Douglas, of the family of Pittendriech, the first Protestant Arch bishop of St. Andrew's, was also a native of Porlmoak. Oliver Cromwell, after defeating the Royal army at lnver-Keithing under the command of Sir John Brown, of Fordel, halted in this Parish, in his way to Perth, and lodged in the house of Kirkness: this Estate then belonged to, and is still possessed by a branch of the Morton Family. In the East corner of the Parish are the ruins of The Castle of Arnott, which was in the possession of a Family of that name, upwards of 600 years ; it now belongs to the descendants of Sir John Bruce, Bart. , of Kinross.

PORT PATRICK, in the District of The Rhyns, and Shire of Wigtown: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a385.. 11. .8. out of the Teinds, which sum, with \u00a38. .17. .9\u00a3. paid by The Earl of Stair to the Minister of Stranraer, is the full valued Teind of this Parish : There is also paid by The Earl of Stair out of his Teinds in the Parish of Inch \u00a36.. 3. .4. in money, and 16 Galloway bolls, or 2 chalders of meal standard, together with \u00a335..11..0. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe consists of about twelve or thirteen acres: Patron, Sir David Hunter Blair : The Church was built iu 1629, and is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Stran raer, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident' Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1090, and, in 1811, was 1302. It is 132 m. SW.b. S. from Edinburgh, The Town is delightfully situate, with a fine Southern exposure, and defended on the North by a semicircle of small hills. It is an excellent Sea-bathing place, and is much frequented during the Summer months. Here is a very fine Quay, with a reflecting Light-house ; and four elegant Packet-Boats regularly sail between this Port and Donaghadee, on the Irish coast, with the Mail and Pas sengers, the distance being only 21 miles : Mail-Coaches are also established from Edinburgh and London to Port Patrick, and from Dublin to Donaghadee. The principal trade carried on here, is the Importation of black cattle, and horses, from Ireland. The great improvements of the Town and Harbour are chiefly to be attributed to the exertions of the late Sir James Hunter Blair, Bart. This is a favourable situation for an extensive Fishery, particularly of cod. It is probable, that Port Patrick was the ancient popular name of this Place ; although it is called, in old Charters, Port Montgomery , from a Noble Family of that name, who, at one time, possessed large tracts of land on both sides ofthe Irish Channel. They were ennobled by the Title of Earl Mount- Alexander,"], [560, "P O R which became extinct in 1758. They are not now in possession of any of their Scotch property, but their Representatives still inherit a considerable Estate in Ireland. \u2014 The Parish of Port Patrick is about 4\\ miles square, and the greater part is moor-land, and abounds with mosses. The surface is uneven, and hilly; the highest eminence, the Cairnpat, being elevated 800 feet above the level of the sea. The climate is temperate, and very healthy. The common fuel is peat, which is in great plenty, and cheap. Dunskey Castle stands about half a mile South from the Town, upon the brink ofa tremendous precipice which projects into the Irish sea, and has been secured on the land side by a ditch and draw bridge, the remains whereof are still visible : like many other ancient buildings, it lies under the imputation of being haunted with evil spirits : it is at present the property ofthe Representative of Sir James Hunter Blair, Bart., who mar ried the Heiress, and has an elegant modern house in the neighbourhood : Mr. Grose has preserved two Views of it. Near the Castle, is a Cave, which is holden in great veneration : and it is usual, at the change ofthe moon (which is still considered with superstitious reverence), to bring, even from a great dis tance, infirm persons, and particularly ricketty children, whom their Parents often suppose to be bewitched, to bathe in a stream that pours from the hill ; and afterwards to dry them in the Cave. PORTREE, or PORT a ROI, i. e. The King's Harbour, in the Isle of Skye, and in the Shire of Inverness: formerly a Chapelry, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was not quite 1000 merks Scotch, and the glebe is about \u00a36. per annum more : there is no manse: Patron, The Crown : There are four places of Wor ship, but only one Church, which was built a few years after the erection of the Parish, in the year 1726 ; it is slated, but rather small, and indifferently seated within. It is in the Presbytery of Skye, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Islands of Raasay, and Ronay) was 2246, and, in 1811, was 2729. It is 12f m. N. from Sconcer. The Fairs are holden on the last Wednesday in May, and the last Wednesday in July : to which all Skye, except the Districts of Strath, Sleat, some from Uist, and Harris, bring their cattle : these Fairs commonly continue from Wednesday 'till the following Saturday ; and the numbers that, on these occasions, flock from all parts to Portree, are immense ; and though there is a large, commodious, and well kept Inn at Acresaid, many persons are often put to great inconvenience for lodgings. Five miles South from Acresaid, at the Meeting of the three principal lines of Road in Skye, is the Inn and Post-Office of Sconcer; from,"], [561, "P O R which, by means of two runners, and the Post from Inverness to Dunvegan, all the letters of Strath, Sleat, Trotternish, and Mingnish are distributed. This Parish is about 9 computed miles in length, and about 3 miles in breadth. The surface is agreeably diversified with hills, vallies, and plains : on the East side ofthe Island, the Coast is very rugged, with cliffs nearly perpendicular ; as is also the Coast of Portree, on each side ofthe mouth ofthe Harbour, rising, par- ticularly towards the North, to a stupendous height. In the rocks are many caves of great extent. From the height ofthe hills, and proximity ofthe sea, the air seldom continues long of the same temperature here : it is, however, not un- wholesome. The most remarkable Hill is called Ait Suidhe Thuin, i. e. Fingats sitting place, and from whence the prospect is very extensive. There are many fresh water Lakes, particularly Loch Fad, and Loch Leathan, or The Long and Broad Lochs, which contain great plenty of white and red trouts, flounders, and eels : and the water that issues from Loch Leathan is precipitated over a very high and steep precipice, which forms a singular and beautiful cascade. Here are two Danish Forts, and an old Castle, formerly the seat ofthe Lairds of Raasay. Game, and aquatic fowls of all kinds, are very abundant. The greater part of this Parish is more adapted for pasture than tillage : yet, although the soil is not very fertile, it might with proper management be made to produce much more plentiful crops. Lord Macdonald, and Mr. Macleod, of Raasay, the latter of whom is generally resident, are the only two Heritors. The School in this Barony is numerously attended, and well conducted. It is abundantly supplied with excellent peat. The language generally spoken here, is the Gaelic. The Harbour is safe and commodious, with excellent anchorage, and is well sheltered at its entrance by the Island of Raasay. This Parish is so called, from the cir- cumstance of James the Fifth of Scotland, who had curiosity to visit the Islands, anchoring in the Port : And Kingsborough, the Seat of Mr. Macdonald, is so distinguished, because the King lodged here. \" We were entertained at Kings- borough,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" with the usual hospitality by Mr. Macdonald, and his Lady Flora Macdonald, a name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour. She is a woman of middle stature, soft features, gentle manners, and elegant presence.\" \u2014 Under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, an excellent road has been made, which connects the Sconcer and Snizort roads. PORTSBOROUGH, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of St, vol. ii. 4 A"], [562, "P O R Cuthbert. This Burgh of Barony is denominated Portsburgh, from its Vicinity to the West Port or Gate of Edinburgh. And its origin is said to be owing to the King's Stables, which were situate just Avithout the said Port, opposite to the Castle, on the South side of the way leading to St. Cuthbert's. At the West end of these stables was a Chapel, dedicated to The Virgin Mary, the Vestiges whereof are still to be seen at the foot of the Chapel Wynd. Adjoining to this Chapel on the West, is a pleasant green, which is the remaining part of the Royal Tilting-ground. The Superiority of Portsborough was bought by The Town Council of Edinburgh, in 1648, of Sir Adam Hepburn, Knt., of Humby: And, in 1661, theydbought of James Boisland the Superiority of the King's Sta bles. The Districts of Portsborough and Potter-row forming one Jurisdiction, are governed by a Baron (who is one ofthe old Magistrates of Edinburgh), and two Baillies his Assistants, who are appointed by the Common Council of Edin burgh. These Magistrates in their Court of Barony, try all causes both Civil and Criminal, except capital offences. The Officers belonging to Portsborough are the Baron, two Baillies, a Treasurer, Town-Clerk, Fiscal, two Constables, and two Serjeants or Town-Officers. In this neighbourhood is an old irregular Building, of a good appearance, called Wright's Houses: which is said to have been built for the reception ofa Mistress of King James the Fourth. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of it. The Mansion-house of Mar chiston is of very, ancient date, and was once the seat ofthe celebrated John Lord Napier, Baron of Mar chiston, well known for his admirable and useful discovery of the Logarithms : and \" to whom,\" says Mr. Hume, \" the title of Great Man is more justly due, than to any other whom his country ever produced.\" Mr. Grose has also pre served a view of Marchiston Tower. PORT SEATON, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Tranent. A village, at the distance of 2 m. N. b. W. from Tranent. It is situate on the Firth of Forth, and has a small Harbour, which was formerly much resorted to. Its chief export is Salt : and here a manufactory of fine Salt was established by Dr. Schwediaur, some years ago, but it did not succeed. See, Tranent. PORT-SKERRY, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Reay. It is situate at the confluence of the river Halladale with the Northern Ocean, and is an eligible situation for a Fishing village. PORT-SONACHAN, in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle; and in the Parish of Kill-Chrenan. It is 9 m. SW. b. W. from Dalmally. It is"], [563, "POT situate on the Eastern bank of Loch Ow, over which there is a Ferry here, with a coriimodious Inn. This road, which is the shortest to Bunaw and Oban, runs along the water of Naint, through the romantic Forest of Muckaim. PORTSOY, in the Shire of Banff ; and in the Parish of Fordyce : Here is a Minister, who is presented by The Earl of Seafield, with a Salary of \u00a320. per annum. It is 171| m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. This is a considerable trading and fishing Village, situate at the bottom ofa Bay ofthe same name, on the Moray Firth. A species of jasper is found here, called Portsoy marble, which is quarried and manufactured into various ornaments. There is a Subscription School, with a fixed Salary of \u00a315., besides School-fees. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have also a School here, with a fixed Salary of \u00a38. , together with \u00a35. from The Countess Dow ager of Findlater ; the value of \u00a32. in land from The Earl of Seafield, as a Cow's grass ; \u00a32. as Clerk and Treasurer for the Poors' funds at Portsoy ; and about \u00a37. more, as School-fees. There is likewise another School for boys, where from 20 to 30 are educated. A beautiful granite, of a flesh colour, is discovered here ; which contains a quantity of feldt spar, and shows a brilliancy like the Labrador spar : this species of stone was originally found in Arabia ; and, ex cept at Portsoy, it has not been met with in any other part of the world. Dr. James Hutton has given a very interesting and particular description of this singular and elegant stone, in the First Volume of The Philosophical Trans actions of Edinburgh. Here is a considerable manufacture of thread. A regular weekly Market is holden here, which is well supplied. PORT VAISGAIG, v. TONGUE. PORT WILLIAM, in the District of Machers, and Shire of Wigtown; in the Parish of Mochrum. It is 8| m. S. W. from Wigtown. This is a neat, small Village, situate on the Eastern shore ofthe Bay of Luce, and was founded by Sir William Maxwell, Bart., of Monreilh, in honour of whom it is named. The Port though small, is commodious and safe, and admits vessels of upwards of 200 tons burden. From hence all the exports, and imports of the Parish are made. In 1788, small Barracks were erected here for the accommodation of the military, and custom-house officers, who are occasionally resident, for the pre vention of contraband trade. The Bay of Luce every where, but especially near this Village, abounds with a variety of excellent fish. POTARCH, v. KINCARDINE O'NEIL. 4A2"], [564, "P R E POTTER-ROW, v. PORTSBOROUGH.

This Estate belongs to Major Thomas Ogilvy Fotheringham, now a prisoner in France (1812), having been taken with the wounded after the battle of Talavera; and who is also Proprietor of Myretown, Whitehouse, Middle Brighty, and Mill of Brighty. It was long the residence of that ancient Family, who have since removed to an elegant Seat, named Fotheringham, in the Parish of Inverarity. The family of Fotheringham have always possessed considerable political influence in the Shire of Forfar, on account of the extent of their pro perty and its high valued rent, which enables them to enroll the different Mem bers of their House as Freeholders. The Castle of Powrie is mostly in ruins, as it has not been inhabited by the family since the Revolution. POYNTERFIELD, v. KIRK-MICHAEL. PREMNAY, in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe: the manse is in good repair : Patron, General Hay, of Rannes: The Church was lately re built. It is in the Presbytery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 486, and, in 1811, was 534. It is 2\\ m. S. S.W. from Old Rayne. This Parish contains nearly 3000 acres, exclusive of the uncultivated and uninhabited part ofthe Mountain of Bennochie ; of which, 2000 are arable, and the remainder are inclosed, and planted. Along the banks ofthe Gady, the soil is in general both fertile, and early. The Mountain ofBen nochie is a Royal Forest, though there are no trees now upon it, except about its base ; it is elevated nearly 1000 feet above the level ofthe sea, and supplies the inhabitants ofthe neighbouring Parishes with peats for fuel ; and with remark ably fine granite, which is much esteemed, and carried several miles distant. The knitting of stockings is the principal manufacture here. PRESS, in the Shire of Berwick ; and in the Parish of Coldingham. A"], [565, "PRE Village, situate 43f m. E. b.

It is situate, nearly two miles South- Westward from Bonkle, and two miles and a half North from Dunse. Here is a Bridge over the river Whittadder. PRESTON, in the Shire of Hadington; and in the Parish of Preston Pans. A Village, comprehending Northfield, and Schaw's Hospital, and though at present but small, was formerly of considerable exteut. It is about a quarter of a mile to the South of Preston Pans. The Barony of Preston, including Preston Pans, was long the Property ofthe Hamiltons, of Preston. George Hamilton, who was the Proprietor of Preston, when this Parish was erected, was succeeded by Sir John Hamilton, of Preston, who, in 1617, obtained from James the Sixth a Charter, erecting Preston, and Preston Grange, into a Burgh of Barony, with the usual Privileges. In 1647, Thomas Hamilton, of Preston, was retoured heir of entail and provision of the late John Hamilton of Preston \" nepotis sui patris.\" Thomas enjoyed this Barony for some time after the Restoration. It was sold, in 1704, by Sir William Hamilton, of Preston, to Dr. James Oswald, who also purchased from him Fingalton, the Family estate ofthe Hamiltons, in the Shire of Lanark. At Preston, there is the ruin of a Tower, in which the Hamiltons resided: it was accidentally burned, in 1663; And, some years afterward, Preston-House was erected, which, by the Will of the late proprietor, James Schaw, was, iu 1784, converted into an Hospital, for maintaining and educating Twenty-four boys : four names having a preference, in the following order, \u25a0Schaw, Macneil, Cuningham, aud Stewart : the Lands and Barony of Preston are appropriated to their support. Preston was formerly noted for a Fair holden in an open field adjacent, on the second Thursday of October, called St. Jerome's Fair, at which there was a general Meeting of the travelling Chap- men or Pedlars of the Three Lothians, to elect their Officers for the ensuing- year : but, about the year 1732, this Fair was transferred to Preston Pans, where it was holden for about Twenty years, and was then given up : In the year 1636, they acquired a right to the Cross here, which they still preserve : and so much is Preston now decayed, that this Cross stands at a short distance in a Field. On the East ofthe Inclosures of Preston is the field of battle, better known by"], [566, "PRE the name of Preston Pans, where Prince Charles Stewart, commonly called The Young Chevalier, at the head of his Highland army, completely routed the English forces, on the 22d of September 1745, under the Command of Sir John Cope, who was afterwards tried by a Court-Martial for his conduct in this battle, and acquitted : he is said to have left the field in such haste, that he never once stopped his horse, nor looked back, until he got to Hadington. The High landers, in their accounts, usually gave it the name of The Battle of Glades- Muir ; though Glades-Muir is at least three miles distant from the scene of action. There was, it seems, a tradition among them, that a battle was to be fought on \" The Moor of the Gledes,\" which, in the issue, would insure to the \" rightful Sovereign\" the peaceable possession of his Throne ; they made the application that was most favourable to their views. See, Preston Pans. PRESTON, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; and in the Parish of Kirk bean. It is 14 m. S. from Dumfries. This Village, now decayed, is said to have been a Burgh of Regality, and had the privilege of four Fairs in the year. Nothing now remains of its ancient privileges ; but, at a Cross of about 7 feet in height, still standing, poinds have lately been comprised. The Castles of Cavens, and Weaths, a part of each of which only now remain, were once the property ofthe Regent Morton, and were frequently inhabited by him ; Upon his forfeiture, these Castles, with the Barony of Preston, on which they are situate, were granted to the family of Nithsdale, one of whom gave the chief part of that Barony to a second son, and feued out the rest : the whole, excepting two Farms, is now the. property of Richard Alexander Oswald, Esq., of Auchencruive, who, while occasionally in this part of the country, resides at The Castle of Cavens.

A General Post-Office is established here. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and from three to four miles in breadth, con taining 4498 Scotch acres : the surface ofthe ground is agreeably varied, and the soil is exceedingly fertile, and well cultivated. The river Tyne winds through the middle ofthe Parish, and empties itself into the German Ocean, about three miles East from the Church, on a flat sandy beach. The only considerable eminence in the Parish is Traprene Law, anciently called Dun-Pender, a solitary rock, of an oval form: and which, from the remains of an old wall round the extremity of its summit, is supposed to have been used formerly as a place of safety ; it is elevated about 700 feet above the level of the sea, and forms one of the most conspicuous objects to mariners, after entering the mouth of the Firth of Forth: the view from it is very extensive. Smeaton House, is the elegant residence ofthe Honourable Baron Hepburn. It is worthy of record, to the honour of this Parish, that Mr. John Walker, tenant in Beanston, set the first example of fallotcing ground, in this part of the Island, now so generally adopted. The Village of Preston is very ancient ; and there appears to have been a Church here, in very early times, on the Northern bank ofthe Tyne : it was one of the Villages where Baldred preached ; and was one ofthe three Villages, which contended for his body, after his decease, in the Seventh Century. Baldred was long the Patron of this Parish, which be had dignified by his residence; and, by tradition, built the ancient Church : his statue laid long in the Church yard, and Mr. Baron Hepburn intended to have caused it to be built into the wall ofthe new Church, in 1770 ; but, an irreverent mason broke it into pieces, during his absence. In the vicinity ofthe old Church, the Chancel of which re mains, and is the burial place of the Family of Smeaton, is a spring ofthe purest water, called St. Baldred' s Well; and a Pool or Eddy in the Tyne, is still known as St Baldred' s Whirl. In the Twelfth Century, this Parish was called Linton, from the name ofthe Village, on the Northern bank ofthe Tyne, some what above Preston : and on the establishment of the Collegiate Church of Dunbar, the Church of Linton was made one of the Prebends, and indeed the most valuable of any of them : Linton continued to be the name ofthe Parish, until the Reformation: though it was even, then colloquially called Haugh or The Halch, from the situation ofthe Church on aflat or haugh, on the margin of"], [568, "PRE the Tyne. Close upon the South bank of the Tyne stands Hailes Castle, in formertimes the Seat of the atrocious Earl of Bothwell, and where it is said The Earl of Morton met him, to concert the murder of Darnley, during the first week of December 1566 ; and which was so flagitiously perpetrated, on the 10th of February following : it was demolished by Cromwell, in 1650 : It aster wards became the property ofthe late excellent and venerable Sir David Dal rymple, who, as one of The Lords of Session, was intituled Lord Hailes ; and whose \" Annals of Scotland\" are universally known and admired : it now- be longs to Miss Dalrymple, his eldest Daughter. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of it. PRESTON PANS, in the Shire of Hadington : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3192. ; together with a glebe ; the manse was built, in 1782: Patron, The Earl of Hyndford : The Church was re-built, in 1774, and is a neat and commodious place of Worship. It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting ofthe Villages of Cuttle, Dolphinston and Dolphinston Mains, Preston including Northfield and Schaw's Hospital, Preston Grange with. Drummore, and the Town of Preston Pans) was 1964, and, in 1811, was 1995. It is 8 m. E. from Edinburgh. There is a good Butcher's Market in the Parish every Wednesday, and Saturday. A Penny Post-Office is established here. The Monks of Newbottle, who obtained a grant of Preston, before the year 1189, from Robert de Quincey, and who had the honour of discovering Coal within their Lands, established a Salt-work here, which gave rise to the name of Preston Pans : and, at the beginning of the last Century, it was commonly called Salt Preston. This Parish was created, in 1606, by the Parliament of Perth ; by dismembering the Parish of Tranent, and by endowing a newly erected Church, in Preston Pans. It comprehends the two Baronies of Preston and Preston Grange, which are commonly called The East and West Baronies. The Charter erecting the East Barony, was granted in favour of Sir John Hamilton, of Preston, in 1617 : and by it Preston, and Preston Pans, are erected into a Burgh of Barony, with the usual liberties and privileges. The West Barony is that of Preston Grange. It is about5milesinlength,andonemile in breadth, and contains about t)54 Scotch acres : the surface is level , and the soil loamy ; partly on a gravelly clay, and partly on a gravelly bottom ; and the greater part is inclosed, and well cultivated, pro ducing good crops of all kinds of grain. It is noted for its extensive manufactures,"], [569, "PRE particularly of Salt, stone and earthen ware, and bricks and tiles : a manufacture of Oil of Vitriol, Aqua-fortis, and Spirit of Salt, has also been carried on ; and the same Company manufacture great quantities of Glauber Salts. The chief Fishery is that of Oysters, which has long been an object of importance : of late years, many have been sent to England, which has almost destroyed the Oyster scalps by over-dredging : the Oysters of Preston Pans have long been esteemed, especially those dredged near the doors ofthe Salt Pans, and from that circum- stance named Pan-door Oysters. The only harbour in the Parish, is Morison's Haven, so called from a family ofthe name of Morison, who were formerly Pro- prietors ofthe estate of Preston Grange ; about the beginning ofthe Eighteenth Century, it was called New Haven, and often Acheson's Haven, from an an- cient Family, the progenitors of the present Earl of Gosford, in Ireland : it is situate a little to the West ofthe Town, and has about 10 feet of water at stream tides, but might be deepened so as to draw twelve feet : it is esteemed one ofthe safest Harbours in the Firth of Forth. A Custom-House is established here, the Jurisdiction of which extends from Tlie Figgat Bourn on the West, to the Mouth ofthe Tyne on the East. The Port is Morison's Haven : the Creeks are, The Figgat Bourn, Mussel -Burgh, Port Seaton, Aber-Lady, and North Ber- wick. There are Thirty-one Salt-Pans in the Collection, viz., 11 at Cockenzie, 4 at Preston Pans, 2 at Cuttle, 4 at West Pans, 4 to the West of Fisher- Row at Pinkie Pans, and 6 at Dudingston Pans. A Stage-Coach goes to and returns the same day from Edinburgh, every day in the week, except Sunday. The Schoolmaster's house, which contains the School -room in part of the ground floor, was built in 1790 : the School-fees are very moderate, and it is well attended. There are also three other private teachers. On the 2d Thursday of July, The Travelling Chapmen ofthe Three Lothians meet annually here, and elect some of their number, for the purpose of holding Courts to enforce the observance of Bye-Laws, to which they are bound at their entrance into the Society: they elect, on this occasion, a Provost or Preses, a Depute, a Clerk, a Treasurer, 6 Baillies, and several Counsellors : there is one Baillie for Preston Pans and Cockenzie ; one for Hadington and North Berwick ; one for Dunbar and Oldhamstocks ; one for Mussel-Burgh and Dalkeith ; one for Queensferry and Borrowstown-Ness ; and one for Linlithgow and Bathgate : This annual Meeting was formerly holden at Preston ; but their number is now much dimin ished, and they are still on the decline.

PRIESTWICK, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Monktown: Divine Service is now discontinued here ; but the Church still remains, and serves as a Land-mark for. vessels navi gating the Firth of Clyde. This is a very ancient Burgh of Barony, and by its Charter, which was renewed and confirmed by James the Sixth at Holyrood- House, on the 19th of June 1600, it is empowered to elect annually a Provost, and two Baillies, with Counsellors, and to grant franchises for several trades ; and to hold a Weekly Market, and a Fair on the 6th of November : but most of these Privileges are fallen into disuse.

It is a Valley, about two English miles in length, and one mile in breadth. It is bounded on the East by the sea, and part ofthe Parish of Lerwick ; on the West, by Cliff Sound, which divides it from the Islands of Burray, and Trondray ; on the South, by the Parish of Cunningsburgh ; and on the North, by the Parish of Tingwall. This Parish contains 93 merks of land, besides outsets, which are not included in the Rentals. There are five large fishing boats here, which are fitted out at a considerable expense. The soil of this Parish is clay, and, in ordinary seasons, produces tolerable crops, though rather late, on account ofthe wetness of the ground. The inhabitants of Quarff are frequently employed in transporting goods, from one side ofthe country to the other, which brings them in considerable sums. See, Bressay, Isle.

This is a small Village, situate on the Northern bank ofthe Firth of Forth, opposite to the Royal Burgh of South Queen's-Ferry, between which places there are regular passage-boats. Separated from the Bay of Inver-Keithing, by a small Head-land, is that of St. Margaret; the place where that Illustrious Princess, afterwards Queen of Malcolm the Third, landed with her brother Edgar in 1068, aster their flight from England, to avoid the consequences of the jealousy of the Conqueror, on account of the title of the former to the Crown. This Passage is also called the North Ferry, or North Queen's- Ferry, being afterwards her constant passage to and from her favourite residence at Dunfermlin. Here was formerly a Chapel, which was served by the Monks of Dunfermlin, and endowed by Robert the First. Near it, were the great Whin-stone Quarries, from whence such an abundant supply of paving stones is procured for the Streets of London. An Act of Parliament having lately passed for the improvement of this Passage, accompanied by a Grant of upwards of Twelve Thousand Pounds Sterling, very great additions have in con- sequence been made to the Landing places and Harbours ; and the Passage Boats are now under excellent Regulations. A Superintendant, appointed by the Trustees, waits constantly at the North Ferry to give directions for the pro per and expeditious conveyance of Passengers. There is a neat signal House built upon the Rocks on the North shore, containing apartments for the accom modation ofthe Trustees, Superintendant, and Boatmen. QUEEN'S FERRY, SOUTH, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdic tion, locally situate in the Shire of Linlithgow.

This Place was first distin-"], [573, "QUE guished in the Charters of Malcolm the Fourth, by the designation of \" Passa- gium Regin\u00e6,\" from the frequent use of this Ferry by his Great-Grand- mother, Margaret, Queen of Malcolm Canmore, a Princess celebrated for her charit- able and beneficent virtues ; and who was the great Patroness of the Town. Queen's Ferry, although it had long been a Port, was not a Borough, in 1556, when a general Tax was levied on the Royal Boroughs : and its erection as such, was strenuously opposed by the jealousy of Linlithgow. It now, in conjunction .with the Royal Boroughs of Stirling, Inver-Keithing, Dunfermlin, and Culross, sends one Member to Parliament. It is governed by a Provost, one Land-Bail- lie, two Sea-Baillies, a Dean of Guild, and a Town Council ; who, like most of the other Counsellors of Royal Boroughs are self-elected. The present Revenue ofthe Corporation is only \u00a340. The Parish, is of small extent, consisting only ofthe Borough ; the Royalty not extending to the two ends of the Town. The Climate is remarkably healthy ; and it is much resorted to, as a pleasant and convenient situation for Sea-bathing in the Forth. The principal Manufacture is brown soap. The Harbour is in good repair, and vessels navigating the Forth are often obbged to run in here in hard gales. But the Shipping of the Port has greatly declined ; and, at present, it seems to derive its sole consequence from the Ferry over the Firth : The breadth of this Passage is about two miles ; it is safe and expeditious, and may be had at all times, except in a very few cases ; and that only in high winds, or at particular and unfavourable times ofthe tide. There is much obscurity about the founding of this Ferry. The right of it is private property ; and seems originally to have been attached to the lands of Murie-Hall, which lie in the neighbourhood, consisting of about 17 acres, and are said to have been gifted by Queen Margaret, for upholding this Passage. The present Proprietors are several Gentlemen, both on the South side in the Shire of Linlithgow, and on the North side in the Shire of Fife. Until lately there were two descriptions of Proprietors, \u2014 the Proprietors ofthe Water -Passage, and the Proprietors of the Boats and Yaivls plying on the Passage. The latter consisted of several persons, Ship-masters and others, who erected themselves into what is called a Boat Club, built and kept in repair a sufficient number of boats and yawls, and took leases from the proprietors of the Water- Passage, by which they were entitled to ply on this Ferry. Such was the practice until the year 1784, when the proprietors of the Water-passage, refusing to grant leases to the Owners of boats and yawls, purchased the whole of them, and have since let them yearly by roup: and by this change the Public have gained several advan tages.

The surface is much diversified ; part of it being low, flat, and fertile ; and part of it elevated, moorish, and rocky. The soil also varies from a deep and rich clay, to a hot and blowing sand, or moorish gravel. The climate is healthy. None ofthe hills are remarkable for their altitude ; they are principally covered with heath, abounding with excellent peat and turf for fuel, and affording extensive pasturage for sheep and black cattle. Here are two valuable quarries ; one of them of free-stone, the other of grey slate. The exten sive and beautiful estates of Tarras, and Cluny, belong to The Earl of Moray. The Barony of Blervie, a valuable estate, is the property of The Honourable Lewis Duff, who has a very neat modern House there.

RANNOCH, in the Shire of Perth ; partly in the Parish of Logie-Rait, but principally in the Parish of Fortingal. This district is 21 miles in length, and about a mile in breadth ; and contains 32 villages, three of which belong to the Parish of Logie-Rait. It is highly elevated ; and the air is particularly moist, damp, and cold. The soil is in some parts tolerably good ; but in others, it is exceedingly bad, and mildews often prove very destructive to the crops. Loch Rannoch is 12 miles in length, and about a mile in breadth ; and abounds with perch, and trout of a great size. Here are many large woods of Birch, and a pretty extensive natural wood of Fir, which supplies the adjacent country with excellent timber ; and is all that remains of the immense forest, which once covered the muirs in this part of the Highlands. From the Report and Esti mates, relative to the Rannoch Road, by Mr. Thomas Telford, Engineer, in May 1810, it appears, that, \" In improving the Highlands of Scotland, by means of Roads, Bridges, and Ferries, particular attention has been given ; \u2014 First, To open communications between the hitherto remote and almost inac cessible Districts on the Main-land and Western Islands, and the more cultivated part ofthe country, the principal Towns, Markets, and Fairs: \u2014 Secondly, To explore and establish general lines of practicable communica tion, which, as Drove Roads, might hest accommodate those extensive tracts from whence Black cattle and Sheep are sent to the markets in the Southern parts of Scotland. With a view to the immediate convnieence of the Highland Proprietors, and all persons having occasion to travel in that country, the formation of those roads vol. ii. 4 C"], [578, "RAN which fall under the first description, has naturally attracted the earliest attention. Communications ofthe second description, passing through the estates of many different Proprietors, very remote from each other, though of material importance to the interest of every individual, are scarcely known to them as objects worthy ofa combined effort. From this cause, the subject has hitherto undergone less investigation than it merits ; for, it is of importance, even to the Public, that the most direct and commodious communications with the extensive Cattle-rearing countries should be established. It is well known that the produce of the whole of the Western parts of Scot land, North-West of the Great Glen of the Caledonian Canal, and includ ing the Isle of Skye, consists chiefly of Black cattle, and Sheep, and that they are sent to the Markets in the South of Scotland holden at Crieff, Callander, Falkirk, and Dumbarton, from whence they are driven into England. The Dis tricts towards the Eastern side of Scotland being more arable than pasturage, do not furnish any great proportion of lean Stock. The chain of Lakes and Rivers which occupy The Great Glen, and the un broken mass of lofty mountains which extends along the Southern side of that valley between Inverness on the East, and High-Bridge, near Fort William, on the West, have hitherto compelled the Drovers to take such directions as enable them to pass either by the Eastern or Western extremities of The Great Glen, and of the ridge of mountains parallel to it. The principal communication has hitherto been by theWestern extremity, near Fort William ; but, previous to arriving at this point, the Highland drovers have hitherto passed through circuitous vallies, over rugged ridges of mountains, and dangerous and inconvenient ferries ; the delay, loss of cattle, and general em barrassment thus arising from the want of convenient communication, are strongly felt by the Northern Sheep farmers, and the Cattle dealers from the South who make purchases of them ; and, although the personal inconvenience and toil are more immediately felt by these two classes of men, it is obvious that the pecuni ary loss falls upon the Land Owners, and that the Public markets are the less abundantly supplied. Immediately to the South of Fort William the communication is difficult and circuitous ; for it is either by crossing steep ridges on the old Military road by the top of Loch Leven, and over The Devil's Staircase, or more to the Westward by crossing the Ferry of Ballahulish, and proceeding up the"], [579, "RAN rugged Pass of Glencoe to The King's House, at the West side ofthe Moor of Rannoch. From thence the communication continues across the Black Mount to Tyndrum, and afterwards Eastward down Glen Dochart towards Killin, at the head of Loch Tay, three miles short of which it turns Southward to Callander and Crieff. Near Tyndrum, at Fillan, a branch passes Southward down the West side of Loch Lomond to Dumbarton. The North-West part of Scotland comprising the principal rearing Districts, Inverness is much too far Eastward to answer for a general drove road, except for Sutherland and the Eastern parts ofthe Shire of Ross ; it is therefore to the Western extremity of The Great Glen we must look for establishing a better communication between the rearing countries in the Highlands, and the Cattle markets in the South. It results from the general conformation ofthe country, that the most important points upon this line of communication are High-Bridge, near the South-West end of Loch Lochy, and Killin, at the West end of Loch Tay. This is well known to all persons concerned in sending Sheep and Black Cattle in this direc tion to the Southward, and will appear evident from considering, \u2014 First, The Nature and Extent of the Communications from the North-West districts, which may be concentrated at or near to High-Bridge. \u2014 Secondly, The comparative facility of proceeding from High-Bridge to Killin : \u2014 and, Tliirdly, The Nature of the Communications from thence to the Southern Cattle Markets. First, Of the Nature and extent of the Communications from the North-West Districts, which may be concentrated at High-Bridge. The great extent of the Isle of Skye will always render it an object well de serving attention. Although it appears probable, that when the Loch Carron road and the Ferries connected with it are completed, the intercourse between Skye and the East coast of Ross and Inverness will be carried on in that direc tion ; yet, Kyle Rhea, on account of the narrowness of the channel, will always remain the usual Ferry for the Black cattle of Skye ; and this consideration, together with the importance of making a convenient outlet for the produce of the adjacent country of Glen Elg, and accommodating at the same time the districts of Loch Alsh and Kintail, will necessarily require a good road to be made from Kyle Rhea to the Southward. This communication must either be through Glen Elg by Loch-Houi-n-Head 4C2"], [580, "RAN and part ofthe Glen Garry road, or by Glen Sheil and the Rhiebuie Road, to a point on the Glen Garry road called Inch Laggan ; the reason of uniting them at this point is, that from thence a direct and easy line may be carried South ward by the East end of Glen Arkeg, and the West end of Loch Lochy, to High- Bridge. Glen Elg consists chiefly of two vallies, the general direction of both running nearly between Kyle Rhea and Loch-Hourn-Head ; those vallies are inclosed, excepting on the Sea-side, by ridges of mountains, through which there is no Pass lower than that over Marn-Raatachan. At the South end of the two before mentioned vallies there are Passes apparently of the same level as Raatachan, and about 1400 feet perpendicular above the level of the sea. Of these two Vallies, which have been diligently explored, the Eastern one is most convenient for a Road, which would pass through the finest part of Glen Elg, with an uni form ascent for about 12 miles from Kyle Rhea. Near the upper end of the valley the hills are steep, and much side-cutting would be required. From this summit to the head of Loch Hourn, the country is rough, and rocky, and near to the Loch very precipitous. By preserving an uniform declivity from the summit to the termination at Loch-Hourn-Head, a distance of six miles, a commodious road may be formed; but this would be accomplished at too great an expense, as the rock-cutting, breast-works, and parapets, would in many instances be an arduous task. From Loch-Hourn-Head there is for about three miles a steep ascent on the Western part ofthe Glen Garry road ; afterwards, that excellent Road may be considered as level. But the most commodious line of Road from the Isle of Skye and Kyle Rhea must pass through the Northern part of Glen Elg, and over Marn-Raatachan to Sheil-House (a distance of about 12 miles) by commencing the acclivity at a suf ficient distance on each side of that Pass ; and this may be done at a compara tively moderate expense. From Sheil-House by the summit of Glen Sheil to Rhiebuie the country is rugged, but not nearly so impracticable as the last six miles in Glen Elg, towards Loch-Hourn-Head. From Rhiebuie to the South ward across Glen Lyne to near Inch Laggan (a distance of 10 miles), a line suf ficiently level may be formed. By any road through Glen Elg to Loch-Hourn-Head, the Skye and Glen Elg communications to the Southward would be direct, but Loch Alsh and Kintail would be excluded from benefit, unless a road was also made over Marn-Raata chan, and even then their journey would be circuitous ; but what is of still greater"], [581, "RAN importance, the extensive tracts comprising the upper parts of Glen Morrison, Strath Glass, and of Loch Carron, would remain without accommodation, unless the road between Rhiebuie and Inch Laggan was made. By Glen Sheil and Rhiebuie to Inch Laggan, the summits to be passed over, and the distance to be travelled even by the Skye and Glen Elg cattle, would be more favourable than through Glen Elg, and by making a few miles of road between Sheil-House and Toteig-Ferry, the accommodation to all the other be fore-mentioned districts would be as perfect as the nature ofthe country admits. The comparative distances are as follow : By Loch-Hourn-Head. miles, yards. From Kyle Rhea to Loch-Hourn-Head - - - - 18 100 From Loch-Hourn-Head, by the Glen Garry Road, to Inch Laggan 17 1500 35 1600 By Marn-Raatachan and Rhiebuie.

To complete tbe communication on the North side of The Great Glen, instead of passing from Inch Laggan, ten miles along the Glen Garry rojad to Inver- Garry, and thence by the side of Loch Oich and Loch Lochy to High-Bridge (a further distance of about 18 miles), making together 28 miles, a road may be carried through a Pass ofthe Mountains immediately South from Inch Laggan, which would cross the river Arkeg near its mouth, and passing by the Western end of Loch Lochy, would arrive at High-Bridge by a route about ten miles shorter than the former, and without crossing a single Ferry."], [582, "RAN The comparative distances are as follow : From Inch- Laggan to Inver- Garry, From Inver-Garry to High- Bridge, miles, yards. 10 18. miles, yards. 28.

Difference in favour of the latter Road: and which is nearly equal to a day's journey for a drove of cattle or sheep. 10. 586. The Branch road between Sheil-House and Toteig Ferry, mentioned before as an useful auxiliary to the Main road from Skye, has been estimated at \u00a31943. It is almost 5 miles in length, and is wholly in the Shire of Ross. The expense of making a road from Rhiebuie to the Upper Bridge of Morrison (to which the Glen Morrison Road extends) would be \u00a33210. Of this Estimate \u00a31563. must be expended in the Shire of Ross, and this has hitherto operated as an obstruction to the undertaking, the road promising little benefit to that County. In addition to the Districts which have here been already considered, the Countries of Glen Arkeg, Mor'ar, and Arasaig, will conveniently centre their communications at High Bridge by means of the Loch-na-Gaul and Lochy- Side roads, and the Bridge constructed by The Caledonian Canal Commis sioners upon the new river course at Mucomer ; or otherwise by the Ferry of Lochy. Secondly, Of the Line from High-Bridge to Killin. Having stated the manner in which improved Drove Roads may be made to centre at High-Bridge, it is equally important to consider in what manner the communication can be rendered most perfect between that place and Killin, at the Western end of Loch Tay. At present the Drovers travel Southward sometimes along the old Military road from High-Bridge by Fort William to the head of Loch Leven, beyond which, from crossing sundry rugged and steep ridges, it is named The Devil's Staircase; or, in order to avoid this tedious and almost impassable piece of road, pass from Fort William down the side of Loch Eil, and crossing Loch Leven at Balla hulish Ferry, turn Eastward up Glencoe,"], [583, "RAN The road up Glencoe, though preferable to The Devils Staircase, is one of the most rugged in the Highlands ; the mountains on each side are extremely steep, and, from the action ofthe frost and rain, sheets of rocky fragments are formed, which are successively precipitated to the bottom of the Valley. In this direction it is impossible to avoid this dreadful Pass, because the Country to the Southward is equally rugged, composed of similar materials, and intersected by Lakes which penetrate far inland. From the junction of these two bad roads at the top of Glencoe, cattle pass on to The King's House, Eastward of which is an extensive open District, which in such a rugged country may be comparatively called a Plain ; it is named, The Moor of Rannoch. The Military road passes by the Western ex tremity of this Plain across the sloping skirt of a Hill, well known by the name of The Black Mount, at a height found by Mr. Nimmo to be 600 feet above the level of The King's House, and thirteen or fourteen hundred feet above the level ofthe sea. From The Black Mount, the Military road goes to Tyndrum, and thence Eastward down Glen Dochart, till it approaches Killin. The objections to this road are, its circuitous course, the danger and delay of the Ferry of Ballahulish, the difficult Pass of Glencoe and of The Black Mount, and subsequently the delay caused by passing Eastward from Tyndrum down Glen Dochart to near Killin. To remedy these very imperfect communications, a line has been suggested to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, and by their direc tion has been carefully examined, and reported as not only practicable but ad visable. It commences near High-Bridge, and passes considerably to the East of Ben Nevis, by the side of Loch Treag, and across the Moor of Rannoch direct to Killin. This line is not only very direct, but from the following description it will appear to be particularly level and easy, considering the rugged cha racter of the country. From near High-Bridge, the road would pass nearly on a level about seven miles along the Loch Laggan road to Tulloch, where it would cross the river Spean and ascend in an easy manner to the foot of Loch Treag, which is about 700 feet above the level ofthe sea; the Road would pass along the Eastern side ofthe Loch, from which, with few exceptions, the mountains rise with a regular slope, not much cut by torrents, and protected by natural Birch wood. The ascent to the summit, at the head of the Lake, may be rendered one in fifty : this summit continues about 8 miles nearly on the same level, and is about 1128 feet above"], [584, "RAN the sea : from hence the descent to the plain of the Moor of Rannoch is no more than 100 feet. Entering the Moor of Rannoch, the line must pass near the East end of Loch Lydoch, and over a flat morassy tract, in nearly a straight direction to the Pass of Gual Vearan; the head of which is the summit of this part of the country, from whence the water runs both to the Eastward and Westward ; it is 1400 feet above the level of the sea, and is gained by an ascent of about one in a hun dred. From thence to the head of Glen Lyon the rate of descent may be about one in fifty, and a moderate rise carries the line to the Pass, called Larig-na- Loone, at the head of Glen Lochy, down the North side of which the road may be carried along comparatively favourable ground, and at a descent not ex ceeding one in thirty to Killin. From High-Bridge to Killin, along the present road by Fort miles. William, Ballahulish, and Tyndrum, the distance is - 68. From High-Bridge to Killin, by the Rannoch Road - - 53. Difference in favour of the new line - - - 15. Thus it appears, that the saving of distance in this District would be 15 miles ; the ascents and descents much easier ; and no Ferry to be crossed.- These ad vantages may be reckoned equal to two, or perhaps three days journey for a drove of cattle or sheep. Thirdly, From Killin to the Southern Cattle Markets. From Killin, the communications after crossing by The Pass of Larig-Eilie and down Glen Ogil to the head of Loch Earn, pass Eastward in a direct line by the North side of this Loch to Comrie, and Crieff ;. or, by a shorter route, from Killin along the South side of Loch Tay for about six miles, and by the New Road through Glen Lednaig to Comrie, and from thence either Eastward to Crieff, or Southward to Dunblane, Stirling, and Falkirk. Southward from Loch- Earn-Head a road passes down the East side of Loch Lednaig to Callander, Doune, Stirling, and Falkirk, or from Callander to Dumbarton and Glasgow. From Killin, therefore, to the Southward, the communications are commodious and direct. In addition to this direct communication between the North-West rearino districts and the Southern cattle markets, this road, by passing from Hi\"-h-"], [585, "RAN Bridge through the interior of the country to Killin, affords many opportunities for collateral connection ; part of Strath Spey might be connected by means of the Loch Laggan road, and in another way by Loch Ericht. From the South side of the Moor of Rannoch a branch might conveniently unite with the present Military road, and pass by Tyndrum and Loch Lomond to Dumbarton and Glasgow, while another might be carried Eastward along Loch Rannoch and Loch Tumel to Dunkeld, Perth, and Dundee. Besides the line from High-Bridge to Killin, which it has been considered most advisable to recommend, all the other Passes ofthe adjacent country have been examined, ; but, as they have been found more or less objectionable, it is unnecessary to incumber this Report with any account of them. The advantages to be derived from thus lessening the distance, avoiding Ferries, and acquiring regular and easy acclivities throughout this extensive Drove road, are alone sufficient to demand the most serious attention of all the Land Owners in the North-West and Interior parts of the Highlands of Scot land : but, besides this first and most important object, the proposed line would also be the most direct and commodious communication for travellers of all de scriptions, from the Southern parts of Scotland to the aforesaid extensive Districts. The practicability of this important line of road having been ascertained, and its direction marked on the Parliamentary Map, the following is an Estimate of the expense at which the different portions of it may be completed : \u2014 .

And that a similar saving, and augmentation of value, will take place on 20,000 Black cattle, at 8s. each, to the amount of 8000. Estimated annual advantage, Total \u00a312,000. The subject of this Report being thought by The Commissioners for High land Roads and Bridges to be of very great importance, they ordered the Re port to be printed in a convenient form, with a Map annexed, and circulated for the general information ofthe Highland Proprietors, and their several County Meetings: \u2014 And, in their Report to Parliament, The Commissioners remark with peculiar complacency, \" The projected Road over Rannoch Moor stands single in the circumstance of having originated not from any application of others, but from Our own sense of its superior importance to a large portion ofthe High land Districts of the Counties of Argyle, Inverness, Ross, and even Perth. The general knowledge of Highland communications Southward, scarcely attainable by persons not extensively employed to facilitate that object, has strongly im pressed upon Us an opinion, that a Road across the Moor of Rannoch is para mount in utility to any that could be devised for the benefit ofthe Highlands of Scotland \u2014 And we shall conclude this subject, with expressing Our conviction, that, although many years might intervene before this Road could be undertaken by the unaided efforts of individual exertion, nevertheless, and in the course of progressive improvement, it would be ultimately accomplished ; but it is well de serving of consideration, that the present opportunity of obtaining that kind of Public aid, which operates as an efficient cause of immediate improvement, may not, if now neglected, be again offered to the Inhabitants of The Highlands.\" RANNOCH, ISLAND, v.

The sea-coast is partly flat and sandy, and partly low rocks : it possesses two Creeks, on which are built two Fishing villages that employ 6 or 7 boats each. The rent is paid partly in money and partly in victual, together with some customs, bondages, and personal services, though the three last are mostly abolished. Here are several veins of lime-stone, of a superior quality. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood of land. The old Castle of Cairnbuilg, now in ruins, was formerly the family Seat of Lord Saltoun's predecessors ; it was called Philorth, until it was sold by Sir Alexander Fraser, in 1613, to Fraser of Durris, when its name was changed to Cairnbuilg : And Sir Alexander then transferred its former name of Philorth to another House that belonged to him, about a mile to the West ward, which it still retains, and has been the Seat of the Noble family of Saltoun ever since. The Castle of Inveralloc hie, also in ruins, appears to have belonged formerly to the Cumyns, Earls of Buchan. RATHILLET, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Killmany.

Here is a well conducted School, the Master's Salary being 300 merks, together with a good House, and perquisites. The estate of Hatton, by far the most considerable in this Parish, was formerly the property of The Earl of Lauderdale, and long in the possession of that Noble family : this great estate was lately sold, together with the Patronage of the Church, to Miss Scott, of Scot's- Tarvet, now The Duchess of Portland, for \u00a384,000 : the house is a venerable old edifice, with extensive gardens, and surrounded with large plant ations and inclosures, of at least 800 acres. Dalmahoy is the principal Seat of the Ancient and Illustrious family of Douglas, Earl of Morton : it is finely situate in the middle ofa great Park, containing between sour and five hundred acres, inclosed by one of the best built walls in Scotland, and subdivided into commodious inclosures, by sunk fences and belts of plantation, forming altogether a beautiful and extensive domain : the pleasure grounds are modern, having been laid out by the late James Earl of Morton, President of The Royal Society of London, and Grandfather to the present Earl. From the summit ofthe South Platt Hill, immediately above the manse, fourteen different Counties maybe dis cerned. In 1315, the Barony of Ratho, and other Estates, were granted by Robert the First to the Steward of Scotland, in marriage with his daughter Margery, \" The Lass, who brought the sceptre to the Steward's House.\" On the accession of Robert the Second to the throne, in 1371, the Barony of Ratho, with its pertinents, and the other estates of the Stewarts, were settled on the King's eldest son and heir, as the Prince, and Steward of Scotland : and, the whole Estates of the Stewarts were formed, on the 10th of December 1404, into a Principality, with Regal Jurisdiction. Charles the Second, as Prince, and Steward of Scotland, granted several Charters to his Vassals, in the Barony of Ratho, and Ratho-Byres. When the Sheriffdom of Renfrew was settled, by dismembering the Shire of Lanark, the Barony of Ratho was disjoined from Lothian, and annexed to the Shire of Renfrew : and, in the titles of The Prince of Wales, His Royal Highness is Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Hereditary Great Steward of Scotland."], [589, "RAT RATHVEN, in the District of Strath-Bogie, and Shire of Aberdeen: an ancient Prebend, formerly belonging to The Church of Aberdeen, and now comprehended in the Parish of Cairnie : The Church is demolished, but the Burial place is still in use.

It is in the Presbytery of Fordyce, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of New Buckie, Findochtie, Porteasy, and Portnockie) was 3901, and, in 1811, was 4374. It is 3^ m. W. b. S. from Cullen. This Parish contains about 27,000 Scotch acres : the soil is various ; being in some places a light loam, extremely rich, on a bottom of clay; in others, it is thin, but abundantly fertile, on a red mud ; and in others, it is sandy, and also clayey : it is bounded on the North by the Moray Firth, for about 12 miles. The Bin Hill, in the South- East end of the Parish, is mostly planted with trees, and affords a good land mark, being distinctly seen at the distance of 12 leagues. The Climate is early, and healthy. Services, though not in general abolished, are exacted with such moderation, as not to be esteemed a grievance by the tenants. The White Fish ery on this Coast is in avery prosperous state ; there being, in 181 1, Forty boats, each containing at least 7 men, employed in it: these Boats also attend the Herring Fishery on the Coast of Caithness, for six weeks during the Summer. The Roads are in good repair : and there is now a Bridge over the Tynet, which separates this Parish from that of Bellie. An Hospital was founded here, in 1226, by John Bisset, for seven leprous persons : there are now six Bede-men on the establishment, but none of them live in the House, which is in bad repair: the nomination to a vacancy is in the gift of The Earl of Seafield, as Proprietor of Rannes; and their yearly Income is, as follows; from the lands of Rannes, every Bede-man has half an acre of land during his life, and one boll of oat meal annually; from the lands of Findochtie, 8s..l%d. ; and from Mr. Baron Gordon, as Proprietor of Freuchnie, formerly a part ofthe lands of Rannes, Is, A\\d, making in the whole 9s.. 6c/. yearly.

There are two Roman Catholic Chapels at Presshome, and Arradoul, which are conducted by their Ministers with the greatest propriety. The Salary ofthe Parochial School-master is 300 merks, together with a School house, School-fees, and a few perquisites. The Society for propagating Chris tian Knowledge have also a School at Couffurrach, near the Enzie Chapel, with a Salary of \u00a310. to the Master, and \u00a35. to his Wife. A part ofthe East end of the Parish is annexed to Cullen, quoad sacra, but the date ofthe annexation is not known. The plantations of The Earl of Seafield, which are in a thriving state, amount to 4300 acres. There are several Quarries of lime-stone, of free stone, and of slate ; there are also several Mineral springs, both of a chalybeate, and purgative nature. Peat, or Turf, from the hill of Oldmore, and the other mosses, is the Fuel in common use ; but, as the mosses are at a considerable dis tance, Fuel is extremely dear, and, in winter, often very scarce. Druidical Tem ples are common : and, on an eminence, near Woodside, is a large heap of stones, commonly called The King' s Cairn ; and which, tradition says, is the grave of Indulphus, an ancient king of Scotland, who, after obtaining a complete victory over the Danes, in 961, was unfortunately killed near this spot. The ruins of the old Castles, called The Green Castle, and the Tronach Castle, are still to be seen. There are two annual Fairs in the Parish ; one in July, for cattle, sheep, and merchant goods ; the other, for butter and cheese, in September \u2022 both of them are named Peter Fair ; but the latter has the epithet, Little, prefixed by way of distinction. There are 8 Heritors, only two of whom reside ; viz., Mr. Gordon, of Lettescourie , and Mr. Gordon, of Cairnfield ; both of whom have highly ornamented, and improved their Estates. In a small Bay, called The Holi ofGollachie, prodigious quantities of Sea- weed are driven ashore ; there are two Stell fisheries at that place, belonging to Mr. Baron Gordon, and Mr. Dunbar ; and lately a Lint-Mill has been established there by a manufacturer in Fochabers, for beating flax. On that part ofthe Coast, which belongs to The Earl of Sea field, are many Caves ; the most remarkable being Farskane's, Janet Corstair's, and The Cross Cave ; but the extent of none of them is known.

The surface is much diversified ; and the soil is tolerably fertile. The climate is very healthy. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in the manufacture of coarse linen cloth. The Salary ofthe Parochial school is 300 merks, together with school -fees, and per quisites. To the South-East of the Village, on a rising ground called The Castle Hill, are the vestiges ofthe Castle of Rattray, formerly the residence ofthe very ancient family of that name. About two miles to the Northward, is Craighall, situate on a rock 100 feet perpendicular, and almost surrounded by the river Cricht. Upon a Farm, called Standing Stones, are the remains of a Druidieal circle. Fuel is expensive. RAVELRIG, v. CURRIE. RAVENS-CRAIG, CASTLE, v. PATH-HEAD. RAVENS-CRAIG, CASTLE, v. PETERHEAD.

This Parish is about 17 miles in length, and 8 or 9 miles in breadth. Its general aspect is hilly ; but a considerable tract, bordering on the sea, is level : In the Caithness Division, the soil is gen erally fertile : but a great part of Strath Halladale, which is in the Shire of Sutherland, is shallow, barren, and more fit for pasture than for cultivation: yet, even there, the industry of the inhabitants, and the skilful use of manure, raise excellent crops. The air is dry, and healthy. The extent of the Sea-coast is computed to be about 9 miles \u2022 it affords the two Bays of Sandside, and Big house; and the Creek of Port Skerry, which is supposed to be capable of great"], [593, "RED improvement, and is an eligible situation for a Fishing Village : but the most improveable, and best Harbour in the Parish, is the water mouth of Halladale, where small decked vessels can lie in perfect safety. The principal Head-land is Fresgo-Head, near Sandside. Binra, the only considerable Mountain, is ele- vated about 1760 feet above the level of the sea. The shore at Borrowstown presents a number of small coves, and a strong natural arch, covered with green turf, on a level with the adjacent ground, and leading over a chasm, about 40 feet deep, into which the Tide flows. There are said to be no rats in Strath - Halladale, nor in any other part of Sutherland. Game, and aquatic birds of all kinds, abound here : and seals are numerous on the coast. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and also an acre of ground, for which the Master teaches two children. Personal services are exacted here. The Gaelic is the language chiefly spoken. Reay gives the title of Baron to the Noble Family of Mackay, who derive their original from Ireland, in the Twelfth century, under the reign of King William the Lion: and the occasion of their settling in the North is mentioned by Torf\u00e6us, as Captains of a number of warriors, to drive the Norwegians out of Caithness: Strath- Halladale is so called from Halladha Earl of Orkney, a Norwegian, who was slain here in the heginning ofthe Tenth century: the field of battle ii full of small cairns, with one adjacent and much larger than the rest over the com- mander in chief; and near it, is a little town, called Dal Halladale, or Hal- ladha 's field. It appears that many battles have been fought in this Parish in former times, but there are no traditions concerning them : in later times some bloody skirmishes happened betwixt Mackay of Strath- Naver, and Keith Earl Marischal ; and also between the people of Caithness, and Strath-Naver. The old Castle at Dunreay, is now in ruins. In the face of a rock near the sea at Sandside, are appearances of lead. At Bighouse, and Sandside, are good modern Houses. Drim Hallistin is the boundary to the North, between Sutherland and Caithness ; to which place a line of road was surveyed by Mr. Fulton, from Thurso, a distance of 14s miles. RED ABBEY, v. MELROS.

This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, extending along the banks of the rivers Almond, and Tay. The surface is uneven : but, on the banks ofthe rivers, it is flat and fertile. The climate is healthy. Fuel is expensive. The roads are good. This is entirely a manufacturing district ; at Cromwell Park, are a large Cotton-Mill, and Printsield ; the villages of Pitcairn- Green, and Battleby, are employed in the weaving of linen ; and at Loncarty, is an ex tensive Bleach-field ; all these manufactures are on the estate of Colonel Graham, of Balgowan, who possesses three-fourths ofthe whole Parish, and whose patriotic exertions will prove as lastingly useful and laudable, as his martial exploits are brilliant. A part ofthe manufacturing Village of Stanley is also in this Parish. In a detached part ofthe Parish, which runs along the foot of the Grampians, at the distance of 6 miles from the Church, are Quarries of blue slate. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees. Besides which, there are two private Schools ; one of them at Stanley, and the other at Cromwell Park. On the banks of the Almond, are the remains of a Roman Station. Loncarty is celebrated for the signal victory obtained by the Scots, under Kenneth the Third, over the Danes, by the exertions ofthe gallant peasant Hay, and his two Sons, who, with no other weapons than yokes which they snatched from their oxen then at plough, first put a stop to the flight of their countrymen, and afterwards led them on to conquest. The Noble families of Hay derive their descent from this rustic Hero, and, in memory ofthe action, bear for their arms the instrument of their victory, with the allusive Motto of sub jugo. Tradition relates, that the Monarch gave this deliverer of his country, in reward, as much land as a grey-hound would run over in a certain time, or a falcon would surround in its flight ; and the story says, that he chose the last. There is something heroic, adds Mr. Pennant, in this tale ; but, after all, the truth is, the Family may be derived from the ancient stock of de la Haye, of Norman origin. RED- HALL, v.

This is a very ancient Town, pleasantly situate near the Eastern banks ofthe Cart, over which there is a good stone Bridge. It was erected into a Royal Borough by King Robert the Second, who had a Palace here ; and is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, and 16 Counsellors. It formerly sent a Representative to the Scotch Parliament ; but, since the Union, it forms only part of a District, and is now one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Rutherglen, in returning a Member of the British legislature. The Commerce of the Town is inconsider able. The Town Council are Patrons of the Grammar School, which is ably conducted. In the course of the Seventeenth Century, the Town stood close upon the Southern banks ofthe Clyde, and vessels of considerable burden could unload at the Town ; but the Clyde having changed its course, a plain of great 4E2"], [596, "R E R extent was left between the Town and the river : to obviate this, and to afford the Town the advantage of shipping, a large Canal has been made in the old bed ofthe river, by which vessels of 200 tons burden are brought to the Town at Spring tides : another Canal has also been made, to accommodate the Inhab itants of Paisley. The Parish of Renfrew extends about 3 or 4 miles in every direction. The soil is chiefly a rich loam, and the whole is inclosed, and well cultivated. The climate is particularly healthy, though subject to frequent heavy rains. The great road, from Glasgow to Greenock, runs through it. This is the Shire Town, where the County meetings are assembled, and the Justices of the Peace hold their Quarter Sessions. The Burgh lands contain about 100 acres. The mode of conveyance across the Clyde, by the new Ferry, belonging to the Town, is very singular, and particularly convenient. It is made in the Dutch manner, and can admit carriages to pass over without unharnessing the horses : and it is of great utility in conveying lime shells from the Shire of Ren frew to the Shire of Dumbarton. A Sketch ofthe Boat is given in the Agricul tural Report for Renfrew, p. 8. RENFREW, SHIRE. This is one ofthe smallest Shires in Scotland ; being only about 24 miles in length, and 12 miles in breadth, and is principally appro priated to the pasturage of black cattle, and sheep. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 78,056, and, in 1811, was 92,596. It sends one Member to Par liament. It is watered by the river Gryfe, from which circumstance it is some times termed Strath- Gryfe. The Shire of Renfrew is often denominated, by way of pre-eminence, The Barony of Renfrew, because it was the ancient inheritance ofthe Royal House of Stuart ; and because it now has the honour to give the title of Baron to The Heir Apparent of The Crown. . , RENNYH1LL, v.

RERRICK, or RERWICK, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a383.. 6.. 8., exclusive ofthe allowance for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe is upwards of the legal quantity : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of The"], [597, "RES Abbey, and Auchencaim) was 1166, and, in 1811, was 1224. It is 6\u00a3 m. S.E. from Kirkcudbright. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, stretching along the coast ofthe Sohcay Firth, at the Western entrance ofthe river Urr. The surface is rugged and uneven ; and, towards the North, terminates in the Mountain, called Bencairn, which is elevated about 1200 feet above the level ofthe sea. The soil is in general wet and spungy ; but, by pro per cultivation, is rendered sufficiently productive. The climate is healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is apportioned betweeen the Master at The Abbey; and the School at Auchencaim. Fuel is expensive. The Firth abounds with a variety of Fish. Upon the coast are three Bays, which have been laid open, and declared by Act of Parliament to be free Ports, viz., Balcarry, Port Mary (so named from the circumstance of Mary Queen of Scots, taking shipping there, after the battle of Langside, in 1568), and Mullock Bay : the first of these is safe, and commodious by nature ; and the other tw7o might easily be made so, espe cially that at Port Mary. Here are various remains of Roman and Saxon anti quities. The Abbey of Dundrennan, which is now in ruins, was founded by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, in the year 1142, for monks ofthe Cistertian Order, who were brought from Rievaulx, in Yorkshire. The last Abbot hereof was Edward Maxwell, Son to John, Lord Herries ; after whose death, King James the Sixth annexed this place to his Royal Chapel at Stirling. The Chronicle of Melros is thought to have been written by an Abbot of this House, From its ruins it is evident, that it was once both a beautiful and extensive Pile ; but it is now miserably dilapidated. Alan, Lord of Galloway, surnamed The Great, Constable of Scotland, was buried here in 1233. It now belongs to Thomas Cairns, Esq., who purchased it some years ago of the family of Curry. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. RESCOBIE, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a355. Sterling, 64 bolls of meal, and 32 bolls of bear: the Manse is delightfully situate on the North side of the Lake or Loch, which goes by the name of the Parish : It has lately received an addition of two elegant Rooms in front ; but the roof of the addition being flat, and covered with a new cement of pitch, chalk, and sand, boiled together, does not yet promise to be efficacious : the Glebe consists of about 7 acres : Patron, The Earl of Strath more : The Church is too small for the number of inhabitants, and is not well seated. It is in the Presbytery of Forfar, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 870, and, in 1811, was 920."], [598, "RET The Church is 3 m. East from Forfar : But the Parish itself extends as far as the west end of Forfar, on the North side of the Town. It is ofa Aery irregular figure, and is estimated to contain about 18 square miles, mostly in cultivation. The soil in some parts, especially on the Estate of Carse, the property of Charles Gray, Esq., and who is the greatest Heritor, is very rich strong land, and carries heavy crops : In other parts, the soil is partly clay, and partly thin sharp land, and by the active, industrious spirit of the Farmers, many of whom are in easy circumstances and very respectable, and by their contiguity to marl, which is obtained in abundance from the Lochs of Rescobie, and Balgavies, and the Moss of Restenet, the whole is of late years much improved. The Loch of Rescobie, which occupies the middle part of the Parish, is about a mile long, and its greatest breadth, is nearly half a mile : It abounds with Pike, Perch, and Eels. The salary of the Parochial School is 400 merks Scotch ; the School master's house is not very large, but it is pleasantly situate, and has a pretty good garden. The free-stone of The Hill of Turin is particularly excellent ; and from the Quarries in the neighbourhood, a great deal of stone for Pavement, and Slates, are shipped off at Arbroath to various parts of Scotland, and England. On the Summit of Tlie Hill of Turin, which commands an extensive view ofthe surrounding country, the site of an ancient fortress, called Kemp or Camp Castle, is still distinguishable. On the Estate of Balraadies, the property of Mr. Rait, of Armislon, is a Cemetery, with many tomb-stones still remaining ; but the Chapel has long been demolished. The House of Bumside is the neat, com modious residence of General Hunter : It was built only a few years ago by the General's Father : It commands a good view to the West, has a fine lawn in frout skirted on both sides with young thriving wood, and, in summer, is one of the most delightful places of residence in the County. Turin-House, though usually stated in the Gazetteers to be in this Parish, is in the Parish of Aber- Lemno ; but part of Mr. Watson's (the Laird of Turin's) property is in the Parish of Rescobie ; and, he has a house in it, called Drimmie, where he usually dines.

This is a Country Seat of The Earl of Wemyss, which was built by his Lordship about 25 years ago, upon his Estate of Blacker stone. The elegant simplicity ofthe Architecture, the neatness and convenience ofthe different apartments, and the style in which the grounds around it are laid out, express the correct taste of the Noble Proprietor : whilst its retired situation on the banks of the Whittadder, in the heart of a mountainous country, together with natural wood, and the extensive plantations with which it is surrounded, render it a truly delightful and romantic Retreat. RHIEBUIE, in the Shire of Ross : and in the Parish of Kintail. An excel lent line of road, of 10| miles in length, has been made from Rhiebuie in Strath Cluny to Inch Laggan in Glen-Garry, by The Parliamentary Commissioners. This road will be of great utility for driving cattle to the Southward from the Islands, and from the West side of the Shire of Ross. See, Rannoch. RHOE, LITTLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles; and constituting part of the Parish of Delting. It is situate on the North coast of the Parish, in Yell Sound, and is inhabited by two Families. RHOE, MICKLE, one of the Shetland Isles ; and constituting part of the Parish of Delting. It is situate on the South-West coast, and is 24 miles in cir cumference. It is inhabited by fourteen Families, who live upon a few spots which have been brought under cultivation along the sea-coast : the other parts ofthe Island are covered with heath, that affords good pasturage for sheep, cattle, and horses. RHON-HOUSE, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; and in the Parish of Kelton. At this Village an annual Horse Fair (for one day only) is holden on the first Tuesday after the 17th of June, O. S., and which is one of the largest and best attended of any in Scotland. Here also a weekly Market for black cat tle is holden on Monday, from the beginning of October to the end of December every year. It is situate upon the great Military road, at the distance of \\\\ m. S. W. from Castle-Douglas. RHYND, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in decent repair: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent: Patron, Mr. Oswald, of Scotstown: The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 403, and, in 1811, was 393. It is 5\\ m. S. E. from Perth. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and one mile in breadth, stretching along the Southern bank of the river Tay. The"], [600, "R I C surface is in general fiat, and the soil is exceedingly fertile, being either a rich loam, or clay. The air is rather moist, but not unhealthy. Agriculture is con- ducted in a superior style here, and the greatest part of the Parish is inclosed with quickset hedges. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, toge- ther with School-fees, and perquisites. Coals are the common fuel. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Castle of Elcho, which has not been inhab- ited for many years, and is now in ruins, was a large and strong edifice. It belongs to the Ancient and Noble family of Charteris, Earl of Wemyss, to whom it gives the title of BaRon. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. About a mile West from the Castle of Elcho, close to the Tay, are the ruins ofa Nun nery at Orchard Nook : It is said to have been founded by David Lindsay, of Glenesk, ancestor of the Earls of Crawford, and his mother Catherine Abernethy, and to have been a dependency on the Monastery of Dunfermlin : the ruins arc situate in the midst ofa large Orchard, and from the ground which they occupy, it would appear to have been an extensive building. RHYNIE, in the District of Alford, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vic arage, with the Parish of Essie uuited; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 25 bolls 3-f pecks of meal, \u00a3130.. 10.. 9^ in money, and \u00a33.. 16.. 2. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists ofthe legal extent : Patron, The Duke of Gordon : The Church is in decent condition.

This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and nearly as much in breadth ; it lies in the District of Strath-Bogie, being watered by the river which gives name to that Lordship ; and the soil varies from a rich loam to a barren muir. The surface is irregular ; but the Hill of Noth is the only emi nence which deserves the appellation ofa Mountain, and which is elevated about 1000 feet above the level of the sea. The Salary of the Parochial School is 7\\ bolls of meal. The whole Parish is now the property of The Duke of Gordon, who is Patron of Rhynie: but The Earl of Fife, as Patron of Essie, has a Vice- Patronage of the United Parishes. On the moor of Rhynie, are the remains of a Pillar, which is said to have been erected in memory of an engagement fought there at a remote period. RICCARTON, v. CASTLE-TOWN. RICCARTON, v. CURRIE.

The salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a garden. Limestone is in abundance ; and the Parish is well supplied with excellent coals, at a reasonable price. This Parish is generally supposed to derive its name from Sir Richard Wallace, who resided in the vi cinity of the Village, and who is said to have been Uncle to Sir William Wallace, the celebrated Patriot. RICCARTON, in the Shire of Linlithgow ; and in the Parish of Linlithgow. A Village, principally the property of The Honourable and Reverend Mr. Hamilton. It is 2 m. S. E. from Linlithgow.

It is about 500 yards Westward from Chester-Lee. RID PATH, in the Shire of Berwick ; and in the Parish of Longfor-Macus. It is 8 m. N. W. from Dunse. From hence the Family of Ridpath derive their name. George Ridpath, who died Minister of Stichel, in 1772, made collec tions for the history ofthe Shire of Berwick ; and left for publication \" The Bor der History\" of the two kingdoms. It was published, in 1776, by his brother Philip Ridpath, then Minister of Hutton.

This Parish is estimated to extend about 13 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, and is watered by the small river Borthwick, and the river Ale, together with several small rivulets and Lakes, which give rise to these streams, and which abound with trout, of the best quality ; there are fine Perch, and Pike, in the Lakes, and in one of them, is an excellent red trout, which much resembles that of Loch Leven. Game is in plenty. It appears from the valuation ofthe land, that the part of this Parish which lies in the Shire of Selkirk, was within the bounds ofthe Royal Forest. The general appearance is hilly ; but none of the eminences are of extraordinary elevation : from the banks ofthe rivers the surface rises by a gentle ascent ; and the low grounds, except where beautified with planting, are in a state of cultivation. The higher grounds afford excellent pasture, interspersed with considerable patches of Moss. The soil, locally varying, is, in general, of a good quality : the greater part lies on a hard gravelly or rocky bottom, which renders it more proper for the pas- turage of Sheep, and of which a prodigions number are here fed, and with great repute. The autumnal rains are particularly violent, and sometimes of long duration. Notwithstanding the great moisture of the climate, to which the la- bouring classes are exposed, they are healthy, robust, and generally attain a good old age. Here are eleven Heritors. Peats are the principal fuel, which are abundant, and good. The Roads are tolerable. A new School-house was built in 1790, and the Master has the ordinary legal Salary, of 300 merks, together with some perquisites. The Church of Borthwick, the ancient Parish of which is comprehended in the Parish of Roberton, stood on the North-West side of Borthwick Water, at a place, which was formerly called Kirk-Bothwick, and is now named Borthwic-Brae ; this is said to have belonged to the Diocese of Galloway, and its Church-yard is still used as the principal burying-ground in the neighbourhood ; Grieve and Pott are the names most frequent on the Tomb-stones. There was also formerly a Chapel, opposite to the present Church at Roberton, in which Curates from Hassendean were wont to officiate ; its ruins may still be traced. It belonged to the Monastery of Melros. See, Has sendean. There are several remains of encampments and fortifications : one 4F2"], [604, "RON large square encampment, flanked by a rivulet, whose banks are steep, having the Borthwick in front, and artificial ramparts towards the hill, bears to this day the name of Africa ; this communicates with one of a semi-circular form, at the distance of two miles, situate on the steep and craggy bank of a rivulet, where there is a beautiful cascade. Between these, and other encampments ofa circular form , The Ca^roi/ (of which some vestiges, though with breaks, may still be traced) is supposed to have run. Craik-Moor, in this Parish, is a high Mountain four miles in length, about the middle whereof stood a stone, called Craik-Cross, which divides the Shire of Selkirk from Eskdale : from this Cross, in a clear day, the walls of Berwick may be discerned, at the distance of 38 miles, to the Eastward. ROBROYSTONE, v. CALDER RODONNO, v. LYNE. ROGART, in the Shire of Sutherland .- formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 800 merks Scotch, and 16 bolls of bear, together with a glebe : the manse was built in 1776 : Patron, The Countess of Sutherland : The Church was built in 1777. It is in the Presbytery of Dornoch, and Synod of Sutherland and Caithness. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2022, and, in 1811, was 2148. It is 7 m. W. N. W. from Golspie. The name ofthe Parish, it is said, is derived from Rogh Ard, i. e. Very high, from the peculiar situation of the Village, which is nearly on the summit of a high Hill. It is of an irregular square form, about 10 miles in extent in every direc tion. The surface is very uneven, being composed of two Vallies, called Strath Brora and Strath Fleet, which run the whole length of the Parish from East to West, and are about 5 miles distant from each other ; the interjacent space being a group of rocky hills, with an intermixture of moss. The sides ofthe hills, and the Straths, exhibit patches of arable land, ofa shallow and gravelly soil ; which, in the Straths, is liable to be overflowed. The climate is sharp and cold, and often attended with heavy rains, but is not unhealthy. Peats are abundant. The Countess of Sutherland is the principal Proprietor. The Roads are indif ferent ; nor are there any Bridges, except some of wood for foot passen gers. The Gaelic is the prevalent language. In almost every part of the Parish, there are traces of encampments, tumuli, and the remains of Pictish Buildings. ROME, v. BERTHA. RONA, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it"], [605, "RON constitutes part of the Parish of South Uist, being situate to the North-East of Benbecula ; and is very barren. RONA, ISLAND, off The Isle of Lewis, in the Northern Ocean. It is situate about 16 leagues from Eorapie Point, or The Butt of Lewis, and belongs to the Parish of Barvas. This Island is about a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth, and is inhabited by one family. It is rented by one ofthe Ness Tacks men, who annually sends thither a large open boat, and brings from it some corn, butter, oheese, a few sheep, and some wild fowls and feathers. Here is a Chapel, dedicated to St. Ronan. The rock Sulisker lies 4 leagues to the Eastward of Rona; it is a quarter ofa mile in circumference, and abounds with a great va riety of sea-fowls ; and the boat which goes to Rona, generally touches there for fowls and feathers. RONALDSAY, NORTH, ISLAND, one of the Orkneys: formerly a Vicarage, with the United Vicarages of Burness and Cross Kirk, in the Island of Sanday; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 300 merks, with manse, glebes, and Vicarages : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 400, and, in 1811, was 384. Thislslandis abouttwo miles long, and one mile broad : the surface is low and flat, and the soil sandy, with a mixture of red clay. The shores are low and rocky, affording a consider able quantity of sea- weed, from which 90 to 100 tons of kelp are made annually, on the average. A few years ago, a Light-House, 70 feet high, was erected on the North-East point of this Island. The coast abounds with fish. RONALDSAY, SOUTH, ISLAND, one of the Orkneys : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Burray : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a318.. 15.. 7. in money, including the Composition for Burray, \u00a331.. 10.. 6. Vicarage Teind paid in sundries, one meil of oat-meal, and 159 meils of bear or big : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church ofthe South Parish was repaired about 15 years ago; but the North Parish Church walls have, for several years, stood without a roof, ex posed to all the inclemency ofthe seasons. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Island, in 1801, (in cluding the North and South Parishes, and the Island of Swanay) was 1610, and, in 181 1, was 1631. It is about 7 miles long, and one and a half broad. The soil is extremely various in different parts of the Island ; it consists of clay, black loam, sand, and moss : in some places, it is of an excellent quality, but almost"], [606, "R O S every where shallow. It contains about eighteen square miles. The tenants, in general, are tenants at will. Although the Post goes weekly through the Island, yet a Road has never been made. The Climate is healthy. This Island is well furnished with harbours ; for, besides several places where ships may anchor for a short time, it has the safe and pleasant Road of St. Margaret's Hope (and where there is a considerable Village), on the North; and, on tbe West, tbe still more commodious Bay of Widewall. The Lobster fishery is much encou- raged here. There are four Water Mills, at which the twelfth part offals, and the fourteenth part ofbear, are paid ; and also two Wind-mills which grind bear only, and are paid with the sixteenth part. There are some tumuli, and the remains of several Picts' Houses ; amongst which, what is called The How of Hoxa, is very remarkable. In the middle of the beautiful vale of Paplay, on the brow ofa hill, is a rude monumental stone, sixteen feet high. At Bwuick, on the South West end ofthe Island, is a Ferry. This Island is low, excepting upon the Shores, where there are tremendous precipices, which have proved fatal to manv an unfortunate mariner. The whole Island, according to Mr. Jameson, is composed of sandstone, sandstone flag, and, in some places, shistose clay is to be seen. It appears, like all the other Orkney Isles, to have been formerly joined to Caithness, as the strata are similar. RONA'S HILL, v. NORTH-MAVEN. RONAY, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Portree. This Island is about 4 miles long, and nearly two miles broad ; and has a very rocky, and barren aspect.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Towns of Chanonry, and Rosemarkie, and the Country District) was 1289, and, in 1811, was 1312. It is \u00b1 m. N. E. from Fortrose. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the Western Shore ofthe Moray Firth. The soil is various ; being a fine black mould upon light gravel, in the neighbourhood ofthe Town, where there is a large and beautiful plain, which is well cultivated: in other parts ofthe Parish, the lands lie generally on a deep clay bottom, pro ducing oats in great abundance, and of an excellent quality. The climate is pure, and salubrious. The coast is bold, and rocky. Tlie Point of Chanonry Ness is the situation of the Ferry-boat that passes to Fort George, and is parti cularly safe and commodious. The Town of Rosemarkie, though not large, is of considerable antiquity ; having been erected into a Royal Borough by Alex ander the Second. About a mile to the West of it, stands the Town of Cha nonry, so called from its being the Chanonry of Ross, where the Bishop formerly had his residence, and which is now the Presbytery Seat. It was united to the Burgh of Rosemarkie, by a Charter granted by King James the Second in 1444, under the common name of Fort-Ross, now softened into Fortrose; which Charter was ratified by King James the Sixth in 1592, and confirmed in a still more ample form, by the same Monarch, in the year 1612. These Charters declare, that it was tobe \" entitled to all the Privileges, Liberties and Immunities, granted to the Town of Inverness.\" Fortrose is then spoken of, as a Town flourishing in the Arts and Sciences, being at that time the seat of Divinity, Law, and Physic, in this part of the Kingdom. Above Rosemarkie is a circular hill, called The Court Hill, which was probably, in ancient times, the place where Courts were holden, for"], [608, "R O S the Administration of Justice. Only a small part ofthe ancient Cathedral now remains : which is still used as a burial place by the Mackenzies, and other old families in this country. Near it, is a House that was probably the Vestry : it contains a vault below, with a strong arched roof, now converted into a Prison; and the upper part of it, is The Council Chamber of the Burgh. Though the Bishop of Ross was originally styled Episcopus Rosmarkiensis, tbe Cathedral Church stood in the Town of Chanonry, in a spacious square. There the Bishop resided, with a number of his Clergy ; so that there is scarcely a House in the Burgh, of any great value, but was formerly a manse belonging to some of the Chapter. The Episcopal see was founded by David the First, King of Scotland , but there is no certain account at what period the Cathedral was built, though it is said to have been a fine one, with a lofty steeple. Bishop Leslie also takes notice of the Palace, which stood at a little distance from the Houses of the Canons ; and he represents it, in his time, as a splendid and magnificent building. It is highly probable, that the Cathedral had suffered, at the Reformation, the fate of many others, although it be a current tradition here, that the greater part of it, together with the Bishop's Palace, was pulled down in the time of Oliver Cromwell. By his order, the stones were carried by sea to Inverness, about the distance of 8 miles, for erecting a Fort there, called Cromwell's Fort. No Chartulary belonging to the Bishopric has been discovered in Scotland. It is probable that Lesly, the last Popish Bishop of Ross, and the zealous advocate for the unfortunate Queen Mary, when he was obliged to go abroad, carried all the writs of the Diocese with him, either to France, or to Brussels, where he died ; and where these documents may still be mouldering in dust and solitude. See, Fortrose. ROSEMOUNT, v. MONTROSE. ROSEMOUNT, v. SYMINGTON. ROSENEATH, v. ROSSNEATH. ROSE-NESS, v. HOLM. ROSLIN, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of Laswade. It is 4 m. S. W. from Dalkeith. Roslin Chapel, which is one of the most entire pieces of Gothic architecture remaining in Scotland, is situate on a rising ground named Tlie College Hill, beautifully decorated with wood and water, and the river North Esk running in a deep rocky bed on its West and South fronts. This Chapel, which seems to have been originally intended for a more spacious build ing, was erected in the year 1446, by William St. Clair or Sinclair, Prince of"], [609, "R O S Orkney and Duke of Oldenburgh : it was dedicated to Sis. Matthew the Apostle and Evangelist, and founded for a Provost, six Prebendaries, and two Singing- Boys. It is profusely decorated with sculpture, both in the interior and exterior; and the Capitals ofthe Pillars are enriched with foliage, and a variety of figures, of exquisite workmanship. On the llth of December 1688, it suffered some injury from the fury of a mob. But of late years this beautiful Edifice was in great danger of becoming quite ruinous : which to the honour ofthe late General Sinclair, then Proprietor, was prevented, by a very considerable sum of money expended by him on its repairs : its height within, from the floor to the top of the high arched roof, is 40 f. 6 in. : breadth, 34 f. 8 in. ; and its length, 68 feet. Within the Chapel is a vault, the buryiug-place of the family of Roslin, the soil of which is so dry, that bodies have been found entire Eighty years after their interment : these Barons were buried of old in their armour, without any coffin : \" The late Roslin,\" says Father Hay in his Manuscript Memoirs, \" was the first who was buried in a coffin, contrary to the sentiments of James the Seventh, who was then in Scotland, and several other persons well versed in antiquity, to whom my Mother would not hearken, thinking it beggarly to be buried in that manner:\" and he adds, \" the great expense she was at in burying her Husband, occasioned the sumptuary acts, which were made in the following Parliaments.\" Roslin Castle, so well known by the beautiful Song and pleasing Melody which bears its name,-^- \" While Roslin Castle heard the swain, \" And echo'd back the cheerful strain,\" \u2014 stands on an almost insulated Rock, in the delightful glen on the North side of the river North Esk, which is wooded down to the water's edge : but its situa tion, though inconceivably romantic and pleasant, is very ill chosen for a Castle, being commanded by hills on both sides ofthe river: the access to it, is on the East side, by means of an arch over a deep gulley, and through a once strong gate : one ofthe buildings, converted to a dwelling-house, is still inhabited by the family of a Gardener, who rents the grounds, and are famous for their pro duction of Strawberries. It is uncertain when and by whom this Castle was first erected : it appears that William St. Clair, the Founder of the Chapel, lived in great state here. In 1554, it was burned, together wTith the Castle of Craig-Millar, and the Town of Leith, by the forces sent by King Henry tha vol. ii. ... 4 G"], [610, "R O S Eighth; and most ofthe present buildings seem to have been erected since that time. \u2014 \" Ewes and lambs on braes ran bleeting, Linties sang on ilka tree ; Frae the Wast, the sun near setting, Flam'd on Roslin's towers sae hie : Roslin s towers and braes sae bonny, Craigs and waters, woods and glen ; Roslin's banks, unpeer'd by ony, Save the Muse's Hawthornden.\" \u2014 Macniel. The Village of Roslin was formerly a place of considerable consequence : it was erected into a Burgh or Barony by King James the Second at Stirling, in 1456 ; with a weekly Market on Saturday, a yearly Fair on the Feast of St. Simon and St. Jude, and a Market Cross : and the same were confirmed by King James the Sixth, on the 16th of January, 1622 ; and by King Charles the First, on the 6th of May, 1650. A short distance North-West ofthe Castle, stands the two gable ends ofthe Parish Church, with trees now growing on its aisles ; but it is still used as a burying-ground. Near this place, the English army under John de Segrave, Regent of Scotland, received three defeats on the same day, the 24th of February 1302, from the Scots, under their Chiefs, Sir Simon Fraser, and Sir John Cuming. On the 21st of April 1801, Roslin was created a British Earldom, in the Ancient and Noble family of Erskine. Mr. Grose has pre served two Views ofthe Chapel, and Castle. ROSS, v. KILLFIN1CHEN. ROSS BAY, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright; and in the Parish of Borgue. It is 4 m. S. b. W. from Kirkcudbright. Here is a safe, and commo dious Harbour. ROSSIE, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Craig. It is situate near the Southern bank of the South Esk, at the distance of a mile and a half West-South-West from Montrose. Rossie Castle, lately erected by Hercules Ross, Esq., is a noble specimen of modern architecture: it is surrounded with extensive and luxuriant Woods, and an Estate of 1974 Scotch acres, of excellent land.

ROSSKEEN, in the Shire of Ross ; formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 80 bolls ofbear, and \u00a350. Sterling: the manse, and offices, are in good repair: there are two glebes, one adjacent to the manse, of 4 Eng lish acres of fertile soil, and the other contiguous to the ruins of an old Kirk, called None-Kill, i. e. The Church of St. Ninian, and consisting of above an acre and a half, in three separate parcels: Patron, The Honourable Mrs. Mackenzie : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Tain, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (includ ing The Ness of Inver-Gordon) was 2074, and, in 181 1, was 2390. The Church is 1| m. W. from Inver-Gordon. The inhabited part of the Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern coast ofthe Firth of Cromarty: here the soil is partly gravelly, and partly loam ; but in the Highland district, it is light and spongy, and is principally appropriated to pasturage. The climate is healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is situate near The Ness, is 300 merks, a good School-house, and perqui sites. Peats are in plenty. ROSS, LITTLE, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; and in the Parish of Borgue. This is a small Island, situate at the mouth of the Bay of Kirkcud bright ; the entrance between the Island and the Eastern shore being about a mile and a half across : it is safe and bold on both sides. About two or three hundred yards North-East from this Island, is the proper Road for vessels to anchor, where they ride in perfect safety, unless the wind sets in from South- West by South to South-South-East ; and even then, if it does not blow a very hard gale. In this road there is a depth of 16 feet at low water, and 40 at high water, the rise being about 24 feet. At half a mile's distance, within Little Ross, on the West side ofthe Island, there is a small, but safe harbour, called Bal mangan Bay. And, about two miles and a half within Little Ross, on the East side, there is a large Bay, called Torr's Lake, or Manx-man's Lake, where up wards ofa hundred large vessels may lie in safety, upon a soft mud or clay bot tom. The distance from the entrance into the harbour, up to the town of Kirk cudbright, is 5 miles. In stormy weather, when vessels can neither keep the sea, nor clear the land, the Harbour of Kirkcudbright is the best in the South coast of Scotland for shelter, and on that account is much frequented in winter. But the entrance into it being narrow, a strong tide setting right across, and nb Light-house to direct them, it is dangerous to run for it in the dark, and engage 4G2"], [612, "R O S with a Lee-shore. Many fatal accidents happen by ships missing the Harbour, and being driven, either into Wigtown Bay, or on the banks of the Sol way Firth. This Island, therefore, affords an excellent situation for a Light-house ; which might be erected at a small expense, and kept up on moderate terms. ROSSNEATH, anciently ROSS-NA-CHOICH, i. e. The Virgin's Promon tory, in the Shire of Dumbarton : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. Sterling: the manse was built in 1770: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Duke of Argyle : The Church was re-built in 1780. It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 632, and, in 1811, was 747. It is 12 m. W.b. N. from Dumbarton. This Parish is situate in the most Westerly part of the Shire, being a Peninsula, about 7 miles long, and 2 miles broad. Its surface exhibits a continued ridge of rising ground, without hill or mountain, although some parts of it are rocky : the soil is various, and on the coasts well cultivated, but the higher grounds are covered with heath. The air is dry, and healthy. Here is a Lake of about a mile in circum ference, which abounds with perch. The extent of coast is about 13 miles : the shore being partly sandy, and partly rocky, and abounding with various kinds of fish : the usual markets are Greenock, and Glasgow. There are two Bays, called Callivattie, and Campsoil; in the latter of which, there is good anchorage, and safe harbour for vessels of almost any burden. Here is a valuable Slate Quarry. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites. Peats are the common fuel : but a few families use coals, which are brought down the Clyde from the neighbourhood of Glasgow. It is said, that there are no rats here. The Duke of Argyle is the principal Proprietor, and occasionally resided in the Parish, until his noble Castle was unfortunately burnt to the ground, in the beginning of the year 1802 : but exten sive works are now carrying on here by His Grace. There is a Ferry over the Gare Loch, between the Parishes of Rossneath and Row ; the current is strong. The Church here was founded by the old Earls of Lennox, and consecrated to Tlie Virgin Mary. It was first united to the Royal Chapel of Stirling, by King James the Fourth, and afterwards dissolved. Although it is said by some, that this place was a Monastery of Canons Regular, founded as above ; yet, by the Cartulary of Paisley, it appears, that it was only a Parish Church, given by Amelec, brother to Maldw-in Earl of Lennox, to the Abbey of Paisley, in the reign of King Alexander the Second."], [613, "ROT ROSS, SHIRE. This is one of the largest Shires in Scotland; extending from the Eastern to the Western Seas, and having the Insular district of Lewis politically annexed to it. This extensive Shire may be divided in an Agricultural point of view into three districts ; viz., The East Coast, which is favourable to the culture of grain, \u2014 The Central Highlands, which are calculated partly for grain, and partly for pasture, \u2014 and The West Coast, which is principally adapted for pasture, being a dreary and mountainous region. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 52,291, and, in 1811, was 55,372. It sends one Member to Parliament. The Mackenzies, the Rosses, the Frasers, the Mackays, the MACRAES,and the Munroes, are the principal Clans: They speak Gaelic, and wear the Highland dress ; and they esteem Lord Seaforth their Chief, his Lordship being a Cousin of Kenneth, the last Earl of Seaforth, to whose estate he succeeded. Ross gives the Irish title of Earl to the Noble family of Parsons. ROSYTH, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : an ancient Parish, now comprehended in the Parish of Inver-Keithing : The Church is in ruins. It is 3f m. N. W. from North Queen's-Ferry. It is situate upon the Firth of Forth. The Castle, now in ruins, was the ancient seat of the Stuarts, of Rosyth, lineally descended from James Stuart, brother german to Walter, the Great Steward of Scotland, and father to King Robert the Second. There is a tradition, that the mother of Oliver Cromwell, being a daughter ofthe family of Stuart, was born in this Castle, and that the Protector visited it, during the time he commanded the army in Scotland. It is at present the property of The Earl of Hopetoun. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. \u2014 There is a good Free-stone Quarry on this property, close to the Beach, from which great quantities of Stones have lately been shipped to Leith, and used in building the new Docks there.

This Parish lies along the North bank of the river Spey, and is in a great measure surrounded"], [614, "ROT with hills, which are all covered with heath : the soil is in general dry and sandy ; and the crops are, for the most part, oats and barley. There is neither lime, nor marie, in the Parish. There are sour Heritors ;\u2014 The Earl of Seafield, who has about two-thirds of the Parish ; \u2014 Sir William Gordon, Bart., of Gordons town, who has the lands of Inchbeary, and Gerbety; \u2014 The Honourable Arthur Duff, who has the estate of Orton, and is resident there ; \u2014 and Mrs. Mac Dowal Grant, of 7lirndelly, who has the lands of Ackenway. Here are the ruins of an old Castle, which gives the title of Earl to the family of Leslie, and was for merly the seat of The Duke of Rothes, from whom the Ancient and Noble Family of Leslie is descended : It is now the property of The Earl of Seafield. ROTHESAY, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Island, and Shire of Bute : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe: the manse was built, in 1757 : Patron, The Marquis of Bute : The Church was built about the year 1690, and is dedicated to St. Broke. It is in the Presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle. The Resi dent Population of this Town and Parish, in 1801, was 5231, and, in 1811, was For the Borough _____ 3544.

S., in July, and the last Wednesday, O. S., in October. A General Post-Office is established here. This Town is excellently situate for trade, having a fine Harbour at the bottom of an extensive Bay, in which there is safe anchorage, and a good Pier. The herring fishery is prosecuted here with great success. The Royal Borough of Rothesay was enfranchised by King Robert the Third, in the year 1400, when its Castle was the Royal Residence, it now, in conjunction with the Royal Bo roughs of Ayr, Irvine, Inverary, and Campbell-Town, sends one Member to Parliament. A Custom-house was established here, in 1765. \u2014 The Parish of Rothesay is about 10 miles in length, and from three to four miles in breadth, occupying the Northern part of the Island, and indented with the four Bays of Rothesay, Kaimes, Keils, and St. Ninian's, all of which afford safe anchorage : the surface is hilly, but there are some small Vallies, which are exceedingly fertile. The Gaelic language is principally spoken here. Peat is the fuel gen erally used in the country district ; but coals, imported from Glasgow, at a great"], [615, "ROT expense, are the common fuel in the Town. The Castle, which was originally a Royal Residence, was, in succeeding ages, the principal residence of the An cient and Illustrious House of Stuart, ancestors ofthe present Noble Family of Bute, long the Hereditary Constables ofthe Kingdom : it continued to be their residence, until it was burned by The Duke of Argyle, in the troubles of 1685 : it is now fast mouldering away with age ; but The Marquis of Bute enjoys the title of Hereditary Constable of it. Rothesay has the honour to give the Scot tish title of Duke to The Heir Apparent of the Crown of England. This is the Shire Town, and where the County Meetings, Sheriff's Courts, and Courts of the Justices of the Peace are holden. Criminals are lodged in the County Gaol here, but are removed for trial to Inverary. Two of the Bishops of The Isles were buried iu this Church. See, Kill-Modan.

It is in the Presbytery of Strath Bogie, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Mill-Town) was 1061, and, in 1811, was 1067. It is 5 \\ m. N. from Huntley. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and from 5 to 6 miles in breadth. The soil is, in general, rich, and fertile : the pasture land bears only a small propor tion to the arable ; and there are considerable Plantations, and natural Woods. The Peat mosses are very extensive. Grassums are in use : but personal Ser vices are no longer exacted. Of late, a great part ofthe victual-rents were con verted into money at the rate of 12s. 6d. per boll ; and multure-rent, formerly every thirteenth peck, is now 3s. 6d. for every pound of farm-rent. The whole Parish belongs to The Earl of Fife, except about one-tenth part, which is the property of Major Alexander Duff. His Lordship occasionally visits his property here : but Major Duff constantly resides at Mayen, in this Parish, where he has built an elegant and commodious house, and has set a most laudable example in the improvement of his estate, by planting and inclosing. The Roads are good. The Salary of the Schoolmaster is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. Near the confluence ofthe Doveron, and Isla, is pleasantly situate The House of Rothiemay ; where, according to Buchanan, the unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots, passed one night, and her bed-room is still shown : The Abernethies, whom Buchanan,"], [616, "R O U mentions, were Lords Abernethies, afterwards of Salton : and the tragical fate of one of them is celebrated in a popular Ballad, called Frennet Hall: \u2014 \" When Frennet Castle's ivied walls \" Thro' yallow leaves were seen,\" \u2014 Aster the Abernethies, a Family of Gordons were Proprietors of Rothiemay, till the end of the Seventeenth or the beginning of the Eighteenth Century, when it was purchased by Ogilvie, whose son sold it to William Lord Braco, father of the present Earl of Fife : the most ancient part of the House, which was going fast to ruin, his Lordship has lately taken down, and has repaired and furnished the rest in a manner which does honour to his taste. Near this, is a Druidical Temple pretty entire. James Ferguson, the celebrated Astronomer, well known for his mechanical and philosophical genius, was born at The Core of Mayen in this Parish, on the 25th of April, 1710.

It is situate on the Southern bank of the river Spey. Here is an extensive Quarry of lime-stone, which is burned with wood, and much used for manure. The woods of Rothie-Murchus, which belong to Patrick Grant, Esq., of Downe, are very extensive. Here are two small Lakes ; in one of which, Loch-an-Elan, is an Island and a ruinous Castle, formerly the principal Seat ofthe powerful Family of Shaw. See, Duthel.

ROUSAY, ISLAND, one of the Orkneys : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Vicarage of Eagleshay united, the Stipend of which, as modified, on the 4th of March 1801, was 6 meils of malt, 6 meils of oat-meal, and 6 meils of bear meal, \u00a374.. 6.. 8. in money, and \u00a35. for Communion elements : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church, which is small, is dedicated to The Virgin Mary, and is"], [617, "R O U about five miles distant from the Manse. It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (in cluding the Islands of Weir, and Enhallow) was 864, and, in 1811, was 795. It is 9 m. N. from Kirkwall. This Island is situate to the West of Eagleshay, and is separated from it by a strait of a mile broad. The East side of it, on the declivity ofthe hills, is abundantly fertile ; and the same with propriety may be said ofthe South-West corner, around the Church, to some distance: only a narrow stripe near the shores is cultivated in other places : the whole of the middle space consists of pretty high hills, covered plentifully with heath, which affords shelter to abundance of moor-fowl ; and intermixed with grass of various sorts, for rearing and supporting great numbers of sheep, swine, and black cattle. These Hills have now ceased to blaze spontaneously at night, as they were said formerly to have done. All around the Island is safe anchorage for shipping of any burden. About 30 tons of kelp are made here annually. In full view ofthe Parish of Evie, and the Island of Enhallow, and the rapid river-like Sound that divides them at the mouth of a rivulet which tumbles in beautiful cascades from the hills, is romantically situate The House of Westness. This was, in remote ages, the celebrated abode of Sigurd, who shared the confidence of his supe riors, and entered so deep into the Councils and Transactions of his time, as to transmit his name to posterity. A plain, on the shore, about a quarter ofa mile to the West of this place, has on it immense piles of stones, evidently the ruins of some ancient structure ; around which are to be seen graves, formed with stones set on edge, as in some other Islands ; and the name of Swendroic, which it bears, points it out with great probability as the scene ofthe capture of Earl Paul, by Swein the son of Asleif, and the slaughter of his attendants, when he was with the basest intention carried a prisoner into Scotland. The ridge, known by the whimsical name of The Camp of Jupiter Fring, is about two miles to the North-East of Westness. Several Standing Stones are to be met with, but they are little more than half the height of those in other places : there are some tumuli on the South side of the Island near Frotit, and a very few Picts' Houses. There are no rats here. This is one ofthe most laborious charges in Orkney. The prevailing surnames are Craigie, Morwick, and Mainland. Along the course of the Trumbland Burn, and especially at a lin or little water-fall near the sea, is a considerable variety of native shrubs and plants, rather ofthe more ornamental kind ROUTING BRIDGE, v.

This Parish is about 14 miles in length, and about 3 miles in breadth, being bounded on the West, and South, by the Gare Loch, and the Firth of Clyde. The Eastern end ofthe Parish is tolerably flat ; but the greatest part of it is hilly, and, towards the North-East, it is mountainous : Ihe soil is in general light, and, where properly cultivated, abundantly fertile. The air is sharp, and healthy. The Sea-coast, which extends about 12 miles, is for the most part flat and sandy, and affords a plentiful supply of various kinds offish : the Town of Greenock is the principal Market. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. There is also a piece of land mortified by Mr. Glen, of Portincaple, for the support of another School master, and whose emoluments are at least equal to those of the Parochial School. The fuel commonly made use of, is peat or turf; but coals are likewise brought from the neighbourhood of Glasgow, the price of which is greatly increased of late years. The English language is generally spoken, though many understand and frequently converse in Gaelic. There is a Ferry over the Gare Loch, oppo site to the Church, between the Parishes of Rossneath, and Row. ROW, in the Shire of Perth : and in the Parish of Killmadock. It is 1^ m. S. E. from Doune.

James, was built in 1752 ; it is in good repair, and is commodiously fitted up. It is in the Presbytery of Kelso, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 949, and, in 1811, was 946. It"], [619, "R O X is 3^ m. SW. b. S. from Kelso. This Parish contains about 7000 acres ; the general appearance is flat and sloping, and the soil is mostly a rich loam, well calculated either for wheat, or turnip husbandry ; and the fields every where display the remarkable activity, agricultural spirit, and skill ofthe farmers. The grounds on the East end ofthe Parish, and those on the South side ofthe Teviot, are inclosed with hedge and ditch. There are ten Heritors ; The Duke of Roxburgh is Proprietor of one-half of the whole Parish, and bears consequently one half of all Parochial burdens, except the Minister's Stipend, of which, by law, he can greatly relieve himself, being Titular of all the Teinds. The only great Heritor who resided for any length of time here, was the late excellent and much lamented Nobleman, The Honourable Baron Rutherford, of Faming ton. The climate is very salubrious. The principal disadvantage under which this Parish and all the neighbourhood labour, is the great distance from coals, and a total want of every other species of fuel. The fine road from Berwick to Carlisle, passes through the South part of it, and is of substantial benefit ; as is also that which runs along the North side of it from Kelso to Melros. There is a hand some Bridge over the river Teviot, near Kelso ; and a Ferry over that river is kept at Roxburgh, which, by its intersection of this Parish, sometimes occasions inconvenience by floods. \u2014 The old City of Roxburgh stood over against Kelso, on a rising- ground, at the West end ofa fertile plain, peninsulated by the Tweed and Teviot, where these song-renowned rivers flow in all their glory, and unite their waters. On the Southern angle formed by a curvature ofthe Teviot, stood the magnificent Friary of tbe Franciscans, sounded by King David the First. Near it stood the City, and at the point ofthe peninsula stood the Castle, so often the scene of mortal contention between the Scots and English ; and before which, King James the Second unfortunately perished by the bursting of a Cannon. The Castle, which is now entirely a ruin, was formerly the rendezvous of some of the greatest military and political characters that Europe had to boast of; and where State Councils were holden with a splendour and magnificence becoming the dignity of assemblies, in whose decisions many nations felt themselves highly interested : like the Castle, the ancient City of Roxburgh, once the first of Scotland for opulence and magnificence, has decayed ; and the plough has now almost obliterated the few remains of streets and houses, which were visible within the last century. The Site of the Castle, and the precincts of Old Roxburgh, are now included in the Parish of Kelso. See, Kelso, and James's, St.\u2014 About two miles West from the Castle, 4H2"], [620, "R O X stands the present ViHage of Roxburgh, pleasantly situate near the banks ofthe Teviot, on a declivity, with a fine Southern aspect. It is divided by a small rivulet into The Upper aud Nether Towns, which were formerly of considerable extent : Here is the Church, which is nearly central to the whole Parish. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks Scotch, and a darg of turf cast on Roxburgh moor, according to ancient custom, together with several small perquisites. Besides the Parochial, there are two other Schools in this Parish, for the accom modation ofthe children who live at a distance from the Village : the Salary of the masters being paid by their employers. A small purple-coloured trout abounds here, which is ofa delicious flavour, and is said to be peculiar to the river Teviot; salmon, and various kinds of fish, are also abundant in the Teviot, and Tweed. Game is in plenty. In almost every part of this Parish, the eye is presented with objects that Nature and Art seem vying how best to adorn : but the beauty of the scenery around the scite of the ancient City of Roxburgh, is particularly admired. In the Minister's garden, is a Hawthorn-tree, remarkable for its size and beauty, measuring about 7 feet in circumference, and shading an area of upwards of 30 feet in diameter : and, when in blossom, is a most pleasing object. On the banks of the Tweed, are two springs of a petrifying quality. On the summit of a bank gently sloping down to the Teviot, are the remains of a strong Tower, by some called Merlin's Cave, and by others Wallace's Tower: it was inhabited within the memory of some old persons, who speak with rap ture ofthe fine gardens, fruit-trees, and various decorations, with which it was surrounded. A little to the westward of this Tower, on the opposite side of the river, are several Caves cut out ofthe solid rock, in the middle ofa high preci pice, whose base is washed by the Teviot, which flows here broad and deep in a serpentine form : three of these Caves have been of large dimensions : one of them was used as a hiding-place for horses in 1745, when The Pretender went through this Parish with his army ; and, from that circumstance, as well as from its having been used for a stable afterwards, it is called Tlie Horse Cave; another is called The Dove Cave, from its having been used by Lady Chatto, as a Pigeon-house. There are many vestiges of ancient camps, and trenches ; but the most remarkable encampment, is that on the North-West side, usually said to be in Maxton Parish, but from the local memory of the Inhabitants, it is in that of Roxburgh. The exploratory Mount which belongs to this Camp, stands a little Eastward on the banks of the Ticeed, and is planted on the top with trees, as a vista from Makerston House, and makes a very picturesque appear-"], [621, "RUM ance, the scenery round its base being highly romantic. A Well, of several streams, issues out of it: which, from its name, St. John's Well, the peculiar salubrity ofthe water, and the remains ofa neat building, was in all probability once in great repute. The great Roman Road, Watling Street, from Borough bridge in Yorkshire, to the Lothians, runs through the West corner of the Parish ; and, it is Worthy of remark, that that ancient Road being still thought the nearest between England and Scotland, great numbers of Cattle purchased at the Scotch markets, are carried to the Southward this way. The Castle of Old Roxburgh, which gave its name to the Shire, stood in the Latitude of 55\u00b0..36'..35\" North, and in the Longitude of 2\u00b0..29'..15\" West from Greenwich. Roxburgh gives the title of Duke, and also of Earl, to the Ancient and Illus trious family of Kerr. ROXBURGH, SHIRE, or TEVIOT-DALE. This Shire is about 40 miles in length, and 36 miles in breadth, and contains 472,320 square acres, English measure : running along the English border for the space of about 60 miles. The general appearance, upon the whole, is a beautiful succession of hills and dales ; and the soil is in many parts rich, and well cultivated. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 33,682, and, in 1811, was 37,230. It sends one Member to Parliament. RUCH-HILL, v. LAMB-HILL. RUE-CASTLE, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Bedrule. It is a small Village, situate on elevated ground, at the distance of 2 m. W. S. W. from Jedburgh. This is considered to be a place of great antiquity ; and, however unlikely from its present appearance, it is said, that the Courts of Justice were originally holden here, and afterwards removed to Jedburgh. RUGLEN, v. RUTHERGLEN. RULLION GREEN, v. GLENCROSS. RUM, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Argyle : it con stitutes part ofthe Parish of Small Isles. It is 16 miles nearly North from the harbour of Eigg ; from whence the Minister performs Divine Service once a month here in the open air, as the Church is in ruins. This Island is nearly a square of 8 miles, containing upwards of 22,000 acres. It is mountainous, rugged, and barren. In the hills there are red deer. The horses are very small, but ofa breed eminent for beauty. The Resident Population of this Island, in 1796, was 443, and, in 1811, was 535. Loch Skresort or Sgriosard, on the"], [622, "RUS Eastern coast, is the only Harbour : it is spacious, and easy of access, with good anchorage in 5 and 7 fathoms water. At the bottom of the Bay, is the little Village of Kinloch. It is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0 3' 45\" North, and the Longitude of 6\"J 24' 52\" West from Greenwich. It originally belonged to Clanranald, but was purchased by Maclean, of Coll; who, in some dispute about the bargain, made Clanranald prisoner, and kept him nine months in confinement. The in habitants, according to Dr. Johnson, \" continued Papists for some time after the Laird became a Protestant. Their adherence to their old religion was strengthened by the countenance of the Laird's sister, a zealous Romanist, till one Sunday as they were going to Mass under the conduct of their Patroness, Maclean met them on the way, gave one of them a blow on the head with a yellow stick, I suppose a Cane, for which the Earse had no name, and drove them to the Kirk, from which they have never since departed. Since the use of this method of conversion, the inhabitants of Eigg, and Canna, who continue Papists, call the Protestantism of Rum, the religion ofthe Yellow Stick.\" \u2014 It lies between the Isles of Eigg and Canna, and is about 7 miles N. N.W. from Eigg, and 4 from Canna. It is altogether mountainous : and in short, it may be reck oned a groupe of mountains, of which Aisgobhall is the highest. Its shores are in general very bold and rocky, and often present tremendous perpendicular pre cipices. Loch Skresort, which is the only harbour in the Island, is about two miles long, and is bounded on both sides by hills of considerable height, which rise pretty rapidly from the sides ofthe Loch. The strata upon both sides are of red-coloured sandstone. At Kinloch, the small Village at the head ofthe Loch, the land is low and continues pretty much so, to the shore opposite to the Island of Canna, forming a kind of valley which is bounded by lofty hills, that are more rugged upon the South than the North side. The bottom of this valley is ele vated in the middle ; and here we observe another valley, which runs quite in a contrary direction. RUMBLETON, and RUMBLETON-LAW, v. GORDON. RUSCO, TOWER, v. ANWOTH.

See, Maxton. RUTHERGLEN, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Under Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, before the late augmentation, was 55 bolls of oats, 34 bolls of barley, and 56 bolls 14| pecks of oat-meal: the manse was re-built, in 1781, but is now ruinous : the glebe consists of 4| acres : Patrons, The Magistrates and Council, the Heritors residing within the Borough, and Thirteen Poundiand thereof, the Members ofthe Kirk Session, and the Tenants of Shaicfield, jointly : The ancient Church was taken down in 1794, and a new one erected. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2437, and, in 1811, was 3529. It is 2\\ m. S. S. E. from Glasgow. The Tuesday Market is now disused. The Fairs are holden on the first Friday, O. S., in March, the last Friday, O. S., in April, the first Tuesday after Trinity Sunday, the third Friday, O. S., in July, the third Friday, O. S., in August, the third Monday, O. S., in October, and which lasts the whole week, and the third Friday, O. S., in November. This is a very ancient Town, pleasantly situate near the Southern bank ofthe Clyde. It acquired a considerable degree of influence, from the share which it had in the management of Political affairs ; and has, for some centuries, been the Head Burgh of the Under Ward of Clydes-Dale or Shire of Lanark ; and all the Edicts in the Parishes of Bothwell, Bertram-Shotts, Cambus-Netham, Glasford, Strath-Avon, Blantyre, Cambus-Lang, and Carmunnock, are served at its Cross. It was erected into a Royal Borough by King David the First, in 1126 ; and is governed by a Provost, Baillies, and Counsellors. The Set ofthe Burgh is upon the most liberal principles. Rutherglen, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Glasgow, Renfrew, and Dumbarton, sends one Member to Parlia-"], [624, "RUT ment. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites. The Castle, celebrated for its sieges during the trouble some age of Robert Bruce, was kept in good repair, till a short time after the battle of Langside, when it was burned by orders of The Regent, out of revenge on the family of Hamilton, in whose custody it then was : one of the principal Towers was, however, soon repaired, and, being enlarged by some modern im provements, became the seat of the Hamiltons, of Elistoun, Lairds of Shaufield; but, on the decline of that family, it was permitted to fall into ruins, and, by frequent dilapidations, was soon levelled with the ground. The Parish of Ru therglen is about 3 miles in length, and a mile and a quarter in breadth, stretch ing along the Southern bank of the river Clyde. The surface is beautifully diversified with a regular succession of small hills, and narrow dales, except near the river, where it extends into some very delightful and fertile plains : the whole is inclosed, and well cultivated. The beautiful Mansions of Shawfield, Farme, Hamilton Farm, and Rosebank, with their extensive Policies, add greatly to its fertile appearance. Coals, free-stone, and iron-stone, are in abundance, and of the best quality. The Roads, and Bridges, are in excellent repair. The only Mill in the Parish is the Town's Mill, to which all the Borough lands are astricted, at the thirlage ofthe Fortieth part of the grana crescentia, seed and horse corn excepted: the Miller is entitled to half a peck for bannock-meal, out of every six firlots, which are ground at the mill ; and the Multurer, or Miller's servant, has in addition what is equal to one-half of the bannock-meal for his fee. Rutherglen gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Douglas, Earl of March. RUTHVEN, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 52 bolls of victual : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of upwards of 20 acres, part of which is good soil, pleasantly situate on the West bank ofthe river Isla: Patron, The Crown ; but the Minister is Titular ofthe Tythes by a gift in the year 1634, from The Marquis of Hamilton, then Proprietor ofthe Abbey Lands, to Mr. Patrick Crichton, Minister of Ruthveu, and his successors in office : The Church is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Meigle, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 211, and, in 1811, was 240. It is 3 m. E. from Alyth. This Parish contains about 1700 acres, pleasantly situate on the North side of the vale of Strathmore, near the foot of the Grampian Mountains : the soil is, in general, alight hazel mould, on a gravelly bottom, and is, in wet seasons,"], [625, "RUT most productive: agriculture has lately been much improved here. It is watered by the River Isla, which, in its passage, forms some remarkable cas cades. Fuel is scarce. Here is a shell marl, of a very fine quality. There are upwards of 300 acres covered with wood. There is an excellent free-stone Quarry. On the South-West side ofthe Parish is an ancient fortification, called Castle Dykes, but of which tradition gives no account : the North part is said to have been the scene of an engagement between the English and Scotch forces, under King Edward the First and Robert Bruce. The excellent modern House of Isla-Bank, to which new wings have lately been added, is built near the much admired situation of the Castle of Ruthven, which, being ruinous, was pulled down some years ago ; it is the residence of the truly respectable family of Ogilvie, who is Proprietor of both the Baronies of Earl's Ruthven, and Ruthven' s Davy. RUTHVEN, CASTLE, v. T1BBERMUIR. RUTH WELL, or RUTHWALD, anciently RYVAL, in the Shire of Dum- fries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. Sterling, paid in money: the manse is large, and commodious: the glebe consists of 36 acres : Patron, The Earl of Mansfield : The Church is an ancient Fabric ; it is a long building, remarkably narrow, and has a projecting Aisle attached to it, which was formerly the Burial-place of the Murrays, of Cockpool, and is now that of the family of Mansfield. It is in the Presbytery of Annan, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 996, and, in 1811, was 1184. It is 5-f m. W. b. N. from Annan. The Village of Ruth- well has lately been re-built, in a neat and regular manner, at the expense of Viscount Stormont, who is the principal Proprietor ofthe Parish : It is a Burgh of Barony, and is privileged to hold Markets, and Fairs. Here is a good Gram- mar School, with the legal Salary of 300 merks Scotch, and perquisites: the Master admits Borders. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern shore of the Solway Firth. The soil, though in some places shallow and inclined to sand, is, in general, when pro- perly cultivated, sufficiently fertile ; and, as the exposure is finely open to the South, the crops are early. The sea has rather receded from the Scotch side of the Firth of late years, and the tides do not rise to the same height which they did formerly, so that the land has gained considerably, and large tracts of green merse now appear, where the tides flowed over a surface of sand. At the mouth ofthe river Lochar there is a small Port, where barks and little coasting vessels vol. ii. 4 1"], [626, "RUT load, and deliver coals and grain. The climate is racist, but not unhealthy. At Brow, within the tidemark, is a chalybeate spring, which is much resorted to in the Summer months for the benefit ofthe water, and sea-bathing. Great quan tities of coarse brown Salt are annually made upon the coast; and which, in consequence of an exemption or grant by James the Sixth, was duty free, until the Union. The great Road, from Carlisle to Port-Patrick, which was made by the Military at the expense of Government, runs through the Parish from East to West: and, in consequence of an Act of Parliament afterwards passed, another road has been made to the Northward, which runs almost parallel to the Military Road, and shortens the distance between Annan and Dumfries, some thing more than a mile; tolls are levied upon both of these roads. Near Com longan are very extensive lime Quarries, ofa superior quality. Fish, of various kinds, are abundant in the Firth. Coals are imported at a reasonable expense, from the opposite coast of Cumberland. Comlongan Castle, now the Seat of Viscount Stormont, created Earl of Mansfield in 1792, was, for many ages, the residence of the Murrays, of Cockpool, a family of great power and em inence in Annandale ; some of them having been Wardens of the Western Bor der, and Cuthbert Murray, of Cockpool, was one of the Commanders of the Scotch army, which defeated The Duke of Albany and The Earl of Douglas, when they invaded Scotland in 1483. John Murray, a younger son of this family, having acquired a great estate, as well in Scotland as in England and Ireland, was created by James the Sixth, Earl of Annandale: he afterwards succeeded to the Family estate, and resided in the Castle of Comlongan ; but the title became extinct upon the death of his son without children, in 1658, when Viscount Stormont, the legitimate Heir, became Proprietor ofa consider able part ofthe estate. His Lordship's Grandfather, the father ofthe first Earl of Mansfield, resided here many years ; and, for his accommodation, made vari ous additions to the Castle, which are now possessed by his Factor. There are also the remains of an old Castle at Cockpool, within half a mile of Comlongan, which was likewise a Seat of the Family. In the Church-yard, are the fragments of an ancient Obelisk, which appears to have been 18 feet high, and is ornamented with Scriptural histories, and Runick Characters. Tradition says, that this Obelisk was, in remote ages, set up at a place, called Priestwood, near the sea, in order to assist the vulgar, by sensible images, to form some notions of Reli gion, but was drawn from thence by a teem of oxen belonging to a Widow, and placed in the Church-yard, where it remained 'till the Reformation ; when, by"], [627, "SAD an Act ofthe General Assembly in 1644, it was ordered to be thrown down and broken, as a remnant of Idolatry. This piece of Antiquity has been often visited by the curious, and a description and view of it is given in Mr. Gordon's Itinera rium Septentrionale, p. 160. pi. 58, and in Mr. Pennant's Tour vol. 2. p. 96. It appears by ancient records that, at a place called Kirk Style, there was formerly aPreceptory belonging to the Knights of St. John, where they had a place of Worship and a Burying-ground, and that they were also possessed of property to a great extent in the neighbourhood ; which, upon the Suppression of that Order, came into the possession of the Murrays, of Cockpool: Some tomb stones are still to be seen in the Parish Church-yard, on which the Insignia and Arms ofthe Order are engraven.

It is in the Presbytery of Cantyre, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population ofthe Parish of Saddale, in 1801, was 799, and, in 1811, was 819. It is 14 m. N. b. E. from 412"], [628, "SAL Campbell-Town. The United Parishes are about 25 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The surface is uneven ; but, along the sea coast, and in the glens, there are considerable fields of arable land, of a good soil, and tolerably fertile : the hills are appropriated to pasturage. There are 94 merk-lands in the Parish. The roads are in good repair ; but several bridges are still much wanted over the dangerous and rapid rivers. The fisheries are prosecuted here with great success. Fuel is expensive. The climate is very rainy. The Abbey of Saddale, now in ruins, appears to have been a large building, in the form of a cross : it was begun by Somerled, Lord of Cantyre and The Isles, in 1160, and finished by his son Reginald, for monks of the Cistertian Order. Upon almost every point of land along the coast, are the remains of small Danish forts ; the most considerable of which, is The Aird of Caradell, upon a high preci pitous rock, 240 feet in length, and 72 feet in breadth: and near this, at the extremity ofthe Promontory, which forms the sine Bay of Caradell, is a small Island, with a vitrified fort upon it.

The Village itself is delightfully situate at the extre mity of Saline Hill, and consists of a number of Houses, mostly detached, with gardens, interspersed with Forest trees : and it is esteemed one ofthe most rural and picturesque Villages in the County. It is 6 m. N. W. from Dunfermlin. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth. Towards the North and East it is hilly ; but the Western part is level, and the land near the Village is very fertile. Coals are abundant, but are not much worked, by reason"], [629, "SAL of the vicinity to the Pits of Blairingone. The extensive Lime-works of Rescobie, and Lathalmond, are at the extremity ofthe Parish ; to which there is good access bya new Turnpike road, that has been productive of great improve ment to a considerable tract of country, formerly uncultivated, through which it passes. The High-road from Dunfermlin to Auchterarder also passes through this Parish. The Castle of Killerny, now in ruins, is said to have belonged to the ScoTs/of Balweary, and some fabulous stories are related concerning it. The Kirkland Tower, also in ruins, is situate on part ofthe lands formerly belonging to the Bishop of Dunkeld, which still bear the name of the Kirk lands. The property in this Parish is pretty equally divided among a number of Heritors, most of whom are resident, and cultivate their own estates. The ancient game of Curling is still a favourite diversion here, and a Club of neighbouring Gentle men and Farmers, called Tlie Ice Club, have frequent meetings at the Village during the Winter season. Upon Bandrum Hill some Roman urns have been discovered, which indicate the former existence ofa military station. The prin cipal Residences are, Upper Kinnedder, Nether Kinnedder, Bandrum, Balgonar, Hillside, Tunnygask, Grey Craigs, West Saline, Rhynds, and Tullohill. SALISBURY CRAIGS, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of Canongate. This is a remarkable Rock, which lies on the East side ofthe City of Edinburgh, being part ofthe Hill of Arthur s Seat. It is noted chiefly for its steep precipitous front of solid rock, which it presents on the West side towards the City, in the form of an Amphitheatre ; the summit of which is 550 feet in height. And it is interesting to the Naturalist, from the materials of which it is composed, and the arrangement ofthe strata. SALLOCHY, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Buchanan. It is situate on the banks of Loch Lomond, at the distance of 7 miles North-West from Drymen. Here the Society School is kept three years, alternately with Inver Snaid. SALTCOATS, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : partly in the Parish of Ardrossan, and partly in the Parish of Steven ston. It is 6 m. W. from Irvine. This is a flourishing Town, pleasantly situate on the Atlantic Ocean, and is a well frequented Sea-bathing place. The Harbour, which was erected by the patriotic exertions of the late Sir Robert Cuninghame, Bart., will admit vessels of 220 tons burden. A shore Bailiff levies the small anchorage dues, and carries into execution such regulations as are necessary for the loading and sailing of the vessels. Great quantities of coals, and salt, are- exported"], [630, "SAL from hence; and of late, the trade of ship-building has been carried on with success. SALTERNESS, or SOUTHERN-NESS, in the Stewartry of Kirkcud bright ; and in the Parish of Kirkbeau. It is 15 m. S. from Dumfries. This Village is situate close upon the shore of the Solway Firth ; and was built by the late Richard Oswald, Esq., of Auchencruive, with the view, it is said, of a coal trade : but a trial for coal having been made in its neighbourhood, it was not attended with success. It is now chiefly inhabited by persons who furnish accommodations for those who resort to it, for the benefit of Sea-bathing. Upon this Ness, or Point of land, a Tower is erected as a Landmark for vessels in the coasting trade, and which might be rendered of still greater advantage, if lights were placed in it. Vessels often come to an anchor in the bay, in 3 or 4 fathoms, at low water. Lime-stone is abundant in the neighbourhood. SALTON, in the Shire of Hadington : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a340..5..6\u00a3 in money, 1 chalder of wheat, 1 chalder of barley, 6 bolls of oats, and about 27 bolls of oat-meal, a large old manse built in 1659, and a glebe of nearly 5 acres of excellent land : Patron, General Fletcher : The Church, which is situate at East Salton, is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting of East and West Salton) was 768, and, in 1811, was 790. It is 5 m. SW. b. S. from Hadington. In the village of East Salton, is an excellent weekly Market, for Butcher's meat. It is in the vicinity also of good coals, which are sold uncommonly cheap. The water is particularly fine, and the climate is dry, and extremely healthy. This Parish contains upwards of 2000 acres : it is bounded on the West by the rivers Salton and Tyne, which here unite, and separate it from that of Pencaitland : from the banks ofthe rivers the land rises by a gentle ascent to the South- East, exhibiting a rich, regular, and well cultivated surface : the soil is of great variety ; loam, light sand, clayey loam, and deep rich clay ; of which, however, the latter is the most prevalent. Here are several quarries of excellent free-stone ; limestone also is abundant. In the beginning ofthe Seventeenth century, the art of making pot barley, and of weaving that particular kind of linen cloth called Hollands, was introduced into this Parish, and exclusively practised, to the great emolu ment ofthe inhabitants, who, for several years, supplied the whole of Scotland with these important articles. The introduction of these arts was owing to the patriotism ofthe Lady of Henry Fletcher, of Salton ; who, animated with the"], [631, "SAM desire to increase the manufactures of her country, travelled into Holland with two expert, mechanics, disguised as her servants ; and visiting the work-houses, to which her rank procured her easy access, the mechanics got models of the machinery, and the secrets ofthe manufacture. About the year 1750, the first Bleachfield of The British Linen Company was established in this place, under the patronage of Lord Milton: But of these several branches of manufacture there are now no remains, except a small Bleach-field, a Starch-work, and a Paper-Mill. Salton Hall, the Seat of General Fletcher, was formerly a place of considerable strength, being regularly fortified : it has been much ornamented by the present most worthy Proprietor, who has an excellent Library : and the Lawn in front is, perhaps, the finest in Scotland, commanding a rich and exten- sive prospect : this Estate has been in possession of tbe Fletchers ever since the year 1643, having been then purchased by Sir Andrew Fletcher of Lord Abernethy, whose family had been proprietors of it so long as from the year 1249. Herdmanston, the property of Lord Sinclair, is also an ancient and forti- fied building, and has been for centuries in the possession of that great Baronial family. This Parish has had the honour of giving birth, or affording residence to many distinguished characters. William Dunbar, often named the Scottish Horace, was born here in the year 1465 : in the earlier period of his life, he was a Friar : but he soon relinquished the profession of a Monk, for that of a Poet t \" The Golden Terge,\" and \" The Thistle and The Rose,\" are the most admired productions of his muse ! \u2014 At the Restoration, the Cure of Salton was served by Patrick Scougal, the celebrated Bishop of Aberdeen. \u2014 He was succeeded by Gilbert Burnet, a not less famous character, who acquired, in 1665, his first preferment in the Church from Sir Robert Fletcher, the Patron hereof; and from hence, in 1669, he-was invited to the Divinity Chair in Glasgow : adjacent to the Minister's manse, is a Tree, which is called \" Bishop Burnet s Tree .-\" his legacies to Salton have proved highly beneficial to the Parishioners. \u2014 The celebrated Andrew Fletcher, the patriotic and independent Statesman, was born in this Parish, and was for some years the Pupil of Burnet. \u2014 And lastly, it was the place of nativity of one, whose virtues and patriotism stand unrivalled, Lord Milton, who held the office of Lord Justice Clerk, during the Rebellion of 1745, and to whom his country was so much indebted during that turbulent crisis. The great family of Morville had of old extensive jurisdiction here. SALT PRESTON, v. PRESTON PANS. SAMPSON, one of The Scilly Islands. This Island is estimated to contain"], [632, "SAN 120 acres ; and its Resident Population, in 1810, was 35. It is H m. W\\ from St. Mary's. SAND, CHAPEL, v. GAIRLOCH. SANDA, ISLAND, off the Coast of Argyle ; and in the Parish of South end. It is about a league to the Southward of the Peninsula of Cantyre, the Sound between which abounds with a variety of fish. This Island is about a mile and a half in length, and half a mile in breadth, and is famed for having been the place of rendezvous for the Danish fleets, during their expeditions to the Western coasts : from which circumstance it received the appellation of Avona Porticosa, and is still sometimes called Avon. Here are the remains of an old Chapel, dedicated to St. Columba. And, in Fordun's time, here was the Chapel of St. Annian, and a Sanctuary for the refuge of criminals. This is a lofty Island, and is inhabited by four families. About two miles to the East ward, is a dangerous rock, called Peterson's or Sunk Rock, which is much dreaded by mariners. SANDA Y, ISLAND, one ofthe Orkneys: in which are the Parishes of Burness, Cross Kirk, and Lady Kirk : the United Vicarages of Burness, and Cross-Kirk, are annexed to the Vicarage of North Ronaldsay : the Vicarage of Lady Kirk is holden separately : Patron, Lord Dundas. It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of these Parishes was, In 1801. In 1811. Burness - - 370. 423. Cross Kirk - - 548. 512. Lady Kirk - - 830. 862. 1748. 1797. This Island is twelve miles in length, varying in breadth from one mile or less in some places, to two or three miles in others. Its form is very irregular, hav ing many extended points, with bays running a considerable way inland. The surface is low, and flat, particularly on the East Coast ; which, not only renders their approach dangerous to mariners, but subjects the Island to inundation from a Spring tide, with a gale of Easterly wind. The soil is almost every where mixed with sand, and, in many places, is entirely sand, but when well manured with sea-ware, produces tolerable crops, and is accounted the Granary of Orkney. It is separated from North Ronaldsay by a channel from one to two"], [633, "SAN and a half leagues wide. The air is rather moist, and raw, but not unhealthy. The two principal Harbours are, Kettletofit on the South side, and Otterswick on the North side, both of them pretty safe, and of sufficient depth of water, and good anchoring ground. The great disadvantage under which this Island labours, is the scarcity of fuel. There is a School in the Parish of Lady Kirk, the master of which is paid by a mortification for this purpose : the intention of the donor, it is said, was, that he should teach the children upon one estate only: the School is placed on that estate, at the extremity ofthe Parish, where he has a School-house, and his Scholars are mostly from the estate from which he is paid, but he does not refuse those who chuse to come to him from any other part of the Parish : he has no School-fees, and his yearly Salary as paid from this estate, is 9 meils of bear or bigg, 4 settings of oat-meal, and 12 merks of butter. the whole being about \u00a32. or \u00a32..5..0. Sterling. The coast abounds with a variety offish ; and the shores produce nearly a fourth part of the whole quantity of kelp manufactured in Orkney. The rock of Hecla-Bor consists ofa sandstone breccia, most of the component pieces of which are rounded and water- worn nodules of sand-stone, with a few quartz and calcareous nodules interspersed : this rock has been considered as volcanic. The House of Scarr, is the Seat of Mr. Traill, of Westove, who resides on his property, and is laudably engaged in inclosing, draining, and other substantial improvements ; and where he has a mostextensive and well-chosen Library, the certain mark of an enlightened mind. The old House of Stove is finely situate at the head of a sandy Bay, the whole of which is one continued cockle-bed : it was formerly the property of the ancient family of Fea, who were also holders of the same property and title, Clestron; this ancient family, however, is now nearly extinct : the estate has beeome the property of Malcolm Laing, Esq., Author of\" The History of Scotland,\" in two volumes Octavo, 1800 : a work, which, according to the honourable testimony ofthe late celebrated Statesman Charles Fox, has \" cleared up much more of English History than any other of those historians who have professedly treated of it.\" At a little distance from the house, are the ruins ofa neat little Chapel, which are apparently considered as a legitimate Quarry by the tenants, and cottars around : as the Family burying-place, however, it ought to remain inviolate. . SANDEND, in the Shire of Banff ; and in the Parish of Fordyce. It is 2 ra. W. from Portsoy. This is an improving Fishing Village, situate at the bottom of a Bay ofthe same name, on the Moray Firth. vol. ii. 4 K"], [634, "SAN SANDERAY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Barray, from which it is 5 mijes distant, to the Southward. It is 2 miles in length, and the same in breadth, and contains 9 families. Here is one of the Danish Duns. SANDILAND, ISLAND, v.' INCH KENNETH. SAND ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Argyle. It con stitutes the North side ofthe Harbour of Canna, from which Island it is separ ated by a Strait, that is left nearly dry at every ebbing ofthe tide. It is low, and consists of rocks of trap formation. The end, which forms the entrance of the harbour, is of basalt tuff, having basalt pillars resting upon it. This is a small, but valuable Island ; and is fit, both for pasture, and cultivation. It is inhabited by four families, who rent the whole of it. SAND-NESS, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland: formerly a Vicarage, constituting part of the Union of Walls : The Church was built, in 1792 ; it is six miles distant from the Church of Walls, and Divine Service is performed here only once a month. A Charity School has been estab lished here, with a legal Salary of \u00a310. Sterling per annum. See, Walls. SANDS, v. TULLIALLAN. SANDSIDE, v. ANDREW'S, ST SANDSIDE BAY, v. REAY. SANDSTING, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Vicarage of Aithsting annexed ; the Sti pend of which, in 1811, in lieu ofthe whole Teinds, was \u00a393.. 10.. 9., including the sum of \u00a32..10..0. for Communion elements ; the manse was built in 1770, and was repaired in 1788 : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church was built in 1780, and was new roofed in 1789. It is in the Presbytery of Shetland, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801, was 1493, and, in 1811, was 1617. The United Parishes are about 9 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth : there are 801 merks-land, but the extent of a merk-land is very indefinite. The appearance of the Parish is rather hilly : the cultivated ground is generally at the foot ofthe hills, and, on the sea-shore, and there is not a house in the Parish that is half a mile distant from the sea : on the West side ofthe Parish, the hills are generally green on a mossy soil, and affording little pasture for sheep or horses in winter : on the North, the hills are dry and rocky, with slender long heather, and fine sweet grass: in the middle, the hills are deep moss, and afford plenty of coarse grass called Lubbo, and short bushy heather :"], [635, "SAN the soil is in a few places sandy; in some it is clay ; but, in general, it is deep black moss. Agriculture is little understood here. This Parish is every where intersected by long narrow Voes or Firths : and the small part of it which is bounded by the Ocean, is a very high and rocky shore ; where some curious caves, formed by the Western billows, are much frequented by seals, and wild fowls. The air is moist and foggy, but not unhealthy. Although there is no convenient fishing station here, nor any beaches fit for drying the fish, the fisheries are nevertheless carried on with great vigour by the inhabitants, who are not inferior in skill and activity to any of their neighbours. There are no roads in the Parish; and, in many places, it is not possible to make them, the hills being so rugged, and the moss so deep. There are no stated Ferry-boats at the Voes ; but the inhabitants are ever ready to assist and forward their neighbours, often for nothing, and at most for a very small reward. There are numerous fine Bays and Harbours, which are of little consequence here, as a Ship has scarcely been seen in some of them within the memory of man. A number of young men from this Parish engage annually with the Greenland ships for the season, and are landed again in the Autumn. Some farms have been split, and a part ofthe Commonties have been improved, since the year 1801, with a view to increase the number of Fishermen. SANDWICK, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, now constituting part of the Union of Dunross-Ness. Here is a commodious Harbour for small Vessels. See, Dunross-Ness. SANDWICK, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Stromness : on the old Church of Sandwick becoming ruinous, and which was dedicated to St. Peter; it was re-built in 1670, by Andrew Honeyman, Bishop of Orkney ; and again, in 1767. It is in the Presbytery of Cairston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 970, and, in 1811, was 967. It is adjacent to the Parish of Stromness, on the North. On the West side of the Parish of Sandwick, near the Sandy Bay, is an extensive Rabbit Warren. Here is a female School. The Roads through this Parish are natur ally good, as the ground is firm and dry. The ancient abode of Thorkel is utterly destroyed. Here are several Tumuli; one of which, in The Links of Skail, was opened by The Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., K. B., on his return from Iceland, in 1772, assisted by The Rev. George Low ; anda description of its contents, together with a plate, is inserted in the Third Volume ofthe Transaction* 4K2"], [636, "SAN of The Society of Antiquaries of London, p. 276. In a part of the Parish of Sandwick, every family who has a herd of Swine, kills a Soic on the 17th day of December, from whence it is called Sow-day: there is no tradition, as to the origin of this custom. In the same place, the inhabitants do not work on the 3d day of March, in commemoration of the day on which the Church of Sandwick was consecrated ; and, as the Church was dedicated to St. Peter, they also ab stain from working/or themselves on St. Peter's day, the 29th of June, but they will work for any other person who may employ them. See, Stromness. SANDWICK, ISLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; situate to the Westward of Yell, and constituting part of that Parish. SANDY BAY, v. FAR. SANDY-HILLS, within the Jurisdiction of the City of Glasgow, and Shire of Lanark : in the Barony Parish. It is 3 m. E. from Glasgow. This is a po pulous Village. Here is a Cameronian Meeting, the descendants of the old Covenanters. SANDY KNOW, v. SMALL-HOLM. SANNOCKS, in the Isle of Arran, and Shire of Bute : in the Parish of Kill- Bride. This is a small Village, situate near a stream ofthe same name, on the North-East side ofthe Island. Near it is a low Monumental stone. SANQUHAR, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : the manse was built in 1755 : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The Church is very ancient, and in a ruinous condition^ It is in the Presbytery of Penpont, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Wanlock-Head ) was 2350, and, in 1811, was 2709. It is 56 m. S. S.W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Monday, O. S., in October, and the first Monday, O. S. in November. A General Post-Office is established here. It was erected into a Burgh of Barony in 1484; prior to which period, as the Charter implies, it had been a Burgh of the same kind, from time immemorial. At the instance of Robert Crichton, Lord of Sanquhar, it was erected into a Royalty, in 1596, by King James the Sixth. It is governed by a Provost, three Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and eleven Counsellors. Its Revenue, exclusive of an ex tensive, but wild and uncultivated Common, is about \u00a350. per annum. Sanquhar, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Annan, and Lochmaben, sends one Member to Parliament. It has long been famous"], [637, "SAN for its woollen manufactures. The Salary, and emoluments of the Parochial School, which is conducted by a very able Master, are about \u00a340. per annum: Besides which, there is a Private School, but without any fixed Salary. Coals are abundant. The Parish of Sanquhar is about 15 miles in length, and from 9 to 10 miles in breadth : the general appearance is rugged and mountainous, especially that lofty tract, which is known by the name of The Lowthers or Lothiers, rising with a gradual slope from the South to the elevation of 3000 feet above the level of the sea : these hills, though bleak and barren in the exterior, contain immense riches in their bowels ; and besides inexhaustible Quarries of lime-stone, the mines of coal, and lead, are worked to great advantage. Some ofthe Hills are partly green, and partly covered with heath, and are pastured with vast flocks of sheep : the soil, at the foot ofthe hills, is partly moss, and partly clay, affording only a scanty crop, and a late and precarious harvest : on the banks of the Nith, which intersects the Parish from the upper to the lower extremity, and is subject to inundations, the soil is deeper, and tolerably early and productive, when properly cultivated: but, the whole ofthe grain which is raised in the Parish, is not sufficient to supply the inhabitants one half of the year, as there are not, at an average, more than six or seven hundred acres under the plough. The climate is healthy. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. Game, of various kinds, are in abundance. The old Castle of Sanquhar , at a short distance South from the Burgh, was once the residence of the Family of Crichton, who were Heritable Sheriffs of Nith's-dale: It is said to have been for some time in possession of the English in the reign of Edward the First, and to have been re-captured by Sir William Douglas, of Douglas-dale, who put the garrison to the sword. The whole Barony belonged to the Crichtons, but Sir William Douglas, of Drumlanrig, having a mortgage upon some part of it, purchased the estate and castle, and, in 1630, obtained a Charter under the Great Seal of Scotland for the same ; in which great Family this Castle and Barony still remain, being the property of The Marquis of Queensberry. This Castle was the chief residence of the Family of Queensberry before William, the first Duke, built the Noble mansion of Drumlanrig , in which he only slept one night ; for, being taken ill, and not able to make any of his attendants hear him, or come to his assistance, he retired in disgust from it, to his Castle at Sanquhar, where he continued to reside the remainder of his life : his son not having the same predilection for this Castle, it was neglected, and suffered to be strips of its leaden roof, and its materials torn down for other buildings ; so"], [638, "S A R that in a few years, not a trace of its former magnificence will remain : Mr. Grose has preserved two Views of it. Prior to this Castle being in possession of the Crichtons, it belonged to the family of Ross, of Ryehill, cadets of the ancient and powerful Earls of Ross, Lords of the Isles of Scotland: Robert de Ross was the last of this ancient Line ; whose daughter and co-hciress, Isabel de Ross, married William the second son, of Thomas, Lord of Crichton, who flourished in the reign of King Robert Bruce. Near the residence ofthe Rosses, there appears to have been a large pile of building, which was probably The Hospital of Senewar ; as several stones of a Gothic figure are built into the walls and windows of the Houses, where this Edifice was erected ; there is also a large font ; and human bones have been discovered in digging and ploughing up the field in which it stands. About a mile from the Castle, is the House of Elliock, now the property of The Honourable James Veitch, one of the Senators of The College of Justice ; and which is noted as claiming the birth of James Crichton, well known by the proud distinction of, The Admirable Crichton. SANTON, in The Isle of Man : The Church is dedicated to St. Anne. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1792, was 512. It is 5 m. E. N. E. from Castle-Town, and about half a mile from the sea. Near this, are several stones placed somewhat in an oval form, which are probably of Druidical antiquity. SARCLETT, v. WICK. SARK, ISLAND, in The English Channel. It is situate off the Western coast of Normandy, between the Islands of Guernsey and Jersey, and is about 5 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. It is naturally a very strong place, inaccessible, except in one or two parts, where the ascent for carriages is so steep, that Philip Carteret, its Governor, cut a way through the cliff under ground, which is secured by a strong gate, and defended by cannon. Here are the remains of a Convent of St. Maglorius, Bishop of Dol, who first planted Christianity in these Islands about the year 565 : to this ancient House a pen sion was paid yearly out of the Exchequer, in the reign of Edward the Third. The French seized and kept possession of this Island until the time of Queen Mary ; after which it remained uninhabited. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Philip de Carteret, Lord of St. Ouen, undertook to plant such a Colony in it as should keep out the French, and his Heirs held it of the Crown by a small acknowledgement. It is well watered, and produces more corn than is sufficient for the consumption of its inhabitants, who are upwards of 300, and who are all tenants to the Lord of St. Ouen. The Isles of Jethou, and Ame, are very small,"], [639, "S C A andare only of consequence as sheltering the road of Guernsey: upon Arne, which is the largest of the two, was a solitary seat of Franciscan Friars. In 1719, an earthen pot, bound with an iron hoop, was discovered here, contain ing several Gaulish coins of silver gilt; and, in 1725, Mr. Vertue engraved a plate of eighteen of them. The Islands of Sark, aud Alderney, are under the same government with Guernsey. Sark abounds with rabbits, and wild-fowl; and, during the season of incubation, the cliff pigeons are in prodigious numbers. The only manufacture is that of knitting stockings,which they send to Guernsey; the chief employment is fishing. It is in the Diocese of Winchester. SARK-FOOT, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Graitney. This is a small Village, situate at the confluence ofthe river Sark with the Sol way Firth, and has a good Harbour, which admits vessels of 120 tons burden . In 1793, the value of the several Imports were \u00a310,190. ; and of the Exports \u00a37820. SARTHIE, v. FAR. SAUCHIE, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of St. Ninian. Here is the elegant Seat of The Honourable Major Hamilton. On the llth of June, 1488, The Field of Stirling, or the Battle of Sauchie-Burn, was fought on a tract of ground called Little Canglour, on the East side of a small Brook called Sauchie-Burn, about two miles South from Stirling, and about one mile West from the field of Bannock-Burn. SAUCHY, in the Shire of Clackmannan ; and partly in the Parishes of AJloa, and Clackmannan. It is 3 m. N. from Alloa. On this Estate, the property of Lord Cathcart, are such extensive and valuable seams of coal, lime-stone, and iron-ore, that, in 1792, some gentlemen were induced, under the Firm of The Devon Company, to establish iron works of considerable extent, on the banks ofthe Devon: and which have been attended with the greatest success. SAXAFORTH, v. UNST, ISLAND. SCALLOWAY, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shet land : it is in the Parish of Tingwall. It is 4 m. W. b. S. from Lerwick. This was formerly the Capital of Shetland, the Seat of Justice, and tlie occasional Residence of The Earls of Orkney and Zetland ; and is situate at the bottom of a fine valley. The Castle stands on the brink of an arm of the sea, which being protected from the rage of the Ocean by a number of little islands and holms, forms a safe natural harbour. The Town consists only of a few scattered houses in the neighbourhood ofthe Castle ; only one of which is in the modern"], [640, "S C A style, belonging to Mr. Scott, of Scalloway: around it, is a neat garden, in which are several small fruit and timber trees, and different shrubs, all of which are very rare in this part ofthe world. The Castle of Scalloway has been a very handsome Tower-House : it was built above two Centuries ago, by Earl Patrick Stewart, whose memory is holden in detestation by the natives, for his oppres sive exaction of services and contributions, during its erection: during the time of the Commonwealth, it was occupied as Barracks bya party of Cromwell's soldiers, to whom, it is said, the inhabitants were indebted for several improve ments, particularly the culture of cabbages. There is no Inn or Public House here ; but eggs, milk, and potatoes, may be procured in great plenty. The Vale from hence to Tingwall, is one ofthe most fertile in Shetland ; and in the pastures, is a good deal of natural clover, both red and white, though much in fested with the plant, called sneeze-wort, the achillea ptarmica. The whole valley has a bottom of rich primitive lime-stone, of a pale blue colour; which might easily be worked, as peat fuel is here abundant; there is also a bed of good marl. The only properly made road -in Shetland is from Lerwick to this place, and is the joint work of Mr. Ross, of Sound, and ofthe late Mr. Scott, of Scott's- Hall. SCALP A, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shet- land ; in the Parish of St. Ola. This is a small Village, situate about two miles South from Kirkwall. It gives name to a safe and commodious Bay, and is the usual place of landing from the Coast of Caithness. Scalpa Flow is a beautiful piece of water, being a small Mediterranean, of about 50 miles in circumference. It is surrounded with twelve different Islands, through which are several Out- lets to the Pentland Firth, the German, and Atlantic Oceans. This, particu- larly in time of war, is the great thoroughfare for ships coming North about. It abounds with safe Roadsteds, and fine Harbours ; such as Holm Sound, Floxa Sound, the Bay of Howton, St. Margaret's Houp, Pan Houp, and Long Houp in the Island of Walls ; where there is good anchorage, and a sufficient depth of water for the largest Ship in the British Navy. The principal entrance to Scalpa Flow, is through Holm Sound on the East, and Hoy-Mouth on the West. The Smacks employed throughout the season, in fishing and carrying lobsters to the London market, all rendezvous in one or other of the Harbours of Scalpa Flow. The tide, at its entrance, is uncommonly rapid, but it gradually sub sides, until it becomes scarcely perceptible. The course of the Flood, with a little variation, is from West to East : and, on one part of the Coast, where the"], [641, "S C A Current is intercepted by a reef of rocks, it runs nine hours in one direction, and three in the opposite one. Its banks offer, in fine weather, the most inviting walks to the inhabitants ofthe Town of Kirkwall. SCALPA, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Strath, from which it is distant about two-thirds ofa mile, to the Eastward. This is a high, bluff, Island, about 3 miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth ; and is inhabited. In the highest part of the Island, there is a petrified rock of moss, in which are varieties of shells : and in many other parts, throughout the higher districts, are great quantities of shells imbedded several feet beneath the surface. The shores are low, and are formed of blackish coloured argillaceous sandstone. It is the property of Lord Macdonald. SCALP AY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part of the Parish of Harris. This is a low, heath-covered, round Island, in the, entrance to East Loch Tarbert. Its land dimensions are not easily ascertained, its parts being scarcely coherent, from a singular intervention of water lakes and arms of the sea jutting in through it in various directions. Its two extreme points, from East to West, may be computed at 3 miles distant. On the East point is a Light-House, which was built in 1788 : and, near the Western extremity, are two of the best natural Harbours in the Hebrides : Mariners call it, The Isle of Glass. SCARABINE, MOUNTAIN, v. LATHERON. SCARBA, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the District of Islay, and Shire of Argyle : It constitutes part ofthe Parish of Jura, from which it is sepa rated by the much dreaded Sound called Corry-Vreckan. It is about 3 miles long, and nearly as broad, exceedingly rugged \"and mountainous ; and contains about 50 Inhabitants. It abounds with excellent slate. See, Jura, Island. SCARF-SKERRY, v. DUNNET. SCARINCHE, in the Isle of Lewis, and Shire of Ross. Here was a Mon* astery of Canons Regular, founded by the Macleods of The Lewis, in honour of St. Catan. . SCARP, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness: it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Harris. This is a high, round, rocky Island, one compact Mountain, of which the diameter at the base is about three miles. It is situate at the entrance of Loch Resort, and is divided from the Farm.of Jluskinish by a Sound, somewhat less than a mile broad at high water, vol ii. 4 L"], [642, "S C I SCARPA VERVECUM, v.

It is unin habited. SCHIEHALLION, MOUNTAIN, v. FORT1NGAL. It is in the Latitude of 56\u00b0 40' North. SCILLY ISLANDS. These are a cluster of Islands, situate at the Western entrance of The English Channel, and at the distance of 30 miles West- South- West from The Land's End, in Cornwall. Many of them are barren rocks ; only six of the largest being inhabited, the Resident Population of which, in 1810, was in St. Agnes, 230. Breyer, - - - 100. St. Martin's, 220. St. Mary's, - - 1200.1 7 _ The Garrison there, - 150. J Sampson, - 35. Tresco, 440. 2375. The vallies are fertile, and well inclosed : and the climate is particularly salu- brious. The coast abounds with fish, especially mackarel, pilchards, and ling. It is thought, that all these Islands anciently made but one ; the highest Head land of which, now called Scilly or Sylleh, i. e. Flat Rocks dedicated to the Sun, having some little Islands scattered round it, imparted its name to its inferiors, and which is now applied to the whole group. It is also conjectured, that they were once joined to the County of Cornwall, and that their separation was occa- sioned by a great inundation of the sea, at a very remote period. They were called by the Greeks, Hesperides and Cassiterides, from their Western situation, and from their abounding with tin: but Dr. Borlase infers, that the ancients included under the name of Cassiterides the Western part of Cornwall, for the quantity of tin found in the Isles is comparatively so little, that it was rather derived from Cornwall. Scilly Island consists only of one acre. The language spoken here, is a mixture ofthe West Country dialect, with the common Eng lish. The art of making kelp was introduced into these Islands by Mr. Nance,"], [643, "s c i in 1684. So early as the year 961, Scilly belonged to an Abbey of Benedictines then founded at Tavistock ; and these Islands were mostly governed by Lords, Abbots, and Coroners, from the time of their conquest by King \u00c6thelstan until the 30\u00b0 of Henry VIII., when the Abbey of Tavistock was dissolved, and they became subject to the Bishop of Exeter, in the same manner as they were to the Bishop of Cornwall, before the See was translated to Exeter. There is only one Clergyman in all the Islands, though provision for a Deacon or a School master has very piously and benevolently been made by the late Reverend Richard Corbet Hartshorne, Rector of Broseley, near Bridgenorth, in Shrop shire. In a record of Edward the Third, A. D. 1308, the Islands of Scilly are said to belong to the County of Cornwall; and in the 18D of Henry VI., they are stated to be holden of the King, as of his Castle of Launceston. But, when the County of Cornwall was erected into a Duchy, and granted to The King's Eldest son, in the 12\u00b0 of Edward III., the Islands of Scilly were not recited in the Grant. It has, therefore, been disputed whether they are a part of the Duchy, or not: Judge Dodderidge, however, reckons the Fee-farm of them among the Revenues of the Duke of Cornwall; and, Heath observes, that, on the Dissolution of Religious Houses, the Civil Power was granted by the Crown to Lords Proprietors, on condition of their paying certain rents into the hands of the receiver for the Duchy of Cornwall, for the tenure of those Islands ; by which they came to be acknowledged as part of the Jurisdiction of the said Duchy, but only by the King's favour, for it does not appear by any records, that they were ever annexed thereto. After passing through the families of Blanckminster, Colshull, Davers, Seymour, and Godalghan, they came by exchange to the Crown, in the reign of Queen Mary : but, in the 13\u00b0 of Elizabeth, they were granted by her to Francis Godolphin, to whose family, since enobled, they owe their present prosperity. The Court of Twelve assemble on the last Saturday of every Month, at the Court-House in Church-Town, St. Mary's, where Causes are heard and determined by authority delegated to Twelve persons, and a presiding Military Officer, as Magistrate, who direct the Government in all the Islands : except in cases of heresy, treason, murder, or offences on the sea, which last belong to the decision of the High Court of Admi ralty : Appeals may be made to The Lord Proprietor, in matters which are special. The inhabitants of Scilly, like those of Jersey, cannot be sued in any of the Courts of Westminster, for any matter or cause arising within the same. Felonies, and matters criminal committed here, are ordered to be tried at Laun ceston; and the culprits are to be sent over to that Prison, until the time of 4L2"], [644, "SCO trial : But the High Sheriff for the County of Cornwall has no authority in Scilly, except by permission of The Lord Proprietor. Constables, Overseers, and Church-wardens, are annually chosen to serve their respective offices in the five inhabited Islands, which are like so many distinct Parishes. They pay neither malt-tax, land-tax, nor excise ; and as there is no hereditary land in any of the Islands, (their lands being granted to them for the terra of 21 years only, and The Lord Proprietor repairing the houses) so no person has a vote there for choosing Members of Parliament, nor are they represented by any. The situ ation of these Islands is such, as renders them of great importance lo ship ping in general bound to the coast of England from the Southward, but es pecially to vessels bound either for St. Georges, or The English Channel : and they have recently been appointed a place of rendezvous by The Admiralty. The Light-House on St. Agnes is in the Latitude of 40\u00b0 53' 30\" North. On the night of the 22d of October 1707, Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovel was unfortunately lost upon the Gilston Rock, on his return from Toulon. SCOLSCRAY HOUSE, v. FERRY-PORT-ON-CRAIG. SCONCER, in the Isle of Skye, and in the Shire of Inverness ; it constitutes part of the Parish of Portree. It is 212 m. N. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here : and the great road from the Ferry at Kyle Rhea, the usual entrance into the Isle of Skye, to Dunvegan and Stein, made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, passes through it. Here is an excellent Inn. SCONE, or SCOON, in the Shire of Perth: formerly a Vicarage, the Sti pend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse was built in 1743: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent: Patron, The Earl of Mansfield ; The Church was built in 1784. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1670, and, in 181 1 , was 1953. It is 2 m. N. from Perth. This Parish contains about 4600 Scotch acres, principally inclosed and cultivated, Upon the banks of the Tay, the soil is a rich strong clay ; but in other places, it is partly light and gravelly, and partly a good loam. The air is particularly mild, and salubrious. Here are Quarries of excellent free-stone. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a good house, and garden. Coals are the chief fuel. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. At Stormont- Field, is an extensive Bleach-field. The Market Cross, formerly a handsome structure, is now much injured by time. Here are the vestiges ofa Roman Road : and, at Grassy Walls, is a large Roman Camp. Scone is noted for its Palace,"], [645, "SCO anciently the residence ofthe Scottish Kings, the place of their Coronation, and the scene of many splendid actions. Some writers call it the ancient Capital ofthe Picts ; but it certainly was the chief seat ofthe Princes of Scotland, as early as the time of Kenneth the Second, in 843. On a tumulus, still preserved, they kept their Courts of Justice ; on this they sat to determine the pleas bet ween their Barons, whence it was called the Mons Placiti de Scona, Omnis terra; or The Mote Hill of Scone \u2022 this Mount is also sometimes called Boot-Hill, in allusion to a supposed ancient practice of bringing to this place, a boot full of earth from different estates, when the Proprietors were assembled here to be invested in them. Upon this eminence, an elegant Parish Church was erected in 1624, by the first Viscount Stormont ; which, on wanting repairs, and being insufficient to accommodate the Parishioners, was lately taken down, except the Aisle, which is used as the Burial-place ofthe Ancient and Illustrious family of Mur ray; and contains asine marble monument to the memory of David, first Vis count Stormont, and an Urn of white marble of beautiful workmanship, inclos ing the embalmed heart of Lady Stormont, first wife of The Earl of Mansfield, with a remarkably elegant and pathetic Latin inscription. The Abbey was founded by Alexander the First, in 1114, and was dedicated to Tlie Holy Tri nity and St. Michael the Archangel, and filled with Canons Regular ofthe Order of St. Augustine : it is said to have been originally a Seat of the Culdees. In the Church of this Abbey was preserved the famous Stone, which was said to have served Jacob for his pillow! and afterwards transported to Spain, where it was used as a Seat of Justice by Gethalus a contemporary of Moses ! it after wards found its way to the Palace of Dunstaffnage, and continued there as the Coronation Chair, until Kenneth the Second removed it to Scone : here it re-: mained, and on it every Scottish Monarch was inaugurated till the year 1296, when Edward the First, to the mortification of North Britain, translated it to Westminster Abbey ; and with it, according to ancient prophecy, the empire of Scotland. The following Distich, according to the Editor of The Gazetteer, is said lo have been the cause of its removal, and to have reconciled many of the Scottish bigots to the Union : *** Ni fallat fatum, Scoti, quoeunque locatum, \" Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem. \" Unless old prophecies and wierds are vain, \" Where'er this stone is found, the Scots shall reign.\" And the prediction was considered as verified, when James the Sixth ascended"], [646, "SCO the English throne. This Abbey, together with the Church, in the year 1559, underwent the common fate of Religious houses, in the furious and ungovern able season of Reformation : being demolished by the zealots of Dundee, in re sentment of one of their company who was killed by a shot from the house. In 1604, it was erected into a Temporal Lordship by James the Sixth, in favour of Sir David Murray, a Cadet ofthe Illustrious family of Tullibardine. Charles the Second was crowned in this Church, before he set out in the expedition that terminated in the fatal battle of Worcester ; the Crown being placed on his head by The Marquis of Argyle. The ceremony of placing the new Monarch in the Coronation chair was Hereditary in the ancient Earls of Fife. In 1715, the old Chevalier resided at Scone for some time, and issued out six proclamations from thence ; among which was one for his Coronation on the 23d of January, 1716; but, before the period arrived, his resolution failed, and he fled from a Crown which he was unworthy to wear. His Son, in 1745, made this place a short visit. It is not certain whether the present Palace, which is a Seat of The Earl of Mansfield, as Viscount Stormont, and Heritable Keeper of this Palace, stands on the foundation ofthe ancient Palace ; though, from particular circumstances, it is very probable. It is pleasantly situate on an extensive lawn, sloping gently to the Tay, and is surrounded by siue plantations : it is in that style of architecture which prevailed in the Seventeenth Century ; and in one of the Chambers, which is called Tlie Queen's Room, is a bed of flowered crimson velvet, said to have been the work of Queen Mary, when a Prisoner in the Castle of Loch Leven. SCOONIE, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vi carage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 54-| bolls of bear, 44 bolls of meal, 29 bolls of oats, and 4 bolls of wheat, together with \u00a325. Sterling in money, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and a glebe : the manse is in good repair: Patron, The Crown : The Church is a neat, and modern building. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Leven) was 1681, and, in 1811, was 1726. The Church is \\ m. N. E. from Leven. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and nearly 2 miles in breadth, being bounded by the Firth of Forth on the South, from which the surface rises gradually to the Northern extremity. The whole is arable, and well cultivated, and the greatest part of it is inclosed. The climate is cold, but not unhealthy. A Fair is holden in the spring for lint seed ; and one every Month, from May to October, for white linen. Coals are"], [647, "S C R abundant. The Salary of the Grammar School is \u00a3200. Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a commodious School-house, and dwelling. The Public roads are in good repair. The estate of Durie was for nearly two centuries the property of the respectable family of Gibson, some of whom were particularly eminent in the law : it now belongs to Mr. Christie ; the elegant modern Mansion, which is surrounded with an extensive Policy, and commands a most delightful prospect, was built by Mr. Gibson. Killmaux is the residence of Mr. Tullidelph. There is a Seam of Coal on Durie, which is worked by Mr. Christie, and some Salt-pans at the month of the River of Leven, which empties itself at the Town, and forms the only harbour for small vessels. There used to be a good Salmon Fishery at this place, which has been much injured, by some late erections higher up the water, that prevent the Salmon getting up to spawn, and also by the number of Flax Spinning Mills in the neighbourhood. SCORTDALE, v. ORPHIR. SCOTLAND'S-WELL, in the Shire of Kinross ; and in the Parish of Port moak. This is a small Village, situate at the foot of the South Lomond or Bishop's Hill, where are numbers of copious springs of excellent water : one of them being so remarkable, that The Hospital, which stood near it, was called Fons Scoti\u00e6, now Scotland's- Well: this Hospital was founded by William Malvoisine, Bishop of St. Andrew's, who died about the year 1238 ; and was afterwards given to the Red Friars by his immediate successor : the ruins ofthe Church, and Hospital, are still to be seen near the village.

SEATON, in the Shire of Hadington : an ancient Parish, annexed to the Vicarage of Tranent, after the Reformation. Here was a Collegiate Church, founded for a Provost, six Prebendaries, two Singing-Boys, and a Clerk, out of several Chaplainries, united for that effect, by George the second Lord Seaton, on the 20th of June 1493 : he likewise built the Sacrist, and covered it over with stone, in the reign of King James the Fourth ; and dying soon afterwards, was buried near the High Altar of this Collegiate Church : this Edifice stands within the walls ofthe Castle or Mansion, and seems to have been an elegant building, adorned with sculpture, some of which is still remaining. Close by the Church, a little to the West, stood the ruins of Seaton House, the princely residence of The Earls of Winton. Upon the Attainder ofthe late Earl, in 1715, the Estate fell to the Crown, by whom, in 1719, it was sold to the York Buildings Company, who suffered the House to fall to decay. In 1790, the whole was taken down by the present proprietor, and a new Mansion built in the castellated form, on a plan of the late Mr. Adam. At Long Nidderie, within the Parish of Seaton, there was formerly a Chapel, the ruins of which are still apparent, and is popularly called \" John Knox's Kirk.\" Mr. Grose has preserved two views ofthe House, and one ofthe Church. In consideration of the services of Alexander Seyton, Robert the First erected his Town of Seyton into a Free Burgh, and granted at the same time, that he should have a Market, \" on the Sabbath-day. \" SEIL, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle. It constitutes part of the Parish of Killbrandon. This Island is about 3 miles long, and 2 miles broad, being separated from the Island of Eas dale by a Strait a few hundred feet broad, and from the Main-land by a narrow Pass over which a Bridge has been thrown. It is in general flat, yet not without hills, from the highest of which is a pleasing view of the numerous small Isles scattered over the Ocean, with the distant mountains of Mull, aud Jura. Here are Quarries of ardesia tegularis; but the principal attention of the Proprietors is turned to the Island of Easdale, where the slate has hitherto been found in great quantity.

SELKIRK, anciently SELE-CHYRCH, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate partly in the Shire of Selkirk, and partly in the District of Hawick, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3170., together with a Manse, and Glebe : Patron, The Duke of Roxburgh. It is in the Presbytery of Selkirk, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale.

For that part, which is in the Shire of Roxburgh, - 44. 44. 2466. It is 35 \\ m. S. S. E. from Edinburgh. The Market is on Tuesday, and is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the 25th of March, O. S., 15th of April, 4th of July, O. S., 10th of August, O. S., 20th of October, O. S., and 8th of Decem- ber, O. S. Selkirk, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Lanark, Linlith- gow, and Peebles, sends one Member to Parliament. It is pleasantly situate on a rising ground, on the South bank of the Etterick, commanding an extensive prospect in every direction. The Soil around it is dry; the Climate is healthy; and the Harvest is early. Poor's Rates have long. been established here : \u2014 all the money mortified to the Poor of this Parish, is 200 merks, the donation of William Ogilvie, Esq. , of Harhcood- Mires ; and of which the Kirk-Session are managers. The neighbourhood abounds with. a great variety of Game, and the rivers are well stocked with Fish. At Haining-Lin is a mineral Spring, which is found to be efficacious in scorbutic and scrofulous diseases. This Par- ish, exclusive ofthe Lands of Todridge, which are detached, and at a consider- able distance, is a square of about ten miles. It is mostly hilly, and is more adapted to pasturage than tillage, the number of Sheep here being computed at 22,000 ; but several of the farms have a large portion of low arable ground, lying towards, and along the sides of the rivers. The highest Hills are Peat- Law, aud Tliree Brethren; the former being elevated 1964, and the latter 1978 feet above the level of the sea, and from 1604 to 1618 feet above the bed of the river at Selkirk. Its name is descriptive of the situation of the place itself, and of the ancient state of the surrounding country : it is pro bable, that all the neighbouring Districts were formerly one continued Forest it is certain, that the banks of the rivers, by which the country is so happily vol. ii. 4 M"], [650, "S E L intersected, were once adorned with woods ; amidst which those plaintive airs were produced, the natural simplicity whereof are the Pride of Scot land, and the admiration of Strangers : the Forest is now reduced to a state of nakedness ; though exertions are making to remedy this evil, by nume rous plantations on the banks of the rivers. Selkirk gives the title of Earl to a branch ofthe ancient and Noble Family of Douglas. It is the County Town ; and here the Sheriff's, and Commissary's Courts, are holden. Contiguous to the Town is a considerable extent of arable ground, mostly the property of the Burgesses : it is of a light, but fertile soil, and is subdivided into a number of small inclosures. On the East ofthe Town, in a small Loch lately drained, is a fine bed of shell marie, which is highly beneficial in agriculture. Before the year 1124, there existed upon this agreeable site, a Castle, an old Town, and an ancient Church. At no great distance, may still be traced the ruins of Oldwark Castle, on the South-East bank of the Yarrow, which was probably built here by some ofthe Kings, in early times, as a commodious Hunting-Seat, and relinquished by them to the principal Warden of their extensive Forests : near this, arose a Village, even beyond the period of record: \u2014 Higher up, on the same side of the Yarrow, may be seen the ruins of Newark Castle, which was probably built by William, the first Earl of Douglas, after he succeeded to the Forest : here, a new Village had already arisen near the old one, before the year 1 124 : and, the two Villages, after the foundation of the Abbey, came to be distinguished by the appropriate names of Selkirk Regis, and Selkirk Abbatis: when the Monks were removed in 1128, the latter distinction was abo lished. Selkirk, which had this ancient foundation, long continued a Town, in The King's Demesne ; but, did not become a Royal Burgh, till the reign of James the Fifth ; and, on an occasion, that reflects high honour on the Loyalty, and Spirit, of this ancient Town. \u2014 When James the Fourth was marching for ward to his fate, at Floddon Field, a hundred Townsmen joined him, under the Town-Clerk, William Brydone ; they sought so stoutly, \" Where their brctve foresters were a' wede away,\" that very few of them returned, but loaded with the spoils taken from the Eng lish: of the trophies of that day, there yet remains in the possession ofthe Cor poration of Weavers, a Standard which was taken by a member of that Body, and which is still carried annually before them, upon the day of riding their com mon. The Sword of William Brydone, the Town-Clerk, who led the citizens"], [651, "S E L to battle, still remains in the possession of John Brydone, a citizen of Selkirk, his lineal descendant : and which is also borne in the processions ofthe Corpo ration, as the insignia ofthe Town. The desperate valour ofthe Citizens, how ever, so exasperated the English, that they reduced their defenceless Town to ashes : but their grateful Sovereign, James the Fifth, showed his sense of their services by a grant of an extensive tract of Etterick Forest, the timber to re-build it, and the property as a reward of their Heroism : the original grant was One thousand acres, but of this the surrounding Heritors have wrested from the Town of Selkirk, much more than half of it, by a claim founded upon the right of pas turage : it still draws a revenue of about \u00a3250. per annum, from the remainder. The Charter of James the Fifth is dated the 4th of March 1535 ; this was en larged in 1538 ; and again, in 1540, when the Baillies, and Community, were empowered to elect a Provost, every year. The Corporation now consists of Thirty-three Members, viz., 2 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, two old Baillies, an old Dean of Guild, and an old Treasurer, 5 Deacons of Trades, 5 Colleagues, 10 Merchant Counsellors, and 5 Trades' Counsellors : the Revenue ofthe Corporation, as returned to Parliament, is \u00a3284. per annum. By a Char ter of James the Fifth, which now lies forgotten among the Archives of the Corporation, William Brydone, the Town Clerk, and his Successors in office, were created Knights, on a recital ofthe bravery of Brydone, and the valour of the Townsmen. The King empowered, on that occasion, the Body- Politic of the Town to incorporate the Trades, particularly, the Soutars or Cordwainers, who are celebrated in song, with their Deacon, \" who, at the admission of every new Soutar, is obliged, by Charter, to provide him with a Maid, if he desire it:\" some Burgesses have pleaded their privilege; and were, by the Deacon, provided to their satisfaction. In Newark Castle, Anne, the first Duchess of Monmouth, and of Buccleugh, was born ; whose only inhabitants now are the moping Owl, and chattering Daw : It is likewise supposed by many, to be the Birth-place of Mary Scott, \" the flower of Yarrow :\" but, the better opinion seems to be, that she was the fair Daughter of Walter Scott, of Dryhope, and the beloved Wife of Scott, of Harden. They had a Daughter who married an Elliot, \" Gihby with the golden Garters ;\" and from them are descended Sir William Elliot, of Stobs, and the renowned Lord Heathfield. This Parish also gave birth to Andrew Prlngle, the late Lord Alemoor, of Haining, whose amiable manners, learning, and eloqueuce, rendered him equally the object of admiration, as the friend, the scholar, and the judge. There are the remains of 4M2"], [652, "S E L some military stations, and ofa fosse still visible on both sides ofthe Yarrow, which was the Western defence of The Earl of Montrose's Camp, before the decisive batte of Philiphaugh, on the 13th of September 1645. Some Skulls of the Urus, and a Roman spear, were lately discovered in a moss, near to Sel kirk, and were presented to The Society of Antiquaries of Edinburgh. According to Mr. Chalmers, the only Religious House, which seems to have been ever founded, within this Shire, was an establishment for Monks of Tyrone, at Selkirk, as early as 1113. Here they remained, during fifteen years of Peni tentiary trial. RadulPhus, who conducted his Monks to this retired spot within the Forest, was the original Abbot. He was succeeded by William, the second Abbot, who is recollected by Fordun. And, William was followed, before the year 1124, by the third Abbot, Herbert, who ruled the Monks, when they were removed, on account of inconvenient accommodation, to Kelso, in 1128 ; and who rose to be Bishop of Glasgow, upon the death of John, in 1147. This Abbey was settled near the King's Castle, and Village ; and the attendants upon the Monks soon reared a new Hamlet, which obtained the appropriate appella tion of Selkirk Abbatis. The settlement in the Forest ofa body of strangers, who, as they had seen other countries, and knew other modes of life, must have intro duced here some improvements. Even after the removal of the Monks, the Abbot, during many an age, had his Manor around the Town, with his Baronial Court, at the Bridge, and his Church, with his Grange, his Husbandmen, and Cottagers; together with his Mill, his Malt- kiln, and his Brewhouses. While the King's Castle remained here, the Abbot was bound, by the tenure of his land, to act as the King's Chaplain, within the Royal Castle. The Duke of Roxburgh, who wears \" the fair-lined slippers\" ofthe Abbot, is bound to act as Chaplain here, when the King shall restore his Castle, and to repair the Bridge, while he enjoys the land, that was amortized to its use. The ancient Jurisdiction of the Archdeacon of Teviotdale, was transferred, by the Reform ation, to the Synod of Merse and Teviotdale : the Presbytery of Selkirk is of modern establishment : Melros having been the seat of this Presbytery, soon after the Reformation. In the ancient statement of the property of the Monks of Kelso, they say, they had the Church of Selkirk Regis, \" in rectoria\", which was usually worth \u00a320. a year, and also the Church of Selkirk Abbatis, \" in rectoria,\" which was commonly worth 40s. per annum. The two Villages, no doubt soon run into each other, as the Abbot possessed much property within, and around both of them. How long the two Churches remained separate, is"], [653, "S H A \"Unknown ; even tradition has forgotten, that there ever were two. The Abbot, probably, conjoined them, upon the economical principle ofthe Reformation, io save the expense of a Curate. The Church of Selkirk Regis was served by a Vicar, who was supported by Vicarage dues. When the Reformation, had dis solved the Abbey of Kelso, the Patronage ofthe Church of Selkirk was trans ferred to the progenitor of The Duke of Roxburgh, who is now the Patron of the Parish Church. The Town of Selkirk stands in 55\u00b0 34' 10\" North Latitude, and 2D 52' Longitude West from Greenwich ; and it is situate, according to the result of the barometer, 520 feet above the level ofthe sea. SELKIRK, SHIRE, or ETTERICK FOREST. This Shire is about 27 miles in length, and 18 miles at its greatest breadth : and contains 122,880 acres Scotch, or 153,600 acres English, the customary measure ofthe Shire; of which, about 6880 acres Scotch are arable, the remainder being principally ap propriated to the pasturage of sheep. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 5070, and, in 1811, was 5889. It is watered by the Tweed, and the two pastoral streams, the Etterick, and the Yarrow. It sends one Member to Parliament.

According to tradition, this Church, which.for merly contained a very considerable quantity of plate, was plundered by French pirates, who safely escaped with their booty ; but a storm arising immediately after they had put to sea, the ship was dashed upon a rock, at a little distance from the shore, opposite to the Church, and every person on board perished. In me mory of this event, the rock has ever since been styled, The Frenchmen's Rock. SERDGOIN, v. FEN WICK. SERESORT, LOCH, v. RUM, ISLAND SERF'S, ST., ISLE, v. PORTMOAK. SHA HOLM, v. UNST, ISLAND.

These are three Islands, well known to Mariners : one of them seems to have been dedicated to The Virgin Mary, as it is named Moair, or Mary's Island, and in it there are the remains of a Chapel. Black cattle are pastured upon them all, and they are famous for fattening sheep ; but particu larly some small rocks in the neighbourhood, which have fine grass upon their"], [654, "S H A summits.

It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 744. and, in 1811, was 726. It is 3 m. N from Kirkwall. This Island is about 7 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth : the soil, though in most places thin and shallow, is naturally fertile : around the whole Island the shores are low, and to a consid erable distance inland, pretty level ; but towards the middle, the land is much higher. Agriculture is greatly neglected here. The Heritors of this Parish are, The Crown for the Bishop's Lands, of which Thomas Lord Dundas is Tacks man; Robert Laing, Esq., of Str enzie, and Colonel Balfour, of Elwick, who together possess the whole Island. This Parish formerly made part ofthe Tem porality of the Bishoprick of Orkney. The Estates of Sound, and How, and Hammer, the former the property of Colonel Balfour, and the latter of Mr. Laing, are feus from the Bishops of Orkney. How is the Seat of Mr. Laing, where he has an old House pleasantly situate, and which by improvement might be made one of the most fertile and agreeable spots in Shapinsay : in the neigh bourhood of this place, however, he has had lime-kilns for many years, by which he has put in motion a considerable portion of industry. At Cliff dale-House , Colonel Balfour, who is the only resident Heritor, has shewn the most com mendable zeal in the cultivation and improvement of his estate : he has built an elegant House, and laid out an extensive garden, and all around him wears a cheerful and pleasing aspect : by the side of the Harbour of Eltcick, he has erected a little Village, and filled it with useful artisans, and labourers. The Standing Stone of Shapinsay, and The Black Stone of Odin, are supposed to be the remains of places of Scandinavian worship. On the West shore, nearly opposite to the rock of Vasa, where the tides are rapid and the sea is shallow, is a place known by the name of Grucula, or Agricola; and whither, tradition says, one of Agricola's ships, in his celebrated voyage round the Island of Britain, was driven, and stranded ; and what seems to confirm the tradition is, that Roman"], [655, "S H A Coins are said to have been discovered there. Here are some of the Fiefs' Houses. The Harbour of Ekvick is the only one of the Island, and which has from 4 to 6 fathom water, over a bottom of hard clay, covered with sand: on the West side of it, is a fine beach, with abundance of excellent fresh water : and, as it opens to the South-West, it is extremely convenient for ships bound to the Southward : here Haco, King of Norway, is supposed to have anchored with his fleet, in 1263, on his expedition against Alexander the Third, King of Scotland. About 120 tons of kelp are made here annually. The Climate is very salubrious. Here is abundance of excellent peat. At the East end of the Island some whin-stone appears, inclining to the bas altic form. Lime-stone is also found, but not of rich quality. The Hill ground, or Common, is covered with salix argentea, or silver-leaved creeping willow, which lies prostrate on the Earth. Of this Parish the late worthy George Barry, D. D., was Minister, and where he died in the month of Sept ember 1805, aged 57, leaving a Widow and nine children : Much of his time was devoted to the History of the seven Islands of the Orkneys, and this very valuable composition made its appearance a little before the Author's death, in one volume Quarto: it was so well received by the Public, that it has since gone to a Second Edition, under the care of The Reverend James Headrick, 4to. London, 1808. From his character as a Preacher, Dr. Barry was appointed by The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge their Superintendant of the Schools in this distant part of Scotland. The strata are principally composed of sandstone, sandstone-flag, shistose clay, limestone, and basalt. SHAWFIELD, in the Under Ward, and Shire of Lanark: in the Parish of Rutherglen. This is a highly cultivated estate ; which, after passing through the families of Hamilton, Ellies, Anstruther, and Campbell, has lately been feued out into a number of beautiful houses, that are occupied by manufacturers, and others from the City of Glasgow. Of these, the villa of Dr. Cleghorn is the most extensive, and the grounds are tastefully laid out: it is beautifully situate, and has a commanding prospect ofthe windings ofthe Clyde for a con siderable distance, and ofthe City of Glasgow and the adjacent country. SHAW PARK, in the Shire of Clackmannan ; and in the Parish of Alloa. It is If m. N. N. E. from Alloa. This is become 'the Residence of the Noble Family of Cathcart, since their disposal ofthe great Estate and beautiful place of Auchincruive, which they possessed for ages in the Shire of Ayr. Their pos sessions in this, and the adjoining Parishes, descended to the late Lord"], [656, "SHE Cathcart from his Grandmother Lady Shaw ; whose husband had purchased them, in the beginniug of the Eighteenth Century, at a judicial sale, from the Bruces, of Clackmannan. The House is very magnificent, and the grounds are delightfully varied, and set off the large Plantations to great advantage. SHAWS, v. CASTLE-TOWN. SHEEP, ISLAND, off the Coast of Argyle ; and in the Parish of South end. It is a small Island, situate to the Southward ofthe Peninsula of Cantyre, and is well calculated for the pasturage of Sheep, from whence it derives its name. SHERIFF-HALL, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of Inver- Esk. It is lj m. N. from Dalkeith. Here are the remains of a large Roman Camp; and a Hamlet, near it, bears the appropriate name of Camp-End. SHERIFF MUIR, v. DUNBLANE. SHERIFF MUIR, The, v. STOBO. SHETLAND, or ZETLAND ISLES, these are the Northern Division of the Northern Isles of Scotland, and are united with The Orkney Islands in the formation of a Stewartry. The Southern Promontory of the Mainland is situate in the Latitude of 59\u00b0 59' North, and the Northern extremity of Unst, the most remote of the whole group, is in the Latitude of 61\u00b0 15' North: and the meridian of London passes through it. The Islands belonging to this Division are very numerous, but many of them are only small holms or rocky islets, and are used only for pasturage. The Resident Population of the 29 Inhabited Islands, in 1801, was 22,379, and, in 1811, was 22,915. The climate is inhospitable: the spring is late, the summer is short, the autumn is wet and foggy, and the winter is long and boisterous. The coasts afford numerous bays and safe harbours, and the ocean abounds with fish : in so much that agriculture is much neglected for the fisheries. The property in Shetland consists of the three divisions of Crown Lands, Kirk Lands, and Udal Lands, which are holden by the same tenures as in Orkney. The rents are generally paid one half in butter, at Lammas; and the other half in money, at Martinmas. Free-stone, and lime- stone are abundant ; there is also. great plenty of peat, and turf, for fuel ; and there are likewise considerable quantities of marl, and several quarries of good slate. The Scotch Laws, customs, manners, dress, and language prevail here : and they have a Sheriff-Substitute, and other Magistrates, for the administration of Justice. From their great intercourse with the Dutch fishermen, many ofthe inhabitants speak the Dutch language with great fluency.

LEUCHARS. SHEUGLIE, v. MEIKLY. SHIELDHILL, v. POLMONT. SHIELHILL, BRIDGE, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Kirrie- Muir. The Bridge of Shielhill was built across the river Esk in the year 1776, under the direction of Mr. Brown, of Dunkeld, and is about 4 m. E. from Kirrie- Muir. It forms a spacious arch, and is considered a very elegant piece of work manship. The surrounding scenery is very romantic, and the place is rendered remarkable as being the Scene of Dr. Jamieson's Poem of Water Kelpie ; and in honour of his Mystic Majesty, a fanciful figure, cut in rude workmanship, is placed in the centre ofthe arch. Between this Bridge, and the old Tower of Inver-Carity, the rivers Prosen and Carity form a junction with the Esk; near which is a good Chalybeate spring that is much resorted to. SHIEL HOUSE, v.

SHISKEN, in the Isle of Arran, and Shire of Bute : in the Parish of Kill- Mory : Here is a Chapel of Ease, and in the Church-yard is a tomb (now broken by some sacrilegious fellow, in search of treasure), called the tomb of St. Maol Jos, i. e. The Servant of Jesus ; a Saint who fixed his residence on the little Island of Lamblash, and officiated by turns at Shisken, where he died at the advanced age of One Hundred, and was there interred. It is situate upon the Western coast of the Island, at the distance of six computed miles from Kill- Mory. These lands formerly belonged to the Abbey of Saddale, in Cantyre. See, Lamblash. SHIVES, v.

This Parish is 10 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth. The surface is in general level, having several hills on its Eastern border ; particularly the Hirst, the Tilling, and the Cant Hills. The soil is chiefly clay, with a mixture of loam on the banks ofthe rivers ; and, by the exertions of some ofthe proprietors, the greater part is inclosed, and beginning to assume a more fertile and pleasant aspect. The whole of this extensive Parish, the lands of Blair-mucks and Mur diston excepted, (the former having been the property of the Laird of Dundas, but now of Sir John Inglis, of Cramond, and the latter of Scott, of Buccleuch, till exchanged with a family of the name of Inglis, for lands in the Shire of Rox burgh), belonged to the Family of Hamilton, from the year 1378 to 1630 ; when The Marquis of Hamilton sold the greater part of this Barony. The public roads are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a free house, and Candlemas offer ings. The climate is particularly healthy. Peats, coals, and iron-stone are abundant ; and the latter is worked to a great extent at the Omoa Iron Works, erected in 1787, on the estate of Colonel William Dalrymple, of Cleland ; and on the estate of Mr. David Young, of Little Hairshaw. Near the House of Murdiston, now the property of Colonel Hamilton, of the 2d regiment of Dra goons, stood The Abbey or Priory of St. Bertram, of which no vestige now remains. SHUNA, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part of the Parish of Killbrandon. This is a small Island, and contains a Quarry of excellent Slate. It also abounds with lime-stone. See, Killbrandon. SHUNA, ISLAND, off the Coast of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Ard namurchan.

These Hills, which are a continuation ofthe Ochil Hills, extend from Perth Eastward, and terminate near Brechin. When they arrive at the frontiers of the Shire of Forfar, they form three Divisions ; one range from Lundie stretches Eastward, and declines in the neighbourhood of Monifieth ; a a second range from Auchterhouse proceeds also Eastward, and makes the gentle rise on the South of Tealing, the Hill of Duntroon, and the Knock-Hills near Arbroath : the third and highest range stretches North-Eastward, and forms Oct J the Hill of Lorse, in the Parish of lnverarity ; and from Caerbuddo, in a detached part of Guthrie Parish, may be traced in its progress, till it passes through the Parishes of Kinell, Mary-Town, and Craig, on the Eastern Coast. These hills form the South side ofthe valley of Strathmore, and receive their namefrom that circumstance ; Sud-laics being the Gaelic name for South Hills. The mountains of the ridge are of various heights ; Sidlaiv Hill, which is the most lofty, being elevated 1406 feet above the level ofthe sea. SIMPRIN, in the Shire of Berwick : a Chapelry, annexed, in 1761, to the Vicarage of Swinton. It is a small Village, at the distance of 3j m. N. from Coldstream. The whole ofthe ancient Parish of Simprin was long the property of the ancient family of Cockburn, of Langton, but their affairs falling into disorder, the estate was sequestrated, and purchased, about the year 1758, by Patrick Lord Elibank, for Eighteen thousand Pounds. The most remarkable object in Simprin, is the very high and spacious Barn, which was built by the Cockburns, consisting of a threshing floor and large and lofty granaries. Lord Elibank thinking its height exposed it to storms, lowered the roof considerably, but left the gabels standing, so that they still show the original altitude of the building, which is seen from almost every part ofthe Shire of Berwick.

A General Post-Office is established here. This Parish contains about 8000 acres ; of which, 2300 are in-field, 3056 are out-field, 1640 are pasture, 534 are moss, and the remainder are black muir. The general appearance is hilly, and rocky ; and the predominant quality of the soil is that of gravel. The air is dry, and healthy. The Loch of Skene, which is about a mile in length, and upwards ofa mile in breadth, abounds with pike, and eels, end various kinds of aquatic birds. Moor-stone, and granite, are in great plenty. Peats are the common fuel. The roads are tolerable. Around the House of Skene, the ele gant residence of George Skene, Esq., is a considerable extent of flourishing plantations.

This Parish is about 2\\ miles in length, and nearly of the same breadth ; containing between two and three thousand acres of land. The general appearance is uneven ; but none of the eminences deserve the name of hills, and they are all covered with verdure to their summits. The soil is in general light, and tolerably fertile ; but the crops, from its elevated situation, are liable to be affected by frost, towards the end of Summer. The air is pure and whole some. The fuel used here is mostly coal, which is brought from the dis tance of 15 miles: there is only one Moss in the Parish, and it is nearly ex hausted. The roads are in bad repair \u2022 the Statute labour is exacted in kind, and is found to be inadequate. The Fairs are holden on the Tuesday before the 12th of May, the third Tuesday after the llth of May, the first Wednesday after the 1 1th of June, and on the 15th of September.

It is separated from the Main-land of Scotland by a chan nel about three leagues broad, except at the Ferry of Keil, where it is not more than half a mile from the nearest part of Inverness. The coasts are, in general, bold and rocky, abounding with many safe and commodious Bays. Between the mountains, which are very numerous, and rugged, are some fertile vallies ; and, towards the sea-coast, it is plain and arable, producing good crops. The Climate, though very variable, is not unhealthy. It abounds with game, and"], [663, "SKY aquatic birds of all kinds. The whole Island is divided into the Parishes of Bracadale, Duirinish, Killmuir, Portree, Sleat, Snizort, and Strath; a description of each of which is separately given. By a Memorial presented to The Com missioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, by The Right Honourable Alexander Wentworth Lord Macdonald, for himself and other Proprietors of land in the Shire of Inverness, in July 1804, it appears, \" That the Inhabi tants of the very large and populous parts ofthe County of Inverness, compre hending the whole ofthe Isle of Skye and the Isles of North and South Uist and Harris, and the extensive grazing estates of Glenelg and Loch Alsh, have been always in the practice of sending their cattle (the principal source ofthe revenue of that country) by the Ferry of Kyle Rhea, Bernera, and along the Military road leading by Fort Augustus to the Markets in the Low Country : Indeed, from the situation ofthe country, this has hitherto been the only practicable line for driving cattle to Market ; and, for want of roads through Skye, and from the Military road having gone into decay, the loss of cattle has been very great. \u2014 That your Memorialist perceives from the Report made by The Honourable Commissioners to Parliament, that a line of road has been adopted by them, and he understands now contracted for, leading from the Military road at Loch Oich, near Fort Augustus, through Glen-Garry to the end of Loch Hourn ; and that Mr. Tel ford, in his Report of this road, dated on the 21st of December 1803, states, that ' this line of road may be connected with Bernera, either through Glenelg or through Glen Shiel, and past the Shiel House, or by both of these lines of road. In this point of view, it is of the utmost importance as a Drove-road from a very extensive tract of country.' From this statement of Mr. Telford, The Honourable Commissioners will perceive that the great advantage of this junction ofthe road with Bernera by Shiel House, and of course by Kyle Rhea, did not escape the notice of that discerning engineer, though his attention was not directed to it by any application from your Memorialist or the other Proprie tors interested in that line. The Memorialist is humbly of opinion, that this connexion of the road, already begun through Glen-Garry, with Bernera and Kyle Rhea by one or more branches, as suggested by Mr. Telford, would be of very great benefit and utility to that part of the Highlands, and in particular to the Districts above mentioned, and indeed to the whole Kingdom,, by giving access to the Isle of Skye, and enabling persons to send for the breed of cattle of that Island, now admitted to be the best in Scotland. Sensible of the advantages which must result from opening as speedily as possible, and in the manner"], [664, "SLA proposed by Mr. Telford, a safe communication with the Isle of Skye by a branch from the Glen-Garry road by Shiel House, Bernera, and Kyle Rhea ; and beino- of opinion, that without such branch the road from Loch Oich to the Head of Loch Hourn would be of very little public benefit, the Memorialist is induced to request the aid of The Honourable Commissioners under the Autho rity ofthe aforesaid Act of Parliament, and he is ready to comply with the regu lations ofthe said Act, for making the said branch of road. The Memorialist begs to suggest the propriety of surveying the line of road through the Isle of Skye, 1st. From the Ferry of Kyle Rhea, by Broadford and Sconcer, to Dunvegan and Stein. 2nd. A branch from Sconcer, Northward by Portree to the Aird of Trotter- nish. 3d. From Broadford, Southward to Armadale and Ardavasar Bay in the Dis- trict of Sleat, and the necessary breastworks at the Ferry there, on which road and Ferry your Memorialist has already laid out a large sum of money. And, if The Honourable Commissioners shall adopt this line and the branches therefrom above humbly recommended, the Memorialist is willing to make further efforts towards the completion of so great and essential an improvement.\" \u2014 Most of these roads are now (in 1811) happily completed, and the remainder are in great progress. \" I never was in any house ofthe Islands,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" where I did not find books in more languages than one, if I staid long enough to want them, except one from which the family was removed. Literature is not neglected by the higher Rank ofthe Hebridians. \u2014 In Skye there are two Grammar Schools, where boarders are taken to be regularly educated. \u2014 The Political tenets ofthe Islanders I was not curious to investigate, and they were not eager to obtrude. Their conversation is decent and inoffensive.. They disdain to drink for their principles, and there is no disaffection at their tables. I never heard a health offered by a Highlander that might not have circulated with propriety within the Precincts of The King's Palace. \u2014 The various kinds of Superstition which pre vailed here, as in all other regions of ignorance, are by the diligence of the Min isters almost extirpated.\" \u2014 See, Inverness, and Rannoch.

The arable lands on each side of the Avon, for about half a mile, are light and fertile; but, at a short distance, the ground becomes a strong clay, and gradu ally degenerates into a muiry or mossy cold soil, upon which the crops seldom come to perfection. There is plenty of fuel in the Parish, both coals and peat. When the annexation was made to this Parish, the Inhabitants of that District were allowed to build an Aisle, for their own accommodation, upon the North side of the Church, at their own expense, and to uphold it for twenty years ; and the Heritors of Slamannan were bound to uphold the old Church for the same Number of years ; after which, they were aH to bear any expense upon the Church, and church-yard walls, in proportion to their valuations : but, as they were otherwise annexed only quoad sacra, they pay no part of the Minister's stipend. The Superiority of this Parish was vested in the Earls of Callander, until their forfeiture in 1715, when it became the property of the Crown, toge ther with the patronage ofthe Church. SLATEFORD, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Edzell. It is 6 m. N. b. W. from Brechin. This is a small Village, situate near the Western bank of the river North Esk, and is a place of some trade. Here is a Salmon fishery, the property of The Honourable Mr. Maule. Its principal manufacture is that of shoes. The Market or Fair is holden annually on Wednesday after the 26th of August : it has of late become considerable, for cattle, and sheep : but it is chiefly remark able, for the vast concourse of persons who attend from the adjacent country. SLEAT, or SLATE, in the Isle of Skye, and in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 800 merks Scotch, in cluding Communion elements : there is neither manse, nor designed glebe, the Incumbent being accommodated with a Farm, and tolerable Mansion-house :"], [667, "S L E Patron, Lord Macdonald : The Church, which was built in 1681, has since undergone repeated repairs, and is the largest Religious edifice in the Island. It is in the Presbytery of Skye, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1903, and, in 1811, was 1936. It is situate to the Westward of the Main-land of Scotland, being separated by a Channel which varies from a quarter of a mile to two leagues in breadth. This Parish is about 17 miles in length, and from a mile to three miles and a half in breadth, being, like all parts ofthe Isle of Skye, intersected by different arms of the sea. The two extremities are hilly, and consist of considerable tracts of tolerable pasture, well calculated for rearing black cattle : the whole ofthe West side ofthe Par- ish is composed ofa pleasant mixture of arable, and uneven ground, and con- tains several patches of Wood, both natural and planted: the East side ofthe Parish, particularly from the Farm of Knock to Tormore, being an extent of five miles in length and from a mile to a mile and a half in breadth, is arable, the soil being deep clay ; but, notwithstanding its Southern aspect, the Harvests are, in general, late, by reason ofthe dampness of the ground. The Barony of Sleat is now subdivided into 26 different Farms or Tenements. Lord Macdonald is the sole Heritor. The fuel is entirely turf, or peat : but there are indications of coal. The Salary, and emoluments of the Parochial School, are about \u00a324. Sterling. Here is an excellent and well known Harbour, called Isle Oransay, which is much frequented by small vessels, chiefly Herring-busses ; though Ships from the Baltic occasionally touch there. Here are two Castles, partly ancient and partly modern, called Dnnskaich, and /' Chamuis, i.e. The Castle at the end ofthe Bay ; the former of which is celebrated in the Poems of Ossian. There are also five Duns or Danish Forts ; at one of which, called Dun-Flo, are a number of human bones, being those of a party of King William's troops, which, having landed from a ship commanded by Captain Porringer, in the month of September 1688, were forced by the natives to re-embark after a sharp skirmish, in which the Royalists were defeated with the loss of 26 men : Arma- dale is a neat house, built near the sea-shore where the Macdonalds had once a seat, which was burned at the above period : it is now inhabited by Sir Alex- ander Macdonald's factor. An excellent line of road, 16 miles in length, has been made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, from Broadford Bay in the Parish of Strath, which terminates on the coast, at Arda- vasat Bay ; where a Pier has been constructed for sheltering the Ferry boats, and for conveniently embarking travellers and cattle passing to and from the 402"], [668, "<\u2022 S M E Main-land at the Ferry at Arasaig ; from whence, by means of the Loch-na- Gaul road, the communication with Fort William is now open. SMALL-HOLM, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Vicarage, which, in the ancient Taxatio, was rated at 45 merks ; the Stipend, in 1811, being \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe : Patron, Baillie, of Jerviswood : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Lauder, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 446, and, in 1811, was 455. It is 6 m. N W. b. W. from Kelso. This Parish is about four miles in length, and about three miles in breadth. The surface exhibits an agreeable variety of high and low grounds : and the soil is various, and tolerably fertile : In 1739 and 1740, eighteen hundred acres of land in run-rig were divided, and let into large farms. The air is healthy. The turnpike road, from Kelso to Edinburgh, runs through the village, in the middle of which the Church stands. On the South West corner of the Parish, is a large square Tower, belonging to Mr. Scott, of Harden, which is called Small-Holm Tower, or Sandy Knoic ; and being situate on a considerable eminence, it forms a conspicuous Land-mark at sea, to vessels navigating the coast to Berwick. SMALL ISLES, a Parish of the Hebrides, comprehending the Islands of Eigg, Canna, Muck, and Rum : of which Eigg is annexed to the Shire of Inver ness, and the other three belong to the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle. Small Isles was a part ofthe Parish of Sleat, until the year 1726 ; when it was erected into a separate charge, and was called the Parish of Eigg or Short Isles, that being the most valuable Island, and in which the Minister now resides. In process of time, the name was, by an an easy transition, changed from Short to Small Isles. A description of each of these Islands is given separately. The Resident Population of the Parish of Small Isles was \u2014 In 1794. In 1811. For that Part, which is in the Shire of Argyle, being the Islands of Canna, Muck, and Rum, - _ _ 940. 1105.

SNIZORT, in the Isle of Skye, and in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, including the glebe, was about \u00a375. Sterling : there is no manse : The Patronage is claimed by the Crown, and the Laird of Macleod : there are four places of Worship, at a considerable distance from each other, but the vestiges only of the Parish Church remain. It is in the Presbytery of Skye, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2144, and, in 1811, was 2275. This Parish is about 12 computed miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth : its form is irregular, the Western part being intersected by an arm ofthe sea, called Loch Snizort, which stretches at least 4 miles inland, in a direction nearly South-East: it is narrow, and shallow, and forms numerous bays, and inlets ; and there is a Ferry over it. The general appearance is hilly, and mountainous : but the sea- coast, and many of the glens, afford some pretty extensive arable fields. The soil is various; but a gravelly loam, on a cold clay, is the most prevalent. Game is abundant. About a quarter of a mile distant from the shore, the river Snizort forms an Island of nearly an acre and a half in extent ; upon which are the ruins of an ancient and large Cathedral, which, in all probability was once the Metropolitan Church ofthe whole Island of Skye; it is now the burying-place of many families, in this as well as the adjacent Parishes. There are several Cairns, and the vestiges of many Druidical temples, and Danish forts. The Wmter, and Spring, are generally damp, cold, and piercing : but the climate is not unwholesome. There are six Proprietors, of whom Lord Macdonald is by far the most considerable. There are no Public Schools. The quantity of Kelp made here is about 50 tons annually, and this only on the Western shores ; those on the East being bold, deep, and difficult of access. Peats are the general fuel. By a Letter from Colonel A. Macdonald, of Lyndale, and Mr. Macleod, of Raasay, dated the 4th of April 1806, to James Hope, Esq. W. S., Agent for The Parliamentary Commissioners, it appears, that the line of road from Dun- vegan to Portree, by Snizort, having been through some mistake omitted, they state, \" that it is the second of consequence to the Island, as connecting the East and West coasts of it ; and being also the line by which tfie cattle from The Long Island are driven to the Market of Portree, as well as those of the Baronies of"], [670, "S O R Duirinish, Waternish, and Districts of Arnisort, Lyndale, and Snizort, which form about one-third of the population and extent of the Island; it is also ofthe utmost consequence, as forming, when opened, an easy access to the harbours and fishing Lochs of Dunvegan Bay, Arnisort, Snizort, and Portree, being the principal Lochs in the whole Island for the resort of herrings and vessels.\" This useful road is now completed, and extends 19-j miles in length, from the Village of Portree to the hill ofBuleagrumuie, and by Loch Snizort to a junction with the Stein road, near Dunvegan. SNOASSUMUL, ISLE, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : this is a very small Isle, which constitutes part ofthe Parish of Barray, and is uninhabited. SO AY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, v. BRACADALE. SO-AY, ISLAND, off the Western Coast of Sutherland ; and in the Par ish of Assint.

SORBIE, in the District of Machers, and Shire of Wigtown : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse was re-built in 1778 : the glebe including the grass and arable land, garden, and site of the manse and offices, is nearly 10 acres ; but of these, there are 4 acres of the worst land in the neighbourhood : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Wigtown, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Garlies- Town) was 1091, and, in 1811, was 1265. It is 4 m. N. from Whitehorn. This Parish is"], [671, "S O R about 6 miles in length, and from two to six miles in breadth, stretching along the Western coast ofthe Bay of Wigtown. The face ofthe country is beautiful, being varied with little hills and plains, which are exceedingly fertile ; and, where uncultivated, are covered with luxuriant verdure, and afford excellent pasture for almost innumerable flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle : the soil is not deep, but exceeding fine: the greater part is inclosed, and well sheltered by vast plantations ; and, to the patriotic exertions and superior skill of The Earl of GalloWay, the fertility and beauty of this Parish are in a great measure to be ascribed. The roads are in good repair! On the North-West border of the Parish, is a fine fresh water Lake, called Dowalton Lake ; so named, from having been formerly the property of a great Family of the name of Macdowal, whose place of residence was near it : it is more than three miles in circumfer ence, and abounds with perch, pike, and eels. There are upwards of 12 miles of sea coast, including the Bays ; fish of various kinds are in plenty, but as the inhabitants are now fully occnpied in agriculture, fishing is nearly neglected, and the fishing boats on the coast are very few. The head-lands are Crugleton, and Eagerness ; and the principal Bays are those of Garlies- Town, \u2014 Rigg, now called Hunter's Bay, in compliment to Captain Hunter of the Royal Navy, who there came to an anchor with Lord Garlies, \u2014 and the Ports of Allan, Whaple, and Inner well ; besides many other smaller Bays, where vessels, loaded with lime and sea-shells, deliver their cargoes. Some ofthe most ancient breed of Galloway horses are among the mountains, and less improved parts of the country: they are said to have sprung from a Spanish breed, which were pre served on this coast where one of the vessels of the Armada was wrecked, after sailing round by the Pentland Firth. Peat is the fuel commonly used ; but coals are imported from Cumberland. There are the remains of two strong Castles, on the Head-lands of Crugleton, and Eagerness, which are called by the same names ; the former of which is said to have been the residence of the very an cient and wealthy Family of the Vauses, now Vances, of Bam- Barrow ; and is now the property of Sir Stair Agnew, Bart., of Lochnaw ; the Castle of Eagerness is altogether destroyed. Here are three Parochial Schools, and all the youth are properly educated according to their stations. Galloway House is the splendid Mansion ofthe Ancient and Illustrious Family of Stewart, Earl of Galloway, where His Lordship resides the greater part of the year: it is a laro-e and elegant edifice, commanding a delightful prospect, and surrounded with the ancient and extensive Family estate, which has lately been so highly"], [672, "S O R improved by its noble owner : the rooms are spacious, and the Library con tains many Thousand volumes of well selected Books, in various languages.

It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Catrine) was 2606, and, in 1811, was 3348. It is 3 m. E.S.E. from Mauchline. This Parish contains about 23,660 English acres, stretching along the Northern bank ofthe river Ayr. The surface is much diversified ; and the prevailing soil is a reddish clay, upon a bottom of blackish till. Coals, peat, lime-stone, iron-stone, and red free-stone, all of good quality, are in abundance. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. The roads, and bridges, are in tolerable repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a dwelling, and garden. Gillmillscroft, the seat of Mr. Gray, and Auchmonnach, of Mr. Campbell, are neat and commodious Mansions. Sorn Castle is most delightfully situate on a lofty and well wooded rocky terrace overlooking the water of Ayr : about the year 1406, the lands of Sorn, with several others in the District of Kyle were acquired by Andrew Hamilton, third son of Sir David Hamilton, of Cadzow, ancestor to the Duke of Hamilton : this gentleman married Agnes, a daughter of Sir Hugh Campbell, of Loudon, Sheriff of Ayr, by whom he had a son. Sir Robert Hamilton, of Sorn and Sanquhar. Sir Robert married a daughterof Sir William Crawfurd, of Loch Norris : and Sir William Hamilton, of Sorn and Sanquhar, a son of this marriage, was one ofthe Senators ofthe College of Justice, and Lord Treasurer to King James the Fifth. His Lord Treasurer married;a daughter ofthe family of Cassillis, by whom he had an heiress, Isabel Hamilton, who married George Lord Seton, and by him was mother to Robert first Earl of Winton, to Alexander, first Earl of Dunfermlin, and Margaret the wife of Claud Hamilton, Lord Paisley, ancestor to The Earl"], [673, "sou of Abercorn. The Lands, and Castle of Sorn were sold by the succeeding Earl of Winton to the family of Loudon ; and, after remaining in this family upwards of 150 years, they were sold to William Tennent, Esq., of Poole, in 1782 ; who having completely repaired the old Castle, and built a large addition to it, nearly upon the same plan, afterwards sold both the Castle, and Estate. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. SOUL-SKERRY, a small Isle or Rock, in the Atlantic Ocean, which lies W. N.W. about ten leagues distant from the Village of Stromness Hither Seals resort in great numbers ; and a sloop was usually sent once a year, about Martinmas, to kill them : but the Surge is so great around this Rock, that it often happened that the Fishermen could not effect a landing ; or. if they were landed, themselves, and the Seals which they had killed, could not be got off but with considerable difficulty, and risk. And, since a fatal accident, in No vember 1786, this perilous fishing has been abandoned. SOULS SEAT, in The District of The Rhyns, and Shire of Wigtown. It is situate near Stranraer.

The air is moist and chilly, but not unhealthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a House, and Garden. The fuel now generally used, is coal ; which is brought chiefly from Ryeehester in vol. h. 4 P"], [674, "sou the County of Northumberland, at the distance of 15 miles. Free-stone, is abun dant, and there are inexhaustible Quarries of lime-stone, in the higher parts of the Parish : there is also an excellent Quarry of white hard stone, which is much used for chimney-grates, as it endures the greatest heat, and lasts for many years. Here are several Tumuli, and the ruins of many old Towers ; but none of them are large ; and in some places they are nearly entire. At the Village of Chester's, and many other places, on the adjacent heights, there are also the ruins of some strong fortifications or camps : their form is circular, and, in gen eral, they are quite distinct : and each camp is apparently stationed within view of South-Dean Laic ; which, according to tradition, was a place of obser vation, where fires were kindled at the approach of an enemy. The roads are in good repair.

Although the walls of the old Church of Southwick, which stands in a very romantic small Strath, about four miles East from the Parish Church at Colvend, still remain in many places entire, yet there is not the slightest tradition of any Incumbent at Southwick, or of any circumstance relat ing to it as a separate charge. It appears to have been annexed to Colvend, ever since the Reformation. But however long these Parishes have been united, their ancient boundaries are still distinctly known : and Colvend is to South wick, in point of rental, extent of territory, and population, nearly as three to two.

On Soutra Hill, which is about 1000 feet above the level ofthe sea, and from whence the prospect is most ex tensive and beautiful, are the ruins of an Hospital, founded in 1 164, by Malcolm the Fourth, King of Scotland, for the relief of Pilgrims, and poor and sickly per sons. It had the privilege of Sanctuary: and the road called The Girthgate, and Crosschain-Hill, are still pointed out. On the North side of the hill, a little below where the Hospital stood, is a fountain of excellent water, called Trinity Well, and which was formerly much resorted to. On the West of the Hospital, is a small House and offices, with a property of between three and four acres, be longing to a person ofthe name of Pringle, which is said to have been a gist 4P2"], [676, "S P E from King James the Fifth, for a nights' lodging, when he was separated from his companions on a hunting party : this small property has continued ever since in the same family, without addition or diminution.

This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth ; comprehend ing a fertile Lowland district, and part of the hilly district of Lammer-Muir. Agriculture is much attended to here. The Salary of the Schoolmaster is 300 merks Scotch, with the usual School-fees, and perquisites. The poor are main tained by the interest of \u00a3200. Sterling, and 400 merks Scotch, mortified by Lord Alexander Hay, of Spott, together with the weekly collections. The Pa rochial Records contain the following extract, which shows the horrid effects of Superstition, so late as the beginning of the Eighteenth Century: \u2014 \" October 1705, Many witches burnt on the top of Spott loan.\" The edges of Lammer- Muir are beautifully skirted with natural wood. Spott House, the residence of Robert Hay, Esq., is romantically situate upon a rock, in a low glen, surrounded with beautiful pleasure grounds. St. John's Well, an excellent spring, is car ried in pipes two miles, for the supply of water to the inhabitants of Dunbar. Kisthill Well was formerly resorted to for scorbutic complaints. Spartlelon Hill"], [678, "S P R is one of the highest in Lammer-Muir. Partly in this Parish, and partly in that of Dunbar, is Down Hill, which is remarkable for being the place where General Leslie had his camp, before, what is sometimes called The Battle of Dunbar, but in general in this neighbourhood, Tlie Battle of Dozen Hill : here Cromwell was victorious, and many of the slain were buried in and about Spott-dean Spott was anciently a Prebend in the Collegiate Church of Dunbar. The Muir land Farms are intersected by a large Common, called Dunbar Common, which is said to be the property ofthe Town, the Parish, or the Presbytery of Dunbar, but is promiscuously pastured on by the sheep belonging to the contiguous farmers. SPOTTISWOODE, v. GORDON, and WEST STRUTHER. SPRINGFIELD, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Graitney. It is 4 m. W. from Longtown. In the year 1791, a newr Village was begun on the Farm of Springfield, belonging to Sir William Maxwell. It is regularly built, and is situate on a dry, healthy soil, upon an eminence on the Western bank ofthe river Sark, which is here the boundary of The United Kingdom : the building leases are for 99 years : and, in 1793, it contained upwards of forty houses; since which time, it has greatly increased, owing to the many advan tages which it possesses with respect to its situation. Both coals, and peat, are plentiful, and at a moderate price : there is a small river contiguous to the village, which is well adapted for the erection of machinery : and the Sea-port town of Sark-foot is not above a mile distant from it. The great Roads, from England by Moffat to Edinburgh and Glasgow ; by Dumfries to Port-Patrick ; and by Dumfries, and Sanquhar, to Glasgow, all pass through this Village. SPRINGKELL, v. KIRK-CONNEL. SPRINGWOOD PARK, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Kelso. It is \u00b1 m. S. W. from Kelso. This is a small, but elegant Seat of Sir George Douglas, Bart. SPROUSTON, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerlva Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, including the glebe, was \u00a3172.: Patron, The Duke of Roxburgh : The Church, and manse, were built about the year 1791. It is in the Presbytery of Kelso, and Synod of Merse and Teviot dale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the ancient Parish of Lempit- Laic) was 1105, and, in 1811, was 1199. It is 27 m. N. E. from Kelso. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 4 milies in breadth : That part which lies along the side of the Tweed, is flat and very fertile, but is"], [679, "SPY liable to be overflowed ; the Southern part is more elevated, but not hilly ; and no part can be said to be unproductive. Agriculture is greatly improved here. Coals, the only fuel, are brought from the County of Northumberland. The Roads are bad. The Regality of Sprouston comprehended a large tract of land, in the East ofthe Shire of Roxburgh : In the 14th century, the Lands of Moll, Aldtown-Burn, and of Black-Dean, were included in this Regality, though it was nine miles distant. In 1747, The Duke of Roxburgh claimed \u00a31000. as a compensation, on its abolition. The Barony of Sprouston was granted by Robert the First to his son Robert Bruce ; and David the Second gave the Barony of Hawick, and Sprouston to Thomas Murray. SPYNIE, or NEW SPYNIE, in the Shire of Elgin : formerly a Rectory and Prebend, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 64 bolls of bear, \u00a330. Sterling, and 60 merks for Communion elements : Patron, The Duke of Gordon : The Church, which is dedicated to The Holy Trinity, was, together with the manse, plea santly situate at the Eastern extremity ofthe Parish, in the vicinity ofthe Castle, until the year 1736, when they were removed to Quarrytcood, a more central, though more bleak situation ; both of them are at present in tolerable repair ; and the glebe, and garden, consisting of about 6 acres, are both substantially inclosed with stone walls ; the burying-place is still at Spynie. It is in the Presbytery of Elgin, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 843, and, in 1811, was 816. It is 2\\ m. W. b. N. from Elgin. The Loch of Spynie, which has given name to this Parish, is more than three miles in length, and about one mile in breadth : it bounds the Parish along its North side, and appears to have been a Firth of the Sea, though it is now shut up by a long extent of valuable land at each end, both on the East and West. Accordingly part of the Country, between the Lake and the Sea, still retains the name of Ross Isle ; and there is a place near its Western end, called Kintrae, i. e. The Head ofthe Tide. It appears, from the Chartulary of Moray, that, in the Thirteenth Century, small boats were sent from the Village of Spynie to fish in the sea ; in testimony whereof, a heap of shells, collected by the fisher men, was lately discovered, under a thin covering of earth, on the site where Old Spynie originally stood. It also appears, from the Chartulary, that, in 1451, the Bishop of Moray got this Village erected into a Burgh of Barony, and the next year into a Burgh of Regality ; but there is now no other vestige of it than a Market Cross. But, although it is evident, that, at a period compara tively not remote, the sea flowed into the space which the Lake now occupies"], [680, "SPY and covered also a large extent of land at each end of it ; yet, it is also obvious, that, at a still more recent period, the bounds of this lake were more limited than at present : for, a few years ago, when the Canal, which had long been neglected, was cleaned out and enlarged, a Causeway was discovered, stretching from this Parish quite across the Lake, in which there were several passages for the water, each about three feet wide, and covered by a thick flag-stone ; and upon its appearance, a Tradition was recollected, that this Causeway was called The Bishop's Steps, and had been formed by his influence, for the accommoda tion ofthe Ministers of St. Andrew's, who officiated also in the Church of Ogston ; and that the Bishop's Priest read prayers in the Forenoon in the one, and in the Afternoon in the other, and afterwards dined in the Castle every Sunday. This Causeway was soon converted by Mr. Brander, of Pitgaveny, into a substantial road, by which a more direct communication was opened between Elgin and the shore: and as he is now farther improving the Canal, so as to gain nearly two feet of additional fall, it is expected, when this work is completed, that the Lake will be again reduced to its ancient narrow limits : It abounds with wild Swans during winter ; which Fordun remarks as a curi osity ; and in it are also perch and trout. A great part of this Parish lies plea santly along the banks of the river Lossie, within view of Elgin, including Auchter Spynie, called also Upper Haugh, Morayston, called, in 1378, Middle ! Haugh, (then feued by the Bishop to John Dallas, son of William Dallas, of Strathardel), and Wester Haugh, now called Borough-Bridge. It is about 4 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth ; a ridge of moor stretches along its whole extent, rising gradually towards the West into a pretty high hill, and is cloathed almost throughout with thriving plantations of fir, interspersed with other Forest trees: On the South side of this ridge, is a large extent of very flourishing natural Oak wood, the property of The Earl of Fife : and under a thin stratum of moorish soil, the whole of this ridge seems to be a mass of excel lent, hard free-stone ; of which there is a Quarry, near its summit, that supplies a gipat portion ofthe Country with mill-stones, and the Town of Elgin, and the Neighbourhood, with stones for building. On each side of this ridge lies the whole of the cultivated land, in which almost every variety of soil is to be met with, from the heaviest clay to the lightest sand. The Climate is healthy. The whole Precincts ofthe Bishop's Palace, which do not exceed 10 acres, are now the property ofthe Crown, and are let by the Court of Exchequer to the Earl of Fife, at an annual Rent of \u00a312. Sterling. The remainder of the Parish is divided"], [681, "S T A among five Heritors ; \u2014 The Earl of Fife holds all the lands in the North and West, except the Estate of Westfield, which is the property of Francis Russell, Esq. of Blackball, Advocate ; \u2014 The Earl of Seafield holds the lands of Borough-Bridge (about 40 acres), lying between the river Lossie and the Town of Elgin ; as well as the lands of Greenhall, Myreside, and Bishop-Mill, in the East, between Spynie and Elgin; \u2014 James Miln, Esq., having only the Mills of Bishop-Mill, with a small contiguous property; \u2014 And, the Lesslies, of Findrassie, have long possessed that estate, on the side ofthe Lake, between the properties of the two Earls. Coals may now be had at a moderate price. The Scottish is the prevailing language. On the hill of Quarrywood, are the re mains of a Danish Camp. Spynie is a dormant Barony in the family of Lind say, a younger branch of the Earls of Crawford. Here was the chief Palace ofthe Bishops of Moray ; this Edifice stands on a rising ground, on the South bank ofthe Loch of Spynie, and when entire, is said to have been one ofthe most magnificent Episcopal Palaces in Scotland. In 1590, Sir Alexander Lindsay, Son ofthe Earl of Crawford, was created Lord Spynie ; whose Grandson dying in 1760, without issue, the lands reverted to the Crown, and were granted to Douglas, of Spynie; from whom the Barony was purchased by James Brodie, late of Whitehill ; and is now the property of James Brodie, his Grandson. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of this Palace. STABLETON, CASTLE, v. DORNOCK. STACKS of DUNCAN'S BAY, off the Coast of Caithness ; and in the Parish of Canisbay. These are two pyramidal pillars of naked free-stone, which rear their fantastic summits into the air, and strike the eye of a stranger on ap proaching them, as the huge spires of some old Gothic pile. During the season of incubation, they are frequented by prodigious numbers of sea-fowls, which nestle about their sides ; while the Eagle sits in Royalty upon their summits. STAFFA, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : It constitutes part ofthe Parish of Kill-Ninian. This Island is about 5 leagues West from the Isle of Mull, and 3 leagues North-North-East from I-Colm-Kill. Its form is oblong and irregular, about one mile in length, and half a mile in breadth : its coasts are steep and craggy ; the sides being entirely bare, exhibiting superb basaltic columns, and hollowed by various caverns. It is accessible only by a small entrance on the West side, where the surface slopes towards the sea ; but which will only admit a small boat, and that in the calmest weather. The most elevated part of the Island, is over the vol. ii. 4 Q"], [682, "S T A Cave of Fingall, where it is 214 feet above the sea, at ordinary tides. Near the middle of the Island is a wretched hut, inhabitated during the summer by the Herdsman and his family, who take care ofthe cattle which are pastured here. More than one-half of the circumference of the Island is occupied by grand and regular colonnades of basaltes, which are completely exposed by the sea ; the rest of the Island exhibits the same basaltic appearances ; but the pillars are bent and twisted in various directions; some lying nearly horizontal, and others forming segments of circles. They generally rest on an irregular pavement, formed of the upper sides of those pillars that have been broken off, which extends in a sloping direction as far under water as the eye can discover. Here the forms of the pillars are apparent ; these are of 3, 4, 5, and 7 sides ; but those of 5 and 6 are most prevalent. They are of various diameters, from the extent of a foot to four feet and a half. The surfaces of the large pillars are rough and uneven, full of cracks in all directions ; the pillars arc jointed, and the upper surface of each joint is generally concave, having a corresponding convexity in the inferior surface of the other ; but the reverse of this is often noticed, and many of the pillars exhibit a plain surface. In some places, the interstices, between the perpendicular prisms, are filled up with a yellow sparry matter, composed of the oxyd of iron, separated from the basaltes, and a little argilla ceous earth, with some specimens of zeolitic crystals. The pillars near the landing place are small, but increase in magnitude as they are nearer the Cave of Fingall, the greatest natural curiosity ofthe Island. \" The impatience which every body felt,\" says The Right Honourable Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., K. B. (the Illustrious Naturalist, who first described this grand and striking characteristic, with a degree of philosophy and accuracy that obtain the highest commendation), \" to see the wonders we had heard so largely described, pre vented our morning's rest ; every one was up and in motion before the break of day, and with the first light arrived at the South-West part of the Island, the seat of the most remarkable pillars ; where we no sooner arrived than we were struck with a scene of magnificence which exceeded our expectations, though formed, as we thought, upon the most sanguine foundations ; the whole of that end ofthe Island supported by ranges of natural pillars, mostly above 50 feet high, standing in natural colonnades, according as the bays or points of land formed themselves ; upon a firm basis of solid unformed rock, above these, the stratum which reaches to the soil or surface ofthe Island, varied in thickness as the island itself formed into hills or vallies ; each hill, which hung over the"], [683, "S T A columns below, forming an ample pediment ; some of these above 60 feet in thickness, from the base to the point, formed by the sloping of the hill on each side, almost into the shape of those used in architecture. Compared to this, what are the Cathedrals or the Palaces built by men ! mere models or playthings, imitation as diminutive as his works will always be when compared to those of Nature ! Where is now the boast ofthe architect ! regularity, the only part in which he fancied himself to exceed his mistress, Nature, is here sound in her possession, and here it has been for ages undescribed. Is not this the School where the art was originally studied, and what has been added to this by the whole Grecian School? a capital to ornament the column of Nature, of which they could execute only a model ; and for that very capital they were obliged to a bush of Acanthus : how amply does nature repay those, who study her won- derful works ! \u2014 With our minds full of such reflections we proceeded along the shore, treading upon another Giant's Causeway, every stone being regularly formed into a certain number of sides and angles, 'till in a short time we arrived at the mouth of a cave ( The Cave of Fingal), the most magnificent, I suppose, that has ever been described by travellers. The mind can hardly form an idea more magnificent than such a space, supported on each side by ranges of co- lumns ; and roofed by the bottoms of those, which have been broken off in order to form it ; between the angles of which a yellow stalagmitic matter has exuded, which serves to define the angles precisely ; and, at the same time, vary the colour with a great deal of elegance, and to render it still more agreeable, the whole is lighted from without ; so that the farthest extremity is very plainly seen from without, and the air within being agitated by the flux and reflux of the tides, is perfectly dry and wholesome, free entirely from the damp vapours with which natural Caverns in general abound.\" This wonderful work of Nature is 53 feet wide at the entrance, 117 feet high, and 250 feet long : the arch is composed of two unequal segments of a circle, which form a natural pediment : the mass which crowns, or rather which forms the roof, is 20 feet thick at its lowest part. The bottom of the Cave is filled with the sea, reaching to the very extremity; in very calm weather, a boat may sail into it ; but, if this should be attempted when the waves are agitated, though only in a very small degree, the boat would inevitably be dashed to pieces against the sides ofthe cavern. The only way of entering at such times, is by a Causeway not more than two feet broad, on the Eastern side, formed by the bases of broken pillars, which is exceedingly slippery, being constantly washed 4Q2"], [684, "S T A by the Spray. Besides the Cave of Fingal, there is another which exhibits the same appearances, though on a less scale : it is situate on the North side ofthe Island, in the midst ofa magnificent colonade, and is named in Gaelic Ua-na scarve, i. e. The Corvorants Cave. The basaltic pillars of Staffa are all magne tic ; the lower parts possessing a North, and the upper parts a South Polarity. This celebrated Island has since been visited by many curious and ingenious men, who all concur in its being \" undoubtedly the greatest natural curiosity in Europe, if not in the world.\" \u2014 This Island is the property of Ronald Macdo nald, Esq., Advocate, and Sheriff-Depute of the Shire of Stirling; and who was lately married to Miss Stewart, of Allanton. See, Mull, Isle. STAFFOLD, v. LANGHOLM. STAGE-HALL, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of Stow. It is 24 m. S. S. E. from Edinburgh, and 364 m. N. b. W. from London. A Gene ral Post-Office is established here. STAGS, The, v. DURNESS. STAIR, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr: formerly a part of the Parish of Ochiltree, and erected into a separate Parish in 1653 ; the Stipend, in 1811, being 3 chalders of victual : no manse : Patron, The Earl of Stair : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery cf Ayr, and Synod of Glas gow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 663, and, in 1811, was 614. It is 4\\ m. S. W. from Mauchline. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, lying between the rivers Ayr and Kyle . The soil is in general a deep clay, except on the banks of the rivers, where it is loamy ; and the whole is inclosed, and well cultivated. Coals are abundant: and, on the lands of Dalmore, antimony, copper, and plumbago or black lead, have been discovered, and a species of whetstone, well known by the name of\" The Water of Ayr Stones.\" The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Considerable plantations have lately been made here ; especially on the estates of Stair, the seat of General Stuart, \u2014 Barskimming, of Lady Miller, of Glen-Lee, \u2014 Drongan, of Mungo Smith, Esq., \u2014 and, Gadgirth Castle, of Mr. Steel. Stair gives the title of Earl, Viscount, and Baron to the Ancient and Noble family of Dalrymple. STANLEY, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parishes of Auchtergaven, and Redgorton. This is a considerable Village, erected on sues from The Duke of Athol, in the year 1784. Here is an extensive cotton manufactory. Stanley House, which is beautifully situate on the banks of the river Tay, was built by"], [685, "S T E the late Lord Nairn. The family of Nairn had another elegant house near Loak, the ruins of which are yet visible : their place of interment is in the South Aisle of Auchtergaven Church. Here is a private School. STAPLE GORDON, in the Shire of Dumfries : an ancient Parish, now comprehended in the Parishes of Langholm, and Wester-Kirk : The Church yard here is still in use. It is 2 m. N. N.W. from Langholm. See, Langholm. STAXIGOE, in the Shire of Caithness : and in the Parish of Wick. This is a small fishing village, with a harbour for boats, on the estate of Sir Benjamin Dunbar, Bart., of Hempriggs. STEIN, in the Isle of Skyfe, and Shire of Inverness : in the Parish of Kill muir. This is an improving Village on the North-West coast ofthe Island, es tablished by The British Fishery Society. Under the auspices of The Par liamentary Commissioners, an excellent road has been made to this village, from the head of Loch Sligichan by Loch Bracadale and Dunvegan, a distance of 30| miles. It is the property of Macleod. STEITIL, FOREST, v. LOTH. STEMPSTER, LAKE, v. LATHERON. STENNESS, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shet land : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Firth. It is in the Presbytery of Cairston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 640, and, in 1811, was 566. The Mainland, toward the West, is intersected from South to North, to the distance of nearly five miles, by the Loch of Stenness: which, near the middle, is almost divided into two parts, by the plains on each side stretching out, and nearly meeting with each other : they are connected by a kind of causeway, which leads to the large circle. These plains are pleasantly situate in the bosom ofthe Loch, and in the centre of an immense amphitheatre ; in the area of which, are the Parishes of Stenness, Harra, and Birsa. Its limits are the hills of Orphir, Rendal, and Sandwick, and the majestick Hills of Hoy, which toward the South, lye at a much greater distance, and bound the prospect. The plain, on the West side ofthe Loch, contains a circle sixty fathoms in diameter, formed by a ditch on the outside, twenty feet broad and twelve feet deep ; and, on the inside, by a range of Standing Stones, twelve or fourteen feet high, and four broad : several of them are fallen down, of others fragments remain, and of some only the holes in which they stood : the earth that has been excavated from the ditch, has been carried away, and very probably been made use of to form four Tumuli or Barrows, of"], [686, "S T E considerable magnitude, which are ranked in pairs on the East and West side of this remarkable monument of Antiquity. The Plain, on the East border of the Loch, exhibits a semi-circle, sixteeu fathoms in diameter, formed not, like the circle, with a ditch, but by a mound of earth, and with stones in the inside, like the former in shape, though of much larger dimensions. Near the circle there are Standing stones, which seem to be placed in no regular order that we can now discern ; and near also to the semi-circle, are others ofthe same de scription. In one ofthe latter is a round hole, not in the middle, but towards one of the edges, much worn, as if by the friction ofa rope or chain. Toward the centre ofthe semi-circle, also, is a very large broad stone now- lying on the ground ; but whether it stood formerly like those around it, or has been raised and supported on pillars to serve a particular purpose, cannot now be determined. The common people still attach much veneration to the stone with the circular perforation ; isa lover and his mistres join hands through it, this is considered as the sign of a vow of the most sacred kind ; it is called The Promise of Odin. The more superstitious ofthe natives also are of opinion, that if, in their youth, they pass their heads through this hole, they will never be afflicted with palsy. STENNESS, ISLE, one of the Shetland Isles ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of North-Maven. This Holm and Isle are situate to the South-West, and abound with kitty-icakes ; which fill every projection and every hole, that can possibly afford them shelter. STENRIES HILL, v. WAMPHRAY. STENTON, in the Shire of Hadington : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150.: Patron, William Nisbit, Esq. , of Dirlton : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dunbar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 620, and, in 1811, was 685. It is 4\\ m. S. W. from Dunbar. The Inland part of this Parish is about 3^ miles from North to South, and 3 miles from East to West ; and is so called, because a narrow stripe of muiry ground stretches Southward into Lammer-Muir, to the distance of about 10 miles from the Church, and is there bounded by the river Whittadder. The soil is exceed ingly various ; it lies mostly upon free-stone and gravel ; and the greater part is inclosed. For several ages, this Parish was called Petcoks, from the name of a Village, a mile and a quarter North-East from Stenton : but, the stony qua lities ofthe soil have since induced the Inhabitants to denominate this District, Stenton. It was formerly a Prebend in the Collegiate Church of Dunbar."], [687, "S T E STEVENSTON, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patrons, Mr. Hamilton, of Grange, and Mr. Cuninghame, of Sea-bank, by turns : The Church is old. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. Tne Re sident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including part of the Town of Slit coats) was 2146, and, in 1811, was 2911. It is 4 m. N. W. from Irvine. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth, stretching along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, which is here flat and sandy : in the interior, the soil is mostly clay, and abundantly fertile. The climate is dry and salubrious. Coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, of excellent quality, are in great abundance. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a house, and garden. There are several seats of the residing proprietors ; the chief of which are those of Alexander Hamilton, Esq., of Grange ; R. Cun inghame, Esq., of Sea- Bank; and of Patrick Warner, Esq., of Ardeer. The old ruinous Castle of Kerrila, now the property of the family of Hamilton, of Grange, formerly belonged to, and was inhabited by The Earl of Glencairn. STEVENSTON, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Hadington. This is a beautiful Seat, at the distance of 2 miles East from Hadington. It is situate on the South bank ofthe river Tyne. STEWARTFIELD, in the District of Deer, and Shire of Aberdeen : in the Parish of Old Deer. This is a populous Village, built upon the estate of Mr. Burnett, of Denns : who, in 1783, established a bleach-field in its neighbour hood, for the encouragement of its linen and yarn manufactures. STEW ARTON, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in toler able repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, Mr. Cuninghame, of Lainshatc : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Popula tion of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2657, and, in 1811, was 3049. It is 61 m. W. S. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the last Friday, O. S., in April, the last Tuesday, O. S., in May, the last Thursday, O. S., in June, the last Tuesday, O. S.. in July, and the first Friday after the 12thof November, and the first Thursday thereafter. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the water of Annoch, and may vie with any Town of its size in the West of Scotland for the beauty,"], [688, "S T I regularity, and cleanliness of its streets, aud houses. The principal manufacture is that of bonnets. This Parish is upwards of 10 miles in length, and, in some places, about 4 miles in breadth. The general appearance is flat, with a gradual descent towards the sea: the soil is mostly a strong clay, and arable, and it is generally inclosed. Very extensive Plantations have lately been made here. The climate is rainy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. There is plenty of lime-stone, but no coal. Near the Town, are the foundations of a House, said to have been a Seat of one ofthe Royal race of Stewart, from which the Parish derives its name. STICHEL, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 600 merks in money, and 6 chal ders of victual, one-half payable in bear, and the other in in-field oats, Lin lithgoic measure, together with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, one-half of which is paid by The Earl of Marchmont, and the other by Sir James Pringle, Bart. : the glebe of Stichel consists of about 5 Scotch acres, and the glebe of Home of between three and four English acres ; the Parish of Home, in the Shire of Berwick, having been annexed to that of Stichel, in order to augment the modern Stipend : Patron, The Crown: The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Kelso, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthe Parish of Stichel, in 1801, was 506, and, in 1811, was 522. It is 4 m. N. b. W. from Kelso. Stichel is supposed to take its name from its elevated situation, the Church, and Village, being placed on the commanding brow of a steep hill ; and most part of the Parish is 600 feet above the level of the river Tweed at Kelso. The united Parishes are between five and six miles from South to North, and between three and four miles from East to West. A considerable portion of the land is a strong soil : in some places it is wet, and cold ; but the tenants are particularly studious in its improve ment ; and nearly the whole is inclosed, and mostly in tillage. The cattle in the Parish of Stichel are of a larger size than the generality of cattle, North ofthe Tweed ; owing to the late Sir Robert Pringle, who had, for sev eral years, a supply of Dutch Bulls. The Barony of Stichel, and the Barony of Home, each maintain their own Poor. There is a deed of mortification of \u00a3100. Sterling, by a Captain Robert Home, of the regiment of Foot for merly commanded by Colonel Roger Handyside ; one half of the interest of which is annually distributed at Christmas to poor Householders in the Village of Home; and the other half to the Schoolmaster of Home, for teaching poor scholars who are natives of that Village. The water of Eden separates the"], [689, "S T I Parish of Stichel from that of Nenthorn, for about a mile and a half, and, in its course, forms a beautiful cascade. Lime, and coals, are brought from the County of Northumberland, and are exceedingly dear. Stichel- House, is the elegant residence of Sir James Pringle, Bart. See, Home. STIRK'S, ISLAND, v. EDDERACHYLIS. STIRLING, anciently STRYVELING, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Stirling : This Ecclesiastical charge was made Collegiate in 1651 ; the Stipend ofthe First Minister, in 1811, being \u00a3150., which is paid out of the Teinds, and collected by the Town, in conse quence of an agreement between the Minister and Town to that effect ; he has also a manse, which was bequeathed by Colonel Edmond, during the Seven teenth century : the Stipend ofthe Second Minister, in 1811, was \u00a3110., which is paid by the Town, from an impost on the malt ground at the Town mill ; he has no manse : The Chaplainry of the Castle, procured through the interest of the Town, is vested in the First Minister only, during life: Patrons, The Town Council: The West Church, of very beautiful architecture, was erected about the year 1494, for the accommodation of some Observantine Friars, who were settled in a Convent, almost contiguous to it, by James the Fourth : The East Church, the present place of Worship, was erected by Cardinal Beaton, and is a more splendid and magnificent fabric. It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling, The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including 15 persons in the Gaol) was 5271, and, in 1811, was 5820. It is 35f m. W. b. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The Market is on Friday, and is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Friday in February, the last Friday in May, the first Friday in August, the third Friday in September, the first Friday in November, and the second Friday in December. The situation of the Town is very romantic, being seated on the sloping ridge of a rock, the precipitous end of which, towards the West, is occupied by the Fortress. The great Street, on the sum mit ofthe hill, is broad and spacious, with elegant houses ; but the other Streets are narrow and irregular. Sterling, according toBoETHius, gave name to Sterling money, because Osbert, a Saxon Prince, after the overthrow ofthe Scots, estab lished here a Mint: this etymology would, however, seem to be a mistake, as Sterling money is said to be derived from the Merchants of the Easterlings. This Town was also anciently called Striveling ; as is said, from the frequency of strifes or conflicts in the neighbourhood ; and from this old name, the present appellation seems to have been derived. It is a place of great antiquity ; but vol. ii. 4 R"], [690, "S T I many ofthe Charters of the Town having been lost during the invasions of the English and the Civil wars, in all of which Stirling made a conspicuous figure, it is not possible to trace its early importance. Stirling, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Inver-Keithing, Dunfermlin, Culross, and South Queen's- Ferry, sends one Member to Parliament. It was one ofthe Curia quatuor Bur gorum; a Court which gave rise to the present Convention of Royal Boroughs. The Municipal government consists ofa Provost, 4 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, 7 Merchant Counsellors, and 7 Deacons of Trade. Besides the ordinary Jurisdiction in Civil cases, which is common to the Magistrates of all Royal Boroughs, the Magistrates of this Town have also an extensive criminal Jurisdiction conferred upon them by their Charters, equal to the power of Sheriffs within their Territories. There is a pecidiar Bye-Law of this Corpo ration, made in 1695, which the Members ofthe Council must annually take an Oath to observe ; originating in a liberal and independent spirit, and which, from its salutary tendency, deserves to be followed by other Corporate Bodies : by this Oath they bind themselves, to take no lease of any part of the Public property under their management, nor to purchase any part of it ; neither to receive any gratification out ofthe Public funds, under pretence ofa reward for their trouble, in the transaction ofthe affairs ofthe Borough, or of the Hospitals founded in it. By the same Bye-Law also, A Board of Auditors for inspecting the Public Accompts is annually elected, consisting of two Members, who are chosen by the Merchants at large, and two by the seven Royal Incorporations. Stirling being situate on the Isthmus, between the Forth and Clyde, is, by means of its Bridge, the great thorough-fare ofthe North of Scotland. It is the Seat ofthe Circuit Court of Justiciary, for the Western Circuit ; the only Gaol in the County is here ; and here also the County Meetings are usually holden. In the Council Chamber is kept the Jugg, appointed by law to be the Standard of dry measure in Scotland. The Grammar-School, which has long been celebrated for its able masters, is conducted by a Rector, and Usher : there is also a writing school, two established English teachers, and a teacher in Allan's Hospital, permitted by the Town : the annual Salary of the Rector is \u00a340., and a house ; those of the other teachers are from \u00a320. to \u00a330. Sterling. A manufacture of Shalloons has long been carried on here ; and there are also carpet, and cotton Manufactories. Coals are plentiful. Here are three Private Banks, besides a Branch of the Old Bank of Scotland. The Salmon Fishery, belonging to the Town, is very productive. There are Three Hospitals ; the First of which, endowed by Robert Spittal, Tailor to King James the Fifth, about the year"], [691, "S T I 1530, is for the support and relief of poor tradesmen, and has a yearly rental of \u00a3221., from lands in the neighbourhood of Stirling :\u2014 the Second, sounded and endowed by John Cowan, Merchant, in 1639, for the support of 12 decayed Guild Brethren, has an Income in lands of \u00a31158. Sterling .-\u2014and the Third, founded by John Allan, Writer, in 1725, for the maintenance and education ofthe Chil- dren of decayed tradesmen, has a yearly rental in land of \u00a3298. Sterling. There are also various other Charitable Foundations, which are honourably and impar- tially conducted. Near to the walls ofthe City, was a Monastery of The Domi- nicans, which was founded by King Alexander the Second, in 1233 : in this Church was interred an Impostor, who, at the instigation of The Countess of Oxford, assumed the character of Richard the Second : after his retreat, he found here an honourable support to the day of his death. The Church of The Observantines is a very handsome building, in the best style of Gothic architec- ture : This Church is noticed in History as the place where, in 1543, The Earl of Arran, Governor during the reign of Queen Mary, publicly renounced the Reformed Religion, which he had once professed to favour : it was also here that King James the Sixth was crowned in 1567. On the North side of this Church, stands a ruinous building, of superb workmanship, called Marr's Work, having been erected by John Earl of Marr, who was a short time Regent in the Minority of James the Sixth : the stones, with which it was built, were brought from the Abbey of Cambus-Kenneth, the revenues whereof were at that time holden in Commendam, by that Earl's near relations : many of the stones have been carried away to build walls and other erections at the New Church-yard, at St. Ninian's. On the right hand of the road leading to the Castle, stands a spacious edifice, which once belonged to a Noble family ofthe name of Alex ander, who took the title of Earl from this Town : it was afterwards in pos- session ofthe Family of Argyle, by whom it was lately sold; it is now consi- derably out of repair, and is let in different tenements. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of the Church. \u2014 The Castle is undoubtedly of great antiquity, but when it was first built, is not known : The natural strength ofthe Rock upon which it stands, especially before the use of artillery, must have always made it a desir able fortress. It was occasionally the residence ofthe Scottish Kings, but not a fixed Palace, until the Family of Stewart mounted the Throne : itwas the place of Nativity of James the Second, who often resided at it after his coronation ; and here he perpetrated the murder of Wtilliam Earl of Douglas, in 1552, whom he stabbed with his own hand : the Royal apartments were then in the 4 R 2"], [692, "S T I North-West corner ofthe Castle, and are at present the residence ofthe Fort- Major, and partly occupied by the Armoury : the closet where the murder was committed, still goes by the name of Douglas's room. James the Third took particular pleasure in this Castle, and added several new buildings to it : he built a lame Hall, now called The Parliament House, in which several Parlia ments have been holden : he also erected The Chapel Royal, which he largely endowed, and procured to be made Collegiate, for a dean, sub-dean, sacristan, chanter, treasurer, chancellor, arch-dean, sixteen chaplains, and six singing boys, which, with the chaplains and a rnusic-master, were appointed by the King : The Queen's Confessor was the Dean, who had Episcopal Jurisdiction. This Chapel was pulled down by James the Sixth, who, on its site, erected the present Chapel. James the Fifth was crowned here, and here he resided during his Minority, and received his education : he built the present Palace, a singular Edifice, richly ornamented with grotesque figures ; and which contains many large and elegant apartments : the ground floor has been converted into barracks for the private Soldiers ; and the upper story supplies a house for the Governor, and lodgings for the Officers. Opposite to the Palace, is a Chapel of hewn stone, built by James the Sixth for the Baptism of Prince Henry, in 1594 ; and which is now employed as a Store-room. A strong Battery was erected about the year 1559, during the Regency of Mary of Lorraine, called The French Battery: In the reign of Queen Anne, the Castle was enlarged and repaired, and a flanking Battery, named Queen Anne's Battery, with barracks and a Bomb Proof, were erected on the South side : since that period, no alteration or repairs of any consequence have been made. Adjoining to the North side ofthe Castle, is an eminence containing a few acres, which, being fortified, makes a part ofthe Castle : it is called The Nether Bailey, and here is the Well which supplies the Garrison. On the South-West side ofthe Castle, is The Park, inclosed by a stone wall ; this, with several other pieces of ground round the Town, form a Jurisdiction, called The Constabulary of the Castle. At the East end ofthe Park, was a Royal garden ; and vestiges of the walks and parterres are still visible. The Lordship, and Castle of Stirling, were the usual Dowry ofthe Queens of Scotland, at least after the Accession ofthe Stewarts. It has been the scene of many warlike exploits, having been repeatedly besieged, taken, dismantled, and re-built by different parties, during the wars between the English and the Scotch, as well as in their Civil dissensions. In the winter of 1746, it sustained a memorable siege, when the gallant old officer, General"], [693, "S T O Blakeney, baffled all the efforts of The Rebels to reduce this important fortress. About 36 guns are mounted on the ramparts : it is commanded by a Governor, Deputy-Governor, Fort Major, and three Subalterns ; and it is one ofthe Scot tish Forts, which, by the Articles of The Union, are always to be kept in repair. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of this Castle. \u2014 The Parish of Stirling is chiefly confined to the Town : its whole extent not exceeding 200 acres. The Castle, with the Constabulary, are not reckoned in the Parish of Stirling ; nei ther are the Royal Domains or King's Park ; these being exempted from all Parochial assessment, and are in the Parish only quoad sacra, and that only since the Chaplain ceased to officiate, or to reside in the Castle. The Land ward part of the Parish lies between the Town and the Forth ; extending along the South side ofthe river, from Killdean, about a mile above the bridge of Stirling, to the East ofthe Town, with some Parks on the South of it. These lands are rented, on an average, at 50s. per acre. The Shore of Stirling is within the Jurisdiction ofthe Custom-house of Alloa. STIRLING, SHIRE. This was formerly a part ofthe Shire of Lennox. Its medium length is about 44 miles, and its breadth 16 miles ; containing 358,336 acres Scotch, the only land measure used in the Shire. The general appearance is greatly diversified by rivers, mountains, woods, and vallies, which exhibit a number of views extremely pleasing and picturesque. The soil, especially to wards the East, is rich and fertile ; but the moors are principally appropriated to pasturage. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 50,825, and, in 1811, was 58, 174. It sends one Member to Parliament. Here are various remains of Roman antiquities. STOBHALL, v. CARGILL. STOBHALL, v. HOB-KIRK. STOBHILL, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of Crichton. It is 3^ m. N. from Middleton. Here is a Colliery, which belongs to the Lord Chief Baron Dundas. STOBO, or STOB -HOW, in the Shire of Peebles : formerly a Rectory and Vicarage, anciently called The Parsonage of Stobo \u25a0 it appears from the original rights of Lord Wigtown, once Patron of this Parish, that it was a Parsonage, having four Churches belonging to it, which were called The Pendicles of Stobo, viz , The Church of Dawick, Upper and Lower Drummelzier, Broughton, and Glen-Holm : Dawick is now annexed to Stobo and Drummelzier, and what was called, in the original rights of Lord Wigtown, Upper Drummelzier, is now"], [694, "S T O a distinct Parish, and is called Tweeds-Muir Parish; the Stipend, in 1811, was \u00a349..8..10-f Sterling, and 60 bolls of victual payable partly in meal, and partly in bear : besides which the Minister receives from Sir James Nasmyth 10 bolls of meal, which are converted at the Mid- Lothian fiars, being the rent of one half of the glebe and Grass of Dawick, that was annexed to Stobo, in 1742 : the manse is in good repair: the glebe consists of 21 English acres, which are all inclosed, and subdivided with stone walls and quickset hedges ; the greatest part of it having been inclosed by The Rev. Alex ander Ker, at his own expense : Patron, Sir James Montgomery, Bart, : The Church of Stobo is a Gothic build ing, and is said to be between four and five hundred years old. It is in the Pres bytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 338, and, in 1811, was 422. It is 6 m. S. W. from Peebles. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and from three to four miles in breadth. The greater part ofthe Parish is mountainous, and fit only for sheep pasture ; the other part is arable, and capable of cultivation. Some of the Hills are green to their summits ; but most of them are covered with heath. The soil ofthe arable land is exceedingly various ; but a light fertile loam, upon a bed of gravel, is the most prevalent. The situation is dry ; and the Climate is healthy. It is intersected by the river Tweed. Here is a Common, called The Sheriff Muir, so denominated from having been the place where the Tweeddale Militia assembled, during the animosity that prevailed between the two Kingdoms : it is a flat, uncultivated heath, with many monumental stones upon it, which pro bably point out the scene of some battle, that neither History nor Tradition have handed down to us ; upon this heath, is a large round cavity, called Pinkie's hole. Here are two Quarries of excellent slate, of a dark blue colour, with which most of the Houses of The New Town of Edinburgh are covered. The Salary of the School-master is 300 merks, besides School-fees, and perquisites, and a comfortable house. The great inconvenience under which the inhabitants of this Parish labour, is the scarcity of fuel. The High Road which runs through this Parish, and which is commonly called Stobo Hedges, from its being bounded on each side by a hedge for some miles, was completely made some years ago. The roads that join it, on the West and East, have also been made of late years. The Statute labour is commuted. There is no Turnpike in the Parish. There are two Bridges over the Water of Lyne, which is the boun daryon the East be tween this Parish, and those of Newlands, Lyne, and Peebles : one of them was built by contribution within these few years ; the other, though an old"], [695, "S T O Bridge, is very sufficient, and renders an easy access between Stobo, and Peebles. The Bridge which was lately built over the Water of Lyne, was in consequence of a road being made along the side of Lyne Water, that joins the Peebles road upon the East, and the Kirk-Urd road upon the West : this road is iu good repair, and is of great advantage to travellers coming from the West country by the way of Peebles. There is also a Bridge over Biggar Water, which is the boundary on the West between Stobo and Glen-Holm : this Bridge opens up a free com munication between Stobo, and the road leading to Moffat. The Mansion of Stobo, is a seat of Sir James Montgomery, Bart., son of the late Lord Chief Baron. New Posso is the residence of Sir James Nasmyth, Bart. See, Dawick. STOBS, v. CAVERS. STONEFIELD, v. KNAPDALE, NORTH. STONEHAVEN, in the Shire of Kincardine ; and in the Parish of Dunottar. It is 107^ m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. A General Post-Office is established here. This Town is situate at the confluence ofthe river Carron w-ith the German Ocean ; and is capable of being made an excellent harbour, at a small expense. It consists of two considerable Streets, built on feus granted by the Earls Marischal, within whose estate it was situate. It is a Burgh of Barony, of which the Jurisdiction is vested, by Charter, in Magis trates who are chosen by the Superior and feuers. Of late, a spirit of trade has manifested itself; and the brown linen manufacture has been introduced. The Resident Population, in 1792, was 1072. One of the principal supports of the Town has been derived from the Sheriff Court of the County, which was removed by Act of Parliament from Kincardine to this place, in 1600 : here also is the County Gaol, and where the County Courts are holden. The public reve nue of Stonehaven consists chiefly of the shore dues, amounting annually to about \u00a345., in which there has been a very great increase of late years, from the quan tity of lime brought by sea, for the improvement ofthe lands in the neighbour hood : another source of revenue arises from four fairs in the year, and some small patches of ground, which produce together about \u00a320. more. The Town is sup plied with excellent water, conveyed in leaden pipes, and the streets are well paved. Coals are the general fuel. It is in the Latitude of 56' 58' North, and the Longitude of 1\u00b053' West. STONE HOUSE, v. LARBERT, and CARRON.

The cod fishery in the Irish Channel is pursued with various success through the whole season, but none is exported ; and abundance of mackerel are taken in the Bay of Luce. The Roads are in good repair. Here are two Parochial Schools, with a Salary of 300 merks to each, together with a few School-fees, and a house and garden. The climate is healthy.

The Bay of Float, on the Irish Channel, is so called, from the circumstance of some vessels ofthe Spanish Flota having been wrecked there ; and at Money Point, near it, many Dollars were afterwards found. At Ardicell, is also a Bay on the Irish Sea ; and on the lands there, are some remains of Druidical Temples, and Pictish Castles. STORE, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Assint.

The Roads are tolerably good. The Climate is healthy. The Bishops of St. Andrews had a Regal Jurisdiction over the whole district of Wedale : and they often resided at The Stow of Wedale, from whence they dated many of their Charters. On the settling ofthe Border Laws, in 1249, it was stipulated, that Tlie Presbytery of Wedale should swear for the King of Scotland, and the Bishop of St. Andrews. Old John Harding, the Chronicler, when he was instructing the English King how to ruin Scotland, advises him, folio 237., \u2014 \" To send an hoste of footmen in, At Lammesse next, through all Lauderdale, \" And Lammermore woodes, and mossis over-rin, \" And eke therewith, The Stow of Wedale.\" \u2014 STRACHAN, properly STRATHAEN, in the Shire of Kincardine : for merly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a389. .9..

This Parish is situate on the North side ofthe Grampian Mountains, extending from the top ofthe Cairn O' Mount to the banks of the river Dee, about 11 miles, and comprehending 40,230 English acres ; of which, not more than 3000 are arable, and tolerably fertile. Over the Cairn O' Mount is an excellent Road, well accommodated with Bridges, which lays open the communication from the Southern to the Northern and Eastern parts of Scotland, and the resort of travellers along it is very considerable. The altitude of the highest of the Grampian Mountains, within this Parish, was by a late admeasurement found to be, Kirloack 1890 feet, Mont-Battack 3450 feet, and Kloachnabane 2370 feet, above the level of the sea; and on the summit of the last, is a large rock, accessible only on one side, commonly called The Stone of Kloachnabane, which is a Land mark for ships at sea. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. It is well supplied with peats, and turf. Game is abundant. The rivers Feuch, and Dye, which take their rise in the Grampians, unite about a quarter of a mile above the church, and fall into the Dee about two miles below it : both these streams afford excellent diversion to the Angler. Blackball is the elegant and commodious Mansion of the late Francis Russell, Esq., who made very considerable plantations around it. The Com- missioners for Highland Roads and Bridges in their Third Report of July 1807, state, \" in January 1806, a Memorial was transmitted to us, calling our attention to a proposed line of road over the Grampian Mountains, on the con- fines ofthe Counties of Kincardine and Aberdeen. It was described as extend- ing from Clattering Brigs Northward, across the Grampian Mountains, to a ruin- ous bridge over the river Feuch at Whitestone , being a distance of about 12 miles, and as far as the Jurisdiction of the Magistrates of the County of Kincardine extends. We willingly directed a Survey of this Road to be made; and soon afterwards we received an application from The Earl of Aboyne, requesting that the Survey might be extended about 8 miles further Northward from Whitestone Bridge aforesaid, to a junction with the Turnpike road leading from Charlestown of Aboyne to Aberdeen. Mr. Brown, of Elgin, received instructions to survey this proposed extension, together with the rest of the road; but other engage- ments not permitting him to undertake it immediately, another Surveyor was re- commended by Mr. Russell, of Blackball, the most zealous promoter of this road : But we are sorry to announce, that the sudden death of Mr. Russell appears"], [701, "S T R to have stopped all proceedings, it being uncertain whether the other Proprietors, deprived of his assistance, will think fit to persevere in their intentions.\" STRACHUR, anciently KILL-MAGLASS, in the District of Cowal, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Strath-Lachlan united, in 1650 ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 7 chalders and \\ boll of meal, and \u00a3231.,6..8. Scotch in money : the manse was built in 1780 : the glebe consists of 15 acres of very bad land : Patrons, Campbell, of Ardkinglass, and Donald Maclachlan, Esq., of Maclachlan, alternately : There is a Church in each Parish, at the distance of 6 miles from each other, in which the Minister officiates alternately. It is in the Presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of the Parish of Strachur, in 1801, was 646, and, in 1811, was 689. It is 9 m. S. S. W. from Cairndow7. The United Parishes are situate in the District of Cowal, and are about 18 miles in length, and from 3 to 8 miles in breadth ; stretching along the South-East bank of Loch Fyne, and watered by the river Chur, which is subject to frequent inundations, and falls into Loch Eck. The general appearance is hilly, affording excellent pasture for sheep and black cattle ; but there are considerable fields of arable land on the banks of the Lakes, and the sloping sides of the hills are finely covered with wood, both natural and planted. The climate is pure and healthy, but very rainy. In the hills are some remarkable Caves ; and the remains of ancient Watch-Towers, and a Druidical circle near Strachur House. Personal services are almost totally abolished : the principal estates in the Parish are freeholds : the lesser estates hold of The Duke of Argyle, to whom a small feu-duty is paid. There are two Parochial Schools, one at each ofthe Parish Churches, but the Salary for both is only 300 merks. The Gaelic language is universally spoken here. Fuel is expensive. Strachur Park, an elegant modern Mansion, ' built by the late General Campbell, of Strachur, whose predecessors lived occa sionally in the parish of Loch- Goil-Head, at a place called Ardgartan, where they had a large property, and which still continues in the family. This family is reckoned by Macfarlane the most ancient of the name of Campbell ; but another account makes Arthur, the first Laird of Strachur, to have been de scended from the family of Argyle, in which the present Laird seems to acqui esce, by taking, with a mark of Cadetcy, the arms and livery of the family of Argyle, after they had been quartered with those of Lorn. The Laird of Strachur has always been accounted, according to the custom of the Highlands, the Chief of the Clan Macarthur. By a Memorial presented to The Com-"], [702, "S T R missioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in the month of July 1804, by His Grace The Duke of Argyle, The Right Honourable Lord Fincastle, General John Campbell, of Strachur, Donald Maclachlan, of Machlachlan, Esqrs., and William Maxwell Morrison, of Glen- Shelish, Esq., it appears, \" That several new roads are now executing under your direction, which will open an useful and easy communication from the Western parts of the Shire of Inverness, and the Northern parts of the Shire of Argyle, and the numerous Islands on that coast, with Fort William, from whence there is an excellent road to Inverary. \u2014 But, from Inverary travellers have at present no road by which they can reach Greenock, except either by going round by Glasgow, a distance of eighty-four miles, or travelling by Dumbarton, a distance of forty-four miles, and hiring a boat from thence. \u2014 From the length of this line of road, and the state ofthe country, it is extremely difficult to procure horses, or any means of conveyance, the usual resource being to order Post-Chaises from Glasgow or Dumbarton, which always creates a delay of some days. \u2014 To do away these difficulties, your Memorialists propose that a road be opened from Strachur on Loch Fyne, to Ardintenny or Loch Long, a distance of only Thirteen miles, by wdiich the traveller, instead of a tedious and expensive journey round by Glasgow and Dumbarton, will be able to make out this part of his journey in six or seven hours. This road will also be of great use to the important Herring Fishery on Loch Fyne, by affording the Fishermen easy access to the best market for pur chasing nets and other stores, and for sending their fish to be sold in the Towns upon the Clyde.\" \u2014 This important road was accordingly undertaken in terms of the Act, and was finally inspected and approved in October 1809. \" We have the satisfaction to learn,\" say The Commissioners, \" that the road is already very useful to the Public, and to render it more so, We shall readily listen to any application for its extension Southward to Portinstock Ferry, a distance of four miles.\" In their Fifth Report, of April 1811, The Commissioners observe, \" no application for the desirable prolongation ofthe South end of it has yet been made ; but The Earl of Dunmore having proposed to contribute towards a Bridle-road from Loch-Goil-Head, the Southern termination ofthe Ardnoe road, to Ardintenny, the Southern termination of the Strachur road, We shall cause the Survey to be continued to Portinstock, not without hope that such an exten sion may be hereafter adopted.\" STRAGEATH, v.

STRAITON, in the District of Carrick, and Shire of Ayr; formerly a"], [703, "S T R Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 88 bolls of victual, two-thirds payable in meal, and one-third in bear, \u00a353..18..2y in money, and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse was built in 1753, and is in bad repair : the glebe, and garden, consist of 8 acres of good land : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1026, and, in 1811, was 1069. It is 6 m. S. E. from Maybole. This Parish is 15 miles in length, and about 5 miles in breadth. The surface is mountainous, and is principally appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The village of Straiton is delightfully situate in a vale, watered by the river Girvan : it was built by Thomas Earl of Cassillis, on a neat and uniform plan, and is one of the most beautiful Highland villages. The climate is very temperate, and healthy. There is a great deal of natural wood ; and, around Whites ord, the Seat of Sir John Whiteford, Bart., are several extensive plantations. Coals, lime, marl, free stone, aud iron-stone, are in abundance. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with a good School-house, and fees. Upon a little Island in Loch Doon, a beautiful piece of water 9 miles in length, are the remains of a Castle, which now belongs to The Earl of Cassillis. In Loch Braden, there is also an Island, with the remains ofa Castle upon it. By old leases it appears, that Sir James Cunningham, a former proprietor ofthe Barony of Dal morton, now the property of Sir Adam Ferguson, bound his tenants very remark ably, \" to attend his Baron Court, at the Cairn, in the holm of Dalmorton.\" STRALOCH, v. MACHAR, NEW. STRANRAER, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of The Rhyns, and Shire of Wigtown : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 6 bolls of meal, at 16 stones, and 280 merks, payable by The Earl of Stair, out of different Parishes, 12 bolls of meal, and 60 merks, out of Garthland, in the Parish of Inch, 440 merks by the Town of Stranraer, and \u00a373..19..6*y by Parliamentary augmentation: Mr. Walter Laurie, formerly Incumbent here, left some Parks in the neighbourhood, and a house in the Town, which was rebuilt in 1761, to his successors for ever, to supply the want of a glebe, and manse ; these Parks are about 30 acres ; they hold of Robert Vans Agnew, Esq., and pay \u00a33..11..1\u00a3, as feu, and teind: the Minister has also a right to the Vicarage teind of the herrings taken in Loch Ryan, by the Inhabitants ofthe Town, and Clayhole, at the rate of the Twentieth herring ; but tins depending upon a subject so precarious in itself, and so difficult"], [704, "S T R to be levied, is never productive, and does not yield above 10s. per annum: Patron, The Crown : The Church was re-built in an elegant, and commodious style, in 1785. It is in the Presbytery of Stranraer, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1722, and, in 1811, was 1923. It is 126 m. SW. b. S. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Friday in May, the last Friday in August, and the last Friday in October. A General Post-office is established here. It is pleasantly situate at the Eastern extremity ofthe Bay of Loch Ryan, Jind has an excellent natural Harbour, called The Road, where ships of 300 tons burden can anchor in safety, about half a mile from the Town : but vessels of 60 or 100 tons fre quently anchor close by the houses. It is a Royal Borough, of considerable anti quity ; and is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, a Dean of Guild, and 15 Counsellors. It is the Seat of a Presbytery of the same name, and the chief Town of that District of Galloway, called The Rinns or Rhyns. Many elegant Houses have lately been built here ; and a handsome Town-House and Prison, adds greatly to the appearance ofthe place. It is a Port ofthe Custom-House, of which all the maritime Parishes of The Rinns are members : besides the coasting trade, and fishery, some of the largest vessels have lately gone annu ally to the Baltic. The manufacture of coarse linen, and tanning, are carried on to a considerable extent here. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. Stranraer, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of New Galloway, Whitehorn, and Wig town, sends one Member to Parliament. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a very convenient School-house ; the whole amounting to from \u00a340. to \u00a350. per annum. The report from the Presbytery states this to be a Royal Burgh, having no Landward Parish. The land contiguous to the Town, on the East and South, is in the Parish of Inch, and belongs to The Earl of Stair ; that on the South-West, and West, belongs to Mr. Vans Agnew, and is in the Parish of Leswalt. The great Road, from Carlisle to Port-Patrick, leads through the Town ; along which the Mail-Coach from London goes daily; and a Diligence from Ayr to Port- Patrick passes thrice a week. All the principal Roads are in good repair. The old Castle of Stranraer is now uninhabited : and, not far from it, is the Castle of Culhorn, the noble residence ofthe Ancient and Illustrious Family of Dalrymple, Earl of Stair. STRATH, or STRATH SUORDLE, in the Isle of Skye, and in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a383..6..8."], [705, "S T R Sterling, 32 bolls of meal, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements: no manse: Patron, The Crown : There are three different places of Worship, but only one Church, which was formerly a Popish Chapel : at two of those Religious sites, the Minister preaches at the side ofa hill, when the weather is fair ; when it is stormy, he officiates in one of the Tenant's huts, to as many persons as it can contain. It is in the Presbytery of Skye, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1748, and, in 1811, was 2107. It is about 19 miles in length, and 5\\ miles in breadth, lying on the Sound which separates Skye from the Mainland : it also comprehends the two small Islands of Pabay, and Scalpa, which lie to the East of it, and are distant about two thirds ofa mile. The middle ofthe Parish is flat, but the greater part is hilly. and covered with heath : and several of the hills exhibit volcanic appearances. The soil is in some parts clay, in others black loam, but by far the greater part is mossy. There is abundance of lime-stone, and marl ; and some marble of an inferior kind. The air is moist and foggy, and more rain falls here than in any other part of Skye. About 100 tons of kelp are manufactured annually. The Harbours are Broadford Bay, Loch Slapan, Loch Eynart, and The Sound of Scalpa, where vessels of any burden may anchor in safety. Lord Macdonald, and Mr. Macalister, of Strath- Aird, are the only two Heritors, The Salary of the Parochial School, including the School-fees, is about \u00a322. per annum. Here are several Danish Forts. In that District of the Parish, called Strath- Aird, are numerous Caves ; in one of which the Pretender lodged for some nights, in 1746 ; and another is remarkable for the numerous beautiful stalactical in crustations and petrifactions which it contains. The language spoken here is tbe Gaelic. Peat is the only fuel. Two Trysts for cattle are holden in this Parish annually, on the last week ofthe months of May, and July. There is an excellent Ferry (on the Post-road from Inverness to this Island) at Kyle Rhea, the Eastern extremity of the Parish. Salt is often a scarce commodity here: and a great quantity of meal is yearly imported. The Roads through the Parish are going on with spirit, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commis sioners. Coriatachan, the residence of Mr. Mackinnon, is pleasantly situate between two brooks, with one of the highest hills of the island behind it ; and here Dr. Johnson was elegantly entertained by the worthy and hospitable Pro prietor, in 1773.

It gives the title of Baron to The Earl of Aboyne, and was the paternal Estate of the Chief ofthe great Clan of Gordon. STRATH-AVON, or AVONDALE, anciently Evandale, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 10 chalders of victual, \u00a350. in money, and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements : The manse is a ruinous building, the repairing of which has been litigated for years, and is now under Appeal in The House of Lords : the glebe was originally 4 acres, and two roods, besides 2 acres of grass ground, given by Ann Duchess of Hamilton in the year 1654: Patron, The Duke of Hamilton: The Church was removed from its ancient site in the Church-yard in the year 1772, and re-built where it now stands, and is in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery of Hamilton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. Tbe Resident Popu lation of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 3623, and, in 1811, was For the Town of Strath- Avon. - 2439. For the Country District. - - 1914. 4353. The Town of Strath- Avon is pleasantly situate on the banks of a rivulet called Pomilion, which falls into the Avon about a mile below, and is 44 miles S. W. from Edinburgh, 16 m. S. E. b. E. from Glasgow, and 7 m. S. b. W. from Ha milton. It was erected into a Burgh of Barony in the year 1450, with the usual privileges, and had an extensive Commonty; all of which has long ago become private property. It has a Weekly Market, and a General Post-Office ; and Fairs are holden on the first Thursday in January, the first Thursday in March, the last Thursday in June, the last Thursday in July, and the first Thursday in November. Having no public funds, it has no other Magistracy than a Baillie of Barony, appointed by The Duke of Hamilton. The principal manufacture is that of cotton, which employs a great number of looms. The Salary ofthe Pa rochial School is 400 merks, together with School-fees, and Candlemass offer ings, a school-room, dwelling-house, and small garden : Besides this there are two private Schools in the Town of Strath- Avon, and from three to four in the"], [707, "S T R country district, one of which has a small endowment. \u2014 The Parish and Barony of Avondale is about 12 miles in length, and from 5 to 6 miles in breadth. The soil is various : on the banks of the Avon, it is in many places light and gra- velly, in some clay and loam, and, in others, deep moss, which is now found to be an excellent manure for light and clay lands ; and considerable tracts of moss have been converted into corn fields, which at first were laboured with the spade, but now with the plough. The hilly part is black moor, covered with heath and coarse grass, but which may be brought into cultivation by being laid down with Fioringrass. The air, though moist, is not unwholesome. The Duke of Hamilton is Patron ofthe Church, Titular ofthe Teinds, Proprietor of about 11,400 acres, and Superior of all the lands in the Parish, except a very small portion of Temple Land, which is holden of Lord Torphichen. We have no ac- count of this parish prior to the year 1333, when it was laid waste by an English army, after a battle fought on the confines ofthe Shire of Ayr, near Loudon Hill. It was anciently a part of the estate of Douglas, which being forfeited in the reign of James the Second, continued in the hands ofthe Crown until tbe year 1456, when it was erected into a Barony in favour of Andrew Stuart, grandson of Murdoch Duke of Albany, who was at that time created Lord Evandale, and made Warden of the East Marches towards England. He built, or rather repaired and enlarged, the Castle of Evandale; and, upon the accession of James the Third, was made Chancellor of Scotland. Andrew, second Lord Evandale, having a feud with some of the neighbouring Barons, and wishing to live at a distance from them, exchanged the Barony of Evandale with Sir James Hamilton, of Finnart, for the Barony of Ochiltree, in the Shire of Ayr, in the year 1534; which was ratified by an Act of Parliament in 1543, and Andrew Steuart allowed the style of Ochiltree, with the precedency of Evandale. By the imprudence of Sir James Hamilton, the Barony of Evandale soon came into the possession of his brother, The Earl of Arran, and has continued in the family of Hamilton ever since. The Castle of Evandale stands upon a rocky eminence at the Town of Strath Avon, near the rivulet Pomilion above mentioned. This, and the Castle of Arran, were alternately the residence of Anne, Duchess of Hamilton, during the Usurpation of Oliver Cromwell : That worthy Lady always remembered the attachment shewn by her Tenants and Vassals in the days of her adversity, and continued to pay an annual visit to this place, until she was prevented by the infirmities of old age : she died in the year 1716, after which the Castle of Evandale was no longer kept in repair. On the South side 4T2"], [708, "S T R side ofthe river, a Roman Road maybe traced for several miles ; and there are Chapels named after different Saiuts, where it is probable that the Clergy be- longing to the neighbouring Priory of Lesmahagoe, occasionally performed Di- vine Service for the benefit of the inhabitants, before this District was erected into a separate Parish. At Drumelog was a rencounter (being what Mr. Hume calls the battle of Loudon- Hilt), on Sunday the first of June 1679, be- twixt the Covenanters and a party of dragoons, under the command of Captain Graham, of Claverhouse, afterwards Viscount of Dundee, in which the latter were defeated, and would have been entirely cut to pieces, had it not been that the Covenanters scrupled to sight, except upon the defensive, on the Lord's day. The turnpike road, betwixt Edinburgh, and Ayr, runs the whole length of this Parish, from North-East, lo South-West : and is crossed at the Town of Strath- Avon by the turnpike road betwixt Glasgow and Dumfries, by Muirkirk, and Sanquhar. The Avon, next to the Clyde, the largest river in the County, rises in the South-West extremity ofthe Parish, and running in a North- East direction towards the Clyde, falls into that river at Hamilton-Bridge. There are three bridges over it in Avondale ; the first of which was built by Ann, Duchess of Hamilton, about the beginning ofthe Eighteenth century ; the second, on the road to Lanark, in 1721 , and the third in 1770 : but they are all too narrow. There is abundance of lime-stone, and some coal, in the Parish ; but free-stone is rather scarce. STRATH BEG, v. KILL-DONAN.

Sterling, in money : Patron, The Duke of Montrose : The Church is a mean building. It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 734, and, in 1811, was 795. It is 10 m. N. b. W. from Glasgow. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth. The general appearance ofthe country is agreeably picturesque : in the Valley, the land is exceedingly fertile, and beautified by several neat villas : to wards the North, the hills are partly cultivated, and partly covered with heath, which afford excellent pasture for black cattle, and sheep. The Hill of Dum goiack, towards the West, on the Duntreath estate, presents a singular and strik ing appearance ; insulated in the middle ofthe Valley, ofa conical figure, and completely clothed with wood, it forms an interesting scene ; whilst a cliff of the opposite hill, projecting like a pedestal, directs the eye, as it were, through an"], [709, "S T R immense vista to the plains below, where the prospect is bounded by the lofty Mountains on the side of Loch Lomond. It is watered by the Blane, which sig nifies, the warm River ; aud upon its banks three Bleach-fields have lately been erected, but it is subject to sudden inundations. The air is peculiarly mild, and healthy. The superiority of this Parish is vested in The Duke of Montrose, and Sir Archibald Edmonstone, Bart., of Duntreath, whose ancestors formerly pos sessed the whole property of it. In the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, that part of it which belonged to the estate of Montrose was chiefly feued out : the Cas tle of Mugdock, and the Park adjoining, being alone retained in the Family. The Castle and Estate of Duntreath, formerly one of the greater Baronies, and in right whereof the Proprietors sat in the Scottish Parliament without election, or patent, still constitutes about a third part of the Parish. The ancestors of this Ancient and Illustrious family were twice allied to the Royal Family of Scotland ; their last marriage into it being between Sir William Edmonstone, and Mary Countess of Angus, daughter of Robert the Third and Sister to James the First: this Princess lies buried in the Church of Strath Blane: the present Sir Archibald is lineally descended from both of these Illustrious alliances. This Parish is intersected with good Roads in every direction. The hills, which form the Northern boundary of the Parish, constitute part of that range anciently known by the name of The Lennox Hills, and which extend from Dumbarton to Stirling ; in former times, that Noble Family had vast possessions in this part of the country, and the district itself was denominated Lennox. In the moor land part ofthe Parish are six small Lakes, which abound with pike, perch, and trout. Here is an extensive Print-field. STRATH-BOGIE, a District in the Shire of Aberdeen. This Lordship was one ofthe five Divisions of the Shire of Aberdeen, anciently called Thanages, and comprehending the whole original estate which King Robert Bruce gave to the Illustrious family of Gordon, ancestors ofthe Duke of Gordon. It extends over a surface of 120 square miles, including the arable and uncul tivated land, and lying on each side ofthe river Bogie, which discharges itself into the Deveron at Huntley : which Town, from that circumstance, was formerly denominated by the same name, and it is still the chief Town of the Lordship. STRATH-BRAN, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Lao-an- Aulachy, which is now united to the Parish of Little Dunkeld. This Valley is. about 9 miles in length, watered by the winding river Bran, and is a populous."], [710, "S T R district. In a plain on the banks of the Bran, three miles above Little Dun keld, are the ruins ofthe Castle of Trochrie, formerly one ofthe seats of the Noble and unfortunate family of Gowrie : some parts of the walls are yet stand ing, wrhich indicate the ancient magnificence of the structure. When the lands of that ill-fated house were forfeited, Trochrie, and the whole extensive Barony (or, as it is in some writs called, Lordship) of Strath-Bran, was granted by Royal Munificence to William Stewart, of Banchrie, a gentleman ofthe Bed chamber to King James the Sixth. He was brother to Sir Thomas Stewart, of Grandtully, from whom he inherited the patrimonial estate of that ancient and respectable Family ; and had attained the honour of Knighthood him self, before his brother's death. A stone Bridge over the Bran, a little above Trochrie, is reckoned among the oldest in the Shire of Perth. Near a sine cascade on the river Bran, The Duke of Athol has built an elegant Summer house.

This Parish is about 20 miles in length, and from 7 to 8 miles in breadth, occupying the head of the Valley in which the river Don pursues its course to the German Ocean. It was formerly named Inver-Nochtie, from the situation ofthe Church, which stands at the confluence ofthe Nochiie with the Don. Upon the banks of the rivers there are considerable patches of arable land ; but the general appear ance ofthe country i s hilly, and covered with heath, affording pasture to large flocks of sheep, and shelter to abundance of game, especially on the hills of Curgarff, which are much resorted to by sportsmen. The Salary of tbe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood of land : Besides which, The Society for propagating Christian"], [711, "S T R Knowledge have established two Schools in the Upper Districts. Granite, lime stone, and slate of a coarse quality, are now in great abundance. The roads are indifferent. The Castle of Curgarff, on the great Military road from Edinburgh to Forth George, issupposed to have been a Hunting-Seat of The Earls of Marr, and was burned inl571 by the Gordons, during the feuds between that family and the family of Forbes ; it was afterwards repaired, and, in 1746, purchased by Government to accommodate a small Garrison ; but for several years past, it has been inhabited only by a Corporal's guard of Invalids.

At the Dissolution of Religious Houses, this Priory with all its Revenues and Superiorities, was given by the King to Campbell, of Glenurchay, ancestor to The Earl of Breadalbane, iu whose possession it still remains. This place is famous for a Sacred Pool, near the Chapel, which is esteemed highly sanative in almost every disease, but espe cially madness: and a Bell, which was formerly placed with great solem nity upon the heads of unhappy persons afflicted with that dreadful malady, has for some years past been locked up, to prevent its being applied to superstitious uses. A Missionary is now established here, with a Salary of \u00a350.

It was afterwards exchanged by the Eleventh Earl of Marr, for the estate of Alloa, which was then in possession of the Crown, having been forfeited by Baliol, the unsuccessful competitor for Royalty. STRATH GLASS, in the Shire of Inverness : partly in the Parish of Kill morack, and partly in the Parish of Killtarlaty. It is 9| m. S.W. from Beauly. It is intersected by the river Glass, the lands on the North side, called The Chisholms Lands, being in the Parish of Killmorack ; and those on the South side, belonging to the Parish of Killtarlaty. In this Strath, little corn is pro duced, but there is a great deal of good pasture. Erchless Castle, the tint Seat ofthe Chief ofthe ancient and powerful family of Chisholm, is surrounded with a rich and well cultivated estate. By a Memorial presented to The Commis sioners for Highland Roads and Bridges by the great Land Owners in Sep tember 1804, it appears, **' That the utility ofa line of road from the North side ofthe Beauly Firth, and Post Town of Beauly, to the West Coast of Scotland, was so obvious to The Honorable The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, that some years since their Lordships ordered Mr. Brown, of Elgin, to survey the same ; it is a line of road which the Memorialists believe will be of the greatest utility to the Public and the Nation at large ; and they are desirous it should be proceeded in with all convenient speed. Yet it is not improbable, but the changes which have taken place in the price of labour and materials, may occasion, though not a new survey, a revision of that already in possession of Parliament, and in which the unquestionable merits of that line of road, and its utility for Commercial purposes, and for opening a direct communication between the East and West coast are evident, and are so well known to the Natives, that it is the line they already practise in their inland traffic to Beauly, Redcastle, Kessock, and Inverness, and embraces the interest of Ross as well as the Shire of Inverness, and which the natives now pass at all seasons ofthe year"], [713, "STR from their public Markets of the West to the East coast.\" The entire' extent of this line of road, as surveyed by Mr. Brown, reaches from Beauly through Strath Glass and Strath Affarick, to Shiel House at the Southern extremity of Loch Duich on the West Sea, a distance of 48^ miles. But, as part ofthe pro posed road lies in the Shire of Ross, a survey and estimate has been made of a portion ofthe Strath Glass road in Inverness, extending no less than 23\u00a3 miles to Wester Knock Fin, which, it is hoped, will be speedily effected, as it will be highly beneficial to an extensive tract of improvable country. Knock Fin also being not more than ten miles distant from the Bridge of Doe, on the Glen-Mo riston road, these two roads may probably be hereafter connected; and by such a junction, will afford an additional communication with the Isle of Skye. STRATH-GRYFE, v. RENFREW, SHIRE. STRATH-HALLADALE, v. REAY. STRATH IRE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Callander. This Vale extends along the Eastern bank of Loch Lubnaig. STRATH ISLA, v. KEITH. STRATH-LACHLAN, anciently KILL-VORRIE, in the Shire of Argyle: an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Strachur : Divine Service is per formed here alternately with Strachur. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 433, and, in 1811, was 440. It is 11 miles S. b.W. from Inverary. Machlachlan, the seat of Donald Machlachlan, Esq., is an elegant building, near the old Tower of Castle Lachlan, and in the centre of a noble estate, 1 1 miles in length, and at an average a mile and a half in breadth, stretching in one continued line along the Eastern side of Loch Fyne. The name of the Parish is partly derived from Lachlan, a family of considerable distinction among the Highland Clans, and whose residence has been in Strath-Lachlan for time immemorial. The Representative of this ancient and respectable Family is Chief ofthe Clan Lachlan. STRATH-MARTIN, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Mains united in 1795 : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 30 bolls of barley, 32 bolls of meal, and \u00a326.. 14.. 7. Sterling, with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, were built in 1775 : the glebe consists of the legal extent : Patrons, The Crown, and Admiral Laird, of Strath- Martin : The Church was rebuilt in 1779. It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 503, and, in 1811, was 627. It is 4m. N.N.W. from Dundee. This Parish is vol. ii. 4 U"], [714, "STR about 2 miles square, lying in the pleasant and beautiful vale which is watered by the river Dighty. The surface is pretty level ; and the soil is light, and sandy. The climate is healthy. Here are some Quarries of excellent free-stone. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a School, and dwellin0-, lately built on a small piece of ground which was taken from the Church-yard, with the consent of the Presbytery. On the AVest side of Clatto Muir, are the vestiges of an ancient camp, which is generally believed to have been occupied by Agricola's army, and afterwards by the forces of Sir William Wallace, and General Monk. This Parish is the property of Admiral David Laird, of Strath- Martin, who has erected an elegant modern House, On the site of the old Castle; \u2014 and of Walter Ogilvie, Esq., of Tullidelph- Hall, now called The Bank; both of whom have inclosed, and greatly improved their estates. STRATH-MIGLO, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : the manse is in good repair : Patron, The Earl of Mansfield : The Church was lately re-built. It is in the Presbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1629, and, in 1811, was 1697. It is 3f m. N. W. from Falkland. This Parish is about 5\\ miles in length, and 3^ miles in breadth, and is watered by the small Burn of Miglo, one of the tributary streams of the river Eden. The surface is partly flat, and partly hilly: a considerable portion is inclosed, and the whole is well cultivated. The air is often moist, but not unhealthy. is abundance of free-stone. Coals are the common fuel. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The West Lomond Hill, 1700 feet high, being the loftiest ground in the County, is in the South Corner of the Parish, and presents a very bold precipitous front to the North : it contains several strata of sand-stone, red, dark grey, and white, intermixed with whin-stone, and lime stone of various qualities. Pitlour House, the of the Skenes, of Hallyards, is situate below the brow of a hill behind the Village, and commands an exten sive prospect of the Vale of Eden. STRATH-MORE, v. DURNESS. STRATHMORE, i. e. THE GREAT VALLEY, a name applied to that extensive Plain which traverses the Kingdom from Stonehaven, in the Shire of Kincardine on the East, to the District of Cowal, in the Shire of Argyle, on the West. It is bounded by the Grampian Mountains on the North, and on the"], [715, "STR South by the Sidlaw, Ochil, and Lennox Hills. The whole Valley is fertile and pleasant, and is interspersed with numerous Towns, Villages, and elegant Seats. Strathmore gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Bowes, one ofthe Sixteen Peers for North Britain, in the Imperial Parliament. General Roy, pi. 20. has given a map ofthe East part of Strathmore, which is supposed to have been the scene of the last military operations of Agricola in Britain. STRATH NAVER, v. FAR. STRATH PEFFER, or CASTLE LEOD, v. FODDERTY, and CRO MARTY. STRATH SPEY, a District, in the Shires of Inverness, and Elgin. It is remarkable for its extensive Forests of Fir ; the property of The Duke of Gordon, and The Earl of Seafield. STRATH STEVEN, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Golspie. It is a small Village, situate on the German Ocean. STRATH TILNEY, v. KILL-DONAN. STRATHY HEAD, and BAY, v. FAR. STRATYRUM, v. ANDREW'S, ST. STREINS, The, v. ARDCLACH. STRELITZ, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Cargill. It is 3 ra. S. S. W. from Cupar of Angus. This is a neat, pleasant Village, and is so named in honour of Her Majesty. It was built in 1763, by The Commissioners for managing the Annexed Estates, and was intended as a comfortable place of residence, for the discharged Soldiery at the conclusion of the German war. Here is a School, originally established by The Commissioners, but since con tinued by The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, with a Salary of \u00a35., together with a free house, and some other perquisites, which the Master is allowed by Mr. Drummond, of Perth, the Proprietor of the village : his fees are much the same as those in the Parish School, with this difference, that he is obliged to teach poor scholars gratis. This School is regularly visited, and examined by a Committee of Presbytery. STRICHEN, in the District of Deer, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly part ofthe Parishes of Rathen, and Fraser's-Burgh, but erected into a separate Parish, in 1627; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 55 bolls 2 firlots 1 peck 2\\ lippies of meal, 15 acres of laud, and \u00a362..8..9| in money: the manse is in good repair : Patron, Alexander Fraser, Esq. : The Church was built in 1627. It is in the Presbytery of Deer, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this 4U2"], [716, "STR Parish, in 1801, was 1520, and, in 1811, was 1760. It is 154| m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The weekly Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the last Thursday, O. S., in Febru ary, the last Tuesday, O. S., in April, the second Tuesday, O. S., in May, the first Tuesday, O. S. iu July, the second Tuesday, O. S. in August, and tltte first Tuesday, O. S. in November. The Village, which is pleasantly situate on the Northern bank ofthe Stricken, a tributary stream oftheUgie, is principally inhab ited by weavers, and other industrious tradesmen, and is in a thriving state. This Parish contains about 8000 acres : nearly the whole of which belong to Alexander Fraser, Esq., whose elegant House of Stricken is surrounded by extensive Plantations, made by the late Lord Strichen, one of the Senators of the College of Justice ; and where there were trees of sufficient size to attract the attention of Dr. Johnson, who observes, \" 1 had now travelled 200 miles, and had only seen one tree not younger than myself; but at Strichen, Mr. Fraser showed us in his grounds some stones yet standing of a Druidical circle, and w-hat I began to think more worthy of notice, some Forest Trees of full growth.\" \u2014 The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a very neat house, and a glebe of 8 acres, which were given to the Master by the late Lord Strichen. The Roads are good. Peats are in great plenty. Here is an excellent lime Quarry. STRICKATHROW, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly the Church of the Chantor of the Cathedral of Brechin, to which the Parish of Dunlappie was united in 1618: the Stipend, in 1811, being \u00a3583.. 8. .9. Scotch in money, 13 bolls of oats, 47 bolls 2 firlots 2 pecks of meal, and 47 bolls 2 firlots and 2 pecks of bear : the manse was built in 1748 : two glebes, one of 5 acres, and the other of 3 acres at Dunlappie, at the distance of two miles from the manse : Patrons, The Crown, and The Earl of Kintore : The Church was re-built in 1791. It is in the Presbytery of Brechin, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 593, and, in 1811, was 580. It is 5 m. N. from Brechin. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching across the Valley of Strathmore. The surface, which rises at each extremity, is uncommonly pleasant : the soil varies from a rich clay, to a black gravel : the hills are covered with heath. Very little of the Parish is inclosed ; but, upon the whole, considerable attention is paid to agriculture. The air is generally dry, and wholesome. Here are extensive Quarries of lime-stone, which is burnt with coals, brought from Montrose. As this Parish produces"], [717, "STR scarcely any peats, the fuel chiefly used is turf, and broom. The Public Roads are in good repair ; but the Private Roads are exceedingly bad. The Church yard of Strickathrow is noted for having been the scene of the abject surrender ofthe Crown of Scotland by John Baliol to King Edward the First in 1296. STROM, CASTLE, and FERRY-TOWN, v. LOCH CARRON. STROMA, ISLAND, off the Coast of Caithness ; and in the Parish of Canisbay. It is situate in the Pentland Firth, about a league from the shore. This is a low Island, about a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth, and con tains 170 Persons. It is very productive in corn ; but the Inhabitants are obliged to supply themselves with fuel, from the mosses on the Main-land. The tenth sheaf was heretofore taken in part payment ofthe rent; but this, with all other customs and services, have lately been converted by the present Proprietor, at the desire ofthe Tenants, into money: and it now rents at about \u00a3120. Sterling per annum. The sea is one of their principal sources of support : and from their political situation, and the simplicity, sobriety, and industry natural to them, there are perhaps few Islanders more happy than those of Stroma. They have a Society School in the Island, and they go very regularly by sea to Church, when the weather allows them to cross the Sound. On the West of the Island, is a vast cavern or glupe, at about 30 yards from the beach : it stretches down to a level with the ocean, whose waves are seen pouring into it, by a narrow openino at the bottom : and it is often exceedingly tempestuous around the Island in the Winter months. The coast on the West is very bold. The tremendous elevation ofthe billows, that beat against it during a storm, from that quarter, exceeds all power of description: although the rocks are only inferior to those of Duncan's Bay Head, the spray is tossed above their loftiest summits, and falls in such profusion, as to run in rills to the opposite shore : a reservoir, in a commodious situation, is made to receive it, together with the rain which the clouds impart ; and hence, a mill is kept going in the Winter months for grinding the grain of the Island. The agitation of the Spray is often so great, that the water in the spring wells becomes brackish, and a salt taste prevails in the air. The tide is supposed to rise to the height of six fathoms from the lowest ebb : and during a storm from the West, the rise ofthe sea, on that side, is more than two fathoms hio-her than on the East of the Island. From the antiseptic influence ofthe salt particles, perpetually floating in the air, dead bodies were converted into mum mies, which were preserved for a great length of years, and were wont to be exhibited as curiosities, in a Chapel situate in the Island ; but the mummies are"], [718, "STR now properly removed, and the Chapel is unroofed, and mouldering into ruin. Its name is significative ofthe impetuous currents that surround it ; and the tides are supposed to run at the rate of nearly 10 knots an hour. It is composed of sandstone, and sandstone flag. STROMAY, ISLE, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part of the Parish of Harris, and is situate in the Sound. It is uninhabited. STROMNESS, in the Island of Pomona, aud in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland: formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Sandwick: the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 96 meils of malt, \u00a315. of money in lieu of 6 barrels of butter, \u00a310. of money in lieu of Vicarage tythes, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements ; the Village of Stromness pays no part of the Stipend, although its populatiou is not far short of that of both the Country Parishes ; there is a glebe in each Parish : the Minister, who officiates in each Church alter nately, formerly resided in the Parish of Sandwick, until the year 1780, when a new Manse was built in the Parish of Stromness, about a mile from that village: Patron, Lord Dundas, of Aske, who holds the lands of the Bishoprick in lease from the Exchequer : The Church of Stromness, which was dedicated to St. Peter, and which formerly stood a mile distant from where the village is now situate, is ruinous ; and, in 1717, a new Church was built in the Village. but from the increased population, it is not now sufficiently spacious. It is in the Presbytery of Cairston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of the Parish of Stromness, in 1801, was 2223, and, in 1811, was 2297. A General Post-Office is established here. The United Parishes of Strom ness and Sandwick form, toward the West and South-West, the boundary of the Mainland ; their names are derived, the former from the shape of the land, which stretches to some length in the face of a strong current ; and the latter, from a large sandy Bay, surrounded with some of the finest and best cul tivated land in the whole Parish. They exhibit, through their whole extent, great diversity of surface. Their West side is in general high, forming a part of the ridge which shelters the Island in that direction : towards the South and East, they are more plain, more fertile, and better cultivated, and extend to the Bay of Cairston, and Loch of Stennis, their respective boundaries in these directions. They contain Thirty-one square miles, a ninth part of which only has yet been cultivated ; there is about the same proportion in excellent natural grass ; and the remainder, comprehending more than two-third o.' the whole, has been allotted hitherto for the pasturing of sheep, and cattle. Their productions are of"], [719, "STR the same nature with those of the other Parishes ; neither is their mode of agri culture materially different, the same kind ofbear and oats being sown alternately on the same field ; the increase is much the same, but the grain is of rather a superior quality ; and, though there is abundance of both limestone, and marl, that could easily be procured, the small Farmers have as yet contented them selves with sea-weed alone, or mixed with some portion of dung and earth, as a compost for manure. An improvement which merits attention, however, has lately been introduced into the Parish of Sandwick by one of the principal Pro prietors : this is the raising of flax, of an excellent quality, for the dressing of which he has erected a proper mill ; to this improvement he has added a Tannery on the Loch of Stennis, and a Brewery at no great distance ; all of which are entire novelties in this country. Stromness, which is in their immediate vicinity, will, it is likely, prove of great consequence to these improvements : This Village, which, at the beginning of the last Century, consisted of a few irregular Huts, sat down as whim or convenience directed, by the side of the Harbour, has of late risen so rapidly into consequence, that the cause deserves to be explained. By means of several Acts of Parliament, enacted when the principles of Commerce were but little attended to, and as little understood, the Royal Burghs had assumed the right of taxing the Hamlets and Villages that were in their neigh bourhood, in an arbitrary proportion of the burdens which they themselves were bound in law to sustain. Stromness suffered, or at least thought so, from the exercise of this right, which was claimed by the neighbouring Burgh ; and, therefore, long murmured under a burden which was represented as dispropor tioned to her trade and her ability ; and, at length, after repeated remonstrances, refused to bear it any longer. The method of compulsion was instantly adopted by a reference of the point in question to the Supreme Court, in 1754, who pro nounced this judgement : \" That there was no sufficient right in the Borough of Kirkwall, to assess the Village of Stromness ; but, that the said Village should be quit thereof, and free therefrom, in all time coming.\" This sentence, which has every appearance of being founded in justice no less than in law, was, in the spirit of litigation, appealed from, but happily confirmed in The House of Lords, on the 16th of January 1758. Thus an insignificant Village, in the remote regions of the North, was, at that period, sufficiently enlightened to know its own rights, and had spirit enough to reclaim them : while others of great consequence tamely submitted to the yoke, till, emancipated by this memorable decision, they reaped the fruit of her spirited exertions. From that time, Stromness dates the"], [720, "STR epoch of her consequence. The inhabitants are Tradesmen, Shopkeepers, Sai lors, Shipmasters, Pilots, and small proprietors of lands, who are in general an industrious and enterprising people ; and, in point of comfortable living, social spirit, and hospitality to strangers, are not inferior to those of the same rank, in any similar situation, throughout Scotland. The Harbour of Stromness has long been a place of great resort for shipping ; for, nearly three hundred years ago, Ships of different nations, and particularly French and Spanish, in great numbers, occasionally put in there, allured by the excellence ofthe accommoda tion. Through the wdiole of the North, there are few Harbours that can com pare with it, either in point of safety or comniodiousness. The entrance to it is from the South, by a narrow passage of a quarter of a mile ; it expands to double that dimension as it advances up through the Mainland, for more than a mile ; it has a firm clay bottom, and a depth of water sufficient for ves sels of a Thousand tons burden, and is sheltered from the violence of the Winds in all directions. Two Holms guard it from the East, beyond which there is also, as it were, a portion ofthe same Harbour ; in which, Ships of still greater burden commonly ride, on account both of its easier access, and superior depth of water. Excellent, however, as this Harbour is allowed to be, the ships that touch here in the space of one year, do not on an average exceed three hundred and twenty ; whereas formerly they certainly doubled, or even perhaps tripled that number. To account for this decrease, it may be observed, that the Pentland Firth, which is the most direct passage for the trade in this quarter, has been, by a Nautical survey, the erection ofa Light-House, and the experi ence of Mariners, divested of almost all its dangers; and, in case of contrary winds, the noble Harbour of The Long Hope is near and easy of access ; so that Vessels now generally prefer the direct course through the Firth, to the more cir cuitous one by Stromness. The air is often raw and damp, but not unhealthy. The tenants ofthe residing Heritors usually assist, for two days, in carrying home upon their horses, the peats of the Proprietors ; and this is almost the only ser vice required of them. Here is a Grammar School : and the Society for propa gating Christian Knowledge give yearly to a Schoolmaster \u00a38., and \u00a33. yearly to a School-mistress, both of them in the village of Stromness ; the School fees are very moderate : there are also four Schools, where the masters teach read ing, writing, and arithmetic ; and three Schools, in which the Mistresses teach reading, knitting stockings, and sewing. Here is a Slate-quarry, and there are appearances of lead, and iron-ore. Few of those ancient ruins, that are"], [721, "STR known by the name of Picts' Houses, are to be met with in this District, though tumuli or barrows are numerous. Stromness is the Seat of the Presbytery of Cairston. The House built by The Reverend George Graham, the last Bishop of Orkney, and in which he resided some part ofthe year, is still standing ; and the Episcopal Arms, and the date of its erection, 1633, are cut in free-stone above the door. A Market for Cattle is holden here. Great numbers of young- Men go from hence into the Service of The Hudson's Bay Company : and Ves sels from Newcastle, Whitby, and Hull, on the whale-fishery, for Davis Straits, and Greenland, usually stop some days at the harbour of Stromness, on their outward passage, to engage mariners. Stromness is in the Latitude of 58\u00b0 56' 0\" North, and in the Longitude of S' 31' 20\" West from Greenwich. There is a kind of road between Kirkwall and Stromness ; but, to render it passable during winter, three or four single-arch bridges, over as many rivulets, together with one large bridge, over the outlet ofthe Lake of Stennis, would be necessary. A very few hundred pounds, however, judiciously expended, would greatly im prove the communication between the Capital of Orkney, and this its principal Sea-port. See, Sandwick. STRONFERNAN, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Kenmore. It is a small village, pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of Loch Tay, at the distance of 10 m. S. W. from Aberfeldy. STRONSAY, ISLAND, one of the Orkneys ; formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Eday ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a348.. 1.. 9. in money, together with the glebes, manse, and some Vicarage tythes that are paid in kind ; there is no fund for Communion elements, as the Stipend was never modified by the Court of Teinds : Patron, Lord Dundas : About the time ofthe Reformation, there were three Parish Kirks in the Island of Stronsay, one of them being dedicated to The Virgin Mary, another to St. Peter, and the third to St. Nicholas. It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 924, and, in 1811, was 864. This is a pretty large Island, rather flat, and situate to the North-East of Sha pinsay ; from which it is divided by a rapid Firth of the same name, six miles wide, and on that quarter bounds the group ofthe Orkney Islands. This Island is not only curiously indented, but almost cut into three distinct Isles, which were formerly so many distinct Parishes ; and this intersection has probably given rise to its name, The Isle of Strands or Stronsay. Its dimensions are, seven miles long, and four miles broad ; through which are exhibited much vol. if, 4 X"], [722, "STR variety of soil, and elevation, and, while it equals several of the other Islands in the production ofthe fruits ofthe earth, it enjoys one advantage over them, in its very convenient situation for an extensive and lucrative Fishery : this advan tage is, however, much neglected at present: but, if it ever be again revived, the two fine Harbours of which this Island can boast, may contribute much to its prosperity: Linga Sound is one of these, which lies on the West side; and Papay Sound, on the North-East, is the other ; and both of them are, on the proper anchoring ground, secure places for shipping. Toward the East Coast, among the rocks, are three Mineral springs almost close together, differing in strength, though ofthe same nature, chalybeates ; and such confidence do the people place in these Springs, (which go under the general name of The Well of Kildinguie) , and at the same time in that particular sea-weed named Dulse (the common fucus palmatus), produced in Guiodin (perhaps the Bay of Odin), as to have occasioned the Proverb, \" That the Well of Kildinguie, and the Dulse of Guiodin, can cure all maladies, except Black Death.\" The two^most remark able Promontories, are Borrorchead, on the South East, and Rothesholm Head, on the South West ; these are sheep walks ; the latter of which, being of great extent, comprehends the whole peat-moss in the Island of Stronsay ; and from whence the Inhabitants have, from time immemorial, been in use to cast peats or turf for fuel, on paying a small acknowledgement in money or services, to the tenant or possessor of the Farm of Rothesholm. Here are three sandy Bays, the one on the East, being called Mill Bay ; that on the South, the Bay of Holland; and the third on the West, the Bay of Erigarth or West Wick; but they do not afford safe anchorage, on account ofthe skerries or low sunken rocks with which they are interspersed ; these rocks, however, are the chief source of emolument to the Inhabitants, from the immense quantity of tang or sea-weed, which they produce, for the making of kelp : and of which this Island on an average produces no less than 300 tons per annum. To the enterprising spirit of the late James Fea, of Whitehall, the manufacture of this valuable Com modity was first introduced into this Island, in the year 1722 ; and whose name for such an important benefit, must ever be remembered with honour and gratitude. Lord Dundas has the Superiorities of all the lands in this District; besides whom, there are six large, and seven smaller Proprietors. Here are the remains of four Chapels, one of which is called St. Margarets Kirk. The situation of this District, surrounded as it is by the sea, and at a moderate elevation above the level of it, is thus rendered wholesome and"], [723, "STR agreeable, particularly during the summer months, when the seasons are dry, and warm ; but, as it is exposed to heavy rains and thick weather in winter, with gales of wind in Spring, and Autumn, those who cannot easily put up with retirement, and to be confined within narrow bounds, for seven or eight months, must not fix their abode in Stronsay. Some ofthe On-call Work, or undefined Services of ancient times, are still exacted. And many of the common people are yet so credulous, as to believe in the existence of Fairies. This Parish com prehends the Isle of Auskerry, Home of Huip, Little Linga, Mukle Linga, and Papa Stronsay. Upon the Hill-grounds, are vast flocks of golden plovers, which upon being put upon the wing, really seem to darken the air. The Brough is a large isolated mass of rock, which appears to have been disjoined from the Island by some violent convulsion ; it is directly exposed to all the fury of the German Ocean, which is terribly agitated by East winds. There are many caverns here, into which a boat may enter in calm weather, and are the habita tion of seals : and upon all the ledges of the rocks, during the season of incuba tion, are prodigious numbers of sea-fowls. Airie is the seat of the Misses Fea, one ofthe oldest surnames in Orkney. The name of Traill is also very common here, and is very ancient : the Traills are said to be descended from a younger son ofthe Traills, of Blebo, in Fife, who had migrated Northward*: Traill, of Papa Westray, is the most ancient of the name in Orkney. The rocks are en tirely composed of sandstone, and sandstone flag ; which latter sometimes passes to shistose clay. STRONTI AN, in the District, and Shire of Argyle ; and in the Parish of Ard namurchan. It is 140 m. W. N. W. from Edinburgh. This is a small Village situate in the District of Sunart, and erected for the accommodation ofthe Miners. It has lately become famous, for having given to the world a new mineral, which is distinguished by the name of Strontites ; the chymical properties whereof are ably described by Dr. Kirwan, in the Transactions of The Royal Irish Aca demy; and by Thomas Charles Hope, M. D. in vol. 4. p. 2. page 3. ofthe Trans actions of The Royal Society of Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is estab lished here ; and an excellent line of road has been made, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners. STROWAN, i. e. STREAMS, in the Shire of Perth : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Blair- Athol. It is situate near the confluence ofthe rivers Garrie, and Erochty; which streams seem to have given name to the Parish, and to Robertson, of Stroican, his title. See, Blair- Athol.

They are situate at the entrance of Loch Broom, and are favourably situate for fishing stations. They lie to the Northward of Ullapool. These are a considerable number of small Isles, with a most dreary appearance, and, according to Mr. Pennant, \"are miscalled The Summer Islands.\" See, Cromarty. SUNART, in the District, and Shire of Argyle ; and in the Parish of Ard namurchan. This District stretches along the Northern coast of that arm ofthe sea, called Loch Sunart, which is navigable ; and which extends about 20 miles in length, and from \\\\ to 2 miles in breadth. An excellent road has been made through this district, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners. See, Ardnamurchan, SUTHERLAND, SHIRE. This is one of the most Northern Shires of Scotland, and contains about 1,478,400 English acres. It is exceedingly rug ged and mountainous. It comprehends the three great Districts of Strath-Naver, Assint, and Sutherland : the former of which was anciently a County of itself. The Lordship of Sutherland is unquestionably one of the most extensive and most populous Estates, belonging to one Proprietor, in the Island of Great Bri tain : it is supposed to contain nearly two-thirds of the valued rent of the Shire, and to be 739,200 English acres in extent. The Estate of Reay is also very large, and is calculated to be about 30 miles in length, and from 15 to 20 miles in breadth : the greater part of it, however, is very rugged, par-"], [725, "S W I ticularly a vast tract of wild country, known under the name of Lord Reay's Forest ; which is numerously stocked with red deer. Along the coast are several commodious harbours, and fishing stations. It is principally appropriated to the pastuarage of black cattle, and sheep. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 23,117, and, in 1811, was 23,629. Sutherland gives the title of Countess to Elizabeth Sutherland Gower, Countess of Sutherland, and Baroness of Strathnaver: Her Ladyship having succeeded her Father, William, the late Earl, on the 16th of June 1766; and was married, on the 4th of September 1785, to The Most Noble George, Marquis of Stafford. According to the traditional account of some Scottish writers, this great Family in the Peerage is older than any in North Britain, if not in all Europe ; for, in the reign of Corbred the Second, A. D., 76, a Colony, called Catti, coming from Germany to Scotland, there divided themselves into two parts ; from those in the North, the country was called Caithness, and from those in the South, Sutherland ; and were Thanes thereof before the title of Earl was used in the Kingdom. It has been an Earldom in the Sutherland Family ever since the year 1057 : and Her Ladyship is Premier Countess of Scotland. It sends one Member to Parliament; and it is singular, that there are no Freeholders of the Shire, as all the voters and proprietors hold ofthe Family of Sutherland ; but, by a special Act of Parliament, every Heritor who is possessed of property to the extent of \u00a3200. Scotch of valued rent is entitled to vote at elections, and which is a much better qualification than mere Superiority. See, Dornoch, and Inverness.

This is a small Village, situate near the river Oxnam, and at the distance of 6 miles S. E. from Jedburgh. SWINTON, in the Shire of Berwick: formerly a Vicarage, united to the Chapel of Simprin, on the 24th of September, 1761 : the Stipend of which, in 1811, consisted of 100 bolls of oats, Linlithgow measure, 106 bolls of barley, \u00a312.. 12. .8. Vicarage teinds, a manse (built in 1771), a garden, and two glebes, together with the servitudes of two horses and two cows : \u2014 of the victual Sti pend, 56 bolls are paid out of Paxton, in the Parish of Hutton ; a chalder of barley is paid out ofthe lands of Eyemouth ; and \u00a326.. 5.. 0. of Vicarage out ofthe lands ofthe ancient Parish of Horndean, which is now comprehended in the Parish ofLady-Kirk : these irregularities probably arose from the dependance of this Par ish on the Abbey of Coldingham ; the Abbot drawing the best victual out of this district and paying his dependent Clergy from places where the.grain was worse in quality: \u2014 Patron, The Crown : The Church was built in 1729, to which a very handsome Aisle on the North side of it was added, in 1782. It is in the Presby tery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Popu lation ofthe United Parishes, in 1801, (comprising the Estates of John Swinton, Esq., of Swinton, of Miss Ker, of Swinton Hill, of Captain Halket, of Swinton Mill, and of Patrick Murray, Esq , of Simprin) was 875, and, in 1811, was 866. It is 5 m. N. from Coldstream. The United Parish is about 4 miles in length, and from three to three miles and a quarter in breadth : the general appearance is neither uniformly flat, nor is it mountainous or rocky ; it exhibits a set of gentle elevations, stretching from East to West with alternate vallies between them : the soil is in general, deep, and for the most part fertile, and to a high degree productive of grass : some ofthe plains are marshy, but the greater part is arable, and under culture. The climate is often moist, and foggy, and the ague sometimes prevails with great virulence here; The Roads are bad. All the Coals are brought from Northumberland, a distance of eight miles, and across the Tweed at a ford precarious, and often fatal by the rashness of the men, and the sudden rise ofthe river. The only stream of importance is the Leet, the banks of which are very low, and much exposed to inundations. Here is abundance of excellent free-stone ; particularly one Quarry in the Farm of Swinton Quarter, on which the Family of Swinton retained a servitude when they"], [727, "S Y M sold the land. The Fairs are holden at Swinton, on the third Thursday in June, and the fourth Tuesday in October. Poor's Rates are established here. The greatest curiosity in the Parish of Swinton, is the antiquity of the Family of Swinton. This Family is said to have received the first grant of these lands, as a reward for clearing the district of Swine, which at that time, are said to have much infested it. This fact seems not to rest merely on tradition ; for the name, the bearings of the arms, and other circumstances, appear to corroborate the opinion. The Swintons afterwards made a conspicuous figure in the reign of Malcolm Canmore, who confirmed to them the property of the whole Parish, by one of the first Charters granted in Scotland, and still preserved in the archives ofthe Church of Durham. During the Commonwealth, the then Repre sentative of the Swinton Family having espoused the cause of Cromwell, the estate was forfeited at the Restoration of Charles the Second, but it was given back at the Revolution. However, a long exile, while their Revenues were sequestrated, had so involved the family, that it became necessary to sell the three Farms of Mont Suir, which were bought by the Kers, of Morriston, who still possess them. And some years afterwards, the Father of the late Lord Swinton sold three more Farms to Provost Coutts, whose heirs sold them about the year 1754 to William Hall, of Whitehall ; and who, aster many meliora tions at a great expense, sold them to Patrick Lord Elibank, for more than double his purchase money. Yet, notwithstanding all these alienations, the Swinton estate is still a noble and extensive property. And, it appears, that Twenty Two Barons, including the late Proprietor, occupied the estate during a period of 731 years ; the average of which is upwards of 33 years to each pro prietor ; and this is the more remarkable, when we recollect the turbulent spirit of Aristocracy, and the vicinity of England, which gave rise to such frequent feudal broils and border wars, during that long period. SWINZEE, CASTLE, v. LATHERON. SYMINGTON, or SYMONTON, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 106 bolls and 2 firlots of meal, 13| bolls of bear, \u00a335. in money, and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of 4 acres : Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church is old, dark, and too small.

This Parish contains about 2100 acres ; of which,"], [728, "T A I upwards of one-half are cultivated, and the remainder are appropriated to pastu rage. The surface is very agreeably diversified ; and the soil is in general a clay, or a rich black loam, on a bottom of freestone. The air is dry, and salu brious. The great road from Port Patrick, to Glasgow and Edinburgh, passes through the Village. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees and perquisites, and a good house and garden. Coals, and lime-stone, are in abundance. Many ofthe tenants are astricted to a heavy thirlage, an impolitic species of vassalage which is loudly complained of. On the South-West borders of the Parish, is the House of Rosemount, the elegant Seat of William Fullarton, Esq. SYMINGTON, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Vicar age, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 53 bolls 1 firlot 3 pecks of meal, 6 bolls 3 firlots 3f lippies ofbear, 1 boll 3 pecks and f lippie of oats, \u00a331.. 12.. 9.

This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and nearly the same in breadth. The surface is in general level, sloping from the base of the hill of Tinto to the Clyde : and the greater part is inclosed, and well culti vated. Near the village, is an eminence, called The Castle Hill, which appears to have been strongly fortified, and is now planted with various kinds of trees. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, with a house and garden, T 1 AIN, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Ross: formerly a Collegiate Church, founded by Thomas, Bishop of Ross, in 1481, for a Provost, eleven Prebendaries, and three Singing-Boys : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 120 bolls of victual, one-half payable in barley, and the other half in oat-meal, together with \u00a34..15..0.

The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday after the first of January, the third Tuesday in March, the second Wednesday in July, the third Wednesday in August, the third Tuesday in October, the 22dof November, and the Tuesday before Christmas. It is the Capital of the Shii'e ; and is one ofthe Contributary Royal Boroughs with Dingwall, in sending one Member to Parliament. The Town has lately received a considerable increase towards the East, where several acres have been feued for building, on the estate of Mr. Macleod, of Geanies. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the Southern shore of the Firth of Dornoch, which is sometimes called the Firth of Tain. The surface is in general flat, except towards the West, where it rises into small hills. The soil is various, but tolerably fertile. The coast is flat, and sandy. The Parochial School is very ablv conducted, and is in a flourishing condition: Besides which, there is a Society's School in the Eastern district. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The only manufactures carried on here, are the spinning of flax, and the tanning of leather. Fuel is moderate. Mr. Macleod, of Cadboll, is the prin cipal Proprietor. The chief Mansions are, Ankerville, the seat of David Ross, Esq., one ofthe Senators of The Court of Session, by the title of Lord Ankerville, \u2014 and, Little Tarrel, the seat of Mr Baillie. Captain Richard Franks, an honest Cavalier, who, during the Usurpation made an angling peregrination from the banks ofthe Trent to John o' Groats House, calls Tain, \" as exemplary as any place for Justice, that never uses gibbet or halter to hang a man, but sacks all their malefactors, so swims them to their graves.\" T AIT'S CROSS, v.

TANNADICE, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Rectory belonging to the See of St. Andrew's : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 6 chalders of victual, \u00a350. Sterling, and 100 merks for Communion elements : the manse is a comfort- able house, and in excellent repair, and the offices were re-built in 1812: the glebe consists of 8 acres, and a large garden : Patron, St. Mary's College, in The University of St. Andrew's : The Church is in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Forfar, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Popula- tion of this Parish, in 1801, was 1373, and, in 1811, was 1510. It is 5f m. N. from Forfar. This Parish is 12 miles in length, and from 4 to 10 miles in breadth: part of it is hilly, and mountainous, and is appropriated to the pas- turage of large flocks of sheep ; and the banks of the rivers South Esk, and Noran, with which it is watered, and which abound with salmon and trout, pre- sent a variety of romantic scenery. The arable soil is, in general, a soft loam, and is very productive, and well cultivated. The air is dry, and cold, but not unhealthy. Here is abundance of red free-stone, and granite ; and in the Glen of Ogil, is a Quarry of blue slate, now relinquished. Peats, and turf, are the fuel used in the higher parts ofthe Parish, and which are in plenty ; but, in the lower parts, furze and broom, and coals, which are brought from the distance of 20 miles. The roads are in good repair. Tannadice House is the beautiful resi- dence of Charles Ogilvie, Esq., by whom it was built, and is surrounded with extensive Plantations : and, especially, the fine House of Downie Park, the noble Seat of William Rattray, Esq., by whom it was erected : Both of these Gen- tlemen acquired their fortunes in the Service of The East India Company, the former of them in the Medical, and the latter in the Military department. The Glen of Quiech was long the property, and residence of the Lindsays, a branch ofthe Crawfurd Family : the last male of whom was, within these Twenty-five years, Episcopal Minister in the City of St. Andrew's. The residence of these ancient Lindsays was, many years ago, taken down, and a tolerably good house built upon its site, as a Shooting-box, by Lindsay Carnegie, of Kinblethmont, who had purchased the property, and considered himself of the same Family with its former occupants ; in right of which, he claimed the Peerage of Spynie,"], [731, "TAR that had been conferred upon one of the Crawfurd family. Mr. Lindsay sold this estate, several years ago, and it has since been purchased by Dr. Maclagan. The Lindsays, of Glen Quiech, were once proprietors of the Farm of Barnyards, which, together with other property, were some years ago purchased from James Carnegie Arbuthnot, of Balnamoon, by the present Proprietor Charles Ogilvie, Esq., of Tannadice. The old Castle of Barnyards is completely obli terated. East Achlouchrie, the romantic residence of John Ogilvie, Esq. , of Insh-Evan, is surrounded with extensive pleasure grounds, -and a well cultivated garden : near which is a small conical mount, called The Castle Hill, washed on the South by the Esk, aud on the North is a deep trench, apparently dug with the intention of diverting a part ofthe water of the river into that channel, and thereby of insulating it. Near the bridge of Sheal-Hill, are the few remains of the Castle of Quiech : the name Quiech, as applied both to this place and the Glen in this Parish, is descriptive of their appearance, being, to a lively imagi nation, that ofa small cap or quiech, called coiech in Gaelic : According to tra dition, Quiech was founded by the Cumyns, and was the first place in the Parish dedicated to the Public celebration of the ordinances of Christianity : but, be this as it may, it can with certainty be affirmed, to have been in later times the residence of The Earls of Buchan : but its vestiges are rapidly disappearing, and the little that remains of it will soon be removed by Colonel Rattray, the pre sent Proprietor. There are numerous towering eminences, especially the Moun tain, called St. Arnold's Seat, upon which is a large cairn, and from whence the prospect is particularly beautiful and extensive. The Estate of Coul is the property of Mr. Ogilvie, of Isla-Bank. TARANSAY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part of the Parish of Harris. This isa high, rocky Island, about four miles long, and one mile broad, lying in a Western direction from the mouth of West Loch Tarbert. TARBAT, partly in the Shire of Cromarty, and partly in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Rectory and Mensal Church, belonging to The Bishop of Ross : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 9 chalders of victual, payable equally in bear, and oat-meal, and 300 merks Scotch in money : the manse was built in 1707 : the glebe consists of 4 acres : Patron, The Honourable Mrs. Mackenzie : The Church was built in 1756. It is in the Presbytery of Tain, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1343, and, in 1811, was 1379. It is 10 m. E. b. N. from Tain. This Parish contains 5081 acres; of 4Y2"], [732, "TAR which, 2998 are arable, and are abundantly fertile, and well cultivated. It is a Peninsula, projecting between the Firths of Dornoch, and Moray : and, after passing Tarbat Ness, the sea turns into the land, and forms a capacious Bay, at the South-East corner of which lies the harbour of Port-Maholmack: but the Pier is in ruins. The coast abounds with a variety of excellent fish, especially lobsters. At the Northern extremity is a Creek, called Castle-Haven, from the ruins of an ancient Castle near it, and from which the first Earl of Cromarty assumed one of his titles of Nobility. The climate is salubrious. Fuel is expen sive. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites, and a convenient house. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. Here are inexhaus tible quarries of free-stone, of a durable quality, and beautiful colour. It has erroneously been supposed, that there was a Roman Station here. This Parish originally belonged to the Shire of Ross ; but, in the year 1693, Cromarty hav ing been erected into a separate Jurisdiction, and the property of The Earl of Cromarty in different Parishes being transferred to the newly established County the Barony of Tarbat, as a part of his estate, was included in that arrangement ; and the Parish is now almost equally divided between the Shires of Ross, and Cromarty. The Lands ofthe Parish hold of The Crown. The district to the East of Port-Maholmack was of old called, The Forest ofthe Earl of 'Ross, and continues to pay \u00a340. Scotch of Crown rent. Geanies is the seat ofthe very re spectable Family of Macleod. TARBERT, in the District of Cantyre, and Shire of Argyle; and in the Parish of Killcalmonell. It is 140 m. W.b. S. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here, with three Post days in the week. The Castle, which is now in ruins, appears to have been of great strength. The Lochs of East and West Tarbert are two arms of the sea, which, by approximation, peninsulate the district of Cantyre. A Missionary is established here by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge, for the Parishes of Killcalmonell, and South Knapdale. By a Memorial presented to The Parliamentary Com missioners, in the month of January 1809, on behalf of John Campbell, Esq., of Stonefield, it appears, \" That the Village of Tarbert in Loch Fine in the Shire of Argyle, was one ofthe most considerable places in the West Highlands. It has peculiar natural advantages from local situation, and a safe and good har bour. It is a Burgh of Regality, and was formerly, when the County of Argyle formed two Shires, the Chief Town ofthe Shire of Tarbert. In East Tarbert there is a public Ferry to Cowal and to Clyde, and Packets and Vessels ply"], [733, "TAR weekly there to transport the Inhabitants of the surrounding County, and of Islay, Jura, Collonsay, &c, to and from the Clyde. There is likewise a Packet plying constantly between West Tarbert and the Sound of Islay, by which the Mail is conveyed to these countries ; and by the Isthmus of Tarbert, goods of all sorts and every article of import are conveyed to the adjacent Coasts and Islands, while their exports are conveyed to and shipped at East Tarbert for the Clyde, and the Low Country of Scotland. The late Proprietor of Tarbert was many years ago at some expense in constructing a Quay and Land-breast there, to accommodate the trade ofthe place ; but these works have fallen into disrepair, and seem never to have been sufficiently built and constructed on that extensive scale which was necessary to give facility and accommodation to the many people who daily resort to it, independent of the accommodation neces sary for the inhabitants of the Village, where there are nearly One Hundred families chiefly engaged in trade, in fishing, and in sea-faring. For these rea sons, the Memorialists think that much public benefit would accrue from improv ing the Quay and Landing-Place at East Tarbert, as well as the access to them, and from renewing the Land-breast under the Village.\" \u2014 To this The Commissioners have agreed, the expense consisting chiefly in an enlargement of the Quay, and removing certain rocks which obstruct the entrance of this small Harbour. And \" the utility of improving Tarbert Harbour will be understood by remarking, that the Isthmus which separates Cantyre from the rest of the Shire of Argyle at this place, does not exceed a mile and a half in breadth, and that instead of making the Canal since executed at Crinan, a Canal was at first intended to be made here, it being obviously the centre of communication between the numerous Sea Lochs, which indent the Coast of the Shire of Argyle.\" \u2014 TARBET, in the Shire of Dumbarton ; and in the Parish of Arroquhar. It is 79 m. W. N. W. from Edinburgh. It is a small Village, with a decent Inn, on the Eastern bank of Loch Lomond, and on the great Road, leading to Tyndrum. TARBOLTON, or TORBOLTON, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., the manse was lately re-built : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1766, and, in 1811, was 1966. It is 4 m. W. from Mauch-"], [734, "TAR line. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, and the greater part of it is well cultivated. The climate is rainy. The roads are in good repair. The emoluments ofthe Parochial School are about \u00a350. per annum. Near the Village, stands the ruinous Monastery of Feale, having a small Hamlet of the same name adjacent to it ; it is said to have belonged to the Monks ofthe order of Clugny, and to have been a Cell to the Abbey of Paisley : Its Founder is unknown : the Prior of this place was one of those, who prevented the Castle of Dumbarton from being surrendered to the English, in 1544, in opposition to The Earl of Lennox, then Governor of it. Coylsfield, the elegant Mansion of The Earl of Eelintoun, is surrounded with extensive Plantations. Enter kine, the seat of Mr. Cunningham ; and Smithstone, the seat of M. Cooper, are also elegant Residences. TARLAND, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Migvie united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 35 bolls of meal, at 8 stone per boll, 13 bolls ofbear, 700 merks in money, and \u00a38.. 6. .8. for Communion elements : the manse is in tolerable re pair : the glebe consists of about 4 acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in good condition : The Minister preaches regularly two Sundays at Tarland, and the third at Migvie, which Churches are about 2 Scotch miles distant from each other. It is in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1801, was 922, aud, in 1811, was 932. It is 123 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Village of Tarland, situate nearly in the centre of the District of Cromar, is a Burgh of Barony, with a weekly Market on Wednesday, and six annual Fairs, which are much resorted to. A General Post-Office is established here. The Earl of Aberdeen, the benevolent Proprietor, has also a Granary here for the reception of his victual rents. The only branch of manufacture, is that of spinning linen yarn, and knit ting hose. The roads are in pretty good repair. This Parish is very irregular, and disjoined : the lands about the Village are mostly flat, and watered by the Deskry ; but the greater part is mountainous, and covered with heath, and in tensely cold. Game, of all kinds, are abundant. A part ofthe Parish of Tar land, separated by the Parish of Strathdon, and lying along the North side ofthe river Don, is between three and four miles in length ; and in one Glen, called Glen-Ernon, from the water of Ernon which runs though it, is about two miles in breadth : This detached part of the Parish is under the inspection of a Mis sionary Minister, whose Salary is paid from the Royal Bounty, and who performs"], [735, "T A S all the parts ofthe Ministerial office among the inhabitants : it is about 15 miles from the Parish Church of Tarland : in this District, are the Mansion-Houses of Mr. Forbes, of Skellater, \u2014 Mr. Forbes, of Inver-Emon, \u2014 Mr. Anderson, of Candacraig, \u2014 and Mr. Houston, of Edinglassie.

It is in the Presbytery of Ellon, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 1756, and, in 1811, was 1894. It is 139 m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the third Tuesday, O. S., in September, and the fourth Tuesday, O. S., in December. A General Post- Office is established here. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth. The general appearance is flat, interspersed with some hills of small size : the soil is in some parts deep, and in others shallow, but for the most part fertile. The air is healthy. It is watered by the river Ythan. A considerable part of the rent is payable in oat-meal, bear, and several cus toms and services. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. The only manufacture carried on here is the knitting of stockings.

TEALING, in the Shire of Forfar: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe: Patron, The Crown : The Church is indifferent It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 755, and, in 181 1, was 779. It is 5| m. N. from Dundee. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth, stretching along the South side of the Sidlaw Hills, and is principally appropriated to pasturage. The air is moist and cold, but not unhealthy. Agriculture has been much at tended to, particularly irrigation or watering of meadow- lands, which has been introduced and practised with success by Patrick Scrymgeour, Esq., of Tealing, one of the principal Proprietors, and who is Resident. Many Plan tations have lately been made here. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites, and a house, garden, and about an English acre of land. Various antiquities have been discovered here. The roads are indifferent. Turf is the common fuel, but coals are also much in use, which are brought from Dundee. TEAN, one of The Scilly Islands. This Island is estimated to contain about 70 acres : it is at present uninhabited, but is remarkable for having been the residence of one Mr. Nance, of Cornwall, who first introduced the making of kelp into these Islands. This is probably the Sancta Theona of the Records ; deriving its name from Theonls, Bishop of Gloucester, who was elected Arch bishop of London, in 545. TEANINICH, v. ALNESS. TEAY, ST., CHAPEL, v.

As the District of Clerkington was anciently but thinly peopled, its Church was of very small value. David the Second granted the Manor of Clerkington to Walter Bisset ; and he trans- ferred the Church, with its tythes, and pertinents, to the Monks of Newbottle ; granting them, at the same time, an annual rent of five merks, from the Manor. During the reign of Robert the Third, Archieald Earl of Angus sold the Barony of Clerkington to Adam Forrester, of Corstorphin, who acquired from Robert a charter of confirmation ; and he also obtained from him, a release of the Castle wards, issuing from this Barony to the king. At the time of the Reformation, the Patronage ofthe Church, with the annual rent of five merks from the mill of Clerkington, were enjoyed by Mark Ker, the Commendator of Newbottle, who transmitted the whole to his descendants ; and, acquiring the Temporal estate, they changed the name of Clerkington to New Ancrum. \u2014 The Chapelry of Morthwait comprehended the iands of Morthicait, and the Forest of Gladewys, being the Upper half of the valley of Gladehouse water : the vil- lage of Morthwaits stands on the Western side of the stream, below the Moor foot Hills, and three miles above Clerkington. The lands of Morthwait were granted by David the First to the Monks of Newbottle : and, they obtained from Alexander the Second the Forest of Gladewys, upon the Gladewys water. After the grant of David the First, the Monks established a Chapel at Morth- wait ; and the Abbot enjoyed the Patronage of it, until the Reformation : after that great change, the Commendator, coming in his place, enjoyed his rights, till the extensive estates of the Abbey were converted into a Temporal Lordship, which descended to the heirs ofthe Commendator, Earls of Ancrum, and Mar- quises of Lothian. \u2014 The Chapelry, and Manor of Balantrodach, lay at the foot of the Gladehouse icater, on the Western side of the South Esk. This Manor was granted by David the First to The Knights of the Temple ; who formed their principal seat, in Scotland, at Balantrodach ; and built the Chapel here. On the suppression of those Knights, in 1312, their establishment at Balantnv dach, with the Manor, and Chapel, passed to the Knights of St. John of Jerusa lem, who enjoyed the whole, till the Reformation. As interest mingled much in that Reform, the estate of the Knights was converted into a Temporal Lordship, for Sir James Sandilands, the Preceptor, who was created Lord Torphichen : and, in December 1618, James Lord Torphichen was served heir lo his father, in the Barony of Balantrodach, within the Barony of Torphichen. \u2014 Aster the vol. ii. 4 Z"], [738, "TER Reformation, the Parish of Clerkington, and the Chapelries of Morthwait and Balantrodach, were united into one Parish, with the Templars' Chapel, for the Church ; and from it, the United Parish obtained the name of Temple. The Patronage of this United Parish was divided into three Shares, in conformity to the three ancient establishments ; and each ofthe three Patrons was to enjoy the right, by turns. The third share of Lord Torphichen was acquired, with the Barony of Balantrodach, by Dundas, of Amiston, to which place Temple is ad- jacent. The two shares, which belonged to the Earls of Ancrum, were acquired in the Eighteenth century, with the manor of Clerkington, by Hepburn, who restored the ancient name of Clerkington ; and whose descendants now most wor- thily enjoy the same, together with two-thirds of the Patronage of Temple Church. It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweed- dale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 855, and, in 1811, (including 80 Persons on the Farms of Broadwood and Fountain-Side) was 1058. It is 6 m. S. from Dalkeith. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth ; besides which, there is a detached part comprehending 300 acres of clay soil, and insulated by the Parish of Borthwick, at the distance of four miles from the rest ofthe District. The arable part of the In-field land is mostly dry and sharp, upon a gravelly bottom, and tolerably fertile : the Out field part is ofthe same quality, and hilly, and affords pasture to about 8500 sheep, and 760 head of black cattle. The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem enjoyed a Regal Jurisdiction over their Barony of Balantrodach ; which was comprehended in their Regality of Torphichen. When The Knights of St. John had been con- verted, by the Reformation, into Temporal Lords, both the Barony, and Rega- lity, became vested in them, as Lords of Parliament. On the abolition of Here- ditary Jurisdictions, in 1747, Lord Torphichen was paid \u00a3134.. 12.. 6. for this Regality. Here is a Gun-Powder Manufactory. Excellent Roads, and Bridges, are at present making here. TEMPLE, The, v. URQUHART. TEMPLE-LISTON, v. KIRK-LISTON. TENTS MUIRS, v. LEUCHARS.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 510, and, in 1811, was 534. It is 5 m. W. from Dumfries. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the Western bank of the river Nith. The surface is level, and the soil is in general either alight loam, or sand. Fuel is extremely dear. In the Nith is a salmon fishery, from which the Minister of this Parish draws \u00a32.. 16.. 0. as Teind. The College of Lincluden is situate upon the water of Clu den, where it falls into the river Nith, about two miles North from Dumfries : This House was originally a Priory of Benedictine Nuns, founded in the reign of King Malcolm the Fourth, by Uthred, father to Rolland, Lord of Galloway, who was buried here : By him it was endowed with divers lands, lying within the Baronies of Corse Michael, and Drumsleith. This Priory was afterwards changed by Archibald the Grim, Earl of Douglas, Lord of Galloway and Both well, Panitarius Scoti\u0153, into a College or Provostry, consisting ofa Provost, and 12 Beadsmen, because of the lewd and scandalous lives of the Nuns. This Earl died in the year 1400, and was interred in the Sacristy or Vestry here. The last Provost was John Douglas, of Boatford, when Lincluden became a Temporal Barony in 1565 : since which period, it has been the property of the Nithsdale Family. From what remains of that ancient building, which is part of the Pro vost's house, the Chancel, and some of the South wall ofthe Church, an idea may easily be formed of its original splendour. The Choir in particular was finished in the finest style of the florid Gothic. The roof was treble, in the man ner of that of King's College at Cambridge, and the trusses, from whence the ribbed arch-work sprung, are covered with coats of arms ; the lower roof is now entirely demolished ; the middle one, a plain arch, is still standing ; but the uppermost roof, which consisted of timber and lead, was destroyed at the Reformation. The Earls of Douglas, when in the zenith of their power and greatness, expended considerable sums in ornamenting this place, which was their favourite residence, when Wardens of the West Marches. In the chancel is the elegant tomb of Margaret, daughter of Robert the Third, wife of Archi bald Earl of Douglas, first Duke of Terrouenne, and son of Archibald the Grim. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of this College. The old Tower, called Moscrops Tower, which was built by Sir John Maxwell, who married Agnes, the eldest daughter of William, Lord Herries, and by whom he got the 4Z2"], [740, "T H O title and estate of Terregles, has lately been taken down, and a princely Mansion erected in its place. TERRENZEAN, CASTLE, v. CUMNOCK, OLD. TEVIOT-D ALE, a District, in the Shire of Roxburgh. It is so named from the river Teviot, which flows through it : and the District occupies so large a territory, that the Shire itself is often called by the same name. It gives the title of Duke to His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland. TEXA, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the District of Islay, and Shire of Argyle: It constitutes part of the Parish of Killdalton. The Chapel is in ruins, but the burying ground is still in use. This Island is about two miles in length, and above half a mile in breadth. It affords good pasturage ; and, on the North side, is excellent anchorage for large ships. THAINSTOWN, v. KINTORE.

It wholly belongs to the Marquis of Queensberry. The Fairs are holden on the second Tuesdays, O.

A General Post-Office is established here. THORNHILL, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Kincardine. This is an improving Village, now joined by a long street to the Village of Norriston, and situate on the great road from Stirling to the Fort of Inversnaid. Here is a Tannery.

THURSO, or THORSAA, in the Shire of Caithness : formerly a Chapelry, belonging to the Bishoprick of Caithness ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 6 chalders of victual, half payable in meal, and half in bear, and \u00a350. Sterling, together with \u00a3100. Scotch for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe is not large, but the soil is fertile : Patron, Sir John Sinclair, Bart., of Ulbster: The Church is built in the Gothic style, in the form ofa Cross, and though not large, is a substantial and commodious edifice : in the South Aisle is the burying-place of the Family of Sinclair, of Murkle : the North Aisle belongs to the Town exclusively : and the rest is possessed by the Country Heritors and their Tenants. It is in the Presbytery of Caithness, and Synod of Caithness and Sutherland. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, .in 1801, was 3628, and, in 1811, was 3462. It is 279 m. N. from Edinburgh. . The Market is on Friday, and is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on St. Peter's day, the 29th of June, and a great one, called the Marymas Market, which begins about the latter end of August, and continues for ten days. It is pleasantly situate at the head of a spacious Bay, on the \u00c6stuary of the river Thurso. The air, for about eight months ofthe year, is keen and piercing, but pure and healthy : and the weather is, in general, dry, unless when the wind blows from the East or South-West, which frequently bring rain. The Town is a Burgh of Barony, holding of Sir John Sinclair, Bart., as immediate Superior: The Charter of erection was granted by Charles the First in 1633,"], [742, "T H U in favour of John, Master of Berriedale, by which it was entitled \" to all the Privileges, Immunities, and Jurisdictions, belonging to a Free Borough of Barony in Scotland\" It is governed by two Baillies, and twelve Counsellors, who are not elected annually, but continue in office during the Superior's plea sure. As a Corporation, the Town has no Revenue : the customs ofthe Public Markets and Fairs being let for a small yearly rent, which belongs to the Superior. A General Post-Office is established here : and for the convenience of Trade, there is a branch of The Bank of Scotland. The principal manu facture of the Town is coarse linen cloth : in the neighbourhood is a Bleach field, and a Tannery, both of which are prosperous. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees : The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have also a School here, under the management of a faithful, attentive, and diligent teacher: Besides which, there are some private Schools. The duties arising from the Customs collected at this Port, are not sufficient to defray the expense of the establishment ; which consists of a Col lector, Comptroller, Land-Surveyor, Land- Waiter, two established Tidesraen, and one extraordinary Tidesman ; but the coasting trade is considerably on the increase. The present establishment of the Excise department at Thurso, including the County, consists of a Collector, who likewise officiates as Super visor for the County, and five Officers. The Distributor of Stamps for Caith ness also resides in Thurso. The Harbour, in its present state, admits vessels of 10 feet draught of water at stream-tides, and after crossing the bar they lie in perfect safety; but, for want of a Pier, they can only load or unload at low water. By the Report from The Committee on the Funds arising from The Forfeited Estates in Scotland, in 1806, it appears, that an Act was passed in the year 1802, for erecting a Harbour at Thurso, the expense of which it was expected would have been defrayed by private Subscription ; but owing to the very exten sive Commercial failures which have taken place there, all expectation of having a Harbour erected at the expense of private individuals solely has been given up. This circumstance is the more to be regretted, as a Harbour at Thurso would be of infinite consequence to the Northern Fisheries. This Town is the only one that exists at present, in the very extensive tract of country, from Duncan's-Bay Head to Cape Wrath, and indeed for many leagues lo the Westward ; all of which territory would be materially benefited by any increase to the Commerce, Manufactures, and Prosperity of this Town. Apian ofthe Harbour was drawn up by Mr. Telford, the total expense of which exceeded \u00a37000; but, if"], [743, "T H U \u00a34000. were advanced from the Balances of The Forfeited Estates, the remainder would be raised by voluntary subscription. The salmon fishing in the river Thurso, which is the exclusive property of Sir John Sinclair, is of great value : and the white fisheries along the coast are prosecuted with much success. The fuel most generally used, is peat and turf; but, of late years, coal has become the favourite fire with the opulent. Here are two very good Inns. The Parish of Thurso extends about three miles around the Town in every direction, except towards the North-West, where it is bounded by the sea: there is also a separate District, called Dorary, which, though at a considerable distance from Thurso, forms a part of the Parish. The surface, for the most part is level, interspersed with small eminences, and watered by the river Thurso, presenting a rich prospect of well cultivated fields, and pleasant villas. The sea-coast is in general rocky ; but Thurso Bay, towards Scrabster, is sandy, being sheltered on the West by Holburn-Head, and on the East by Dunnet-Head, from the tre mendous waves of the Pentland Firth. The rocks that bound the coast from Holburn-Head to Brims Castle, exhibit various scenes of natural grandeur. The Clett is an insulated Rock, about 160 yards long and 80 yards broad ; it is elevated about 400 feet above the surface of the sea, and, during the season of incubation, is frequented by innumerable flocks of sea-fowls. Thurso East, anciently called Thurso Castle, once the residence of The Earls of Caithness, is now the Seat of The Right Honourable Sir John Sinclair, Bart., of Ulbster, and a Native of Thurso : a Gentleman, whose merits the page of History records with lasting honour, and whose incomparable exertions will ever be revered by men of Science for \" The Statistical Account of Scotland :\" in the Park are the ruins ofa small Chapel, where Earl Harold the Younger was buried : and near it is Earl Harold's Tomb, a neat modern monument, erected by Sir John. The Bishop of Caithness had a strong Castle at Scrabster, called the Castle of Bumside, which was built in the Thirteenth century, by Gilbert Murray, Bishop of Caithness : its ruins are still extant : Since the Reformation, The Bishop of Caithness lived in a small house at Scrabster, which now belongs to the Crown. There was also another Castle at Ormly, lately demolished. The late Earl of Caithness had a modern House at Hamer. An old Tower still remains at Brines, about three miles West from Thurso ; where there was also a Chapel. A line of road from Wick to this place, a distance of 20\u00a3 miles, has been surveyed, which it is hoped will be carried into effect, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners."], [744, "T I B TIBBERMUIR, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 8 chalders ofbear and meal, 35. Sterling, and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements: the manse was built in 1744: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Crown : The Church is old, but in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1306, and, in 1811, was 1587. It is 4j m. W. from Perth. This Parish contains about 4670 Scotch acres ; of which, about 4289 are under cultivation. Great improvements in agriculture have been made here, by the patriotic exertions and liberal treatment of The (late) Earl of Kinnoul, to whom, and the Duke of Athol, the. whole Parish belongs, except about 500 acres. It is watered by the river Almond, upon which several manufactories are established : and from whence a very ancient canal is conducted to the Town of Perth. Fuel is expensive. The air is moist, but not unhealthy. The roads are bad. Huntingtower Castle, which is delightfully situate on the Southern bank of the Almond, was the ancient Seat of the Ruth- ven or Gowrie 'Family ; and the place, where King James the Sixth was, in 1582, for some time confined by the Earl of Gowrie, and the Confederated Lords ; this enterprise is usually styled by Historians, \" The Raid of Ruthven ;\" those concerned in it were afterwards declared guilty of High Treason, and to obliterate every trace ofthe family, the original name of Ruthven was changed to that of Huntingtower. An extraordinary exploit of a fair Lady has also added to the celebrity of this Castle, and has given the name of \" The Maiden's Leap,\" to the space between its two Towers, which, though now united by buildings, were originally separate. After the forfeiture ofthe last Earl of Gowrie, this Castle and the adjoining Manor, were bestowed by King James the Sixth upon the family of Tullibardine, now united, by marriage, to the Illustrious family of Athol, in whose possession they still remain. But such is the change in the circumstances ofthe place, concurring with the genius ofthe times, that the same Castle, in which the proud and powerful Baron once confined his Sovereign as a prisoner, is now quietly occupied by a colony of Calico-Printers. Huntingtower gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble family of Tollemache, Earl of Dysart. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. At Tullilum, in the Eastern extremity of the Parish, are the remains of a convent of Carmelites, erected by Richard, Bishop of Dunkeld, in 1262 ; and where the Synods ofthe Diocese of Dunkeld were holden until the year 1460, when Thomas Lauder, Bishop of Dunkeld, removed them to his own Cathedral. Upon an adjacent moor, the"], [745, "T I L first battle was fought been The Marquis of Montrose and The Covenanters, in which the latter were completely defeated. TIBBERS CASTLE, v. PENPONT. TILLICOULTRY, in the Shire of Clackmannan : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3120. Scotch, including the allowance for Com munion elements, 34 bolls of oats, 24 bolls of barley, and 6 bolls of meal: the Minister has also the privilege of Craig leave coals, that is, free coals, except paying the collier the price of working them, and he has likewise property in the hills for maintaining seven or eight sheep : the present glebe lies in four different places, and consists of 13 acres : the manse was rebuilt in 1766 : the old manse has long been converted into a stable, and the old glebe is an orchard : Patron, James Bruce, Esq. : the new Church was built in 1773, and is situate near the manse, almost equi-distant from the three villages : it is a small neat, building, well lighted, but not very commodiously seated : there are two Church-yards, one where the old Church was situate, and the other at the new Church. It is in the Presbytery of Dunblane, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Coals-Naughton, Earl's-Town, and Wester-Town) was 916, and, in 1811, was 1025. It is 4m. N. N. E. from Alloa. This Parish contains upwards of 6000 Scotch acres ; of which, 4000 are in the Ochils, and the remaining 2000 form the low arable ground, at the foot ofthe mountains : the soil is in general dry, and fertile ; and agriculture is much attended to here. The multure is no less than the thirteenth peck. Bencleugh, the property of Mr. Johnston, the highest of the Ochils, is 2300 feet above the level ofthe Forth. The whole Parish, South ofthe Hills, abounds with coal, which is the property of Mr. Bruce, except that in Mr. John ston's estate. The great coal, when led to the shore of Alloa for exportation, pays a tax of 4d. Sterling per chalder to the family of Marr, called Gale Mail: it was originally demanded for the liberty of exporting the coal from Tke Pow of Alloa, and because the road leading through the estate to the harbour was a pri vate one, though used by the public : this road is repaired by Mr. Erskine at a considerable annual expense. The Devon is a beautiful river, abounding with fish ; and the valley, through which it passes, is esteemed the Tempe of Scot land : it frequently swells with rain, and overflows its banks. The air is healthy, dry, and warm. It has long been famous for a species of manufacture, called Tillicoultry Serge, a kind of Shalloon, having worsted warp and yam waft. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, which is inconveniently situate at Wester- vol. h. 5 A"], [746, "T I N Town, is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees and perquisites, and a dwelling-house and garden. Tillicoultry pays an annual feu-duty of \u00a37..6..0. Sterling, and 166 bolls of salt, called King's Malt : this is a part ofthe Lord ship of Stirling, having been originally paid at the Castle of Stirling, for the use of the King's family; but was transferred, at an early period, to The Earl of Marr, as a security for some money lent to the Crown. The chief Mansions are Tillicoultry House, one ofthe seats of James Bruce, Esq., in whose family this estate is now strictly entailed ; the entail of the Estate of Kinross having been tranferred by Act of Parliament to Tillicoultry. \u2014 and Harvieston, the seat of John Tait, Esq., whose patriotic improvements deserve the greatest praise. Mr. Bruce is Titular of the Teinds, and all the Heritors and Feuers hold of him. TILLYFOUR, v. OYNE. TINGWALL, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland i formerly a Vicarage and Archdeaconry, to which are united the Parishes of Weisdale, and Whiteness : the Stipend, in 1811, being \u00a3578.. 16.. 0. Scotch in money, and 108 lisponds of butter each computed at SOlbs., together with \u00a340. Scotch for Communion elements, and a manse : Patron, Lord Dundas : There are two places of Public Worship, at the distance of three miles from each other, which are regularly attended by the Minister, and by the inhabitants in their respective neighbourhoods. It is in the Presbytery of Shetland, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of these United Parishes, in 1801, was 1863, and, in 1811, was 1927. The United Parishes are about 10 miles in length, and in some places 5 miles in breadth ; besides some detached Islands, which are inhabited by Fishermen, and some of which are four miles distant from Tingwall, being separated by a dangerous sea. This remote Parish is celebrated in the Ecclesiastical Annals of Scotland, for its process of augmentation, on the decision of which, in a great measure, depended the income of the Ministers of Scotland: the question was very warmly litigated before the Court of Session, and was afterwards appealed to The House of Lords, by whom it was decided favourably to the wishes ofthe Clergy. Like the rest ofthe Shetland Isles, the soil, though not unfruitful, is badly cultivated, and is consequently unproductive. Tbe principal Harbours are, the Bays of Laxfirth, and Scalloicay ; at the latter of which, is the ancient Village ofthe same name, and at the South-East end thereof, is the ruinous Castle of Scalloway, which was built in 1601, by Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney. It is much intersected by Voes or Inlets ofthe sea ;"], [747, "T I N and there are several fresh water Lakes, in one of which is a small Island, called Lawting, where, it is said, justice was formerly administered : a range of step ping-stones leading through the most shallow part of the Lake, to this green holm, remains to this day ; and these stones are of such size, as to evince more than ordinary exertion and expense in placing them there. The Bay of Laxfirth is significative of its name, and abounds with salmon. See, Scal loway. TINIAN, v. TORRYBURN. TINNIS HILL, v. CASTLE-TOWN. TINTO HILL, v. CARMICHAEL, and TINTO.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 980, and, in 1811, was 1204. It is 5 m. N. E. from Dumfries. The United Parishes are about 6 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth: the greater part is arable, and very fertile. A gently rising ridge, running from North to South, divides the United Parishes. The air is dry, and healthy. The Public road is in good repair ; but the Private Roads are bad. On the North-East border of the Parish stands Amisfield House, a Seat of the Earl of Wemyss : this has, from a very early period, been the Baronial Castle and Residence ofthe ancient Family of Charteris : one of whom, Robert de Charteris, is mentioned in History as early as the reign of William the Lion, in 1165. The Castle or Tower of Amisfield consists of a Quadrangle, having a high tower of a very picturesque form on the South-West, and a more modern building, now the Dwelling-house, on the East. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. The Village of Amisfield was erected into a Burgh of Barony by Charles the First, with weekly Markets, and yearly Fairs. A branch of the great Roman Road from Burnsicark passing through it, terminates in the Parish of Dunscore: and near Amisfield, are distinct vestiges ofa Roman Fort. There are also the traces ofa British fort on the summit of Bar sell Hill, about a mile from the Church. Antiquities of various kinds are frequently discovered in the Lochar Moss, which appears to have been formerly an arm of the sea: And Tinwald Isles are said, in a Spanish History, to have been the best Harbour in Scotland. 5 A2"], [748, "T I R TINWALD HILL, v.

For the Western District. - - 1848. 3186. It is 36 m. W. from Tobermory. The Island of Tir-Y is about 11 miles in length, and 2| miles in breadth. The coast is mostly rocky, and intersected with many beautiful sandy Bays, especially the Bay of Gott, which affords safe anchorage for large vessels. About one half of the surface is arable, interspersed with small rocks and rising grounds, none of which are more than 250 feet above the level of the sea ; and its surface is in general so even, that its ancient name was Rioghachd bar so thuin, i. e. The Kingdom whose summits are lower than the waves ; and this name, still used in the popular tales of the Hebrides, describes the low situation of the Island, as the waves are often seen from the one shore rising apparently several feet above the level ofthe other. In the middle of the Island there is a large and very beautiful plain, which contains 1200 Scotch acres, and is elevated about six feet only above high-water mark : during stormy weather the sea often meets across this plain, and is productive of bad conse quences. The inhabitants have endeavoured to avert this evil by building a defence of stone and earth on the one side, while the sea on the other, has raised a considerable barrier of bowlder stones : yet neither have been sufficient to resist the waves of the Atlantic. There are several Lakes, which cover in all about 600 acres ; and upon one of them are the ruins of an ancient Castle, on the site of which a neat house has been erected for the residence ofthe factor of The Duke of Argyle, who is Proprietor ofthe whole Island. The soil is sandy, and the crops are very precarious. The Fisheries employ a number of hands, as well as the manufacture of kelp ; of which, about 245 tons are annually made. The Hill of Cean-Mharra, the West point ofthe Island, is remarkable for the number"], [749, "T O B of caves, which, during the season of incubation, are frequented by innumerable flocks of aquatic birds. The climate is exceedingly rainy. Fuel is expensive. There are the remains of many Danish forts ; and also of several old Chapels., at some of which, burying-grounds and crosses are still visible. In the time of St. Columba, this appears to have been part of the patrimony of that Church, and to have supplied that famous Seat of Learning with considerable quantities of grain ; and at Sorbie, was the mother Church of the Deanry of the Isles. Here is a Parochial School, and also one ofthe Society's Schools, both of which are well attended. There is a regular Ferry from Tir-Y to Coll, 3 miles distant, which is often dangerous, owing to a heavy swell from the Atlantic, and to a rapid current and breakers, over rocks and shifting sands : from Coll there is a stated Ferry to the harbour of Croig, in Mull. This Island appears to have been formerly joined to tbe Island of Coll : the Isle of Guna, which lies in the Sound, being apparently part ofthe intermediate land, which has escaped destruction. On this account, there is but little difference in their composition ; the greater part of Tir-Y being formed of strata of hornblende rock, gneiss, and sienite, which are iu general very much elevated. At a Farm, called Belephetrich, im mediately upon the sea-shore, is a Quarry of beautifully variegated marble. One of the Scotch Honours of The Duke of Argyle is Lord Tyrie. See, Mull, Isle. TOBERMORY, or TOBER MOIRE, in the Isle of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Kill-Ninian. This is a flourishing Village, built in 1788, by The British Society for the encouragement of Fish- eries ; who have a property of about 2000 acres round the place, but the far greater part is hill or moss ; and the ground fit for tillage, lying in detached spots near the Harbour, is not considerable either for extent or quality. In 1791, a Custom-House, and Post-Office, were established here ; and a Sheriff-Sub- stitute Court has also been erected, for the regular administration of justice. The Harbour, which is sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean by the small Isle of Calve, is safe, and capacious ; and is situate in the tract ofthe Shipping, which pass from the Western parts of Britain to the Northern Countries of Europe, and has an easy communication bv water with the fishing Lochs in one direction and with the Firth of Clyde, Liverpool, and other considerable towns, in the other. A Boat- builder, and a cooper, find constant employment ; and there is also a considera ble store of salt kept here, for supplying the busses and boats during the fishing season.

A General Post-Office is estab lished here. This Parish is about 11 miles in length, and nearly of the same breadth: of which, however, only 714 acres are arable, the remainder being pasture or entirely waste. A semicircular chain of mountains passes nearly through the middle of the Parish ; the principal of which are Knoc-Rheacadan, Ben Laoghal, and Ben Hope, the two latter constituting a part of Lord Reay's extensive Forest, in which there are supposed to be about 2000 deer. Ben Laoghal is also famed in the songs of the Bards, as the scene of the death of Dermid. Loch Laoghal is four miles long, and one mile broad : from whence the river Torrisdale takes its rise, and discharges itself into the North Sea at Tor risdale, where the channel is about twenty yards wide, and the water 13 feet deep at Spring tides. From the foot of Ben Hope to the Whiting Head on the West, and as far as Tongue Bay on the East, Tlie Maine, a long tract of hilly desert, covered with dark heath, and interspersed with greyish rocks, impassable bogs, and stagnant pools of brownish water, presents a prospect uniformly rugged and dreary. The Coast is high and rocky, and is intersected by several small creeks ; in one of which, called Port Vaisgaig, is a quarry of grey slate, and another of excellent flags, both of them easily worked, which are conveyed by boats to dif ferent parts ofthe country. The rocks along the coast are hollowed into numer ous caves ; the largest of which, Uaidhe-Mhor-Fhraisgill, i. e. The Great Cave of Fraisgill, is 20 feet wide at the entrance, and extends more than half a mile into the interior : it is frequented by Numbers of seals. The tides follow the direction of the coast nearly from East to West. Game, and aquatic birds of all kinds, are abundant. There is a Salmon fishing on the Torrisdale ; but the other fisheries are prosecuted by the inhabitants only for their own use, especi ally cockles ofthe finest kind. The peat-mosses are very extensive ; and, in the winter nights, the moss-fir, when dried and cut into stakes, affords a strong, though not a clear light, and is used instead of candles. The Parochial and Grammar School is situate at a short distance from the Church, on the banks of the little river Rhians, near the arm of the Northern Ocean, called The Bay of Tongue, which divides the parish into two distinct parts ; the Salary is 300 merks, together with a School-room, perquisites, and a rood of land. The Gaelic is the language generally spoken here. Personal services have very"], [752, "TON humanely and properly been converted into money. There are several cairns, and circular buildings ; at Melness are the remains of an ancient edifice, called t)unBhuidh. i. e. The Yellow Heap, which is supposed to have been erected by Dornadilla, King ofthe Scotch ; and, on the Western side of the Bay, is The House of Tongue, a beautiful Seat of the Ancient and Noble Family of Mackay, Lord Reay, who is sole Proprietor ofthe Parish, and whose ancestors expelled the Danes from these parts. In Drim na Coub there was a skirmish between Lord Reay's men, and a number of Frenchmen who were on board the Hazard Sloop of War, in 1746; when some of the French were killed, and the rest taken prisoners. An excellent line of road has been made from the Ferry over the Dornoch Firth at Criech, through the middle of the County of Sutherland, to this place, a distance of 50^ miles, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners. The principal Islands belonging to this Parish are, Ealan na Coombe, Ealan na Roan, and Tlie Rabbit Island.

It is in the Presbytery of Kirk cudbright, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 636, and, in 1811, was 802. It is 2 m. N. from Kirkcudbright. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and from three to four miles at its Northern extremity, gradually decreasing towards the South, where the rivers Tarff aud Dee unite, and by which it is bounded on the East and West. The middle ofthe Parish is occupied by a long ridge of high land, which gently de clines towards the banks ofthe rivers, where there is a considerable quantity of meadow ground : the soil is in general fertile, and the system of agriculture is much improved. The air is pure, dry, and very salubrious. Over the water of Tarff there are two bridges ; one about the middle of the Parish, where the great Military Road from Carlisle to Port-Patrick crosses it, and another farther South near its extremity, where it joins with the river Dee, and where there is a harbour for vessels of 200 tons burden. There is also a bridge of two arches over the Dee, a little South of the Church and manse ; and where there is one ofthe grandest cataracts in the South of Scotland: this has always been so much admired, that it has called forth the attention ofthe Scottish miise, in the ancient"], [753, "TOR and beautiful Poem of \" Tlie Cherrie and the Slae,\" composed by Captain Alexander Montgomery, who lived in the neighbourhood, at Cranston Castle. These rivers abound with salmon of the richest, and most delicate flavour. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a free house and garden. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. The cross-roads are in pretty good repair. Contiguous to the Church, are the ruins of the Priory, which was founded in the latter end of the Twelfth century, by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, for monks of the Pr\u00e6monstratensian Order, brought hither from Cockersand, in Lancashire. Lesly jocosely relates, that an Abbot of this place undertaking to be in France before the King's ambassadors who were going thi ther, by flying in the air, and accordingly taking his flight from the walls of the Castle of Stirling, met with a reward suitable to the nature of the enterprise, by falling, and breaking his thigh bones.

A Market for horses is holden here on the 21st of August. From the landing place at Achnacraig, along the coast to Aros, a distance of about 20 measured miles, the road has lately been made ; and, in that space, there are five stone bridges, be sides the bridge over the water of Ba, or of Knock, which branches off from it. Game, of various kinds, are in abundance. On a small eminence, at the soot of the Mountain of Beinmore, is the residence of Mr. Campbell, of Knock, who has been at a considerable expense in improving and embellishing his estate. LTpon a lofty Promontory, overhanging the Sound of Mull, stands Castle Duart, formerly the residence of the Macleans, of Mull and Morvern; but now garri soned by a Lieutenant and a detachment from Fort William, to repress smug gling. \u2014 \" It was no long voyage to Mull (from I-Colm-Kill),\" says Dr. Johnson, in his Journey to the Western Islands, \" where, under Sir Allan Maclean's protection, we landed in the evening, and were entertained for the night by Mr. Maclean, a Minister that lives upon the coast, whose elegance of conversation, and strength of judgment, would make him conspicuous in places of greater celebrity.

This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth on the average. The general appearance is hilly, particularly so at the East end, where the Hill, called Cairn Naple, is situate, and which is elevated 1498 feet above the level of the sea : except the hilly part, the Eastern district is, however, the most fertile ; the soil gradually degenerating into a wet muir towards the West. About a mile to the North-East of the village of Torphichen, is a small Loch, abounding with pike, perch, and eels ; the waters of which are discharged into the Avon. The greater part of the Parish is inclosed ; and where the land is unfit for cultivation, considerable plantations have lately been made. Coal is abundant ; and there is also plenty of excellent free-stone. Here are several seams of iron-stone, very rich in metal : and near the village, is a strong Chaly beate Spring, which was formerly much frequented. The Roads are bad. The Hospital or Preceptory of Torphichen, long the principal Residence of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, was sounded in 1 120 by King David the First : the Choir, and a square Tower, are the only remains of it, and are fine speci mens of the elegance and beauty of the architecture : it had the privilege of Sanctuary ; and there is a stone in the Church-yard as a centre, and others at the distance ofa mile, East, West, North, and South, with a St. John's Cross upon them, and which stand about two feet above the surface. At the Refor mation, the vast Estates of that opulent Order were converted into a Temporal Lordship, in favour of Sir James Sandilands, Lord St. John of Jerusalem ; in which Noble Family the title of Lord Torphichen still remains. Torphichen was also of old a Regality, which belonged to The Knights of Jerusalem ; and which, as it was transferred, with the rights of the Order to Lord Torphichen, in January 1563-4, was claimed by a descendant, as an Hereditary Jurisdiction ; and compensation was granted to his Lordship, in 1747, to the amount of \u00a3134. .12.. 6. A similar Cross to that ofthe Templars, was put upon all the Houses that were feued out by these Knights : wherefore the several buildings which we see in Edinburgh and Leith, with crosses upon their tops, formerly belonged to them, and are as yet subject to the Jurisdiction of those who acquired them at the Reformation.

Bridge-House Castle was the ancient seat of The Earl of Linlithgow-, and the Baronial Mansion of the Regality of Ogleface, while his family was free from forfeiture. Robert the Third granted to the Canons of Holyrood a Regal Juris diction over their Barony of Ogleface.

The Village of Torryburn is pleasantly situate on the Northern shore of the Firth of Forth, and possesses an excellent Harbour. The climate is healthy. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, including the lands which are esteemed quoad sacra. The soil is in general good, and well cultivated ; particularly the Barony of Torry, all of which is inclosed, and in the highest state of improvement. There are several seams of coal, which were once worked to a considerable extent, but have been discontinued for some years. A little to the Northward ofthe Village, is the Mansion-house of Torry, the elegant Seat of Sir William Erskine, Bart. The Parish of Torry seems to have acquired the addition of Burn, from a small stream which runs along the South-East part of it, and divides the two Baronies of Torry, and Crombie ; and hence has communicated the general name to both. In the voyage of Lord Anson round the World, in 1741-3, two persons accompanied his Lordship from this Parish ; and the proportion of prize-money, which fell to the share of one of them, being pretty considerable, on his return home, he purchased a small piece of ground, and built a house upon it, which he called Tinian, after the beautiful and fertile Island of that name in the Pacific Ocean, and to which the crew of the Centurion, the Commodore's ship, and the only remaining one ofthe squadron, owed their preservation. Opposite to Torryburn, in the middle of the Firth, is the small Island, now called Preston Island, where coal is wrought to a consider able extent, below the bed of the sea, the property of Sir Robert Preston, of Vally field, Bart.

Adjacent to this moss, are extensive pastures and meadows, that are frequently overflowed by the Lochar Water : farther East, is a fine sandy bank of unequal breadth, above which, the soil is rich, and fertile ; and on the Eastern extremity, the ground rises into lofty mountains. The arable land is mostly inclosed, and well cultivated. The climate is healthy. The Public Roads are in good repair. Peat is abundant, but there are no coals. Sir Robert Grierson, Proprietor of an entailed estate, has lately granted leases for 99 years, of certain parts of his lands, for House-steads and gardens : And in consequence thereof, and the ad- vantage of procuring peats at an easy rate from a very large moss in the imme- diate neighbourhood, a considerable number of persons, most of them weavers, have been induced to settle there. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, including the Interest on a capital of \u00a3210., is \u00a317..14..5i;, besides School-fees, and per- quisites. The Village of Torthorwald was erected into a Burgh of Barony by John Lord Carlyle, on the 3d of December 1473. Here are the vestiges of two circular Camps, and a Druidical temple. The old Castle was anciently the property ofthe Torthorald Family, long since extinct. David rfeToRTHORALD swore fealty to King Edward the First at Berwick, on the 4th of August 1291 : an ancient sepulchral tablet of this family, is still remaining against the wall of the Church : The surname of Carlyle, which, according to Douglas, is of very great antiquity in the South of Scotland, is certainly local, and was probably first assumed when the City of Carlisle and the Northern Counties of England were in"], [759, "TOR the possession ofthe Scots. \" Ofthe Family of Carlyle, Lord CarlYle, which is of great antiquity in the Stewartry of Annandale, was Sir William Cairlyle, Knt.,\" according to Crawfurd, \" in the days of RoBERTthe First (1306) who was matched with Margaret Bruce, sister to that King, as is evident from a Grant by that Monarch, Willielmo Cairlyle milite et Margaret\u00e6 sponsce su\u00e6 sororinostr\u00e6 ca- rissim\u0153 de terrisde Crumanstoun.

The family continued in the state of Barons till James the Third called Sir John Cairlyle of Torthor aid, into the number of his Nobility, by the title of Lord Cairlyle of Torthorald, in 1473. He had by the grant ofthe said King, the Lands and Barony of Duncow, then in the Crown by the forfeiture of Robert Lord Boyd, in recompense of his great charge in an Embassy to France, in 1477. His wife was Margaret Douglas, aud dying in the year 1500, his estate and title of Lord descended and came to William, his Grandson and Heir (his own immediate son dying in his life-time), whose son dying without issue, Michael, his brother became his heir. This Lord was on the King's side, in the Minority of James the Sixth, and was one ofthe Peers who bound themselves to maintain his authority, in 1569, which many of them signed, and Lord Michael especially, with his hand at the Pen ; he dying about the year 1580, his estate went to Eli- zabeth, Daughter of William Master of Cairlyle, his Grand-child, and sole heir, who married Sir James Douglas, of Park-Head, in the Shire of Lanark, who was, in her right, created into the Dignity of Lord Carlyle, of Torthorald. He had a son James, who succeeded him , which James Lord Carlyle and Torthorald married Elizabeth Daughter of Sir John Gordon, of Lochenvar, but having no issue, he resigned his honour to William first Earl of Queens- berry, in 1638, who had acquired his estate, and thereby the title became extinct in this family. From the Ancient and Noble family of Carlyle, Lord Carlyle, The Author of this Topographical Dictionary is lineally descended: His Grandfather having removed from Scotland in the beginning of the Eigh teenth Century, when he settled upon a considerable Estate which he purchased at Stilling ton, in the Parish of Red-Marshall, and County Palatine of Durham ; being esteemed the Chief of his Family. \u2014 The Castle after passing through the families of Kirkpatrick, Carlyle, and Douglas Lord Carlyle, thus went into that ofthe first Viscount Drumlanrig, to whose successor it now belongs.

And in the same House was born James Mounsey, M. D,, his Grand-nephew, first physician for many years to the late Catherine, Empress of Russia. TRAILTROW, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Chapelry, now com prehended in the Parish of Cummertrees : The Chapel is demolished, but the Church-yard is still in use ; and here Mr. Murray, of Murray- Thicaite, has a family vault. The Tower of Repentance, a square building, with remarkably thick walls, about 25 feet in height, is situate in the Church-yard. There are various traditions concerning its name, and the motives for erecting it : but as it is placed upon very high ground, and seen at a considerable distance, it was doubtless used as a Watch Tower ; from whence the motions of the English, before The Union of the Crowns, were discerned, and upon which beacons were ljo-hted, to alarm the country on the approach of the enemy ; and accordingly it is mentioned in the Border Laws, by the name of The Watch Tower of Trailtrow, and a Watch was ordered to be kept there.

It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Cockenzie, Elphingstone, Port Seaton, Seaton, St. Clement's Wells, Wester Falside, and The Town of Tranent) was 3046, and, in 1811, was 3036. It is 10 m. E. from Edinburgh, and 380 m. N. b. W. from London. Here is a good Butchers' Mar ket twice a week. It is a neat, pleasant Town, and is exceedingly healthy. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth ; and is divided by the great East road into nearly two equal parts. The surface is level, and, except a small extent of links, and 100 acres of Common, the whole is cultivated : the soil, especially towards the shore, is inferior to none in Scotland. The Sea coast is perfectly flat and sandy, except the rocky ground, where the Villages of Port Seaton, and Cockenzie, are built. The Coast abounds with oyster-beds, but they are nearly exhausted by over-dredging. Coal is abundant, and is worked at three Collieries to a great extent. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. There are also seven other Schools in the Parish, four of which are taught by men, the remaining three by women ; but none of them have any Salary, except one, who is voluntarily paid by the pro prietors, and the residing partner at St. Clement's Wells. The Cross-roads are bad. There is only one spring of water for the supply of the whole Town. After the Reformation, the Parish of Seaton was annexed to that of Tranent, which was thus too much enlarged ; but, it was somewhat reduced, in 1606, by making the Baronies of Preston Grange, and Preston Pans, a new Parish, under the name of Preston. In 1695, the Parish of Tranent was further diminished, by the annexation of the North-East corner of it to the new Parish of Glades- Muir. The most ancient edifice is that of St. German's, now the Seat of David Anderson, Esq. ; and where there was an Hospital, founded before the year 1296 : The Templars had also a Residence at St. German's, which was, long after its suppression, with most of its revenues, bestowed by King James the Fourth upon The King's College of Aberdeen, in 1494. The Battle of Preston, in 1745, was fought partly in this Parish, the scene of action lying about half a"], [763, "T R A mile to the North of the Church : at the West end of which, the remains of Colonel James Gardiner are interred, who died in the Minister's house of the wounds that he received in the engagement : \u2014 \u2014 - \" But Gardiner brave did still behave, Like to a hero bright, man ; His courage true, like him were few, That still despised flight, man ; For king and laws, and country's cause, In honour's bed he lay, man ; His life, but not his courage, fled, While he had breath to draw, man.\" This Gentleman's conduct, however celebrated, according to Mr. Ritson, does not seem to have proceeded so much from the generous ardour of a noble and heroic mind, as from a spirit of Religious enthusiasm, and a bigoted reliance on the Presbyterian doctrine of Predestination, which rendered it a matter of perfect indifference whether he left the field, or remained in it : being deserted by his troop, he was killed by a Highlander, with a Lochaber axe. Colonel Gardiner, having, it is added, when a gay young man, at Paris, made au assignation with a lady, was, as he pretended, not only deterred from keeping his appointment, but thoroughly reclaimed from all such thoughts in future, by an Apparition ! Mr. Ritson styles his nineteenth song, \" Tranent Muir ;\" which is appositely directed to be sung to the Tune of Killycrankie , a memorable Pass, where The Highland Adherents of King James, under the brave Viscount Dundee, had also been victorious, in 1689.

Sterling, 16 bolls of oatmeal, and 8 bolls of bear, together with a good manse, and a glebe of about 11 Scotch acres: Patron, The King, in right of the Archbishop of Glasgow: The Church, which was dedicated to St. Bridget, and was commonly called St. Bride's Kirk, and Kirk-Bride, was rebuilt in 1785. It is in the Presbytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 613, and, in 1811, was 621. It is 6| m. S. E. from Peebles. The present Parish of Traquair consists of the old Parish of St. Bride, and that half of the ancient Parish of Kailzie, which lies on the 5C2"], [764, "T R A Southern side of the Tweed, and to which it was annexed in the year 1674. The river Quair has its rise, and its whole course in the Parish, to which it com- municates its name. The greatest length of the Parish is along the Southern bank ofthe Tweed, which lies in the direction from East to West between 8 and 9 miles : From the Tweed to the source of the Quair is from 4 to 5 miles, being its greatest breadth in the direction from North-East to South-West, and contains 17,290 acres; of which, about 4000 are arable. The figure is very irregular, being frequently intersected by the Parish of Yarrow. It is bounded on the North by the Tweed. The general appearance of the Parish is hilly, rocky, and mountainous. Minchmoor, over which the old road to Selkirk passes, is upwards of 2000 feet above the level of the sea ; and Gumscleugh, and some other heights in the Parish, are elevated at least 200 feet more. The hills, in general, afford excellent pasture for sheep, of which there are about 10,000 in the Parish. The soil in the low grounds is, for the most part, shallow and stony, but tolerably fertile. The air is dry, and healthy. The rivers abound with trout, and salmon. There are five Heritors in the Parish. By far the greatest proportion of the lands belong to The Earl of Traquair, who formerly resided at Traquair House ; but the whole family, for several years past, have been upon The Continent. The money belonging to the Poor, amounts to \u00a3207. , which is laid out at 4 per cent. Interest: and besides this sum, Alexander Brodie, Esq., who was born in this Parish, and is now resident in Carey Street, London, has sent, at different times, considerable sums to be distributed among both such as are upon the Session's- Roll, and to poor Householders : an act and example of Liberality, which is in unison with his general benevolence. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with perquisites, and a free house, and garden. The Inhabitants, in general, speak the old Scottish dialect. The roads are bad : and the distance from coals, and lime, is a great disadvantage. \" The bush aboon Traquair,\" which, in former times might have been a considerable thicket, is now reduced to five lonely trees, that solitarily point out the spot, where love, and its attendant poetry, once probably had their origin. Part of The House of Traquair is of very remote antiquity ; it was built on the banks of the Tweed, and was in the castellated form. There have been several other Tower-Houses in the Parish, one of which is still almost entire at Cardrona. The tradition ofthe country is, that there was a continued chain of these fortified Houses, so situate on both sides"], [765, "T R E of the Tweed, as by lights placed in them, an immediate intimation might be given, of the approach of an enemy. There are several places denominated Chesters, where there are evident marks of lines of circumvallation ; they are mostly circular, and seem rather to have been intended for a security to their cattle against sudden incursions, than regular encampments : tradition dignifies them by the appellation of Roman camps : they are all constructed upon the summits of eminences not easily assailable, and every particular district has its own : their frequency is, perhaps, the best indication of their use. Glendean's banks are remarkable for their extent and precipitous elevation. According to Mr. Chalmers, at the commencement of the Scoto-Saxon period, if not earlier, the Scottish Kings had The Forest of Traquair, with a Castle on the isthmus, which is formed by the junction of the Quair with the Tweed. We first see it mentioned, in record, under David the First. In the Castle here, the successors of David resided, occasionally, until the demise of Alexander the Third. There was a Bailliewick of considerable extent, appurtenant to this Royal Castle, under the shelter of which the village arose. In 1304, Edward the First granted to Ado mar de Valence, the Manor of Traquair, which then appears to have been more opulent, and populous, than Peebles itself. Robert Bruce granted to Sir James Douglas, the Royal Forests of Selkirk, Etterick, and Traquair, as a free Barony. This Forest of Traquair, which was the object of so much desire, and of grant, remained, no doubt, in the family of Douglas, till the forfeiture of the Earl under James the Second. Being in the Crown, the Barony of Traquair was granted, in 1478, by James the Third to James Stewart, the Earl of Buchan, who trans ferred it, in 1491, to his second son, James Stewart, the Progenitor of The Earls of Traquair. Besides the Barony, there seem to have been other lands, within the Forest, which were granted to other proprietors. The Outlaw Mur ray, William de Maravia, had forfeited the lands of Trakware, before the year 1464 ; as they were then granted to William Douglas, of Cluny ; being in the Crown, by the forfeiture of the Outlaw. David the Second granted the Bondage- Lands of Traquir to William Maitland. And Doctor Pennycuick speaks with rapture, \" ofthe pleasant place, or rather Palace of Traquair.\" TRED WALL, ST., CHAPEL, v. PAPA WESTRAY. TREISHNISH, ISLES.\u2014 These are a cluster of small uninhabited Isles, lying to the North-West of Mull, in the Parish of Kill-Ninian, and Shire of Aroyle. The chief of them are Back More, Back Beg, Cairn-Burgh More, Cairn-Burgh Beg, Flada, and Lunga. Cairn-Burgh-More was formerly con-"], [766, "T R O sidered by the natives, as a place of great strength, and its Castle was generally occupied by a small parly : it is a high rock, of considerable extent, and inac cessible on all sides, except by one narrow pass. Cairn-Burgh Beg is a smaller rock near it, and separated by a narrow Sound, to which the same description applies in every respect. These rocks are said to have been the boundary of the two Governments, into which the Hebrides were divided, when subject to the Crown of Denmark, called The Nodoreys and Sudoreys, or The Northern and Southern Isles. In 1249, Cairn-Burgh-More was summoned to surrender to Alexander the Third, who meditated the conquest of these Islands. The Macleans possessed it in 1715, and during the Rebellion of that year, it was taken and re-taken by each party. TRENABY, v. WESTRAY, ISLAND. TRESCO, one of the Scilly Islands : The Church is dedicated to St. Ni cholas. This Island is estimated to contain 880 acres ; and its Resident Popu lation, in 1810, was 440. The principal Town is called Dolphin, probably from Godolphin. Here are the remains of a fortification, called Oliver's Battery, which commands the passage into Grimsby Harbour ; and where the Parliament Forces under General Blake, and Sir George Askew, intent upon reducing Scilly, the last retreat ofthe Cavalliers entrenched themselves. And soon aster the King's party in St. Mary's to the amount of 800 were obliged to capitulate, among whom was the Governor Sir John Granville, afterwards Earl of Bath.

This Parish con tains about 5625 acres, stretching along the Western bank of the river Nith. The surface is partly flat, and partly hilly : the soil is various, but generally light, and fertile. The state of agriculture has lately been very much improved, especially by the patriotic exertions and example of Mr. Currie, of Redbank, and Mr. Maxwell, of Cargen. The river Nith abounds with salmon and sea trout, and is navigable for large vessels, at the Southern part ofthe Parish ; and, about the centre, for small boats, which bring coals and lime from England. The impolitic System, called The Servitude of Tenants, and Baillie Work, is now almost entirely abolished here. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The Society for Propagating Chris tian Knowledge have also established a School here, with a Salary of \u00a310. The air is healthful. Fuel is expensive.

It is \\ m. N. E. from Kincardine. This Parish originally comprehended the Barony of Tulliallan only; but, in 1659, the Barony of Kincardine, the lands of Lurg and Sands, and Kellywood, were disjoined from the Parish of Culross, and annexed to it; and the whole now contains about 2760 acres, the greater part of which is in a high state of cultivation. The climate is mild, and temperate. Coals are abundant. The Roads are bad. Here are several Quarries of excellent free-stone ; especially the Quarry of Lon gannat, which has been in great repute, for time immemorial ; and is exported in considerable quantities, and to distant places. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees and perquisites, and a School house, dwelling, and garden. The ruins of the Castle of Tulliallan, formerly belonging to The Knights of Blackadder, show it to have been a place of great strength : it is now the property of Colonel Erskine, of Carnock, who has highly beautified the Estate by his extensive plantations. TULLIBARDINE, CASTLE, v. BLACKFORD. The Collegiate Church of Tullibardine was founded in Honour of Our Blessed Saviour, for a Provost, and several Prebendaries, by Sir David Murray, of Tullibardine, Ancestor to The Duke of Athol, in 1446. TULLIBODY, in the Shire of Clackmannan ; an ancient Rectory, now comprehended in the Parish of Alloa: There are the remains of an old Church, in which a tomb has been erected for the family of Abercromby, and around it is a large burying ground, still in use. It is 2\\ m. N. W. from Alloa. Here are some fine crofts, which are supposed to have given the name of Tullibothy or Tullibody, i. e. The Croft, ofthe Oath, to the Barony, and the Village, that stands at the head of it. Many new houses have been built here of late. It is situate on the Eastern bank of the river Devon; and, at its confluence with the Forth, has a Pier, where vessels of tolerable burdeu can load and unload with expedition. The Upper and Lower Baronies of Tullibody, or what are called The Carse and Dry-field, contain about 1100 acres. The Tenants pay kains and cess, and are obliged to carry their Farm barley six miles, if required; but this service is rarely exacted : They are subject also to a darg or day's work for every acre, or \\0d. per annum : all multures are abolished. Here is a bridge"], [769, "T U L over the Devon. In the Village is a numerous School, which is patronized by General Abercromby. The respectable branch of the Abercrombies, which settled at Tullibody towards the end of the Seventeenth Century, are descended from the family of Birkinboig in the Shire of Banff, where it has been long estab lished. Here the late General Sir Ralph Abercromby, and Lieutenant Gene ral Sir Robert Abercromby, KB., two very distinguished characters in the Military Memoirs of Great Britain, were born. TULLIDELPH-HALL, v. STRATH-MARTIN. TULLIEBOLE, i. e. Tlie Poets Hill, in the Shire of Kinross : an ancient Parish, now comprehended in the Parish of Fossaway. It is in the Presbytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. It is 4\\ m. W. S. W. from Kinross. This Parish divides the Parish of Fossaway into two parts, extending from the bottom of the Ochil HUls on the North, towards the Cleish Hills on the South ; and, from The Crook of Dovan on the West, to about halfway to Kin ross on the East: and occupies a space of about 3 square miles. This Parish, although in appearance it resembles a level country, when compared with the hills on the North and South ; nevertheless contains the highest grounds of any Parish in the Plain, between Stirling and Kinross. The climate is showery. The Castle of Tulliebole, which was built in the year 1608, is the Family Seat of Moncreiff Wellwood, Esq. ; but it is going fast into disrepair. Considerable Plantations have lately been made here. The greatest Part of this Parish is of a sharp, gravelly soil, and seldom fails in producing good crops of oats, barley, and pease. The Barony of Tulliebole is under the Superiority of Mr. Well wood. The proprietor of Tulliebole had anciently the power of holding a Court of Regality. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 567, and, in 1811, was 571. TULLILUM, v. TIBBERMUIR. TULLOCH, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen: an ancient Parish, now united to the Parishes of Glen-Muick, and Glen-Gairn : This Church, which is termed the Mother Church, is about two miles North- East from Glen-Muick : it is said to have been founded by St. Nethalen, and an annual Meeting ofthe Inhabitants is regularly holden on the 8th of January, in honour of his memory. It is 14 m. W. from Kincardine O'Neil. This Parish is situate on the North side of the Dee, and is the most populous and extensive ofthe three, being 18 miles in length from East to West, and intersected by the Parish of Glen-Gairn at the Crags or Pass of Ballatar, where the tremendous vol. n. 5 D"], [770, "T U L impending rocks threaten the astonished traveller with immediate destruction. This Parish appears to have belonged in the whole, or in part, to The Knights Templars, and where they had a residence. At the foot of the Hill of Culblean, is a beautiful Lake of about three miles in circumference, called Loch Cannor, containing several small Islands, and abounding with pike, and eels, and various kinds of aquatic birds : Upon the largest of the Islands, there formerly stood a small fortress, which is said to have been built, and occasionally occupied as a Hunting Seat by Malcolm Canmore: in this fortress, many ofthe Cummings, in 1335, took shelter after their defeat in the famous battle of Culblean, fought be tween them and the troops of King David Bruce. Soon after the Revolution, a bloodless battle was fought here between the forces of King William under the command of General Mackay, and some Gentlemen ofthe country, with their de pendents ; the latter of whom made such an expeditious retreat, that, in deri sion, it was called The Race of Tulloch. By a Memorial presented to The Com missioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, by Tbe Earl of Aboyne and other great Proprietors, in May 1806, it appear, \" That the river Dee is well known to be the Third in Scotland, and equal in rapidity to the Spey, though not so large. It runs from the high mountains, which divide the Counties of Aberdeen and Inverness, to Aberdeen, a distance of about 70 miles, nearly in a straight line, passing through the Grampians, for the first thirty miles, and thereafter along the North side of these mountains. From the Bridge built by Government in Brae-Mar, to Aberdeen, a distance of fifty-six miles, there are only two Bridges, the nearest of which to Brae-Mar is 37 miles ; and the other within two miles of Aberdeen, on the great Post-road from Edinburgh to that place. It is obvious, therefore, that the intercourse between the South and North of Scot land is very much obstructed by the want of Bridges across this large and rapid river : and so much was this felt so far back as the year 1726, that the Prede cessors of the Memorialists did every thing in their power to procure money enough to build a bridge over the Dee, near to Ballatar, where it passes through the United Parishes of Tulloch, Glen-Gairn, and Glen Muick, but without suc cess. In the year 1776, another attempt was made ; and, by private subscrip tion (chiefly within the County), with the aid only of \u00a3300. from the Board of Forfeited and Annexed Estates, a handsome bridge was begun and completed (after occasioning much trouble and expense) in 1783, where it had been ori ginally intended, and cost \u00a31700. But, unfortunately for the country, to a great extent, both South and North of it, and particularly so to a great part of the"], [771, "T U L Counties of Aberdeen, Angus, and Kincardine, this beautiful and useful bridge was carried away by an uncommon flood, on the 30th of August 1799, and now lies in ruins. Repeated attempts have been made by the Memorialists to raise as much money as would re-build a work, the loss of which is most severely felt ; but, as it would now cost a much larger sum (as will be seen by the Plan, Specification, and Estimate, herewith presented for the inspection ofthe Honour- able Commissioners), from the difference in the expense of labour and materials since the former bridge was built, and the manner in which the foundation of a new Bridge must be executed to prevent a similar disaster, and notwithstand- ing that all ranks of people in the neighbourhood are willing to contribute to the utmost of their abilities, and several Noblemen and Gentlemen who live at a dis- tance have contributed very handsomely, the Memorialists are afraid it will not be possible to re-build this bridge without Public aid.\" \u2014 In their Fourth Report of April 1809, The Commissioners observe, \" The Contributors to Ballatar Bridge, unwilling to incur the delay likely to arise from the difficulty of finding offerers of contract at a reasonable price, determined to undertake the contract themselves, and employ a Sub-Contractor in the work. The situation is 40 miles from Aberdeen, whence tools, workmen, and part ofthe materials were to be procured, and the immediate neighbourhood of the Bridge is thinly inhabited, and affords no accommodation. Difficulties of this sort had caused Mr. Telford in his Estimate to add 30 per cent, to the prices of Masonry on The Caledo- nian Canal : but the offerers of contract for Ballatar Bridge required double that allowance. At length, however, the work was undertaken at the estimated expense by Mr. Simpson, one of the contractors for masonry on The Caledonian Canal ; who has overcome the preliminary difficulties, by building and fur- nishing two houses for the residence of his workmen, of whom from 40 to 50 are employed. The Piers and Abutments are all finished, and centres with suf- ficient arch-stones for two arches are prepared. This Bridge is of granite, and will probably be finished within the present year (1809), though the time allowed by the contract extends to Michaelmas 1811. Some damage to the temporary centering is apprehended from the floats of timber, which it appears was cut in the Forests before the bridge was commenced ; and this may cause some expense, which in equity must, if it occurs, be repaid to the contractor.\" \u2014 In their Fifth Report of April 1811, The Commissioners state, \" According to the expectation expressed in our last Report, the Bridge over the river Dee, at Ballatar was finished and opened for the passage of carriages in November 1809, almost two years before the time limited in the contract. It is built in the firmest 5D2"], [772, "TUN manner, and bids fair to ensure a permanent passsage over the Dee, at a place, where a former bridge yielded to the violence ofthe river in 1799. On casting up the account of expenditure incurred, it is found by Mr. Simpson the contractor, that the country Masons were justified in their refusal to build this bridge for less than 60 per cent, beyond the estimated expense, he having lost Thirteen Hun dred Pounds by the contract. Before Ballatar bridge was thus re-built, the river Dee was unprovided with any bridge for the space of 37 miles from Brae-Mar Eastward ; Ballatar is about 13 miles from Brae-Mar, so that at present the ob struction is reduced to 24 miles Eastward from Ballatar, and even this is found to be a serious inconvenience in the intercourse between the North and South parts ofthe Shire of Aberdeen.\" \u2014 This Bridge is built over the river Dee, near Pananich, and consists of five arches, the water-way being 238 feet. TULLOCH, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Perth. This is a considerable Village, situate on the banks of the ancient Canal from the Almond, where an extensive Bleach-field has long been established. TULLOCH-ARD, MOUNTAIN, v. KINTA1L. TULLYBEAGLES, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Methven. This is a detached Barony ; and from its proximity to Auchtergaven, the resi dent inhabitants have, for a long time, been accustomed to attend Public Wor ship at the Church of Auchtergaven, and to receive Church benefits from the Ministers of that Parish. This Barony belongs to the Family of Aldie. TULLYBELTON, v. LOGIE-BRIDE. TULLY-MURGAN, v. CULSALMOND.

It is pleasantly situate on the banks of the river Deveron, and is a free Burgh of Barony, by Charter from King James in 1511. The principal manufactures are those of linen yarn, thread, and brown linens ; and there is also a considerable bleach field. The present School-house was the Episcopal Chapel in 1745, with a Salary of \u00a3100. Scotch, paid by the proprietors of the Estate of D elg aty, who have the right of Presentation, together with an acre and a half of land, and School-fees, and perquisites. Here was formerly an Hospital belonging to The Knights Templars ; and also an Hospital for 12 poor old Men, founded in 1272, by Cumyn Earl of Buchan, and richly endowed in the succeeding century by King Bobert Bruce. This Parish contains about 16,896 Scotch acres, com prehending For glen of Old Townan, on the opposite bank ofthe river. The soil is in general light, and fertile ; and agricultural improvements have lately been introduced here. Peats are the common fuel. There are several considerable plantations, particularly on the estates of Mr. Garden, of Delgaty and Troup, \u2014 Mr. Duff, of Hatton-Lodge, \u2014 Miss Gordon, of Laithers, \u2014 Colonel Dirom, of Muiresk, \u2014 and Mr. Robinson, of Gask.

Sterling, together with a manse, and glebe : Patron,"], [774, "T W E Scott, of Dunninald : The Church was erected, in 1648, on a small Mount, called Quarter-Knows; and which, as tradition relates, was of old a place of Druid Worship. It is in the Presbytery of Peebles, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 277, and, in 1811, was 254. It is \\ m. E. from Beild. This District anciently formed that part of the Parish of Drummelzier, called Upper Drummelzier, but was erected into a distinct Parish in 1643. It is about 9 miles in length, and in many places as much in breadth. The surface is uneven, but interspersed with some plains, and morasses : many ofthe hills are very beautiful, being covered with grass to their summits ; others have a mixture of heath; and some are of considerable elevation, particularly Hart-Field, and Broad Law, which are about 2800 feet above the level ofthe sea. From the nature ofthe country, it is chiefly applied to the pasturage of sheep ; and is remarkable for the delicate taste, and flavour of its mutton : the arable soil is, indeed, tolerably fertile, but, owing to the heavy rains and early frosts, the crops are precarious. The climate is healthy. The river Tweed has its source at the South-West extremity ofthe Parish, and runs through it in a North-East direction ; it is joined by the waters of Core, Fruid, and Talla, besides several smaller Burns or Rivulets, all of which abound with trout. The High road from Edinburgh to Moffat, and Dumfries, runs through the Parish. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. Some remains of antiquity are still visible near the High road : and, a few miles above The Beild, there are several Cairns. Near Nether Menzion, on the banks ofthe river Fruid, is the grave of Marion Chisholm, who is said to have removed hither from Edinburgh, while the Plague raged there, and to have communicated the pestilential infection to the Inhabitants of three different Farms in the Parish, viz., Nether Menzion, Glencothe, and Fruid, where its effect was very severe. Vestiges of ancient Castles still remain at Oliver Castle, now the seat of Mr. Tweedie, a respectable Heritor : \u2014 at Fruid, where a Family ofthe name of Fraser formerly resided ; \u2014 and, at Hack-Shaw, the seat ofthe ancient Family of Porteus : there was also a Chapel, near Hawk- Shaw, on the Fruid, which is now in ruins, but the Burial-ground is still in use: and where, about the year 1775, a bust of General Monk is said to have been discovered. Mr Grose has preserved a drawing of Tweeds-Muir Church, and the adjacent picturesque Country. According to The Honourable Archibald Fraser, of Lovat, Oliver Fraser, was the Thirteenth Thane of Man, and first Lord of Oliver Castle, which he built in Tweeds-Muir, and called it by his"], [775, "T Y N name ; he lived in the year 1110; it was afterwards erected into a Constabulary, and was always the first called over, in the Roll of Peebles. TWIN-LAW, v. CRANSHAWS.

It is in the Presbytery of Kirkcud bright, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 683, and, in 1811, was 740. It is 2\\ m. N. W. from Kirkcudbright. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the banks of the rivers Dee and Tars, and being bounded by a small Bay of the sea on the South and West. The surface is mostly high land ; and, in general, the soil is light, dry, and fertile, when properly cultivated. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. The river Dee is navigable the whole length of its course through this Parish, and upon which there is a Ferry at Kirkcudbright : The water of Tars is also navigable for vessels of 50 tons burden up to its lower Bridge : these rivers, together with the Burn of Twyneholm, and the Lakes of Glengap, and Trostrie, abound with fish of various kinds. Here are inexhaus tible quantities of shell marl. In the Northern parts of the Parish, peats are abundant ; but, in the lower districts, the mosses being exhausted, coals are imported from Whitehaven, and are generally used. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, including School-fees, is about \u00a335. per annum. The great Military road, from Carlisle to Port-Patrick, passes through the middle of the Parish, which has contributed greatly to the improvement of the country ; besides which, there are other well directed roads , that are kept in good repair. The Bridges are also in good condition. The old Castle of Cumpstone, the property of The Earl of Selkirk, is pleasantly situate near the confluence ofthe rivers Tars, and Dee : and. on the Farm of Nuntoicn, opposite to St. Mary's Isle, is another old building which also belongs to His Lordship. Here are five of those conical hills or moats, that are so frequent in Galloway. TYNDRUM, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Killin. This is a small Village, situate upon the great Western Military road, between Killin and Dalmally, and about 12 miles distant from each place. Here is a tolerable Inn, which is said to be situate the highest of any House in Scotland. See, Rannoch. TYNINGHAM, in the Shire of Hadington: an ancient Rectory, now com-"], [776, "T Y N prehended in the Parish of White-Kirk: The Church, which is now demolished, stood a quarter of a mile below the village, on the North side of the Tyne, in a beautiful field, which has a gentle slope to the water's edge ; and from whence the Church was distant about 300 yards. It enjoyed of old the privilege of Sanctuary. It is watered by the river Tyne, which discharges itself into the German Ocean, on the East. The right of Fishing the Tyne up to the Know- Mill, and the Sea-coast at its mouth, from within a cable's length of West Bams Burn to the water of Peffer, an extent of nearly two miles, belongs solely to The Earl of Hadington : but seals are abundant at the mouth of the river, which are thought, with some probability, to be one cause of the scarcity of fish. The tide flows about two miles up the water, and might be made navigable to that dist ance at no great expense. On the 7th of February 1628, The Earl of Hadington obtained a Charter, under the Great Seal, ofthe lands and Lordship of Tyning ham; which from hence became the Seat of this powerful and prosperous Family, and who, by plantations and other improvements, have highly orna mented their domain, and beautified the country. It is 4| m. W. b. N. from Dunbar. See, White-Kirk. TYNRON, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse, and offices, were built in 1785: the glebe consists ofthe legal extent : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry: The Church is in bad repair. It is in the Presbytery of Penpont, and Synod of Dum fries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 563, and, in 1811, was 574. It is 2| m. N. E. from Minnie-hive. This Parish is about 15 miles in length, and about 4 miles in breadth, on the average. The soil is rather thin, and sandy; and, from the greater part ofthe arable lands being situate on the edge of hills, the crops are neither luxuriant, nor early : it is chiefly calculated for raising and feeding of sheep. The Shinnel, which rises at the upper extre mity of the Parish, runs through the centre, until it discharges itself into the Scarr, when it loses its name : it abounds with trout, and at The Aird Linn, is a fine cascade, which is much admired. Peat is plentiful in the upper part of the Parish ; but the lower part depends chiefly upon coals, brought from San quhar, upwards of 16 miles distant. The Schoolmaster derives an annual Salary of \u00a322., from a bequest of the late John Gibson, Esq. ; which is paid by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge, on the certificate of the Presby tery. The climate is healthy. About one half of the Parish belongs to The Marquis of Queensberry. The Roads are in tolerable repair. A Roman Cause-"], [777, "U D N way runs through the whole length ofthe Parish, along the side ofthe hills ; and the vestiges of fortifications are in many places very distinct. The Doon of Tynron is a beautiful pyramidal hill, on the summit of which are the remains of an ancient Castle that commands a most extensive prospect. TYRIE, v. TIR-Y.

The surface is agreeably diversified with hill and dale ; the soil, when not in the vicinity of moss, is for the most part a fertile reddish coloured loam, pretty deep in the vallies, but shallower on the eminences, and many hundred acres still lie in their natural uncultivated state ; though a consi derable extent has lately been improved on the estates of Sir William Forbes, of Pitsligo, and Mr. Fraser, of Strichen. Peats are in great plenty. Here was formerly a Religious House, which was well known by the name of The White Kirk of Buchan. TYRIE, in the Shire of Sutherland: and in the Parish of Lairg.

In the interior, it is mountainous ; but, along the shore, it is almost flat: and agriculture has lately been much improved here. The air is moist, but not unhealthy. It abounds with Lochs, especially Loch Roag, which affords excellent anchorage for the largest fleets : All kinds of fish are in plenty : and about 140 tons of kelp are annually made here.

It is in the Presbytery of Uist, and Synod of Glen-Elg. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 3010, and, in 1811, (exclusive of the Island of Boreray, which contained 90 person) was 3773. This Island is about 20 miles iu length, and from 12 to 18 miles in breadth. The Western part ofthe Coast which is washed by the Atlantic, is inaccessible to Vessels, or even to Fishing boats, except in the calmest weather, on account ofthe numerous rocks and shoals that surround it : the East coast is also bold, except where it is in tersected by the several inlets ofthe sea, which form safe and commodious Har bours : these are Cheese Bay, Loch Maddie, Loch Evort, Rueheva and Kellin, but the best of them is Loch Maddie, which is well adapted for an excellent Fishing Station, having safe anchorage for vessels of any burden, and an easy outlet with almost any wind. Along the East coast, the ground is barren, moun tainous, and almost uninhabited : the West,' and North parts of the Island (being almost the only parts of it that are cultivated) are low and level for about a mile and a half from the shore, when the surface also becomes muiry, with hills of small height, that are covered with black heath. The cultivated land is mostly a sandy soil, which, as it approaches the Muir-lands, is a thin black loam, lying upon a gravelly or a free-stone bottom. One thirteenth part ofthe grain that is ground at the three mills, is taken by the Millers for multure, and of which they are obliged to pay 180 bolls to the Proprietor. The climate is ex tremely variable, especially during the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes, but it is not unhealthy. There are numerous fresh water Lakes, abounding with ex cellent trout, and frequented by prodigious flocks of aquatic fowls. Lord Mac donald is sole Proprietor of this -Parish, and whose predecessors have been in possession of it for several centuries. There is only one School, with a Salary \"of 300 merks Scotch, and to which the Committee for managing the Royal Bounty add \u00a325. per annum more; it sends one Scholar yearly to the University. 5E2"], [780, "U I s The Fuel used here is peat, which is procured at great labour and expense.

This Parish is, from North-East to South-West, about 30 computed miles, and its greatest breadth may be estimated from 7 to 9 miles. Towards the West, and North-West, where it is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the soil is very light, and sandy, and most part of it is rendered quite useless, by the severity ofthe storms, that blow from the West: further within, is one continued series of swamps, and lakes which abound with the greatest variety ofthe finest trout: and to the Eastward, are high and rugged mountains, covered with heath and a partial degree of verdure, which afford pasturage for black cattle, horses, sheep, and goats, during the Summer and Autumn months : But the grain pro duced in the Island, on an average, does not serve the Inhabitants for nine months in the year. The air is moist and damp, though not unhealthy. The staple commodity of the Parish is kelp, of which about 1100 tons are annually manufactured. It abounds with game of every kind, and is very favourably situate for a Fishing Station. The Heritors are John Macdonald, Esq., of Clanranald, and Colin Macdonald, Esq., of Boisdale. In a District of the Parish, called Benbecula, a Missionary resides, with a Salary of \u00a330. , which is paid by the Trustees for managing the Royal Bounty. The Protestants assemble in two School-houses, which are now in good condition; and the Roman Catholics have three Mass-houses in the Parish. Here are the remains of some Druidical"], [781, "U L V Temples, and also of some ofthe Danish Duns or Forts. The principal Har bours are, Loch Bee, Loch Skiport, Loch Eynort, and Loch Boisdale. The first introduction ofthe kelp manufacture, was into the Island of Uist, about the year 1750, by a Mr. Macleod, who brought it from Ireland, where it had been carried on for several years. The Islands belonging to this Parish, are Benbe cula, Eriskay, Rona, and Wia. See, Skye, Isle. ULBSTER, v. WICK. ULINISH, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Killmuir, Here is one of the Danish Duns or Forts : and also the remains of a place of refuge, built in the time of James the Sixth, by Hu\u00bb;h Macdonald, who was next heir to the dignity and fortune of his Chief, and who justly suffered for engaging in an execrable plot against the Laird's life. There is likewise an extensive Cavern by the sea-side, but it has no echo, as has been reported. ULLAPOOL, in the Shire of Cromarty, though locally situate in the Shire of Ross ; and in the Parish of Loch Broom. It is 216 m. N. N. W. from Edin- burgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This is one of the Fishing Stations belonging to The British Society. The Village was begun to be built in 1788, and has been gradually increasing since that time. It is most ad- vantageously situate for fishing or trade, and holds a central position with respect to the best fishing Lakes on the Western Coast. The Road-stead is safe and commodious, for almost any number of vessels and of any size ; and a good Quay has been built, where they can either load or unload with the greatest ease. The Village being situate upon low ground, is frequently. incommoded by water from the neighbouring hills ; but drains are constructing by order of The Society, who are laudably endeavouring to exhibit a specimen of the great effects of industry, under even a moist climate, without any peculiar richness of soil. There is an excellent line of road from hence to Dingwall, a distance of 38 miles. The Salary of The Society School, which is well attended, is \u00a325. per annum. Lime-stone is abundant ; and in the neighbourhood are extensive peat-mosses. The pier is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0 53' 40\" North, and the Longitude of 5' 2' 52\" W. See, Cromarty. ULVA, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides/and in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle: It constitutes part of the Parish of Kill-Ninian; being separated from Mull by Loch Tuadh, about twomiles across. This Island is of no great extent, is rough and barren, and inhabited by the Macquarrys ; a Clan not"], [782, "U N S powerful nor numerous, but of antiquity, which most other families ave content to reverence. Macquarry is Proprietor both of Ulva, and some adjacent Islands, among which was Staffa, so lately raised to renown by The Right Honour able Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., K. B. \" Of the ancestors of Macquarry,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" who thus lie hid in his unfrequented island, I have found memo rials in all places where they could be expected. Enquiring after the reliques of former manners, I found that in Ulva, and, I think, no where else, is continued the payment of the Mercheta Mulierum; a fine in old times due to the Laird at the marriage ofa virgin. The original of this claim, as of our tenure of Borough English, is variously delivered. It is pleasant to find ancient customs in old families. This payment, like others, was, for want of money, made anciently in the produce ofthe land. Macquarry was used to demand a sheep, for which he now takes a crown, by that inattention to the uncertain proportion between the value and the denomination of money, which has brought much disorder into Europe. A Sheep has always the same power of supplying human wants, but a crown will bring at one time more, at another less. Ulva was not neglected by the piety of ancient times ; it has still to show what was once a Church.\" This Island exhibits the same kind of Basaltic columns as Staffa, though ofa lighter colour than usual ; but they are inferior in size and regularity. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have established a School here. See, Mull, Isle. UNARAY, ISLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of Yell. It is a small, uninhabited Island, situate in Yell Sound. UNICORN ROCK, v. LERWICK. UNST, ISLAND*, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, consisting of the old money Stipend, an augmenta- tion obtained in 1785, and payable in butter, ling, wool, and lai?ibs, a glebe of 12 merks of excellent land, an annuity allowed, in consequence of an agreement by the heritors, and three days work by the Parishioners, may be estimated at upwards of \u00a3160. Sterling; the manse is in bad condition : Patron, Lord Dun- das : The Church, which was built in 1764, and repaired in 1789, stands at a place called Balcasta, at the distance of three miles from the Minister's abode : It should seem, that the ancient Inhabitants of this Island, if not more numerous, must have been at least more religious than the present: for the remains of no fewer than 24 Chapels still subsist here : so late as the year 1740, the Minister was obliged to preach in three different places ofWorship in rotation : and there are"], [783, "U N S six Burying-places in the Island, at the ruins of as many old Kirks. 4t is in the Presbytery of Shetland, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Island, in 1801, (consisting of the North, Middle, and South Parishes) was 2259, and, in 1811, was 2288. This is the most Northern ofthe Shetland Islands ; The Ska of Unst being situ-ite in the Latitude of 60\u00b0 55' North. It extends eight com puted miles-in length from South-West to North-East, and is, in breadth, from two to three miles and a half: its form approaches to an oblong square. In comparison with the other Shetland Isles, Unst is reckoned level, yet its surface is diversified by several extensive ridges of hills ; the most remarkable of which are Saxaforth, towards the North, that is elevated 700 feet above the level ofthe sea, and may be seen 14 leagues off the coast ; and Vallafield, which rises to the height of 600 feet. Among these hills several tracts of level ground are interspersed ; and their summits are still covered with moss, or black peat earth, to the depth of some feet. There are no rivers ; but it contains many small fresh water Lakes ; Loch Cliff, the largest, being two miles long, and nearly half a mile broad. The Sea-coast is indented by many bays and creeks, and several Isles are scattered around it. All the shores, exposed to the main Ocean, especially the Head-lands, are lofty and rocky, tlie highest of them being 60 or 70 fathoms: but the shores of the Bays and Harbours are low, shelving, and sandy. Tlie little Isle of Uyea, about a square mile in extent, and which is inhabited, lies South of Unst, and forms, upon that quarter of this Island, the safe Harbour called Uyea Sound: the passage betwreen Wedderholm, and Uyea Sound is good, though narrow ; there are several rocks, which lie some distance to the South- West of the former, and a sunken Rock to the North of Haas- Grunie, on which the sea breaks in heavy gales of wind, though there is plenty of water over it at all limes ; from the deck of a small Vessel, keeping the top of Muness Castle well in sight above the land,. you will go without the rocks off that point. The Vair always breaks. Ham is a small Creek, in which a Vessel of about ten feet water may lay in safety. There is no passage between Hume Isle, and the Main land, except for small craft at high water. The inner part of Balta Sound, is a very secure Harbour : in Summer time, Ships which intend to go out through the North Passage, often anchor under Balta Island, bringing Buness on with Skoetaing, and the East point of Fetlar on with the South-West point of Balta Island. Haroldswick, and Norwick Bays, are rocky, and dangerous. The tides flow nearly southward, and ebb Northward: the windings of the Coast, how ever, occasion them to vary slightly from these directions. The greatest velocity"], [784, "U N S of the Current in spring tides, is at the rate of 6 miles an hour. Off Lamba- Ness, the North-East point of Unst, and of all Shetland, where there is a free communication between the Atlantic Ocean and the Northern Seas, the current flows with such rapidity, as to rise to a prodigious swell that often proves dangerous to the fishermen, even in calm weather. Around the coast, are a variety of natural caves; one of which, under a promontory of the Hill of Saxaforth, is 300 feet in length, and of considerable height. The soil is, upon the whole, tolerably fertile, even under the worst mode of culture ; and the higher grounds, which are mostly covered with a short, tender heath, afford good pasturage for sheep. The Island is well stocked with black cattle, shelties, sheep, hogs, and rabbits. Otters are numerous ; and seals are sound in great numbers on the shores of Uyea, Haas- Grunie, Weatherholm, and Burra-Firth : the last of which is also frequented by innumerable flocks of migra- tory Birds, whose feathers are an article of considerable value. By the Police ofthe country, a reward of 3s. 4d. may be claimed by every person who kills an Ern or Eagle, 3d. for a Corbie or Raven, and 2d. for a Crow. The Fishery is an important branch of the industry of the inhabitants ; and about 80 tons of cured fish, on an average, have been annually exported from hence. Peats >are almost the only article of fuel used here. This Island provides the tenth part of 100 Seamen whom the Shetland Islands are, by agreement, obliged to furnish to Government for the Royal Navy, upon any extraordinary emergency. The Norse or Norwegian tongue appears to have been the ancient language of this, as well as of the other Shetland Isles : and most of the proper names have their origin in that language : it is now finally extinct, though it subsisted longer here than in any ofthe other Islands. On each side ofthe Island, are the remains of Picts' Houses. At Muness there is a ruinons Feudal Castle, which appears, by an inscription in Saxon characters above the gate, to have been built in the year 1598 by Laurence Bruce ; who is said to have been from Cultmalundie, in the Shire of Perth, and to have fled hither in consequence of having slain a neighbour in an affray. On the East side of the Parish, between Balta Sound and Harolds- wick, there are two high eminences, called The Hoap .- upon one of them is a heap of stones, intermixed with human bones ; they are both precipitous, and are reported to have been plades for the execution of criminals ; and near them, is a ruinous building which is said to have been the Judgement Hall ; a Cause way leads to it from the foot of the rock. On the hill of Crossfield, are some concentric circles of earth and stone, with eminences raised in the middle of"], [785, "U P H them : upon the same hill, there is a small heap of stones in the form of a grave, surrounded with a row of rude pillars. Two ancient obelisks still remain ; one of them, which is near Lund, is a thick and shapeless rock ; the other, near Uyea Sound, seems to have been a mark for directing vessels into that harbour, and is ten feet and a half high, slender and tapering to the top. No roads have yet been made through this Island, either by Statute labour or otherwise. There is no Post-Office here : the only Post-Office, indeed, in Shetland, being at Lerwick, which is 40 miles distant from hence : so that from its remote situatiort, and its little intercourse, especially during winter, with the mother country, the inhabit ants are frequently strangers for many weeks to the greatest National occur rences. In this dreary district there are, however, several handsome modern houses, with small gardens, gravel walks, &c, in a neat style : the principal of which is Belmont, the Seat of Mr. Mowatt, of Garth. In the Kitchen gardens here, an uncommon kind of Artichoke is cultivated: it has numerous, but very small heads, scarcely larger than those ofthe common spear-thistle : the inhabit ants think it more hardy than the large-headed kind, and also superior in flavour. A School was opened here, for the first time, in the end of November 1805. The Calloo, or anas glacialis, named from its Evening call, which resembles the Sound calloo, calloo, arrives from the Arctic Regions in Autumn, and spends the Winter here : great flocks of wild Swans come at the same time, but these generally migrate farther South. UNTHANK, or INTACH, i. e. Lonely or Solitary, in the Shire of Elgin ; and in the Parish of Duffus : Here was formerly a Free Chapel, with its Minister and Stipend independent of the Parsonage of Duffus. It is 4\\ m. N.W. from Elgin. Its retired situation is favourable to the etymology of the name ; and here, and at Ross Isle near to it, there was a College of Monks, of which the Chaplain of Unthank was probably the Provost ; after the Reformation, its lands were annexed to the Crown. UPHALL, anciently STRATH-BROC, in the Shire of Linlithgow: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1812, was \u00a3150 : Patron, The Earl of Buchan : The Church, which was dedicated to St. Nicholas, stood on the North ern side of the Village of Strath-Broc, about 700 yards North-East from the Mansion-House of Kirk- Hill ; but, during the Seventeenth Century, a new Parish Church was built, a mile higher up the vale, at a place called Uphall, whence the Parish obtained its present name. In 1524, Archdeacon Dingwall granted to the Church of Strathbroc, a Mansion, and Yard, called the principal vol. ii. 5 F"], [786, "U R C Mansion of Strath-Broc Wester, with four acres of land, and six acres, called Seiterland, and also an acre, called The Tenand-Land, lying in the Barony of Strath-Broc : this donation was confirmed by a Charter of James the Fifth. It is in the Presbyters' of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 786, and, in 1811, was 800. It is 11m. W. b. S. from Edinburgh. This Parish contains 3120 Scotch acres : the soil is in general a rich clay, upon till ; and many of the lower fields are covered with a rich black loam ; both of which soils are very fertile. The name is said to signify, The Valley of Brocks or Badgers: the Parish consists of a Strath or Vale, through which runs the Brocks-Bum. Upon this rivulet is Brocks-Bum, the only Village in the Parish, which is now increasing rapidly, by the exertions of The Earl of Buchan, the Proprietor, who has let the ground at moderate terms, on building leases of 99 years. Here is a great Annual Fair on the first of August. The Roads are good. A Colliery, the property of Thomas Shairp, Esq., of Houston, is now worked : the coal is of excellent qua- lity, and is sold cheap. In the beginning of the Fourteenth Century, according to Mr. Chalmers, Strath-Broc wras a Barony, in the possession of Sir Reginald le Chene, who left two Daughters, Mariot and Mary, that enjoyed his Estates: Strath-Broc was inherited by Mariot, who, in 1366, settled the half of the Barony of Strath-Broc on her son by her late husband John de Douglas ; and, in 1390, she resigned the other half of the same Barony to Andrew de Keith, one of her sons, by her second husband. Aster various transmissions, that part of the Barony of Strath-Broc, which comprehends the Kirk- Town, was acquired by that eminent lawyer, Sir Lewis Stewart, who flourished under Charles the First; and who transmitted his estate to his son, Sir James, whose daughter, Catherine, carried it to her Husband, Henry Lord Cardross : and the Great- Grandson of this marriage, David Earl of Buchan, now enjoys from them this estate, together with the elegant Residence at Kirk-Hill. There appears to have been a Chapel of old at Bangour, in this Parish : an Estate which was long the inheritance of the Hamiltons ; and which was dignified, at length, by the birth ofthe elegant Poet, William Hamilton, of Bangour. UPLAW-MOOR, in the Shire of Renfrew ; and in the Parish of Neilston. It is 3-j m. S. S. W. from Neilston. This is a small, manufacturing Village. UPPER RANKEILLOR, v. MONIMAIL. UP-SETLINGTON, v.

Sterling, including \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe consists of 5 Scotch acres : Patron, The Earl of Fife : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Margaret, is in good condition. \u2022 It is in the Presbytery of Elgin, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1023, and, in 1811, was 936. It is 4\\ m. N. W. from Fochabers. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, lying along the coast of the Moray Firth, between the rivers Lossie, and Spey; but it contains no Creek, nor landing place of any kind. The North West part is flat, and the soil sandy, rising only a few feet above the level of the sea ; and, in all probability, has been formerly inundated, as there are evident marks of the sea having receded from the coast : the remainder ofthe Parish is more elevated, and of an unequal waving surface. The air is mild, and salubrious. Four-fifths of this Parish are the property of The Earl of Fife, whose plantations cover an extent of 2478 acres, and add much to the beauty and ornament ofthe country: the remainder ofthe Parish belongs to Mr. Innes, of Leuchars, who has taken uncommon pains to improve his estate, and happily with great success. The Roads are in good repair. The Loch of Cotts, which is about a mile in circuit, contains pike only ; it is frequented in winter, by a considerable number of swans ; and, in the spring and autumn, by vast flocks of wild fowls. At the upper part ofthe Parish, there is another Lake, called Loch Nabeau, partly in this parish and partly in that of Llan Bride, which is now surrounded with plantations. The Salary of the Schoolmaster is 12 bolls of oat-meal, and 6 bolls of barley, together with a good School-house, and a rood of land. The Site of the old Priory has lately been converted into an arable field ; and the name of Abbey- WeU, which the country people still give to the Fountain that supplied the Monks with water, is the only memorial of it that now remains. This Priory was founded as early as the year 1125, by David the First, in honour of The Holy Trinity, and was dependent on the Abbey of Dunfermlin ; but soon after the year 1345, it was conjoined to Pluscarden, with which it continued to be united, until the Reformation. The Priory lands were erected into a Regality. In 1565, Alexander Seton was 5F2 '"], [788, "U R Q made Commendator, and, in 1591, created Lord Urquhart, and, in 1605, Earl of Dunfermlin : But the honours being forfeited in 1690, Seton of Barns claimed the Lordship ; and, about the year 1730, it was purchased by the family of Gordon. The House of Innes, one ofthe numerous seats of The Earl of Fife, is a noble Mansion : it was once the residence of the very ancient Family of Innes, whose annals are marked with great calamities. URQUHART, in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Rectory, with the Chapel of Glen-Moriston united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the glebe consists of 6 acres of good land : the manse is ruinous, but the Heritors allow \u00a320. per annum in lieu of it : Patron, The Earl of Seafield : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Mary, is situate at Killmore, near the foot of the Strath of Urquhart, and is in decent repair : The Minister officiates two Sundays out of three at Urquhart, and the third at Meikly, six miles up the country, where there is also a very good Chapel : The duty, in Glen-Moriston, is generally performed by the Missionary Minister of Fort Augustus, who preaches in that Glen once in three weeks ; and where there are two tolerable Meeting-houses : Before the establishment of this Mission, the Minister of Urquhart had to supply every fourth Sunday in Glen-Moriston, which made the Charge extremely fatiguing ; but, it is now only expected, that he goes thither occasionally, except when there is a vacancy in the Mission ; in this event, he goes there regularly once a month : The Service is chiefly in Gaelic, the prevailing language of the country ; nevertheless in Urquhart, especially in the Summer months, English is also preached, but seldom so in Glen-Moriston. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Tarf, and Synod of Glen-El g. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1944, and, in 1811, was 1800. It is 18 m. N E. b. N. from Fort Aguslus. The Parishes of Urquhart, and Glen-Moriston, are 30 miles in length, and from 8 to 12 miles in breadth. The surface is very mountainous, comprehending the two vallies of Urquhart, and Glen-Moriston, which extend in a Westerly direction from Loch Ness, nearly parallel to, and separated from each other by a ridge of lofty mountains : the highest of which is Meals uarmhonie, being elevated 3060 feet above the level ofthe sea. Urquhart is divided into Strath and Braes ; and is, in general, a rich, thought not a deep loam, and uncommonly fruitful. The soil of Glen-Moriston is very inferior to that of Urquhart, being commonly light and sandy. The Family of Glen-Moriston have possessed this part ofthe Parish of Urquhart from the year 1548 ; and which was conveyed to John Grant, of Culcabock, the ancestor of that family, imme-"], [789, "U R Q diately descended from the family of Grant, by Grant of Ballendalloch, to whom it came, by progress, from the Grantee ofthe Crown, in 1509. King James the Fourth gave and granted both the Castle and Lordship of Urq,thart, in feu-farm and heritage, for ever, to John Grant, of Freuchie, the Chief ofthe ancient and powerful family of the Grants, and ancestor to the present Earl of Seafield, for his own and his predecessors' constant, loyal, and stedfast adherence to His Majesty and his Royal Progenitors ; and since that period, this Fort and Lands have remained in possession of the family of Grant. For some time before the year 1509, the Lairds of Grant were the Crown's Chamberlains over these lands, for keeping the peace in these parts ; and had the revenues thereof for their Salary, as the Governors of the Royal Fort or Castle of Urquhart had before them. The Castle of Urquhart, which is now in ruins, was the Seat of the once powerful Cumyns, and was bravely defended against the English, in 1303, and 1334. In the lower end of the valley, on the North side of the Bay of Urquhart, opposite to the ancient Castle, are the remains of a small Religious House, which belonged to The Knights' Templars ; and the place where it stood, is still called Tlie Temple. The rivers are the Moriston, Emeric, and Coiltie, all of which fall into Loch Ness : and in their course, form several magnificent Cas- cades, particularly at Moral in Corrimony, aud at Divach near the lower end of the Valley. There are considerable natural woods, both on The Earl of Seafield's estate in Urquhart, and in Glen-Moriston ; and several large Planta- tions have lately been made. The climate is, upon the whole, moist, but wholesome. Lime is much used as a manure ; and the Proprietors are desirous of promoting improvements, both by premiums and example. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair : and at Borlam, a substantial bridge of three arches has been built over the river Coiltie by The Parliamentary' Commissioners. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, which is within half a mile ofthe Church, is 300 merks, together with a house, School-fees, and some small .perquisites. The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge have also a School in the Braes of Urquhart, with a Salary of \u00a310., and \u00a34. more to the Schoolmaster's wife as a Sewing-mistress: besides which, the Heritors find them in a house, garden, grass for a cow, and fuel, and a small Sum is added by the Quarter pay- ments. The Earl of Seafield has several neat houses, for occasional residence, in this Parish. The House of Corrimony, situate at the Western extremity ofthe Glen, is a good commodious building ; and the estate has been greatly improved by James Grant, Esq., who has made many inclosures, and otherwise embel lished his seat. See, Inver -Moriston."], [790, "URQ URQUHART, partly in the Shire of Nairn, and partly in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Vicarage of Logie Wester united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of barley, and one of meal, 600 merks in money, and 100 merks for Communion elements : besides the glebe in the neighbourhood ofthe manse, which was built in 1777, there is another adjacent to the ruins of the old Church of Logie Wester, and within the improvements at Conan-Side the Proprietors of which place have farmed it for a series of years past: Patron, Mr. Forbes, of Culloden-' The Church was lately re-built, in a different and more eligible situation. It is in the Presbytery of Dingwall, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of the United Parishes was, In 1801. In 1811. For that Part, which is in the Shire of Nairn. - - 1610. 1510. For that Part, which is in the Shire of Ross. - - 2820. 2664. 4430. 4174. It is 2 m. N. E. from Dingwall. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and from 3 to 4 miles in breadth : it lies along the Eastern side of the Firth of Cromarty, and is terminated by the river Conan, which here discharges itself into that arm of the sea. This Parish is divided among three Heritors : \u2014 At Findon, in the Eastern division of it, as an old, but good house, belonging to Sir Roderick Mackenzie, Bart., of Scathe ell ; which is pleasantly situate between the Firth of Cromarty on one side, and a beautiful Oak wood on the other ; but the Proprietor does not reside here : On this Estate, there is a Market Town, on the high road from Dingwall, and the Ferry of Scuddale, to Cro marty : it is provided with an Inn ; and four Fairs are holden here annually : \u2014 The District of Ferintosh or Ferina Toshe, i. e. The Thane's Land, was accord ing to Mr. Nimmo, originally comprehended in the extensive County of Inver ness : it still pays Cess or Land-Tax in that County. In the Fifteenth Century, it was the property of the Thane of Calder, who procured an annexation of that, with other lands, to the County of Nairn ; accordingly, when the Shire of Ross was erected in 1661, this\u00bbDistrict was excepted from it. At the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, this District came under the Jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Ross ; but, in every other respect, it is considered as a part of the Shire of Nairn ; a Justice of Peace, to act there, must be qualified for the Shire of Nairn ; and the inhabitants are summoned to Head Courts, &c, to the Town of Nairn. This inconvenience is peculiarly felt in the execution of the Excise"], [791, "URQ laws. The Estate which now belongs to Forbes, of Culloden, and who, as Baron of Ferintosh, votes in Parliamentary elections for the County of Nairn, was at one time famous for enjoying the privilege of distilling- the barley of its own growth into Spirits, free of any duty ; and, although the right was purchased by Go vernment in 1786, yet, as the skill in the art still remains among the people, it is no uncommon thing to see almost one-half of them summoned at once, to at tend the Courts ofthe Justices of Peace at Nairn. Again, by an unlucky acci dent, the Parish Church is situate within the Ferintosh Estate ; by which means, in the Acts respecting the Militia, &c, the whole united Parishes of Wester Logie and Urquhart, which comprehend a considerable tract to the North and South of Ferintosh, are reckoned in the County of Nairn, and thus an additional population of one- third is given to that small County. This Estate is situate on the South shore of the Conan river and the Firth of Cromarty, a little below the Bridge ; its extent is about 8 square miles. The Boundary to the West is a Burn which falls into the Conan near a Farm, called Tuina' awin, and which passes immediately East of the old Castle of Kinkell. The boundary runs by this Burn, across the high road from Kessock to Scuddale Ferry or Conan Bridge, and to its source on the summit of the hill, near a very remarkable Druidical circle. On tlie summit it extends North-East nearly 5 miles, keeping parallel to, and about 2 miles distant from Conan, it then descends North to the road from Fortrose to Dingwall, turns West by this road half a mile, and finally de scends to the shore, a little East from the Kirk of Urquhart. The extent along the Shore may be about 2^ miles. To the North East of Ferintosh are the Estates of Findon and Kinbeachy in the Shire of Ross, except in the Militia bu siness, when the former is reckoned in Nairn, and the latter in Cromarty. To these succeed Tobirchurn and Craighouse, which, with many other Districts, have been annexed to Cromarty ; but, in cases of Roads, Bridges, &c. are, with Ferintosh, still considered as part of Ross. Beyond this, we find the Old She riffdom of Cromarty as mentioned in the Act of 1661, erecting the Shire of Ross, and which, in many respects, is still considered a distinct Shire. See, Inver ness.\" At Conan-Side, is a handsome modern house, belonging to Sir Hector Mackenzie, of Gairloch, and where he resides occasionally : it is situate on the banks ofthe river Conan, and possesses many natural beauties, which have of late been much improved : on this estate are plantations of firs and forest trees, of considerable extent, and all of them in a flourishing condition. Besides the Parochial School, there are two others, in the more remote districts of the"], [792, "U R R Parish, established by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and to the support of which, the respective Proprietors very laudably contribute. Here are extensive Quarries of Free-stone. Fuel is expensive. The Gaelic is the language commonly spoken, and universally understood in this Parish : the English or Scottish is, however, generally understood by many of the inhabitants ; and Divine Service is performed in both of these languages. At the South-West extremity, on a high but level moor, are several tumuli. At the Eastern extre mity ofthe Parish, and opposite to Foulis, is a Ferry, from whence it takes its name : it is not much frequented, and is incommodious at low water, from the shallowness of the shore : \u2014 towards the West end of the Parish on the river Conan and beyond where the Tide at any time flows, is the Ferry of Scuddale, on the Post Road from Beauly to Dingwall : \u2014 besides these Ferries, there is a small Boat for foot passengers, which at high water, plies between Dingwall and Ferintosh : \u2014 on the tide's retiring, and when the river is low, there is access to Dingwall from this side ofthe water by different fords ; but this is a dangerous passage.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Dalbeattie) was 1719, and, in 1811, was 2388. It is 3-j m. N. E. from Castle-Douglas. This Parish contains nearly 12,000 acres. The soil is in general light, and productive. It is bounded by the Sol way Firth on the South, and by the river Urr on the West which is navigable for vessels of 60 tons burden up to the Village of Dalbeattie, at spring tides. The Climate is healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch; but the large extent of the Parish has occasioned even this small sum to be di vided. The great Military road, from Dumfries to Port Patrick, passes through the Parish. Upon the banks of Loch Urr, the ancient and distinguished Family of Seaton had a Castle, and a very large domain : and at this day the land holders, in that neighbourhood, have most ofthe old investitures of their estates from the Seatons. Sir John Seaton, of Barnes, seems to have sold the remains ofthe family property in Galloway, so late as the year 1596. Within the an cient domain ofthe Honourable family of Herries, are the ruins of several Ro man Catholic Chapels, and the torn -stones of those who perished by Military"], [793, "U R R execution, during the infatuated reign of Charles the Second. These stones have from time to lime been kept in repair, by the friends of that cause in which the sufferers bled ; and whilst there was a Pretender to the throne of Britain, each of these sepulchral monuments was to Government, as good as a consi derable Military force in this part of the country. Tlie Moat of Urr, which is perhaps the largest work ofthe kind in Scotland, is situate on the West bank of the river, about half a mile below the Church. This artificial Mount was, ac cording to tradition, a place of Judicature, or public assembly: and, when Gal loway was an independant State, this was the Court where the Reguli, or petty kings of that District, held their National Councils, and promulga'ed such new laws and regulations as were found necessary from time to time to be enacted : it was also the Seat of Judgment, where capital offenders were tried. At this time Galloway was divided into two Districts, namely above and below the Water of Cree : and The Bloat of Urr was then the great Court of Judicature for the latter. This Mount greatly resembles that of the Tinewald, in The Isle of Man, which was appropriated to the same uses. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. URRAY, partly in the Shire of Ross, and partly in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Kill-Christ united: the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 10 chalders of barley, and a glebe- the manse is old: Patron, The Crown : The Church is an elegant and substantial building.

This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and from 3 to 6 miles in breadih : besides which, there is a Davoch of land belong ing to it in the Valley of Strath Conan, in the bosom ofthe Western Mountains, at the distance of 18 English miles : it is surrounded by the Parish of Contin, and farms a part of the Mission in that Parish. The soil is various ; but, on the whole, is warm, dry, and productive. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The climate is dry, and healthy, it is watered by the rivers Orin, and Conan; the latter of which abounds with salmon, and pike. The Parochial vol. ir. 5 G"], [794, "U Y E School is well attended : besides which, there is a Society's School that is very useful.

This is an Island only at high water, which is separated from the North shore, when the tide is out, by a sand two miles broad. It is a mile and a half in length, and nearly half a mile in breadth ; and the soil is for the most part sandy. It is beautiful, and fertile in corn and grass, when the Summer is rainy, but yields very little of either when the Season is the reverse. In the Winter, and Spring, it is quite barren, the surface being covered with sand, which a gale from the North-West never fails to blow over it.

It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Brothock, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Fishing Village of Auchmilhie) was 4243, and, in 1811, was 4953. It is 1 m. N. from Aber-Brothock, and comprehends a great part ofthe Suburbs of that Town. This Parish contains about 9385 Scotch acres, including the two detached estates of Hospital- Fie I J, and Inver-Peffor ; the whole of which are arable, and mostly inclosed, except about 700 or 800 acres of improvable muir, and plantations. The surface is tolerably level, rising on both sides from the small river Brothock, which divides it nearly into two equal parts. The soil is various ; but, upon the whole, it is fertile, and well cultivated. Most ofthe Estates in this Parish formerly belonged to The Abbey of Arbroath, and were sold by Cardinal Beaton, or given to his friends and rela tions. A variety of Services, and horse corn, are retained in some ofthe estates, which are abo thirled to particular Mills. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a3100. Scotch, together with School -fees, and perquisites, a good dwelling, and School-house, and a small garden. The mauufacture of linen cloth, called Osna burghs, is carried on to a great extent here. The climate is healthy. Upon the coast, there are several large caverns: one of them, called The Maiden Castle Cave, is 231 feet long, and from 12 to 24 feet broad, with a spring of fine, but exceedingly cold water, at its farther end ; and this was wont to be used by The Mason Lodge of Arbroath, as the place for admitting new Members, and whither they walked in procession every year on St. John's day. The Roads are in good repair. St. Vigean,whose grave is shewn to strangers in this Church-yard, is said to have resided, for sometime, about three miles from the place where the Church stands, at a Farm called Grange of Conan, where the vestiges of this Chapel, 27 feet long and 15 feet broad, still remain ; and withjn a few yards of it, is a"], [797, "W A A copious Spring of excellent water, called St. Vigean's Well. It is also worthy of observation, that the South side ofthe Church of Arbroath, for about 10 feet at the East end, and a few feet on the West, stands in this Parish ; and not many years ago, the Minister and School-master of Arbroath resided in it. - VIRVEDRUM Promontorium, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Cairston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801 (containing the North, and South Sides) was 709, and, in 1811, was 769. This Parish constitutes part ofthe Island of Hoy, and, in all proba bility, derives its name from the word Voes, which, in the ancient language of these Islands, signify such Creeks or Bays as penetrate far into the land , and in these, the East side of the Parish abounds ; two of them are called Lyarwoe, and Thurvoe. The West and North parts of this district are mountainous, and"], [798, "W A L afford pasture for some thousands of sheep, together with a number of horses and black cattle. Towards the East and South, the land is more low, more level, and of a much better soil ; which produces grain of the ordinary kinds, but of a superior quality to what is raised in other places in the County. The Lyar Bird abounds here in the season of incubation, when they are taken in great numbers. Commodore James Moodie, who distinguished himself in the service of Her Majesty Queen Anne, was a native of this Parish ; and, who, at an advanced age, was basely murdered in the streets of Kirkwall, bv the hand of an hired assassin. This Parish derives great benefit from the excellence of its Harbours ; these are, the Orehope, the Kirkhope, and particularly the Long/tope; which, for readiness of access, and extent of accommodation, is unequalled ; and this seems now to be generally admitted, for the ships that have occasion to visit these Northern Regions, instead of resorting in crowds to Stromness, as they have done for centuries past, are daily preferring the Longhope, as in every respect better suited to their advantage and convenience. WALLACE HALL, v. CLOSEBURN. WALLACE-TOWN, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr: in the Parish of St. Quivox. This is a populous, and increasing Village, built by the late Sir Thomas Wallace, of Craigie, near the North end of the old Bridge of Ayr. It is principally inhabited by Colliers, and Weavers.

The Parishes of Walls and Sand-Ness are about 7 Scotch miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth : they are much intersected with Voes or inlets of the Sea, which afford safe anchorage to the Fishing vessels. The surface of the ground in Walls, is diversified with small eminences. Throughout the whole Union, the soil is rather thin, and sharp ; and, being mostly cultivated with the spade makes, in general, very good returns. In the inland parts ofthe Parishes a deep moss prevails, and a short heath, affording pasturage for great numbers of skeep and horses, the latter of which run wild. The ground, towards the sea, is hard and verdant ; and hither the sheep repair in the inclemency of winter, to feed on the sea-weed. The Climate is moist, but not unhealthy. Not much kelp is made on these coasts. The Fisheries are principally attended to here. Limestone, free-stone, and slate, are sound in the Parish of Sand-Ness, but they are of an inferior quality. There is a Parochial School in Walls, with a legal Salary, together with a modification of 40s. per annum by The Rev. Mr. Buchan. Peats are the general fuel which are easily procured, and are excellent of their kind. There are the remains of eight Picts' Houses, in this Ministry. Sea-fowls are exceedingly various, and plentiful. Several young men are en gaged every spring- from hence, by the Greenland ships.

This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth: the North-Eastern extremity is mountainous, but that part which lies along the river Annan, is fertile, and well cultivated. Great improvements in agriculture have lately been made here, from the judicious encouragement given to the tenants by The Earl of Hopetoun : by the last leases, they are relieved from the pay ment of multure, and the miller is now paid for his work, about a T/tirthielh part ofthe meal. The situation ofthe Church, and manse, on the winding banks of the Wamphray, water, in a deep and woody recess, is singularly romantick. The air is moist, but not unhealthy. Attempts have been made, but without success, to find coals, and lead. The Sal iry of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. The Mail-Coach, between Glasgow and Carlisle, runs through the Parish daily. Songs are still sung here, descriptive ofthe barbarous deeds and bloody feuds of some former age, of which this Parish was the scene. At Girlh-Head, there isa small Roman post; and there are still the vestiges of a Roman road, by the side of which, a few large stones, each about 5 feet high, are stiil standing, nearlj at the distance ofa Scotch mile from one another, and are, therefore, supposed by some persons to have been Roman mile-stones: near one of them, Charles the Second is said to have passed the night on his way to England, a little before the battle of Worcester. There is also a Druidical circle almost entire. There are considerable tracts of wood, chiefly around the old Castles of Wamphray , and Lochwood ; the latter of which > is the old family seat ofthe Lords of Annandale.

Wauchope Castle, where the old manse stood, was the first residence of the Lindsays, in Scotland. It appears from history, that they originally came into this Country with Malcolm Canmore from the Manor of Lindsai, in the County of Essex, about the begin ning of the Twelfth Century. Having ingratiated themselves with that Prince, when in England, he brought them in his retinue, and conferred upon them the lands of Wauchope- Dale, &c. ; and from them it is supposed, that the family of Crawford, and the other Noble families of that name, deduce their origin.

The whole Parish, except one Farm belonging to Mr. Menzies, of Culdares, is the property of The Earl of Breadalbane, and Sir John Menzies, Bart., of Menzies: the latter of whom has his principal residence at Castle Menzies, a hand some edifice, romantically situate at the foot of the Northern side of Strath Tay, and finely adorned with extensive plantations. The Gaelic language is com monly spoken here. It was formerly usual for the Ministers of Weem and Ken more to officiate, the latter every fifth Sunday, and the former four times a year, at Lowers, on the North side of Loch Tay, where there is a pretty good Chapel which was built by the Earls of Breadalbane : But, a few years ago, The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, out of a fund bequeathed to them by the late Lady Glenorchay, for the purpose of encouraging religion and industry on the estate of Breadalbane, settled two Missionary Ministers, who officiate at Lowers and at Ardeonaig on the South side of Loch Tay: they are allowed \u00a325. per annum by The Society, and as much more by The Earl of Breadalbane, with a house, and piece of land, in name ofa glebe. This esta blishment precludes the necessity of the Ministers of Weem and Kenmore preaching at Lowers, and the Minister of Killin from preaching at Ardeonaig. The Ministers of Forlingal, and Weem, still officiate in Glen Lyon ; the former, once in five or six weeks, the latter, five or six times a year, at a place about 20 statute miles from the Church at Weem ; where a good Chapel was built, a few years ago, by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants of that valley, and some small donations from a few of the neighbouring gentlemen : about one fourth ofthe inhabitants of Glen Lyon are Parishioners of Weem, and have long been remarkable for an exemplary conduct, derived from their Illustrious Chiefs. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a good School-house, dwelling, and a small garden. There are also three other Schools, which are supported from a fund of 6000 merks Scotch, mortified for that purpose by Mr. Archibald Campbell, first Presbyterian Min ister of this Parish, who was admitted about the year 1703 ; the interest of this sum only is employed according to the deed of mortification, for the maintenance of three Schools in the most remote parts ofthe Parish, being about \u00a35..11..1|."], [805, "W E M to each of them : this sum, when it was first given about the year 1740, was sufficient for supporting a youth to teach during seven months in the year, which, at that time, was all that was required, as the inhabitants dispersed through the hills with their cattle in the Month of May, and the Schools did not convene until the harvest was finished : but, since sheep-farming was introduced, the people remain at home the whole year, and the schools are consequently of the same importance in summer as in winter. The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, therefore, with their accustomed liberality, allow the school at Roro, in Glen Lyon, \u00a35. per annum, in addition to the former salary, which enables the Master to teach through the greatest part of the year. These three School masters act likewise as Catechists. The most remarkable Mountain, of which a part belongs to this Parish, is that of Ben Lowers, situate on the Northern bank of Loch Tay, and rising in a conical shape to the height of 4015 feet above the level ofthe sea, by actual measurement. See, Glen Lochay. WEIR, ISLAND, one ofthe Orkneys, and constituting part ofthe Parish of Rousay : The Church is ruinous, around which is a Church-yard where the graves are of an unusual size. It is divided from Rousay by Weir Sound, which affords good anchorage. This is a small low Island, about two miles long, and one mile broad : the soil is good, but the cultivation is very indifferent. Here is abundance of peat-moss. Great quantities of sea-weed are throwrn up here ; and, on the rocks at the West end of it, seals are numerous. At a little distance from the Church, upon an eminence, are the ruins ofthe Castle of Cub berow, which was built by Kolbem Hranga, an Orkney Gentleman, about the middle of the Twelfth century ; it afterwards stood a siege of some months, but was not taken. There are no rats here. WEISDALE, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : An ancient Parish, constituting part ofthe Union of Tingwall. See, Tingwall. WELL-BANK, v. GAIGIE, EASTER.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Buckhaven, East and W'est Coaltowns, Methil, Easter Wemyss, Wester Wemyss, and the Country District, including Kirkland) was 3264, and, in 181 1, was 3691. It is 13 m. N. E. from Dysart. No Market. The Fair is holden on the second Wednesday in September. Here is a considerable Brewery. The village of Easter Wemyss is situate on the Northern Coast ofthe Firth of Forth, but the harbour is insecure, and is only used for Fishing Boats. A great quan tity of linen is manufactured here. The air is often damp and cold, especially when the wind is from the East, but it is not unhealthy. In 1705, George Earl of Cromarty, in testimony of his great affection and honour to the- memory of Margaret, Heiress and Countess of Wemyss, and Countess of Cromarty, his deceased Lady, mortified a small sum of money for founding a Stipend to a Ca techist, for instructing the Colliers and Salters, and others in the Parish of Wemyss; the Salary is \u00a3250.. 3. .4.

The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a School-house, dwelling, and gar den. The Parish of Wemyss is about 6 miles in length, and If mile in breadth. The surface rises precipitously from the shore, after which the whole Parish stretches to the North and is almost level ; it then takes a rise in the center, and becomes level : it is all arable, and, in general, well cultivated. Here are the ruins of an old Castle, commonly called Macduff's Castle, which is said to have been built about the year 1057 by Macduff, who was created Earl of Fife by Malcolm Canmore, and received other distinguished marks of Royal favour: soon after the lands of Easter Wemyss were alienated from the family, and were possessed by the Livingstones, and then by the Colvilles, of Ochiltree; but, after two hundred years separation, they were again added to the estate of Wemyss, by Tbe Right Honourable John Earl of Wemyss, who was High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in 1641 ; and all the lands of Wemyss- Shire now belong to General William Wemyss, the lineal descendant ofthe ancient Earls of Fife. WEMYSS, WESTER, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Wemyss. It is 2 m. E. N. E. from Dysart. This is a Burgh of Barony, belonging to General Wemyss, and is govered by two Baillies, a Trea surer, and Council. It is pleasantly situate on the Northern Coast ofthe Firth of Forth, and has a good harbour. Here are seven Salt-pans. Coals are in"], [807, "WES great abundance, and considerable quantities are annually exported. The Castle of Wester Wemyss is situate upon a Promontory, projecting into the Firth of Forth: it is of great antiquity, and has been rendered a commodious and mag nificent residence by the successive Proprietors. It is celebrated as the place, where Queen Mary had her first interview with The Earl of Darnley, on the 13th of February 1565. The Lands of Wemyss-Shire belonged at a very early period to tbe ancient Earls of Fife, one of whom, Gillimicheal, was witness to the foundation-charter ofthe Abbey of Holyrood-House, in the year 1128 ; since which time, the lands of Wester Wemyss have descended without interruption in the Ancient and Noble Family of Wemyss ; and are now the property of General William Wemyss, Representative in Parliament for the Shire of Fife, who has greatly improved the Castle, and surrounded it with extensive and flourishing Plantations. Wemyss gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Charteris. WEST^BURN, v. CAMBUS-LANG. WEST CHURCH, v. CUTHBERT'S, ST. t WESTER CRAIGS, v. TORPHICHEN. WESTER FEARN, v. DORNOCH.

It is in the Pres bytery of Langholm, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 638, and, in 1811, was 698. It is 6 m. N. W. from Lang holm. This Parish contains 27,307 acres : the general appearance is hilly, being partly covered with heath, though they are mostly green and dry, and afford excellent pasture for sheep : along the banks ofthe Esk, the soil is a light and fertile loam, and well cultivated. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair: for which the Public are indebted to the Patriotic exertions of the late Sir James Johnstone, whose attentions"], [808, "WES were unremitted in the general good. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and some small emoluments. On the farm of Megdale, the property of The Duke of Buccleugh, there is a pit of excellent shell marl ; and, in the year 1788, a rich mine of Antimony was dis covered on the estate of Glendonwyn or Glendenning, belonging to Sir James Johnstone : this mine is worked to a considerable extent, and to accommodate the Miners, the Proprietor has built a neat Village, called James-Town, which is pleasantly situate on the banks of the Megget. In the writs of the family of Glendonwyn, of that Ilk, there is a confirmation of a charter by Archibald Earl of Douglas, mortifying certain of his lands in the Barony of Hawick, for the foundation ofa Chapel in the Parish of Westerker, with a suitable mainte nance for a Chaplain thereto for the safety ofthe Souls of James late Earl of Douglas, and Sir Simon Glendonwyn, who fell in the memorable battle of Otterburn, in 1388: it is dated at Glendonwyn, on the 9th of December, 1391. There are the vestiges of two ancient Castles at Glendonwyn, and Wester- Hall; and near the latter is the elegant seat ofthe same name, the occasional residence of Sir William Pulteney Johnstone, Bart. The family of Wester-Hall have all highly distinguished themselves: \u2014 the celebrated Mr. Pulteney, the undaunt ed and successful opposer of the corrupt Administration of Sir Robert Walpole, was a descendant of it; \u2014 as was also the late Governor Johnstone, whose bravery as an officer, and whose information and eloquence as a Senator, are universally known. This Parish also gave birth to the gallant Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley, who commanded the Van squadron in the glorious action of Earl Howe, on the first of June, 1794. There are vestiges of Roman encamp ments on the summits of several of the hills. WESTER KNOCK FIN, v. STRATH GLASS. WESTER, LOCH, in the Shire of Caithness ; and in the Parish of Wick.

It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population ofthe Island of Westray (containing the North and West Parishes), in 1801, was 1424, and, in 1811, was 1396. It is 20 m. N. from Kirkwall. As Westray terminates the cluster of Islands on the North-West quarter, it probably derives its name from this circumstance. Its shape bears some resemblance to a Cross, the body of which may be estimated at eight, while its arras do not extend above sive miles, and if reduced into a form capable of measurement, it may contain about fourteen square miles. Through this whole extent, which stretches from South-East to North-West, it forms a ridge, low on the shores, and gently elevated towards the middle ; and, from South to North, on the West side, a range of pretty high hills forms its boundary in that direction. The cultivated land, and the principal grass pas ture, are on the East end, and on the North and South shores ; a large portion of it is on the South-West, where both are uncommonly fine ; and, as the waste land lies in the middle of these tracts, what is on the West and North-West is inferior neither in quantity nor quality. Here is soil of every sort ; sand, clay, loam, gravel, yarpha, ora mixture of clay and peat; as may easily be conceived from the hill and dale, the low and elevated ground, that enter into its super ficial composition. There is abundance of peat-moss. Much corn is raised, but of an indifferent quality ; the grass is excellent for producing milk and butter, and feeding black cattle ; and, in the strong rapid tides and boisterous seas which encircle the Island in every quarter, there is such plenty offish ofthe very best kind, that, when the weather is mild, and the sea so smooth that the boats can get off to the fishing-ground, which lies at a considerable distance, they seldom return without an ample reward for their labour. A few hands, of late, have been employed in the lobster-fishing ; but the bulk of the people here, as in other places, spend the winter in idleness, the spring in the culture of their fields, and the summer, except during a few intervals that are employed in fishing, in the manufacture of kelp ; in which their labour produces, at an average, 300 tons annually. Though, on the East and South, there are two Bays, where ships may ride for some time in summer, the only Harbour that can be depended upou, is that called Piernr' Wall, on the North-East, and this is fit"], [811, "WES for small Vessels only : formerly, it afforded accommodation for ships of much greater burden, and it is still sheltered in all directions ; but, from the blowing of the sand, which of late has been very great, the water has become so shallow, that ships which have occasion to put in here, are compelled to anchor in a more open road farther out in the Harbour. The blowing of the sand has also spread desolation over some ofthe most beautiful and best land, not onlv in this Island, but also in Sanday. Along the shores, are some of those ruins denominated Picts' Houses. Tumuli or Barrows are also not unfrequent ; as are the remains of some Popish Chapels, for which the Inhabitants, until lately, showed no small degree of veneration. Little farther than half a mile from the manse, appear two graves'; one of them much larger than the other, the least being inclosed within a circle of stones ; and both of them formed of four stones, placed at equal distances from each other ; and human bones are frequently found near them : \u2014 In two pretty extensive plains by the sea-side ; the one on the South, and the other on the North side ofthe Island, the blowing of the sand has exposed a mul titude of graves, all of them formed in nearly the same manner ; and, though tradition ventures to give no account of them, they have probably been the effects of conflict and carnage in some remote period ; some of these graves to the North have been opened, in which not only human bones and skeletons, in a reclining posture, were discovered, but also warlike weapons, domestic utensils, and several other articles, the use of which could not be ascertained with certainty. Close by this dreary waste, is the pleasant Town of Waal, the name of which has perhaps some reference to the event that must have long been perpetuated in this field of slaughter. By the side of it, on the borders of a beautiful Loch of fresh water, with a gentle declivity towards the sea, stands the noble ruinous Castle of Naltland, which is believed, though erroneously, to have been built for the reception ofthe unfortunate Mary, and her profligate paramour Bothw^ell, when their enemies drove them to the last extremity. Trenaby is the Seat of John Bai.four, Esq. : and Brough, is the hospitable Mansion of Mr. Stewart. Here are three water-mills, and one wind-mill. Lord Dundas is the Superior. This Island is entirely composed of sandstone and sandstone flag. WEST STRUTHER, in the Shire of Berwick: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3101..14..0.

N W. from Green law, This Parish is about five miles long, and four miles broad : it lies on the South side of that rauge of hills, called Lammer-Muir , by which it is separated from East Lothian : about one half of the Parish is hilly, and fit only for pasture ; the remainder is flat, and is either under cultivation or susceptible of improve ment: the great London Road, by Coldstream, passes through the South-West side of it for the space of about four miles, and then enters the Parish of Green law : the Cross roads are very bad. Poor's Rates are established here. The Parish of West Struther is modern : in the Seventeenth Century, it was formed, by uniting to the Parish of Bassendean the Lands of West Struther, and the ancient territory of Spottiswoode, which had belonged to the Parish of Gordon : In 1647, the Lands of West Struther, Spottiswoode, and others, were, upon a represen tation of their distance from the Church of Gordon, annexed to the Parish of Bassendean : and, a new Church, having been built about the year 1649, upon a more central site, at the Village of West Struther, gave its obscure name to the Parish : implying, The Village in the Marsh. It appears, that this Marsh was denominated West Struther, in contradistinction to another extensive Marsh, at some distance, Eastward, which is now called Dogden-Moss. The Village of West Struther has of late been considerably increased by a number of houses, built on feus: each feu, along with a house and small garden, has generally two or more acres of land to supply the family with corn, and potatoes. The Village of Wederley is much diminished within these Forty years. The Village of Hounslow is entirely a new erection ; the first house in it having been built in the year 1775; it consists of feus granted by Mr. Home, of Bas sendean, and has very much improved the appearance of the country around, as well as raised the value ofthe adjacent lands : it is situate on the great London road. The feuars in the Villages of West Struther, and Hounslow, have each a privilege of peats for fuel in the mosses that are next to them. The Climate of this Parish is considerably colder than the lower parts ofthe country : it is, however remarkakly healthy. See, Bassendean, and Gordon. WEST VOE, v. DUNROSS-NESS. WEST-WATER, v.

This Town is pleasantly situate on the Western side of the Bay of Wigtown, and consists principally of one well built street. It is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, and 15 Counsellors ; and unites with the Royal Boroughs of New Galloway, Wigtown, and Stranraer, in sending one Member to Parliament. Whitehorn is a place of very great antiquity, having been the Roman Station, Leucophibia, or Candida Casa, of Bede, and the Capital ofthe Novantes, who possessed all Galloway beyond the river Dee : and it was so early the Seat of Religion, that, according to Mr. Pinkerton, the Bishopric of Galloway or Whitehorn is the oldest in Scotland. The Cathedral, of which there are now scarcely any remains, was founded in the Fourth Century by St. Ninian, who dedicated it to St. Martin. There was also a famous Priory ofthe Premonstratensian Order, which was founded, and very richly endowed, by Fergus, Lord of Galloway. Tbe air is dry, and healthy. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees : besides which, there are other two Schools. The tanning of leather has been carried on here for several years to a considerable extent, and several cotton manufactures have been commenced. \u2014 The Parish of Whitehorn is about 8 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, occupying that extremity ofthe Peninsula ofthe Shire of Wigtown, which is formed by the Bays of Wigtown and Luce : the surface is diversified with hills, and vallies ; and the soil is, in general, fertile, and the farms are mostly inclosed, and well cultivated. There are very extensive Plantations, which are in a flourishing condition. Here are considerable Quarries of very fine variegated marble, and strong slate ; and there are many promising appear ances of lead, and copper mines, but as yet none have been worked. The ex tent of sea coast is about 9 miles ; the shore, near Burgh Head, is bold, and every where rocky : the Bays are those of Port Allan, Port Yarrock, and The Isle of Whitehorn \u25a0' from Port Yarrock round Burgh Head, the tide flows close alono- the shore three hours, and ebbs nine : and from The Ross of Kirkcud bright to The Mull of Galloway, it flows and ebbs six hours. Off this coast, the brave Admiral Elliot defeated the French squadron under Thurot, in 1760. The Isle of Whitehorn contains a pretty large Village and has a good natural"], [816, "W H I Harbour, improved by a Quay: the entrance is narrow, but the anchoring ground is very safe : here one of His Majesty's Revenue Cutters is usually stationed ; and from hence vessels sail to Whitehaven, and Workington in four Hours : to The Isle of Man in three ; and to Dublin, Greenock, and Liverpool in eighteen. Near the Isle of Whitehorn, are the ruins ofa Church, with a Burying ground, which is said to have been the first Christian place of Worship in Scotland. Upon the coast, are the remains of several Camps and Castles : especially at Carghidoun, which covers about half an acre of ground ; \u2014 Castle Feather, which covers nearly an acre ; \u2014 and at Burgh Head, there are ancient works that extend over an area of three acres ; within a mile of the Town are the remains of the Roman Camp. Castle Wigg, a venerable old edifice, is the family seat of Hugh Hathorn, Esq. ; \u2014 and, at Tonderghie, Hugh Stewart, Esq., has built an elegant modern Mansion, which commands an extensive view of England, and ofThelsleofMan. WHITE ISLAND, one of The Scilly Islands. This is a small Island, con taining only 50 acres. It is 2\\ m. W. from St. Mary's. WHITE-KIRK, anciently HAMER, in the Shire of Hadington : formerly a Rectory, comprehending the ancient Parishes of Aldham, and Tyningham, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3156. : Patrons, by turns, The Crown, in right of While-Kirk, and The Earl of Hadington, in virtue of Tyningham : The Church of Hamer, which was dedicated to The Virgin Mary, was early called White-Kirk, from the whiteness of its appearance ; and at length became, in the popular tradition, the name ofthe Village, and Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Dunbar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 925, and, in 1811, was 957. It is 3{ m. SE. b. S. from North Berwick. During the Seventeenth Century, the Parish of White- Kirk was augmented, by the annexation ofthe little Parish of Aldham : and, in 1761, to this United Parish was annexed the adjoining Parish of Tyningham. The present Parish of White-Kirk, thus comprehending the ancient Parishes of Tyningham, Aldham, and Hamer, is about 6 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth. It is bounded on the North, and East, by the German Ocean. The surface is level, and the soil is in general a rich gravelly loam, very favourable for agricultural purposes : and the whole is in a good state of cultivation. The climate is dry, pleasant, and healthful. There are two established Schools in the Parish ; one of them at White-Kirk, and the other at Tyningham. The extent of the Sea Coast is about three miles : and, in the North part of it, is a"], [817, "W H I number of rocks, which have been fatal to mariners at various times. See, Ald ham, and Tyningham.

It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801 (comprehending the two ancient Parishes of Whitsome, and Hilton, which were united in the year 1735) was 560, and, in 1811, was 536. It is 7 m. N. from Coldstream. The United Parishes are about 4\\ miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth. The land under cultivation is mostly a deep rich clay, but there is a considerable extent of moory and marshy ground. This Parish belongs to a number of Proprietors ; none of whom reside, except Joshua Tait, Esq., of Langrigg, an estate of 186 acres English measure, which is skilfully cultivated, and gives a vote for a Member of Parliament ; it pays only 6s.. Sd. to the Minster. The Village of Whitsome, the only one now in the United Parishes, is very inconsiderable, and has no trade, nor manufac ture of any kind. It is watered by the small river Leet. WHITTINGHAM in the Shire of Haddington. This Parish formed of old two Chapelries, which were subordinate to the Church of Dunbar ; the Lower part of the Parish was served by the Chapel of Whittingham ; and the Higher part, in the Lammer-Muir, was served by the Chapel of Penshiel : and those two Chapels constituted two ofthe Prebends ofthe Collegiate Church, when it was settled under that form, in 1342 : the Stipend, inlSll, being \u00a3150., together with a good garden, and a glebe : the manse, and offices, are in good order ; Patron, Hay, of Drummelzier: The Church of Whittingham is in excellent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dunbar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 658, and, in 1811,\\yas 616; vol. ii. 5 K"], [818, "W 1 c It is 5\\ m. E. b. S, from Hadington. This Parish is about 11 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, containing 9267 Scotch acres ; of which, 5870 lie among the hills of Lammer-Muir, and 3397 are low, and flat. About 6000 Sheep are bred in the hilly District. The low ground is all arable, and well cultivated, the greater part being inclosed. On the Farm of Priest-Law, in the Lammer- Muir, is a strong encampment, of an oval form, the parts of which are very entire, and in circumference about 2000 feet. Both the Higher and the Lower parts of the Parish are remarkably healthy. The Roads are in good repair. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, together with perquisites, a house, and good garden. The only Mansions in the Parish, are Whittingham House, and Rush- Law ; both of them exhibiting evident marks of great antiquity ; but the former, which is the Family seat of Hay, of Drummelzier, is remarked for its delightful situation. Here the Earls of March held their Baronial Courts. WHITTON, NETHER and UPPER, v. MORBOTLE.

Scotch per boll, according to a decreet in 1775: together with a good manse, and offices, built in 1786, and a garden, with a glebe and some inclosures and improvements: Patron, Sir Benjamin Dunbar, Bart., of Hempriggs : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Fergus, is an old, dark, and ill-constructed building. It is in the Presbytery of Caithness, and Synod of Caithness and Sutherland. The Resident Population of this Town and Parish, in 1801, was 3986, and, in 1811, was 5080. It is 279 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Market is on Friday, and is well supplied. It is situate at the entrance of the small river Wick, the \u00c6stuary whereof forms a good Harbour. The Town, and Borough lands of Wick, were anciently a part of the Earldom ofCAiTNEss; on the Petition of George Earl of Caithness, a Charter was granted by James the Sixth of Scotland, on the 24th of September 1589, erecting the Town of Wick into a Royal Borough, under the Superiority of that Nobleman : on the 8th of October, 1672, the whole Earldom of Caithness, including the lands and"], [819, "W I c tenements ofthe Town of Wick, were disponed to John Campbell, of Glen- urchay, afterwards created Earl of Breadalbane ; by whose successor in title they were sold, in 1718, to the Family of Sinclair, of Ulbster. On a general order from The Convention of Royal Burghs, the Sett or Government of the Borough of Wick, was ultimately fixed in 1716, by which, the consent of the original Founders ofthe Borough, or their Successors, was declared to be always necessary to the election of the Magistrates. By this Sett, the old Magistrates make out a leet of two persons, out of whom a Provost, four out of whom two Baillies, are to be chosen by the free Burgesses ; and the leet must be presented 30 days before Michaelmas, and approved by the Superior, otherwise the election is void, and a new leet must be made out. When the Provost, and two Baillies, are elected, they have the right of choosing seven Counsellors, a Treasurer, and a Dean of Guild. In consequence of these regulations, Sir John Sinclair, Bart., Hereditary Provost, and his Predecessors, have annually been in the practice of approving a leet presented to them, of the Magistrates to be chosen. Wick, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Dingwall, Dornoch, Kirkwall, and Tain, sends one Member to Parliament. The Income of the Borough is very trifling, but is on the increase, and arises from the Customs payable on different articles sold in the Market, from Shore dues on ships, &c. It pays no part of the Minister's Stipend, nor of the Schoolmaster's salary, nor has it any real property in the Church : its Tollbooth is the County Gaol. This is the Shire Town, and the Seat ofthe Sheriff-Court. A General Post-Office is established here. The chief branch of Commerce and Industry is the Fisheries, which are prosecuted with great attention and success. Besides the Parochial School in Wick, the Salary of which is 300 merks ; there are also several private teachers, and six Charity Schools with established Salaries ; viz., one at Barroch, with a salary of \u00a310.; three at Kiess, with salaries of \u00a310.. 9., and \u00a34. ; one at Thrumster, with a salary of \u00a310. ; and one at Ulbster, with a Salary of \u00a34. The Parish of Wick is about 20 miles in length, and 10 miles in breadth : the surface is, in general, flat, open, and champaign ; and though immense tracts are uncul- tivated, or covered with heath, yet the greater part might easily be converted into good arable land : but agriculture is still in its infancy here ; and, in many places, the absurd distinction of in-field, and out-field, is still preserved, and green crops and fallow are little used. The climate is healthy. The Coast is rocky, and is indented with various creeks, which afford secure shelter for fishing boats, particularly at Staxigoe, Broad-Haven, and Louisburgh. The principal 5 K 2"], [820, "W I c Promontory is Noss Head, which is very lofty and rocky, and visible at a vast distance at sea. About 40 or 50 Tons of Kelp are annually made here. During the season of incubation, prodigious numbers of aquatic birds of all kinds, frequent the rocks. There are several fresh water lakes that abound with trout, and are much resorted to by wild Swans. At Keiss, one of the estates of Sir John Sin- clair, is an excellent Mansion-House ; and near it, is the old Castle of Keiss, where the Earls of Caithness occasionally resided : this estate, as well as the neighbouring one of Nybster belonging to Mr. Sinclair, of Freswick, abound with peat-moss ; and at Nybster, and Sarclett, are small Salt-pans, where an inferior kind of salt is made. Close to each other, upon the coast, are the two Castles Sinclair, and Gimigoe, formerly the residence ofthe Earls of Caithness : and not far from these venerable ruins, is Ackergill Tower, once the residence ofthe Earls Marischal, but now the beautiful Seat of Sir Benjamin Dunbar, Bart., of Hempriggs, the worthy proprietor of a very considerable estate in the neigh- bourhood. The Castle of Old Wick, now a ruin, is built upon a narrow Promon- tory, forming a good Beacon at sea, and is called by mariners, The Old Man of Wick: it was once the residence ofthe Lords Oliphant, a dormant title, one of whom is said to have been murdered at a place not far distant from his Castle, Ulbster is the property of The Right Honourable Sir John Sinclair, and from whence this respectable and patriotic Baronet derives his Family title. The im- politic system of unlimited Services is still preserved in many parts ofthe Parish. At Old Namerluch a battle was fought in 1680, between The Earl of Caithness, and Lord Glenurchay. In the old Chapel near Castle Sinclair, called St. Teay, several Gentlemen of the name of Gun, and others, were basely murdered by Keith Earl Marischal, in the Fifteenth Century. Bya Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, on the 4th of February 1805, by The Governor and Directors of The British Society of Fisheries, it appears, \" That with a view of promoting the Deep-sea Fishing, aster due inves- tigation, your Memorialists have purchased a tract of land situated on the North- East coast ofthe County of Caithness, and on the South side ofthe river Wick, where it is intended to form a Harbour for the promotion of Fishing and Coasting Vessels, and a proper settlement on shore for the accommodation of Fishermen, Artificers, and other Persons connected with the Fishery business. On the North side ofthe river stands the present Town of Wick, and a very consider- able tract of country extends beyond this to the Pentland Firth, and opposite to the Orkneys, to which Islands there is a communication by means of a Ferry."], [821, "W I G The communication from this District to the Southward is by the Town of Wick, and the passage across the riverwas formerly effected by means of a wooden bridge, which is now decayed and perfectly useless, and consequently the intercourse is interrupted, and rendered very dangerous. It being well known, that the render ing this communication perfect is of great importance to the general welfare of this part ofthe North of Scotland, and to the Orkney Islands, and as it would, if so perfected, greatly contribute to the prosperity of the Fishery settlement which your Memorialists have undertaken to establish, it is presumed that this Bridge falls precisely under the description of those which have a just claim to the aid of one Moiety of the expense from the Public ; this Society undertaking that the other Moiety shall be paid. The expense, as stated to us by Mr. Telford, who has examined the situation, amounts to \u00a32000.\" A substantial Bridge of three arches (the water-way being 156 feet), and the approaches to it through the Town, and the road to the Harbour, were accordingly completed, and final pay ment made in the month of November 1809. An excellent line of road from The Ord of Caithness to Wick has also been made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, a distance of 34 \\ miles. The Harbour of Wick has been gradually formed by The British Fishery Society, with the help ofa Parliamentary Grant of \u00a37500. from the Fund of the Forfeited Estates, and is found to be ofthe greatest utility to the Fishing Busses, and other vessels, navi gating this Coast.

This is a very ancient Town, and is supposed to have received its Charter of erection into a Royal Borough, during the reign of King Robert Bruce. It is pleasantly situate on the side ofa hill, near the confluence of the river Bladenoch with a large Bay to which it gives name : the sands opposite to the Town are dry at low water. It is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, and 12 Counsellors : and, with the Royal Boroughs of Whitehorn, New Galloway, and Stranraer, sends one Member to Parliament. The Climate is cold, but healthful. This is a Port of the Custom-house, comprehending the Creeks of the Shire of Wigtown, from The Mull of Galloway, to the Mouth of the river Dee. It is the Shire Town, and where the Sheriff Courts are holden. A General Post-Office is established here. The Grammar School is conducted by a very able Rector, and his Assistant ; the salary being \u00a330., of which \u00a324. are paid by the Corporation, and the remainder by the Heritors, together with School fees ; the whole of the emoluments amounting to about \u00a360. Sterling per annum. Peat is abundant, and is the common fuel ; but coals are also imported from Whitehaven and Liverpool. The Parish of Wigtown comprehends about 5500 acres : it is watered by the river Bladenoch, and exhibits a great diversity of soil, and surface : towards the South it is interspersed with hills, which are almost entirely arable, with a dry, light, and fertile mould : the North-West corner is more varied, and less productive ; and the North-East part is princi pally covered with moss, and appears to have been formerly an arm of the sea. The greater part is inclosed ; and the spirit of improvement is much encouraged here. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. In the Western part of the Parish, is a large circle of stones, called The Standing Stones of Torhouse, which is thought to have been a Temple of the Druids. Wigtown gave the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Fleming, extinct or dormant in 1760. The Convent of Dominicans here was founded in 1267, by Dervorgilla, Daughter to Alan Lord of Galloway, and Mother to John Baliol King of Scotland. WIGTOWN, SHIRE. This Shire is sometimes called Upper or West Galloway, and contains 238,721 Scottish acres. The soil along the Coast is tolerably fertile: but the interior and Northern parts are barren and hilly, and are principally appropriated to the pasturage of black cattle, and sheep. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 22,918, and, in 1811, was 26,891. It sends one Member to Parliament. WILLIAM'S CROSS, v. PHILIPHAUGH."], [823, "W I N WILLOW-GATE, v. KINNOUL.

This Parish contains about 5000 acres of land, which stretch along the banks of the Teviot, and are in general fertile, and well cultivated. There are several marie pits in the neighbourhood, and lime-stone is obtained in abund ance. The Parochial Schoolmaster has the legal Salary of 300 merks, a dwell ing-house, and School-house : There are also two Village schools. The great est disadvantage which it sustains, is the scarcity of fuel. It is famous for the manufacture of Carpets, often called from this place, Wilton Carpets. Here is also a manufactory of Inkle, and Hose. Wilton Lodge is the residence of Francis Lord Napier, Lord Lieutenant of the Shire of Selkirk, and His Majesty's High Commissioner to The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

It is situate upon a rising ground on the Turnpike road between Glasgow and Peebles, about 15 miles distant from the former place, which furnishes employment for the greater part ofthe Inhabitants. Since the middle of the Eighteenth Century, it consisted only of a few mean Cottages ; but, from the Public spirit of the Proprietors in granting feus upon the most liberal terms, and being in the immediate vicinity of coals, and free stone, it has risen in a short time to its present flourishing condition ; and en hanced the value of the land, which was occasionally let at half a crown an acre, to from Four to Five pounds. The soil is a stiff clay, but by culti vation and the shelter afforded from the thriving hedges, it yields excellent crops. It is also peculiarly favourable for Fruit-trees, of which almost every feuar has some in his Garden : and Sir James Steuart has planted about 80 Scotch acres in Orchards, chiefly on the banks of the Clyde, within the last Twenty years. This Gentleman has likewise begun to cultivate a large moss in the neighbourhood ; thirty acres of which are laid down with Fiorin grass. WISP, The, v. CAVERS.

YARROW, in the Shire of Selkirk : formerly a Rectory : Patrons, The Crown, and The Marquis of Lothian : In former times the Parochial Church stood in a situation, and went by a name, very different from its present position and denomination ; it was situate upon the side of St. Mary's Loch, and was styled St. Mary's Kirk ; but as this is the very Western extremity of the Parish, it was found extremely inconvenient for the generality of the Parishioners ; and, accordingly, about the year 1640, it was judged necessary to alter the place of Worship, and to erect the present Church, which is about 8 miles to the East ward of the old one, and much more central for the Parish : but, although the"], [827, "Y A R situation ofthe Church was changed, that ofthe glebe was continued, consist- ing wholly of sheep pasture, and containing at least 200 acres of land : the old Burial ground also remains, and is still employed as such : the Stipend, in 1811, being \u00a3166. Sterling : there has been no augmentation since the year 1731, but the funds are very great. It is in the Presbytery of Selkirk, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2116, and, in 1811, was 1225. It is 8 m. W. from Selkirk. This Parish is about 18 miles in length, and 16 miles at its greatest breadth, and is calculated to con- tain 60,000 acres ; very little of which is inclosed. The general appearance of the country is mountainous, the prospect on all sides being bounded by towering summits ; some of which are of great altitude, particularly those called Black- house Heights, which are elevated 2370 feet above the level of the sea. The soil is various ; in some parts of the vallies, it is deep and fertile ; in others, it is light and unproductive ; upon the hills it partakes also of considerable variety: and it is principally appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The air, upon the whole, is moist and raw, but not unhealthy. The great dis- advantage of the whole of this neighbourhood, is the distance from coals, and lime ; the fuel generally made use of is peat, which in the upper part ofthe Parish is of an excellent quality, and found in great abundance ; but, in the lower part, it is both scarce and bad, The want of free-stone is also an in convenience. The roads are indifferent. There are two Lochs, adjoining to each other, partly in this Parish, and partly in that of Etterick : one of them is called, The Loch ofthe Lowes, and the other, St. Mary's Loch ; the extent of the former is inconsiderable; but the latter is about three miles long, and, in some places, one mile broad. The only rivers in this Parish are the Etterick, and Yarrow : the latter takes its rise from St. Mary's Loch, and aster an East- erly course of 15 miles is absorbed in the Etterick, a little above Selkirk: both of these rivers run with great rapidity, and often swell to a prodigious height ; small salmon occasionally ascend their streams ; but the fish, with which they chiefly abound, are trout, of a delicious flavour. This Parish formerly abounded with wood, insomuch that it received the designation of Etterick Forest : But the name is now egregiously misapplied, as every remnant ofthe old Wood has entirely disappeared : from the great quantities of Oak still found in the mosses, it seems to have constituted the principal species : New Plantations are, however, much promoted : and at Hanging -Share, the once beautiful, but now ruinous Seat ofthe Murrays, of Philiphaugh, there is a considerable quantity of thriv ing wood ; and numerous clumps of planting have also been made upon most of 5L2"], [828, "Y A R the farms belonging to The Duke of Buccleugh. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is in a very flourishing state, is 300 merks Scotch, together with a Schoolhouse in excellent repair, which is well calculated for the accommoda- tion of Boarders. Besides the Parochial School, there is another which is situate upon the river Etterick: but for this School there is no Salary allotted, the Schoolmaster having nothing to depend upon for his subsistence, but the emolu- ments arising from the School-fees, and a guinea gratuitously given annually by The Duke of Buccleugh : the School-house is in good order. Here are numer- ous remains of old Castles, formerly the seats of the feudal Barons. Mary Scott, \" the Flower of Yarrow,\" so highly celebrated in song, was a native of this Parish. According to tradition, she was the daughter of Walter Scott, Esq., of Dryhope, and was esteemed the fairest and most handsome woman in the Forest: hence she had many suitors, who solicited the honour ofa matrimonial alliance with her: in preference to all other candidates, she gave her hand to Gilbert Scott, of Harden ; from this alliance there sprung a daughter, who was afterwards married to the eldest son ofthe Baronet of Stobs, commonly called \" Gibby with the-golden garters:\" from them are descended the present Sir William Elliot, of Stobs, and the late Lord Heathfield, the brave Defender of Gibraltar. There is a curious circumstance relating to their marriage con- tract, which strongly marks the predatory spirit of the times : finding it incon- venient to take his wife home, Gibby besought his father-in-law to maintain her for some time : with this request he complied, upon condition that he was to receive, for her board, \" the plunder of the first harvest Moon :\" a most singular compact, and highly characteristic ofthe licentiousness and barbarity of the age in which it was made. This Parish also gave birth to a famous military character, Colonel William Russell, of Ashysteel, who signalised himself so gallantly at the capture of Manilla. The Yarrow, that sweet and pastoral Stream, has often been celebrated iu Scottish song ; and sometimes the plaintive and sympathiz ing Muse hath \" Mourn'd on Yarrow's banks, the widow'd maid.\" Burns, in his Address to the Shade of Thomson, emphatically exclaims ; While maniac winter rages o'er The hills, whence classic Yarrow flows ; Rousing the turbid torrent's roar, Or sweeping wild a waste of snows.\" \u2014"], [829, "Y E L According to Mr. Chalmers, the Parish of Yarrow comprehends within its ample limits the old Parishes of Duchoire, St. Mary's, and Kirk-Hope. \u2014 Duchoire, derived its Celtic name, from the Gaelic Du-choire, signifying what the thing is, a small valley through which a rivulet finds its course to the Yarrow. At the entrance of this Valley, on the North-West side of the Yarrow, stood the ancient Church of Duchoire, now corrupted to Deuchar. The District, which was anciently attached to Duchoire Church, composes the East part of Yarrow Parish. \u2014 St. Mary's Church derived its name, from The Virgin, to whom it was dedicated : it stood near the entrance ofa small valley, anciently called Far-mains-hope, lying on the North West side of a beautiful Lake which was called from it St. Mary's Loch, and colloquially St. Mary's Kirk of the Lowes : in Charters it was described as the Church of Tlie Virgin Mary, in Etterick Forest : the old Parish of St. Mary's forms the West part of the present Parish. \u2014 The Church of Kirk-Hope was situate in a valley, which derived from the name of Kirk-Hope, through which a rivulet finds its devious course to the Etterick, below Etterick Bridge : the District which was attached to this Kirk, now forms the East, and South-East part of the Parish of Yarrow. In July 1292, Edward the First directed the Chancellor of Scotland the present Edmond de Letham to the Church of Tlie Virgin Mary of Farmains-hope, in the Diocese of Glasgow, which was void, by the resignation of Aimer de Softlaw. In 1296, Edmond de Letham, Parson ofthe Church ofthe Forest, swore fealty to Edward the First, and was, in return, restored to his rights. It is doubtful, whether the advowson of this Church remained long with the Monks of Dryburgh ; as it seems to have continued a Rectory, until the Reformation. See, Kershope. YELL, ISLAND, one of the Shetland Isles ; in which are the Parishes of North Yell, Mid, and South Yell : \u2014 The Vicarage of North Yell was united to the Vicarage of Fetlar in 1709, and now constitutes part of that Minister's Charge, being called The Parish of North Yell and Fetlar: The Church is in good repair. \u2014 The United Parishes of Mid and South Yell constitute a separate Charge, the Stipend being, in 1811, together with the glebe, 178 lispunds and 10 merks of butter, 70 lambs and T5T ofa lamb, and 4 merks of wool with every lamb, 211 ling and \u00b1 of a ling, 503j cans of oil, \u00a3175.. 15.. 0.

The Island ofYELL is about 18 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, The coast is bold, and rocky, and intersected by several Voes or Bays, which form safe Harbours : the principal of them being Refirth Voe, Bura Voe, Hamma Voe, and Whalfirth Voe. The surface is pretty level. The inhabitants are, in general, healthy, and instances of longevity are not unfrequent: they are chiefly occupied in Fishing. \u2014 The Parish of North Yell comprises about 636 merk- lands, each about a quarter of an acre. The soil is a deep black morass, full of ferruginous springs, \u2014 The United Parishes of Mid and South Yell con- tain about 1100 merk-lands, which do not much exceed 500 Scotch acres : the arable land principally consists of some cultivated spots, lying along the Sea- coast : the inland parts of the Island are mostly hills, covered with peat moss : there is very little heath, but abundance of a rough sort of grass, which is here called Lubbo, that grows naturally, and affords tolerable pasture for sheep, horses, and black cattle. By the benevolent exertions of the late Sir Hew Dalrymple, Bart, of North Berwick, whose celebrated Letter to Sir Laurence Dundas (in 1775) has frequently been printed, The Rev. Andrew Dishington was made Minister of this Parish. The coast abounds with fish. At Gossa- burgh is a safe landing-place ; around which the fields are so small, that they appear like little gardens : instead ofa plough, a coarse kind of awkward spade is employed ; and as the men dig the fields, the women and children, it is said, \" drag the harrows.\" YESTER, or YSTRAD, i. e. The Vale, in the Shire of Hadington. According to Mr. Chalmers, the old name ofthe Parish of Yester was Bothan's, when the seat of the Family of Tw7eeddale was at the old Castle, about a mile from their present Residence : but, after the Reformation, the family having lest the Castle, built the House which they called Yester, the Baronial name of the extensive domains of the Giffords. William, the Lion, granted to Hugh de Gifford the lands of Yestred, who gave to the Monks of Melros a toft, in his"], [831, "YES village of Yestred. The Baronial Domains of Yester lie along the vale of a rivulet, which is formed from several streamlets that fall down from the Western declivities ofthe Lammer-Muir : in this Vale or Strath, on the West bank ofthe water, stands Yester-House, the splendid Mansion of The Marquis of Tweeddale. The Patronage ofthe Church has belonged to the Lords ofthe Manor of Yestred, from the Twelfth century to the present time. This Manor was granted by William the Lion, to Hugh Gifford, the son of Hugh, an English Gentleman, who settled in Lothian, under David the First. From that early age to the present, Yestred has remained with his descendants. Hugh Gifford of Yester, who lived under David the Second and Robert the Second, had only four Daughters to inherit his large Estates : and, Johanna, the eldest, marrying Sir William Hay, of Lochericart, transferred the Manor, with the Patronage ofthe Church, to him and their conjoint posterity, thus arose the Family of Yester, and Locherwart, who obtained the titles of Lord Yester in 1488, Earl of Tweeddale in 1646, and Marquis of Tweeddale in 1694. Sir William Hay, in 1420, con- verted the Church of St. Bothan, into a Collegiate form ; consisting of a Provost, six Prebendaries, and two Singing-boys, who enjoyed the lands, tythes, and other Church revenues ofthe Parish, until the Reformation: the Church now lost its Collegiate form, the name of St. Bothan was no longer reverenced, and the ancient name of Yester became the name of the Parish. In 1708, a new Parish Church, and manse, were built, in a less central place, at the Village of Gifford ; and the ancient Church of St. Bothan, with its adjacent Kirk-town, were resigned to decay. From the Village, where the modern Church stands, the Parish is now popularly called Gifford, while the legal name is Yester. The Marquis of Tweeddale is Patron of the Living, which, including the glebe, is upwards of \u00a3154., together with a good manse, and garden. It is in the Pres- bytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 929, and, in 1811, was 1013. It is 4 m. S. from Hadington. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, without including that portion which makes part of Lammer-Muir , and extends two miles farther to the Southward : this latter district is hilly, and covered with heath ; but the rest ofthe Parish is level, and mostly arable, with a fertile, but rather shallow soil. The air is pure, and very healthy. A Dispen- sary has been instituted here, for distributing medicines, and giving medical advice to the poor, gratis, which is of great benefit to the country. The Village"], [832, "YET of Gifford is situate on the East bank of Gifford water, in the lower end ofthe Parish, and is a Burgh of Barony, giving the title of Earl to The Marquis of Tweeddale. A great part of the Walls of the large and ancient Castle of Yester or Bothan's are still standing : there is a tradition, that it was the last fortification in this country which surrendered to General Gray, who was sent into Scotland by The Protector Somerset : a considerable part ofthe wood with which it is almost surrounded, is within the limits of the Parish of Garvald. At Duncan-law, in the North-East corner of the Parish, there was formerly a Chapel, dedicated to St. Nicholas, and which belonged to the family of Gifford. The Village of Gifford is supposed to have been the place of nativity of the celebrated John Knox ; but the tradition of the country fixes his birth at Hadington. YETBYRE, v. ESK-DALE-MUIR. YETHOLM, or ZET-HAM, i. e. The Dicelling at the Gate, or on the Road, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 46-j bolls of oat-meal, 14^ bolls of barley, 5 bolls of wheat, all in Teviotdale measure, and \u00a338.. 17. .9^ in money, a manse, and glebe, and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : Patron, Andrew Wauchope, Esq., of Niddrie : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Kelso, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1011, and, in 1811, was 1138. It is 9 m. S. E. from Kelso. The Market is on Wednesday. The Fairs are on the 5th of July, and 31st of October. This Parish is about 4f miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth ; it is bounded on the East and South by the English Border, and is divided into two nearly equal parts by the small river Bowmont ; the surface is hilly, but the hills are covered with verdure, and are pastured by a very considerable number of sheep and lambs. There are some large Haughs on the banks of the Boicmont, and about 1170 English acres of good land are under tillage. Where this Parish marches with that of Morbotle, there is a Lake of about a mile in circumference, which abounds with pike, and perch. The Town of Yetholm is pleasantly situate on the Bowmont Water, which divides it into two Villages ; the one, on the North-West side, called Town Yetholm, beino the property of Andrew Wauchope, Esq., of Niddrie; and the other, on the South East side, called Kirk Yetholm, belonging to The Marquis of Tweedale, This Town has long been inhabited by Tinkers and Gypsies.
